Fortum has signed an agreement to divest a cumulative 500 MW of solar power plants in India to UK-based emerging market investor Actis. 
Actis will acquire the 250 MW Pavagada II solar plant in Karnataka and another 250 MW in Rajasthan for approximately €280 million on a debt-free and cash-free basis. Most of this value will be recorded during 2021. 
The divestment will be completed and the capital gain recorded in three tranches; during the second half of 2021 and the first half of 2022.
The divestment is expected to have a positive impact of approximately €20 million on the results of Fortum’s City Solutions segment.
Fortum and Actis have also signed a comprehensive agreement targeting further investments in solar power plants in India.
“We can utilize the strong competencies Fortum has gained over the years in solar development and construction, while utilizing the financial strength and track record of Actis to realize the investment potential,” said Per Langer, executive vice president of Fortum’s City Solutions division.
“This is an important step for Actis as we further strengthen our presence in India building on our achievements to date. We are pleased to be entering into this transaction with a firm of Fortum’s calibre and competence,” said Mikael Karlsson, partner and head of Energy Infrastructure at Actis.
Since 2013, Fortum has developed and constructed 680 MW of solar power in India. Over time, most of this capacity has been divested to enable further investments with limited equity exposure, in line with the build-operate-transfer business model.

Spanish renewable energy company Acciona has connected to the grid the first storage station developed with recycled batteries at its 1.2 MW photovoltaic park in Tudela, in Spain's Navarra region, as part of a joint project developed with the startup BeePlanet under the umbrella of Acciona's open innovation program, I’mnovation.
Acciona has installed four second-life batteries from car manufacturer Nissan with a combined capacity of 130 kWh at its solar park. The battery station will be operated by the company's Renewable Energy Control Center with its global GEMS energy management platform and renewable energy will be certified throughout the process through Acciona's Greenchain platform, based on blockchain. The company will also conduct a comparative analysis to verify whether recycled batteries can offer the same benefits as first-use batteries.
Acciona's director of energy innovation, Belén Linares, explained that second-life batteries can be “an ideal option to complement self-consumption facilities, electric vehicle recharging networks, and micro-grids.”
According to BeePlanet, the batteries used in the project have more than 80% of their original capacity operational and a maximum of 5% is discharged in 24 hours, to ensure the maximum performance.
The Spanish start-up announced in May the launch of a new storage system of up to 1 MWh with second-life batteries, which it called Power ESS. The system can be used in the commercial and industrial, primary and construction sectors and can be integrated with photovoltaic and wind plants.
It is a flexible and modular system. Starting from a 42 kWh rack, it can be expanded by modules connected in parallel up to 1 MWh. “In this way, once we have dimensioned the project, we install the necessary racks, knowing that if capacity needs to be expanded in the future, it will be very simple,” the company explained.
The system can be installed indoors and outdoors. Turnkey Power ESS containerized solutions are installed outdoors. The equipment is made up of replaceable units. “In this way, we are able to increase the life cycle of the installation. When we detect, through remote maintenance, that there is a … unit that has reached its capacity limit, we take care of replacing and recycling it,” it went on to say.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/22/fimer-launches-two-new-inverters-for-large-scale-projects/,"INVERTERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"JUNE 22, 2021",Fimer launches two new inverters for large scale projects,"Italian inverter maker Fimer unveiled today two new products for the large scale segment – a high-power, multi-MPPT string inverter and modular conversion solution designed to supply both decentralized and centralized systems.
The new PVS-350, with a power of 350 kVA and an efficiency of over 99% is, according to the company, the most powerful string multi-MPPT inverter (350 kVA) with the highest power density in the solar industry. The device can perform string diagnostics through the online analysis of I-V curves.
According to Fimer, the inverter's capacity and the power-to-weight ratio enable savings of up to 30% in transportation and installation costs, and up to 15% more AC capacity for medium-voltage stations compared to other decentralized conversion solutions available today. This means fewer stations per megawatt (AC) of installed power, with a cumulative saving that can exceed €0.02/W in a 100 MW system.
The input characteristics of the multi-MPPT inverter have been optimized to take full advantage of the benefits of high-power crystalline modules with 182mm and 210mm cells, allowing for additional cost savings at the level of the system ranging from €0.05 to €0.09/W compared to systems designed with conventional modules based on 166x166mm cells.
For centralized system configurations, which currently represent almost 40% of the market, Fimer launched the PVS-260/PVS-300, a completely modular solution designed with a single MPPT configuration.
The company said this solution can easily replace central inverters in more traditional designs, significantly improving performance and reducing BoP costs – optimizing LCOE – achieving a 2.3% reduction in LCOE with a modular conversion configuration, compared to a central solution. It also has higher system availability, over 99.9%, compared to a 99.5% maximum for central solutions; and record power density and power capacity, two times more than any inverter of this kind available on the market, which means fewer drives to install the same MVA capacity.
The manufacturer also explained that the PVS-260/PVS-300 has a large capacity combined with a unique MPPT power pack of super-compact design, which allows developers to maintain a “centralized” system configuration if they prefer. All power electronics are also concentrated close to the other critical AC power elements to simplify control and routine maintenance.
The device is claimed to have lower operating and maintenance costs, which the manufacturer estimates at €0.013/W less than the central solutions for 25 years, thanks to the granularity of the energy conversion achieved with smaller, interchangeable power blocks. Moreover, the combination of six to 24 inverter modules in two units is said to increase the capacity of the 40-foot, medium-voltage compact skid, available in different versions with power between 1,560 kVA and 7,200 kVA.
“By combining the power modules in a factory-tested and pre-assembled medium-voltage station, the new platform can compete with the multi-megawatt utility scale station designs of the latest central inverters, allowing designers to apply the modular configuration to systems of any size,” explained the manufacturer.
“While the shift from central inverters to string inverter technologies in the utility scale sector has increased in the last five years, Fimer recognizes that centralized configurations still prevail.” For this reason, the company added “it has developed the inverters PVS-350 and the PVS-260/PVS-300 modular conversion platforms, to serve both decentralized and centralized applications.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/22/new-microinverter-from-the-us/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 22, 2021",New microinverter from the US,"US storage system manufacturer Yotta Energy has unveiled a new dual-power micro-inverter for applications in rooftop PV.
The device, which the manufacturer describes as an ideal solution for commercial rooftop PV systems linked to between 500 kWh and 1 MWh of storage, can be used without a battery or together with the manufacturer’s SolarLEAF energy storage technology, which can also be mounted under rooftop solar modules.
“The Yotta Dual-Power Inverter (DPI) is designed to work with solar PV installations today,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “A building owner then has the option to install Yotta's commercial energy storage solution at a later date.”
The micro-inverter incorporates rapid shutdown and is able to operate at completely low voltage. It is available as a single-phase device (208 V) and three-phase one (240 V) and can be used with modules with a 60 and 72-cell design and a power output of up to 500 W. Each micro-inverter can accommodate up to four PV modules with an output of 440W each.
The inverter measures 281 x 231 x 41.3 mm, weighs 4.5 kg, and has a cooling system based on natural convection. It has a peak efficiency of 96.5% and a nominal maximum power point tracking (MPPT) efficiency of 99.5%. The MPPT voltage range is between 22 and 48 V and the maximum input voltage 60 V. Maximum continuous output power for the three-phase device is 1.2 kW and 1.1 kW for the single-phase product.
The product comes with a 10-year warranty that is extendable to 25 years, the manufacturer stated.
The inverters are manufactured in Taiwan for Yotta Energy with a strategic original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partnership with Seattle-based micro-inverter technology company APsystems. “Yotta Energy can currently supply 10 MW of inverters for the growing commercial and industrial (C&I) market,” the spokesperson explained. “Production will be increased in 2022.”
The new product is currently sold directly to customers in the US market. The manufacturer is actively looking to expand into international markets, including Europe, by Q1 2022.

Following the satisfactory completion of the winter evaluation, the two companies will negotiate the deployment of GenCell A5 units at 112 active emergency communication sites across Iceland,” reads the note released on Monday.
Representatives of Italian utility Enel and Russian innovation development agency Rusnano have discussed collaboration opportunities to create Russia’s first green hydrogen production project at a wind farm in the Murmansk region. “The joint project with Rusnano will be our first step in starting to explore this promising area in various parts of Russia,” said Simone Mori, the head of Enel’s Europe division. The two companies had signed a memorandum of understanding to look into the option to produce hydrogen at Enel Russia’s Kola Wind Power Plant (capacity: 201 MW), which is being constructed in the Murmansk region. According to Rusnano, it will be the largest wind farm in the Russian Arctic, and will be able to generate 750 GWh of electricity per year. “Russia has a huge potential, both as a producer and as a consumer of green hydrogen … The successful implementation of this joint project with Enel will prove that there is a real demand for the production of green hydrogen, and enable us to scale up the project in the future, thus contributing to the development of Russia’s national hydrogen strategy,” said Sergey Kulikov, chairman of the executive board of Rusnano. The meeting happened during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum earlier this month.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) presented, last week, the country's “green growth strategy,” aiming to accelerate the energy transition and achieve carbon neutrality in 2050. “Pursue hydrogen as an option to the maximum possible extent. Increase supply and demand, improve infrastructure, and reduce costs. Create a hydrogen industry and fuel ammonia industry,” reads the strategy to 2050 published by Japan’s trade and industry ministry. Japan wants to become the leader in the growing ‘green-steel' market. METI plans to subsidize technology innovation in steelmaking processes using part of a ¥2 trillion (€15.2 billion) government fund meant to support green innovation in the next 10 years. The Japanese government and national companies are looking into carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies, indicating that the country could give priority to blue hydrogen. On Tuesday, for instance, Tokyo-based general trading company Itochu said it is joining the Geological Carbon Dioxide Storage Technology Research Association, to participate in a project to research and develop technologies for the underground sequestration of carbon dioxide. On Tuesday, Hiroshi Kajiyama, Japan’s minister of economy, attended the first Asia CCUS Network Forum and announced the launch of the “Asia CCUS Network.”
The Colombian Congress has approved the Energy Transition Law. The law, which now only requires the president’s signature, recognizes green and blue hydrogen as non-conventional sources of renewable energy. This means that the technologies behind these two types of hydrogen will be eligible for the tax benefits of Law 1715: Income deduction, VAT exclusion, zero tariffs, and accelerated depreciation. Regarding sustainable mobility, the text of the law suggests that the national government will adopt programs to promote the use of hydrogen and gas fuel in land transportation, for both goods and passengers.
California-based developer NewHydrogen signed an agreement to further expand the existing sponsored research agreement with the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) to develop technology to reduce the cost of green hydrogen production. “With an increased budget, the new agreement expands the scope of the non-precious-metal-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst development program,” reads the note released on Tuesday. The UCLA researchers came up with a non-precious-metal-based catalyst that “demonstrated significant improvement of OER in acidic conditions by substituting part of the existing metal element in the aforementioned catalyst material structure.” NewHydrogen sees, in the catalyst’s low cost and high durability, two good reasons to use the non-precious-metal instead of platinum.
Australia’s federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, has rejected the latest plans proposed for the 26 GW, AU$50-billion (€31.6 billion) Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) in Western Australia. The project, possibly the largest green energy and hydrogen endeavor in the world, was granted major project status by the Commonwealth government last year. The reversal of fortune is due to the AREH’s alleged impacts on wetlands near Eighty Mile Beach, which are designated as having international significance under the 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. AREH consortium members include green hydrogen developers Intercontinental Energy, renewable energy developer CWP Global, wind-turbine system manufacturer Vestas, indigenous people the Nyangumarta, and the Australian National University’s Energy Change Institute. “We will take concerns on board as we continue to work on the detailed design and engineering aspects of the project,” the group said. According to the original timeline, green hydrogen exports should start in 2027/2028.
Nel Hydrogen Electrolyser, a division of Norway-based hydrogen company Nel ASA, has entered into a collaboration for a fossil-free hydrogen facility in Hofors, Sweden, together with partners Ovako, Volvo, Hitachi ABB, and H2 Green Steel. “We are very excited to enter into this shared initiative to jointly develop fossil-free alternatives for the steel industry. Green hydrogen has the characteristics to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from steel rolling and milling, and this will be the first project in the world to heat steel with hydrogen prior to rolling,” Jon André Løkke, Nel’s CEO, commented in a note released on Tuesday. According to Nel, the conversion to hydrogen will enable reduction of CO2 emissions for steel production in Hofors by 50%, with additional positive externalities. “The plant can be used flexibly and can therefore support the stability of the electrical grid, which in turn will permit more use of renewable energy sources. Additionally, it will be a step in the direction of developing a hydrogen infrastructure for the transportation sector, with locally produced fossil-free hydrogen for fuel cell vehicle trucks.”

Construction on the two facilities, which are Quebec's first operational PV plants, had started in the summer of 2019.
The plants have capacities of 7.5 MW and 2.5 MW and are planned to help Hydro-Quebec determine whether solar energy is well suited to Quebec's climate, to its generation fleet, and to its transmission network. The power provider will also examine the relevance of this energy source in this predominantly hydroelectric territory and compare the performance of different technologies.
The 2.5 MW plant is located in Varennes, an off-island suburb of Montreal, in southwestern Quebec, and comprises 4,620 monofacial and bifacial panels, installed both on fixed structures and single-axis trackers.
The 7.5 MW facility is located in La Prairie, an off-island suburb of Montreal, and is equipped with 25,740 bifacial panels – including 4,316 products manufactured in Quebec – that are installed on fixed structures.
“We are pleased that Quebec is making its entry into solar energy production by taking advantage of local expertise, both for the construction of power plants, with the Borea, and for the acquisition of part panels, with the company Stace,” said Jonatan Julien, Quebec's minister of energy and natural resources.
Under the 2030 energy policy, Quebec’s government is targeting a 40% reduction in the amount of petroleum products consumed; to eliminate the use of thermal coal; to increase, by 25%, the share of renewable energy in total energy production; and to increase bioenergy production by 50%.

A statement issued by German public body the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems today, said new renewables projects “are on the same level with the operating costs of conventional power plants, if not lower.” With forecasters predicting carbon emission certificates will cost more than €100 per ton by the end of the decade, and PV power prices set to fall further, the writing could be on the wall for conventional generation in Germany.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
The conclusions have been presented in the latest, fifth edition of a study of LCOE prices which updated the previous iteration – published in 2018 – by including the impact of battery storage on electricity and renewables project costs.
The researchers said new conventional power stations in Germany would be unable to generate electricity any cheaper than €0.075/kWh and offered 2021 ranges of around €0.08-0.13 for combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT), €0.10-0.15 for lignite facilities, €0.11-0.20 for hard coal, and €0.11-0.29 for non-CCGT gas-fired power.
Those prices compared to €0.03-0.06/kWh for ground-mounted solar in Germany this year, rising to €0.05-0.10 with the addition of battery storage; the same, 5-10 cent level for large PV rooftops, with €0.065-0.14 when a battery is included; and €0.06-0.11 for residential solar, with a 2-9 cent premium if storage is added.
Today, large scale PV offers an LCOE of €0.0312-0.1101/kWh in Germany, according to the researchers, for a project cost of €530-1,600 per kilowatt-peak of generation capacity. The wide range of battery prices means the average costs of a hybrid system range between €0.0524 and €0.1972, the document stated.
Based on the expected learning curve for solar  – the amount of price reduction anticipated from each doubling of generation capacity – the Fraunhofer ISE academics said the LCOE of solar by 2024 would be less than €0.10/kWh, excluding battery costs. On that basis, even solar-plus-storage projects would be cheaper than combined cycle gas plants by the end of the decade, and residential PV and storage, for around €0.05-0.12/kWh, would fall into the same bracket by 2040.
By that point, the researchers said, the price of solar and wind powered electricity will be “significantly lower” than that offered by fossil fuels, with ground-mounted PV offering an LCOE of €0.0192-0.0351 and a project cost of around €350 per kilowatt, and residential solar offering respective figures of €0.0358-0.0677/kWh and €615-985/kW.

Senator Jon Ossoff (D-Georgia) introduced a bill, dubbed the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, which looks to establish a tax credit for domestic solar manufacturers.
According to the senator’s office, the act would boost the U.S. solar supply chain to create American clean energy jobs, compete with offshore manufacturers, and support energy independence. The incentive would be available through 2028 with a phase-down taking place the two years following.
Modules would receive a credit of 11 cents, multiplied by the capacity of the module; cells would receive 4 cents, multiplied by the capacity of the cell; wafers would be credited at $12 per square meter; and solar-grade polysilicon would receive a credit of $3 per kilogram.
Ossoff is working with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) to include the proposal into a broader clean energy plan that may be attached to an infrastructure bill later this year. The legislation is co-sponsored by senators Raphael Warnock (D-Georgia), Michael Bennet (D-Colorado), and Debbie Stabenow (D-Michigan).
The bill is supported by Q CELLS America, Hemlock Semiconductors, LG Electronics USA, REC Silicon ASA, Wacker Polysilicon North America, Sunnova Energy International Inc., First Solar, Mission Solar, Leading Edge Equipment Technologies, Auxin Solar, Swift Solar, 1366 Technologies, Silfab Solar, Heliene, and the Ultra Low Carbon Solar Alliance.
If passed, the bill would be a boost to President Joe Biden’s American Jobs Plan, which already has significant renewable energy provisions, including a 10-year extension of tax credits for solar and wind as well as the establishment of other clean energy tax credits along with direct pay of said credits.
The legislation has been met with open arms by the solar industry, with Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), releasing a statement of support: “While the broader U.S. solar industry continues to flourish, America’s solar manufacturing sector has languished,” she said. Now is the time to “seize the promise” of American solar manufacturing.
The statement also included a call to increase the country’s annual domestic production capacity tenfold by 2030. SEIA set a solar-specific target of 50 GW of annual domestic production capacity by 2030. This goal would create American solar manufacturing capacity equal to over 150% of the 19.2 GW of solar deployed in 2020 and would cover “all key elements of a solar energy system,” SEIA said, including polysilicon, ingots and wafers, cells and modules, racking and trackers and inverters.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/22/italy-could-become-vital-hydrogen-hub-between-north-africa-and-europe/,"HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,ITALY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"JUNE 22, 2021",Italy could become vital hydrogen hub between North Africa and Europe,"Italy should focus on large-scale hydrogen projects and increase cooperation with countries in North Africa to use its well-developed gas network and ship hydrogen from the Mediterranean to southern Germany, says Italian hydrogen and fuel cells association H2IT.
“We are asking for a concrete plan for hydrogen and its rapid implementation,” Alberto Dossi, H2IT’s president, told pv magazine. “These plans should not suffer setbacks or reversals due to changes in governments. We want the industry and the operators of the sector to have the confidence to invest in medium-long payback periods, and we want the hydrogen sector to contribute to achieving the environmental objectives.”
The association, which was founded in 2005, sees in the revision of the EU Renewable Energy Directive and more generally in the Fit-for-55 package (to be presented by the European Commission in early July) a major development for hydrogen in Europe.
“All these measures involve the hydrogen energy sector and will be key to its development, such as the revision of the Renewable Energy Directive, with the presentation of a new RED 3 directive,” Dossi said. “Equally important the revision of the DAFI directive on alternative fuel infrastructure, with more stringent obligations on the construction of refueling stations. Italy must be able to transpose these regulations and implement them concretely. Otherwise, we risk losing the game of sustainability and competitiveness.”
The Italian government aims to install 5 GW of electrolyzers by 2030. The EU strategy foresees 46 GW by 2030.
Italy has also been working on the development of Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) projects. Companies started their engagement in 2019 when the government opened the expressions of interest to participate in the Hydrogen IPCEI. “To date, we are in the selection phase of the group of companies that will participate in the first round of the Hydrogen IPCEI.” Projects will be selected on the basis of their development stage and location.
Hydrogen is mentioned in the recent National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), with €3.64 billion of dedicated investments.
“We believe it is essential to unblock the installation of renewable energy in Italy, simplifying the authorization procedures,” Luigi Crema, H2IT’s vice president, told pv magazine. “Renewable electricity prices continue to decrease; in a few years, green hydrogen could be cheaper than oil or natural gas. One thing in Italy's favor is that it is now possible to build large-scale PV plants without subsidies. We now need to speed up the processes of authorization.”
According to Crema, the goal is to build large-scale electrolyzers of more than 100 MW capacity to decrease green hydrogen’s price below €2.0/kg.
“Italy must aim to support large-scale national projects that exploit the skills of Italian companies to compete internationally,” said Crema, adding that this goal will require political and regulatory adjustments and revisions, in line with the European directives.
Crema stressed that competition in the green hydrogen sector will be fierce, and the green hydrogen market “will be enormous.”
“Italy has many complementary national assets: it has an extensively developed gas network that can be used immediately and then upgraded at minimal cost to accommodate increasing quantities of hydrogen blended with natural gas. The goal is then to develop pure hydrogen transport. It is clear that this represents a strategic point for Italy, both for the extension of the gas network and for the geographical position in which it is located,” added Crema, explaining that Italy should improve its industrial relations with countries like Tunisia.

The spokesperson said existing Rockefeller Foundation projects in the aforementioned countries would be among the first to benefit, in addition to initiatives in nations with “strong near-term opportunities,” for distributed renewables, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Haiti, and across the Latin America and Caribbean region.
The two non-profits yesterday said a new entity would be created to distribute the $1 billion fund with the aim of bringing reliable electricity to around a billion of the 2.8 billion people in the world estimated to lack such facilities.
With the press release issued to announce the $1 billion fund mentioning “shovel-ready” projects in India, Africa and Latin America, the Rockefeller Foundation representative told pv magazine the partners hope their investment will help trigger up to $20 billion in funding for distributed renewables over the next decade.

This gave manufacturers the chance to create scale, which is crucial for decreasing costs and increasing global accessibility and growth. When the engine of scale starts to run, a point of no return is created as acceptance and adoption grows.
Transitions are often exponential, both in price drops and in growth and acceptance. Remember the transition from horse and carriage to combustion engines, from landline phones to mobiles, from LP records to cassettes to CDs to online streaming, and so on.
From that perspective, it is fascinating to see how the International Energy Agency (IEA) has predicted, for over 10 years, a flat line of solar PV year after year. And although it has since updated its models, it still underestimates growth.
350 GW in 2030?
Last year, the EU presented goals for all member states and a forecast for installed PV capacity to 2030. EU countries were asked to share their expectations and ambitions for the growth of PV (and other renewable energy sources). When these expectations are met, the European solar market will triple. One year down the road, political goals are already underperforming when compared to the market.
The political ambitions and the policies in place per country are presented in the Dutch New Energy Research 2021 EU White Paper, which includes a foreword by Diederik Samsom, head of cabinet for European Commissioner Frans Timmermans, who leads the EU Green Deal.
“The Green Deal in December 2019 represents our vision for a just and sustainable future for everyone. Not just another environmental policy, but an overarching comprehensive investment plan to decarbonize our economy and become fully climate neutral in 2050,” said Samsom. “It is clear that solar PV will play a huge role in this transition. The commission’s own assessment shows an installed capacity of approximately 350 GW in 2030 and more than 1,000 GW in 2050. And I do not exclude the possibility that, yet again, reality will beat predictions.”
I fear, but mostly cheer, that Samsom is right about the possibility that reality will beat predictions. The EU predictions start in 2020, and for many countries we can already validate the political underestimation.
Underestimated growth
The Netherlands has been performing exceptionally well for a small country, showing annual double-digit growth numbers for a decade, except for 2014. The Netherlands has a successful residential, C&I, and utility market of more than 10 GW. In the Dutch government’s national climate and energy plan, the market was estimated to grow by 1.8 GW per year over the next decade. However, closer to 3 GW of new capacity was already installed in 2020, off by 67%. This shows the difficulty in assessing the enormous potential of the PV market, and not just in the Netherlands.
Other countries are struggling to value PV development for its true potential as well. For example, this has been the case in two other large markets in the EU, where ambitions for 2020 were outpaced by actual developments: Germany and Spain.
In Spain, the national tally was almost 4 GW installed in 2019, and then 3.2 GW in 2020. The market, in reality, shrunk by 19% compared to the year before. Yet the government estimated a decrease of the market by 47%, making the miss smaller than what was realized.
Similarly, Germany installed 4.88 GW in 2020, a growth rate of 24% compared to 2019, when 3.9 GW was installed. Meanwhile, the German federal government forecast a conservative 2.7 GW, which would have been a decrease of 29% from the previous year. In total, German estimates were off by 74%.
Fearless PV predictions
As shown by these three countries, market statistics and forecasts based on climate ambitions by governments remain a challenge. Especially in the midst of a tremendous energy transition, when markets are still, for the short term, influenced by changing policies. Having governments speak out for a stable long-term investment climate is crucial. A highly ambitious Green Deal on one side and unrealistic conservative estimates on the other lay bare the poor connection of politics with the market. And this unnecessarily undermines the transition.
Within two years of submission, the 10-year EU estimates have already proven to be outdated. Underestimation is central in transitions. Even with the urgency of the energy transition, seeing such estimates this far off remains astounding.
The EU projected a threefold increase for the PV market over the next 10 years. Taking both the context of Covid-19 and the historical gross underestimation of transitions, I predict tenfold growth of the EU PV market to be more realistic.

Perth-based TNG Limited (TNG) has signed an agreement with Malaysian green hydrogen company AGV Energy Technology (AGV) to collaborate on the integration of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) into AGV’s green hydrogen production.
The green hydrogen project, HySustain, uses electrolysis of demineralized water and solar energy. AGV’s intention behind HySustain is to use project-specific solar farms to provide 100% of the renewable resources needed for green hydrogen production. In turn, the VRFB will enable large, scalable and long-life energy storage.
TNG’s managing director and CEO, Paul Burton, said that the company is very “pleased to have secured this Heads of Agreement with AGV Energy, opening up an exciting pathway to collaborate with them on the development of their exciting green hydrogen HySustain technology.”
Burton said that HySustain is a “great opportunity to showcase an integrated VRFB storage solution. We also intend to work with AGV Energy on the potential rollout of HySustain in Australia, given the significant momentum within Australia and the resources industry to move towards a hydrogen-based economy.”
Through an already incorporated joint venture with Singaporean-based battery technology and development company, V-Flow Tech (V-Flow), TNG is also looking to develop its VRFB business throughout regional Australia.

Engineers at Rice University created what they said are 2D perovskite crystals with stable and efficient energy harvesting capabilities, grown from seeds.  
Halide perovskites are organic materials made from abundant and inexpensive ingredients. Rice’s new seeded growth method addresses some performance- and production-related challenges faced by perovskite photovoltaic technologies, said the researchers.  
The process has allowed the engineers to make homogenous thin films comprised of uniformly thick layers. The engineers said that in laboratory testing, photovoltaic devices made from the films proved both efficient and reliable, two metrics that previously came as a challenge for both 2D and 3D perovskite applications. 
Study authors have claimed state-of-the-art efficiency of 17%, before optimization. The engineers at Rice said they are confident that efficiency can be improved. Their work was published online in Advanced Materials.
The seed-grown photovoltaic films were reported to have preserved more than 97% of their peak efficiency after 800 hours under illumination with no thermal management. Historically, 3D halide perovskite PV devices have been efficient but prone to rapid degradation, and 2D devices have been inefficient but long-lasting. 
In the seeded-growth method, seeds are made by slow-growing a uniform 2D crystal and grinding it into a powder, which was then dissolved into a solvent. The seeds retained the same ratio of ingredients as the traditional recipe, and the solvent is then spin-coated onto discs, identical to the original pervoskite-yielding method. The evaporation and crystallization steps mimic the original process. The seeded solution yields films with a homogeneous, uniform surface, similar to the material from which the seeds are ground. 
Seeded growth has often been demonstrated for inorganic crystals, but the researchers said this is the first time it’s been shown in organic 2D perovskites. The process is an often attempted but rarely realized goal in nanomaterials: a self-assembly method to make macroscopic materials that live up to the promise of the individual nanoparticles of which they are composed. 
The researchers said they are hopeful this process can be replicated for other applications in nanomaterials.
