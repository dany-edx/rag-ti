https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/05/italian-council-of-state-clarifies-rules-for-agrivoltaics/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,LEGAL,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2023",Italian Council of State clarifies rules for agrivoltaics,"From pv magazine Italy
Italy's Council of State has issued two different rulings stating that agrivoltaic projects cannot be treated in the same way as conventional ground-mounted PV plants.
A lawyer who followed the matter, Andrea Sticchi Damiani, told pv magazine Italy that these are only the first two rulings, with more to follow.
“The administrative justice has filled the last gaps, so the legislative framework for agrivoltaics is now completely clear,” he said. “The two sentences outline a substantially different regulatory framework for agrivoltaics and traditional photovoltaics.”
The two rulings relate to two projects located in the Italian province of Brindisi, with capacities of 6 MW and 110 MW. The province is in the region of Apulia, which is has one of the highest rates of installed PV capacity in Italy, due to its high solar radiation levels and land availability.
The development of large-scale PV plants was particularly strong in the 2009-14 period, when generous feed-in tariffs were awarded under the so-called Conto Energia incentive programs, on top of favorable rules for approval processes and environmental permits that were in place. 
“The criteria that were used previously, such as the consumption of the territory with respect to the normal agricultural purpose, is an objection that can no longer be raised,” Sticchi Damiani explained. “They are not hectares taken away from agricultural areas, on the contrary, they are often formerly unproductive areas that become productive again.”
He said expects the trend to continue in the months ahead. Prior to the latest rulings of the Council of State, the regional administrative court of Apulia had already decided favorably with regard to the two agrivoltaic projects. These decisions were then challenged by the provincial government, which led to final decisions from the Council of State.
Sticchi Damiani said that the two rulings relate to two projects that were submitted for review before the Italian government issued new guidelines for agrivoltaics.
“With the new guidelines, we now have three types of agrivoltaics: basic non-incentivized agrivoltaic projects, facilities relying on advanced technology that allows access to incentives granted by the Italian energy agency GSE, an even more advanced one that can give access to the rebates provided for by the country's National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR),” he said, noting that the guidelines and the two rulings clarify the authorization process for agrivoltaics. “These rulings affect everything that was carried out before the guidelines.”
The PNRR has allocated €2.6 billion ($2.8 billion) for solar, with €1.1 billion assigned to agrivoltaics and €1.5 billion to PV systems on agricultural rooftops.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/05/what-can-western-utilities-learn-from-emerging-market-peers/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MICROGRID,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2023",What can Western utilities learn from emerging-market peers?,"When planning for change in the decades ahead, Western utility companies could learn much from the experience of competitors active in emerging markets, as well as from business units of their own based in such regions. While it is intuitive to think corporates in the world’s most advanced economies will always have first-mover advantage, and be able to rely on the latest technology, such assumptions may ultimately lead to them falling behind their developing-world peers.
There are several reasons why Western companies cannot afford to be complacent. Firstly, developed markets can be prone to sticking rigidly with longstanding infrastructure which is typically complex and expensive to change. As a result, modest improvements and updates are likely to be preferred over wholesale change and the introduction of new systems.
The rollout of new infrastructure may also face democratic and bureaucratic resistance, as well as regulatory inertia – even if it offers obvious gains. For example, the resistance to building new railways is entrenched in Britain and almost impossible to overcome, with costs spiralling out of control, as England’s beleaguered HS2 high-speed rail project is demonstrating. Such opposition is present despite  the fact the country's economy was historically revolutionized towards the building of large-scale railways.
Developed markets may also carry a bureaucratic burden that discourages business model evolution. By contrast, less-regulated emerging markets can foster flexible and dynamic business models, adaptable to regulatory change and market disruption. That is why disruptive technology and new approaches tend to have the best chance of getting off the ground in emerging markets.
While technology is often developed in the Western engineering labs of academia or industry, emerging-market utilities face fewer bureaucratic obstacles to adoption, which means it is easier to carry out large-scale testing and faster to learn the necessary lessons.
This flexibility has enabled emerging markets to leapfrog traditional utility models in some instances. The adoption of microgrids and off-grid renewable energy plants in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, demonstrates the efficiency of decentralized power generation. Flexibility encourages the rapid proliferation of new systems and methods, whereas this would be inhibited in developed markets by the large-scale investment required to change legacy infrastructure.
Another advantage of emerging markets is the widespread adoption of internet and smartphone technology. In the context of utilities, this means emerging markets can generally offer the necessary networks for monitoring energy usage, making payments, and implementing real-time communication with utility providers. This offers lessons in business operation and, crucially, consumer engagement.
It is no surprise that renewable energy technology’s increasing affordability in emerging markets is fuelling a “prosumer” trend – with people not just consuming energy but also producing it, and selling any surplus back to the grid.
Utilities in emerging markets have shown the effectiveness of incentive programs such as demand-response and time-of-use tariffs with their use in incentivizing prosumer participation, balancing the grid load, and promoting energy efficiency.
Smart appliances with artificial intelligence capability are hugely exciting, as models learn and adapt to consumption habits in markets across the world, from Egypt and Brazil to the Philippines, then respond to price signals. These smart grids allow for two-way communication between utilities and consumers, enabling a dynamic, interactive energy ecosystem and better grid management.
In such fragmented and diverse markets, the need for interoperability is very clear. At Pylon, we have developed a hardware-agnostic infrastructure management platform which can integrate as many as 26 different metering models and enable utility companies to monitor usage, detect losses, and improve revenue in real time.
This approach demonstrates how emerging market utilities can leapfrog well-established competitors, providing a blueprint for the future. Similar lessons, regarding subscription models to supply affordable metering infrastructure, could be useful for Western utilities, particularly as high inflation makes consumers in developed markets acutely aware of costs.
For Western utilities, emerging market innovation should provide insight into the changes needed to work in unfamiliar conditions, as well as the opportunities and limits offered by smart grids. Both can ensure further development is adjusted, to make adoption in developed markets as seamless as possible.
The lesson is that distributed-generation, coupled with energy storage, can provide reliable, sustainable power, even in remote locations. It is a necessary example for many markets, particularly given the execution challenges of widespread renewable power installation.
Likewise, utility companies can play a crucial role in enabling and managing virtual power plants. These offer services similar to traditional power plants but with greater flexibility and lower environmental impact.
It is said that necessity is the mother of invention and this is particularly true for utilities in emerging markets. Time after time, these companies develop and apply new, technology-based solutions in often inhospitable environments. Their successes and setbacks could offer vital lessons for Western utilities over the coming years.

The assessment, which is the first-of-its-kind for Southeast Asia, included 88 reservoirs, including hydropower and non-hydropower facilities, and 7,213 natural waterbodies in the final dataset.
The group found that the FPV technical potential for the region ranges from 134–278 GW on reservoirs and 343–768 GW on natural waterbodies. When waterbody types are taken into consideration, the technical potential for FPV is higher on reservoirs in Laos and Malaysia, while natural waterbodies hold the greater potential in Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. The potential is equivalent across waterbody types in Vietnam.
“Our results show that the average net capacity factor, which accounts for inverter losses, does not change significantly between the waterbody types and various distance sensitivities for monofacial panels (the average net capacity factor varied from 15.6–16.0%),” the researchers said, noting that the average net capacity factor increases by a factor of 1.05 with the use of bifacial fixed tilt panels, based on previous analyses.
NREL’s team used a high-level geospatial assessment methodology to develop a total of four technical potential scenarios based on two different FPV types – monofacial and bifacial – and two waterbody types – reservoirs and natural waterbodies. The study builds off previous research by including non-hydropower reservoirs, inland natural waterbodies, and bifacial PV panels. In addition, the group uses high temporal and spatial resolution solar irradiance data that was not available for previous technical potential assessments.
“Overall, the modeled technical potential for FPV on natural waterbodies is higher than that of reservoirs. However, the actual developable capacity on natural waterbodies might be significantly lower due to site-specific constraints and environmental impact considerations,” the academics explained, adding that waterbodies that are more than 50 km from major roads and those within protected areas were excluded from the analysis.
Thailand had the top potential for FPV on reservoirs, with 576 suitable waterbodies, a capacity of 57,645 MW, and generation of 83,781 GWh/Year. The top potential for FPV on natural waterbodies was found in Indonesia, which has 2,719 suitable waterbodies, 271,897 MW of capacity, and 369,059 GWh/year of generation.
“Overall, these findings indicate significant technical potential for FPV in each country and across the region,” the researchers said. “Several countries have ambitious renewable energy targets, mainly focused on solar, hydropower, and wind deployment. FPV presents an additional RE option that can leverage existing infrastructure, especially existing hydropower capacity, and support ongoing and increasingly ambitious decarbonization efforts in the region.”
Their findings are available in the report “Enabling Floating Solar Photovoltaic (FPV) Deployment: FPV Technical Potential Assessment for Southeast Asia,” published on NREL’s website. The study is claimed to “help policymakers and planners better understand the role that FPV could play in meeting regional energy demand and could ultimately help inform investment decisions.”
“Detailed market and economic technical potential assessments will be needed to further assess the FPV opportunities in each country. For specific sites, detailed site-specific analysis will need to be conducted given the lack of bathymetry, wind, wave, and sediment data at a regional level,” the scientists concluded.

The NUJC420B double-glass module features 108 half-cut solar cells based on M10 wafers and a 16-busbar design.
The new panels measure 1,722 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh 20.7 kg. They can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,000 V and an operating temperature between -40 C and 85 C.
The IEC61215- and IEC61730-certified panel also features a power conversion efficiency of 21.51% and an operating temperature coefficient is -0.30% per degree Celsius.
The company offers a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee. The 25-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 85% of the nominal output power.
“The use of round conductors in the 16-busbar system enhances power gain for each cell and reduces vulnerability to microcracks, which improves module reliability,” the manufacturer said. “The half-cell module has three small junction boxes, each equipped with a single bypass diode. This design reduces heat transfer to the cells above, thus increasing module longevity and overall system performance.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/05/heat-pumps-design-to-reduce-footprint-of-solar-thermal-installations-2/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HEAT PUMPS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MEXICO",LIOR KAHANA,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2023",Heat pump design to reduce footprint of solar thermal installations,"A group of scientists led by the University of Guanajuato in Mexico has developed a new methodology to reduce the area needed for the deployment of solar thermal systems installations (STIs) by linking them with heat pumps.
The proposed system consists of a solar collector network, a storage system, and two heat pumps assisted by the solar collectors themselves.
In the paper “Heat and electric power production using heat pumps assisted with solar thermal energy for industrial applications,” published in Energy, the research group, which also includes academics from Texas A & M University in the United States, said that they considered irradiance conditions, the target temperature, and the operation time to design the solar collector network.
“The target temperature of the network is the temperature of the heat pump evaporator, and the target temperature of the heat pump is the process temperature,” they explained, noting that the collector will provide the heat load required by the evaporator, at the evaporation temperature. “The heat pump refrigerant, through isentropic work, will raise the temperature and pressure to supply the heat load at the process target temperature.”
The proposed approach was simulated for a sugar mill that also produces bioethanol and electricity from sugarcane bagasse. The scientists considered two solar-assisted heat pumps to supply the heat and the power of the second generation (2G) bioethanol production process.
For electrical production, the scientists modeled a system that uses thermal energy to heat water, which is then heated by the heap pump evaporator. Then, using R600a as the working fluid of the heat pump, the heat is utilized for an organic Rankine cycle to create electricity.
As for heat production, the system uses thermal energy to heat the evaporator of the heat pump, and the heat produced by the pump is then used in the production process of second-generation bioethanol.
Through their analysis, the researchers found that the heat pumps helped reduce the area needed for the STIs by 85%. “A reduction of 2885 m2 was achieved in the absorber area of the solar collector network to produce heat,” they specified. “The reduction in absorber area to produce power was of 586,918 m2.”
The simulated system was also able to produce power at a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of $0.3435/kWh compared with that of fossil fuels estimated at $0.761/kWh. As for heat, the system was able to achieve $0.1257/kWh compared to $0.124/kWh for fossil fuels.
“The process is feasible, because costs to produce process heat are significantly reduced by 20–30% considering the cost of the heat pump; the simple payback time is 6.5–12.3 years,” the US-Mexican group noted.

“KGeCl3 is one of the compounds that can be produced in the laboratory and has not been discovered in nature until now,” the research's corresponding author, Mohammed ElSaid Sarhani, told pv magazine.
In the study “AB-INITIO study of electronic, mechanical, optical and thermoelectric properties of KGeCl3 for photovoltaic application,” published in Heliyon, Sarhani and his colleagues used the WIEN2k software to analyze the electronic, elastic, optical, and thermoelectric characteristics of the KGeCl3 perovskite across its cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic phases.
The software allows users to perform electronic structure calculations of solids using density functional theory (DFT), which is a quantum-mechanical atomistic simulation approach to analyze a wide variety of properties of almost any kind of atomic system, including molecules, crystals, surfaces, and electronic devices.
“DFT is particularly well-suited for large systems, making it valuable for studying complex molecules,” the scientists stressed, noting that they also used the Boltzmann transport theory to assess the thermoelectric properties of the perovskite material. The Boltzmann approach enables the description of electron transport in materials with a complex band structure.
Through their analysis, the academics found that the KGeCl3 perovskite has stable structures in all three configurations and “good” elastic properties.
“According to the electronic band structure calculation, KGeCl3 perovskite is a direct bandgap semiconductor with bandgap energies of 0.92 eV, 1.26 eV, and 1.88 eV for cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic phases, respectively,” they also stated. “This implies that the material could be used in optoelectronic applications including photovoltaic devices.”
Sarhani also explained that the novel material is not the cheapest, as it contains germanium. “But the cost of producing this type of material is cheaper than other materials, thanks to the ease and conditions of its manufacture,” he emphasized. “It does not require high pressures or a high degree of purity. In addition, its production protocol is easy and simple.”
The scientists concluded by saying that KGeCl3 perovskite may be used for lead-based perovskite materials in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices. “Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of KGeCl3 perovskite as a multifunctional material with promising structural, electronic, optic, and thermoelectric properties across different crystal structures,” they said.

The TIS approach is used to investigate new technological fields and industries in and beyond the context of sustainability transitions. It seeks to understand the dynamics of an innovation ecosystem surrounding d a specific technology and is often used to identify shortcomings and define recommendations for the design of policies in support of a specific technology.
“This Guide for Technological Innovation System (TIS) Analysis BIPV offers hands-on support on theory and methods for those who want to analyze the innovation system for BIPV in their country,” the organization said. “This document can also be used as a template for a final TIS-analysis report – using the same (sub-)chapters, tables, and graphs.”
The handbook presents the rating of the performance of eight functions of the TIS related to BIPV, on a scale of one to five. The functions mentioned are knowledge development, knowledge dissemination, entrepreneurial experimentation, resource mobilization, development of social capital, legitimation, guidance of the search and market formation.
The authors of the report also provided indicators and assessment questions to better produce a well-argued paper. In addition, the report assists the users with setting country-wide targets for the development of BIPV, and also helps them formulate recommendations for overcoming issues, targeting both policymakers and industry actors.
“For those functions that are not fulfilling the target requirements, guidance is given on how to identify systemic problems that either relate to actors, institutions, interaction between actors, or infrastructural deficits,” the report notes.
The report also offers guidance on how to define BIPV correctly, how to analyze historical and technological information, and how to conduct a structural analysis of the specific target country. In addition, it looks at the available technical and knowledge solutions in the relevant market, from early concept development to a fully mature market.

To date, Western Australia has been the main focus of lithium exploration in Australia, but recent research indicates that other regions also hold significant potential.
Researchers from the University of Sydney, with support from Geoscience Australia, have led a study that indicates elevated predicted lithium densities in soils across the central western region of Queensland, southern New South Wales, and parts of Victoria.
“We’ve developed the first map of lithium in Australian soils which identifies areas with elevated concentrations,” said the study’s senior author, Professor Budiman Minasny. He claimed that the findings could have significant implications for the lithium industry in Australia.
The team used digital soil mapping techniques developed at the University of Sydney to gauge extractable lithium content present in soil samples collected across Australia. While the highest lithium concentrations were found near the Mount Marion deposit of Western Australia , the study suggests potential lithium sources in Australia spread well beyond this region.
“The map agrees with existing mines and highlights areas that can be potential future lithium sources,” said Minasny.
The research aimed to paint a comprehensive overview of lithium distribution across Australia. The study was published in Earth System Science Data.
