Adelaide-based Tindo Solar has today launched its first panel aimed at the utility-scale segment. Ahead of its product listing with the Clean Energy Council, the 545W Karra module was evaluated by TUV SUD Korea which found the panel actually generated 5 watts more than its rating.
Specifically, the engineers at TUV found Tindo’s utility-scale panel produced 549W of power at around 21% module efficiency and 23.1% cell efficiency, recording a 0.07% cell-to-module (CTM) loss. The industry average energy efficiency of a solar module is between 17 and 19%, and the average CTM loss is 2-3%, Tindo noted.
The testing, Tindo said, found its 545W Karra module “one of the most efficient panels available in the world.”
The 545W panel is considerably larger than Tindo’s largest residential rooftop module, the 410W Karra, and is specifically designed to be used in utility-scale arrays, either on a rooftop or ground-mounted applications. It is 2283mm x 1149mm in size, weighs 29kg and includes a 25-year limited product warranty.
The panel was designed to coincide with its new production line in South Australia that uses the latest global standard for solar cells, the M10, Tindo said, adding that the new product will be available in commercial qualities from March 2022. “Over the next decade there will be a steeper increase in demand for panels in large-scale projects than from our core market of rooftop retail and commercial,” Tindo Solar Chief Executive Officer, Shayne Jaenisch, said.
Jaenisch added the typical utility-scale panel used in Australia is imported and doesn’t require a Clean Energy Council (CEC) listing. Jaenisch said there was strong interest in Australia-made panels built for utility applications, which reflected concerns about performance but was also linked to waste going to landfills and alleged forced labor in foreign supply chains.

France-based Société du Canal de Provence (SCP) and French energy provider Sergies, have signed a partnership agreement to jointly finance, build and operate four PV systems with a combined capacity of 12MW on the Provence Canal, which is a canal system serving, with water, 110 municipalities in the southern French regions of Bouches-du-Rhône and the Var, including big cities such as Aix-en-Provence, Marseille, and Toulon.
These solar systems are expected to occupy a total canal surface with a length of 5,420m and to generate a total of 19GWh per year. They will be located across the municipalities of Venelles, Rians, and Signes.
The SCP will be in charge of deciding the area to be occupied by the facilities, carrying out the soil studies, and providing anchorage. Sergies, which was selected at the end of 2021, following a tender process, will manage the deployment of the PV installations and the associated electrical equipment.
The choice of the specific project design will be made by considering landscape integration and the technical and economic balance of the photovoltaic installations.
The two companies created a 50/50 special purpose vehicle for the project. Their main goal, in the long term, is bringing their technical solutions closer to commercial viability.
According to their estimations, the Provence Canal has the potential to host around 40MW of PV capacity. A first, 36kW prototype above a section of the canal was built in 2016 in the town of Rians. The main purpose was to study the effects of the water in cooling the photovoltaic panels and the impact of that process on electricity production efficiency.

“TUDelft will support the technology development and upscaling from lab-scale processing to industrial scale,” TU Delft scientist, Arno Smets, told pv magazine, referring to the manufacturer's plan to scale the capacity of its factory in Arnhem to 40 MW. “Current expansion is based on solar foil with a 12.0% conversion efficiency based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) in a tandem cell configuration that has been developed in our collaborations.”
Researchers at TU Delft are currently developing the next generation triple junctions configurations that are expected to bring the module efficiency to over 15.0%. “The unique processing approach of the HyET Solar concept allows innovative device designs, light management concepts and new materials,” Smets added. “In this collaboration, we are using mature processing technologies to secure and demonstrate a fast knowledge transfer from lab to fab.”
The PowerFoil 1300HE that HyET has developed for residential applications has a rated power of 152W/m. It has a width of 1,300mm and a thickness of 0.4mm. Its length can reach up to 15,000mm, depending on the project type and size, and its weight is 0.6kg/m2.
The foil can be used with a maximum system voltage of 500 V and operating temperatures of between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius. Its operating temperature coefficient is -0.30% per degree Celsius.
The panels are manufactured through a roll-to-roll process that the manufacturer says allows up to 30-meter long modules to be produced, while the shape can be adapted to the needs of the end-user. According to HyEt, residential PV systems built with its foils may achieve a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of $0.043/kWh.
Australia-based Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) acquired a 60% stake in HyEt Solar in October. “We have commenced the design study for a 1 GW Powerfoil factory in Australia and at this scale, we aim to rapidly drive costs down at a greater rate than is achievable with conventional Solar PV technology,” FFI CFO, Julie Shuttleworth, said at the time.

The company completed last summer a 250 kW demonstration project, which was supported by a £640,000 grant from UK government funder Innovate UK. In this facility, a tower is powered by renewable energy to raise a mass in a 150-1,500 m shaft and discharges the electricity thus “stored” by releasing the mass to rotate the two power generators. The mass used in larger projects can range from 500 to 5,000 tons.
The technology is claimed to have a faster response time than lithium-ion storage technology and to be able to help stabilize electricity networks at 50 Hz by responding to full power demand in less than a second.
In October, Gravitricity also announced it was considering the deployment of its gravity energy storage system in Czechia, where it would be built at the decommissioned Staříč coal mine in the country's Moravian Silesian region. The mine consists of six deep sites that could potentially host the storage solution.

Thailand’s CK Power (CKP) is set to double in size over the next three years after committing to add 2.8GW of new renewables-based generating capacity, including a ten-fold increase in its solar-based capacity to more than 330MW. 
CKP is one of the region’s largest generators of renewable electricity, and yesterday reported record-high revenues for 2021, driven largely by the sales of electricity from its Nam Mgum 2 Hydroelectric Power Plant. Strong results have led the company to earmark $111 million for renewables investment in 2022. 
CKP aims to invest the bulk of that war chest outside of Thailand and forecasts that within five years the company’s electricity generation will be entirely renewable. 

“There are massive new opportunities arising from the disruptive global shift to renewables-based electricity,” says CKP managing director Thanawat Trisivavet. “Our position as one of the region’s largest renewables-based electricity producers enables us to leverage these emerging opportunities well, and, at the same time, contribute significantly to Thailand’s drive towards decarbonization to tackle global warming.”

“We will increase our installed capacity to be 4,800MW by 2024 through six new electricity generating facilities in Thailand and the region,” continued Trivisvavet. “All of our new installed capacity will be based on renewables, including solar power, hydropower and wind power.”
Along with the ten-fold increase in solar, CKP is also planning to double its wind capacity, ensuring its supply is ready for the projected doubling of energy demand in Southeast Asia over the next 20 years. 
Currently, CKP is currently linked to 29MW of installed solar capacity.

“After eight years of research and around €1 million of private investment in the development of a floating photovoltaic system, SolOcean has now successfully launched a finished system into the water for the first time,” the company said in a statement, noting that the first floating system based on its technology is currently being tested on a quarry pond in Pöchlarn in Lower Austria.
The floating structure was assembled by Austrian company Rehau GmbH with decentrally manufactured components. It measures 2,130 x 1,100 x 300 mm and weighs 48 kg. It can host a PV element with dimensions of 210 x 1,034 x 8 mm and a power of output of up to 445 W, and reach with it a weight of up to 69 kg.
“The floater can host, in principle, any kind of solar module,” the company's CFO, Marcus Ransauer, told pv magazine. “But the special glass surface we developed is necessary to avoid salt furring and furring from bird-dropping. So, the customer buys the whole system at SolOcean, but SolOcean can choose the supplier for the module and the glass. These components are then assembled together in the SolOcean floater.”
The floating structure can be anchored to the seabed with a mooring line and, if used with a solar module with a power output of 445 W, the required area per megawatt would reach 5,995 m2.

The ideal PV element can be a solar module with a power output ranging from 430 to 445 W, which weighs 25 kg and is made with 2 mm tempered glass, hydrophobic coating, and polyolefin foil as an encapsulant. A single module has a buoyancy of 430 kg.
The panel should operate with a maximum system voltage of 1.050 V and operating temperatures of between -40 and 90 degrees Celsius; its operating temperature coefficient is -0.37% per degree Celsius.
The floater comes with a 15-year warranty and is claimed to be suitable for waves up to 3m and currents up to 2m/sec.  According to the manufacturer, it can be used either for onshore and offshore applications, as it was also conceived to be salt-resistant.
“Everything is designed for use under extreme conditions,” it further explained, noting that the hydrophobic coating acts against adhering salt crystals and bird droppings, preventing the adherence of organic substances on the module surface.

The 300m single-row PV system has a capacity of 71.5 kW and will supply power to nearby buildings and parks owned by the municipality and feed excess electricity into the grid under the country's net metering scheme, the so-called Scambio sul posto.
“A photovoltaic system developed in length does not pose any problems with respect to the module strings or the use of modules and inverters — on the contrary, for its maintenance, it makes it easier to check and repair the string in which a yield drop has been detected,” the municipality's architect, Andrea Aquini, told pv magazine. “Even for panel replacement, the operations are significantly simplified compared to a PV system with a more traditional shape.”
The PV installation was built with a tilt angle of 80 degrees and a special mounting system that is also aimed at facilitating maintenance operations without the need for a crane, which was instead used for fixing the galvanized steel support structure to the bridge by chemical tessellation. The mounting structures have the ability to orient each individual panel in a different way, both on the vertical and horizontal axes, which optimizes performance and provides an aesthetically pleasing configuration.

The regional authorities granted the authorization for the project imposing an “accordion” architecture for panels, which were placed at different heights to follow the course of the arches of the bridge, thus avoiding that the positioning of the panels could prevent users who pass on the bridge from enjoying the view towards the south or the view over the old bridge and the visible stretch of the river Pò .
The project was tendered by the municipality in June and required a total investment of around €160,000.
The array was built with 220 full-black solar panels with a power output of 325 W and a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V. It is expected to generate around 74,646 kWh per year.
“Considering all incentives and the sale of excess power to the grid under net metering, the payback time of the project is estimated at around eight years,” Aquini stated.

Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory is leading a research project to profile the concentration of lithium in the geothermal field beneath California’s Salton Sea, and to explore the most environmentally benign way to extract it.
Brine from the geothermal field is already pumped to the surface to generate geothermal power, and recirculated back underground. Lithium could be extracted from brine before it is pumped underground. Eleven geothermal plants are now operating in the Salton Sea, which Berkeley Lab describes as “pilot” operations.
With a back-of-the-envelope calculation, “you can convince yourself” that the geothermal field contains between 1 and 6 million metric tons of lithium, said UC Riverside geochemist Michael McKibben. McKibben is a researcher on the project who has studied the geothermal field since the 1970s.
The Salton Sea geothermal system is “a world-class resource,” agreed lead investigator Pat Dobson with Berkeley Lab. He pointed to several key unknowns: the size of the resource, the rate at which it would decline over time with the extraction of lithium, and whether it would be replenished by the remaining lithium in the host rocks.
The study aims to answer those questions, with a $1.2 million research grant from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Geothermal Technologies Office. The federal government is the largest owner of land under the Salton Sea.
“We need better data on the chemistry of the brines and their lithium content,” said McKibben, “and how it’s distributed in terms of position and depth in the geothermal field.” With that information, combined with existing field data, the research team aims to estimate how much lithium could be in brine in parts of the field that remain untapped, he said.
The researchers have asked geothermal companies operating in the region to share their brine data. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the owner of most of the geothermal plants in the region, has pledged to work with the research team.
Across the U.S., annual production of lithium from geothermal brine could reach 56,000 to 1.5 million metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE), as estimated by Idaho National Laboratory researchers. That compares to global LCE production forecasts of 615,000 metric tons in 2022 and 821,000 metric tons in 2023 prepared by Australia’s Department of Industry.
“We think geothermal lithium is one of the least environmentally impactful ways of obtaining lithium,” said Dobson. The Berkeley Lab study will evaluate how to mitigate “environmental side effects to make it even more benign,” he said.
Almost all the land under the Salton Sea is owned by three entities: the federal government, California’s Imperial Irrigation District, and the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians.
Berkeley Lab will convene a National Energy Storage Summit in March, including a three-hour session on “building out a domestic lithium resource.”
