The lowest bid was made by UAE-based Masdar, which offered a price of $0.018045/kWh for a project that is expected to exceed the tendered capacity and to have an installed power of 457 MW. The second-lowest bid was submitted by Chinese solar developer Jinko Power submitted a price of $0.021621/kWh for 500 MW of capacity.
Furthermore, Saudi Arabian utility ACWA Power offered $0.024825/kWh for 354 MW of capacity and France's Total Eren offered $0.033940/kW for 400 MW. The final price of Chinese module maker Risen, which was also among the shortlisted bidders, has not been revealed.
The Uzbek government had pre-qualified 54 bidders for the tender in March. “The project capacity is a minimum of 200MW,” Olivier Kueny, Senior PPP Specialist at the Asian Development Bank (ADB), told pv magazine. “We innovated on this tender by allowing bidders to optimize their bids by not capping the capacity for them to use fully the 600ha of land available.”
The exercise is being carried out with the support of the ADB. It is part of the 1 GW solar program developed by the government and the lender. Other tenders, for 900 MW of PV capacity are being held with the support of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) private sector arm of the World Bank.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country had an installed solar power generation capacity of only 4 MW at the end of 2020.

French floating PV specialist Ciel & Terre’s India arm has completed construction on a 14.7 MWp floating solar plant in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu. The project was developed for Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation (SPIC) Limited on a water surface located in its Thoothukudi plant.
“It is India’s largest installed floating solar plant as of date,” stated the company, adding that “while there are other projects of a bigger scale started in India, they are yet to reach the completion stage.”
The floating array relies on Ciel & Terre’s proprietary Hydrelio Equato floating platforms, which were manufactured locally. The plant was built with 37,632 solar panels with a power output of 390 W on a surface of 15.6 hectares.
Ciel & Terre India managing director Deepak Ushadevi said, “A captive project like this will benefit the industry from a competitive price compared to the grid, and we can replicate the same model on other industrial reservoirs such as steel, thermal, fertilizers, cement, chemical, etc.”
Over the years, Ciel & Terre has gained vast expertise and substantial experience in the installation of large-scale floating PV plants on artificial and freshwater reservoirs. “Our team has a thorough understanding of floating PV challenges and accordingly assisted our SPIC customer in the realization of the biggest floating plant in this country despite the Covid-19 pandemic challenges,” said Ushadevi. 
Ciel & Terre India commissioned its first pilot 452 KWp project at Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL), Cochin, in 2019. This was followed by a 5.4 MWp at Sagardighi thermal power plant in West Bengal last year. 
Currently, Ciel & Terre India is executing a mega floating project of 75 MWp in South India, which it expects to commission by October this year. The Hydrelio floats for the project are being supplied by Ciel & Terre India’s Kerala factory. 
Ciel & Terre International has also launched a global R&D center in Bangalore for innovative engineering and new product development activities.

Engie Green, a unit of French energy group Engie, has joined forces with the associations France Nature Environnement and Apicluster to implement a beekeeping project at several of its solar parks located in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d´Azur region, in southeastern France.
The project is called “HappySolaire” and is aimed at utilizing the vast, calm, and secure spaces offered by the empty spaces of the solar parks, which Engie Green defined as perfectly suitable to the development of bee colonies.
The project is being led by Apicluster, an association based in Marseille which installs apiaries within companies by promoting beekeeping practices that respect the environment. The project will also have a social component by training and supporting new beekeepers in their professional path.
In 2019, Engie Green installed several beehives at its solar parks La Verdière and Charleval. The principle is that of transhumance, where beekeepers are able to move their hives according to the seasons to obtain specific honey for each flowering. In summer, the beehives can thus be transported to another solar park located in the nearby Valensole plateau to benefit from the lavender. Three other solar parks, in the Var and in the Alpes de Haute-Provence, will also soon welcome beehives. 
In addition, the La Verdière solar park is one of the first to have welcomed sheep on its land. Of the 50 solar parks operated by Engie Green in southern France, 28 sheep pastoralism partnerships have already been set up and 10 more are in the pipeline. “Whether it is beekeeping or pastoralism, our goal is to put this fenced land at the service of the sustainable development of the territory,” said Romain Verron, development manager of Engie Green. “Far from being a sacrificed space, the solar park is valued in many ways to contribute to the realization of virtuous local initiatives.”

A company spokesperson told pv magazine that the plant will produce hydrogen from seawater and will be powered by a 30 MW solar plant and a 20 MWh storage system with an autonomy of 4 hours.
The facility will be based on double-reverse osmosis treatment with energy recovery followed by electrolysis of deionized water through proton exchange membrane (PEM). Furthermore, secondary electrolysis of concentrated brine will be implemented by cell membrane electrolysis.
The main electrolyzer at the facility will have an installed capacity of 20 MW and an estimated production of 1,000 tons per year. The produced fuel will be then stored in trucks for pressurized gas at 400 bar pressure.
Hydrogen will be used as fuel for public transport at the port and urban cleaning vehicles in the city of Almería. It will also be utilized to feed the port's unloading machinery, the national and international transport of goods, and part of the energy demand of local manufacturing industries.
The project has a required investment of €80.5 million euros and is scheduled to be built by the end of 2024. Gransolar confirms that it has the interest and commitment of the Almería City Council, as well as multiple companies from different professional sectors, without providing further details.
Almería will not be the only Andalusian port with plans to produce hydrogen. The Port of Malaga is also expected to host green hydrogen production through a project that also contemplates the use of artificial intelligence.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/19/growing-interest-for-pv-arrays-with-eastern-and-western-orientation-in-germany/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 19, 2021",Growing interest for PV arrays with eastern and western orientation in Germany,"The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE has reported that an increasing number of solar PV rooftop systems installed in Germany in recent years have an east or east/west orientation, or a smaller tilted angle.
In a report, the institute's experts analyzed the trajectory of all PV system typologies deployed in the country over the past two decades. “The share of PV systems with southern orientation decreased from 61% in 2000 to 42% in 2019,” they found. “East orientations increased from 1% in 2000 to 7% in 2019, west orientations from 3% in 2000 to 9% in 2019, and east/west orientations from 1% in 2000 to 6% in 2019.”
According to the study, the share of south-oriented PV systems in 2019 reached 42%, while south-west systems and south-east systems had a share of 19% and 14%, respectively. Furthermore, it revealed west-oriented systems represent 9% of the total and east-oriented 7%, with east-west systems representing the smallest share, at 6%.
The researchers warned that installing solar arrays with orientations other than south may result in power yield losses, the extent of which depends mainly on the inclination angle of the solar modules. “If the tilted angle is optimal, the loss of power can be minimized and is typically between 5-10%,” they said, noting that orientations other than south can help better distribute electricity generation during the day.
The survey further revealed that the share of PV rooftop installations that have a tilted angle lower than 20 degrees has increased from 5% in 2000 to 24% in 2019. “Plants with tilt angles between 20 and 40 degrees accounted for an average share of 63% between 2000 and 2009,” the researchers added. “This share fell to 54% between 2010 and 2019.”
Moreover, they explained that the number of PV systems with a limit to a maximum grid feed-in of 70% of their output power has considerably increased in recent years. This limitation is established by the country's renewable energy law, the so-called EGG, for PV systems that have no remote-controllable feed-in management. “Since 2014, this proportion has grown by an average of 4 percentage points per year,” the report noted. “The remaining plants with output limitations are bound by even higher limitations ranging from 60% to 50% due to the combined battery storage system.”

Matías Kulfas, the Minister of Productive Development of Argentina, and Gerardo Morales, the governor of the northern Argentinian province of Jujuy, signed a memorandum of understanding last week with China's Ganfeng Lithium to build a lithium battery factory. They also agreed to jointly identify future investment opportunities related to lithium extraction.
The agreement focuses on efforts to assess the viability of joint projects related to lithium exploration and sustainable mobility.
“It is a process where all of us who are sitting here are going to win,” said Kulfas.
In March 2016, Chilean non-metallic miner SQM announced the acquisition of a 50% stake in the project from Lithium Americas, in order to extract lithium in the Cauchari-Olaroz salt flats, at the Argentine Exar mine. In 2018, Lithium Americas announced another strategic partnership with Ganfeng Lithium, which bought its stake in the SQM project for $87.5 million.
The project will start production in mid-2022. Once it is operational, it is expected to produce 40,000 tons of battery-grade lithium carbonate per year. Ganfeng Lithium owns a 51% stake in the mine and Lithium Americas holds the remaining 49%.
Jujuy Litio, a company formed by JEMSE (Jujuy Energía y Minería, Sociedad del Estado) and Italy's SERI, currently manufactures lithium batteries in Europe. Two years ago, it announced the construction of the first lithium-ion battery factory in Latin America.
Recently, BMW said that it would acquire more than $300 million of lithium from Argentina.

“The system is designed for lithium-ion storage, as that is the chemistry that presents the greatest risk, and, in particular, for outdoor cabinet-type enclosures where the batteries are accessed from the exterior,” PNNL scientist, Matt Paiss, told pv magazine, noting that it is applicable from 50kW to multi-megawatt cabinets.
According to fellow researcher Allan Tuan the system uses commercially available components and is easy to install on new installations or retrofits. “Cost depends on the size of the battery and an end user or operator can obtain the system for their particular site/facility through a low-cost, fixed-fee license from PNNL,” he told pv magazine.
Dubbed IntelliVent, the sensor system is described as a deflagration-prevention technique that combines automatically controlled door locks with a smart controller that manages signals from fire safety inputs such as smoke, heat, or gas detectors.
The sensor can reportedly detect the toxic flammable gases released by a lithium-ion battery when its liquid electrolyte vaporizes and pushes it to reach critical temperatures. “Depending on the size of the cell, these gases can come out at very high volume, very quickly, and can lead to fire or even an explosion,” Paiss continued.
The system is able to make all cabinet doors open before gas buildup and creates the conditions for a safer incident, while also avoiding the task of opening the doors of a battery under critical situations to O&M workers.
The technology will now be tested by the Arlington Microgrid and Clean Energy Center in Everett, Washington, which will retrofit an existing 1.2 MW battery with the proposed system.

Indian PV developer ReNew Power has revealed that it has selected the state of Gujarat as the location of its new solar cell and module manufacturing facility. 
It will build the factory in the Dholera Special Industrial Region (DSIR), approximately 100 km outside the city of Ahmedabad. The greenfield facility will manufacture 2 GW of solar cells and modules per year, using monocrystalline PERC and large wafer technologies.
The factory will also sell components to other renewable energy companies in India, in addition to serving ReNew Power’s own requirements for its utility-scale power generation business. It is expected to generate 2,500 jobs in the state.
The developer has secured 100 acres of land for the project from the state government, which leaves room for future capacity expansion. The vertically integrated plant is expected to start production in fiscal 2022-23. 
“The manufacturing capacity being set up will incorporate ReNew Power’s sustainability initiatives and ensure decarbonization of manufacturing processes and supply chain to create a ‘green factory’ of the future,” ReNew Power said.
“The Indian government’s production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for solar photovoltaic (PV) modules has opened up several avenues for domestic manufacturing in the renewable energy sector,” said ReNew Power CEO Sumant Sinha. “ReNew plans to manufacture both solar cells and modules in the Dholera manufacturing facility with the goal of creating a globally competitive manufacturing unit.”
The new factory will also help the company to bring critical functions in-house, so it can avoid paying high customs duties on imported components, which are expected to go into force from April 1, 2022.

Although the new storage technology is described as being at a very early stage of development, its creators are convinced that the device has the technical potential to be utilized in multiple applications. “This technology is perfectly suitable for large-scale storage of wind and solar energy,” researcher Luping Tan told pv magazine. “It is also perfect for rooftop PV and our primary idea was to produce roof elements with battery functions for storage of energy from PV.”
The storage system consists of a cement-based mixture in which a commercially available metal-coated carbon fiber (CF) mesh was embedded. Iron (Fe) was used for the anode and nickel-based (Ni) oxides for the cathode. “When CFs are used as additional filler in cement-based materials, they can increase electrical conductivity, decrease drying shrinkage, and increase flexural toughness,” the researchers explained.
The spacing of the meshes was 10 mm by 8 mm with a thickness of 1 mm and an ion exchange resin was added to the mixture of the cement-based electrolyte separator. “The structural battery was constructed as an anode layer, a separator layer, and a cathode layer, where the electrolyte is the cement-based separator,” the Swedish group said.

In the testing phase, the academics used a commercial charger for rechargeable nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries. The charging periods were approximately 12–16 h and the discharging periods around 8–12 h. “The cement-based electrodes with iron powder and nickel hydroxide (Ni (OH)2) powder are rechargeable in liquid electrolytes and can make a small LED lamp shine for several hours,” they stated. adding that its energy density reached just 0.5 Wh/m2.
The same electrodes with a coating of metal Ni and Fe, respectively, reached a maximum energy density of 7 Wh/m2 during six charge/discharge cycles. “The energy density is still low in comparison to commercial batteries, but this limitation could be overcome thanks to the huge volume at which the battery could be constructed when used in buildings,” the scientists said. “We have a vision that in the future this technology could allow for whole sections of multi-storey buildings made of functional concrete.”
A cost assessment of the storage technology was not conducted yet. “At the present stage it is difficult to compare the costs between different approaches,” Tan explained.
The experimental battery was described in the paper Rechargeable Concrete Battery, recently published in the scientific journal Buildings

Electricity generated from large-scale solar has exceeded the average amount generated by gas for the first time in Australia. Simultaneously, rooftop solar has brought traditional periods of peak grid demand during high summer to their lowest levels in five years, shifting national consumption patterns and causing wholesale electricity prices to hit nine-year lows.
The arresting statistics come from the Australian Energy Regulator’s Wholesale Markets Quarterly report for the first three months of this year. The agency’s chair, Claire Savage, described the report as underlining the effect of Australia’s energy transition.
Unlike much of the developed world, Australia’s peak energy draws come from cooling rather than heating, with millions of Australians turning on air conditioners in the middle of hot summer days. With around 20% of Australian households now fitted with PV panels – up from 0.2% in 2007 – the National Electricity Market (NEM) is simply not experiencing the draw it would from this traditional behavior, with one in five Australians bypassing the grid altogether, powering their air conditioners with energy harvested on their rooftops.
The highest peak electricity demand this financial year occurred on Jan. 24, 2021 – the hottest summer day for much of the country’s east. The pressure placed on the grid that day was lower than each of the previous five summers.
Hugh Saddler, an energy consultant and honorary associate professor at Australian National University, said in the National Energy Emissions Audit for the Australia Institute that this phenomenon was “undoubtedly caused by the growing supply from rooftop solar.” Rooftop solar is now generating more energy for the grid than coal plants.
“Rooftop solar made a larger contribution to the grid during the 2020-21 peak demand than either Liddell (output of 750 MW) or Yallourn (output of 1.3 GW),” Saddler said in the report, in reference to two of Australia’s biggest coal-fired power stations.
Prices plunge
The rise of solar in Australia has driven wholesale electricity prices down to depths not seen in almost a decade.
“There were fewer prices above AUD 300 ($233)/MWh this quarter than in any other Q1 since 2012, and there were also near record numbers of negative prices in Victoria and South Australia,” the Australian Energy Regulator said. “As a result, black coal generation fell to its lowest ever Q1 level, and gas generation fell to its lowest Q1 level since 2005.”
The Australian Energy Regulator’s report noted that both Victoria and New South Wales consumed less than 1 petajoule of gas last quarter. In other words, gas-fired electricity hit its lowest level in 16 years, and was overtaken by solar.
This week, the government of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison pledged AUD 600 million of unallocated funding from the recent budget to build the controversial 660 MW Kurri Kurri gas plant in New South Wales. The announcement followed the publication of the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Net Zero by 2050: a Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector report. The IEA says in no uncertain terms that to reach net zero by the middle of the century, there must be “from today, no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects, and no further final investment decisions for new unabated coal plants.”

Maxeon Solar Technologies has released its new Maxeon Air technology platform.
The company said the platform enables it to produce frameless, thin, lightweight and conformable solar panels with efficiency and performance ratings that are equivalent to standard solar panels. The platform is the result of five years of research, development and testing.
Maxeon said its new Air solar panels can be adhered directly to rooftops without the need for racking or other mounting systems. Because of their adhesive, lightweight nature, the technology will initially target installations on rooftops that are not engineered to support the weight of conventional solar systems. In Europe, where Maxeon Air will first launch, the company estimated an unserved annual market for low-load roofs of more than 4 GW.
The Air panels do not use metal frames and contain no glass, resulting in an install load of roughly 6 kg/m². The product essentially appears to be a solar panel sticker, with Maxeon saying that the integrated adhesive layer enables installation directly on the roof surface, without racking, anchors, or ballast. This will enable installation on uneven rooftops.
The company said that the cells within the panels include a solid metal foundation, along with stress-relieved cell interconnects. It said these will protect against corrosion and enable fault-tolerant circuits that allow energy flow, even with cracked cells. Additionally, the panels feature an efficiency rating of 20.9%, a low power-temperature coefficient, shade tolerance, wide spectral response, and hot-spot resistance.
The product will become widely available in the first quarter of 2022.
