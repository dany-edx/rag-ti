Cypriot Andreas Procopiou said Watts Battery, which is preparing to move its headquarters to the United States, “would love to get into” the Cypriot market but, without a supportive policy framework, and with national utility the Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC) enjoying a monopoly on conventional power generation and the supply of electricity, there is little incentive, if any, to invest in storage.
Cypriot energy minister Natasa Pilides told pv magazine, via Twitter, that for storage, “home systems are already eligible for funding under our current funding program, while for large scale systems, funding will be announced after the relevant regulatory framework, which is being designed by CERA [the Cyprus Energy Regulatory Authority], is introduced.”
Whilst it is true Cyprus included residential batteries alongside PV in the systems eligible for a purchase subsidies program launched last month, the nation already has a net metering regime which is available to household solar. Without policy to further support energy storage, the owners of solar arrays have no great reason to invest in a home battery, purchase incentive or no.
It is an example of putting the cart before the horse which Watts Battery's Procopiou remarked upon. “What surprises me is that the government announced financial incentives for household energy efficiency upgrades but [the] EAC does not have a framework and policies in place for such cases,” he said. 
The situation is not helped by the near monopoly on power generation for the island held by the EAC. With the utility operating all Cyprus' natural gas and diesel facilities, and being the sole electricity supplier in the nation, the 10% or so of renewables in the Cypriot power mix are the only element not owned by the electric company. That is a situation which is unlikely to persuade the EAC to supercharge the energy transition, according to Procopiou. It exacerbates the lack of energy storage, he said, “as any new ideas, pilots, and frameworks need to be aligned with [the EAC's] interests.”
He added: “Our market is not in Cyprus, simply because there is no market [for energy storage], or at least not ready yet; with solar net-metering schemes being in place, the [battery storage] value proposition for grid-connected houses is not that obvious … Until energy storage becomes a reality in Cyprus, even if Cyprus ramps up the installation of renewable energy generation sources, primarily solar, their potential will be under-used, and electricity cost will not see a significant drop due to the dependence on traditional, fossil fuel generation.”
That roughly 10% of the Cypriot energy mix supplied by clean electricity is short of the 16% goal which was set for last year.
The figure the state is aiming for by 2030 is “at least [a] 26% share of renewables in gross final electricity consumption.” In the meantime, EAC fossil fuel facilities will continue to burn fossil fuels to electrify one of the EU's most sun washed countries.
The government has at least taken a step in the right direction by announcing it is installing 405 photovoltaic systems on the rooftops of its public schools.
The first array was installed at the Athienou Primary School and the remaining 404 will be completed by March, the Cypriot government said, for a total 4.9 MW of solar generation capacity.
A previous drive which saw 114 public schools fitted with solar – securing 1 MW of generation capacity – was financed by feed-in tariffs paid for the energy generated. This time around, however, an EAC spokesperson told pv magazine the arrays will offer net metering payments, so schools can benefit by reducing their grid electricity consumption and, therefore, the size of their bills.
The development of the new project is innovative. 
Specifically, all 405 solar rooftops will belong to the Ministry of Education, however the construction, financing and operation of the project will be devolved to the EAC.
The authority split the project into 11 tranches of 30-40 schools so small engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) companies could participate in the tender. Depending on experience, EPCs could be allocated up to three schools tranches.
That led to stunning results, said the EAC spokesperson. Some 16 firms participated in the tender, which announced five winners. That meant the project is running very quickly, with all five EPCs working on different tranches.
Moreover, added the spokesperson, the high number of bidders meant very low bids were received and the overall cost of the arrays is lower than the project budget. The EAC’s initial budget was €9.6 million, out of its own funds, but the government has confirmed the cost of the program has come down to €9 million, reflecting the tender savings.
The new school solar rooftops will help the Ministry of Education save around €790,000 per year by generating up to 1.7 MWh of electricity on-site annually.
The Ministry of Energy and the EAC collaborated on the design of the project and opted for arrays of 3 kW, 5 kW, 10 kW, and 20 kW, depending on school size.
Net metering makes sense for schools, said the EAC spokesperson, because the electricity consumption calculations are carried out every March, enabling schools to transfer credits for electricity they generate during summer, when the buildings stand empty, to offset electricity bills from the autumn and winter terms.
The EAC will be responsible for the first 10 years of the project’s operation.
The authority spokesperson stressed the utility has itself embraced PV generation, by installing a 425 kW solar system at its headquarters in the capital city of Nicosia this year. Unlike the net-metered school installations, the EAC's solar panels will be financed under the nation's net billing regime, which shields the utility from being out of pocket by ensuring solar system owners are not paid more for excess power they generate over the year than the value of the grid electricity they consume.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/29/itrpv-large-formats-are-here-to-stay/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"APRIL 29, 2021",ITRPV: Large formats are here to stay,"German engineering association the VDMA (Verbandes Deutsche Maschinen- und Anlagenbau) today published the twelfth edition of its annual International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics (ITRPV) report. Based on input from experts across the supply chain, the report analyzes recent trends in the PV technology space and makes predictions as to the direction the industry will take in the next decade.
This year, the report calculates that with each doubling of installed PV capacity worldwide, prices have fallen by 23.8%. And it expects this trend to continue, with improvements in cell and wafer technologies, the move to larger wafer formats, and continued adoption of bifacial set to be key drivers in the next round of cost reduction.
VDMA expects the older 156.75mm and 158.75mm to disappear entirely in the next four years, and the more recently introduced 166mm product to fall from a 34% share currently to around 5% in 2031. These will be replaced by the larger 182mm and 210mm formats launched in 2019, expected to account for 42% of the market each in 2031.
With these larger wafers, module sizes have also increased, and the ITRPV forecasts modules for the utility-scale sector measuring three square meters beyond to be available in 2031. “In power plant applications, 25% of modules are currently larger than 2.2m², with this share expected to increase to over 90% in 2031,” reads the report. “It is also expected that 16% of modules will be larger than 3m².”
The latest ITRPV estimates that p-type PERC (passivated emitter rear cell) technology represents around 80% of the market today, and will still account for 50% ten years from now. The report expects heterojunction to grow its share to around 17% of the market by 2031, with other passivated contact cells, particularly with n-type wafers – such as TOPCon. “Concepts on n- and p-type material with passivated contacts using tunnel oxide passivation stacks at the rearside will gain market share from about 6% in 2021 up to 50% within the next 10 years,” the report continues. “We estimate that n-type bulk material will become mainstream for concepts with passivated contacts and that only a much smaller share will deploy p-type material.”
Elsewhere, ITRPV expects continued growth for bifacial technologies. Estimated at a little under 30% of the market last year, these are expected to account for almost 80% of production by 2031.
The report also expects cell metallization to continue to rely on silver, noting the importance of continued reduction in its consumption per cell. The report forecasts a median value of 80mg of silver per cell for PERC technology today, falling to 50mg in 2031. VDMA warns, however, that n-type cells show much higher silver consumption and that efforts to reduce it must continue.
Despite this, VDMA does not expect any breakthrough in alternative metallization strategies without silver, and forecasts copper metallization to account for 12% of the market in 2031. “Technical issues related to reliability and adhesion must be resolved before alternative metallization techniques can be introduced. Appropriate equipment and processes also need to be made ready for mass production,” the report states. “Silver is expected to remain the most widely used front metallization material for c-Si cells in the years to come.”

The cell, which they described as a low-cost and environmentally friendly device, was fabricated by depositing the Sb2Se3 films on soda-lime glass substrates coated with molybdenum (Mo) using closed space sublimation (CSS), which is a physical vapor deposition process commonly used in the production of thin-films and cadmium telluride (CdTe) panels.
A bulk Sb2Se3 absorber layer was deposited using the source plate. “The obtained absorber layers were then selenized at temperatures from 350 to 450 degrees Celsius in argon at a base pressure of 10 Torr with 100 mg selenium for 30 minutes to promote the recrystallization of Sb2Se3,” the academics explained.
After this production step was concluded, the group deposited a 55 nano-meter thick cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer onto the absorber using chemical bath deposition. They then deposited a front contact layer comprising a 50 nm high-resistive intrinsic zinc oxide (i-ZnO) layer and a 250 nm aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) via radio frequency (RF) sputtering. All these layers were scribed together to form a solar cell with an active area of 0.2 cm².
“The results indicate that a proper selenization temperature is critical to achieving Sb2Se3 films with large grains, uniform morphology, high crystallinity, desired crystal orientations, and increased carrier density,” the researchers stated.
The device is presented in the paper Influence of Post-selenization Temperature on the Performance of Substrate-Type Sb2Se3 Solar Cells, published in ACS Publications.

José Manuel Soria was Spain's minister of industry, energy and tourism from December 2011 to April 2016, and is still well known in the Spanish renewable energy sector for being the promoter of the so-called ‘solar tax,' which was introduced in 2015 and for more three years completely halted the development of rooftop PV in Spain.
Although installations with a capacity of up to 10 kW were exempted, the measure had a dissuasive effect on smaller systems because many homeowners feared the rules may be further extended, abruptly, and be applied to them with a retroactive effect. Soria, on the other hand, was also responsible for the moratorium on renewables, which in 2012 stopped, abruptly, a series of incentives granted to the renewable energy sector, and also introduced a series of retroactive cuts for the feed-in tariffs granted by the country's energy provisions.
Coming to our days, Soria seems to have a completely different idea of the role of solar and renewables as he has recently been named president of Island Green Power España SL, the Spanish unit of U.K.-based developer of large photovoltaic plants, Island Green Power.
The company has more than 25 years of experience in the energy industry, 10 of them specifically in the photovoltaic solar energy sector. It has already carried out more than 900 MW of projects around the world.
According to its web page, it is currently developing seven projects in Spain, totaling 329.9 MW.

This week, Dutch start-up We Drive Solar and the Korean conglomerate Hyundai have announced a plan to deploy 500 EV recharging stations with bi-directional technology in the city and region of Utrecht.
Through the recharging stations, the electric vehicles will not only be recharged but also deliver power to the grid when the storage of renewable energy on a large scale is more needed. The stations will be initially tested on Hyundai's Ioniq 5 car, which is equipped with bi-directional charging technology. “By early 2022, the number of cars [will be] scaled up to 150 bidirectional shared cars in Utrecht,” the two companies said in a statement.
The project includes standardization and embedding of protocols, software-mediated control of charging stations, a scientific validation of the proposed “bi-directional ecosystem,” the large scale application of bidirectional shared cars in a green urban district, and coupling car-sharing reservations with bidirectional charging.
“Technical details of this project will be released at a later stage,” a spokesperson from We Drive Solar told pv magazine.
The Dutch company and Hyundai announced their partnership to bring this bi-directional solution to PV system owners, in mid-April.
We Drive Solar is also participating in the €3.3 million ‘Robust' research project aimed at providing the congested Dutch power network with more flexibility. Among the project partners there are, Delft University of Technology, Utrecht University of Applied Sciences, the Municipality of Utrecht, and the Municipality of Arnhem.

In stipulating to its subsidiaries and major state-owned enterprises that the proportion taken up by solar and wind power in the national power generation mix must rise to 11% this year, the NEA also ordered the use of energy storage for the first time.
The NEA has told grid companies to provide sufficient network connection points for new solar and wind generation projects, starting with facilities registered in 2019 and 2020. Project capacity planned from this year onwards must include a certain proportion of energy storage capacity, the NEA stated in a notification, following similar moves by some provincial authorities concerned about a lack of grid connection capacity.
The NEA notice setting the 11% renewables target, up from 9.7% last year, requires the proportion of solar and wind in the national power mix to rise gradually to 16.5% in 2025, as part of plans, announced by president Xi Jinping, for China's carbon emissions to peak this decade and for the country to hit carbon neutrality by 2060.

IRENA, in its Planning and prospects for renewable power: Eastern and southern Africa report, examined energy commitments made by member nations of regional grid networks the Eastern African Power Pool and Southern African Power Pool stretching out to 2040, and also included South Sudan but excluded Libya.
The international thinktank identified numerous promising, grid-connected solar and onshore wind development regions in the nations considered, based on anticipated levelized cost of energy and vicinity to transmission infrastructure. The potential of those sites was combined with existing power development commitments to model a base case for future energy mixes in the two power pools. IRENA then modeled five alternative future scenarios, based on restricting the penetration of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources solar and wind; unlimited renewables adoption; planning to compensate for drought to reduce hydropower production; delayed hydro project construction; and freeing up more trans-border interconnector capacity.
In the high-VRE scenario, Zimbabwe could more than double the 1.51 GW of solar and wind capacity it has committed to installing this decade, to 3.4 GW; the 60 MW of facilities pledged in Zambia by 2030 could become 4.2 GW; and Ethiopia‘s commitment to plug in 6 GW of solar and wind this decade could be ramped up to 26 GW.
With its reference case predicting 132.4 GW of new solar in the 22 countries considered for the report, that figure could rise to 134.6 GW under the model which is planned to compensate for hydropower shortfalls – or fall to 68.6 GW if policies such as fossil fuel subsidies keep development more in line with the limited-VRE outcome.
The study, which caveats it is based on the assumption of rising coal, gas and oil costs and both favors VRE and underestimates the electricity firming capacity needed to support them by averaging out seasonal and daily solar and wind generation profiles, also spells out the extra costs of pursuing a regional push for renewables.
IRENA estimates its reference case scenario would require generation investment of US$562 billion as part of a US$2.03 trillion overall system cost. That generation investment figure rises to US$642 billion in the high variable renewables model and could fall to US$480 million if clean energy penetration was limited. In terms of overall system cost, the volume of renewables required to cover for drought-affected hydro power has the biggest cost, at US$2.09 trillion, while providing more interconnector capacity would be most cost-effective, at US$2.029 trillion.
The current plans laid out by the two regional power pools envision coal-fired power generation capacity rising from around 50 GW today through the addition of 107 GW of new plants by 2040. In that reference case, solar and wind would contribute 36% of the power mix but the figure could be as high as half of the generation facilities, according to IRENA, with the addition of hydropower ensuring renewables would comprise 63% of the power mix. The addition of renewables could see the scale of the coal fleet in the regions considered fall to 35 GW in 2040.
Of the most promising 24 solar and wind development regions identified by IRENA in the nations studied, three of the top four, including the most promising site, are PV-friendly areas of South Africa. The top location could host 5.83 GW of solar from 2028, according to the study, and numbers three and four on the list could feature 3.2 GW and 2.83 GW this decade, with the latter able to grow to 3.95 GW by 2040. Both of those two options already feature solar farms. The next 15 variable renewables zones, like the second, are listed for wind power potential but there are further solar locations in South Africa (up to 1.28 GW in 2030, starting from 2027), Tanzania (1.2 GW in 2030, rising to 3.09 GW), Ethiopia (1.18 GW in 2030, from 2027), and Sudan (1.08 GW in 2030, rising to 2.16 GW, and starting from 2026).

In October 2017, the German customs authorities claimed to have “discovered a fraudulent cartel for solar modules.”
One local county politician from the district of Erlangen-Höchstadt was arrested in the case. Sunowe executives and employees in Nuremberg were suspected of having evaded €20 million ($24.2 million) in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy tariffs, while also circumventing the minimum import price (MIP) for crystalline solar modules from China since December 2013.
In March 2019, a trial against six defendants, including the Erlangen-Höchstadt politician, began before the third criminal chamber of the Nuremberg-Fürth regional court. The main hearing was later suspended in order to give the customs investigation office time to present “central evidence,” but the case was further delayed. The pandemic later meant that very little happened in 2020.
“(The process) will now restart on May 3,” said Alexander Rumpf, a lawyer of Sunowe from Dannenfeldt & Rumpf Rechtsanwälte. In the summer of 2019, he spoke of a “miserable failure of the prosecution,” because the Nuremberg public prosecutor and the customs investigation offices were unable to produce important documentation from the Netherlands.
Some of the people who were arrested have been in custody for up to 1.5 years. They are Chinese citizens who are suspected of being flight risks. They have still not returned to China and will be present when the trial resumes, Rumpf said.
The European Union introduced a minimum import price in December 2013 to replace anti-dumping and anti-subsidy tariffs for PV modules from China.

“The hybrid inverter is initially being launched in Europe and the combination of the inverter with the battery will be launched in Australia,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The high-voltage SBR lithium iron phosphate battery uses LiFePO4 as the cathode material and has a storage capacity between 9.6 kWh and 102.4 kWh, depending on the number of modules.
A three-module device has a capacity of 9.6 kWh, a nominal voltage of 192 V, and DC power of 5.76 kW. Its short circuit current is 1,700 A and the continuous maximum charge-discharge current is 30 A. It measures 625x545x330mm, weighs 114kg, and features a 10-year performance guarantee. The battery uses natural convection as a cooling system.
The hybrid three-phase inverter, called SH5.0/6.0/8.0/10RT, is available in five versions, with nominal AC power output ranging from 5 kW to 10 kW. Depending on this value, the device's efficiency spans from 98% andto 98.4%, and the European efficiency from 97.2% to 97.9%.
The product comes with two maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs while its MPPT voltage range is 150-950 V. Its maximum input current (DC) is 25 A and the maximum short circuit current ranges from 32 A to 48 A. It is equipped with IP65 protection, natural convection air cooling, and can be used in projects at altitudes of up to 4,000m, and in temperatures ranging from -25 degrees Celsius to 60 degrees Celsius. It is compatible with lithium-ion batteries and a battery voltage of 150-600 V.
Referring to the Australian rooftop PV market, Sungrow said that the proposed solution can help optimize self-consumption by storing excessive energy in the battery and perform as backup power, offering continuous power supply in case of a grid outage. “Besides, charging from the grid during off-peak and discharging at peak can be profitable. With an increasing number of residential systems connect[ed] to virtual power plant (VPP) networks, the solutions are compatible with multiple devices, benefiting the users from VPP business models immediately,” the manufacturer explained.

New York state has launched its fifth annual solicitation for large-scale renewable projects to accelerate the rapid pace of clean energy development and combat climate change, in the state’s largest land-based procurement to date.
The solicitation calls for approximately 4.5 million MWh of renewable electricity per year. Eligible projects include any installation that can be certified as Tier 1 renewable technologies, as long they commenced operations after Jan. 1, 2015. Projects will also be eligible if they commence commercial operations by Nov. 30, 2023, with an option to extend to Nov. 30, 2026. NYSERDA expects to notify the awarded developers in late 2021.
Along with the solicitation came word that more than 20 large-scale renewable energy infrastructure projects will be under construction across the state this year, including the first utility-scale solar project in upstate New York.
Located in Easton, just north of Albany, the 20 MW Branscomb Solar project, developed and constructed by CS Energy and owned by Goldman Sachs Renewable Power, will generate more than $20 million in private investment. It will also create nearly 100 jobs to support its construction and future operations and maintenance in the Albany region.
The announcements advance progress toward New York’s goal of having 70% of the state’s electricity come from renewable sources by 2030, as outlined in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. 
Across the previous four renewable energy solicitations, New York has contracted with more than 90 new large-scale renewable energy facilities, including solar plants, onshore wind farms, and hydroelectric facilities – some of which have been paired with energy storage. These installations have brought significant private investment, new jobs, and economic development to communities in more than 30 counties.
NYSERDA’s competitive program has leveraged the declining cost of renewable energy, with the latest round of awarded projects priced over 40% lower than those awarded just a year previously, maintaining the cost-effective ramp-up of renewable energy across the state.
New York’s pipeline of large-scale renewable energy projects will add nearly 11 GW of clean power to the grid when completed. The pipeline will enable the state to derive more than 50% of its electricity from renewable sources.

Researchers from the University of Queensland and Brisbane-based Graphene Manufacturing Group (GMG) are teaming up to develop faster-charging, more sustainable battery prototypes with lifespans three times the length of current lithium-ion batteries. 
GMG, which was recently listed on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada, has reached a research agreement with scientists from the University of Queensland’s Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) to build batteries for anything from watches to grid storage and everything in between, including phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. 
The University of Queensland technology, which sees an aluminum ion battery paired with graphene electrodes, was designed by Professor Michael Yu, Xiaodan Huang and postdoctoral student Yueqi Kong as a way to make graphene into more efficient electrodes for powering batteries. The technology has already been patented and licensed by UniQuest, the University of Queensland's commercialization company.
Graphene is the wonder material of the age. It's the thinnest and strongest material known to science, and, if that wasn’t enough, it is also a great conductor of electricity – better even than copper. Or at least, it would be the wonder material of the age if the so-called “graphene revolution” promised less and delivered more. 
It was more than a decade ago that scientists from the University of Manchester won the Nobel Prize for Physics thanks to some simple tape that proved to be a breakthrough in extracting graphene from everyday graphite. 

In essence, graphene is just good old carbon, but it is tessellated in such a way to produce a bogglingly strong bond between atoms. Of course, like anything with so much promise and hype, the graphene revolution has taken longer than expected, but that is only because people don’t have much patience for the things they’ve been promised, especially when it is something as potentially ubiquitous as graphene. 
Nevertheless, the University of Queensland and GMG are not the only parties making progress. In March, scientists at China’s Dalian University of Technology and the University of Nebraska in the United States collaborated to fabricate a battery consisting of a pure aluminum anode, a graphene cathode, and an organic electrolyte. The batteries are described in “Ultra-fast charging in aluminium-ion batteries: electric double layers on active anode,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.
Back in 2019, scientists at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) demonstrated a laser printing process that enables graphene supercapacitors to be embedded directly onto textiles, creating a fabric that can store energy and be integrated with a solar cell and used to power smart fabric applications.
Graphene batteries
“Testing showed rechargeable graphene aluminium ion batteries had a battery life of up to three times that of current leading lithium-ion batteries,” said AIBN Director Professor Alan Rowan. “And higher power density meant they charged up to 70 times faster.” 
AIBN has been working hard on the technology for several years, and the research team is excited to be shifting into a commercial prototype development stage, especially as the promise on the cards is more efficient and greener batteries. 
“The batteries are rechargeable for a larger number of cycles without deteriorating performance and are easier to recycle, reducing potential for harmful metals to leak into the environment,” said Rowan. 
UniQuest CEO Dean Moss said he believes aluminum ion batteries with graphene electrodes “could transform the existing rechargeable battery market. Lithium-ion batteries demand the extraction of rare earth materials using large amounts of water and are processed with chemicals that can potentially harm the environment.” 
GMG CEO Craig Nicol agrees, noting that the possibility for the energy storage market included far-reaching benefits in safety, efficiency, sustainability. He points to the ability of aluminum ion batteries “to use local raw materials to manufacture battery cells at a competitive cost to replace imported lithium-ion cells is a massive opportunity for GMG and Australia to reduce supply chain risks and create local jobs.” 
University of Queensland scientists were awarded a AUD 390,000 ($303,600) grant over three years from the Australian Research Council’s Linkage Project in 2020 to develop graphene aluminum ion technology.
