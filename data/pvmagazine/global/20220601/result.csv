It built the push boat at a shipyard in Derben, Germany, over a period of almost two years. “The entire project is a blueprint for climate and environmentally friendly inland navigation and a true pioneering achievement, not only technically but also in regulatory terms,” said German Minister for Transport Volker Wissing.
Washington State University researchers have used an ethanol and water mixture in a novel conversion system with an anode and a cathode to produce pure compressed hydrogen. The process could reduce the cost of hydrogen transport. “Hydrogen could be made on site at fueling stations, so only the ethanol solution would have to be transported,” the researchers said. They put a small amount of electricity into the ethanol and water mixture with a catalyst, electrochemically producing pure compressed hydrogen. The project, funded by the Gas Technology Institute and the US Department of Energy's RAPID Manufacturing Institute, was recently described in Applied Catalysis A. 
Iberdrola has commissioned Europe's largest green hydrogen production plant in Puertollano, Spain. It developed the project, which produces green hydrogen with a 20 MW electrolyzer, for Fertiberia. It includes a 100 MW solar array and four fully integrated 40-foot battery containers, as part of a 1.25 MW/5 MWh battery system supplied by Ingeteam.
UK Energy Storage (UKEn), a subsidiary of UK Oil & Gas, has signed a lease agreement with Portland Port Ltd. for two sites at the former Royal Navy port in Dorset, England. It aims to develop an integrated energy hub centered on hydrogen-ready gas storage and future green hydrogen-generating capabilities. The project builds upon an unrealized Portland Gas Storage plan for an underground salt cavern storage facility.
The Port of Tallinn in Estonia and Poland's Port of Gdynia Authority have signed a letter of intent to cooperate on hydrogen management. Gdynia wants to establish a hub to produce and store renewable hydrogen. It also aims to use hydrogen-based fuels to propel vessels. “Hydrogen will help Port of Tallinn create new value chains and economic opportunities and in doing so reach carbon neutrality,” said Valdo Kalm, CEO of the Port of Tallinn. 
Renewable Energy Hub Flevoland is now set to supply 1 GW of sustainable energy to the Netherlands by 2030, as GIGA-Storage, EQUANS, Circul8 Energy, Smartgrid Flevoland, Solarvation, ACRRES and Wageningen University & Research have agreed to teamed up on its development. The hub will combine wind, solar, batteries and hydrogen. “In this way, power can be continuously supplied to the grid, even when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing,” said the provincial authorities in Flevoland, which aims to become the Dutch testing ground for storage solutions.
Corstyrene inaugurated its first two hydrogen stations on May 19 in Aléria, Corsica. The expanded polystyrene specialist has teamed up with green hydrogen producer Atawey to install an electrolyzer that will produce up to 1 ton of green hydrogen per year, powered by 100 kWp of solar shading systems.

They modeled their distributed multi-generation (DMG) unit with TRNSYS software, which is used to simulate the behavior of transient renewables systems. They assessed the system performance when meeting heating demand for a single-floor home in northwestern China.
The system has two flow circuits to store energy and supply energy. The heat storage circuit consists of a PVT system, a heat storage pump, and a cylindrical storage tank with an immersed coiled-tube heat exchanger.
“The pump drives the working flow running at a rated velocity in this loop. A differential controller based on temperature is used to switch on/off the heat storage pump,” the scientists said.
The heat supply circuit features a storage tank, a heating-side pump, flow diverters, an electrical heating boiler, and heating loads.
“The reason why the heat storage tank is contained in both circuits is that it is the crucial energy exchanger/buffer which bridges the gap between the two loops,” said the scientists.
The PVT system provides electrical energy and heat. The electricity is transmitted to an electrical heating boiler, which raises the system's heating fluid temperature to a desirable level.
The biomass generator is used to meet any excess power demand for the boiler that can't be met by the PVT installation alone. The storage tank and the boiler supply thermal energy to the heating loads via the heat supply circuit.
“For the entire heating season, solar power predominates the energy supply side, with the biomass energy generation kicking in when needed to make up the energy deficit,” said researcher Lei Xu.
The PV system generate 52% of the electrical energy and 8% of the available thermal energy, with the biomass producing the remaining 40% of the electricity needed to heat the home. The scientists described the system in detail in “Modeling and assessment of a novel solar-biomass based distributed multi-generation system,” which was recently published in the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy.

“Electric truck hydropower” (ETH) involves the transport of water from small streams at high altitudes in electricity truck containers that can transform it into electricity via regenerative braking. Regenerative braking is an energy recovery mechanism that takes the wasted energy from the process of slowing down a vehicle and uses it to recharge batteries.
The system can reduce electricity consumption and also lower a vehicle's braking load. The scientists said the electricity stored in the vehicles via this process could be sold to the grid or used by trucks for transport purposes.
“The ideal configuration of the ETH system is in mountainous regions with steep roads, where the same electrical trucks can be used to generate hydropower from different sites. This increases the chances that there will be water available to generate hydropower and thus increases the capacity factor of the system,” the scientists said.
They added that the system would have a minimal impact on a river's aquatic life, as the water collected at high altitudes could be returned to the same river once the trucks have reached the bottoms of hills.
“The reservoirs of this system are containers parked close to a river stream on the mountain, which are filled up with water extracted from the river,” they said. “After the container is filled up, it is ready to be transported down the mountain and to generate hydropower.”
The system would include an electric truck, water containers, a charge site, and a discharge site. The truck driver would have to control the descending speed of the filled truck to produce electricity. After vehicles reach discharge sites and empty their tanks into rivers, discharged batteries could replace charged batteries to restart the cycle.
“The battery is not fully discharged, as the truck requires energy to drive up the mountain with an empty container,” the researchers said. “The discharge site should have a robust connection to the national grid to allow the site to supply electricity to the grid.”
Some locations in the Andes or the Himalayas have the potential to generate 15 TWh per year through this technology, the scientists claimed.
“The continent with the highest potential is Asia with 617 TWh, South America with 466 TWh, Central America with 65 TWh, Europe with 56 TWh, Africa with 17 TWh, North America with 5 TWh, and Australia with 0.7 TWh,” they said. “The global potential for ETH is estimated to be 1226 TWh.”
They estimated the capex of ETH projects at between $200/kW and $500/kW, or $30/MWh to $100/MWh. Conventional hydropower plants would come in at $1,000/kW and $5,000/kW or $50/MWh to $200/MWh, they claimed.
“Given that the ETH system is already a competitive electricity generation alternative with existing technology, its cost is expected to further reduce with expected technological improvements in the near future,” the scientists said.
The academics presented their findings in “Electric Truck Hydropower, a flexible solution to hydropower in mountainous regions,” which was recently published in Energy. The group includes researchers from Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, the Federal University of Espírito Santo, the University of São Paulo, the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Aalto University, Aarhus University School of Business and Social Sciences, the University of Oxford, and the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences.

Brazilian solar developers imported 5.27 GW of solar modules in the first quarter of the year, up 128.1% from the same period in 2021, when 2.32 GW were imported, according to data collected by the consulting firm Greener.
The quarterly figure already exceeds the 4.88 GW of modules imported during the entire second half of 2021. High-power solar panels with outputs above 500 W accounted for more than 60% of all PV module imports to the country by volume.
Greener has also reported that the quarterly imports of inverters reached 3.06 GW by volume, up 26.4% from the same period in 2021, when shipments reached 2.51 GW.
The significant growth in shipments, outpacing growth in new installations, underscores how equipment distributors are preparing for the anticipated installation rush later this year under current net metering rules. From next year, owners of PV systems up to 5 MW in size will have to pay grid fees.
In the first quarter, 1.45 GW of new solar plants were built in Brazil, according to data from the National Electric Energy Agency (Aneel), with 1,253 MW of distributed-generation (DG) installations and 200 MW of large-scale capacity. In the same period of 2021, developers constructed 866 MW of DG solar, but no new solar parks were built.

The GSE awarded 300 MW of solar capacity across 34 locations, but only one 6 MW wind project was selected in the exercise. Twenty-seven of the projects will have capacities of less than 10 MW, while the remaining eight projects will range in size from 11.8 MW to 53 MW.
The selected bidders for the solar plants included well-known Italian power suppliers such as Acea and Edison. Other bidders were special purpose vehicles without clear links to noted industry players.
All of the developers offered a maximum discount ranging from 2% to 3.02% from the auction ceiling price of €0.065/kWh. The lowest bid came in at €0.06036/kWh and was offered for a 7.8 MW solar project located in the province of Campobasso, in the Italian central region of Umbria.
The highest bid of €0.0637/kWh was submitted for 11 solar projects spread across the regions of Sardinia, Lazio, Emilia Romagna, Apulia, Piedmont, and Veneto. The bids were slightly higher or equal to those in the seventh renewable energy auction, when discounts ranged from 2.0% to 3.5%.
In the last procurement exercise, held in January, the GSE allocated 974.9 MW of renewables capacity, including 710.2 MW of solar. In the sixth auction, held in September 2021, the Italian authorities allocated 297 MW of solar power, with bids ranging from €0.0686/kWh to €0.0646/kWh. In the fifth procurement exercise, finalized in May, the lowest bid came in at €0.0685/kWh and was submitted for a 3.4 MW solar project.
Overall, only 32 MW of solar were allocated. In the fourth round of the tender scheme, solar secured 20 MW, while the lowest bid was €0.06819/kWh.
In the third renewables auction, held in October, the GSE assigned 95.5 MW of solar capacity across four locations. The lowest bid, submitted for a PV project, was €0.06490/kWh.
In the second renewables auction, only 19.3 MW of PV capacity was allocated across four projects. The lowest price of €56/MWh was offered for a solar project. In the first procurement round, only one 5 MW solar plant was awarded, along with 495 MW of wind capacity. The single PV project will sell electricity for €0.060/kWh.
Following the completion of the latest auction, the Italian authorities have allocated around 1.5 GW of PV through the nation's tender program.

Transgrid has confirmed that work has begun on the New South Wales section of the 900-kilometer Project EnergyConnect, which will link the grids of New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria, while supporting the development of new wind, solar and energy storage projects.
Project EnergyConnect, a joint venture between Transgrid and South Australian network operator ElectraNet, will link Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, to Robertstown, South Australia. It will also include an additional “spur” link in northwestern Victoria. The interconnector will provide 800 MW of nominal transfer capacity in both directions and is expected to unlock about 5.3 GW of new renewable energy projects.
The project is a critical link in the National Electricity Market (NEM), with proponents claiming it will enhance power system security. Transgrid CEO Brett Redman said the project “will help deliver the grid of the future.” He also said the project, Australia’s biggest electricity interconnector to date, will increase wholesale electricity competition and help drive down electricity prices.
ElectraNet Interim Chief Executive Rainer Korte said the project will improve energy security in all states, while accelerating the transition to a grid based around wind, solar and storage.
“EnergyConnect is a landmark project of national significance that will enable more renewable energy and improve the affordability, reliability, and security of electricity supply,” he said.
Project EnergyConnect will involve the installation of more than 9,000 kilometers of cabling, and the erection of 1,500 new transmission towers, using more than 30,000 tons of steel. Construction of the eastern portion of the project is expected to start in 2023, with the full project set for completion by 2024.

“The restart of production [at Moses Lake] is a direct result of Hanwha’s commitment to REC Silicon,” said REC, which has all of its wholly owned poly factories on US soil.
In January, the Hanwha Solutions division of Hanwha Group spent $160 million on a 16.7% stake in REC. It said the move was based on expected demand for solar polysilicon in the US market.
The polysilicon maker, which only manufactures products for semiconductor customers on US soil, said in its first-quarter results announcement that Moses Lake would restart production in the final quarter of 2023. Full ramp-up is expected in 2024, said REC.
The Moses Lake site, which has an annual production capacity of 20,000 metric tons of solar-grade poly, has been idle since the second quarter of 2019, when it was caught in the trade war between the United States and China. Chinese subsidies on US-made polysilicon effectively locked REC Silicon out of the world's biggest solar market, leaving the company with only its semiconductor polysilicon business and the supply of silane gas.
REC produces semiconductor-grade poly at a 2,000-metric-ton site in Butte, Montana. In its recent financial update, REC Silicon said it was talking to Hanwha Group, which operates a 1.7 GW solar module factory in the United States, about the supply of solar polysilicon and silane gas.
In October 2020, REC Silicon said it had signed a cooperation agreement with Oregon-based solar manufacturing startup Violet Power to be part of a non-Chinese silicon solar supply chain. REC has also revealed a similar tie-up with Group 14 Technologies to establish commercial silicon anode production facilities at Moses Lake.
REC reported first-quarter revenue of $34.6 million, down from $43.2 million in the previous three-month period. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization stood at $3.6 million, up from a loss of $400,000 in the previous quarter.
The company did not provide any quarterly profit or loss figures, but it reported cash balances of $204 million at the end of March, up from $111 million at the end of December 2021. The bank balance was mainly helped by a $110 million placement of equity, following Hanwha's investment.

The Texas power grid is notorious for being put to test by extreme heat as well as winter snow and ice storms. While battery owners from the utility scale down to homeowners provide needed power to the grid in many places around the world, Texas is not one of them. Tesla hopes to change that, and recently filed a request for a rule change (OBDRR) with the Electric Council of Texas (ERCOT) that would clear the way for utilities to bid on capacity stored in batteries.
Tesla would like to operate the distributed energy assets generated in its Powerwall batteries as a virtual power plant, and it is to that end that the company has launched a virtual power plant demonstration project. The company ran a similar virtual power plant (VPP) project last summer in California. In the Texas demonstration, Tesla plans to prove to ERCOT that a Powerwall fleet can provide these services in Texas by setting up a virtual power Plant comprised of volunteer Powerwall owners.
By opting in to the Tesla ERCOT Demonstration, Powerwalls will be used in tests and demonstrations with the Texas utility to establish the capabilities of the Powerwall fleet. What’s in it for those Powerwall customers that participate in at least 80% of the tests is a $40 Tesla gift card, and they also may gain the satisfaction of participating in something larger than meeting their own energy storage needs. They may prove to ERCOT that a band of Powerwalls has benefits.
In the demonstration project Tesla will control the participants’ Powerwalls including charging, discharging and configuring the device to automatically respond to grid conditions, and to support tests that demonstrate grid services. In the agreement Tesla promises to not draw the battery below 20% of its capacity, so that the Powerwall can be used for backup. Except for this limitation, Tesla may charge or discharge the Powerwalls at any time and to any extent.
The caveats in the agreement include that the total liability for any kind of damages will not exceed $500; that participants are encouraged to consult a tax professional regarding any potential impact on the Investment Tax Credit that the customer may have claimed on their Powerwall; the customer acknowledges that their Powerwall may have a reduced charge; and in the event of a power outage during the project, Tesla is not liable for any loss of power that the customer may experience.

Reuters reported in January that London-based Savannah Energy paid $626 million to Exxon Mobil and Petronas to acquire interests in Chad and neighboring Cameroon, including a 75% stake in the Doba Oil Project. The agreement announced by the company last week included a commitment to develop up to 300 MW of solar capacity plus a battery system to power the oil project and nearby towns of Moundou and Doba.
Savannah Energy did not state what proportion of the electricity to be generated by the Centrale Solaire de Komé solar-plus-storage project would power operations at the oil field. It did not specify the size of the battery system.
The company also agreed to install up to 100 MW of solar capacity, and the same volume of wind turbines, to generate electricity for the Chadian capital, N'Djamena. A press release issued by Savannah Energy last week stated that the Centrales d’Energie Renouvelable de N’Djamena project is “anticipated to benefit from the installation of a [battery energy storage system].”
If the latter projects reaches 200 MW in scale, Savannah Energy said, it would more than double the capital's grid-connected power generation capacity and would raise the power capacity of the entire nation by around 63%. At 300 MW, the Centrale Solaire de Komé facility would be “the largest solar project in sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa),” according to the energy company. It said it would also represent “the largest battery storage project in Africa.”
Savannah Energy CEO Andrew Knott said the agreement signed with Chad's Ministry of Petroleum and Energy marked one of the African nation's biggest foreign direct investment deals. He said it is likely “the largest ever by a British company” in Chad.
The energy company said the Centrale Solaire de Komé project will likely be approved in 2023. It is expected generate its first electricity in 2025. For the Centrales d’Energie Renouvelable de N’Djamena facility, the respective dates given were 2023-24 and 2025-26.
The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that Chad had just 1 MW of grid-connected solar capacity and 227 kW of off-grid arrays at the end of 2021.
