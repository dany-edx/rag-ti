An international consortium of solar energy researchers has created a new platform for analyzing the performance and reliability of PV systems located in different climate zones. The research project, called PV Camper, is aimed at creating is a cloud database that combines highly accurate meteorological values and photovoltaic performance data from different geographic and climatic areas.
Through the database, all researchers will be able to access daily updated data from a total of 13 testing facilities on almost every continent. They will also be offered a common baseline characterization and operating and management protocols as well as offers for joint research and development activities. The data may be used, for example, to improve the design and optimization of photovoltaic systems in certain operating environments for industrial clients.
The PV Camper consortium includes research institutes from the USA, Brazil, South Korea, Great Britain, Morocco, Singapore, Qatar and, in Germany, the Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics CSP and the Anhalt University of Applied Sciences are participating.
“Linking and exchanging high-quality data is essential to advance photovoltaic research and to open up new markets and applications for solar technologies,” said Ralph Gottschalg, head of Fraunhofer CSP and chairman of PV Camper. “We are creating one of the world's largest and most useful databases with quality-assured, comparable performance data from photovoltaics and [are enabling] them to be exchanged in a trusting manner.”
Gottschalg expects the project will reach a wide global dimension. “The collaboration will make it possible to transfer research results better to different climate zones and to optimize new types of technologies specifically for use there,” said the Fraunhofer researcher.

The former Singyes business, which was bailed out by state-owned construction group Shuifa in 2019, reported solar project revenue fell from RMB1.5 billion ($231 million), in 2019, to RMB1.19 billion ($183 million) last year, with delays caused by the global health crisis cited as the main reason.
Interestingly, the company's solar engineering, procurement and construction operation entirely reversed focus from public to commercial and industrial projects during 2020. Whereas Singyes had generated RMB1.12 billion from public projects in 2019, and just RMB381 million ($58.6 million) from commercial installations, those figures were reversed last year, to RMB24.8 million and RMB1.17 billion, respectively.
The group's overall performance was not dented, with the rise in total revenue adding up to net profits of RMB203 million, following a near-disastrous RMB976 million loss a year earlier.
New business activity helped things along, with the developer and manufacturer generating revenue of RMB189 million from the coal-fired steam business it acquired from its state-owned parent last year, for RMB190 million, and a further RMB925 million from a new venture selling petrochemical products. Both operations are grouped under the company's “renewable energy business” division.
Most of the figures on the balance sheet moved in the right direction, with the exception of current liabilities, which soared from RMB3.32 billion to RMB5.45 billion ($839 million). A large chunk of that came from “other payables and accruals,” which rose from RMB384 million in 2019 to RMB2.1 billion last year. The only explanation for the change, provided on page 225 of the 305-page annual report, was an “amounts due to related parties” figure, which rose from RMB10 million ($1.54 million) in 2019 to RMB1.49 billion last year, with no further information offered.

Apart from the CCS part of the project, which aims to store at least 5 metric tons per year of CO2 by 2030, Acorn wants to use North Sea natural gas and reform it into “blue” hydrogen. The associated CO2 emissions would be stored under the sea at the CO2 storage site. This is an example of the U.K.’s hydrogen strategy.
Australia-based energy company Origin Energy has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Port of Townsville, in Queensland, to collaborate on the potential expansion of the port and the development of new infrastructure, including a liquefaction facility. “Origin is collaborating with Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries on a 300 MW early-export project that would produce 36,500 tons per annum of green, liquid hydrogen using renewable energy and sustainable water,” Origin Energy said in a press release. The three companies expect the first exports, mostly to the Asian markets, to materialize “from the mid-2020s.”
Australia-based mining company Province Resources has signed a memorandum of understanding with French renewable energy developer Total Eren. The two companies could have equal shares in Province’s HyEnergy Zero Carbon Hydrogen project, proposed in northwest Western Australia. Total Eren, 30% owned by France-based multinational energy company Total, has more than 3.3 GW of renewable energy power plants worldwide. The project is to be developed in two stages, totaling up to 8 GW in installed renewable energy capacity. “Given the recent drive by state and federal governments to quickly develop and advance the green hydrogen industry in Australia, I am confident this project will be of strategic national importance,” commented Province managing director David Frances.
Switzerland-headquartered technology company Hitachi ABB Power Grids has signed a letter of intent with Helsinki-based P2X Solutions to electrify a 20 MW hydrogen production plant. The purpose of the €50 million project is to build Finland’s first industrial scale green hydrogen production plant. “Once the first large scale green hydrogen production plant has been demonstrated, P2X’s goal is to promote the Finnish hydrogen economy with more production plants and possibly replicate the projects in Europe as well,” reads a note released last week, adding that the plant is expected to be operational in 2024. Hitachi ABB Power Grids recently signed deals for energy-transition projects in Germany and China.
New Delhi-headquartered Uttam Group of Companies, a manufacturer of ultra-lightweight composite cylinders and systems for compressed natural gas and hydrogen, has closed on the purchase of U.S.-based Catalina Composites. The new entity, based in California, will now be known as Uttam Composites. The company will invest at least $20 million (€16.6 million) in staff, equipment, and research and development of high-pressure cylinder production for hydrogen and compressed natural gas. “Uttam’s advantage is that our cylinders are not only the lightest but [also] the most durable on the market, because of our proprietary manufacturing process,” Uttam chief executive officer Karan Bhatia told pv magazine. The acquisition should allow Uttam to expand to the U.S. and Europe, in addition to increasing its presence in the Asian market.
The Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association (FCHEA), the hydrogen organization representing more than 50 companies in the United States, has called for the public and private sectors to step up investments in hydrogen. “The growth of the hydrogen industry will also lead to the creation of well-paying engineering, manufacturing, sales and service jobs. That’s why it’s essential we invest in hydrogen now,” Morry Markowitz, president of the FCHEA, commented in a statement released last week. According to the organization, the U.S. is at risk of losing its competitive edge as other countries have already announced hydrogen investments worth hundreds of billions.
South African integrated energy and chemical company Sasol, and Toyota South Africa Motors, have announced a partnership to “commence exploration of the development of a green hydrogen mobility ecosystem in South Africa,” starting with zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell (FC) heavy-duty, long-haul trucks. Toyota’s subsidiary is developing prototype FC trucks in Japan. “In addition, the parties are evaluating the installation of a hydrogen refueling station for the demonstration project,” read a press release. Last week, Sasol and French multinational industrial gas provider Air Liquide launched a request for proposal (RFP) process to procure 900 MW of renewables in South Africa.
Aberdeen-based engineering and technical consultancy Vysus Group has secured a contract to deliver technical safety and risk studies for a new hydrogen refilling station in Spain. “Iberdrola plans to build the facility in the Port of Barcelona, Spain, in November 2021. The plant will produce, store and supply [green] hydrogen to heavy vehicles – specifically Barcelona Metropolitan Transport buses. Initially, it will produce 160kg of hydrogen per day, increasing production to 1,200kg per day. The project is currently in the design and purchasing stage,” read a note released last week.
Spanish multinational financial services company BBVA has joined the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, the organization promoted by the European Commission which gathers industry, national and local public authorities, civil society and other stakeholders together, for a total of 900 participants. In addition to BBVA, other participants from the financial sector include Citi, Deutsche Bank, ING, and Natixis. BBVA “recently announced that it will reduce its exposure to coal-related activities to zero, ceasing to finance companies in these activities before 2030 in developed countries, and before 2040 in the rest of the world,” read a note released on Monday.

Under the current Russian energy regulatory framework, these kinds of bilateral deals can be concluded between a seller and a buyer with a power distribution company mediating as a third party. “Voluntary bilateral agreements follow the same mechanisms as green certificates and are similar to PPAs in their basic form,” Usachev emphasized. “They are concluded between an independent power producer and a buyer searching for consumption of electricity generated by renewables for its manufacturing facility.” The prices for renewable electricity are negotiated individually between buyers and sellers and prices lean on wholesale market electricity costs with a market premium, mostly close to between RUB 2 and RUB 2.5 (between $0.026 and $0.033) per kWh.
The first agreements of this kind were signed in Russia in 2018 by companies that provide fast-moving consumer goods and the bank sector. The list of buyers also includes PepsiCo and French gas provider Air Liquide, which resorted to renewable energy for its facility in Tatarstan. Such buyers are represented on the wholesale market through power distribution suppliers.
According to Usachev, more bilateral agreements may be concluded in the future, as the Ministry of Energy has been working on a new law since December 2020 that would introduce low carbon certificates. “In the next months, the ministry should submit the draft law to the government,” he explained. “The good news is that this law will establish low carbon certificates for the first time.” Under these provisions, nuclear, solar, wind and hydropower will be entitled to compete for such certificates in public auctions.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Russian Federation had 1.42 GW of installed solar power at the end of 2020. Most of this capacity comes from large-scale PV plants installed under the country's auction scheme for renewables.
In order to support rooftop PV, the Russian government last month introduced a net metering scheme for solar and other renewable energy generators not exceeding 15 kW in size.

Manufacturer China Glass showcased the seller’s market that is solar panel glass yesterday, with a first-quarter update featuring sales returns 73% higher than those posted in January-to-March last year, despite shipping only 40% more products. China Glass sold RMB793 million (US$122 million) of goods in a three-month window which is typically low season for the industry but which was this time marked by “historical levels” for product price and the demand-to-supply ratio. The company also announced plans to invest RMB142 million into 71% ownership of a joint venture with a government entity to establish a RMB200 million photovoltaic ultra-white rolled glass production base at Suqian High-Tech Industry Development Zone. Under the terms of the agreement, counterpart Suqian Bochen can require China Glass to buy out its stake after three years of operation.
Wafer producer Zhonghuan Semiconductor has approved a capital increase of US$36 million to acquire a stake in Singapore-based solar module maker Maxeon Solar Technologies. The Chinese manufacturer will purchase 1.87 million new shares to be issued by Maxeon, through Zhonghuan's Singaporean subsidiary. Maxeon's largest shareholder is French energy company Total.
Solar cell manufacturer Tongwei raised its prices last week. Multicrystalline 157mm cells now cost RMB0.70 per watt (US$0.11), for an increase of RMB0.07. Mono PERC 158.75mm ‘M2' cells will cost RMB0.96 per watt, RMB0.02 higher than in the previous weeks. Mono PERC 166mm M6 cells are priced at RMB0.89 per watt, up from RMB0.86.

UK-based Power Roll has announced an agreement with Thermax Group, a Pune-headquartered energy and environment solutions provider, to develop the market for its lightweight, flexible solar film in India.
Power Roll claims its solar film technology can produce up to 20 times cheaper electricity than existing flexible PV and is on track to deliver the lowest levelized cost of electricity for any solar technology. The film is 25 times lighter than silicon PV and has a 20 times smaller carbon footprint. 
The film can be manufactured using high-speed roll-to-roll production processes, which eliminate many costly process steps typical of other solar photovoltaic technologies.
Power Roll views India as one of the most strategic markets for its technology and has therefore set up a business operation in the country to support regional growth.
As per the agreement, Power Roll will collaborate with Thermax to assess the market potential for scale manufacturing and deployment of its unique solar film in India. The two companies will jointly identify applications for lightweight solar film and green energy solutions for the region. Over the agreement period, the parties will share knowledge on the low-cost production processes, efficiency and identify compelling use cases for solar film in India. 
A successful conclusion to the agreement will see Thermax become a licensee of Power Roll’s technology for commercial manufacture and sale of solar film in India, read the company statement.
Opportunity
Power Roll CEO Neil Spann sees a huge potential for the company's solar film in India and views Thermax as an ideal manufacturing partner to cater to the market.
“Thermax has the right mix of renewable energy and manufacturing expertise, as well as the size and scale, to be a successful manufacturing partner in India. Our technology licensing model is perfectly aligned with the country’s ‘Make in India’ self-reliant strategy and world-leading ambition to deploy 280 GW of solar energy by 2030,” Spann said.
Thermax’s business portfolio includes heating, cooling, water and waste management, and specialty chemicals. The company also designs, builds, and commissions turnkey solar power plants, both rooftop and ground-mounted.
Power Roll’s lightweight solar film and disruptive price point will expand the range of applications for solar energy. By applying different coatings to its versatile microgroove design, the film can also be used for energy storage and to manufacture capacitors.
“We look forward to this partnership as a lever to increase the adoption of solar technology for a variety of applications in line with India’s ambitious renewable energy targets,” said Thermax MD and CEO Ashish Bhandari.
The agreement with Thermax follows Power Roll’s recent partnership with one of Japan’s leading energy companies to establish the market potential and use cases for solar film in Japan.

The company published an extract from the overdue figures as part of an update to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange yesterday which attempted to explain the financial issue which is holding up the accounts.
According to the extract from the unaudited figures, revenue slumped last year to RMB14.6 billion, from the RMB19.2 billion posted in 2019. The published numbers included an, as yet unexplained ‘other gains and losses' column which ballooned from a RMB1.06 billion (US$163 million) plus in 2019 to a RMB4.99 billion reverse last year. Elsewhere, the money owed by GCL to other companies for non-trade-related matters rose from RMB555 million to RMB1.87 billion (US$288 million) and the figures for notes payable within a year also escalated, from RMB422 million (US$64.9 million), in 2019, to RMB3.31 billion.
That added up to the anticipated big annual loss, which followed a RMB110 million (US$16.9 million) profit in 2019.
Shareholders will have to wait for publication of the finalized accounts to learn more details because auditor Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu wants more details about “a commercial bill payable no later than October,” received by GCL subsidiary Jiangsu Zhongneng Polysilicon Technology Development Co Ltd. It is a curious way to describe the payment as it appears the RMB460 million figure involved may actually be payable as a refund to the GCL unit after Jiangsu Zhongneng made a pre-payment of RMB510 million in September 2019 to a contractor, for a “silicon material production project,” which never materialized.
With Covid-19 reportedly delaying plans for the production facility in Xuzhou Economic Development Zone, in Jiangsu province, GCL yesterday said its subsidiary had started talks to terminate the contract in October and entered a termination agreement earlier this month, subsequently receiving the “commercial bill payable no later than October.”
GCL has, as yet, made no announcement of the progress of a planned debt restructure which involves issuing new senior notes to replace US$500 million of investments which went unpaid at the end of January, triggering a RMB4.54 billion cross-default. GCL had previously said it hoped to submit the plan to the Court of Bermuda, where it is registered for tax reasons, by the middle of this month.

The proposed model was conceived for an energy system based exclusively on wind and solar power generation coupled with a mix of pumped hydro and battery storage. It was utilized to analyze the economic feasibility of a similar system in Ometepe, which is an island formed by two volcanoes rising out of Lake Nicaragua in Nicaragua.
Image: wikimedia commons, https://bit.ly/2QF0f7E
The island was chosen as it is rich in wind and solar resources and has a crater lake at the top of an extinct volcano that can be used as the upper reservoir of a pumped-hydro storage facility, and is located in a tropical freshwater lake that could act as the lower reservoir. The pumped hydro unit is expected to provide most of the storage operations and the battery bank is used only if the upper reservoir is full or is not able to operate.
The scientists explained that, in order to identify the optimal installed capacity of the proposed off-grid renewable energy system, the cost of energy (COE) must be optimized while ensuring a reliable power supply. The optimization process is implemented through an algorithm called Multi-objective Grey Wolf Optimize, which is a kind of algorithm mimicking the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of gray wolves in nature. “Since this project aims at increasing renewable energy penetration, only solutions that achieved at least a 95% level of power supply reliability are adopted,” they explained. “In this regard, the model applies a penalty factor to low-reliability solutions.”
The system’s long term performance was analyzed through an hourly time-step simulation over 13 consecutive years, from 2007 to 2019.
The researchers found that the island's total electricity demand can be met with a COE of €0.095/kWh for a power supply reliability of 97.5%. Furthermore, they found that for a 99% level of power supply reliability, the achieved COE was €0.081/kWh; and for 100% reliability, it was €0.067/kWh. “This range of values aligns with the observed behavior for COE in Nicaragua in 2020,” they stated, noting that solar should represent around 70% of the system's installed capacity.
“The sensitivity analysis conducted for different combinations of capex and loss of power supply probability (LPSP) estimated that the COE ranges between €0.047/kWh and €0.095/kWh, based on international reference capex values,” they concluded.
The study, published in Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments, also considered the possibility of producing green hydrogen from surplus wind and solar power, but the construction of an electrolyzer of 5 MW, which was the minimum size required, was found to be difficult to implement.
The research team included scientists from Universidad de la Costa, in Colombia, AGH University in Poland, the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, and the Mostaganem University, in Algeria.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/20/no-bifacial-solar-in-west-africa-thats-likely-to-change-soon/,"EMPLOYMENT,FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INVERTERS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RACKING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH AFRICA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA",COSMAS MWIRIGI,"APRIL 20, 2021",No bifacial solar in West Africa? That’s likely to change soon,"A webinar about technological developments in the PV industry has presented mixed views about the prospects of bifacial solar projects in Africa.
Maxime Bureau, chief operating officer of French developer Africa Ren, told the event – organized by trade body the Africa Solar Industry Association (AFSIA) – she understood no bifacial projects have yet been installed in West Africa, because lenders feel the technology is not sufficiently mature.
However Emeka Wosu, global business development manager for Chinese manufacturer Longi Solar, said the technology is fast gaining ground on the continent, following a pattern observed in other global markets. “In 2019, bifacial projects represented around 14% of the global market and in a year or so, we expect it to hit the 50% mark,” said Wosu. “So, this technology is growing significantly. For instance, nearly all the projects in South Africa are now going bifacial.”
Anthony Erasmus, advisory account manager for Huawei South Africa agreed, and said: “A significant portion of upcoming pipelines, not only in Africa but all across the world, is now bifacial. This is a trend we've seen from the past year or so, and projects that were originally designed to be monofacial are now shifting or adding more bifacial modules. And since you cannot install bifacial modules on fixed systems, the use of trackers is growing significantly.”
Erasmus highlighted the importance of security and privacy in PV projects among the key tech trends likely to emerge up to 2025 and the Huawei representative appeared to cast doubt on the employment benefits of the energy transition by predicting 80% of PV project operations and processes – from panel inspection to cleaning – are likely to be automated by that date. That opinion conflicts with the many reports published by renewable energy advocates about the job creation benefits solar could offer in areas likely to suffer widespread unemployment as a result of the exit from coal-fired power.
With the deployment of artificial intelligence technology by companies such as Chinese telecoms company Huawei enabling ongoing, autonomous improvement of PV systems, Erasmus also predicted increasingly flexible, smart solar projects would switch from being ‘grid-following' infrastructure to a grid-supporting role.
The account manager also forecast inverter makers, including his employer, would use the rapid development of new materials – as well as heat dissipation and engineering technologies – to ramp up the power density of their products by the middle of the decade, further reducing the levelized cost of energy produced by solar plants.
The pros and cons of the new generation of large, high-output solar modules were among the subjects discussed at the AFSIA event, with Francisco Estela – technical director of global business development at Longi – extolling the benefits of his company's Hi-MO5 ultra-high-power product.
The Hi-MO5 features 182mm wafers and Estela told the webinar his company's product had a more mature design than 210mm-wafer-based modules. The Longi representative said products based on the larger wafers pose a high failure risk due to a low safety margin of 1%, and claimed the 182mm Hi-MO5, with its single diode, has better junction temperature and thermal runaway properties than 166mm-wafer-based alternatives.
The main selling point of the slew of physically larger, high-powered solar modules which emerged out of China last year, said Estela, is that reducing the number of panels needed to generate a fixed volume of electricity reduces balance-of-system project costs including installation and construction, cable wiring, and tracker construction.
Hemanshu Sugandhi, director of business development at U.S. solar tracker company Nextracker, discussed the importance of data to the cost-effective maintenance of large scale solar projects.
Projects should feature a strategy to capture, monitor and use data, which can inform module location and analyze irradiance and tracker-angle heat maps, said Sugandhi. For example, Flex-owned Nextracker, he said, collects “more than 13” data points from the 350,000 or so trackers it has hooked up to its data management system around the world, every five minutes. “There's a lot of data we get and we use machine learning algorithms to figure [out] trends and digital signatures, which allows us to analyze what's happening in the field and take the necessary actions to avoid potential issues,” added Sugandhi.
With the most advanced trackers able to predict the speed, direction and duration of storms, the Nextracker director said, considering prevailing wind site conditions can increase module stability and reduce micro-cracking and pressure on the panels.
Africa Ren's Bureau, who had remarked upon the absence of bifacial facilities in West Africa, said similar concerns about tech maturity ensured the promise offered by floating solar is yet to be realized across the continent.
With string inverters and energy storage among the other new technologies available to African developers – and trackers gaining popularity in markets further from the equator – Bureau said reliability statistics and warranties are helping drive the roll-out of high-powered modules across the continent.
That was a point emphasized by Longi's Wosu too, who described such product guarantees as “necessary to ensure confidence and secure the financial backing from … lenders and IPPs [independent power producers].”

Each quarter, Seattle-based renewable energy trading company LevelTen Energy reports the prices that wind and solar project developers have offered for the power purchase agreements (PPAs) available on the LevelTen Marketplace.
In the first quarter of 2021, the company analyzed data for 355 power purchase agreements from 138 renewable energy projects in 16 European countries and noted that the result had been largely characterized by the stability of PPA prices.
The biggest changes occurred in France, where prices fell by 5.5% compared to the previous quarter, while in Spain, they fell by 2.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020: from €35 / MWh in the fourth quarter of 2020 to €34 / MWh in the first quarter of 2021. In Germany, prices fell slightly by just 1%.
In the period from January to March, Italy continued to be the market with the highest percentage of offers from project developers in the LevelTen Marketplace, accounting for 31.3% of the total, while Spain continued to be the second biggest market with a 24.8% share. The United Kingdom became the third-largest market in Europe, and Germany was again the fourth market.
In Europe, the average duration of wind PPAs was 11.7 years, and that of solar ones, 11.9 years.
Among the current trends, the LevelTen points out that the European energy giants are turning green, as are the oil companies, and mentions the participation of Total in the Spanish auction in association with Ignis; the signing of a PPA between Shell and Solaria; Eni‘s entry into the Spanish photovoltaic market by acquiring 160 MW in three X-Elio facilities; and the signing of the PPA between Repsol and Microsoft.
The demand for PPAs continues to increase in Spain. According to the European platform RE-Source, “of the almost 4 GW of PPAs signed in 12 countries last year, Spain was responsible for more than 1.3 GW, around a third of the total announced”. German consultancy Aurora Energy Research indicates that the demand for PPAs in Spain will be about 31 TWh per year in 2030.
“Before the announcement of the auction, one of the main risks for the Spanish PPA market was that the excess supply would lead to very low prices of the agreements,” stated Aurora. “However, as the projects participating in the auction cannot sign bilateral contracts, the supply of projects built to sign corporate PPAs is reduced.” According to the company, with at least 19.5 GW auctioned and therefore withdrawn from the PPA market, the renewable energy supply for the PPA market is closer to 29 TWh, which is quite balanced with demand.
While the auction helps fund large projects, PPAs will play a particularly important role for smaller developers, or those simply looking to diversify their purchasing portfolio.
The Spanish market for PPAs will continue to be an important source of financing for many renewable energy developers, according to LevelTen Energy. Rising CO2 and gas prices and a greater appetite for green energy will drive demand for PPAs. “Similarly, diversification of risk and strategies will lead many developers to seek private PPA contracts as a way to finance debt,” it added. “Therefore, it is probable that the coexistence of government auctions with a fluid PPA market will continue in the immediate future in the Spanish market.”
“It is possible that, as the Spanish solar industry continues to boom and competition intensifies both for auction awards and PPA purchase agreements, Spain is on its way to becoming the European market with the lowest prices of solar PPAs,” said Flemming Sørensen, vice president for Europe at LevelTen Energy.
“I don't think the recent auction prices will set a new short-term benchmark for PPA prices in Spain,” he explained. “However, it is clear that Spain remains an attractive and competitive market with a huge solar development portfolio, so I would expect PPA prices to continue to decline slightly in the future.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/20/we-all-trust-the-pv-performance-ratio-test-but-should-we/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"APRIL 20, 2021",We all trust the PV performance ratio test – but should we?,"From pv magazine 04/2021
For an EPC to successfully achieve provisional acceptance certification (PAC), they must demonstrate, among other things, that the project’s performance ratio (PR) meets or exceeds a guaranteed value as defined in the EPC contract. To do so, the EPC contractor performs a PR test according to the rules defined in the contract, with the test often witnessed by the owner.
Both the EPC and owner are keen to successfully achieve PAC as quickly as possible, and it is often the case that the test happens within pressured contractual circumstances. For the EPC, a successful PR test means they have met important contractual expectations and liabilities. For the owner, it means the project moves into the operational phase and starts generating revenue in line with the investment assumptions.
If the project fails to meet these contractual requirements, the EPC contractor will need to spend time checking and making good the works (if needed). Eventually they will repeat the test, prolonging the construction timeline and increasing the probability of becoming liable for liquidated damages for delay. As one might expect, PR tests are incredibly important and at the core of the interface between the EPC and owner.
As a technical adviser, we have sometimes been surprised when projects we feel are “good” – which is to say they are well conceived, equipped with good quality components, and executed following high-quality standards – end up failing the PR test. This has led us to wonder whether we can really trust these tests, and if not, if we should be particularly skeptical or cautious.
What we call “good projects” in the continuation of this article are those solar plants we have previously assessed and inspected and which, based on the experience accumulated, we would have expected to be able to pass the PR test with a robust consistency.
We decided to conduct an independent analysis to answer two questions. How likely is it that “good projects” might fail the PR test? And what is the optimum combination of correction factors and duration to ensure that the test is truly representative of the quality of the project, with a 95% level of confidence?
To answer these questions, Everoze took one year of high-quality operational data from 10 projects which have been previously assessed in detail and are performing well. The projects are located in diverse climates (U.K., France, and the Netherlands), thus enabling an assessment of the impact of different calculation methods in different conditions. The aim of the analysis is to understand how the probability that a plant passes or fails the test varies with the test procedure.
The study used real-world operational data to remove any uncertainties typical of methodologies adopting software simulation. A reduction of the operational PR values by a certain percentage (3%, 4%, and 5%), in line with typical contractual practice, was instead adopted to determine the guaranteed PR values. Four test durations were analyzed: periods of four, seven, 11, and 16 days. Thus, considering a moving period for the test, a total of 362 four-day tests can be theoretically performed in a single year, so 350 16-day tests could be also extrapolated from a 365-day total data period. However, as the data was cleaned in advance to remove any unavailability – and other periods not considered representative of the “good project” normal operation – the total number of available days for the testing period was reduced to 348.
The test was considered passed (a true positive) if the measured and corrected PR (PAC PR) was above the “guaranteed PR.” The number of passed tests is then divided by the total number of tests undergone to obtain the percentage of true positives. The remaining percentage (false negatives) shows how likely it is that “good projects” fail the PR test. By changing the combination of test duration and correction factors applied to the calculation of the PR, we can identify the test formula that delivers a 95% level of confidence, providing comfort that the test is representative of the quality of a project.

Our first results show that monthly correction factors and temperature correction greatly improves the reliability of the test. The results of the analysis show that, when using no correction factors, even “good” projects have only a 77% probability of passing the test. Interestingly, applying the temperature correction alone reduces the precision of the test (less projects pass the test). This is only true for assets that have a lower PR in winter due to shading, which is the case for the majority of the assets considered in the study. The reason is that in winter, a significant proportion of the energy is produced below the 25 C module temperature, leading to a further decrease of the PR when corrected to 25 C.
Using monthly PR correction factors increases instead the probability of a “good” project passing the test to 94%.
Our data shows that one in 10 good projects will fail a four-day test. Taking reasonable commercial assumptions (a 4% reduction in the measured yearly PR to derive the guaranteed PR – 4% guarantee scenario, chart above right) and adopting the monthly correction factor methodology (MCF), then about one in 10 “good projects” fails a four-day test. This is a significant proportion that leads to costly delays due to the need to rerun the test, and wasted effort in searching for a problem that may not even exist.
The pass probability increases with the duration of the test, with 11 days providing 95% confidence that “good projects” will succeed. On average, confidence increases 0.5% per day of test duration.
But what if the contractual conditions are tougher and there is only a 3% reduction of the estimated PR to determine the guaranteed PR (3% guarantee scenario, above right)? In this scenario, even with a 16-day test duration, one in 10 good projects fail the test. Best practice cannot remove the risk of false negatives, and sometimes particular meteorological conditions deviate from the average ones considered in the monthly correction, introducing biases in the long-duration tests.
Based on this analysis, Everoze recommends that developers and owners carefully consider the PR test formula within their EPC contracts. Adopting monthly correction factors and temperature correction does not always result in the expected outcome, and this should be factored into the execution timeline to allow float for repetition of the test.
Everoze appreciates that a longer test duration may impact the project’s commercial value, but we believe that if this is correctly planned into development timelines, then there should be limited impact on returns to the benefit of greater certainty in passing the test.

This is the main conclusion of the study “Partial shading by solar panels delays bloom, increases floral abundance during the late-season for pollinators in a dryland, agrivoltaic ecosystem,” recently published in scientific reports, in which scientists from the Oregon State University in the U.S. have investigated if coupling PV with the habitat for wild and managed pollinators can help increase biodiversity and agricultural health.
“Some states, such as Minnesota, North Carolina, Maryland, Vermont, and Virginia, have developed statewide guidelines and incentives to promote pollinator-focused solar installations,” the scientists state. “In this practice, forage for pollinators is established as the solar array’s understory rather than the traditional turf grass or gravel.”

Their work began from the assumption that the panel's partial shading is able to create a microclimate that favors the abundant growth of more varied flowers and pollinators compared to plots with no shade, particularly during summer months. Their measurements were taken at a 10 MW solar plant located on an 18 hectare surface in Jackson County, Oregon.
The project site was previously utilized for cattle grazing and hosts vegetation such as non-native rhizomatous grasses and non-native forbs. “By nature of the installation process, some surface vegetation was removed, and surface soils were disturbed in areas where solar panels were installed,” the paper notes. “After installation, the site was prepared for restoration with native plants.” In 2018, native forbs and grasses were planted with the aim of creating an ideal habitat for both pollinators.
Data on pollinator and plant populations were collected seven times each over two-day periods in 2019 during July, August, and September. The analysis considered full shade areas with only 5% of sunlight, partial shade plots with 75% of sunlight, and portions with 100% of sunlight. The academics collected data from net radiation, air temperature, and relative humidity at 15-minute intervals at a height of 1.4 m.
Insect specimens were collected to inventory pollinating insect composition in plots. “Our unreplicated climate observations showed that solar panel shading alters the solar radiation, soil temperature, soil moisture, and vapor pressure deficit across treatments,” the US group stated. “Full shade plots experienced reduced further soil temperature and when compared to both full sun and partial shade plots.”
Floral abundance was found to be more abundant in partial shade plots, where around 4% more blooms were reported compared to both full sun and full shade plots. 342 pollinating insects representing 65 different species were collected, including native bees (45%) flies (20%), honey bees (12%), beetles (12%), wasps (7%), and others (3%). Insect species abundance was found to be higher in partial shade and full sun than in full shade.
“At our site, partial shading by solar panels increased bloom abundance by delaying bloom timing, increasing forage for pollinators during the hot, dry, late season — a time when nutrition is particularly important,” the scientists concluded, adding that this positive outcome should be the results of a series of factors including photoperiodicity, photosynthetic efficiency, a decrease in soil temperature and moisture on germination, and root establishment.
“Unused or underutilized lands below solar panels represent an opportunity to augment the expected decline of pollinator habitat,” said research co-author Maggie Graham. “Near agricultural lands, this also has the potential to benefit the surrounding agricultural community and presents an avenue for future study.”
In previous research, the same research group had developed a model to assess the overlap between solar potential and underlying land use. The researchers concluded that croplands, grasslands, and wetlands are the top three land classes for PV projects linked to agricultural activities, while barren terrain, traditionally prioritized for solar PV system installation, ranked fifth.
In another paper, the Oregon State University group stated that using land for both solar photovoltaic power and agriculture could provide 20% of total electricity generation in the United States.

French renewable energy company Total Eren, which is 30% owned by France-based multinational oil and gas company Total, has signed a binding memorandum of understanding with Western Australia company Province Resources, agreeing to complete a scoping study which could potentially lead to each company holding a 50% stake in the proposed HyEnergy Zero Carbon Hydrogen project.
The agreement marks a big step for Province, which originated as a gold and nickel exploration company and has only just entered the renewable energy game. Despite the excitement around its proposed HyEnergy project, which initially proposed installing 1 GW of hybrid solar and wind capacity to produce 60,000 tons of green hydrogen per year, the company could hardly be considered a major player.
The backing of Total Eren, however, changes the game entirely. Total Eren has 3.3 GW of global renewable energy power plants around the world, and successfully developed, financed and constructed Victoria’s largest solar farm, the Kiamal Solar Farm. It has a team of 20 renewable energy professionals in Australia.
Its support gives the HyEnergy project significantly more prowess, offering it far more robust financial backing and expertise. It has also seen ambition skyrocket, with the two companies now saying they plan to install 8 GW of renewable energy at the Gascoyne site.
The deal will see the companies perform a feasibility study for the hydrogen project, with the pair aiming to execute definitive agreements within four months.
Each company will bear its own costs during the development stage, and if they decide to move forward with the partnership, each will have a 50% stake in the project. In which case, the development of the integrated hybrid renewable energy capacity would be led by Total Eren, and will take place in two stages.
The involvement of Total Eren will also likely de-risk the project, which is Province Resources first foray into the world of utility-scale green energy.
Fabienne Demol, Executive Vice-President and Global Head of Business Development of Total Eren, said the company is pleased to partner with Province on its “ambitious” project, highlighting its potential significance.
“This new step demonstrates our strong commitment to the Australian market towards the decarbonization of the country and is also a concrete opportunity to kick off our Hydrogen strategy worldwide,” she stated. “After solar, wind, and storage, we believe Hydrogen is the next step of growth of renewable energies. We are determined to leverage our development and technical skills to make our first of several Hydrogen Projects in Australia a success.”
Earlier this month, Province announced it had applied for additional 864 square kilometers of tenure for the HyEnergy project, in addition to the 2,272 square kilometers it is securing in Gascoyne. The region of Gascoyne was selected in part because of its infrastructure, which includes the Dampier Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline and the North West Coastal Highway.
It also has considerable wind speeds and solar exposure. Province has appointed Sydney-based technology company Fulcrum3D to collect preliminary wind and solar data every 10 minutes within the project area to further assess the natural resource potential. In March, Province also appointed multinational ERM to de-risk the project for the raft of necessary approvals.
The cracking pace of the project, which has seen Province’s share price increase by over 400% since February, is seeking to capitalize on Australia’s wave of hydrogen enthusiasm. As the company has noted, Western Australia’s Hydrogen Strategy has devoted AUD10 million ($7.7 million) worth of funding to green hydrogen, while the Australian Renewable Energy Agency has earmarked AUD70 million and the Australian Government’s Advancing Hydrogen Fund has set aside AUD300 million.
“Given the recent drive by state and federal governments to quickly develop and advance the green hydrogen industry in Australia, I am confident this project will be of strategic national importance,” Province Resource’s Managing Director, David Frances, said.
“Management is excited to have a global renewable energy leader such as Total Eren as a partner with the technical and financial capability to help Province deliver this project as part of the backbone of the nation’s hydrogen strategy.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/20/us-start-up-secures-distribution-agreement-for-nickel-hydrogen-battery-technology/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,HONG KONG,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 20, 2021",US start-up secures distribution agreement for nickel-hydrogen battery technology,"From pv magazine USA
EnerVenue, a nickel-hydrogen battery startup that launched at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic last summer, has signed a distribution agreement with Towngas, Hong Kong’s first public utility and one of the largest energy suppliers in greater China.
Just after the company’s launch, CEO Jorg Heinmann outlined how finding large, anchor customers like Towngas quickly would be paramount to the company’s success. With this first major goal realized, pv magazine invited Heinmann to discuss how his California-based company has evolved in its first year.
“We know the technology works,” he said, adding that much of the underlying tech risk has been addressed. Engineering and operational challenges remain to be overcome in order to scale up manufacturing, “but we’re way out of the ‘science project’ mode,” he said,
Part of the science project was finding a way to cut battery costs. Nickel-hydrogen has proven to be a powerful energy storage technology for the aerospace industry for quite some time, but has always been held back from greater commercial use due to its high price.
Finding new materials to substitute for more costly traditional components was a breakthrough for EnerVenue, according to Heinmann. The costliest component to be replaced was platinum.
When theorizing about what expensive components could be replaced, Heinmann and the team expected to register a hit in battery performance. But the opposite has proven true, and Heinmann asserted that not only do the newly designed batteries perform significantly better than earlier versions, but they are being manufactured with “magnitudes” of cost reduction per battery.
Cost reduction and anchor customers like Towngas form the two prongs that Heinmann believes will help EnerVenue to overcome its biggest obstacle: the advantage of incumbent lithium-ion batteries. Although Heinmann declined to get into customer specifics, he said that the company is working on a number of projects to demonstrate their batteries on a large scale, as well as hammering out agreements for more anchor customers.
The Towngas deal represents a vote of confidence not just in nickel-hydrogen battery technology, but in EnerVenue as a company able to provide effective and cost-competitive storage solutions. It’s a confidence that Heinmann said he hopes will be recognized by other potential anchor customers that EnerVenue is pursuing.
As for meeting the product demand these large customers will bring, Heinmann said he is confident in his technology’s ability to scale.
“It’s designed for super-easy manufacturing and super-easy assembly,” Heinmann said. Expectations are that the manufacturing, tooling, and capital expenditure cost will be about one-fifth of that for equivalent lithium-ion capacity.
Heinmann credits the scale of the cost reduction to the simplicity of the battery itself, referring to it as a “stack of electrodes.” The design also makes possible features EnerVenue believes will give it an edge over lithium-ion in the long run: a 30,000+ cycle without degradation lifespan, an optimal operating temperature range from -40° to 60°C (-40 to 140°F), no fire or thermal runaway risk, no toxic materials, and easy recycling at the end of the battery’s life.
“We found a huge number of ways to get cost out of this thing, and that’s all engineering cost reduction,” said Heinmann. “That gives us huge confidence in achieving our business plan and scaling fast.”
