“The deal was closed recently,” FAS Energy Solar CEO, Marcus H. Schrauf, told pv magazine. “I see our work at FAS Energy as directly implementing the call for action at COP28 of tripling renewable energy capacity. We deliver what the parties request. We are supporting the creation of a market here in Saudi Arabia and we encourage industry participants to follow suit.”

The off-taker is Cenomi Centers, which is the largest owner and operator of shopping malls in the country.
The project will be built in multiple locations spread across Saudi Arabia and will consist of both rooftop and carport arrays. “Each of the systems will sell power to Cenomi through an individual PPA,” Schrauf Explained, noting that cities such as Jeddah, Riyadh, Khobar, Medina, and Mecca are included among the selected locations.
FAS Energy and Marubeni will own and operate the solar facilities through a 50%-50% joint venture. “We still haven’t finalized the selection of contractors and module and inverter procurement,” Schrauf added. “But that is going to happen in early 2024.”
Although the two companies didn’t disclose the financial terms and purchase price of the PPAs, Schrauf explained that the agreed price is slightly below current energy prices in Saudi Arabia.
“But is guaranteed for 20 years, which enables companies to make corporate and financial planning,” he said. “That's exactly the rationale for a lot of clients that we've seen globally. They want to be able to forecast their electricity pricing.”
The CEO also stressed that, despite the relatively low prices of the Saudi energy market, there are a lot of very positive mitigating factors. “The first and foremost the high irradiation that you have here in Saudi Arabia,” he said. “And if you add to that economies of scale, as we did with this project portfolio, you can achieve a significantly low LCOE, also in C&I projects.”

RenewSys has developed India’s first POE encapsulant for n-type TOPCon PV cells.
The manufacturer said its encapsulant, Conserv E–NT, contains a free radical scavenger that effectively shields TOPCon cells from irreversible damage caused by free radicals generated during day-to-day PV module operations. Some common causes of these attacks include fluctuating temperatures, high heat, water ingress, and chemicals from other components of the module.
Conserv E-NT features a wider lamination processing window, allowing for a larger range of acceptable operating conditions during lamination. This directly translates to increased throughput and higher productivity in module manufacturing plants by minimizing module rejections due to lamination issues.
Conserv E-NT is compatible with both one-side and two-side heat laminators. Its use in glass-glass TOPCon PV modules renders the modules bubble-free. The encapsulant also effectively restricts string shifting, a long-standing challenge in module production. These factors further contribute to a reduction in module rejection rates, ensuring a streamlined and efficient manufacturing process, said RenewSys.
Conserv E-NT suits both glass-glass and glass-backsheet n-type TOPCon solar modules.
“This encapsulant will help manufacturers reap many rewards as more and more Indian Module manufacturers introduce their TOPCon offerings,” said Avinash Hiranandani, vice chairman and managing director of RenewSys. “It also ensures that deterioration of TOPCon modules in the field during day-to-day operations is prevented, providing confidence to end customers—homes and businesses adopting solar power.”
RenewSys is an integrated PV module manufacturer with 2.5 GW of panel production capacity, 6 GW of encapsulants, 4 GW of backsheets, and 130 MW of PV cells. It has produced and supplied more than 22 GW of encapsulants and backsheets throughout the world.
RenewSys is the renewable energy unit of Enpee Group.

The York Cyk heat pump is designed for high-head conditions and can reportedly deliver high-temperature hot water as high as 77 C.
“The York Cyk can reduce water and operational costs by as much as 50% when compared to traditional boiler and chiller applications,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The new product is currently available in a small version with a 400-ton cooling capacity. It offers 1,406 kW if output for cooling and 2,051 kW for heating.
The company said the system has a combined coefficient of performance of 4.9. It may use either the R-1234ze or the R-515b refrigerants, which Johnson Controls said have ultra-low global warming potential (GWP).
The heat pump also features two electric motor-driven centrifugal compressors arranged in series and double bundle condenser technology that can cope with unbalanced load conditions, according to the company.
“The innovative design is compatible with existing high-temperature hot water heating systems, eliminating the need to replace air handlers and terminal heating devices, which is often required to accommodate the lower water temperatures associated with other heat pump products,” said the company.
Johnson Controls plans to launch a second version of the heat pump with a 2,000-ton cooling capacity and an output of 7,033 kW at an unspecified later stage.
“The York Cyk heat pump is ideal for medium to large commercial buildings, university campuses, hospitals, industrial processes and district energy applications and can be used in new building or retrofit applications,” it said.

Almost 2 GW of solar was tendered in the latest UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero auction round while almost 500 MW was recently awarded in the latest auction round spearheaded by Irish power transmission operator EirGrid. However, senior PSC consultant Grant McCormick and technical director Chris Smith said a range of improvements need to be made – from regulation to project rollout – to ensure the 2.5 GW gets connected.
Issues include the ever-changing “complexity” of the UK’s Grid Code compliance requirements, requiring developers to be “agile and understand which changes are relevant,” according to their report. This could be solved by hiring a compliance manager experienced in Grid Code regulation, and developers should ensure their engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor is well-resourced and has “agility.”
Developers should also engage with key elements of the supply chain, such as providing detailed simulation models in a specific software application. This would provide evidence that the model is “validated via factory acceptance tests or third-party testing” – not “trivial” matters for suppliers, they said.
Another fix could be more power system simulation modeling. “The various components that consist of the solar farm – the inverter, power park controller, transformer, and cabling, for instance – need to be modeled as a system against the performance requirements in the respective grid codes,” according to the analysis.
“For timely project delivery, developers must ensure compliance management is established as a key workstream starting from the earliest development phases and carrying on through to project delivery… Working with the right partner in the field can minimize costly delays to the start of operations.”
Last month the Irish government said it expected to install 8 GW of solar by the end of 2023  – a commitment made last year in the “Climate Action Plan 2023.” According to UK government data published in September, there was almost 15 GW of solar PV installed as of June.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/22/aesolar-teams-up-with-fraunhofer-csp-for-shade-resistant-pv-module-research/,"SPONSORED,EUROPE,GERMANY",,"DECEMBER 22, 2023",AESOLAR teams up with Fraunhofer CSP for shade-resistant PV module research,"Renewable energy goals in Europe require significant increases in renewable energy deployment. Rooftop installations have dominated other applications in Europe, with about 60% of the market share in 2022. Germany is the biggest market in the region with respect to total installation capacity, with over 42 GW of PV on rooftops by the end of 2021. The Netherlands, as the country with highest installation capacity per capita in Europe, has over 80% of the installations on small rooftops. Such data shows the importance of the Rooftop segment in PV market.
One of the biggest challenges for rooftop PV modules is partial shading due to obstacles such as trees, chimneys, or parapets. Nearby structures, dust and snow are also a frequent contributor to the issue. Partial shading leads to a significant power loss in module level, and it leads to mismatches at the module level as well as between modules connected in a string. The power loss due to partial shading is highly dependent on the module design, shading pattern, and shading orientation.  While power optimizers can optimize the losses from mismatch, they cannot save the affected string or PV module and they increase the investment volume.  Furthermore, active electronic devices are shown to have a lower lifetime compared to passive components like PV modules.
To overcome the shading challenges of rooftop modules, AESOLAR developed a shade-resistant PV module with integrated bypass diodes for each individual solar cell. The module can produce up to 80% more energy than traditional modules under partial shading conditions. The AESOLAR module utilizes full-size solar cells for the design and is independent from shading orientation. The module has received the top innovation award from pv magazine in 2018.
To further develop this technology, AESOLAR is collaborating with Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics (CSP) to develop a new generation of shade-resistant PV modules using half-cut cells. The collaboration is being conducted under a SegmentPV research project and is funded by Germany’s Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz). The project started in May 2023 and entails two years of research work. “Within the project, module components, designs, and prototypes created by AESOLAR will be tested by Fraunhofer CSP to achieve a higher energy yield, better shading tolerance, and superb reliability for an innovative product that tackles one of the biggest challenges of rooftop PV,” says Dr. Hamed Hanifi, Director of Research and Development at AE Solar and coordinator of the SegmentPV project.

As many cultures around the world prepare for a holiday season, the Solcast team has run a long-term analysis on historical average irradiance on Christmas day, and a look ahead at the forecasts for Europe and the US, using data from the Solcast API.
Christmas Day is just a few days after the Solstice, when the day is at its longest in the southern hemisphere and shortest in the northern hemisphere. This is the driving factor in the long-term average irradiance trends, where you can see much lower levels of total irradiance in the northern hemisphere.

Whilst the amount of irradiance available is based on the length of the day, long-term cloud patterns are also present in the data, which you can see on the western coasts of South America, Africa and Australia. Sub-tropical latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere see more
easterly winds as the sub-tropical ridge pushes further south, keeping moisture offshore on the west coast and bringing more moisture and cloud to the east coasts.
 
This year, much of the eastern US will receive below-average irradiance over Christmas, as an eastward-tracking low-pressure system brings rain and snow across the continent. However, the system likely won’t make it to the northeastern USA during the daytime,
leaving New England to see above-average irradiance. A high-pressure system following the rain and snow will bring sun to the Midwest and West Coast of the US, delivering average to above-average irradiance for the day.


Europe will see more variation than the US compared to long-term averages. Low-pressure systems in the North Sea will push westerly winds and Atlantic moisture across the British Isles, northern France and Germany. Further south, light winds and a high-pressure system
will keep skies clearer and sunnier than usual. This will feel like a typical December day, as the Mediterranean coast has relatively less cloudy winters than further north.

Particularly noticeable in the long-term average is the difference between Spain and Southern France, as the Pyrenees mountain range shields the Iberian peninsula from moist and cold northerly winds.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

Trina Solar has announced the formation of the 700 W+ Photovoltaic Open Innovation Ecological Alliance. The group – which also includes Astronergy, Canadian Solar, Risen Energy, TCL Zhonghuan and Tongwei – plans to standardize the design of solar modules above 700 W in size.
The alliance calls for module manufacturers adhere to existing agreed industry dimensions of 2,384 mm by 1,303 mm. A hole distance of 790 mm has been added to the standard. This builds on the T/CPIA 0003-2022 Technical Specification issued by the China Photovoltaic Industry Association.
In recent years, the power output of solar modules has jumped from 500 W to 700 W, and the size of modules have increased along with the wattage. In 2021, for example, Risen Energy released the 132-cell NewT@N panel based on 210 mm n-type monocrystalline multi busbars cells with a half-cut design. The high-wattage module size conforms to the recommended standard of 2,384 mm x 1,303 mm x 35 mm.
Having large modules presents some challenges in terms of weight on a roof, and ease of mounting on trackers or racking. But a lack of standardization presents several challenges, not only in production, but in fitting to infrastructure.
The 700W+ alliance sees standardization as a way of reducing balance of system costs while also cutting the levelized cost of electricity. Ultimately, standardization will enhance supply chain efficiencies, boost production, and lower costs, the alliance claims.

Consulting firm Finergreen said that 14 developers won projects. French utility EDF led with 111.8 MW, or 22% of the total volume. This is mainly due to the 108 MW Elément Air Rattaché (EAR) solar plant in Chateaudun, which will be built on 83 hectares.
Neoen came second with 104 MW, broken down into four projects ranging from 14.4 MW to 30 MW, with commissioning to take place between 2025 and 2028. Three of the projects are agrivoltaic installations on farms.
BayWa re came third with 77 MW. It was followed by Urbasolar (44.4 MW), Enertrag (39.9 MW), Générale du Solaire (23 MW), Sipenr (22.3 MW), TotalEnergies (21.7 MW). Below 20 MW, projects were won by Corsica Sole, RWE (with 11 MW of wind and 4 MW of solar), Nouvergies, ib vogt, Voltalia, and Elements.
Finergreen reports a trend toward an evenly distributed allocation of ground-mounted solar projects, with the southernmost regions securing only 17% of the total capacity (87 MW). Centre-Val de Loire leads with 38% (193 MW), followed by Grand-Est with 14% (71 MW), and Hauts-de-France with 39.9 MW.

As solar power has been developed and popularized across the globe over the last several decades, the industry has given way to more recent innovation that allows for higher efficiency in irregular places: thin-film solar cells. These lightweight, flexible cells are capable of attachment to surfaces of nearly any shape or design, thanks to their flexibility, while requiring minimal structural supports, due to their light weight. With this technology, solar power is able to be harnessed in a variety of applications and places where previously thought impossible, due to the rigid structure and heavy nature of traditional solar panels.
And now, thin-film solar modules are ready to take on their next challenge: agrivoltaics.
As the impacts of climate change worsen each year, domestic farmers have begun to struggle to keep their crops healthy, as the sun beats down on them with punishingly-high temperatures. Thankfully, a new use of solar technology, known as agrivoltaics (APV), have come to help.
Farmers need elevated coverage to provide partial shade for their struggling crops and solar modules need ample space to soak in the sunlight to generate power. APV combines these two needs, by placing arrays of solar modules above areas of crop growth, to provide partial shade, which reduces sunburn on the land, reduces water evaporation, and insulates the crops from extreme cold and extreme heat, all while giving farmers the primary benefit of solar power utilization: a second revenue stream through power generation.
And now, thin-film solar PV is ready to supercharge this powerful relationship.
Current challenges facing agrivoltaics 
If you were to set up your agrivoltaic system with traditional, rigid solar panels, it’s possible you will run into some logistical issues. Traditional panels are quite heavy, requiring substantial support structures, and are so large that they provide more shade than necessary for most crops, and can stifle their health and growth. The goal of a balanced APV system is to provide just the right amount of shade that keeps the land from dehydration while also allowing the proper amount of sunlight to shine through and help the crops grow. Unfortunately, the rigid nature of traditional solar panels limits the ability to strike this delicate balance.
Most current APV installations that utilize rigid panels will typically consist of a row of solar panels next to a row of crops, taking about half of the land out of production, and make crop care and harvesting quite difficult. Heavy machinery employed in standard maintenance and harvesting processes often must be replaced by expensive manual labor to avoid damage to the solar system.
Lastly, the electrical conduit for traditional solar modules is installed underground; this disables flood irrigation and therefore can limit the variety of crops that are able to be grown in symbiosis with a traditional solar array. If only certain crops can work within the module, then it may end up not being a good fit for an otherwise interested farmer.
Key benefits of thin-film for agrivoltaics
In contrast with traditional panels, thin-film solar cells are much more adaptable to these agricultural situations, thanks to their flexible, lightweight design. Thin-film agrivoltaics overcome the challenges of their rigid, heavy counterparts by consisting of a series of solar crossbars covered in solar that are elevated high above the protected crops, which allows for:
Agrivoltaics, using thin-film solar technology, allow for the proper distribution of shade and sunlight onto the ground beneath it.
The use of thin-film solar cells also allows for greater energy savings, a healthier crop yield, and increased water savings.
Perhaps best of all, is the ability for thin-film modules to continue functioning after being struck, impaled or damaged. Climate change continues to bring about dangerous, unpredictable weather phenomena, where high winds carrying various items and debris is common. When a traditional solar cell suffers an impact, its glass coating is often shattered, creating a costly mess, the need for swift, expensive repair, and the total lack of energy production until it is properly fixed. But thin-film solar cells don’t have these same drawbacks; if a cell is punctured or damaged by outside forces, the rest of the cell will continue to function just fine, leaving only the small, damaged area in need of repair, rather than taking the whole array out of commission.
The future of thin-film for agrivoltaics
As more and more domestic farmers turn to agrivoltaics as a viable solution to increase revenues per acre, reduce on site energy costs and to bolster crop yields, we will start to see a greater embrace of thin-film solar to get the job done.
While there are plenty of applications and situations where large, traditional, rectangular solar panels are the optimal choice for solar power generation, agrivoltaics is an area that requires the flexible nature of thin-film solar technology to deftly handle the delicate relationship between crops and their need for shade and sunlight. Soon, farmers across the nation will begin to see not only the lucrative energy-saving benefits of thin-film agrivoltaics, but also the crop health benefits of it as well.

Prior to Ascent, Warley was president of Warley & Company LLC, a strategic advisory firm that provided executive management services, capital advisory, and M&A to middle-market companies in the service, construction, technology, oil & gas, clean energy, food, retail and green-building sectors.

SunPower suffered a share-price decline of more than 40% this week as it filed a quarterly earnings report that flagged its ability to remain a “going concern.”
The concern was sparked by a technical default on debts owed by the company. In October, SunPower announced it would restate third-quarter financial results due to an inventory reporting error with one of its subsidiaries. Being late with financial reporting placed SunPower in breach of key terms in several credit agreements, leaving the company exposed to lenders’ requests for immediate repayment.
In all, SunPower stated that this breach could lead to lenders demanding immediate payment of more than $65 million in debt, causing the company to express doubts about its ability to keep its operations running.
The company said it is currently trying to secure a waiver with the lenders, and without one, it may lack funds to support day-to-day operations.
On Dec. 8, the company received a similar waiver that saved it from technical default and provided it access to $75 million in funding. SunPower has until Jan. 19 to shore up finances or receive another waiver for the some $65 million in debt it is obligated to repay.
Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James, told Reuters that the company stands a good chance to secure a waiver, as it essentially resulted from a technical issue.
Roth Capital Partners said in an industry note that if SunPower fails to secure the waiver, it could lead to a “cascade” of cash flow challenges, leading to cash flow constraints for SunPower dealers.
The company has posted over $110 million in operational losses through three quarters this year. Residential solar has struggled industry-wide in the US. in 2023 due to the macroeconomic environment and critical policy changes.
High interest rates in particular have been a detriment to companies like SunPower, who rely on lending to offer their customers attractive long-term solar energy contracts.
Looking ahead
While hard times have hit US residential solar, Enphase co-founder Raghu Belur told pv magazine USA he believes 2024 will be “a year of recovery” for the industry. 
Belur pointed to the financial fundamentals of rooftop solar, storage and EV charging. Interest rates are eventually going to come down, and meanwhile, utility rates are rising far faster than inflation. This is particularly true in California, where the Public Utilities Commission approved a 13% bump to electric utility rates in 2024. Couple these changing forces with diving solar module prices, and suddenly the payback period looks strong, and demand recovers.
While solar and storage shoppers typically use a rule of thumb of about 3% to 4% annual rate increases from the utility company to estimate long-term savings, Belur said this assumption no longer applies. “Double-digit rate hikes are common now,” he said.
Belur recognized that it has been a difficult year for rooftop solar, but said he remains confident that financial fundamentals will win back customer demand. Under California’s NEM 3.0 policy, what used to be a four-to-five-year payback period, or return on investment, for rooftop solar, is now about seven to nine years.
“But you’re buying a 25-year asset, so you’re still coming out way ahead,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/22/fraunhofer-ise-develops-faster-laser-system-for-wafer-processing/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",MARIAN WILLUHN,"DECEMBER 22, 2023",Fraunhofer ISE develops faster laser system for wafer processing,"From pv magazine Germany
With a new type of laser, wafers can be processed 10 to 20 times faster than before. This is the result of a research project at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) in Germany.
The researchers developed a prototype that can engrave the finest structures in silicon wafers using UV waves. The new system concept enables solar cell manufacturers to carry out laser processing at the highest speed without having to compromise on the size of the structure or processing field.
In order to produce photovoltaic cells from wafers, the wafers must, among other things, be metalized. During this step, fine channels are furrowed on the top of the cells. The silver paste goes into the channels and then serves as a conductor track. The speed at which the channels come onto the wafer is very important for the production of cells to further reduce production costs.
The laser presented by Fraunhofer ISE can draw 1800 lines per second. This is 10 to 20 times as fast as a so-called galvanometer scanner, which is often used for this purpose. The laser has a high repetition rate of 10 megahertz and a maximum pulse energy of 5.6 microjoules.
The laser can also process wafers in M12 format with a side length of 210 millimeters. The channels engraved by the laser are just 15 micrometers wide. This is 30 percent finer than current UV wave lasers that are already used commercially. Compared to the very widespread infrared lasers, the channels of the new laser are three times as fine. Finer channels allow for reduced use of silver paste and can thus help further reduce production costs.
“The special thing about the design of the demonstrator is that large workpieces can be processed very quickly and with a small structure size,” said Jale Schneider, project manager at Fraunhofer ISE. “A large image field, fast processing, fine structures – the idea that you can only have two of these three properties at the same time is firmly anchored in the laser material processing industry. With this system, we have fulfilled all three wishes at the same time.”
German laser specialist Edgewave GmbH developed the prototype. Moewe Optical Solutions built a polygon scanner for the project. At Fraunhofer ISE, the team put together the polygon scanner, the laser and an axis for beam guidance into a system. The group now wants to look at new processes to increase throughput.
