Europe has seen skyrocketing gas prices since the drop in Russian gas exports, with spot prices on the Netherlands-based Title Transfer Facility (TTF) rising to an average €134 ($135.15)/MWh so far this year. Rystad forecasts prices will stabilize at around €31 per MWh by 2030, which puts the LCOE of existing gas-fired plants closer to €150 per MWh.
“This is still three times more than the LCOE of new solar PV facilities. For gas-fired plants to continue being competitive, gas prices would need to fall closer to €17 per MWh and carbon prices would need to fall to €10 per tonne, which is currently unthinkable,” the company said in a statement.
“Gas will continue to play an important role in the European energy mix for some time to come, but unless something fundamental shifts, then simple economics, as well as climate concerns, will tip the balance in favor of renewables,” said Carlos Torres Diaz, head of power at Rystad Energy.
If gas funds were invested in renewables instead, Europe could replace gas with solar and onshore wind power generation by 2028, when total capacity would reach 333 GW, Rystad forecasts. This estimate assumes a weighted average capital cost for the technologies of €1.3 per watt, as well as a two-year pre-development phase.

Researchers in the US have calculated that the globalized supply chain saved $67 billion in solar panel production costs compared with a counterfactual scenario in which domestic manufacturers supplied an increasing proportion of installed capacities over the given period.
Specifically, their study looked at historically installed capacities as well as input material and sales price data for deploying solar panel modules in the US, Germany and China — the three largest solar-deploying countries. It found that the globalized solar supply chain has delivered savings of $24 billion for the U.S., $7 billion for Germany and $36 billion  for China.
Had each of the three countries adopted strong nationalistic trade policies that limited cross-border learning over the same time period, solar panel prices in 2020 would have been significantly more expensive — 107% higher in the US, 83% higher in Germany, and 54% higher in China — according to the study “Quantifying the cost savings of global solar photovoltaic supply chains,” published in Nature.
The research team also looked at the cost implications of more protectionist trade policies going forward. They estimate that if strong nationalistic policies are implemented, solar panel prices will be approximately 20-25% higher in each country by 2030 compared to a future with globalized supply chains. Policies such as imposing import tariffs could complicate efforts to accelerate deployment of renewables like solar by raising the cost of production, the researchers said.
“Policies that cut off global value chains and restrict flows of people and capital will disrupt the global learning processes that have contributed precisely to solar’s success story,” said Michael Davidson, assistant professor at University of California San Diego and coauthor on the study. “Models demonstrating the feasibility of meeting ambitious clean energy targets rely upon continued cost declines which may not materialize if countries choose to go it alone.”
In light of the recently adopted Inflation Reduction Act in the US, the largest climate energy package in the country’s history, John Helveston, lead author of the study and assistant professor of engineering management and systems engineering at the George Washington University, said, “What our study contributes to this conversation is a reminder not to implement these policies in a protectionist manner. Supporting the US manufacturing base can and should be done in a way that encourages firms to trade with foreign partners to continue to accelerate cost reductions.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/27/5-cooling-down-solar-modules-by-increasing-space-between-panel-rows/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 27, 2022",Cooling down solar modules by increasing space between panel rows,"A research group led by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has proposed a new approach to utilize connective heat transfer for solar module cooling in large-scale solar power plants.
Their modeling considers factors such as row spacing, panel height, and tilt angle. It also uses a length scale input to characterize the space through which air moves around or through the solar modules. In the standard models, by contrast, the length often used is a ratio of module dimensions, which ignores PV plant configuration.
“The convective heat transfer curve was generated through computational flow simulations and wind tunnel experiments that allowed for convective heat transfer to be described for a lacunarity length scale value that describes the spacing of the entire PV array through a single length unit,” the scientists said, claiming that using the lacunarity length scale leads to 1.5% more accurate power production.
Their techno-economic analysis considered 1 MW south-facing PV systems located in Phoenix, Arizona, with a fixed tilt angle of 30 degrees over different row spacings, or ground coverage ratio (GCR). The annual land lease cost was assumed at $0.054/m2. The row spacing of the PV plants was varied from two to 11 meters, corresponding to GCR values of 0.73 to 0.08.
“Increasing spacing could enable more varieties of crops and more types of agricultural equipment to be utilized in agrivoltaic systems,” said Jordan Macknick, who leads a different NREL research project focused on agrivoltaics. “That could potentially make these spaced-out solar systems more cost-effective and compatible with larger-scale agriculture.”
Through the modeling, the group ascertained that the optimal levelized cost of energy (LCOE) point was $0.29/kWh, with row spacing varying between 4.83 and 7.34 meters. With two-meter spacing, the LCOE was $0.33/kWh, and with 11 meters it was $0.36/kWh.
The group found that the greatest LCOE improvements were registered in climates with low average annual ambient temperatures and moderate to high average annual wind speeds across the US. They presented the modeling in the study “Technoeconomic Analysis of Changing PV Array Convective Cooling Through Changing Array Spacing,” recently published in the IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics.
Other recent proposals for using convective solar module cooling include packing PV panels in close proximity, and taking wind direction and module inclination into account.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/27/worlds-largest-salt-cavern-compressed-air-storage-project-breaks-ground/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"OCTOBER 27, 2022",World’s largest salt cavern compressed air storage project breaks ground,"Compressed air energy storage (CAES) is expected to play a key role in China’s clean energy push and the latest project announcement attests to the fact.
According to a media statement from the state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, construction started on a 350 MW/1.4 GWh CAES project in the province of Shangdong on September 28.
Once completed, the Tai’an demonstration project is expected to be the world’s largest salt cavern CAES project, comprising two units for a total of 600 MW. The 350 MW system, which will be delivered in the first phase, is being jointly built by China Energy Engineering Group and Tai'an-based Taian Taishan New Energy Development to the tune of CNY 2.23 billion ($311 million).
The unit is based on the 325 C low-melting point molten salt high-temperature thermal insulation compression technology. It has a designed energy storage and charging time of eight hours and a discharging time of four hours.
Once both units are delivered, the Tai’an project will be capable of generating about 1 billion kWh of power annually.
According to the Commission’s announcement, the project “will help boost advanced new-type energy storage technology, encourage consumption of renewable energy and improve recycling of the waste salt cavern resource.”
CAES is not a new technology. The first system (290 MW) was installed in Huntorf, Germany, in 1978 and is still in operation today. In 1988, the Alabama Electric Cooperative’s 110 MW CAES plant also began operations in North America. However, CAES seems to have been given a new lease on life in recent years with several large-scale projects announced in the United States, Israel and Canada.
China’s CAES ambitions are particularly big. Last month, the Chinese Academy of Sciences switched on a 100 MW compressed air energy storage system in China’s Hebei Province. The facility can store more than 132 million kWh of electricity per year.
The country's largest operational CAES system is currently a 60 MW plant built by Chinese state-owned energy group Huaneng, Tsinghua University, and China National Salt Industry Group in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province. The facility features a salt cavern, situated 1,000 meters underground and owned by China National Salt Industry Group. The system has an efficiency of more than 60% and is expected to reach a power generating capacity of 1 GW.

In the study “Nano-optical designs for high-efficiency monolithic perovskite–silicon tandem solar cells,” published in nature nanotechnology, the scientists explained that the gentle sinusoidal nanotexture that they used in the cell combines the advantages of structuring the silicon surface with maintaining high material quality of the solution-processed perovskite.
“We show that the nanotexturing causes a substantial reduction of reflection losses compared to their planar counterpart, strongly improves the fabrication yield enabled by the excellent film formation properties and increases the open-circuit voltage by 15 mV,” they stated.
By using ultraviolet nanoimprint lithography, reactive ion etching and wet chemical etching, the German group built the cell with a reflector with a dielectric buffer layer (RDBL) at the rear side of the silicon bottom cell and a sinusoidal nanostructure at the front surface.
The team designed the tandem device with a passivated contact made with a layer of hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon carbide (nc-SiC:H(n)), doped indium oxide as the transparent conducting oxide (TCO), a self-assembled monolayer of methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz) as the hole-transport layer, and a perovskite absorber. The silicon silicon bottom cell has a size of 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 and a 1.1 cm2 contact area in the center.
“The RDBL comprises a silicon oxide (SiO2) buffer layer between the TCO and the silver back-reflector, reducing parasitic absorption losses. A silver grid covering 4% of the active area is screen-printed on top of the TCO before SiO2 deposition to establish the electric contact between the TCO and Ag,” they further explained.
Experts from Germany's Fraunhofer ISE CalLab tested the performance of the solar cell and certified that it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 29.80%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.92 V, a short-circuit current of 19.56 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 79.4%. The scientists said these short-circuit current levels, for both the perovskite top cell and the silicon bottom cell, are among the highest values reported in the literature for two-terminal tandem perovskite-silicon cells to date.
“A sensitivity analysis further indicates that the nanotextures substantially improve the performance robustness upon deviations from the optimal nanocrystalline silicon oxide layer thickness — an important aspect with regards to the industrialization of tandem technology and processing on larger areas,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/27/vietnam-set-to-open-renewable-energy-market-to-ppas/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,VIETNAM",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 27, 2022",Vietnam set to open renewable energy market to PPAs,"Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIOT) aims to open up Vietnam’s electricity market to bilateral power purchase agreements (PPAs) through a pilot scheme that would, for the first time, enable renewable energy generators to directly sell electricity to private off-takers under virtual or synthetic deals.
Under current regulations, the state-owned energy company Electricity Vietnam (EVN) has a monopoly over the transmission, distribution, wholesale and retail of electricity and is the sole buyer in the market.
The scheme is yet to be launched, and “no clear date exists yet,” Moritz Sticher, senior advisor at Berlin-based consulting firm Apricum, told pv magazine. It was scheduled to run between 2022 and 2024, with expectations now pointing to the first quarter of 2023. The official program following the pilot scheme should then start in 2025.
The government has drafted several pieces of legislation since 2020 and several amendments have continued to drag the program on. In January, changes to the scheme’s tariff structure were introduced. “The off-taker would now buy at the retail price instead of spot market price plus PPA charges,” said Sticher. The national utility, Genco, would still be paid by EVN at wholesale price. The buyer and the generator would also enter into a forward contract for difference for future trading cycles.
“This mechanism now gives investors a fixed tariff and puts the risk of tariff fluctuation on the off taker. The tariff change from wholesale to retail tariff for off-takers means around 2% more share to EVN and hence slightly reduced returns on the investor side (assuming the off-taker will aim for the same total tariff) and slightly less attractive for off-takers due to the change in electricity tariff risk,” Sticher explained.
The pending PPA program has hindered utility-scale project development in Vietnam, which has “little appetite for quick large-scale solar capacity additions,” according to Sticher. Constant uncertainty around renewable energy targets, ongoing curtailment issues, and stranded projects from the previous feed-in-tariff rounds have also allegedly contributed to that scenario.
Vietnam currently has around 18.47 GW of solar capacity installed, according to data from Apricum’s new “Solar power in ASEA” report. The National Power Development Plan VII reduced solar targets up to 2045 to 13.6 GW of utility-scale and 3.4 GW of rooftop solar. Offshore and onshore wind would compensate for the decrease in solar generation, as well as electricity imported from Laos, according to Apricum.
The commercial and industrial (C&I) segment is growing in the country, with Apricum forecasting 10,792 MWp of total installed capacity by the end of 2022, according to its central scenario. Most C&I projects are financed by independent power producers (IPPs).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/27/its-time-to-combat-utility-opposition-to-solar/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",,"OCTOBER 27, 2022",It’s time to combat utility opposition to solar,"There are plenty of examples of big utilities using their monopoly status and wealth – the latter derived from profits guaranteed by state governments around the US – to try to block customer access to self-generation technology.
For starters, in 2020 PG&E [Pacific Gas and Electric Company], SDG&E [San Diego Gas & Electric], and Southern California Edison between them pushed through an average $900 per year tax on consumers of solar and on energy storage systems. In making this proposal, the investor-owned utilities (IOUs) explicitly contemplated the need to tax self-consumption, including non-exporting battery systems, simply because the consumer would purchase less of the IOUs' product.
California Solar & Storage Association
If the IOUs did not hold a monopoly over California’s electricity market, if they weren’t guaranteed a profit by California regulators which amounted to more than $48 billion in 2021, they would have no standing in demanding a tax on consumers who use less electricity. The idea is preposterous. But these three investor-owned utilities control 80% of California’s electricity market and, as a result, have undue influence over energy policy. They use their wealth and status to influence policymakers, hiring PR firms to push out fake math and false messages around equity and ratepayer protection, and they generally work to block and tackle competition in the marketplace.
California isn’t alone in this dynamic. There other examples of monopoly utilities abusing their power and status throughout the country. A 2021 report, Blocking Rooftop Solar, by J David Lippeatt, Adrian Pforzheimer, Bryn Huxley-Reicher, and Bronte Payne of sustainability research body the Frontier Group and the research and policy center of nonprofit Environment California, details more than a dozen examples.
The report points out how FP&L [Florida Power & Light], Duke Energy, and Tampa Electric Co used their power in the state to block pro-solar policies that would enable consumers to go solar. The utilities directed more than $43 million to state-level political parties, candidates and committees, including the governor, over the 2014 to 2016 election cycles.
The current edition of pv magazine casts an eye over the Asia-Pacific solar markets, considering how cross-border interconnections can drive better resource efficiency, as well as the crucial role microgrids can play in the continuing roll-out of photovoltaics. We also examine the Tango fab being planned in Sicily by Italian energy group Enel as part of Europe's attempts to shore up energy security with a domestic solar supply chain.
In another example, concerning a utility active in 16 US states, Lippeatt et al write about how, in 2020, Dominion proposed a suite of solar-only fees and charges designed to penalize solar users, totaling $750 per year.
Of course, it is not just in the US that legacy power companies take advantage of their monopoly status to harm consumer-controlled generation resources. In Australia, there has been a proposal to charge solar users for energy exports while at the same time not levying such a fee on other generation resources.
California solar companies are suffering under the uncertainty of state policy making. The “NEM-3” proceeding to modify the state’s net metering policy was launched in August of 2020 – more than two years ago. Stock prices have plummeted for publicly traded companies due to the uncertainty. The state’s small, family-run businesses – which make up 80% of the market – are being hit with more and more red tape while bracing for the negative impacts of a yet-to-come NEM decision.
Last December, the California Public Utilities Commission proposed a NEM-3 verdict that was nearly as bad as what was proposed by the utilities. It included a huge monthly tax for solar households and a dramatic slashing of the credit solar households get for power they export to the grid. The proposal faced a widespread public backlash and was immediately put on hold but a new decision has yet to be released nearly a year later.
If California ends up with dramatic overnight changes to NEM, small solar companies could simply go out of business or leave the state because the cost of doing business would go up just as the value of solar and energy storage would fall. These PV businesses, which number in the thousands and employ the majority of solar workers, have been living with the policy uncertainty for two years now. Just how they fare in the months ahead is up to California governor Gavin Newsom and the policies his administration adopts in the next few weeks and months.
At the end of the day, however, it is the consumer who loses the most. The California energy consumer is paying extremely high prices for electricity that is increasingly unreliable. When the California consumer attempts to solve this problem through self-generation, they are threatened with taxes and penalties. Nowhere is this more starkly illustrated than in the example of a working class family living in California’s Central Valley, where summertime temperatures commonly top 105 F and air conditioning loads are high and expensive. With the decline in solar pricing, these families are going solar in large numbers, driving the growth of new adoption in the past three years. The utilities’ proposed penalties and taxes would hit these consumers the hardest as they are the least able to shoulder a hit on the economics of going solar.
Ultimately, the rise of consumer-based clean energy technologies such as solar and storage systems does not necessarily mean the end of the monopoly utility. Someone needs to build and maintain the roadways for electrons to travel on and the capacity of the grid will grow as we electrify transportation. However, we can reduce the amount of grid expansion with the build out of distributed generation, which would save everyone money. The state’s monopoly utilities might not make as much money under a high-electrification future with more local generation but they will still be very profitable. There is no death spiral for the California electric utility.
The key to balancing all the interests is to have a strong watchdog agency independent of utility influence and held accountable by the consumers it serves. To achieve this, we must have an informed and engaged populace that has real energy options and competitive markets to keep prices down. This has always been the balancing act in America. Time will tell whether California remains the incubator of innovation and consumer choice or if it falls back into the arms of the monopoly-utility past to the detriment of solar industry and consumer alike.
Bernadette Del Chiaro is executive director of the California Solar & Storage Association business group. She will moderate a talk on abuse of monopoly positions by utilities at the Empower 2022 virtual summit organized by solar software company Aurora Solar on Nov 1-2. As part of the event, Aurora will match up to $25,000 worth of donations made to the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust’s (MWCT's) solar PV and storage capacity project, via the Aurora/MWCT GoFundMe page.

Four workers from a plant’s subcontractor suffered burns as a result of exposure to high-temperature water, caused by a leak in the equipment they were inspecting.
Two of the workers were transferred to intensive care units, while the other two are receiving hospital care, Cerro Dominador said in a social media post. It announced that “work at the plant has been immediately suspended to review and reconfirm the safety and health procedures for workers.” The incident is being investigated by the local authorities.
In the same communication, Cerro Dominador denies that there has been an “explosion” at the plant, a clarification they claim to make “due to the disclosure of some erroneous information.”
The solar thermal plant was inaugurated in June last year, after construction began in 2014. It has a capacity of 110 MW and 17.5 hours of thermal storage.
The construction of the project, owned by EIG Global Energy Partners, was carried out by a consortium of Spanish companies Acciona and Abengoa. The 700-hectare solar field has 10,600 heliostats that direct solar radiation to a receiver located 252 meters above the ground. The nearby photovoltaic plant has a capacity of 100 MW and has been in commercial operation since February 2018. The renewable energy complex is the first to combine both technologies in the world.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/27/new-process-to-recycle-si-pv-modules/,"SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",MARIJA MAISCH,"OCTOBER 27, 2022",New process to recycle Si-PV modules,"As the decommissioning volume keeps increasing, the proper disposal of PV modules has become an emerging environmental and social issue. But while the recycling of silicon PV modules is technically viable, it is often not feasible economically due to reasons that vary from high processing cost to low waste volumes that do not justify investment cost.
Now, a team of UNSW researchers has proposed a novel, simple, cost-effective and environmentally friendly method to recycle silicon PV modules. The process consists of module deframing, laminate shredding and material concentration using electrostatic separation.
The process outputs two fractions: a valuable mixture of silver, copper, aluminium and silicon, and a mixture of mostly glass, silicon and polymers. The valuable mixture accounts for only 2-3% of the total module, which can be forwarded to the downstream industry for further refinement.
According to the researchers, the process can be profitable and is advantageous when dealing with small volumes, for instance 1,000 tons of solar panels a year.
Specifically, their paper evaluates the technical aspects of the process (quantifies material separation, energy and time) while using life cycle assessment and life cycle costing to evaluate the environmental impacts and economic prospects, respectively. The results are compared to a full recovery alternative (FRELP) and to landfilling.
Economic assessment shows the process has potential to be more profitable than FRELP at lower waste volumes (smaller than 4 kt/year), because of the smaller equipment capital cost, and if there is no market for the recovered glass, which is currently the case in many locations. Not to mention when the end-processing industry is located afar, since only the valuable mixture would require shipping.
Environmentally, a full recovery is preferred, followed by the proposed process, both of which have a net positive impact and are better than landfilling the whole module, the researchers write in their paper titled “High yield, low cost, environmentally friendly process to recycle silicon solar panels: Technical, economic and environmental feasibility assessment” published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.
Around 1.7 million tonnes of waste volume of end-of-life PV modules are expected by 2030 under the regular loss scenario of a 2016 analysis by the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA PVSP) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), with approximately 60 million tonnes expected by 2050. If the early loss scenario pans out, there could be 8 million tonnes of PV waste by 2030, and a total of 78 million tonnes by 2050.
And while recycling solar panels rather than sending them to landfills addresses an important environmental issue, material recovery is also projected to become big business.
Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy estimates that recyclable materials from PV panels at the end of their lifespan will be worth more than $4.2 billion (USD 2.7 billion) in 2030, up from only $262 million this year, and the value will approach $123 billion by 2050.
Rystad projects that solar PV waste will grow to 27 million tonnes per annum by 2040, and they estimate that recovered materials from retired panels could make up 6% of solar investments by 2040, compared to only 0.08% today.
