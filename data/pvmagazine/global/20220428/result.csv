But, as to the specific materials and device structure(s) that will make it beyond the research stage, there are still many different routes being pursued, each with its own disadvantages and disadvantages.
Creating contacts for the cell, which allow the generated current to flow out of it, offers one example.
“Metal contact electrodes [commonly used today] can stimulate degradation of PSCs due to diffusion of metal impurities across the interfaces,” said scientists led by Fraunhofer ISE in a newly published paper. “This problem can be fundamentally overcome by replacing the metal contact with chemically inert and robust carbon-graphite electrodes in PSCs (C-PSCs), which are highly promising for commercialization due to their ambient pressure processability based on industrially established printing techniques.”
They go on to explain that C-PSCs create a problem elsewhere in the cell, leading to performance losses at the point where the carbon electrode meets the perovskite layer. And to overcome this, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE worked with scientists at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland to develop a blocking layer to place between the two.
They deposited another perovskite formulation onto the active cell layer, and using various imaging techniques, they were able to confirm that this additional layer served to block electrons from movement in the “wrong” direction, and increase the cell performance.
Thy described the approach in “Employing 2D-Perovskite as an Electron Blocking Layer in Highly Efficient (18.5%) Perovskite Solar Cells with Printable Low Temperature Carbon Electrode,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials. As the title suggests, the group fabricated cells that reached 18.5% efficiency and maintained 82% of this after 500 hours of constant, one-sun illumination. A control device fabricated without the blocking layer achieved 15.7% initial efficiency, and had lost 63% of this after 200 hours under illumination.
“We believe that the approach of the employment of 2D perovskite as an EBL can help pave the way for the future practical development of fully printable C-PSCs with high efficiency and long-term stability,” the group concluded.

While the €13.49 billion ($14.2 billion) the Polish government says it will devote to such facilities, to the end of 2026, is less than the €15.1 billion allocated by Italy, the latter represents only 7.9% of the total spending package tabled by Rome and approved by the bloc. Clean power and technology spending instead accounts for 37.5% of the budget submitted in Warsaw's Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP).
The European Union has committed to dole out €723.8 billion across member states to finance their recovery from the pandemic. With the package to consist of €338 billion of non-repayable grants and €385.8 billion of EU loans, according to Brussels-based Bruegel, the final RRP was submitted by the Netherlands at the end of last month.
With details difficult to nail down, Bruegel used various measures to assess how the member state spending plans should be broken down. It provided reference to seven definitions outlined by the European Commission, which include spending on renewables and clean tech, and budgeting for sustainable transport and charging facilities.
With the commission having required the national budgets to allocate at least 37% of the funds to a wider “green transition” definition, Poland surpassed that threshold for renewables and clean tech alone. The €360 million allocated to clean power and technology by Cyprus accounted for 28.9% of its RRP, according to Bruegel, with Czechia allotting 25.6% of its finance (€1.81 billion), Malta 22.6% (€80 million), and Bulgaria 22.1% (€1.46 billion).
Coming up short
Sweden and Luxembourg met the 37% green transition mark without allocating any of their RRP funds to renewables and clean tech. Alongside Italy in the relative EU laggards in that respect are Latvia, which allocated €80 million (4.4% of its RRP) to such priorities, Ireland (€50 million and 5.5%), Spain (€4.72 billion making up only 6.8%), and Portugal (€1.23 billion and 7.4%). Germany‘s €3.32 billion for renewables and clean tech amounts to 11.9% of its total RRP budget and France‘s €3.68 billion makes up 9%.
Sustainable transport and charging points supplied a large chunk of spending in the bloc's smallest member states, with those priorities accounting for 32.7% (€30 million) of Luxembourg's plans and 32% of (€110 million) of Malta's. The €8.84 billion allocated by Romania for sustainable transport accounted for 30% of its RRP and Hungary‘s €1.81 billion made up a quarter of its pandemic-recovery spending.
At the other end of the scale, low-emission transport accounts for just 2% of Czechia's plans, with a budget of €150 million, and the same sum adds up to 4.5% of Sweden's planned spending on the issue, and 7.1% of Finland‘s. The €970 million allocated by Portugal accounts for 5.8% of its total RRP and Greece will spend €1.05 billion on the same percentage of its pandemic-recovery fund.
The €5.93 billion Germany will devote to sustainable transport is 21.2% of its overall spend. Spain will allocate 19% of its funds to the issue (€13.2 billion), Italy will apportion 18.5% of its cash to transport (35.4 billion), and France 16.6% (€6.78 billion).
Spendthrift states
The breakdown produced by the think tank, which is largely financed by EU member states and European corporate members, also offered an insight into the budgeting approach of the nations concerned. Eighteen countries applied for the maximum amount of grant funding the commission estimates it will be able to raise for them, while the same could be said of only two countries when it comes to the available loans.
Germany has asked for €2.3 billion more grant assistance than the EU anticipates will be available, France €1.5 billion more, and Austria a €1 billion bonus. Slovakia and Bulgaria face having to make up a €300 million overshoot in their grant request from their own coffers, and Croatia and Romania are set for €100 million shortfalls. Surprisingly, Latvia has requested only €1.8 billion of the €2 billion the EU estimates will be available to it in non-repayable grants. Bruegel indicates a final decision has not been made by the Netherlands.
On the proportion of recovery funding that would have to be returned to the commission, Romania has signed up to its maximum €15 billion credit line and Italy is not far short, having to date requested loans worth €122.6 billion of the €122.8 billion the commission expects to offer. Four nations have taken a more cautious approach, with Poland seeking €12.1 billion of a projected €34.8 billion borrowing package, Slovenia asking for €700 million of €3.2 billion, and Portugal preparing to draw down just €2.7 billion of an anticipated €14.2 billion overdraft.
Greece, by contrast, has asked the EU for loans worth €12.7 billion, despite having been offered only an estimated €12.4 billion of credit.

“The company is in active discussions regarding the factory’s location,” Laureen Sanderson, chief communications officer for CubicPV, told pv magazine. “Effectively immediately, the five-year agreement – subject to certain terms and conditions and with options for renewal – establishes a commitment for an annual purchase volume of 1 GW of Direct Wafer cells from Cubic’s factory.”
Waaree will begin purchasing cells from CubicPV upon completion of the factory, Sanderson added. The cells will feature wafers made with CubicPV’s transformative Direct Wafer technology, which produces wafers in one step, directly from a molten bath of silicon. The product purportedly delivers the world’s lowest cost of electricity today, while offering a significant reduction in carbon footprint over conventional methods.
“Our Direct Wafer technology is the ideal solution for India’s domestic utility market and Waaree, by choosing this technology over generic methods, is setting the tone for an Indian manufacturing future that makes better use of materials, requires less energy and is defined by high efficiency,” said Frank van Mierlo, CEO of CubicPV. “CubicPV is honored to begin our journey in India with Waaree. The synergy between one of the leading module manufacturers in India and Cubic’s innovation agenda will create value for both companies and the solar industry in India.”
The partnership with CubicPV provides Waaree with a domestic supply line and thus a level of immunity with respect to the logistics challenges and volatile commodity pricing that has defined the import market.
“As an early entrant in the solar industry, Waaree recognizes the value of innovation to our continued leadership position. We believe that CubicPV’s technologies will deliver significant benefit to our customers and to the Indian solar market both immediately and in the long-run. We are proud to bring a module to the market featuring domestically-produced wafers and cells manufactured with a low carbon footprint,” said Hitesh Doshi, chairman and managing director of Waaree.
CubicPV was formed from the merger of US wafer maker 1366 Technologies and Hunt Perovskite Technologies.

The agency wants to select proposals for solar projects up to 10 MW in size from both domestic and foreign investors. Selected projects will be granted construction permits, as well as a fixed tariff.
SATBA said there are currently more than 80 GW of renewable energy projects that have been submitted by private investors for review. They could all potentially compete in the procurement exercise.
The tender is part of a plan that was recently announced by the Iranian Ministry of Energy to install 10 GW of renewable energy capacity over the next four years, as part of an overall strategy to deploy 30 GW of power generating capacity.
Iran has an installed renewables capacity of around 1 GW, with solar accounting for about 456 MW of the total. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country installed around 26 MW of new PV capacity in 2021, 50 MW in 2020, and around 90 MW in 2019.

The documents provide a definition of “agrivoltaics,” along with a guide for the classification criteria.
“A simple classification of projects by type of PV system and/or by crop is not possible in the current state of knowledge,” the agency said. “Our work has enabled the creation of a decision tree, which is a real tool for analyzing and identifying the most virtuous projects. A case-by-case analysis of the projects is essential in order to evaluate them and position them in the proposed classification gradient.”
Ademe defines agrivoltaics in the following way: “An agrivoltaic installation is a PV system whose modules are located on the same surface of an agricultural production, to which they bring the following services, without causing a significant qualitative and quantitative degradation of the agricultural yield, as well as a reduction of the revenue generated from the agricultural activity. Service of adaptation to climate changes, service of protection to extreme weather events, service of improving animal welfare, agronomic service for specific cultures.”
Agrivoltaic projects must always imply the presence of a farmer. Such installations must also be reversible and adapted to local conditions, without damage to the environment. Agrivoltaic installations should also be adaptable to new conditions.
“A more precise definition of agrivoltaism has been proposed and it is based on the notion of synergy between agricultural production and PV production on the same plot area,” Ademe said. “The PV installation must provide a service in response to an agricultural problem. For example, an agrivoltaic system can consist of PV modules above plant production to protect it from excessive sunlight, to limit water stress through a shading effect, or to reduce the risks associated with climatic conditions such as hail or frost. Thus, while producing energy, this type of device can, in certain configurations, provide a beneficial service to the agricultural production in place.”
In June 2021, French solar companies Sun'Agri, REM Tec, Kilowattsol, and Altergie Développement et Râcines announced the creation of France Agrivoltaisme, the world's first trade body for the agrivoltaics sector.

“The funding will be used to take the innovative Peak Reduction by Integrated Storage and Management of Air (Prisma) system from laboratory scale testing to demonstration level at Aggregate Industries’ Cauldon Cement Works in Staffordshire,” the BCES said in a statement. “This will be a key step in the Prisma system’s journey to full commercialization.”
The Prisma systems will be manufactured in northeastern England, with the aim of installing the first industrial-scale, behind-the- meter system in early 2023. “On the back of the demonstration at Aggregate Industries, Innovatium have currently closed an investment round of GBP 900,000 for product development of Prisma,” the director of the BCES, Yulong Ding, told pv magazine.
The LAES system stores thermal energy in liquid air form to provide onsite compressed air and works through a latent energy cold storage tank filled with a phase-change material (PCM) designed and tested by Innovatium, in partnership with the University of Birmingham. It is applied in an existing compressed air network operated by Aggregate Industries. PCMs can absorb, store and release large amounts of latent heat over a defined temperature range and have often been used, at the research level, for PV module cooling.
The PCM materials used for liquid air energy storage operate at cryogenic temperatures below -150 C. They store and discharge huge amounts of thermal energy between the freezing and melting cycle.
“Innovatium’s is currently working with researchers at Birmingham and Strathclyde University to develop a special formulation that does not degrade over time and is safer and environmentally friendlier than conventional batteries,” Ding said.
Two PCMs were developed with phase-change temperatures of around -100 C and -160 C. The PCMs are composite materials, typically made of a PCM, a structural stabilization material and a heat transfer enhancement material.
During the charging phase, which takes place in off-peak hours, the system utilizes excess electricity from renewable energy sources and stores it in the form of liquid air through an air liquefaction process. During this process, liquid air is compressed, cooled down by a packed bed cold store, liquified by the stored cold in the PCM store and, eventually, during discharge it is expanded to produce compressed air for the client’s factory.
The cold energy of liquid air is also stored during discharge for re-use in the liquefaction process to reduce power consumption. This technology can be applied to generate electricity in an air expansion turbine when combined with a heat store or heat source.
The Prisma system uses liquid air as its energy storage medium that is 700 times as dense as ambient air.
“This system can provide hours of backup compressed air to industrial consumers and act as a large buffer store that allows air compressors to run more efficiently by reducing the part-load inefficiencies that are common to all compressed air systems,” Ding emphasized.
The consortium said the system design and the integration of the equipment and components has never been attempted for the provision of compressed air in an industrial setting. The fully developed system has a targeted installed cost of GBP 400/kWh.
“Innovatium do point out however that there is no degradation or limit to cycling that gives an expected levelized cost of storage of GBP 114/MWh. Their feedback from the market suggests that the commercial offering would suit a PPA especially when coupled with a solar PPA,” Ding concluded. “Our estimated LCOE is $0.15/kWh to $0.30/kWh.”

A new report by global think tank Ember shows that four of India’s states and union territories have already surpassed their 2022 renewable capacity targets, as India pursues aa target of 175 GW of clean energy installations by December 2022. However, 27 states and union territories have yet to achieve even half of their respective targets and will need a big step up to meet them by the end of the year.
The “India’s Race to 175 GW” report shows that India had installed 110 GW of renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) as of March 2022, which is 63% of the 175 GW target. With 54 GW of solar capacity and 40 GW of wind capacity on the grid, the nation is at half of its solar power target and two-thirds of its wind power target for 2022.
As of March, the states of Telangana, Rajasthan, Karnataka, and the union territory of Andaman and Nicobar had surpassed their end-of-year targets. Gujarat and Tamil Nadu are also inching closer to their targets. Uttarakhand and Sikkim are the only other Indian states that have achieved more than 50% of their targets.
The report says that all states need to contribute, as the nation will need 65 GW more in the next nine months to meet its renewable energy target of 175 GW by December. Five key Indian states account for two-thirds of this 65 GW shortfall: Maharashtra (11 GW), Uttar Pradesh (10 GW), Andhra Pradesh (9 GW), Madhya Pradesh (7 GW), and Tamil Nadu (5 GW). 
“Lack of progress in key states is holding back India’s race to 175 GW,” said Aditya Lolla, a senior electricity policy analyst for Ember. “Solar and wind deployments need a big push in the coming months to drive India closer to this target.”
Solar needs 85% growth in the next nine months to meet its 100 GW target by the end of 2022. Wind power needs almost a 50% increase in the next three quarters to reach the 60 GW target.
India is aiming for 450 GW of renewables and 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030. With 110 GW already installed, the nation needs to deploy 340 GW of new renewable energy capacity (on average, 42.5 GW of renewable energy per year for the next eight years) to meet the 2030 target.
That would require the country’s solar capacity to rise fivefold to 280 GW from 54 GW and wind to rise fourfold to 140 GW during this period. This translates to 29 GW of new solar and 12.5 GW of new wind capacity additions every year on average until the end of this decade – a far faster pace than the nation’s record annual addition of 15 GW renewable energy (14 GW of solar and 1 GW wind) in fiscal 2021-22. 
The report says it is more than possible for India to deliver on its 2030 targets of 450 GW of renewable energy or 500 GW opf non-fossil capacity if all states are fully engaged and aligned with the national targets.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/28/sofarsolar-launches-intelligent-ress/,"SPONSORED,CHINA",,"APRIL 28, 2022",Sofarsolar launches intelligent RESS,"Sofarsolar is a leading Chinese PV inverter and energy storage manufacturer. The company was founded in 2013 in Shenzhen, a city known for its expertise in Information and Communications Technology. Sofarsolar has been able to tap the city’s skilled workforce to build a research and development team of almost 300 researchers.  
Innovation is a key value at Sofarsolar and the company has moved quickly to complement its wide range of solar inverters with energy storage products. In addition to grid-tied inverters (1 kW to 255 kW), Sofarsolar also produces state-of-the-art hybrid inverters, ranging from 3 kW to 20 kW.  
The company’s new residential energy storage system is compatible with high current PV modules – a key advantage as high current modules displace conventional ones in many markets. The recommended maximum PV input power for the system’s inverter module ranges from 4500 Wp to 9000 Wp for the model with the highest nominal AC power (6000 W). On the LFP battery side, the basic module provides 5 kWh of energy and can be flexibly scaled to 10 kWh, 15 kWh, 20 kWh, 25 kWh and 30 kWh.  
Ease of installation and usability are other key values at Sofarsolar. The fully modular and thin, lighter design of the smart residential energy storage system (RESS) makes transportation and handling easier with no special tools required. Utilizing standardized accessories and quick plug connectors, there is no need to make wires on site with only simple wiring and fixing required.  
The system’s built in Power Control Unit (PCU) is able to automatically adjust output voltage and current and optimize the energy between battery packs.This ameliorates the capacity mismatch between battery packs and makes full use of the system’s available capacity. 
The RESS also allows for the mix use of old and new batteries. Should an individual battery function abnormally, it will automatically exit from operation and can be hot replaced directly with a new battery pack – quickly responding to a customer’s need. The system’s energy storage capacity can be expanded in stages, reducing the initial investment and boosting the return on investment of the battery array.The system’s ease of operation is further enhanced by real-time monitoring and upgrades that can be carried out remotely.  
But optimizing energy flows is only one aspect. Equally important is safety, especially when batteries are placed inside residential buildings. LFP battery technology has become the safe choice for such installations and Sofarsolar provided batteries, with electrical and physical double isolation, ensure an even higher level of safety. During transportation, installation and maintenance, the battery pack is in a dormant state and there is zero voltage output, making the product very safe to handle. Finally, module-level fire protection measures are included in Sofarsolar’s energy storage system. 
Sofarsolar will be showcasing its latest inverter and battery storage products at Intersolar Europe 2022 at its booth B1-330.

“Photovoltaic energy generation coupled to certain energy storage configurations in molecular hydrogen outperforms nuclear fusion reactors over 50% of the planet’s surface, mainly within those regions around the equatorial band, which is in fairly sharp contrast to what has been proposed over and over again in the literature, which is that it will be nuclear power,” said UC Berkeley researcher Aaron Berliner, noting that two energy sources were compared for the power supply of a six-person extended mission to Mars involving a 480-day stay on the planet’s surface before returning to Earth.
The US team considered four different scenarios: nuclear power generation with the miniaturized nuclear fission Kilopower system, PV power generation with battery energy storage, PV power generation with compressed hydrogen energy storage produced via electrolysis, and hydrogen generation with compressed hydrogen energy storage (PEC).
“In our calculations, we assumed a capacity factor of 75% to account for the solar flux deviation throughout the Martian year and sized energy storage systems to enable 1 full day of operations from reserve power,” the group explained. “We then calculated the carry-along mass requirements for each of the power generation systems considered.”
The scientists found that, of the three PV-based power generation options, only the photovoltaics-plus-electrolyzer system outcompetes the nuclear system based on carry-along mass. They also said that the optimal absorber bandgaps for the PV systems depend heavily on the location on the surface of Mars, the total depth of the air column above a given location, gradients in dust and ice concentrations, and orbital geometry effects that cause different effective air column thicknesses for locations near the poles.
“In conclusion, solar cell arrays with careful attention to semiconductor choice and device construction represent a promising technology for sustaining an Earth-independent crewed habitat on Mars,” the academics said. “Our analysis provides design rules for solar cells on the Martian surface and shows that solar cells can offer substantial reduction in carry-along mass requirements compared to alternative technology over a large fraction of the planet’s surface.”
They explained their findings in “Photovoltaics-Driven Power Production Can Support Human Exploration on Mars,” which was recently published in Frontiers.

Chile plans to develop protocols and technical and economic standards for the creation of a domestic industry for second-life PV modules.
The initiative is being led by Chile’s state-run Production Development Corp. (Corfo). It involves solar panel manufacturer Enel Green Power, a unit of Italian utility Enel, and the University of Antofagasta.
The consortium will conduct studies to classify end uses, laboratory tests, and pilot tests to allow the development of new standards. Among the potential beneficiaries of the reuse of panels are communities with poor access to electricity, social housing, agricultural land, and the construction industry.
This project is globally unique, said Enel Green Power Project Manager Daniel Manríquez, “because it will allow the integration of knowledge and real data from public and private entities present in one of the most prolific regions in the world in generation photovoltaic to give a new life cycle to millions of modules.”
Natalia Correa, head of circular economy for Enel Chile, said the initiative can be replicated in other areas related to the circular economy. “We are rethinking our relationship with the planet and its resources,” she said.
Enel is already working with second-life batteries. In Italy, it plans to deploy 5MW/10MWh of second-life batteries at Rome-Fiumicino International Airport, where a 30 MW solar park is now under development. The modular storage system will include different second-life lithium-ion batteries, mainly based on nickel, manganese and cobalt chemistry, with usable storage capacities ranging from 10 kWh to 25 kWh.

Germany's EUPD Research has released new findings from its annual survey of Australian solar installers. It focused on the preferred brands of modules, inverters and storage and looked at how companies are diversifying their offerings.
EUPD Research spoke to 200 companies, in cooperation with Australian analyst SunWiz. The findings support claims from the industry about its changing direction, driven by growing saturation. In the two years from 2019 to 2021, EUPD Research and SunWiz found that Australia’s solar capacity expanded at a compound annual growth rate of 26.7%. The residential segment accounted for most of this growth, with the utility-scale sector a close second, while commercial and industrial lagged.
There was a significant jump last year in the number of companies offering storage solutions, growing from 41% in 2020 to 54% in 2021. About 30% of companies said they plan to include storage solutions in their portfolios by the end of 2022.
Solar saturation
These numbers confirm what Kosta Bourandanis, a sales manager at wholesale distributor Supply Partners, recently told pv magazine about the saturation of the solar market in Australia. He said self-consumption is today the primary selling point for most solar systems, with feed-in tariffs no longer a drawcard.
This is hardly surprising, given that SunWiz estimated Australia’s cumulative installed solar PV capacity at the end of 2021 at 26.9 GW. For reference, the National Electricity Market’s demand since 2020 has sat at just over 30 GW, leaving very little room for other generation types during daylight hours.
Bourandanis said he is increasingly hearing of solar companies diversifying into electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries, as exporting back to the grid holds little promise. While EUPD Research’s “Market Briefing Australia” presentation did not speak at length on EVs, presenter Saif Islam noted that 12% of Australian companies are already offering “electric mobility solutions.”
In Australia, one-third of installation companies accounted for 89% of all of Australia’s installed PV capacity in 2021. The remaining 65% of “low-volume” solar companies accounted for just 11% of installations.
For Platinum Solar Designs General Manager Scott Mason, this points to a larger issue in the industry. Mason told pv magazine Australia that monopolization is a growing problem that has been exacerbated by the current governance structure.

According to an updated analysis based on the organization’s survey for solar workers and companies already affected by the investigation, SEIA has predicted that the case will result in a drop of 24 GW of planned solar capacity over the next two years, which is more solar than the industry installed in all of 2021. In losing this capacity, SEIA also estimates that the United States will emit an additional 364 million metric tons of carbon by 2035, missing the opportunity to effectively take 78 million internal combustion-engine vehicles off the road. By 2025, the imposition of tariffs will cause solar capacity to fall 75 GW short of the pace needed to reach the president’s goal, equal to the size of the entire US solar market prior to 2020.
These predictions are based on the assumptions of an affirmative decision on the Auxin petition, with tariffs imposed in the 50% to 250% range. The forecast is also based on sharply restricted module import supplies from countries named in the investigation, with manufacturers in unnamed countries needing time to pick up the slack.
According to the most recent publication of SEIA’s survey, with more than 700 responses by April 26, 83% of the respondents that purchase or use modules reported cancellations or delays in their module supply agreements. This is up from 75% reports of cancellations or delays when the first results of the survey were released on April 5, with those results stemming from roughly 200 respondents,
The impact is not just on solar projects. About 65% of respondents working in energy storage said they expect the investigation to have a devastating to severe impact on their business as well.
Project purgatory
Based on SEIA’s voluntary reporting, responses have outlined to SEIA that a total of 318 utility-scale projects accounting for 51 GW of solar capacity and 6 GWh of attached battery storage are being canceled or delayed. What’s more is that a large percentage of delayed projects could move into the realm of cancelation, as developers don’t know when they might be able to get modules and some delays may drag on to the point of project failure.
With respondent data from 39 states, all but two of those states are reporting utility scale project cancellations and delays above 100 MW in capacity. Leading the pack is Texas, with just over 13 GW of projects at risk, California at 7.5 GW, Ohio at 4.4 GW, Indiana at 3.6 GW, and Illinois at 2.5 GW. The figures are especially problematic for Ohio and Indiana, both of which are states that have historically not been leaders in installing solar, but have hit their stride as of late and had been projected to be two of the most active states across the entire country for development over the next five years.
SEIA shares that these figures also likely only represent a fraction of the investigation’s true impacts. Across the United States as a whole, 42% of the known utility-scale solar development pipeline has been disrupted. Indiana and Idaho both reported 100% of each state’s known pipeline being disrupted.
In the top-five states, every gigawatt of canceled projects represents roughly $1 billion in investment at risk. The ratio is actually a bit higher in California, where 7.5 GW of at-risk projects account for roughly $8 billion in investment risk.
Around 70% of survey respondents report that at least half their solar and storage workforce is at risk and more than 200 companies report that their entire workforce is at risk.
“If tariffs are imposed, in the blink of an eye we’re going to lose 100,000 American solar workers and any hope of reaching the president’s clean energy goals,” said SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “This would be a monumental loss for our nation, which has the potential to lead our clean energy future, with the right policies. Instead, the Commerce Department is on track to wipe out nearly half of all solar jobs and force a surrender on the President’s climate goals.”
It’s important to clarify that the figure of 100,000 jobs lost also includes new jobs not added, though SEIA asserts that the vast majority would be layoffs of existing workers. 16,000 to 18,000 solar manufacturing jobs would be not realized between 202223 due to the imposition of tariffs, the majority of which would be layoffs. For context, roughly 31,000 people were employed in solar manufacturing in 2020, the most recent year for which survey data is available.
