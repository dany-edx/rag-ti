Sao Paulo-based consulting firm Clean Energy Latin America (CELA) has launched a green hydrogen production cost index that applies to several Brazilian states. The new tool was developed based on CELA's own modeling and its experience with multiple H2V projects in Brazil. It said it will be updated every six months.
The cost index for producing green hydrogen in Brazil takes into account the nation's unique characteristics, encompassing factors like taxation, renewable resources such as solar and wind energy used in electrolysis to separate hydrogen and oxygen from water, as well as logistical aspects including investment data for plants, operational expenses, and capital costs.
In its inaugural release, CELA's LCoH Brazil Index reveals that it is currently feasible to manufacture green hydrogen in select strategic locations within Brazil at a levelized cost ranging from $2.87/kg to $3.56/kg. However, with optimization and incentives, these costs could potentially decrease to as low as $1.69/kg, making them highly competitive when compared to gray hydrogen derived from fossil fuels, known for its environmental impact.
Camila Ramos, the executive director of CELA, noted the index's significance as a valuable tool for decision-making regarding investments in H2V (hydrogen-to-vehicle) plants in Brazil. She said that it provides greater certainty regarding the economic viability and attractiveness of such projects.
“It is essential to choose the best location for the project, based on the consumer market for this green hydrogen and the technical and regulatory conditions of the state, which will make the difference in the financial viability of the project,” she said. “The index can also be a great guide for the technical and financial optimization of a project and a very clear signal to the Brazilian authorities about the importance of new incentives for the production of green hydrogen in the country.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/06/the-case-for-hard-carbon-based-sodium-ion-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA",MARIJA MAISCH,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2023",The case for hard carbon-based sodium-ion batteries,"Sodium-ion batteries have attracted extensive attention for their advantages over ubiquitous lithium-ion technology, including low-cost raw materials, improved safety, fast charging capabilities, and low temperature performance. With the technology on the cusp of commercialization, the search for electrode materials with high electrochemical performance is ongoing and hard carbon is emerging as the most promising anode material.
Now, a new research paper authored by scientists from Fuzhou University in China and the University of Macau has summarized the challenges as well as the perspectives on the future of hard carbon.
The researchers note that the commercialization of hard carbon still faces technical issues of low initial Coulombic efficiency, poor rate performance, and insufficient cycling stability, due to the intrinsically irregular microstructure of hard carbon.
“To address these challenges, the rational design of the hard carbon microstructure is crucial for achieving high-performance sodium-ion batteries, via gaining an in-depth understanding of its structure–performance correlations,” they write.
Furthermore, their review looks into a range of research studies brought about by the emergence of hard carbon electrodes, covering in the process the sodium storage mechanism of hard carbon electrodes, the selection of hard carbon precursors, electrolyte matching engineering, and the requirements for practical commercial engineering.
The researchers highlight the importance of precursor selection with most hard carbon electrode precursors derived from biomass materials and industrial product derivatives, such as cellulose, ginkgo leaf, glucose, cotton, resin, sucrose, or glucose. “The selection of low-cost, scalable precursors has become a key factor affecting hard carbon’s commercialization,” they write.
Their review also considers various sodium storage mechanisms, such as the insertion–nanopore filling model, absorption-insertion model, absorption-nanopore filling model, or absorption-insertion nanopore filling model, which can yield hard carbon materials with different properties.
In addition, the researchers underline the importance of matching the hard carbon electrode with the right electrolyte as an important factor for the electrochemical performance of the batteries. They note that ester electrolytes are a poor match with hard carbon, and therefore the search for high-voltage ester electrolytes should be a priority.
“In the future, determining how to construct high-performance hard carbon to achieve practical commercial applications of sodium-ion batteries is crucial, and this will require a thorough understanding of the real sodium-ion storage mechanism, hard carbon preparation and precursor selection, and electrolyte regulation,” the researchers write.
Finally, the paper highlights directions for the future development of hard carbon to achieve the commercialization of high-performance sodium-ion batteries.
This includes further study of the mechanism of hard carbon sodium storage to help improve the electrochemical performance of hard carbon electrodes, further improvement of their electrochemical performance, development of precursor materials with low cost, low energy consumption, and high carbon yield, and those derived from industrial waste product material, as well as presodiation treatments that can ensure high Coulombic efficiency and optimize the energy density of the battery.
“While the emergence of hard carbon electrodes has indeed promoted the commercialization of sodium-ion batteries, more work is still needed to make commercialization a reality, the researchers write in the paper titled “Revitalizing sodium-ion batteries via controllable microstructures and advanced electrolytes for hard carbon,” published in eScience.

It has developed four new products with capacities ranging from 30 kW to 375 kW, all of which use hydrofluoroolefins as a refrigerant.
“In addition to harnessing heat from ambient air and the ground, the heat pumps capture wasted heat from a wide range of sources, including data centers, leisure facilities, hotels and restaurants, process water, flue gases and sewage systems,” the manufacturer said. “Heat collected can be used for comfort heating and domestic hot water production in large buildings and facilities.”
One of the products, the 410 kW AquaForce 61CA air-source heat pump, can reach a temperature of up to 82 C. The manufacturer said it is a suitable solution for large buildings, as well as local and district heating networks.
The AquaForce 61CW-Z water-source heat pump, meanwhile, offers power ranging from 410 kW to 735 kW. It can achieve a temperature of up to 92 C. The new solution is recommended for district heating networks and industrial process heating systems.
The third product – the AquaForce 61CWD water-source heat pump – has a power range of 110 kW to 540 kW and can reach a temperature of up to 120 C.
“Screw compressors specially designed for the highest temperatures for heavy-duty continuous use,” the company said noting the product is also suitable for industrial process heating.
The smallest product, the AquaSnap 61CG water-source heat pump, has a capacity of 30 kW to 130 kW and can be cascaded to 390 kW. It can reach a temperature of up to 82 C and can be used for heat recovery in hotels, the food-processing sector, and the pharmaceutical industry, while also supporting energy supplies and data centers.
“The units come ready to connect to Abound, Carrier’s cloud-based digital platform that enables real-time, intelligent outcome-based results that make buildings more efficient and responsive,” the manufacturer said. “To minimize operating costs, users can opt for one of Carrier's BluEdge service options to keep heat pumps operating at peak performance and efficiency throughout their lifecycle.”

In August, Australia’s residential favorite solar system size, 6.6 kW, became more expensive on a per kilowatt basis than systems ranging from 10 kW to 15 kW. It is the first time the range from 6.3 kW to 8 kW has been dethroned on price.
SunWiz Managing Director Warwick Johnston told pv magazine Australia that the shift is due to rising competition. That is, 6.6 kW solar systems have traditionally been the mainstay for solar installers in Australia, so those selling different systems have had less competition.
“Now people have cottoned on, finally, to the [10+ kW] market being as almost as large as the 6.6 kW market,” Johnston said. Now with significantly more installers selling in this 10 kW plus market, competitive pressure has increased, he added. “Plus, people have got more experience in how to install those jobs.”
Another noteworthy trend emerging from Australia’s solar market is that leads continue to spike, even though fewer customers are actively seeking installations.
“Customers aren’t going out and searching for solar anymore than they used to, but there are definitely lots more leads flowing through,” Johnston said. “I haven’t seen such a strongly defined difference before.”

Called Geospatial Opportunity Mapping (GOMap), the new tool is built on the available QGIS framework, which is an open-source cross-platform desktop geographic information system application that supports viewing, editing, printing, and analysis of geospatial data.
“External plugins have been developed specifically for QGIS to tackle varying issues ranging from estimating evapotranspiration and surface air temperature mapping,” the scientists explained. “GOMap was written in Python version.”
The tool is reportedly able to determine the number of rooftop or ground-mounted solar projects that can be deployed in a given area, as well as the maximum number of wind turbines within a site considering site geometry and the minimum distance required between each turbine. It can also identify buildings that can be connected to a district heating network within a specified distance.
The tool also takes into account high-resolution information from both the local authorities and local utility companies. “GOMap has been designed in collaboration with two such bodies and is equipped with identifying sites for renewable energy deployment based on comprehensive and detailed spatial information,” the researchers said. “It also provides a template for users to generate opportunity maps for other cities or areas of interest.”
The British group also said the new tool is intended to enable decision-making processes and collaboration between city planners and utility specialists. It was introduced in the study “GOMap: A Python-developed GIS opportunity mapping tool for renewable energy technologies,” published in SoftwareX.

The 5 MW, 10-hour-duration Desert Blume project will use CMBlu’s non-lithium technology. CMBlue will build, own and operate the batteries on behalf of SRP at its Copper Crossing Energy and Research Center in Florence, Arizona.
CMBlu said its Organic SolidFlow battery technology is based on fully recyclable organic materials. It uses aqueous electrolyte solutions that are non-flammable. The company said the batteries are characterized by free scalability between power and capacity because the system separates the electrolyte from the actual energy converter, and self-discharge is avoided. Furthermore, by replacing individual components, original performance can be restored.
CMBlu expects its battery system to cost-effectively store and deliver energy for two to three times longer per cycle than traditional lithium-ion technology, which typically targets a four-hour duration.
While the battery installations are a pilot, SRP is depended on to provide water to about half of the valley’s residents, delivering more than 244 billion gallons of water each year, and it manages a 13,000-square-mile watershed that includes an extensive system of reservoirs, wells, canals and irrigation laterals. The battery project is designed to store energy for SRP’s customers during daytime periods, largely from solar generation, and return that energy to the grid throughout the night. It will store enough energy to power about 1,125 average homes for 10 hours.
In 2022, a fire broke out at the Salt River Project when a lithium-ion battery began smoldering. Area businesses were evacuated out of an abundance of caution due to the potential hazards caused by off-gassing. As an alternative to lithium-ion, the project is implementing the Organic SolidFlow batteries in the pilot project. This is the first U.S. utility implementation of CMBlu’s batteries at this scale.
SRP selected CMBlu after issuing a request for long-duration storage project proposals from emerging energy storage companies. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) will monitor the pilot project and help validate the performance of the technology in Arizona’s hot and dry climate.
This pilot is part of the third phase of development at SRP’s Copper Crossing Energy and Research Center. The first phase will add two flexible natural gas turbines with a total output of less than 100 MW, and the second phase will add a utility-scale solar generation facility capable of generating up to 55 MW of solar energy. Construction of the third phase is slated to begin in early 2025, and the pilot is expected to be operational in December 2025.
CMBlu’s technology will also be deployed in other pilot projects including one in Burgenland Energie in Austria, and another pilot in Milwaukee, Wisc. with WEC Energy.
CMBlu was founded in Germany in 2014 by biotech entrepreneur Peter Geigle and a group of German energy and automotive executives. Since passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, CMBlu has entered the US market.
“Compared to Germany and the rest of Europe, the US is clearly marching ahead in the development and application of large-scale storage solutions,” said Peter Geigle, founder and CEO. He added that once the company’s products gain acceptance, it will remain “fully committed to a US manufacturing presence.”

Used mainly for irrigation, PV-powered water pumps are a viable alternative to diesel-powered water pumps in remote areas. “The aim of this work was to study the reliability and performance of the PV-powered underground water pumping system under actual operating conditions, investigate negative impact factors on the PV system, and demonstrate the possibility of relying on this system as a safe and reliable alternative to the traditional energy systems that are expensive and pollute the environment,” the scientists said.
In the paper “Reliability and performance evaluation of a solar PV‑powered underground water pumping system,” published in scientific reports, the researchers explained that the system consists of two PV arrays with each a capacity of 4.6 kW and a pumping unit made up of a 7.5 kW three-phase alternating current motor, a multistage submersible pump, a deep well, and a 15 kW inverter.
They tested the performance of the system by considering, in particular, the hydraulic power of the system and the intensity of solar radiation, which led to the conclusion that the pumping unit efficiency is affected by the intensity of solar radiation, panel temperature, and AC power. “The inverter frequency was directly affected by the direct current produced by solar panels,” they stated. ”
The academics also calculated the overall system efficiency by splitting the system output (hydraulic power) by the system input (solar radiation power), or by multiplying the efficiencies of all system components. “The overall efficiency of the system is directly affected by solar radiation, but when solar radiation exceeds 900 W/m2 at noon, this is accompanied by an increase in temperature, which negatively affects the efficiency of the solar panels and thus the overall system efficiency,” they emphasized.
For each increase of 1 C in the temperature, the PV panel efficiency decreased by 0.48%. In turn, the power of the pump has affected the water flow rate, resulting in an average hourly discharge of 18.2, 22.2, and 22.8 m3/h in December, March, and June, respectively.
“The number of operating hours of the pump was 7, 7, and 8 h, and the amount of water pumped during the day was 129, 164.1, and 181.8 m3/ day, respectively,” the researchers added, noting that the overall average system efficiency was 7.40%, 8.46%, and 8.51% in December, March, and June, respectively.
The Egyptian group said the proposed system can provide a stable water supply, provided that negative environmental and technical factors are included in project design. “The design of the solar water pumping system goes through several stages, and some information such as daily water consumption, static water level, and the pumping pipes length and diameter must be known,” it specified.

Paired Power, a provider of solar-powered EV charging products, and Monarch Tractor, a fully electric tractor manufacturer announced the two have partnered to deliver an emissions-free tractor solution for Kaerskov Vineyard in Santa Ynez Valley, California. 
Since July, the vineyard has been operating Monarch’s MK-V electric tractor, charged fully with Paired Power’s solar canopy and EV charger. The solar charging solution can be installed as a rooftop system or raised as a canopy. 
The winery’s solar canopy is a 38.5 kW array comprised of 72 panels, 535 W each. The panels are made by JA Solar. 
The U.S.-made DC fast chargers charge directly from solar during daylight hours. The chargers can provide up to 100 A service. A full charge from 0% to 100% for the Monarch tractor typically takes five to six hours at 80 A. Paired Power said the racking and mounts for the canopy are U.S.-made, as well. 
The tractor was delivered with two swappable batteries. One can be used for operation while the other stores the solar generation from the day. 
Farmers may move increasingly toward electrification of vehicles as cost advantages shift from fossil fuels to the renewables sector. A Monarch tractor can also offset 54 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year when compared to a conventional tractor, the company reports. 
Monarch said the tractor comes with advanced collision prevention, human detection, and power take-off protection while reducing over 60% of the farm’s expense on tractor fueling and service. 
“Our mission at Monarch is to elevate overall operations, improve farmer profitability, and pave the way for sustainable farming,” said Praveen Penmetsa, co-founder and chief executive officer of Monarch Tractor. “Pairing the all-electric MK-V with renewable charging infrastructure like Paired Power’s solar solutions brings us closer to a farming future that is powered by clean energy solutions. We are pleased to partner with Paired Power and Carr Winery in taking this step toward more environmentally friendly farming practices.” 
Agriculture is responsible for about 20% of global emissions, according to McKinsey and Company. However, many farms are located in remote locations at the end of distribution lines, which can lead to an unstable power supply for charging electric machinery. As such, on-site and off-grid solutions like Paired Power’s may represent a pathway for farmers seeking to improve the emissions profile of their operations. 
“Our high-powered solar charger was designed with fleet applications in mind, as we know that providing a convenient means to charge electric tractors will be essential in the adoption of electrified farming. Our charging solutions are scalable to ensure that we can continue to provide easy renewable charging as electric fleets expand,” said Tom McCalmont, co-founder and chief executive officer of Paired Power.
