The funding was finalized at a GCF board meeting held last week.
The funding will go towards the Desert to Power initiative, a project led by ADB that aims to build 10 GW of PV capacity across multiple countries in the Sahel region of Africa – providing grid-connected electricity to 160 million people, and off-grid power to a further 90 million.
The Sahel is a semi-arid region separating the Sahara Desert to the north from the savanna to the south. While the ADB initiative supports all 11 countries of the region, this round of funding from GCF will primarily go to projects in the G5 Sahel – a French-led cooperation between Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.
“The Desert to Power G5 Sahel Facility is a significant shot in the arm for the Desert to Power initiative,” said ADB vice president Kevin Kariuki. “It will spur private sector investments in developing solar generation capacity in the G5 Sahel countries. This will provide an opportunity to realize the African Development Bank’s vision of the Desert to Power initiative as an integral part of the solution for tackling climate change in the Sahel. The timing of the approval is also perfect, coming just before COP26.”
The project is expected to mobilize almost $1 billion over a seven-year period, with projects divided into three categories: grid upgrades and storage, to allow for uptake of solar energy; financing for independent power producers to build new solar plants; and technical assistance to support the creation of stable environments for investment.
“We are proud to be part of this innovative project with our partners at the African Development Bank,” said GCF Deputy Executive Director Javier Manzanares. “The Desert to Power G5 Sahel Facility has the potential to make an enormous difference in people’s lives across the Sahel by tapping into the immense potential of solar energy, generating cheaper, reliable, and low-emission electricity. GCF’s catalytic financing alongside that of the African Development Bank and the private sector will together mobilise nearly $1 billion for this truly transformative project.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/11/solar-supply-demand-and-a-foreign-policy-shakeup/,"MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 11, 2021","Solar supply, demand, and a foreign policy shakeup","From pv magazine 10/2021
In June, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued a Withhold Release Order (WRO) against the world’s largest silicon metal manufacturer, Hoshine Silicon Industry, and its subsidiaries, without granting a grace period. Manufacturers exporting goods to the United States are required to provide documents on trade, manufacturing, and shipping methods of the products.
InfoLink’s research showed that some modules which had arrived in the U.S. between July and September were detained or sent back. As the FAQ regarding WRO does not include a list of required papers, it remains difficult for manufacturers to provide certificates of origin for silicon and silicon powder. Manufacturers mostly provide a declaration statement, PO, and bank slip for product traceability; no manufacturer has thus far provided a certificate of origin for silicon powder. In the face of increasingly high export risks, some Tier-1 module manufacturers have temporarily stopped shipments to the U.S. and have lowered their annual targets to the country.
Southeast Asia-based facilities, where manufacturers mainly ship products to the U.S., saw significantly lower OEM and in-house capacity utilization, which fell to 50% to 70% in September.
In addition to the impacts of the WRO, a group consisting of U.S. solar manufacturers filed petitions to the U.S. Department of Commerce in August, requesting investigations into Chinese cell and module companies circumventing tariffs by manufacturing in Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand. While measures against the circumvention remain unclear, some Chinese manufacturers expect to build a complete supply chain overseas, while other manufacturers are in wait-and-see mode, slowing their capacity expansion projects in Southeast Asia for now.
Solar manufacturers in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are watching closely for opportunities amid the China-U.S. trade dispute. According to our research, some manufacturers may shift some OEM orders to other manufacturers overseas. In fact, some have started to arrange this, or will come up with solutions before policy details are announced.
Indian optimism
Module demand in India stood at 4.5 GW to 4.8 GW in the first half, despite the Covid-19 pandemic and price increases across the supply chain, growing by more than double from 2.2 GW in the corresponding period last year.
Moreover, the 14.5% safeguard duty expired at the end of July, allowing a window to avoid punitive tariffs, as no additional tariffs were introduced by mid-September, before the basic customs duty is imposed in April 2022. India thus becomes a key market for module manufacturers in the second half of the year. Strong demand is expected in the fourth quarter to the first quarter of 2022, with module demand in the second half of this year likely to exceed 5.5 GW.
However, high module prices and ocean freight rates will affect the internal rate of return (IRR) of projects worldwide. It is reported that the Indian government will allow projects to postpone installation, although official documents have yet to be released as of mid-September.
Demand outlook
The United States and India saw more policy changes this year. Xinjiang-related legislation and the Chinese circumvention issue in the former case caused uncertainties for the market, slowing Chinese module makers’ shipment activities to the United States. Therefore, demand is slightly lower than expected in the last quarter due to module supply, and is estimated to come in at 12 GW to 13 GW. Driven by the window period of punitive tariffs in India, module demand is likely to surpass 5.5 GW in the second half.
Foreign policy changes aside, expensive modules and shipping rates will hit project returns in China and abroad. Experience in previous years suggests that inventory draw normally begins after the end of the summer holidays in Europe. This year, however, module inventory draw is moderate, thanks to high module prices and shipping delays. EU module demand in the second half is therefore projected to be around 20 GW.
End users’ low acceptability for module price increases in China and overseas markets led to the postponement of some orders to the first half of 2022. Demand in the fourth quarter therefore turns from optimistic to uncertain. With high module prices, demand this year is expected to hit 165 GW to 170 GW. In 2022, demand will be sustained in the first half by projects deferred from this year, enabling prices in the supply chain to hold ground instead of turning weak, as forecast earlier.
Driven by the province-wide promotion of distributed PV projects, Chinese demand looks bright and will likely grow robustly next year. By then, China’s share of global PV demand may grow even further. In light of this, InfoLink raises its demand forecast to 190 GW for 2022.
As per observations in the first half, end users could hardly accept glass-backsheet modules rated beyond 500 W being priced higher than CNY 1.80/W ($0.28/W), with demand being impacted to some extent. Given trade disputes, the time required for new polysilicon capacity to come online, and the impact of raw material factors on module prices, module makers are conservative about price quotes for 2022.
For now, 182 mm and 210 mm glass-backsheet modules are projected to stay at CNY 1.78-1.80/W and $ 0.245-0.25/W. In the fourth quarter, the FOB prices of glass-glass modules rated beyond 500 W in the U.S. range from $0.29/W to $0.30/W. Prices for 182 mm and 210 mm glass-backsheet modules in India saw little difference from the international level, sitting at $0.245-$0.255/W. The rate of price decline in the first half of 2022 will be rather slow. The profits of module makers are likely to recover in the first half of next year when polysilicon and wafer prices begin to slip.

Module prices have stabilized in recent weeks and have even come down for most technologies. I attribute this to a drop in demand in the summer holidays on the one hand and the approaching end of the quarter on the other. Some larger volumes of modules have been released onto the market, which means availability is currently good, and prices are under some pressure as a result. Given that this is inventory adjustment and thus a short-term effect, I expect an upward correction in coming months. It is therefore unlikely that we will see the holding price increase of some 6% to 9% since the beginning of the year again.

The price that has been unchanged since January is in the low-cost category – low-power modules, factory seconds and secondhand panels – as these are usually local offers generally untied to container shipments from Asia.
But how can we step back from the large Chinese manufacturers in other product groups, and break free from prices dictated by freight and shipping companies?
Since Asian manufacturers began their conquest of Europe over a decade ago, all attempts by domestic producers to establish a competitive mass-market solar module have failed. Even the EU Commission’s protectionist regulation of the import of cells and modules from China from 2013-18 couldn’t save domestic industry.
Today, there is no longer any serious production capacity in the EU beyond final module assembly. Silicon, wafers, cells, glass, films, frames, cables and junction boxes are sourced from Asia or outside the EU. Some formerly respected German brands limit themselves to the words “Engineered in Germany” or “German warranty” in their data sheets, since the complete module or at least the finished laminate comes from Asia, and only the frame is pressed domestically.
Absent supply chain
Such “made in Europe” products aren’t much more expensive than Chinese modules, but they have no transport cost advantage because all of the materials come from Asia, too. The situation is not much better for local module manufacturers that still do the laminating themselves – they also import almost all of their upstream products from Asia.
Today, module production itself is highly automated, meaning personnel costs are low. The only disadvantages over Chinese production are energy costs and environmental regulations. But these can be eliminated with a little effort and innovation. The toughest nut to crack – at least over the short to medium term – is the procurement problem for materials. Vertical integration of a large number of production steps, if possible at one location, would be the solution, as would a large production capacity to achieve economies of scale. But this is precisely the crux of the problem, and why European players have fallen by the wayside, or never moved beyond the status of assemblers.
Whether Meyer Burger, the latest candidate in the race for a seat at the table among the otherwise Asia-dominated manufacturers, will succeed in doing the seemingly impossible, remains highly questionable. At least, I’ve been hard pressed to find anyone in the industry over the past few weeks who can imagine that the Swiss company will succeed in capturing a meaningful share of the market with its current setup and price structure. At present, the manufacturer is also struggling with the availability and cost of its raw materials, which has led to delayed delivery of module lots ordered many months ago, and to prices that are nearly double those of the large Tier-1 manufacturers. Even the company’s claim of better module quality and somewhat higher yields through the use of heterojunction technology, as well as the local producer bonus, are not enough to justify much higher module costs, in my opinion.
The Swiss company may be betting on the outcome of the German federal elections in September, for an associated change of government may create significantly better market conditions for domestic, high-priced products. A much higher CO2 price, for instance, could be a game changer. The government would also have to sweeten the pot considerably with regard to renewable energy infrastructure projects to enable the large-scale production of silicon and wafers. But what is clear is that without change, China will continue to dominate the European solar scene.

There was excellent news on Friday for France’s solar PV industry after the new, 34-page decree allowing for a fixed feed-in tariff (FIT) for all PV systems up to 500 kW in size, was published in France’s Official Journal, a day after the Minister of Ecological Transition, Barbara Pompili, announced its signature.
In article 1 of the decree, it has been specified that any PV installations that reached commercial operation, or that have already produced electricity within the framework of a commercial contract before the date of publication of the new decree, may not profit from a purchase contract under the conditions set out in it.
For those PV installations 100 kWp in size and above, only those with a carbon footprint below 550 kg eq CO2/kWp will benefit from a purchase contract. “We fought for this barrier to entry to be maintained on small power installations, in order to ensure that projects are carried out by manufacturers offering quality products in terms of safety, durability and traceability,” Xavier Daval, president of KiloWattSol and president of SER-Soler told pv magazine France.
The carbon footprint calculation method is presented in Annex 6.
Solar PV projects must be completed by a deadline defined by the later of the following two dates:
If these deadlines are exceeded, the duration of the purchase contracts will be reduced by the time it is exceeded.
The PV project may also be shut down after the contract has expired.
As announced by the Minister of Ecological Transition a few days ago, the tariff has been set at €98/MWh. “While the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance asked for less, it is a great success on the part of the Minister and the Syndicat des énergies renouvelables, which will ensure the profitability of projects in the south as well as in the north,” said Xavier Daval.
In accordance with the operation of the open-window system, tariffs will be renegotiated every quarter according to the capacities installed.
The bonus for landscape integration (in order to promote the use of solar tiles) are set as follows:
The annual energy purchased by the co-contractor must be equal to the energy produced by the PV installation, minus the consumption of the auxiliary equipment necessary for its operation during the production period and, where applicable, the energy is used for self-consumption as defined in Article L. 315-1 or L. 315-2 of the Energy Code and injected into the public distribution network.
It is calculated from the commencement date of the start of the purchase contract and is capped. The ceiling is defined as:
“We did not manage to maintain the 1,150-hour threshold, which we wanted, but it is a concession granted in return for the tariff we managed to impose,” comments Xavier Daval.
A PV installation meets the general installation criteria when it fulfills one of the following conditions:

Construction is slated to commence in the fourth quarter of next year, while operations are expected to start by the end of 2023. Amplants’ goal is to achieve carbon neutrality across all its operations by 2040.
CEO Natasha Viljoen added that they are excited about the prospect of eventually using solar energy to produce green hydrogen at Mogalakwena as part of a broader project to convert mine haul trucks to run on zero-emission hydrogen fuel cells.
“Not only will this reduce our environmental footprint, but these technologies rely on platinum group metals (PGMs), which are an essential component in proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells and PEM hydrogen electrolysers. In turn, this could stimulate additional future demand for PCMs as both technologies roll out,” she said.
Recently, South Africa raised the threshold for distributed generation to 100MW. Consequently, large-scale PV plants of up to 100 MW can now be built without requesting a license through a simplified procedure with the national regulator.

Referred to as the Solara4 project during its development and construction, the power plant was renamed the Riccardo Totta Photovoltaic Plant at an inauguration ceremony held last week, attended by stakeholders from across the project, as well as Portuguese minister of environment and climate action João Pedro Matos Fernandes, Secretary of State for Energy João Galamba and local Mayor Paulo Paulino. The plant takes its name from an Italian engineer and father of Maurizio Totta, the project’s landowner.
At 219 MW, Riccardo Totta PV plant is the largest solar power plant in Portugal, and among the largest unsubsidized projects built so far in Europe. Developers WElink and China Triumph International Engineering Co. Ltd. (CTIEC) have signed a long-term PPA with Spanish company Audax for energy produced at the site. Paulino also noted that the project is the largest investment ever made in the municipality of Alcoutim, and WElink stated that it came in under budget, costing €170 million against a scheduled investment of €200 million.
Chinese manufacturer Jetion supplied the PV modules for the project, and China National Building Materials acted as engineering, procurement, and construction contractor. Originally expected to be completed in September 2019, the project was hit with multiple delays including a Covid-19 outbreak among construction workers at the site. WElink and CTIEC have previously collaborated on several projects in Spain and Portugal, including on the 46 MW Ourika Project completed in 2018, which Paz reports is performing beyond expectations.
Portugal is hoping that the completion of the Riccardo Totta project will help it to weather the increasing energy prices many in Europe are bracing for as we head into winter. “We are deeply concerned with the increase in the price of gas, a fuel that continues to be a significant source of energy production in Portugal and which contributes to setting the price of electricity,” said Matos-Fernandes. “However, we know very well how to stave off high prices: by supporting projects like this one”
The project created as many as 500 local jobs during its construction, and will continue to employ 15-20 during its operational phase. The developer also spoke of plans to integrate energy storage at the site later on, potentially reducing the cost of energy even further. “Our goal is to continue to develop its potential by implementing storage systems that will be crucial to revolutionising the country’s energy landscape, namely in terms of optimising the cost of energy”, said Hugo Paz, project director for the Iberian Peninsula at WElink.

According to a press release, REC Group was acquired from its previous owner China National Bluestar Group for a value of US$771 million.
Having earlier this year announced plans to invest close to $10 billion in establishing a “fully integrated, end-to-end renewable energy ecosystem”, RNES is moving forward with plans up and down the solar supply chain, having also this week announced the acquisition of a 40% stake in engineering, procurement and construction supplier Sterling and Wilson.
RNES plans to integrate REC’s production technology in its plans for a vertically integrated, silicon-to-module manufacturing site in Jamnagar, India. REC Group additionally stated that its new owner’s financial strength will help it to realize plans to expand its current base of around 2 GW PV cell and module production capacity located in Singapore to 5 GW over the next two to three years, a new 2 GW cells and module facility in France, and another 1 GW module facility in the U.S.
Currently, REC has three manufacturing facilities – two in Norway for making solar-grade polysilicon and one in Singapore for producing PV cells and modules, and a global workforce of over 1,300 employees.
“In India, Reliance plans to use this industry leading technology in their fully integrated, metallic Silicon to PV Panel manufacturing giga factory at Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex, Jamnagar initially starting with 4 GW per annum capacity and eventually growing to 10 GW per annum,” read the press release.
“Reliance’s deep expertise of scale, project execution and operational excellence coupled with REC’s technology will facilitate the establishment of state-of-the-art next-generation fully integrated PV manufacturing facility at Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex and subsequently replicate such complexes around the world,” it continued.
Reliance Industries is led by Mukesh Ambani, currently ranked by Bloomberg as the 11th richest person in the world. The group reported net profits of $7.4 billion for the year ending March 31 2021, primarily from activities in the fossil fuel segment. In June, Ambani announced plans to invest up to $10 billion in a new venture across the renewable energy industry, including plans to span the entire solar supply chain, as well as make investments in energy storage and hydrogen.

Founder of Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) and more recently of Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), Dr. Andrew Forrest yesterday made a joint announcement with Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk in the Port of Gladstone, that FFI will build the world’s largest green-energy infrastructure and equipment-manufacturing facility in Central Queensland.
FFI will invest $115 million in the first step of a more than $1 billion operation that will double the world’s green hydrogen-production ability.
With the first electrolysers rolling off the production line by 2023 it will soon produce 2 GW of electrolyser capacity per annum.
Forrest constantly communicates the urgency of ramping up green energy production: “We will not allow the world to keep on cooking — we will not allow our children to inherit a much less stable environment,” he said on Sunday with now-familiar fervor.
We're working with Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest to build the world's largest hydrogen-equipment manufacturing facility 🙌 pic.twitter.com/wQXWt8Lnr1
— Annastacia Palaszczuk (@AnnastaciaMP) October 10, 2021

Only two weeks ago, Forrest formed a global green hydrogen organization, GH2, to be chaired by former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, with the goal of ensuring that by 2050, a quarter of the world’s energy comes from green hydrogen.
FFI itself aims to produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030, much of which it intends to integrate into the production processes of heavy industry, such as steelmaking, to displace fossil fuel use.
Just last week, the billionaire known as “Twiggy”, and Julie Shuttleworth, Chief Executive of FFI — a subsidiary of FMG — announced FFI had acquired a majority share in Netherlands-based High yield Energy Technologies (HyET) Group, which counts among its assets the solar PV module manufacturer HyET Solar.
FFI’s plans to expand the group’s solar manufacturing capability include a 1 GW manufacturing plant in Australia producing HyET lightweight Powerfoil flexible solar modules destined for utility-scale solar farms and building-integrated PV applications.
FFI will also support HyET’s intention to ramp up to 900 MW production in the Netherlands
By manufacturing the flexible solar modules and electrolysers at immense scale, FFI aims to drive down the cost of both products and hasten the delivery of affordable green energy to the world.
The current cost of electrolysers is one factor keeping the price of producing green hydrogen above that of hydrogen produced using natural gas.
Electrolysers split water into its component hydrogen and oxygen molecules; when powered by renewables such as solar and wind, they produce emissions-free hydrogen that can be used to transition otherwise hard-to-abate industrial processes away from fossil fuels.
Cheap hydrogen, produced by excess renewable electricity justifies further processing into ammonia or compression for export.
The International Energy Agency identified shortages in worldwide electrolyser manufacturing capacity, which it calculated at 3 GW a year in 2020, as a threat to the many green hydrogen projects in the global pipeline.
Last year, Europe dominated worldwide capacity with about 60% of electrolyser production, and China pretty much controlled the rest, with 35%.
“FFI’s goal is to become the world’s leading, integrated, fully renewable energy and green products company, powering the Australian economy and creating jobs for Australia as we transition away from fossil fuels,” Shuttleworth said.
Forrest added that the Queensland facility “is a critical step in Fortescue’s transition from a highly successful pure-play iron ore producer to an even more successful green renewables and resources powerhouse.”
The Queensland plant, to be built in Aldoga, 25 kilometers west of Gladstone, will manufacture not only electrolysers, but cabling and wind turbines to drive the production of green hydrogen for global markets.

Forrest said that over the past 15 months he had researched 62 countries to decide on the best location for producing his envisaged full hydrogen kit, and found, “Queensland has the beautiful combination of wind and solar and you have a hard-working, educated people,” he said at yesterday’s event. He also lauded the Queensland Government for already steering the state “into a green hydrogen future”.
Gladstone’s industrial port is well-positioned to take Australian-made electrolysers to the world. Palaszczuk noted its proximity to Asia and Queensland’s already good trading relationships with Asian economies.
In 2019, Queensland exported its first shipment of green hydrogen to Japan as part of a trial jointly conducted by the Queensland University of Technology and JXTG, a Japanese petroleum conglomerate.
Queensland has since announced several hydrogen projects on its sun-drenched turf, but nothing like this.
The FFI manufacturing facility is expected to directly create some 150 jobs during construction and 53 ongoing jobs when operational, but Forrest said the knock-on effects of imminently available, affordable green hydrogen generation will bring manufacturing “roaring back to regional Australia”, creating thousands of jobs.

Iron flow battery manufacturer ESS Inc. has been in the news lately, most recently for releasing an updated version of its product guarantee.
Munich RE, one of the world’s largest reinsurance companies, also updated its insurance policy for ESS to address customer concerns over technology risk. ESS told pv magazine USA that the new policy covers the battery modules and electrolyte management system, as well any needed repairs or replacement for the first 10 years of the system’s life. ESS manufactures these components itself.

The product’s pump and motor drives have an expected lifetime of 19-22 years. The industrial computer, which was described as “inexpensive,” can be expected to be replaced every 5-7 years. ESS offers an O&M service contract after the 10-year mark.
But even more striking is the battery’s expected longevity. Much like the grid’s oldest assets, (some of which were first built in the 1890s), ESS batteries show the potential to soldier on for many decades. While the ESS battery systems have a prescribed design life of 25 years, the battery modules, electrolyte, plumbing, and other components may well last for decades longer with proper maintenance.
For one thing, the battery is expected to experience zero degradation over 20,000 cycles. By design, iron flow batteries circulate liquid electrolytes to charge and discharge electrons using a process called a redox reaction, which represents a gain of electrons (reduction), and a loss of electrons (oxidation). ESS uses the same electrolyte on both the negative and positive sides, eliminating possible cross-contamination and degradation. As a result, ESS chemistry remains stable for an almost unlimited number of deep-cycle charge and discharge cycles.
Another reason for the expected long operating life is that ESS batteries use a “proton pump” to balance and maintain electrolyte health over the life of the asset.
The pump connects to the tank and passively mixes unwanted hydrogen back into the solution. Doing so maintains the balance of pH and states of charge in the liquid electrolyte circulating through the system.
In human terms, the battery is the heart, the electrolyte is the blood, and the proton pump is the kidney, which keeps everything in balance.
The pump itself is expected to be a key commercial differentiator for ESS. Other flow chemistries need to come offline regularly to rebalance their electrolytes. Not so with the ESS design.
In the unlikely event that the battery is to be decommissioned, the system and all of its components can be substantially recycled.
Any non-ESS manufactured system components come with third-party warranties. The full warranty wasn’t available to be distributed via pv magazine USA.
The company currently offers two products, the single shipping container Energy Warehouse and a string of warehouse units in an Energy Center.
One Energy Warehouse shipping container holds 400-600kWh of storage capacity and can be configured with variable power to provide storage durations of 4-12 hours. That makes the power rating configurable from 50-90 kW. The round-trip efficiency is 70-75%, DC-DC. Each battery weighs 16,000 kg dry, and as much as 38,000 kg after it’s filled with the electrolyte.
For larger volumes of energy storage, ESS will string together multiple batteries in what it calls an Energy Center. At this larger scale, ESS batteries take up some real estate. One acre of batteries holds up to 6 MW/90 MWh, providing up to 12 hours discharge at rated power. These large battery centers are expected to have fast, easy permitting due to the lack of hazmat concerns as well as non-flammable, non-explosive materials.
But the most important news of the day – product sales news – shows that ESS has been busy.
To support its growth, ESS announced that they were to become a publicly listed company through a SPAC merger with ACON S2 Acquisition Corp this past May. And in a great coup, the company will be listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “GWH.”
