Despite the challenging market conditions, the panel maker was able to raise its annual shipments by 31.4% year-on-year to 18.77 GW and its turnover by 18.1% to CNY35.13 billion ($5.38 billion). The revenue growth was directly linked to the increased shipments and a decline in average product prices was pointed out as responsible for the lower than expected income.
The company's operating result climbed 3.2% to CNY1.73 billion ($273.6 million), while net profit fell from CNY898.7 million to CNY230.4 million ($35.3 million). For the profit drop, the manufacturer blamed a $111.2 million loss of change in fair value of convertible senior notes and call option.
As for the fourth quarter of 2020, the operating result plunged year-on-year from CNY 594.8 million to RMB71.6 million. In the period, Jinko also posted a net loss of RMB377.0 million ($57.8 million), which compares to a net profit of RMB369.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Quarterly turnover was CNY9.42 billion ($1.44 billion) and shipments totaled 5,774 MW.
“The continuous volatility in the industrial value chain further highlighted the resilience to risk of integrated manufacturers,” said Jinko CEO, Xiande Li. “Meanwhile, economic uncertainties continued to concentrate key players and heightened competition for “survival of the fittest” and rewarded highly adaptive companies to gain more market share.”
Looking forward, Jinko said that demand for modules will revive once market prices stabilized, and that supply is currently sufficient in most segments of the supply chain. For the first quarter, the manufacturer expects revenue to come in at between $1.18 billion and $1.30 billion and shipments to reach up to 5 GW.
“We expect total shipments in 2021 to grow over 30%, to be in the range of 25 to 30 GW,” Li stated. “By the end of 2021, we expect our in-house annual production capacity of monocrystalline silicon wafers, high-efficiency solar cells and modules to reach 33 GW, 27 GW and 37 GW, respectively.”

The company wants to set up eight production lines for heterojunction cells with a combined capacity of 2 GW by the end of this year. The Huzhou factory is planned to have a total capacity of 6 GW and to require a total investment of CNY5 billion ($763.5 million)
China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced on Thursday the 2021 subsidy plan for solar energy projects. The government has established that there will be no direct incentives from central authorities for either utility-scale or commercial and industrial distributed solar, and that residential PV will still benefit from a FIT of CNY 0.03/kWh, although this support will expire at the end of the year. The NDRC also provided technical information for grid-connection fees across different areas of China for new solar projects.
PV production equipment supplier Jinchen announced on Wednesday it intends to raise funds in the amount of CNY380 million ($59 million) via equity private placement. The company will use net proceeds for the development of its plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technology for heterojunction cell production lines. Jinchen said it aims to develop the capability of independently manufacturing PECVD lines. The private placement has been approved by China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and will take place soon.
Shenzhen-listed China energy company Jiawei Energy announced on Thursday it has sold a large-scale solar project to a subsidiary of state-owned power provider China Huadian Corporation for an undisclosed sum. The facility is located in Gansu province and currently has an installed capacity of 125 MW. A further 75 MW section of the solar park is still under construction. The first two sections of the plant, with a capacity of 100 and 25 MW respectively, are selling power at a feed-in tariff of CNY0.9 and CNY0.8 per KWh.

New research from BloombergNEF suggests that green hydrogen costs could fall 85% by 2050, pushing renewable hydrogen under the $1/kg threshold and undercutting natural gas as well as blue and gray hydrogen production. This new research revised downwards BloombergNEF’s previous 2030 forecast by 13% and its 2050 forecast by 17%. According to the research, the key force behind this accelerating cost decline is the falling cost of solar PV. BloombergNEF expects that solar electricity will be 40% cheaper in 2050 than what it envisaged just two years ago.
The Portuguese government and the European Investment Bank signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding for hydrogen cooperation. “Portugal intends to produce green hydrogen at competitive prices and play a major role in the emerging hydrogen economy,” commented Minister for the Environment and Climate Action João Pedro Matos Fernandes. EIB Vice-President Ricardo Mourinho Félix added that the Luxembourg-based multilateral bank “believe that clean hydrogen has the potential to play an important role … in promoting the green economic recovery in the context of COVID-19.” The signing ceremony took place during the High-Level Conference on Hydrogen, organised by the Portuguese presidency of the Council of the European Union.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/09/vehicle-integrated-pv-for-light-commercial-vehicles/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 9, 2021",Vehicle-integrated PV for light commercial vehicles,"The Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin (ISFH) is developing a light commercial vehicle prototype equipped with vehicle-integrated photovoltaics (VIPV). The VIPV system will be connected to the vehicle's high-voltage electrical system and will be designed to extend its driving range.
The researchers have built the prototype based on the “Work L” small truck, which is manufactured by Germany-based manufacturer StreetScooter GmbH. The vehicles feature a total area of 15 m2 on which 10 PV modules can be deployed.
“The modules have been fabricated by a2-solar, a company with many years of experience in VIPV,” said Robby Peibst, ISFH professor and research coordinator. “So far, the modules are glass-based, reflecting a2-solar's experience in the passenger car sector.”
Peibst told pv magazine that the glass cover has the required surface quality for PV applications. It is also able to withstand stress from hail and extreme temperature changes. However, the weight of the glass-based modules might reduce the permissible payloads for delivery vehicles and trucks, he acknowledged.
“It is therefore a2-solar's development goal within the ‘street' project to integrate a second, foil-based and thus significantly lighter module generation on the commercial vehicle,” Peibst explained, adding that the current glass-based module generation scheme serves as a reference point, with an upgrade to be made by June.
The modules feature silicon heterojunction solar cells provided by Swiss manufacturer Meyer Burger.
“The cells were interconnected with the Smart-Wire Technology at ISFH,” Peibst said. “We think that this technology has a couple of advantages for VIPV, as, besides high efficiency, SHJ cells exhibit a low-temperature coefficient of only -0.2%/K and can be thin and thus partially flexible.”
The Smart Wire interconnection scheme should ensure that all parts of the cell are still electrically connected, even in the case of cracks and mechanical vibration. The 10 modules on the vehicle have a total capacity of 2.18 kW, with around 875 W being deployed on the rooftop alone. According to Peibst, the need to adapt the modules to fit the dimensions of the vehicle is a constraint on efficiency.
“You can see a lot of white areas which are only covered by the back sheet and not with silicon cells,” he said. “When going to half or even shingled cells, we will have more flexibility to fill the areas with silicon, which will strongly improve the module efficiency.”
The consortium behind the project includes the Jülich Institute for Energy and Climate Research, the Helmholtz Center Berlin (HZB), and the MBE Institute of Leibniz University Hannover, as well as German automotive supplier Vitesco Technologies. Their prototype vehicle has energy requirements that are similar to those of passenger cars, at around 19 kWh/100 km.
The research group looked at the irradiation on vehicles based on car-mounted pyranometers to determine the side-to- roof ratio, as well as the impact of dynamic shading. “When assuming a total driving distance of 20,000 km per year, the solar coverage fraction would be over 25%,” Piebst said. “We are currently trying to verify this prediction by extensive test drives.”
The consortium expects a higher annual range extension in more southern regions.
“Our results will demonstrate the attractiveness of vehicle-integrated photovoltaics first for such light commercial vehicles,” Peibst said. “But beyond that, they will also provide important insights for transferring VIPV to other vehicle classes.”
Peibst said that it is difficult to make a purely economic argument for VIPV, given that the depreciation periods for vehicles will be much shorter than those of stationary PV systems. “If you then pay a very low price for grid electricity, for example, as the operator of a large fleet of vehicles, it is really hard to argue with energy savings alone,” he acknowledged.
These difficulties do not preclude VIPV from becoming a bigger market possibility over the medium term, as Peibst pointed to a number of potential factors that could help to facilitate future growth. He noted that manufacturers of refrigerated trucks could reduce their CO2 emissions footprints if they integrate PV, for example.
In general, visible “green labeling” could gain importance among fleet operators, especially municipal operators of bus fleets and waste disposal vehicles. For environmentally minded drivers, VIPV could also simply be an expression of personal values, Peibst added, arguing that automated yet flexible mass production of VIPV modules could drive significant cost reductions, which in turn could open up additional potential applications.
 “My very optimistic forecast for the global annual VIPV market in 2030 would be 5 GW,” Peibst concluded.

The electricity will be provided by a solar park with an unspecified capacity that Emesco is building on a property located close to the mine. “Emesco will sell the power generated to Trevali at a fixed rate that is expected to reduce energy costs by18% over the fifteen-year term of the agreement,” Trevali said, without disclosing more information on the deal.
The mining company added that the plant will cover around 30% of the mine's electricity demand and that this percentage may be raised depending on the expansion of the mining activities.
The mine is located in the homonymous municipality, in the Karas Region of southern Namibia. It is one of the largest and most important zinc mines in the country.
Namibia had around 145 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2020, according to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency. No new PV capacity was deployed in the country in the past year.
Namibia’s state-owned electric utility NamPower  is aiming to install 220 MW of renewables capacity, including 40 MW of solar.
In 2019, the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on Energy revealed the governments of Namibia and Botswana had started discussing a plan to develop 5 GW of solar capacity over the next two decades.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/09/italy-launches-first-solar-energy-community-in-social-housing-project/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,ITALY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"APRIL 9, 2021",Italy launches first solar energy community in social housing project,"A 48-apartment building in the Reggio Emilia province in northern Italy will help assess an energy community business model specifically targeting social housing. The testing phase, which should end by December 2022, will show if and how the model being implemented in the Scandiano municipality will be replicable.
“The project foresees a 60 kW PV system on the roof. Together with a 115.2 kWh storage system, it will be installed by the end of 2021,” project leader Sauro Saraceni told pv magazine. “Next year an EV fleet will be introduced, while consumption monitoring, which began in September 2020, will continue till the end of 2022. That’s to understand eventual complexities arising on the ground,”
Saraceni, who works for ART-ER, an Emilia-Romagna consortium aiming to promote and coordinate sustainable growth of the region, said Scandiano would be an example of PV installations and mobility solutions not just in the region but in the entire country. “Among other residential options, social housing is the one suffering the most from energy poverty,” Saraceni stressed, adding that the region aims to extend this model and promote it to other social housing projects in the coming years.
According to preliminary estimates, the PV and storage system will lead to a 60% reduction in electricity consumption.
The three institutions responsible for preliminary analysis — ART-ER, the Italian research agency ENEA and the University of Bologna — are currently modeling the consumption profiles collected by Enel X, a provider of demand response owned by Italian utility Enel. Meanwhile, ACER Reggio Emilia, the social housing company managing the apartment building, is speaking with potential partners to install a PV and storage system by the end of 2021. Enel X will also supply non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM)  devices.
The idea is to offer a fleet of cars shared among the building's residents. “We are analyzing this option with a private partner. The cars, which will be charged with the energy produced by the PV installation, will be offered under a long-term rental contract,” said Saraceni.
Mobility and the residential sector will be two key pillars in Emilia-Romagna’s strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
ENEA is contributing through scenario analysis. “We are supporting with studies on how car sharing is reinforcing the renewable energy community,” Piero De Sabbata, responsible of the CROSS-TEC laboratory at ENEA, told pv magazine.
The broader refurbishing will benefit from the so-called SuperBonus (110% fiscal break) and other pre-existing schemes.
“One-third of the PV installation will be financed through the SuperBonus, while the rest through the usual 50% tax break. The storage will be completely financed through the SuperBonus”, Saraceni said, adding that the idea for the project was sketched in 2018 and launched in 2019.
The owners of the 48 apartments will be in charge of the remaining costs. Twenty apartments are privately owned; the municipality of Scandiano owns the other 28.
The entire financing operation will be managed by the local social housing company.
The rules about renewable energy communities (RECs), which entered into force in Italy last year, simplified this complex collective self-consumption project.
“We started with a focus on the energy sharing business model, together with the department of electrical, electronic and information engineering of the University of Bologna, analyzing what were the optimal conditions for self-consumption,” said De Sabbata. “With the new law, it is no longer a theoretical exercise. We can practically implement this model.”
According to De Sabbata, the main question now is to understand the residents' consumption profiles and whether awareness campaigns can help them understand their role in the feasibility of similar projects.
“This mobility model would be more successful if the majority of residents would mostly work from home or would not work at all, being for instance retired. This is part of a modeling exercise that can be completed before starting the building refactoring, aimed at meeting the consumption profiles with the production capacity of the installation, as much as with the load profile of the charging stations,” said De Sabbata.
Apart from the focus on mobility and data collection, ENEA is also providing support by analyzing consumption patterns and future use of technologically advanced solutions. “Heat pumps are an example of solutions that can improve the load curve during the day,” De Sabbata concluded.

PCMs are able to absorb, store and release large amounts of latent heat over a defined temperature range and have often been used, at the research level, for PV module cooling.
“Our technique will be particularly suitable for the hot climatic region, where the BIPV- PCM system can be beneficial economically,” research co-author Digvijay Singh told pv magazine. “However, optimization of PCM quantity will be required depending upon the region.”
The researchers stressed that the use of PCMs in BIPV systems would not only reduce the panels operating temperatures but also have a positive impact on the thermal comfort inside the buildings. Four kinds of PCMs were used in the experiment and were encapsulated with the PV system and the building envelopes under two configurations, which they defined as “naturally or forced ventilated” and “non-ventilated.”
The Indian group used organic, inorganic, eutectic PCMs and a PCM mixed with nanoparticles. The experiment showed that the PCMs are able to delay the heat flux rate through the building envelopes. “Due to direct encapsulation of PCMs with PV modules, heat flux rate through the envelopes increases when compared with ventilated air gap and insulation provided between the PCMs and PV modules,” it explained.
The academics found that the organic PCMs were able to reduce module temperature by up to 15 degrees Celsius, which they described as the lowest performance among the four materials. The PCM mixed with nanoparticles offered the best performance by lowering the panel temperature by up to 22 degrees Celsius, while inorganic and eutectic PCMs both achieved a maximum reduction of 18 degrees Celsius.
“A significant reduction in temperature of modules and building envelopes occurs in both the categories is observed,” they asserted. “However, the implementation of BIPV-PCM at a large scale and its economic viability is to be examined by the researchers in upcoming years.”
According to Singh, the proposed technology may also be applied to conventional solar panels, although it has only been tested on a limited amount of BIPV systems thus far.
The experiment was described in the study “Application of phase change material in building integrated photovoltaics: A review”, published in materials today: PROCEEDINGS.

Transdev has continued its transition to zero-emission vehicles in Australia, adding two more electric buses to its fleets in Brisbane and Sydney, after Melbourne-based bus manufacturer Volgren delivered four of its electric vehicles to the public transport operator earlier this month.
Transdev, which operates public transport systems in 17 countries, has already introduced five new electric buses to its fleets in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. Transdev Australasia CEO Luke Agati said the Brisbane buses would be 100% powered by sustainable solar energy from a rooftop solar facility and battery storage system at its Capalaba depot.
The company said the PV-powered “green mobility megawall” can generate up to 159,000 kWh of renewable energy annually and is combined with 135 kWh hours of battery storage.
“Averaging more than 280 days of sunshine per year, Queensland well and truly lives up to its reputation as the Sunshine State, and we are excited to be bringing this clean, green, modern vehicle to Brisbane,” Agati said. “Globally, Transdev is a leader in zero-emissions mobility and work is underway to introduce new fleet and innovations to Australia and New Zealand over the coming months. Research, testing and design for our future zero-emissions fleet will be led from our newly opened Maintenance and Engineering Centre of Excellence, also based at our Capalaba depot.”
The new electric buses were built at Volgren’s factory in Melbourne. They used all Australian parts, other than the chassis and the 348 kW lithium phosphate battery, which were manufactured by Chinese company BYD.
Volgren Engineering Manager Brenton McCallum said the 39-seat buses have an average range of 250 km over the life of the battery, and up to 300 km earlier in its life. However, the Volgren bus, which is being tested in Melbourne in partnership with the Victorian state government, has exceeded that estimation, travelling nearly 1,000 km on just two charges.
Agati said the decision to manufacture the buses locally was an acknowledgement of the skill and expertise of Australia’s local bus manufacturing sector.
“Australia is on the cusp of an e-mobility revolution in public transport,” he said. “We want to see more Australians travelling on zero-emissions electric and hydrogen-powered buses, and we want Australian bus manufacturers to lead the journey with us.”
The delivery of the new buses comes just weeks after the first fully Australian designed and built electric bus was put to the test in Sydney. The trial is part of the New South Wales government’s push to replace all of its 8,000 diesel buses with electric ones by 2030.
The Victorian government is also accelerating its switch to electric buses. Last year, it announced AUD 20 million ($15.2 million), three-year statewide trial aimed at transitioning to a zero-emission bus fleet.

A partnership between the University of Newcastle (UON) and Southern Green Gas (SGG) has managed to develop a state-of-the-art green hydrogen fuel which was demonstrated yesterday in Hyundai’s Nexo Hydrogen fuel cell SUV. 
The technology extracts pure water from air and then uses green energy generated from solar PV to split it into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis, before said hydrogen gas can be used to fuel the car. 
“We’ve worked with Southern Green Gas to develop the ability to manufacture green hydrogen at a lab-scale, the results of which we’re seeing demonstrated here today in the Hyundai hydrogen vehicle,” said Behdad Moghtaderi of UON. “Seeing this fuel hit the roads is a proud moment for my team, who have worked to perfect it over several years. We’re now looking forward to scaling this technology, working with Southern Green Gas toward commercial rollout and a wide range of possible applications.” 
What is more, the partners are not limiting themselves to hydrogen. Their remit, with the help of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the New South Wales government, is the creation of carbon-neutral energy from Australian research and development and renewable resources. In addition to hydrogen fuel, they’re also developing manufacturing capability across other green fuels, such as green methane produced by combining hydrogen with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 
The managing director of Southern Green Gas, Rohan Gillespie, said, “Renewable methane has enormous potential to decarbonise the global mobility sector. We believe this technology represents an important pathway in achieving zero emissions driving worldwide and we are excited to work with our technology partners to make this vision a reality.” 
This vision, according to Gillespie, is to use this homegrown technology to deliver green methane, clean natural gas, to the world. The carbon-neutral methane displaces fossil fuel-based natural gas. “So what we do” continues Gillespie, is use the “carbon dioxide we extract from the atmosphere” to offset the carbon that is released when the methane is used. “So our methane can be used in existing gas-fired power stations, just like natural gas, but when it emits CO2 it’s offset by the CO2 we’ve already extracted by the atmosphere, so it’s carbon neutral.” 
Of course, this green methane can also be turned back into hydrogen, should the end-user want it that way. 
Interestingly, SGG’s specialty gas supplier is Coregas, the largest Australian-owned gases company, and a company that only last month received funding from the New South Wales government to develop a hydrogen refuelling station at the Port Kembla site of BlueScope Steelworks. The station will work to support the introduction of zero-emission hydrogen fleet vehicles in the region and greater New South Wales.
Coregas’ executive general manager, Alan Watkins, said the company was delighted to provide equipment and gas testing “of hydrogen generated by the technology, which passed with flying colours. We see an important future for clean gases powering the world’s electric vehicles, be they battery or hydrogen fuel cell.” 
The demonstration took place at Hyundai Australia’s hydrogen refuelling station in Bennelong, Sydney.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/09/africas-solarized-digitalization-agenda/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,NORTHERN AFRICA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA",,"APRIL 9, 2021",Africa’s solarized digitalization agenda,"Ms. Amina Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations said developing a just economic model that embraced renewable energy, green and resilient infrastructure, and digitalization, while protecting natural resources by broadening partnerships for science, technology, and innovation could unleash the region’s green potential and fuel economic transformation.
According to a paper titled “Harnessing Emerging Technologies: the cases of Artificial Intelligence and Nanotechnology,” provided by Victor Konde, Scientific Affairs Officer at the United Nations:
However, as UNCTAD noted, China and the United States currently own 75% of patents on blockchain, account for half of global spending on IoT and their firms account for three quarters of the global market of commercial cloud computing. As a result, China and the United States account for 90% of the 70 largest digital platforms, while Africa and Latin America account for a combined share of about 1%.
“During the past years, UNECA has undertaken rigorous policy research and has provided policy advice to member States on several emerging technologies, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and nanotechnology… With US Internet giants Google and Facebook spending billions trying to get more people online in Africa against a backlash from governments trying to shut down access,” wrote Konde.
“Africa could expand its economy by a staggering $1.5 trillion dollars, by capturing just 10% of the speedily growing artificial intelligence (AI) market, set to reach $15.7 trillion by 2030,” said Vera Songwe, UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) during the Forum.
Africa is the second largest continent in the world in terms of both territory and population (1.3 billion). Cryptocurrency there is in big demand because:
During 2020, monthly cryptocurrency transfers that are traded person-to-person on 747 million mobile phones to and from Africa under $10,000 (€8,500) shot up by 55%, reaching a peak of $316 million in June. They traded with a large margin that reached up to 70% due to the small number of virtual currency retailers. Individuals and small businesses in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya accounted for most of this trading activity, according to Chainalysis.
China is the largest trading partner of many African countries. It has been investing ($46 billion in 2018, according to the UNCTAD) since the mid-2000’s into Africa’s technology, communications, and finance infrastructure, as well as blockchain technology education.
About 70% of the mobile network layers and more than 50% of the mobile handsets in Africa are made by Chinese telecommunications company Huawei. Already, Egypt, Kenya, Rwanda, and Eswatini are researching whether to adapt to Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC); South Africa, as part of Russia’s multinational digital currency initiative is also piloting CBDC on China’s mobile digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) system supported by China’s Blockchain Service Network.
Africa has a very high deficit in access to modern energy which is needed for digitalization, even though it has abundant energy resources, including solar energy, as it receives more hours of bright sunshine during the course of the year than any other continent on Earth.
The continent is determined to power its digital future with green energies, because it is one of the most vulnerable places to the impacts of global warming, even though it contributes minimally to CO2 emissions. Apart from Angola, Eritrea, Libya, and South Sudan, African countries have ratified the Paris Agreement with ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC).
According to forecasts by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), with the right policies, regulation, governance, and access to financial markets, sub-Saharan Africa could meet up to 67% of its energy needs from renewables by 2030 and provide access to energy to over 70% of Africans (590 million) who are without access currently pointed out Vera Songwe.
Egypt is leading regional efforts to transition to green/solar energy, with the continent experiencing a growth of over 1.8W of new solar installations, mainly driven by nine countries. In a first of its kind project, Egypt recently entered into joint venture with a Chinese company to locally manufacture sand-to-cell solar PV panels. And China has ramped up its overseas green investment to 57% under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) according to research from the International Institute of Green Finance.
Recently, UAE renewable energy company Masdar announced plans to develop solar power in East Africa, while the Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund (EAIF) revealed $100 million investment in hydro and solar power in West Africa.
A sustainable green recovery plan from the pandemic necessitates understanding the links between climate change, health, and inequality; and implementing ambitious climate change policies, which align with the Paris agreement.
These goals provide a critical framework for a recovery from Covid-19, which imposed national lockdowns and international travel bans that accelerated the solarized digitization efforts across African markets. Like digitization, keeping Covid-19 vaccines refrigerated is a challenge where electricity is only available to 70% of the population.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/09/south-korea-wants-to-build-large-scale-pv-along-highways/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 9, 2021",South Korea wants to build large-scale PV along highways,"South Korea is seeing strong development of solar energy projects and is beginning to suffer from limited land availability for the deployment of large-scale solar plants. As a result, the country is seeking alternatives to agricultural surfaces for locating MW-sized arrays. Floating PV is seen as one of the possible solutions, with big projects having been announced in the course of the past two years.
Following the example of the Netherlands, which is also facing strong PV growth and serious issues in identifying locations for solar parks, the Korean government has now also decided to launch a plan to deploy large-scale projects along highways.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) currently operates around 319 solar arrays totaling 149 MW at several idle sites managed by the Korea Expressway Corporation (KEC), which runs the toll roads of South Korea, and has decided to give privates companies the opportunity to lease other idle sites to deploy their projects.
The surface will have to be leased for a 20-year period and developers will have to pay an unspecified usage fee. KEC will offer surfaces on the slopes of the embankment of highways, the green areas around junctions, the rooftops of buildings, and parking lots.
The South Korean government is aiming to deploy around 30 MW of solar in 2021 and 243 MW by 2025. It also wants to add hydrogen fuel cell facilities with a combined capacity of 50 MW.
“We will strive to accelerate the realization of carbon neutrality by continuously expanding the production of new and renewable energy on highways,” said Sang-Heon Lee, manager of the Road Policy Division at the MOLIT.
In late March, the ministry also announced a plan to build solar using railway infrastructure. “Through this agreement, installation of a solar power generation facility to a total scale of 25 MW will be jointly promoted by the end of 2022 — 19.8 MW on a rail yard and a station parking lot and 5.2 MW of solar power on landmark train stations, such as Seoul Station,” the government stated at the time. “Starting with this cooperation project, the MOLIT and Korea Railroad Corporation will continue to expand cooperation with other organizations such as local governments and power companies and increase the scale of railway solar power generation up to 456 MW by 2030.”
In the Netherlands, research institutes and private companies across the densely populated country have tried to prove the feasibility of solar projects on surfaces that do not occupy agricultural land, including dikes, rooftops, road noise barriers, onshore and offshore water surfaces, as well as bike lanes.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/09/new-york-power-authority-tests-1-mwh-zinc-based-battery/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 9, 2021",New York Power Authority tests 1 MWh zinc-based battery,"From pv magazine USA
The New York Power Authority (NYPA) signed an agreement with Zinc8 Energy Solutions and the University at Buffalo to deploy a zinc-air energy storage system (ZESS).
The project will demonstrate a 100 kW/1 MWh ZESS. Vancouver-based Zinc8 won a contract to accelerate the technology in the Innovation Challenge, which is a partnership between the NYPA and the Urban Future Lab at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering.
The Buffalo deployment will provide peak shaving capability and improve campus resiliency. It will also aim to validate the system’s performance reliability and help to determine O&M and life-cycle costs. In addition, the university will explore alternative uses such as emergency backup for campus buildings.
In a story in pv magazine last year, Zinc8 said it had solved the “dendrite problem,” which leads to the clogging of the membranes used in flow batteries. Solving this challenge, along with the broader technology development, cost more than $80 million over the course of 14 years, according to the company. The investments produced a product with a 65% to 70% round trip efficiency.
In simple terms, power from the grid or renewable source is used to generate zinc particles in a zinc regenerator. Oxygen is released to the atmosphere as a by-product. The zinc particles are directed to a storage tank and maintained in potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte until required. Whenever power is needed, the zinc particles are delivered to a power stack, recombining them with oxygen to generate electricity. The zinc oxide (ZnO) by-product is returned to the storage tank for later regeneration.
Under its agreement with Zinc8, the NYPA will contribute to the installation costs and share data generated during the demonstration period. Zinc8 aims to achieve full commercialization of its technology in early 2023.

Tata Power Solar has expanded its cell and module manufacturing capacity in Bangalore, India, with the addition of new lines to produce high-efficiency monocrystalline PERC solar modules. 
The manufacturer has added 230 MW of mono PERC capacity to its 300 MW cell plant and 180 MW of half-cut mono PERC capacity to its existing 400 MW production setup. With this, it has reached an aggregate capacity of 530 MW for cells and 580 MW modules. 
The manufacturer said that the new lines will produce PV modules with bigger wafers (166 mm to 210 mm). They will also offer higher power output, ranging from 440 W to 530 W, with an option for bifacial modules. The company's existing 300 MW cell manufacturing lines process 125 mm and 156 mm monocrystalline and polycrystalline wafers.
India's solar production sector has traditionally been dominated by polycrystalline technology. It is gradually shifting toward high-efficiency monocrystalline modules, in line with global trends and growing domestic demand for such panels. 
Domestic manufacturers are gearing up to cater to growing demand for high-efficiency monocrystalline PERC modules by expanding their production lines. Earlier this year, for example, Premier Solar announced plans to set up a factory in the Indian state of Telangana with an annual cell and module production capacity of 750 MW. The factory will produce polycrystalline and mono PERC cells on wafer sizes up to 210 mm. Rival Websol Energy Systems also plans to embrace PERC technology this fiscal year.
