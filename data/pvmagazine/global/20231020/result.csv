Set out as a national outline plan, the new regulation deals with the capacities of different energy storage facilities, where they can be built and under what conditions.
“The plan will allow the deployment of storage units next to PV plants, gas stations and houses. That will help regulate energy consumption under high demand,” the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure said in a statement. “On the backdrop of the war in Gaza, energy storage can maintain energy for few hours under emergency conditions.”
According to the plan's original papers from January 2023, storage of up to 600 kWh can be built on any land, under some caveats. Bigger storage facilities of up to 5 MWh are allowed on any land, with the exceptions of agricultural land, scenic land, protected land or in the vicinity of a river.
Larger storage facilities, of up to 16 MWh, will only be allowed on land with specific uses. Among permitted lands are those for industrial use, parking lots and public buildings. More extensive storage of more than 16 MWh is not regulated in this program.
In addition, the new regulation sets environmental terms, safety terms, and water safety terms.
“Storage infrastructure improves the potential of renewable energy use,” the ministry added. “This regulation plan was made to support it, as based on it, permits for construction of such facilities can be issued.”

ClassNK has granted Approval in Principle (AiP) to a Multi-Purpose Vessel concept powered by hydrogen, with Mitsui O.S.K Lines (MOL), Onomichi Dockyard, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Japan Engine Corporation conducting the risk assessment. MOL stated this marks the first AiP certification for a ship equipped with a low-speed two-stroke hydrogen-fueled engine as the main propulsion engine, and a two-year demonstration operation is planned from around FY2027.
Toyota plans to use converted fuel cell coaches to transport over 5,000 visitors during the Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024 as part of its guest program. After the Games, these hydrogen coaches will continue their service cycle, benefiting public and private customers in the Ile de France region as a Paris 2024 legacy. Toyota will supply hydrogen fuel cell modules for the conversion of ten used Iveco coaches.
Mabanaft has signed an agreement with Fairplay Towage Group, a tugboat operator, to supply hydrogen to their new tugs in the Port of Hamburg starting in 2025, supporting the maritime industry's shift toward sustainable technologies.
H2 Mobility Deutschland has inaugurated hydrogen charging stations in Dresden and Berg, near Hof, using hydrogen from Rießner Gase produced through PEM electrolysis powered by solar and wind energy. The hydrogen production plant in the Wunsiedel energy park, in collaboration with the Wunsiedel municipal company and Siemens, is Bavaria's largest, currently producing 960 tons of hydrogen per year, with plans for a second expansion phase to increase the electrolyzer's capacity to 17.5 MW.
Protium and its partners have secured over GBP 30 million ($36.5 million) from the Department for Transport and Innovate UK to initiate the Hydrogen Aggregated UK Logistics (HyHAUL) project, which focuses on accelerating hydrogen adoption in the mobility sector, particularly in heavy goods vehicle (HGV) fleets. By 2026, HyHAUL plans to introduce 30 hydrogen fuel cell HGVs to haulage operators, with a further goal of deploying 300 vehicles by 2030.
Wood Mackenzie says that the US Department of Energy's (DOE) $7 billion investment across seven Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (H2Hubs) marks a significant step toward establishing a low-carbon hydrogen economy but is just the initial stage. The hubs' combined production would only contribute 30% to the 10 Mtpa hydrogen supply capacity goal if fully developed, and not all hubs are expected to reach full development by 2030. Each hub has received an initial $20 million for developing detailed project plans over the next 12 to 18 months, with the allocated funding to be disbursed in stages over the next 8 to 12 years.
The Atlantic Council says that the DOE's announcement represents the most substantial public investment in US hydrogen and noted that California and Texas are the hubs of clean hydrogen activities, with a future outlook for blue hydrogen. However, the council mentioned a missed opportunity for hydrogen use in long-haul trucking. To address this, the Atlantic Council made recommendations for policymakers, suggesting a focus on cost sharing for demand-side projects within the H2Hub funding derived from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
Air Liquide has become a partner for six of the seven Hubs supported by the US government, strengthening its commitment to building a robust hydrogen network in the industry. The French industrial gases company aims to scale up its hydrogen initiatives with these partnerships, supporting the expansion of hydrogen infrastructure. Air Liquide has participated as a partner or supporter in these endeavors.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/20/europe-may-go-back-to-normal-inventory-levels-by-june-2024/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,EUROPE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 20, 2023",Europe may go back to ‘normal’ inventory levels by June 2024,"Norwegian consultancy Rystad's recent data indicates around 80 GW of unsold PV panels in European warehouses, raising concerns of a growing solar module glut. These figures have sparked reactions, with some doubting their accuracy, given Rystad's previous estimate of 40 GW in mid-July.
“I was not surprised by the figure itself but by the trend,” Bartosz Majewski, CEO of solar distributor Menlo Electric, told pv magazine. “As a distributor, we have decided to limit inventory as much as possible, in anticipation of the upcoming winter and the price drop that happened at the beginning of July. Even though the prices are decreasing since Q4 last year, they have then been sliding gradually through Q1 and Q2, but in Q3 the prices dropped by 30% in China – this is what really caught many distributors by surprise.”
Majewski said Menlo reduced its module inventory by a factor of 2.5 between July and the end of September.
“Now we are well below our one month's worth of sales,” he explained. “Rystad probably worked on different substocks or categories. For example, if modules are sold from Chinese manufacturer to their European subsidiary, or a distributor, under Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) incoterms, then they are formally exported the moment they are loaded on the ship. This is why they may appear that as European “stocked“ modules, even though they are still at sea and haven’t reached Europe yet. It takes roughly six weeks for these panels to come to Europe. So, if you assume that the Chinese are exporting 8 GW to 10 GW per month, that would mean that there would be about 10 GW to 15 GW worth of stock at sea, not in warehouses.”
Majewski explained that manufacturers have two types of warehouses: one set is “committed to buyers,” where existing contracts await module deployment, and the other is “free,” representing regular stock managed by smaller manufacturers. Additionally, distributors and installers maintain their own stocks, with distributors responsible for a substantial portion, approximately 30%, and installers also holding significant inventories, according to the CEO.
“We do have some clients that have purchased significant stocks in anticipation of this season and some of them are still going through these stocks, although it is already October.”
Filip Sypko, general manager key accounts at Menlo Electric, that the tens of gigawatts of stored solar power in Europe primarily serve residential and commercial installations.
“If you look at the utility scale projects, the ordering and deliveries tend to be happening as we go,” he stated. “There is no significant inventory of bifacial modules in Europe and this is mostly because distributors usually don’t stock up bifacial products.”
He said that numerous modules intended for utility-scale projects are listed as “stocked” even after installation because some solar plants were never completed or connected to the grid. However, these modules are no longer stored in warehouses.
“We have heard of several developers and EPC contractors are having issues in connecting their plants to the grid this year in Europe,” he said.
Most of the modules stored in Europe are based on PERC technology, with the result that the related market segment, mostly residential and C&I installations, is highly saturated.
“There is much oversupply and is very difficult to make positive margins there,” Majewski said. “For n-type products, it is a bit different, as it is still possible to make some positive margins.”
According to Majewski, n-type is currently only €0.01 more expensive than p-type.
“For p-type, it doesn’t matter at what price it was purchased, but at what price the buyer is willing to buy. All these modules in European warehouses will have to be sold by the end of this year, which means that regardless of what was the purchase price in the market, people will try to sell at the current market price because they need to release cash to pay their bills. For many companies it will be a matter of survival,” he said. For this reason, these stocked modules, especially those relying on p-type technology, may now be offered at a lower price than new arrivals from China.
When the bottom will be reached is unclear and installers will not wait indefinitely.
“You can wait, wait and wait but some installation just need to be delivered by the end of the year,” Majewski said.
Skypo expressed doubt about the possibility of experiencing another substantial decrease in solar module prices for utility-scale projects. He said that delaying the implementation of these projects results in lost generation and revenue. He also noted that expenses related to constructing photovoltaic farms, such as transformer stations and support structures, have not decreased, and labor costs have increased. While predicting the future remains uncertain, he suggested that the overall cost of PV farms may gradually increase.
Majewski believes there will be a limit to further module price drops in the months to come.
If you look at the margins made by the polysilicon and wafer manufacturers, and at those made by module makers, you realize that panel producers have not benefitted that much from the upward trend of the last two years. It was mostly the polysilicon and wafer manufacturers that captured windfall profits,” he said. “Now, however, both polysilicon and wafer producers are largely operating close to their marginal cost. So, it means that there is not too much potential for the prices to go significantly down further. They may continue to slide slowly but not as quickly as we have seen in Q3 2023.”
Majewski said that while there may be exceptionally low prices for specific batches, there is already a range of prices from €0.12/W to €0.13/W. For those with flexibility in their module preferences, attractive deals can be found. However, those seeking specific sizes or brands are advised to secure their deliveries promptly.
Regarding the module inventory levels, Majewski said he anticipates a return to normal levels in Europe by the end of June 2024. He said that the first and second quarters of the year are the likely timeframe for Europe to regain its standard inventory levels. By the end of June, issues related to “old” stocks may no longer be a concern, but the possibility of distributors once again committing to excessive volumes in new contracts remains uncertain.

Germany installed 919 MW of new PV capacity in September, according to the latest figures from the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur). This compares to 1,056 MW in August and 750 MW in September 2022.
In the first nine months of this year, developers connected 10.72 GW of solar to the grid, compared to 5.6 GW in the same period a year earlier.
This means that the German government's goal of achieving a newly installed capacity of 9 GW for this year has already been exceeded. With a view to the goal of a cumulative installed capacity of 215 GW by 2030, the monthly increase – viewed linearly – would have to be 1,578 megawatts, as determined by the Federal Network Agency. This value has not been reached in any month so far this year.
The country's cumulative solar capacity surpassed 77.67 GW at the end of September.
In September, the combined capacity of rooftop systems supported with feed-in tariffs or market premiums totaled 666 MW. This is also the lowest value since February and a significant decrease compared to previous months when there were more than 800 MW in this segment – with the peak value of almost 937 MW having been reached in June.

Solar assets in the region saw 110-120% of average monthly irradiance through September.
A strong and slow-moving storm early in the month lessened irradiance in southern Brazil, but the rest of mid-latitude South America saw mostly normal irradiance, according to data collected by Solcast, a DNV company, via the Solcast API. The Altiplano Plateau saw the highest irradiance for the whole continent. This is in line with historical averages, as the area records some of the highest irradiance levels in the world.

In September the tropics saw higher irradiance than usual. This was due to clearer skies caused by the current drought in the Amazon. The northeastern part of the Amazon has been dry since mid-July, resulting in reduced moisture in the rainforest and less evapotranspiration. This is a major source of moisture fuelling cloud formation over rainforest regions.
The region saw regular cumuliform clouds typical of tropical regions, but not the large storms and rainfall events that are typical of the start of the wet season in September. The rivers in the Amazon are reported to be at their lowest level in over a century as there has been a lack of rainfall and ensuing dry conditions in recent months. This has been exacerbated by warm conditions, as South America recorded the warmest September extending from heatwaves.

The Brazilian southern states of Rio Grande de Sul and Santa Catarina saw reduced irradiance. It recorded 10-20% below September averages and is due to an unusually strong extra-tropical cyclone. The storm moved onshore from the Atlantic in early September, and it’s slow-moving nature meant the irradiance impacts were more focussed and intense. Most of the remainder of mid-latitude South America saw much more moderate irradiance at or slightly below the long-term average.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with a typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.

Enphase has announced the launch of its IQ EV charger for charging electric vehicles at home. The microinverter and home energy storage provider said that the chargers offer between 31 miles (49.8 km) and 61 miles of range charging per hour on its fast chargers.
The EV charger can be paired with Enphase solar and energy storage systems. It handles Wi-Fi connections and includes smart control and monitoring capabilities.
The devices can be coordinated to help solar and battery owners maximize electricity cost savings by charging directly from solar production. With a home battery, the Enphase system enables vehicle charging even when there is a grid power outage.
IQ EV chargers come in 32 A, 48 A, and 64 A configurations, which offer 7.7 kW, 9.6 kW, and 15.4 kW max power respectively.
Each charger has NEMA 6-50P, and 14-50P rated input cables, which are hardwired. It has a ruggedized J1772 connector for universal compatibility and a 25-foot charge cable. The device is rated for both indoor and outdoor use. They come with a five-year warranty from Enphase and is backed with a 24-7 customer support line from Enhpase.
“As a solar contractor that has installed Enphase microinverters for my customers since 2009, I’m glad to see the IQ EV Chargers join Enphase’s product ecosystem,” said Louis Woofenden, owner and engineering director, Net Zero Solar. “I was excited to try out this improved smart charger on the Enphase platform with ClipperCreek heritage. It’s so helpful to be able to easily schedule charge times, manually start and stop charging my EV, and monitor my EV energy use – all from the Enphase App on my phone.”
The 32 A device starts retail at $732 while the 64 A device retails at $1,176 on the Enphase site. Enphase is positioning its charger, microinverter and home battery as a “one-stop-shop” for home energy solutions.
“Installing an EV charger with a solar and battery system simply makes sense and can reduce overall installation costs,” said Jayant Somani, president and general manager, digital business for Enphase Energy.

The show comprised 350 exhibitors and more than 24,000 attendees over three days, which the organizers say amounts to 28% growth over last year. Simon Wang, President of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council, also noted that around 20% of attendees were at the event for the first time, denoting a growing importance for companies looking at net-zero strategies and ways to implement renewable energy.
Energy storage
Energy storage was front and center throughout the event, with companies from various background exhibiting batteries. Many of these are focused on commercial solutions for large, energy hungry industries to maximize their renewable energy uptake. And these often came with sophisticated energy management solutions –  illustrating Taiwan’s position as a leader in software development.
The show also saw plenty of talk about large-scale storage, and hopes that changes to legislation might soon drive bigger demand for residential energy storage as well. Battery suppliers were also keen to demonstrate their latest fire safety innovations, including cell level monitoring, automated water and chemical fire suppression systems and the somewhat simpler approach of encasing the whole battery system in concrete, which supplier TCC says would be able to contain fire at temperatures above one thousand degrees, and also bring other advantages in system longevity.
Taiwan will still be reliant on imports for its energy storage plans, with many players sourcing fully made batteries from abroad, or only assembling cells into packs locally. One company, Formosa Smart Energy, is looking to bring battery cell manufacturing to Taiwan. President Hui-Chi Liu told pv magazine that the company is working to bring 2.1 GWh of battery cell capacity online by the middle of 2024, with plans to later expand this to 5 GWh. At its booth in the exhibition, the company also had innovative approaches on show to battery recycling and solid-state batteries based on a mixed ceramic/polymer electrolyte.
Solar manufacturing
Taiwan’s solar manufacturing industry has seen little growth lately, faced with heavy competition from producers in mainland China. The cell and module makers at the show, however, shared a positive outlook, with expectation of more orders from domestic projects, as well as strong exports to the United States – where prices have remained high enough for Taiwan’s manufacturers to be competitive.
One manufacturer stated that it is also examining the opportunity of bringing manufacturing capacity online in the US, but sees some signs that the Inflation Reduction Act, which has brought with it a flood of factory announcements across the US, may have passed its peak. Their calculations show that the US could have 60 GW of module manufacturing capacity up and running by 2026, without much more than 40 GW of annual domestic demand to serve.
On the technology side, these manufacturers report that reliability, rather than the latest technology is the name of the game for now. All of the manufacturers pv magazine spoke with at the event are in the process of switching passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) manufacturing to the latest high efficiency tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology, by the middle of next year.

While 2023 is still trailing 2021 for small-scale solar installations, the difference is now only 150 MW, or 7%, according to data from Sunwiz. In 2021, the fourth quarter was the most tumultuous three-month period. On the other hand, elevated lead levels and a spike in Google searches suggests that the fourth quarter of this year will contend for the strongest period in 2023.
“I think there’s already a good deal of momentum backed in and that we are going to see elevated levels [of sales],” Warwick Johnston, managing director of Sunwiz, tells pv magazine Australia. “I suspect we are going to have a strong October, so we’re up for a record year.”
Lead volumes this September were up 78% compared to the number of quote requests in September 2021, Sunwiz has found. Many customers are npw turning to Google to find out about installing solar.
“I’m seeing consumer interest levels 10 to 20% up on what they were in the same time of previous year. All this hasn’t yet flowed through to leads proposals and sales,” Johnston said of the spike in Google trends for “solar” and “solar panel.” He said that it's “the highest level it's been … and paybacks [on solar systems] are all improving now, so that bodes well for 2024 as well. My prediction is that we are going to have a strong finish to the year and have a record year for 2023.”
The average size of solar systems in Australia is also at record high, with especially strong growth in 10 kW to 15 kW systems. “The reason is because you’ve got commercial doing really, really well. Record year for commercial.”
Another interesting trend is that while Australian solar system prices are now falling after the pandemic hike, this has not translated to customers spending less overall.
This is demonstrated in the above two graphs, with the total dollar customer spend on top and dollars per watt below.
“If you look at the dollar total spend, it’s pretty consistent and flat. So this to me is saying as panels are getting cheaper, people are putting more of them on,” Johnston said.

The university student residence installation is claimed to generate solar heat up to 120 C, with an annual peak capacity of 69.9 kW thermal energy. It is the first North American project for the British company.
The VirtuHOT HD collector uses a heat plate to absorb the sun’s energy and transfers it to the solar fluid to a high-efficiency heat plate. The absorber plate has a low emissivity coding reducing radiative heat loss. The vacuum in the glass tube reduces additional heat loss, resulting in a maximum of efficiency.
Naked Energy also makes PVT systems in a vacuum tube form with an absorber plate, conventional silicon solar cells, a borosilicate glass tube, and an integrated reflector in a mounting system with a 25.4 cm profile.
The absorbers can be tilted towards the sun optimising performance on pitched roofs, flat roofs, and vertical facades. A single tube unit measures 2,165 mm x 300 mm x 265 mm and weighs 20.9 kg. Its aperture area is 0.64 m2 and the absorber area is 0.331 m2. Its peak thermal output is 275 W and the electrical output is 70 W.
“The business development teams at ELM Solar and Naked Energy are currently in conversations with a variety of leads in the United States,” Christophe Williams, Naked Energy CEO, told pv magazine, noting that potential customers in the US range from paper and pulp manufacturers, health care facilities and restaurants, to pilot projects with international utility companies.
“Solar heat technology has enormous potential because it takes the task of heating water, a major energy cost in any building, either off the power or gas grid, resulting in financial and carbon savings for the building owner,” said Lee C. Graves, chairman, ELM Companies, owner of ELM Solar.
According to its CEO, Naked Energy is developing a software platform to ease the planning and modeling of new PVT installations, including cost, performance, and return on investment calculations for PV-generated electricity, solar heating and cooling. Williams also said that a first German project is slated to start construction in January, without providing further details.
Naked Energy claims that its technology quadruples the reduction of greenhouse gases per square meter compared to traditional solar PV panels.
The article was amended on October 20, 2023 to reflect that it was a thermal system and not a PVT system as originally reported.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/20/new-performance-measurement-kit-for-outdoor-testing-of-bifacial-perovskite-solar-modules/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",VALERIE THOMPSON,"OCTOBER 20, 2023","New performance measurement kit for outdoor testing of bifacial, perovskite solar modules  ","EKO Instruments has introduced the PV Blocks performance measurement system, developed by Dutch engineering specialist ReRa Solutions.
The measurement system is purportedly capable of testing off-grid and grid-connected solutions with support for standard tests as defined in IEC 60891 and IEC 60904-1.
“Users can define the number of PV modules to connect to a variety of solar and meteorological sensors,” Kees Hoogendijk, EKO Instruments CEO, told pv magazine, who noted that the PV Blocks system has an integrated “rugged” PC, equipped with software to support data acquisition and data storage, a web-based interface, and an application interface (API) for Python programming packages.
The company is responding to the need to test under real-world conditions new types of PV modules for applications, such as building integrated PV (BIPV), agrivoltaics, and floating solar, as well as bifacial modules and perovskite solar cells.
“All of these need on site testing and research in diverse geographical regions, under varying environmental and atmospheric conditions,” said Hoogendijk. “It is difficult to test performance of the cells and modules in the lab under static conditions without verification outdoors.”
PV Blocks supports up to 32 PV test modules. Measurement loads range from 450 W to 900 W for IV-current voltages, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and positive voltage biasing. The measurement of IV curves can be set from 200 ms up to 30 seconds. The system also features an optional IP55 weatherproof enclosure for outdoor deployment.
As the name suggests, individual modules or blocks can be added to the “base” system, which consists of a PC, a systems controller block, application software, a 24 VDC power supply unit, and a 10 m ethernet cable.
The optional measurement modules are equipped with cables, connectors, sensors, and optical components for the following tests: temperature, MPTT, power, voltage, irradiance, and IV curves. The optional Modbus unit has 4 channels to digitally connect external equipment, such as pyranometers, reference cells, or weather sensors.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/20/ferc-figures-shows-us-solar-capacity-could-surpass-natural-gas-by-2030/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 20, 2023",FERC figures shows US solar capacity could surpass natural gas by 2030,"From pv magazine USA
FERC's new energy infrastructure report shows that solar holds the largest share of capacity additions in the energy mix in the United States. 
In the January-August period, just under 9 GW of solar capacity was added, representing 40.5% of all capacity additions. This represents 36% growth year on year. 
Wind power provided an additional 2.7 GW, accounting for about 12.5% of new capacity additions. When including solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and biomass, renewable energy sources contributed 54.3% of capacity additions. 
Much growth lies ahead for decarbonized energy to push out fossil fuel sources. For total available installed generating capacity, natural gas remains the leader. More than 44% of available electricity generation capacity comes from natural gas, followed by coal, wind, hydropower, and solar.
FERC forecasts strong growth in solar for years to come. It expects more than 83 GW of “high probability” solar capacity additions through August 2026. This dwarfs the 4 GW of natural gas additions expected through that date. 
FERC said that the 83 GW of “high probability” solar additions may be quite conservative. There are more than 214 GW of solar additions in the three-year project pipeline. 
Natural gas has 564 GW available installed capacity today, while solar has 92 GW. Looking ahead three years, if solar were to add all the projects in the pipeline to the grid, it would reach 306 GW. The figures suggest that with a healthy ramp-up of projects, solar could feasibly push out natural gas as the No. 1 provider of electricity by 2030. 
Reaching status as the number one provider of electricity will take significant funding. A report from Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) showed that the United States’ total investment in clean energy, clean transportation, building electrification and carbon management reached $213 billion over the last year (from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023). 
The $213 billion invested represents a 37% leap over 2021-22 investments of $155 billion. Clean investment continues to strongly increase each year. In 2018/2019, total investments reached $81 billion, and it has climbed every year since.  
Domestic manufacturing of clean energy technologies has become an increased focus in recent years, and rich tax credits and incentives have served as an attracting force. Manufacturing investments totaled $39 billion in 2022/2023, more than doubling the $17 billion invested in the previous report period.  
Solar represented the largest energy and industry investment category in the second quarter of 2023, attracting $8.62 billion. This was followed by storage with $4.08 billion, and wind with $2.03 billion.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/20/china-polysilicon-prices-fall-for-first-time-in-more-than-three-months/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 20, 2023",China polysilicon prices fall for first time in more than three months,"China Mono Grade, the OPIS benchmark assessment for polysilicon prices in the country, fell 4.22% to CNY79.5 ($11.07)/kg week-on-week for the first time in more than three months on the back of weakening demand across the solar supply chain, which has finally impacted the upstream polysilicon sector.
Domestic polysilicon prices were assessed in the range of CNY75-83/kg. While major polysilicon makers hold their price quotes at the higher end of the range, tier-2 producers have cut prices to their lower end, pulling overall market prices down.

Weakening polysilicon demand – driven by lower solar installation rates in the fourth quarter of 2023 – contributes to the move downward, with trade volumes light in the week to Tuesday. Wafer makers have cut their operating rates as module inventories build and solar installations face delays in the fourth quarter. Expecting polysilicon prices to fall further, wafer makers adopting a wait-and-see approach when purchasing the material.
High inventories in both the polysilicon and wafer segments also weigh on prices. According to a solar market veteran, China’s wafer inventories are estimated at 20 GW and polysilicon inventories at around 50,000 MT.
China polysilicon prices are expected to bottom out in the fourth quarter as more polysilicon capacity comes online and building inventories contribute to a supply glut.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/20/key-takeaways-from-powerelec-kenya/,"EVENTS,MARKETS,KENYA",COSMAS MWIRIGI,"OCTOBER 20, 2023",Key takeaways from Powerelec Kenya,"The recent Renewable Energy Forum Africa (REFA) highlighted Africa's renewable energy potential. Organized by AFSIA and SolarPower Europe and supported by Get-Invest, the event took place in Kenya alongside Powerelec EXPO at the Sarit Center Expo in Nairobi from Oct. 4 to Oct. 6.
It featured more than 100 exhibitors, 300 delegates, and panel discussions on topics like C&I financing, market value, investment opportunities in Mozambique, and net metering. One session estimated Africa's renewable market to be worth approximately $350 billion, with investors seeking impact, reasonable returns, and manageable risk.
“We are improving the profitability of mini-grids through a number of different levers, such as driving synergies with SHS through a multi-technology approach,” Gillian-Alexandre Huart, CEO of ENGIE Energy Access.
According to Inocencia Gujamo, the coordinator of electrification in Mozambique the government of Mozambique wants to promote renewable energy.
“We aim to achieve 100% renewable access by 2030 and 64% electricity access next year. Currently, we have 51% electricity access in Mozambique,” said Gujamo.
Another topic was about projects and issues facing minigrids.
“Not all rural last-mile sites look the same. They look very different, with some sites doing fine with approximately 50% capex grant as the subsidy while others need a more significant subsidy and others doing fine with less than 50%,” said Julie Greene, managing director of Renewvia Solar Africa. “We have seen that there has only been one financing model that works for some sites and others. To reach last-mile customers, we need to look at the actual sites and see where to apply mini-grids and SHS because these are distributed communities.”
According to Sanjeev Debipersad, the director of Investments Portfolio AECF, there is plenty of funding available. “How do we transition away from the dependencies on grants?” he asked.
“We need to step back before approaching the villages and precede with other instruments that help de-risk the minigrid,” said Debipersad. “For example, SME’s stimulations.”
Sanjeev noted challenges faced by African minigrids, including the need for track records and feasibility studies to attract financiers. Some companies are using their portfolios to access financing, improving risk appetite and enabling guarantee providers to participate.
The discussion also covered net metering, with implementation observed in Mauritius (5 kW max), Morocco, Namibia (500 kW max), Senegal, South Africa (100 kW max), Tunisia, and Zimbabwe (100 kW max).
