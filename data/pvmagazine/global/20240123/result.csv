South Korea's Hyundai has acquired an unspecified minority stake in German PV module recycler Flaxres.
Flaxres did not reveal the name of the new investor in its press release. Its name, however, can be found in the commercial register. The value of the transaction is estimated in the “three-digit million range,” the company said, adding that this transaction could help it to become active in important non-European markets in the future.
Flaxres has developed a patented solar module recycling technology, based on short-term, high-temperature heating using flash lamps. The company claims that this “flash lamp annealing” process is more environmentally friendly, more cost-efficient and significantly faster than conventional processes, which are usually based on mechanical shredding or thermal recycling of the modules.
With this process, all composite materials of the solar modules can be separated from each other according to type and returned to the material cycle.
Flaxres' largest shareholder is Germany-based industrial holding Econnext Group.

The complex dance between economic growth and environmental sustainability requires a nuanced and vigilant approach. As the United States embarks on this journey, it is important to monitor and navigate this space with acumen to ensure that economic prosperity aligns harmoniously with environmental goals.

From a macroeconomic perspective, a closer examination of the IRA execution process reveals a critical nexus between policy incentives and the effective use of available spaces. This intersection is particularly important when it comes to open spaces throughout the country, both public and private. To unlock the full potential of such spaces, a strategic embrace of current and emerging technology is needed. Here, the emphasis extends beyond mere economic gains and focuses on the multifaceted benefits of these spaces that are consistent with broader sustainability goals.
Data from Portland-based nonprofit the Parking Reform Network introduces the compelling statistic that cities in the United States with a population of more than one million people allocate around 22% of their city center land for parking purposes. That figure presents a significant opportunity: the integration of solar canopies as an innovative solution to transform open parking spaces into multi-functionality hubs. Beyond the conventional purpose of parking spaces, these areas can be used as platforms for the generation of renewable energy, demonstrating the harmonious coexistence of urban infrastructure and sustainability.
The prospect of innovative solar canopies is a shining light in this landscape. It is a tangible and transformative means of using open parking spaces for various purposes. Under the guidance and coordination of the IRA, these spaces can be re-imagined as hubs for innovative solar canopy deployment. This vision transcends the mere shading of vehicles; it signifies a paradigm shift toward stacking functionality within the same spatial domain – a testament to the convergence of economic viability, environmental sustainability, and effective infrastructure development.
The importance of this transformative potential extends beyond the conceptual realm. Given the variety of technology currently available, the previously far-fetched idea of using open parking spaces for different functions has become an achievable reality. Astute resource allocation allows these spaces to be transformed into dynamic entities that provide shade for vehicles, support the deployment of micro-grids, facilitate demand-response initiatives, promote grid energy peak shaving and the creation of virtual power plants, and serve as charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs) – all coexisting within the same physical realm.
World4Solar believes this multifaceted approach necessitates a conceptual shift in how we conceive and implement synergies among technology, and how we design our solutions with this vision in mind. Traditionally manufactured and implemented separately, these diverse technological solutions now offer harmonious integration that converges within the same spatial dimensions. The profound impact of such integration goes beyond a singular focus on renewable energy generation; it embodies a holistic approach to comprehensive infrastructure development.
However, this transformative vision is not without challenges. Access to open parking lots faces various obstacles, including local permitting requirements and timetables, accessibility of compatible electrical grid interconnection points, and initial investment in the project costs required before any investment tax credits benefit investors. Overcoming these hurdles requires strategic foresight and commitment to consider the necessary investment in time and resources as a positive game for all stakeholders.
Municipalities and government leaders, especially those who lead sustainability planning departments and committees, play a central role in this transformative process. A proactive attitude, which includes the evaluation of current open spaces and direct investment in visible projects, can catalyze community engagement and encourage business leaders. The resulting ripple effect, spurred by intentional investment, has the potential to drive broader adoption and influence more favorable price points through economies of scale.
Essentially, the nation is at an unprecedented crossroads and has a unique opportunity to perform much-needed repairs to infrastructure. The use of policy and financial incentives, such as the 45X production tax credit and the investment tax credit, offers a way to create a modern, efficient, and functionally diverse amalgamation of multiple technologies. This approach, rooted in fair use, has the transformative potential to reshape urban landscapes and make them more sustainable, more economically vibrant, and more technologically advanced.
Innovative solar canopies are emerging as a key player in the range of transformative clean energy possibilities. The impetus to create and shape the various paths to such a reality lies directly with investors and policymakers. It requires a collective commitment to envision and implement a future in which economic growth, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation seamlessly converge for the benefit of all.

The scientists explained that their approach consisted of analyzing the absorber's electron affinity, interfacial defects, and parasitic resistance, as well as assessing the impact of these factors on cell performance. They also tested different types of buffer layers in the proposed cell configuration, in an effort to find non-toxic alternatives to cadmium sulfide (CdS).
The research group used the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, developed by the University of Ghent, to simulate the novel cell design. The latter includes a glass substrate coated with molybdenum (Mo), a molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) layer, the Ag2BaTiSe4 absorber, the buffer layer, and transparent conductive oxide films made of indium zinc oxide (IZO) and aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO), and a metal contact.
For the buffer layers, they considered using CdS as well as new alkaline earth metal chalcogenides such as magnesium sulfide (MgS), calcium sulfide (CaS), strontium sulfide (SrS), and barium sulfide (BaS). They took into account critical parameters such as thickness, carrier concentration, and defect density.
The team also introduced neutral defects at the Ag2BaTiSe4/MoSe2 and buffer/Ag2BaTiSe4 to create realistic operating conditions for the simulation and sought to assess how the buffer layers' carrier concentration influences the interface properties between the absorber and buffer in the cell. It also applied impedance spectroscopy to investigate the accumulation of charge carriers at the cell interface.
The researchers' analysis showed that the optimal value for MoSe2’s carrier concentration of 10 cm−3 and that of the thickness of the Ag2BaTiSe4 absorber should be between 0.5 µm and 1.6 µm. It also showed the solar cell may achieve a power conversion efficiency of 18.84% with a MgS layer, of 17.17% with a CaS layer, of 20.65% with a SrS layer, of 20.87% with a BaS layer, and of 18.66% with a conventional CdS layer.
Further analysis demonstrated that, by finetuning MoSe2 parameters and interfacial properties, the efficiencies may reach 28%, 30.02%, 29.87%, 30.23%, and 29.68%, respectively.
The scientists concluded by saying that interface defects have a “massive” impact on the performance of the proposed cell design. “These defects are generally produced due to the structural defects between different layers and metal cation diffusion through the absorber during fabrication,” they explained. Thus, effective techniques must be employed for the deposition of layers, and methods such as etching, post-heat treatment, and inserting a passivation layer can be used to minimize the interface defects.
Their findings can be found in the study “Highly efficient emerging Ag2BaTiSe4 solar cells using a new class of alkaline earth metal-based chalcogenide buffers alternative to CdS,” published in scientific reports. “This work could open constructive research avenues for the photovoltaic community to fabricate highly efficient thin-film solar cells using novel Ag2BaTiSe4 as an absorber and new alkaline earth metal chalcogenides as alternative, non-toxic buffers,” they stated.
The team also included academics from the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission.

Ausgrid has started the delivery of its first PV-powered microgrid, which has been designed to provide off-network power supplies to key business and community services in the town of Merriwa, New South Wales.
The low-voltage connected microgrid, which is being delivered in partnership with Queensland government-owned energy services business Yurika, will include small-scale power generation, a battery energy storage system, a backup diesel generator, and control technologies.
Ausgrid said the microgrid, to be located at its depot in Merriwa about 270 kilometers northwest of Sydney, will be able to operate during planned and unplanned power interruptions, switching on to maintain supply automatically to homes and businesses in the trial area.
Ausgrid’s group executive of customer, assets and digital, Junayd Hollis, said the Merriwa microgrid is the first of its kind on the company’s network and will help inform how Ausgrid can best deliver a more responsive, resilient and reliable power supply.
“This is a key innovation trial to demonstrate how Ausgrid can best support communities to be increasingly resilient in the face of extreme weather and extended outages, no matter where they live on our network,” he said.
Ausgrid, which is the largest electricity distributor on Australia’s east coast with more than 1.7 million customers, said its climate impact research for the Upper Hunter region shows that by 2050 the region will be subject to an increase in all types of climate risks such as heat, storms and bushfire.
The seasonal, December and January edition of pv magazine reveals the much-anticipated winners of this year’s pv magazine Awards. We also consider the ramifications of the current global oversupply of solar panels, Australia’s prospects of refining battery raw materials, and examine how the European Union’s green hydrogen ambitions are developing.
The network operator said a microgrid allows it to provide a more resilient electricity supply to customers and it is confident the technology is now at a stage that it will work reliably and cost effectively.
Hollis said the early work has commenced on the Merriwa project to ensure all 28 properties within the microgrid’s catchment area have the infrastructure required to support the connection.
The microgrid is expected to undergo commissioning in the first half of 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/23/hybrid-optimization-mppt-tech-for-pv-systems-under-partial-shading/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 23, 2024",Hybrid optimization MPPT tech for PV systems under partial shading,"Researchers at the Vellore Institute of Technology in India have conceived a new hybrid maximum power point tracker (MPPT) method to improve energy yield in PV systems operating under partial shading conditions.
The proposed technique utilizes an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), which is a special type of artificial neural network using the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy inference system. The ANFIS is mainly intended to limit the disadvantages of fuzzy and neural network controllers, and in PV systems its goal is to reduce faults.
“The rules of ANFIS approximate the PV function from a nonlinear way to a linear way,” the scientists said. “Also, this network is used in energy management systems for the smooth operation of PV-fed batteries.”
The new method is also based on the use of controllers relying on the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm, which mimics the social behavior of grey wolves in hunting.
“In this algorithm, there are four major parameters which are alpha, beta, delta, plus omega,” the research team noted. “The alpha (α) variable is illustrated as an optimal solution from the different possible solutions or leader wolf. Similarly, the beta (β), and delta (δ) constants are selected as the second, and third-best optimal solutions from the search space. The normal wolf solution is given by omega (ω).”
The proposed configuration, according to its creators, provides for optimized wolves' exploration convergence ratio, while balancing their population and search for space. It also ensures that PV voltage is supplied to the power DC-DC converter for enhancing the PV source voltage to meet future microgrid voltages.
The scientists tested the performance of the MPPT technique and the associated solar system-fed converter circuit in a series of simulations conducted on a 3-diode model PV array via the Matlab-Simulink software. A source-side capacitor filtered the PV power ripples and protected the switches at rapid variations of supply voltages. A supply inductor charged the supply voltage of PV under the MOSFET forward bias condition and smoothened the supply voltage.
“The MOSFET is used because its properties are less gate-to-source voltage required for going to conduct, operates high efficiency at low rated voltages, consists of high source resistance to limit the gate current, quick working response, plus less possibility of damage,” the academics explained.
The simulation considered parameters such as oscillations across MPP, output power extraction, settling time of the MPP, dependency on the PV modeling, operating duty value of the converter, error finding accuracy of MPPT, algorithm complexity, tracking speed, periodic tuning required, and the number of sensing parameters utilized.
The research group claimed the new hybrid MPPT technique can provide “good results” when compared with other MPPT methods, with the PV source voltage rising from one level to another level. “The merits of the utilized converter are easy understanding, high reliability, plus lower price to implement,” it added.
The findings were introduced in the paper “A novel on design and implementation of hybrid MPPT controllers for solar PV systems under various partial shading conditions,” published in scientific reports.

Soly, which is already active in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, South Africa, and the U.K., has just launched in Italy, the first of the four planned market entries. It will be based in Milan, Lombardy, in the northern part of the country.
Soly's €30 million financing round attracted new investors such as  ArcTern Ventures and Fifth Wall, which are North American venture capital firms. They were joined by early investors Shell Ventures, the corporate venture arm of energy giant Shell, along with Dutch pension fund ABP.
Soly develops a platform to sell and lease to the residential and small business market a range of energy products, such as solar panels, inverters, electric vehicle chargers, and battery storage systems. It also provides an energy contract with variable tariffs and dynamic energy features.
In addition, the Dutch company offers a product it calls Soly Brain, a home energy management system with a consumer app.
“Based on our dynamic energy contract, it intelligently controls solar panels, home batteries and charging stations, among other things, to create an additional revenue model for the end-user,” Soly founder Milan van der Meulen told pv magazine, noting that the Soly Brain unit can control usage based on time-of-use tariffs to generate savings.
There is also a plan to develop virtual power plants for Dutch and German customers enabled by the Solar Brain product. “Eventually, we’ll bundle our users into a virtual power plant to actively balance the energy grid and offer new services. In 2024, we’ll install the first energy networks in the Netherlands and Germany,” said van der Meulen.
Soly’s products and services are sold via a self-service configurator and app that enables customers to generate quotes and set up appointments for installation. Soly also offers its solution as a white-label service to partners, such as insurance companies and banks, according to van der Meulen.
Gronigen-based Soly, formerly known as Enie, was founded in 2013 and employs 160 people. Its international growth has been achieved organically, without mergers or acquisitions, according to van der Meulen.
