Academics from Finland's Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology (LUT) and the Austral University of Chile, have published a study which estimates the solar industry will support 60 million direct jobs by 2050, up from around 7 million last year.
The Job creation during a climate compliant global energy transition across the power, heat, transport, and desalination sectors by 2050 paper, published in this month's Energy and on the ScienceDirect website, estimates solar will account for 45% of the net jobs generated worldwide as fossil fuels and nuclear are phased out in favor of renewables. Of those PV positions, the study states, 44 million will be in the large scale electricity generation segment and 16 million supported by prosumer arrays.
pv magazine’s  UP Initiative spent the last quarter looking at what solar and energy storage companies can do to lead by a positive example when it comes to the workers, often far removed, involved in the production of their products and services. Supply chain traceability and polysilicon provenance were the key topics considered.
The solar job numbers compare to an estimated 5% of the total to be contributed by wind power, with the authors of the study predicting 8 million wind jobs up to 2025 before the number falls back to 5-6 million out to mid century. The change will come when photovoltaic technology becomes more cost-effective than wind turbines some time around the middle of the decade, according to the paper.
The study's authors say their figures are more accurate than previous attempts to quantify the employment benefits of the switch to renewables because they include the direct job-creation benefits of the heating, transport and desalination sectors as well as the number of roles to be generated in electricity transmission and distribution. The figures also include the jobs to be generated by fossil fuel and nuclear generation, principally in the field of decommissioning such facilities.
The authors note, however, that while their estimates include heat and energy storage and power-to-X technologies such as green hydrogen production, the numbers do not include jobs which could be generated by privately-owned electric vehicles (EVs).
Delving into the numbers, the LUT paper estimates power generation will support 69 million jobs in mid century, up from 20 million last year, with heating to supply 28 million posts by that point, electricity grids around 22 million, storage technologies around 10 million and fuels 5 million. Operations and maintenance jobs will account for around 42 million jobs in 2050, stated the paper, alongside more than 40 million construction and installation roles, and more than 23 million manufacturing positions, up from 6 million last year.
The key factor in the anticipated employment bounty is an estimate the 563 final-energy-demand-specific jobs supported by each TWh of power generated last year will rise to 1,000 roles in mid-century, reflecting the oft-repeated estimate renewables are more labor-intensive than fossil fuel and nuclear facilities.
The study's authors claim to have included estimates of the effect of automation in their calculations by reducing labor-intensity as the capital and operational expenses of renewables decrease, with the paper stating: “Job creation can be expected to reduce as technologies, and production of those technologies, mature.” The likelihood post-energy-transition roles will be, on average, better qualified than those held in energy last year was posited as a good thing, with the authors of the paper claiming greater training demand can be met by good policies.
Inevitably, the LUT study suggests the jobs dividend will not be universally even across the nine regions into which the report divides the globe. For instance, Eurasia; the Middle East and North Africa (MENA); South America; and sub-Saharan Africa can all expect to have fewer direct, energy-related manufacturing jobs in 2050 than they had last year, with the academics indicating the latter would suffer the steepest fall without offering a figure in the abstract to the full paper.
By contrast, northeast Asia can expect to have 600,000 more such positions by mid-century, with South Asia experiencing a 400,000-job uplift, Europe gaining 270,000 positions, and South East Asia and North America advancing by 210,000 and 73,000 posts, respectively.
The fossil fuel-dependent nature of regions such as MENA, Eurasia and South Asia means such areas will account for a smaller share of the world's energy jobs in three decades' time, according to the study, although the authors were at pains to point out the absolute job numbers are expected to balloon because of that labor-intensity gain.
Europe, which last year accounted for 7% of the jobs across the sectors considered by the paper, will be a big winner, with its slice of the pie rising to an estimated 12% in 2050. North America will maintain its 10% share, according to the LUT document, with south and northeast Asia combined slipping just a little, from “over 50%” of such energy roles last year to “just below 50%” in 2050. Those plateaus amount to the 5 million roles in North America last year rising to 12 million and the volume of jobs doubling in the two Asian regions mentioned.
MENA; Southeast Asia and the Pacific; and South America will all see their proportions of total direct energy jobs fall 2% even as absolute job numbers leap, and Eurasia will see its 8% share last year retreat to 7% in 2050. No global share was offered for sub-Saharan Africa in the abstract of the paper but the authors noted that region would see the biggest benefit in absolute numbers from the energy transition, with last year's 2 million energy-dependent workers in the region becoming a 12 million-strong workforce in mid-century.

The new measure – schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act [ERA] – was published in the country's official journal on Friday.
“The amendment follows President [Cyril] Ramaphosa’s announcement on June 10, 2021, that the schedule 2 amendment of the ERA would be published within 60 days,” the government said in a statement. “The amendment serves to increase the threshold for embedded generation from the current 1 MW, to 100 MW, without the need for a license.”
Project developers will be exempted from applying for a license but they will be required to register with the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA).
The government said the new provisions are aimed at unlocking significant investment in new generation capacity in the short to medium term and helping the country reduce the impact of load shedding.
It will likely finally help the country build large scale unsubsidized wind and solar plants outside the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP), which provided strong growth in the last decade but has failed to provide significant volumes into the current one.
South Africa is seeking to reduce dependence on its state-owned utility, Eskom, for power supply. The troubled utility, which is currently unable to meet the country's power demand due to financial and operational issues, recently began considering renewables for its plant portfolio.

According to a recent report by Brazilian consultancy Greener, the country imported 4.88 GW worth of PV modules in the first half of 2021. This compares to just 2.2 GW in the first six months of last year, and surpasses the 4.76 GW of PV module imports registered for the whole of 2020.
The total imports for the first half of 2021 should mobilize investments of R$20 billion (US$3.81 billion) in Brazil, Greener CEO Marcio Takata told pv magazine.
The massive import of PV modules and inverters, however, does not reflect the volume of installed capacity. In the first half of 2021, 1,450 MW of distributed generation PV systems and just 63 MW of large-scale PV plants were installed in the country. For comparison, in 2020, these values stood at 2,644 MW and 793 MW, respectively.
“We started to feel this recovery at the end of last year when there was an acceleration of projects for distributed generation,” Takata continued. “This was one of the factors that triggered the acceleration and pushed companies to rebuild stocks.”
Most of the modules used in the new PV systems in Brazil continue to be imported. The participation of national manufacturers fell in the first half of 2021, representing just 1.8% of the market, compared to 3.8% in H1 2020 and 3% in H1 2019.
Overall, Longi was the largest importer with 825 MW in the first half of 2021. Trina, Canadian Solar, and Risen, meanwhile, all had volumes above 500 MWp. The market is still fragmented, with the top 10 brands corresponding to 82% of the market, among 52 active brands.
 
In the first half of 2021, PV inverters of more than 50 kW accounted for over 50% of the total imported volume of string inverters. The report does not consider central inverters. In this power range, Sungrow dominates, with 853 MW exported to Brazil in the period. There are currently 33 brands of inverters operating in this market.
PV inverters with lower power (less than 10 kW) corresponded to 29% of the volume imported in the first half of the year. Among the 64 brands that operate in this niche, Growatt was the leading provider with 247 MW. 
Inverters with a capacity between 10 kW and 49.9 kW represented 20.5% of the total imported volume. In this power range, the leader in the first half was Brazilian specialist WEG, with 183 MW supplied among 43 brands.
6 GW of distributed generation
In June 2021, distributed generation of solar energy in Brazil, which includes all PV systems not exceeding 5 MW in size, surpassed the 6 GW mark of installed power, reaching 6,142 MW. In the first half, 1,450 MW were added, which compares to 1,296 MW in the same period of 2020.
Brazil crossed the 9 GW mark for cumulative operational PV capacity in June.

Newly installed PV capacity in Taiwan was just 420 MW in the first six months of 2021, the company said, citing statistics from the country's Bureau of Energy; however, stronger development is expected for the second half of this year, with 2 GW of PV anticipated. “Orders have significantly exceeded the existing production capacity,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
Through the new production line, which will have an initial capacity of 400 MW and is scheduled to be operational in the fourth quarter of the year, the company will manufacture solar modules comprising M6 and M10 wafer formats.
URE Corp currently has a solar module capacity of 1.1 GW and a solar cell capacity of 2.5 GW. As for the modules, it has 600 MW of production capacity based in Taiwan and 500 MW in Vietnam. “We also outsource about another 200 MW of module [production capacity] from our supplier in Taiwan,” the company told pv magazine in February.
URE Corp, which was formerly known as Neo Solar Power, became Taiwan's largest PV manufacturer via a merger with Gintech, and Solartech. The company is also active in the PV project development business.

The 20 MW line will be used in a new solar module factory located in the West Bank of Palestine. “This initial capacity is expected to be expandable at a later stage to meet local and subsequently regional demand, a spokesperson for Massader said in a statement to pv magazine. “The project is envisioned to be commissioned in the year of 2022 and is part of a holistic national strategy geared towards sustainable energy transition in Palestine.”
Interested PV production equipment providers will have time until September 15, 2021, to submit their bids. Further technical details on the production line were not disclosed.
The Massader is currently a 35 MW school rooftop PV program, which launched in January 2018. “The program has been rolled out in batches of 40 schools with each batch being procured separately on a turnkey basis,” Massader director Mohammed Awartani told pv magazine in March.
Palestine had just 55 MW of solar capacity at the end of 2020, according to International Renewable Energy Agency figures. In 2020, newly deployed PV capacity was 5 MW.

The Invesco Solar ETF, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the MAC Global Solar Energy Index, underperformed broader markets in July. The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) decreased 3.0%, while the S&P 500 increased by 1.1% and the DJIA increased by 0.5%. The top five performing solar stocks in the U.S. market were: JinkoSolar Holding Co. (16.9%), Generac Holdings, Inc. (7.5%), Atlantic Sustainable Infrastructure Capital Inc. (3.2%), Daqo New Energy Corp. (2.5%), and Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital (1.7%).
The outlook for the U.S. residential market remains strong. According to one industry executive, a key driver behind his expectations for 25-50% growth in 2021 and 40-50% growth in 2022 is the rise of advanced origination platforms. These platforms allow bidding on installations and could make it easier for customers to connect with contractors.
The U.S. utility industry is expected to continue to struggle due to rising input costs. The focus has been placed on 2022 volumes, with companies continuing to delay new contracts while waiting for costs to decline. Shipping costs remain an issue, currently at three to six times the typical price/container of $2,000 to $4,000. The outlook for container prices is unclear, as is the amount of 2022 volume that could get pushed out due to inflated prices.
It is only a matter of time before a law is put in place banning imports of all products produced in China’s Xinjiang region. And companies are scrambling to figure out the best course of action.
A bill that cuts this region of China out of the solar supply chain will undoubtedly cause supply shortages, price increases, and strain for manufacturers. The Biden administration has shown support and is expected to provide enforcement regarding a bill banning products from Xinjiang. However, there has been a delayed response from the government, which is most likely purposeful to give the industry time to make supply chain adjustments.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/16/pv-powered-geothermal-heat-pump-system-for-greenhouses/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 16, 2021",PV-powered geothermal heat pump system for greenhouses,"Researchers at the University of Nottingham have investigated the performance of a shallow geothermal heat pump coupled to a PV system for the heating and cooling of a greenhouse.
Described in the paper Experimental investigation of a ground-source heat pump system for greenhouse heating–cooling, published in the International Journal of Low Carbon Technologies, the proposed system comprises a PV system, a 200 l water tank, a 5 kW commercial heat pump, a seasonal soil-based thermal energy storage system (SSBTESS), and a fan coil unit (FCU).
According to the scientists, the SSBTESS unit, which has 24 single vertical type heat exchangers (VHXs) and is placed at a depth of 0.2 m, is the critical component of the entire system. The heat pump serves as a buffer between the collection loop, the SSBTESS itself, and the fan coil subsystem. Thick insulations were also deployed to reduce soil heat loss and the radiant floor was covered by concrete, which acts as an underground heat extractor or injector unit in the greenhouse.
During high-temperature periods, the system absorbs heat from the greenhouse and brings it to the ground through the VHXs, while in low-temperature periods, the heat is taken from the pump’s buffer tank through circulation pipes to the fan coil unit.
This configuration was tested in a greenhouse with an area of 46.94 m2 and a volume of 142.87 m3 located in Loughborough, Leicestershire, England.  “The building gross wall area was 98.22 m2, with the roof area being 77.01 m2,” the scientists said. “It was covered with double glazing semi-transparent PV rooftop and opaque PV on all sidewalls.”
The rooftop PV system has an installed power of 7.67 kW and was installed with conventional solar modules supplied by Chinese-Canadian manufacturer Canadian Solar. The opaque PV system deployed on the sidewalls has a power of 2.8 kW and was built with 20%-efficient transparent PV modules with a power output of 90 W each provided by Taiwan-based manufacturer Polysolar Ltd. The inverters were provided by Austrian specialist Fronius.
The entire system, which relies on both active and passive techniques for the cooling of the greenhouse, was tested for a year. The measurements taken by the U.K. group showed that it was able to maintain an indoor temperature of over 16 Celsius degrees in all seasons, except for winter. “The problem can be solved by lowering the air infiltration and changing the cooling procedure,” said the researchers. “Furthermore, with this procedure, heat injection can be increased significantly.”
According to them, the system has almost reached the initial target they had established for the experimental setting. Average ambient temperatures ranged from 6.12 to 11.14 Celsius degrees and the ground surface temperatures inside the greenhouse ranged between 7 and 25 Celsius degrees.
Looking forward, the researchers said they want to improve the system thermal conductivity by injecting carbon- or metal-based nano-particles, water moisture, and encapsulated PCM solutions for trenches into the soil, and utilize a higher thermal capacity of the heat pump.

The SAR 3.4 billion (US$907 million) project is owned by ACWA Power and Saudi electricity holding company Badeel, which have each a 35% stake in the special purpose vehicle. Sapco, a unit of the country's energy giant Aramco owns the remaining 30%.
“A 25-year power purchase agreement for the plant was signed with the Saudi Power Procurement Company, with the tariff being among the lowest for solar PV projects globally,” ACWA Power said in a statement released. “The financing for the project is based on the principles of limited recourse project financing, with the senior debt structured as a soft mini perm facility with a tenor of 28 years and both conventional as well as Islamic tranches.”
The lenders are Mizuho Bank, Ltd, Riyad Bank, Korea Development Bank, Arab Petroleum Investments Corporation (Apicorp), Al Rajhi Banking & Investment Corporation, and Standard Chartered Bank.
ACWA Power said the solar plant, which will sell power at a price of $0.01239/kWh, will be the first built under the renewable energy program run by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which owns a 50% interest in the energy company itself. When completed it will be one of the largest single-contracted solar PV plants in the world.
