https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/28/new-solar-window-prototype-based-on-kesterite-photovoltaic-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 28, 2023",New solar window prototype based on kesterite photovoltaic cells,"Researchers led by Henan University in China have utilized kesterite (CZTSSe) thin-film solar cells in a new prototype of a smart solar window.
“Our prototype combines nickel-cobalt bimetal oxide (NiCoO2) electrochromic window and CZTSSe thin-film solar cells,” the research's lead author, Guofa Cai, told pv magazine. “Such an integrated prototype not only realizes the function integration of self-power and intelligent solar radiation adjustment, but also extends its function to energy storage.“
The scientists built the solar cell with a glass substrate coated with molybdenum (Mo), the kesterite absorber, a buffer layer based on cadmium sulfide (CdS), a layer of zinc oxide (ZnO), an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer deposited by magnetron sputtering, and silver (Ag) metal contacts.
They utilized a simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) strategy to prepare the NiCoO2 electrochromic films for the window. “Owing to the porous nanoflake array structure and the synergistic effect of nickel and cobalt elements, the NiCoO2 film and NiCoO2-based electrochromic smart windows exhibit excellent electrochemical, electrochromic as well as energy storage performance,” Cai explained.
The window also integrates a titanium oxide (TiO2) counter electrode film with a reportedly excellent performance of electrochromism and energy storage. This nanoparticle film acts as an ion storage layer owing to its good charge balance ability and high transmittance.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the solar window showed an energy consumption of 318.3 mWh/m2 and an overall efficiency of 2.15%, which the team said are values comparable with most of the solar windows developed to date.
“In particular, benefiting from the porous nanoflake arrays structure and the bimetallic synergistic effect, the NiCoO2 electrochromic films exhibit a large optical modulation, fast switching speed, outstanding electrochromic stability, as well as excellent rate capability,” they explained.
“The solar irradiation management performance of self-powered smart windows with neutral color tinting was studied for the first time, which is beneficial to improving the comfort of the occupants and makes it great potential in architectural applications,” Cai stated.
The cell technology and the window design were presented in the paper “Multi-functional electrochromic energy storage smart window powered by CZTSSe solar cell for intelligent managing solar radiation of building,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
Kesterite is one of the most promising light absorber material candidates for potential use in lower-cost thin-film solar cells. Kesterites are comprised of common elements, such as copper, tin, zinc, and selenium. And unlike GIGS compounds, there are no supply bottlenecks expected in the future. However, kesterite is still less efficient than CIGS in mass production. The world record efficiency for such cells is 12.6%, achieved by Japanese thin-film producer Solar Frontier in 2013.
Smart windows and photovoltachromic devices (PVCDs) are capable of enabling adjustable transparency glazing and, at the same time, generate electricity by means of the PV effect. This technology has so far been applied to the design of self-powered smart windows for buildings and vehicles at research level; however, it is still at a very early stage of development. The ability to modulate indoor light and heat transmission, while generating energy from PVs, is enticing for further BIPV developments.

By 2030, imports will cover 50% to 70% of the country's expected hydrogen demand of 95 TWh to 130 TWh. Hydrogen applications will be established in all sectors, and a hydrogen start-up network with over 1,800 kilometers of converted and new hydrogen lines is expected by 2027-28. The German Renewable Energy Federation (BEE) said it wants a stronger focus on domestic potential for green hydrogen production, as the government's strategy mainly targets imports, including blue hydrogen, which has higher emissions and costs.
BloombergNEF has reported that the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH2) has increased slightly this year due to inflation and higher financing costs. However, it says that green hydrogen (H2) will become competitive with existing gray H2 plants operating at marginal cost in five markets by 2030. The analysts say that green hydrogen will be cheaper than new blue H2 by 2028 using Chinese alkaline electrolyzers and by 2033 using Western alkaline electrolyzers, undercutting blue H2 by one to three years earlier in all modeled markets.
Inner Mongolia University researchers have reported that the Klebsiella pneumoniae Y7-3 strain, isolated from sheep rumen, can directly produce high-yield hydrogen using inexpensive straw as a raw material. The strain increased hydrogen production by 15.03% compared to the control group using corn stalk and yeast powder. The researchers published their findings in Energy, stating that anaerobic fermentation with 50 g L−1 of corn straw as the carbon source could produce 1253.72 ± 55.67 mL/L of hydrogen in 24 hours. The addition of regulatory factors such as FeSO4 (30 mg/L), NiCl2 (70 mg/L), or formic acid (5 g L−1) further improved hydrogen production by 25.72%, 17.89%, or 331.07%, respectively.
GreenH Electrolysis, a joint venture between Spain's H2B2 Electrolysis Technologies and India's GR Group, has started building its first 1 GW proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer factory in India. The plant will start production by October and will have an initial production capacity of 100 MW.
Levidian and United Utilities have teamed up to use sewage biogas in Manchester, England, to produce graphene and hydrogen. “The government-funded collaboration is a first for the UK water industry and will see Levidian's innovative LOOP technology used to decarbonize biogas created within the wastewater treatment process,” said Levidian. The agreement follows a successful feasibility study. It will serve as the first demonstration of a LOOP100 system. The project has been awarded GBP 3 million (€3,49 million) of funding from the UK Department of Energy Security and Net Zero Hydrogen BECCS Innovation Programme.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/28/assessing-the-future-pv-potential-of-the-worlds-sunniest-region/,"MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHILE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 28, 2023",Assessing the future PV potential of the world’s sunniest region,"A group of scientists from the Universidade de Vigo in Spain have sought to predict possible future variations in the solar photovoltaic power resource in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, the world's region with the highest solar radiation levels, during the period 2021–2060.
In the study “Photovoltaic power resource at the Atacama Desert under climate change,” published in Renewable Energy, the researchers explained that the Atacama Desert, which is also called “the solar Eldorado,” is one of the driest places in the world and one of the few where annual irradiance exceeds 2,500 kWh/m2.
Not by accident, the region has become Chile's and Latin America's largest solar energy hub, with dozens of large scale utility solar plants having come online there during the past decade, the latest of which – a 180 MW PV facility linked to 112 MWh of storage – was announced this week by US energy company AES Corporation. “Atacama has exceptional conditions for producing solar power, and effectively, the solar power installed capacity in this region represents 92.9% of the total installed capacity in Chile,” the Spanish group said.
Its work seeks to assess, for the first time, if this huge potential for PV deployment may be negatively affected by the effects of climate change. The group's analysis considered, in particular, how changes in surface air temperature (TAS) and surface wind velocity (sfcWind) may combine with modifications in the surface-downwelling shortwave radiation (RSDS). The latter is an important component of the Earth's surface radiation balance.
The academics used a set of regional climate models (RCMs) to analyze which factors drive changes in PV power generation under two pathway emissions scenarios, which they called RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. “Factors such as the impact of aerosols and dust that could deposit on solar panels are not evaluated, as they are not resolved by climate change models, are beyond the scope of this work,” they specified.
They compared the simulated RSDS, TAS, and sfcWinds data for the period 2021–2060 with those obtained for the period 1980–2015 and found these data are in “good agreement,” although the models were found not to be able to represent the values of scfWind correctly.
“The projected changes in TAS show an increase for the two periods and two scenarios and cause a decrease in the projected photovoltaic solar power resource per square meter,” they also stated. “We obtain an average reduction of 1.23% in photovoltaic solar power resource per square meter under the RCP2.6 for the near future and 0.52% for the mid-term. Under the RCP8.5, the reduction is even higher, with values of 1.53% for the near future and 0.77% for the mid-term.”
The Spanish team stressed that, although climate change has the potential to impact solar power generation in the Atacama region, the desert will still retain exceptional conditions for solar power production.

Germany's RCT Solutions has signed an agreement with the government of the Canadian province of Manitoba for the supply of production equipment to be used in a solar module manufacturing facility under development by undisclosed investors.
“This plant would be the first of its kind in the world with a fully integrated manufacturing process when it is completed,” said Manitoba Trade Minister Jeff Wharton. “Our government has worked tirelessly to create a business environment in which a global company like RCT Solutions can thrive and grow, and we’re pleased to begin the process of welcoming them to our province.”
The investors plan to invest around CAD 3 billion in the new fully integrated solar panel manufacturing plant, which may reach a capacity of up to 10 GW.
“Supplying a significant portion of North America with solar panels is an incredible opportunity for Manitoba,” said Wharton. “This new plant will have one of the lowest carbon footprints in the world, and the solar panels manufactured and exported will significantly increase Manitoba’s gross domestic product (GDP) and the province’s bottom line.”
The provincial government said the project will benefit from various federal and provincial economic stimulus programs for research and development, training incentives, manufacturing and green energy equipment investments, and construction costs.
“Manitoba’s reliable and renewable hydroelectricity, highly specialized workforce, and geographic location at the centre of North America all make the province well-positioned for exciting new manufacturing opportunities, particularly in the critical minerals sector,” said Wharton.

“The newly adopted legislation will make it possible to greenlight agrivotaics even faster than regular PV installations,” Maja Pokrovac, the director of the Association Renewable Energy Sources of Croatia (RES Croatia), told pv magazine.
Pokrovac said there has been a lot of interest from investors, but also strong pushback. Therefore, RES Croatia is organizing numerous workshops, roundtables, and consultations in a bid to inform the public about the benefits of agrivoltaics.
“There has been a change of heart among the farmers as they learn more about the potential of agrivoltaics for optimizing yield and reducing electricity bills,” says Pokrovac. “Our association will share further extensive data on the potential of agrivoltaics in Croatia in our new study which will be launched in September. The study was carried out by Croatia’s leading experts and financed by the EBRD.”
According to the new rules, agrivoltaics can be installed on sites defined as agricultural land, disused plots, and locations that host permanent plantations, including vineyards, and olive groves. The new legislation allows for every farmer to install agrivolatics on their own land.
“Our analysis finds that the country’s agrivoltaics potential is quite evenly distributed. In Slavonia, for example, there is a lot of potential for this type of installation as well as grid availability,” Pokrovac said.
According to the association’s data, Croatia has the potential to develop 3 GW of agrivoltaic projects.
“We are receiving updates from the Ministry of Agriculture that the interest in agrivoltaics is growing strong,” Pokrovac said. “Already this year, big developments are expected and projects in the double-digit MW sizes are expected. This will be a significant addition for the country’s solar fleet.”
Few utility-scale projects are being developed in Croatia at present, including the biggest installations of 3 MW and 10 MW, which are likely to become the country’s first power purchase agreement-backed solar arrays.
Hydropower represents around half of Croatia's electricity production, while wind accounts for around 14%. At the end of last year, solar accounted for a 0.5% share of Croatia’s energy mix, or around 224 MW. However, at the end of June, it already reached 2%, or 306 MW, according to Croatian distribution system operator HEP ODS.

Such a design is proposed to minimize losses caused by charge extraction from the solar cell, wiring, and voltage or current mismatch.
Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Germany have explored the optical design characteristics of a solar battery based on earth-abundant and cheap 2D polymeric carbon nitride as the photoanode.
To do this, the team first had to find a way to deposit a thin layer of 2D carbon nitride potassium, poly(heptazine imide), K-PHI, which normally comes in a powder form or in aqueous suspensions of nanoparticles. Then, they carried out optic simulations and experiments to take a closer look at the efficiency limitations and design considerations of their solar battery.
Being semi-transparent, the solar battery can absorb light on both sides. Specifically, it sandwiches a series of layers of semi-transparent materials with different functionalities between two high-transparency, conductive glass layers.
By calculating the absorptance within the solar battery comprising different K-PHI active layer thicknesses and the corresponding polystyrene sulfonate hole storage material layer, the researchers found that illumination through the rear of the device is superior irrespective of active layer thickness, as long as the collection layer is thinner than the active layer.
They also found that thinner active layers lead to larger photocharging currents (better solar cell functionality), but with a lower electric capacity (worse battery functionality).
The research team also reported that their device displays great versatility. It enables both large, one-off currents and smaller currents, which could be sustained over a longer time, typical of the requirements of mobile phones.
“We show how energy output increases most significantly for small electric discharging currents which are in the range of the photocharging current generated via illumination. This leads us to conclude that only minor light intensity increases can lead to major performance boosts,” the researchers write in Bridging the gap between solar cells and batteries: Optical design of bifunctional solar batteries based on 2D carbon nitrides published in Advanced Energy Materials.
They added that the results presented in the paper are transferable to other solar battery concepts, such as photocapacitors or solar redox flow batteries, which both utilize bifunctional electrodes or have separated light absorption and charge storage material heterojunctions.

In North America, high pressure led to unprecedented minimum overnight temperatures and clear sky days in the South and West. Consequently, temperatures and irradiance outperformed the long-term July average. However, in contrast, Canada and the Eastern US experienced reduced irradiance due to low pressure and unsettled rain, resulting in a three-month rainfall total in just 24 hours in parts of Nova Scotia.

Unprecedented heatwaves swept across western North America this month, with daily lows reaching record-breaking highs. Phoenix, Arizona, saw an all-time high daily minimum temperature exceeding 36 C, while midnight temperatures in Death Valley, California, soared to a staggering 49C. North America's northernmost town, Utquiagvik, Alaska, recorded its warmest single day, surpassing the previous record by almost 4 C. In Mexico, tragic heatwaves resulted in more than 200 deaths since June, with over 100 in July alone.
July's high pressure in the southwest and trough in the northeast dramatically influenced North America's solar energy production. Persistent high-pressure systems in the southwest led to frequent clear skies and warm air masses, driving up solar irradiance and enhancing
potential solar power generation.
Conversely, the northeast experienced numerous cold fronts and unsettled weather. The ensuing cloud cover and rainfall significantly reduced sunlight and solar energy output. Eastern Canada faced devastating floods due to the heaviest rainfall to hit Nova Scotia in over 50 years, with three months worth of rain falling in just one day.

According to Solcast data collected via the Solcast API, solar irradiance across most of the southern and western United States soared to 10-25% higher than long-term July averages. However, solar generation will have been severely affected by high temperatures, leading to
decreased panel efficiency and increased heat losses.
Solcast generates this monthly total data before the month-end through a mix of historic data and modeled forecasts from the Solcast API, with the total summary for July including forecast data for the final four days.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

Horizon Power, a utility owned by the Western Australia government, has signed an agreement with Perth-based energy storage company VSUN Energy for the purchase of a vanadium flow battery (VFB). It will be installed at Kununurra as part of a long-duration energy storage pilot program.
Horizon Chief Executive Officer Stephanie Unwin said the pilot program will support the organization’s focus on solving the technical challenges associated with establishing long-duration energy storage solutions in harsh conditions.
“The VFB is specifically designed to deliver large amounts of energy over a long period of time and is temperature resilient, which is critical for our unique regional and remote networks,” she said. “This is an exciting trial which will allow us to increase our understanding of the technology in a regional energy system and its ability to provide long periods of 100% renewable energy.”
VSUN Energy, a subsidiary of Perth-based mining company Australian Vanadium Ltd. (AVL), will supply, install and commission the battery energy storage system for Horizon at Kununurra. The 220 kWh battery, which will be capable of delivering up to 78 kW of power, will be sourced from UK-based manufacturer Invinity Energy Systems.
Vanadium redox flow battery technology was first developed at the University of New South Wales in the 1980s. However, it has failed to reach the same levels of acceptance that lithium-ion technology has achieved.
This is surprising for advocates of the technology who say VFBs can be charged and completely or partially discharged hundreds of thousands of times without degradation. And the electrolyte remains unchanged – it can be recycled into another battery or used in other applications when the first installation reaches its end of life. VFBs are also non-flammable, and scalable but these batteries suffer from comparatively low energy densities.
Invinity Chief Commercial Officer Matt Harper said the technology provides a “proven and commercialized” alternative to the lithium-ion battery technology which currently dominates stationary energy storage applications.
“Due to their durability, safety and reliability, vanadium flow batteries have a vital role to play in reducing the use of fossil fuels in power generation, particularly in remote communities,” he said.
Site planning and development work for the Kununurra battery is already underway, with the VFB to be delivered and installed later this year.
AVL Chief Executive Officer Graham Arvidson said the deal with Horizon is the first with an Australian energy utility and a sign of growing interest for VFB technology.
“VSUN Energy has been actively pursuing opportunities for VFB deployments and is seeing an increased interest from all energy sectors,” he said, noting Horizon’s support of the technology will also the company’s planned vertical integration ‘pit to battery’ strategy.
AVL’s flagship Australian Vanadium Project includes the mining, concentrating and processing of vanadium for use in electrolyte production. The project includes the extraction of high-grade vanadium from AVL’s mine near Meekatharra in the state’s mid-west and transporting to its Tenindewa plant for processing.
“Future VFB projects in Australia will not only be deployed locally, but have significant local content, including AVL’s vanadium electrolyte from its plant which is currently under construction in Wangara,” Arvidson said.

The company has over 78 GW in its order backlog, driving the addition of more factories. First Solar continues to book module orders well into the future as demand for US-made solar components remains red hot due to domestic manufacturing incentives created by the US Inflation Reduction Act and an increased emphasis on renewables in utilities and corporate procurement plans. 
Over the last year, First Solar has announced more than $2.8 billion in capital investments in 7.9 GW of manufacturing capacity additions – all in the United States. The company previously announced an approximately $1.3 billion investment in a new 3.5 GW manufacturing facility in Alabama and a 0.9 GW expansion of its existing manufacturing footprint in Ohio, both of which are expected to be completed at the end of 2024. 
“By expanding America’s solar manufacturing base, and the value chains that support it, we are working to ensure that the U.S. enters the next decade in a position of strength, fully capable of producing the technology it needs to complete its transition to a sustainable energy future,” said Mark Widmar, the chief executive officer of First Solar. 
First Solar currently has 2,500 employees across the country. The company estimates that the new facility will add over 700 new jobs, which when combined with the 850 new manufacturing jobs expected to be created in Alabama and Ohio and over 100 new R&D jobs planned in Ohio, takes its total number of direct jobs in the United States to over 4,000 people across the country by 2026. The company said the newest facility, of which the location is yet to be disclosed, will be contingent on necessary permits and approvals.
First Solar released its second-quarter earnings report for 2023. The highlights included:
“The second quarter of the year continued the steady progress established in the first, as we ramped up production and delivery of our next-generation Series 7 modules, reinforced our global leadership in thin film PV with a strategic acquisition, and continued our strong bookings and ASP momentum,” said Widmar.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/28/module-prices-revert-to-descending-trajectory-after-a-brief-rally/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JULY 28, 2023",Module prices revert to descending trajectory after a brief rally,"The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for Mono PERC modules from China, fell to $0.163 per W in the aftermath of a major industry event in the country that saw market players reiterate that there is intense competition in the module sector.

The 2.98% drop – paring much of last week’s gains – comes as market players, following the China Photovoltaic Industry Association forum in Anhui, contemplated reduced bid prices for the country’s solar power projects. According to one business contact, prices in China are “crappy” and there have been “a lot of low price bids recently.” According to market participants and outcomes observed by OPIS, winning bids for Mono PERC tenders have been as low as CNY1.23 ($0.17)/W, with many significant tier-1 businesses represented.
The competition has put a strain on non-vertically integrated players, a situation exacerbated by the sheer number of module manufacturers in China. Recent bids mean “module manufacturers without their own cell lines cannot survive,” a contact said. A separate source at a smaller business described it as “the monks are many, but the porridge is little” because each bid portion is shared among more than ten companies.
Intense competition and low prices are not hallmarks of just China, however, but extend to other export markets. A source trying to expand into the Australian market noted that prices there are “incredibly low.” According to him, “some major players have already completely penetrated that market,” making it “impossible to find an opportunity to enter.”
Different from the volatility in module pricing, China Mono Grade, OPIS’ price assessment for polysilicon in the country, continues its upward movement, rose 4.13% for a third week running to CNY67.08/kg, or $8.31/kg, on the back of short-term bullish factors like delays in new producers' production ramping up and the production disruption brought on by regional power rationing. However, sources believe that this does not change the overall picture of oversupply in the China polysilicon market in the long term.
The module segment also features the same prediction view. Looking ahead, module prices are expected to decline as oversupply remains the overarching economic factor, according to sources. However, given previous comments that developers eye procurement when prices have stabilized for a few weeks, the recent notch down might put them in wait-and-see mode in the short term until prices find a floor.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.
