https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/28/new-insurance-facility-to-speed-up-low-carbon-hydrogen-energy-projects/,"HYDROGEN,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2022",New insurance facility to speed up low-carbon hydrogen projects,"Marsh has announced the launch of a first-of-its-kind insurance and reinsurance facility to provide dedicated insurance capacity for new and existing low-carbon hydrogen energy projects. The insurance broker is already in talks with clients, and said that it expects the facility to streamline the financing process.
The simplification of project insurance will accelerate hydrogen developments throughout the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Oceania.
“Dependent on the project's timeline, we hope the first attachment to the facility would  be signed before the end of the year,” Marsh Global Hydrogen Practice Leader Mark Heneghan told pv magazine. “If not, in early 2023.”
Generally, insurance brokers have to individually negotiate each insurance clause and condition, along with lender endorsements, on behalf of their clients. Marsh’s facility includes them all directly, eliminating the need for continual negotiations. It also focuses on small- to medium-sized projects.
“The facility is not designed for mega projects. We are looking at the smaller end of the scale. The contract value is somewhere in the region of $500 million to $600 million or below,” Rob Hale – Marsh's London market leader, power and renewable energy practice – told pv magazine. “Those are the operations we are targeting with this facility.”
The London-based team of the global insurance broker modeled the facility around its understanding of non-recourse project finance. They focused on all of the clauses and conditions needed to make projects bankable from an insurance standpoint. The launch marks the culmination of a 12-month process, including calls with potential clients and internal meetings through different regional offices.
“Rather than going through a normal placement process, which could take several months, the facility should be able to provide that solution very quickly, enabling either the sign-off of all the lender endorsements and agreements or, if any negotiation with the lender is required, you can have it early,” said Hale.
Similar risk-transfer programs are needed, as insurance is part of the required documentation to access financing. The insurance only kicks in when the project construction starts.
The facility is global, but it will not focus on China and Russia for now, according to the company.
“Chinese projects typically have a lot of capacity within the domestic market space, and they tend to insure home-grown projects locally,” Hale said, adding that projects in Russia are not on the table now, due to international sanctions. “One day maybe, if the sanctions are lifted.”
The facility also targets “clean hydrogen,” which does not necessarily mean blue or green hydrogen.
“If the project is outside the norm, additional discussions with the facility markets would be needed,” said Heneghan.
Marsh expects the facility to gain momentum in the months and years ahead. As more projects are insured, more information is generated about risks to be covered by insurance, simplifying the whole process and streamlining hydrogen projects.
However, it is too early to speak about possible market share, according to Marsh. The company noted that there will be plenty of opportunities for other insurance organizations in the coming years, especially after 2030. 
“Globally, $13 trillion needs to be invested by 2050 – that is an extensive amount of capital expenditure that has to happen,” Heneghan said. “We are now at around $500 billion to $700 billion dollars announced by 2030, so much more still needs to be done.”

The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 brings new emphasis on American-made products that support the transition to clean energy. The IRA includes more than $60 billion for domestic manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain, as the country seeks to source from within to support its own supply chain. The US-made solar supply chain is lacking in some core components, including backsheets. However, Endurans Solar is one U.S.-based manufacturer, and the company recently announced plans to expand production.
The HP backsheets are currently manufactured in Nashua, New Hampshire using what the company says is a unique, lamination-free, co-extrusion process that delivers superior protective qualities, based on a novel material stack. The backsheet is made from PFAS-free, fully recyclable polyolefin formulations, and the company reports that it has up to a 30% lower carbon footprint compared to traditional products.
Endurans Solar’s fully recyclable HPO – high-performance polyolefin – backsheets (HP) feature what Endurans says is the strongest core layer in the industry whereas the conductive backsheets (CB) enable high-efficiency and aesthetically pleasing solar modules based on backcontact technology. Unlike laminated backsheet, co-extruded backsheets are thermoplastics and can be fully remelted, reprocessed and reshaped, according to Endurans. More than 20 million modules featuring these UL-certified backsheets have been installed worldwide.
To accommodate the anticipated increasing demand both in the United States and overseas, Endurans Solar plans to significantly increase its US backsheet manufacturing capacity. The company is currently finalizing site selection for a new manufacturing plant, with the new line expected to become operational in mid-2023.
“We’re excited that many more millions of solar panels will be manufactured and installed in the US over the coming years, and we look forward to supporting the growth of US solar panel manufacturers with our high-performance, sustainable and made-in-America backsheets,” said Nathan Arbitman, president of Endurans Solar.
Endurans Solar is a wholly owned subsidiary of Worthen Industries, with production facilities across Asia, Europe, in addition to the United States.

Since being acquired in 2018 by compatriot private equity company Rivean Capital – formerly Gilde Buy Out Partners – Esdec has embarked on a spree of acquisitions which, according to a post on Blackstone's website in July, saw it grow from around €30 million ($28.9 million) of annual sales in the Benelux countries to €500 million across three continents.
Esdec snapped up fellow Dutch businesses Solarstell and Solar Construct and also bolted on US rivals Quick Mount, IronRidge, EcoFasten, and PanelClaw.
Blackstone announced its intent to invest in an unspecified percentage of Esdec shares in July.
“The company is well-positioned to benefit from attractive organic market growth and consolidation opportunities in the years to come,” Blackstone said of Esdec in July.
The commission is considering whether the move, which would see Blackstone take joint ownership of the business, is in line with its merger and acquisition rules.
The EU executive has asked for submissions on the proposed deal by Saturday, Oct. 8.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/28/new-production-process-could-double-wafer-throughput-to-up-to-20000-per-hour/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2022","New production process could double wafer throughput to up to 20,000 per hour","A group of plant manufacturers, metrology companies, and research institutions led by Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) has optimized several steps of the production process for silicon solar cells, resulting in a throughput of 15,000 to 20,000 wafers per hour – approximately double the usual amount.
One of the innovations involves the integration of the diffusion process, combining the doping of solar and the thermal oxidization of the wafers in a single step. Thermal oxidization of wafers is usually performed in furnaces, with wafers transported through the furnace in so-called quartz rack boats. Wafers are usually placed in these boats individually, but the researchers optimized the process by stacking the wafers on top of each other in special quartz boats. The resultant oxidization process creates the final doping profile and achieves surface passivation at the same time, increasing the throughput of the process by a factor of 2.4.
In the next step of the process, contact with the imprinted electrodes on both sides of the silicon solar cells is formed in inline furnaces. To increase throughput at this stage, the researchers installed a considerably faster belt speed in the furnace, bypassing the standard need for a significantly larger heating chamber. The group compared the quality of the sintered solar cells with today’s standard, and found that throughput increases significantly without compromising the efficiency of the solar cells.
Whereas processes like these were accelerated, others “needed to be reinvented from scratch,” said Florian Clement, project manager at Fraunhofer ISE. In one of the new developments, the researchers implemented a new on-the-fly laser equipment that continually processes the wafers as they move at high speed under the laser scanner. For the metallization of solar cells, the consortium introduced rotary screen printing instead of flatbed screen printing, the current standard process. This technique could considerably reduce the amount of silver needed for the production of solar cells, while maintaining high levels of power conversion efficiency.
Finally, the researchers devised two new concepts to speed up the testing of cells by future production lines: a contactless method and a method using sliding contacts. Cells can be accurately measured at a continuous speed of 1.9 meters per second with the new methods. The team has filed for a patent for the contactless method.
The consortium is presenting detailed results from the research project this week at the World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion in Milan, Italy. China still produces most of the world's silicon solar cells – as high as 78% in 2021 – so the group sees the results of the project as a way to make European factories more competitive.
“In order to deploy more solar installations as quickly as possible and to make our supply chains more robust, Europe should re-establish its own production centers for high-efficiency solar cells,” said Ralf Preu, division director of PV production technology at Fraunhofer ISE. “By boosting throughput and making production technology more resource-efficient, we can cut costs considerably and unlock sustainability potential that we will be able to leverage thanks to process knowledge and engineering excellence.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/28/new-electroluminescence-tech-for-daily-solar-module-inspections/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2022",New electroluminescence tech for daily solar module inspections,"From pv magazine Spain
Solar cells are the main components of PV modules and the presence of defects inside them – such as cracks, fissures or faulty contacts – can affect their performance and contribute to power losses. Electroluminescence (EL) tests are an increasingly used tool, together with thermography tests, to check panels.
EL offers high-resolution images to provide useful information on the state of the cells, such as the quality of the busbar welding, for example. By visualizing a very wide range of defects, it is easier to assess the condition of solar panels.
However, the technology is not easy to apply. The need to polarize the modules to inject a current that produces the luminescence of the cells, the low intensity of the signal, and the high environmental noise make it necessary to work at night, when the solar panels are not generating electricity.
Spanish startup GdS Optronlab Group and Enertis Applus+ have developed a device based on the use of cameras that are sensitive to the near-infrared, which allows daytime electroluminescence measurements to be carried out, in solar radiation environments, without the need to disassemble panels.
The prototype incorporates software with a wide range of image capture and processing procedures. It can create images in different conditions (night and day) and in automated processes.
The company said the results produce good signal-to-noise quality images, as during the day it is possible to obtain the signal emitted by the module, eliminating the light (or noise) generated by neighboring objects when receiving the natural light. Having a high signal-to-noise quality is particularly important when an electroluminescence image of sufficient quality is required to analyze the quality status of a module. In addition, the system is controlled by a micro PC and can be run on any Android mobile device.
The companies tested the prototype both in real operating conditions – in several PV plants, under different values of irradiation and cloud cover – and in a more controlled system, within a pilot plant in the laboratory. They said the results have shown that the prototype facilitates diurnal electroluminescence tests in an efficient way, optimizing the time of image acquisition.
Specifically, the system enables the simultaneous polarization of entire strings of modules, reducing the number of connections and disconnections and the probability of accidental errors. It has been possible to inspect up to 80 panels per hour in daytime electroluminescence with high-quality images, comparable to those obtained in laboratories. The results also pave the way for substantial improvements in the acquisition of nocturnal electroluminescence images, the companies claim.
They said the prototype has important operational advantages, such as the reduction of auxiliary elements and the presence of a wireless connection to facilitate mobility in difficult environments. This opens the door to massive electroluminescence tests in real operating conditions during the day.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/28/fimer-secures-e45-million-of-funds-announces-relaunch/,"BANKRUPTCY,LEGAL,ITALY",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2022","Fimer secures €45 million of funds, announces relaunch","From pv magazine Spain
Fimer has announced an industrial relaunch after entering composition-with-creditors proceedings at a tribunal in Arezzo, Italy.
The Italian inverter manufacturer filed for creditor protection with the same court in February. According to Italian legislation, the composition-with-creditors procedure is a contractual settlement between a debtor and its creditors. The arrangement gives a business the chance to restructure its debt obligations and continue as a going concern.
The company presented its new industrial plan to the tribunal in late June.
“It was developed to achieve a full recovery of the activities of production of solar inverters and charging solutions for electric vehicles,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The Fimer representative said the industrial plan is designed to help the company to recover from the financial impact of the pandemic, components shortages, and global issues with raw materials. The source said that these factors contributed to the “emergence and subsequent worsening of cash liquidity and the slowdown of production activities.”
The spokesperson also said that Fimer has received €45 million ($42.9 million) in funds from GeneralFinance.
“This support will enable the company to purchase raw materials and essential components to ensure the full recovery of production activities,” the company said, adding that the considerable backlog of orders will, in turn, help to cover costs related to the start of the production process for new products.
Fimer has two inverter factories in Italy. It acquired one of them from Swiss conglomerate ABB in 2020. The company employs more than 1,000 people throughout the world and is present in more than 20 countries, with local training centers and manufacturing sites.

The move, which is subject to regulatory approvals, was jointly announced in a press release issued by the two companies this week. The purchase price for Daystar was not revealed.
The Lagos-based company installs and operates solar arrays on commercial rooftops in Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Togo. Clients receive cheaper electricity from the panels and also have the option of systems with energy storage.
Daystar said Shell's backing would enable it to expand operations into other sub-Saharan African markets and to reach 400 MW of solar generation capacity by 2025.
“We have seen booming demand for solar energy in the African markets where we operate,” said Jasper Graf von Hardenberg, CEO and co-founder of Daystar. “That has been reflected in our growth: we are on-track to increase our installed solar capacity by 135% in 2022. As part of Shell we will be able to execute our mission even faster to deliver carbon emission reductions and power cost savings to businesses across Africa.”
The news comes days after the announcement of a planned merger between fellow African C&I solar companies Starsight Energy and SolarAfrica.
Starsight, also based in Lagos, has operations in Nigeria and Ghana. Last year, it bought half the East African operation of Nairobi-based peer Premier Solar Group, giving it a foothold in Kenya.
The installer – backed by London-based private equity investor Helios Investment Partners, the African Infrastructure Investment Managers (AIIM) entity partly owned by South African lender Old Mutual – will merge with South African C&I player SolarAfrica, subject to regulatory approvals.
A press release published by the two companies last week on the Africa Solar Industry Association website said the combined company would offer installations ranging from rooftop arrays up to big, PPA-backed solar projects for commercial clients.
The new entity will have more than 220 MW of solar generation capacity, 40 MWh of battery storage and a development pipeline of more than 1 GW.
Starsight and SolarAfrica said Old Mutual has vowed to invest more in solar projects in South Africa, due to recent regulatory changes that allow independent energy companies to challenge the dominance of troubled state utility Eskom.
Old Mutual said it would channel the funds into the newly merged C&I business via AIIM. The businesses said that “further pan-African diversification” would be considered, and hinted at possible moves into north and central Africa.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/28/solar-energy-tax-credits-are-a-boon-to-blockchain-technology-solutions/,"FINANCE,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2022",Solar energy tax credits are a boon to blockchain technology solutions,"The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has been reinstated for solar projects under the IRA. This allows solar projects to choose between the PTC and the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) to maximize their economics. The IRA also introduces a new “technology neutral” PTC and ITC  for solar projects that generate electricity and yield zero greenhouse emissions by types of facilities that are defined as causing zero greenhouse emissions.  The tax credit is expected to accelerate solar generation over the next decade with facilities placed in service after December 31, 2024, and phasing down by 2032, or when the US's electricity sector emissions are 75% below 2022 levels.
The IRA generally allows for the transfer of solar tax credits between taxpayers, provided, for example, the tax credits are paid for in cash and provided the amount paid is neither calculated as income by the seller nor deducted by the buyer. There are limited exceptions to this ability to transfer tax credits, including in the case of, for example, certain tax-exempt transferors and government entities that can take advantage of direct pay – a refund from the Treasury for the amount of tax credit claimed.
The IRA is expected to increase solar capacity installation by 67% over 10 years, which stood at approximately 2.5% of US electricity generation in 2021 according to Wood Mackenzie. The long-life span of these tax credits are expected to improve cash flow visibility for solar projects and the development of new technologies as laid out in a series of federal reports commissioned by the Biden Administration on Mar. 9, 2022 executive order 14067: “Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets,” that support responsible digital asset development, in line with the country’s climate change objectives.
The report by the Technology Policy (OSTP) examines the connections between distributed ledger technologies (DLT) and energy transitions, the potential for these technologies to impede or advance efforts to tackle climate change at home and abroad, and the impacts these technologies have on the environment. Blockchain technology has the potential to transform the solar energy sector, which has been consistently catalyzed by innovations including rooftop solar, solar electric vehicles, and smart grid metering, and the US government has a responsibility to “protect” people from pollution and climate change caused by energy intensive blockchain technologies.
The OSTP Report and a study on layout blockchain technology applications in electricity smart microgrids look at promoting techno-socio-economic innovations for the restructuring of the sustainable energy supply chain by potentially enabling distributed energy resource coordination, as well as broader supply chain management. For example, the OSTP Report points out that “DLT-supported innovation could help digitize, automate, and decentralize the operation of the electricity grid.”
“The emerging uses of blockchain technologies for energy management include enabling California’s Flex Alert system. This system enables the electricity grid operator to push out requests for energy conservation during a grid emergency, securely interact with customers, and understand participation rates while maintaining customer anonymity,” wrote the authors.
They continue, “They could also enable community-created microgrids where resources are shared peer-to-peer (P2P) within the community. DLT could be helpful in managing the P2P relationships on these microgrids. These microgrids are typically virtual grids, in which electricity is traded across the grid operator-owned network. In addition to satisfying customers’ preference to produce and consume within their community, localizing the generation and consumption of electricity could reduce grid congestion, which benefits users inside and outside of the community. P2P energy trading requires some of the same enabling technologies as crypto-assets, namely cryptography-based user authentication, a market-making mechanism and payment system via smart contracts, a tamper-resistant ledger of transactions, and complete auditability. P2P energy trading on networks could use low-energy consumption consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS).”
Ethereum, the world’s most popular crypto platform, recently switched to a more eco-friendly processing technique called PoS which is being welcomed by US lawmakers.  “The Merge” made fundamental changes to the Ethereum network such as improving sustainability and security, setting it up for scalability, and offering an attractive real yield on staking.
A new report from Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute, commissioned by ConsenSys, a New York and Ethereum based blockchain company, revealed that Ethereum’s transition from Proof of Work to PoS has reduced the electricity consumption and carbon footprint of the network by over 99.988 % and 99.992%, respectively. This is expected to “help the US meet its climate objectives of a 50% to 52% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, a carbon pollution-free electricity system by 2035, and a net-zero emissions economy no later than 2050.”
Another low-energy blockchain platform “Rubix, backed by a $100 million investment from US-based venture firm, LDA Capital, is a global blockchain platform powered by a breakthrough green technology” that the founder and Chief Architect KC Reddy said he developed. “Rubix establishes a low carbon, high-efficiency architecture based on a Proof-of-Pledge protocol which has zero transaction fees and one of the lowest energy consumption rates among all computing networks at less than 1 kWh per transaction,” he said.
Undoubtedly there is potential for blockchain and DLT to facilitate the development of solar energy markets, distributed energy resource coordination, and general supply chain management. With the IRA the US government is supporting and facilitating innovation in blockchain technology solutions that aligns with environmental and equity objectives.

Jetten made the statement in response to a parliamentary interrogation designed to clarify net metering billing practices, by a member of the conservative Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) party.
“All providers have complied with the yearly billing for many years but in recent times, with the current spikes in the electricity market, some of them are implementing their billing practices on a monthly or quarterly basis,” Dutch solar analyst Peter Segaar told pv magazine. “This is aimed at trying to fully bill prosumers at high tariffs during high consumption periods with low solar production such as the winter.”
Dutch energy providers long adjusted electricity tariffs every six months, but they recently started to adjust them on a quarterly and even monthly basis.
“This has dramatic consequences for the way in which the net metering principle is handled in many cases,” Segaar said. “Jetten is going to make this all more explicit in the new Law texts, but also stresses that it always has been its intention.”
In June, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) began looking at whether energy suppliers have been buying surplus solar power from prosumers under the nation's net-metering regime at lower tariffs than what is considered a “reasonable price.” Jetten said at the time that a reasonable minimum fee for surplus solar energy would be at least 80% of the energy price that prosumers pay to buy power from the grid, minus taxes.
Jetten said that the introduction of new net-metering rules in the future could help to identify a lower limit for such tariffs, which would in turn bring more certainty to the Dutch residential PV market.

“The OGS-3.6-6 inverter supports PV input current up to 15 A, which is compatible with all mainstream solar modules in the market to prevent power loss due to the current limit of high-power modules,” said the Chinese inverter manufacturer.
There are four versions of the new inverters, with rated outputs of 3.6 kW, 4.2 kW, 5.0 kW, and 6.0 kW. All the products have an efficiency rating of 98.1% and a European efficiency of 97.5%.
They measure 358 mm × 300 mm × 158 mm and weigh in at 9.8 kg. The maximum input voltage is 600 V and the MPP voltage range is between 50 V and 500 V. The inverters also feature IP65-rated protection and have cooling systems based on natural convection.
They all have an MPPT efficiency of 99.9%, and a night power consumption of less than 100 milliwatts. The manufacturer also offers a five-year warranty.
“With 110% continuous overloading capacity, 60V start- up voltage and export control ability, these inverters can provide excellent performance during operation,” said Solinteg.
