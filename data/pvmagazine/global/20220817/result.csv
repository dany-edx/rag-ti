https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/17/shoals-reports-record-revenue-profit-despite-challenges/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"AUGUST 17, 2022","Shoals reports record Q2 revenue, profit despite challenges","Despite the headwinds the US solar industry faced in the second quarter of 2022, following the Department of Commerce’s (DoC) announcement of a solar antidumping investigation in late March, balance-of-system (BoS) manufacturer Shoals has reported record revenue and gross profit, as well as a gross margin within its targeted range.
The US-based provider of BoS solutions for solar, battery storage, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure attributed the results to a significant number of new customers purchasing components, as well as strong demand for its combine-as-you-go system.
Earlier this year, Shoals adjusted its guidance for the year due to the “challenging environment” caused by the DoC’s March 28 decision to act on a petition filed by California-based solar module manufacturer Auxin Solar. It asked the DoC to review solar panel imports from Chinese companies in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, resulting in an antidumping investigation. Despite this, Shoals reported robust growth across its business.
“Demand for our combine-as-you-go solution continues to grow,” said Jason Whitaker, chief executive officer of Shoals. “During the quarter we converted four additional customers, bringing the total BLA [Shoals' in-line fuse and wire manufacturing technology] customers to 29. Customer interest in our recently introduced products is strong, particularly within battery storage, wire management, and EV charging.”
Turning point
According to Whitaker, the White House's two-year tariff exemption for solar panels manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam was “a turning point in customer sentiment, and we have seen order patterns normalize as a result.” The company’s revenue grew 23% year 0n year to $73.5 million, driven by increases in its components and system solutions divisions.
The growth in components-related revenue was driven by increases in shipments of battery storage products and solar products to a significant number of new customers, the company said. It noted that new customers typically purchase components first, before transitioning to system solutions.
The company said the growth in system solutions revenue underscored strong demand for its combine-as-you-go system. Its system solutions division accounted for 77% of revenue in the quarter, from 86% a year earlier and 69% in the prior quarter.
Gross profit increased 9% to $28.6 million, compared to $26.2 million in the preceding year. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 38.9%, compared to 43.8% in the prior-year period. The company attributed this to a higher mix of components sales in the quarter, as they have lower margins than system solutions, as well as higher raw material prices and logistics costs.
For its full-year outlook, Shoals still expects revenues to be in the range of $300 million to $325 million, adjusted EBITDA between $77 million and $86 million, and adjusted net income between $45 million and $53 million.
Earlier this year, Shoals opened a new manufacturing facility in Tennessee. It is expected to double the company’s manufacturing capacity as demand continues to grow. It said that its BoS solutions have now been deployed on more than 20 GW of solar systems across the world.

Currently, sophisticated synchrotron X-ray or electron microscopy are the most often used techniques in visualizing active battery materials. However, they can be complicated and expensive, and not quick enough to capture the rapid changes happening in electrode materials.
Now, researchers at the University of Cambridge have applied a low-cost, laboratory-based optical microscopy method to study micrometer-sized rod-like particles of one of the fastest charging anode material today (Nb14W3O44) during high-rate cycling. They described their method in “Operando monitoring of single-particle kinetic state-of-charge heterogeneities and cracking in high-rate Li-ion anodes,” which was recently published in Nature Materials.
First, visible light was sent into the battery through a small glass window, allowing the researchers to watch the dynamic process within the active particles, in real time, under realistic non-equilibrium conditions. This revealed front-like lithium-concentration gradients moving through the individual active particles, resulting in internal strain which caused some particles to fracture. Particle fracture is a problem in batteries, as it can lead to electrical disconnection of the fragments, reducing the storage capacity of the battery.
“Such spontaneous events have severe implications for the battery but could never be observed in real time before now,” said researcher Christoph Schnedermann, from Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory.
The optical microscopy technique allowed the researchers to analyze a large population of particles. This revealed that particle cracking is more common with higher rates of delithiation and in longer particles.
“These findings provide directly-applicable design principles to reduce particle fracture and capacity fade in this class of materials” said researcher Alice Merryweather, a PhD candidate in Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory and Chemistry Department.
In addition to the rapid data acquisition, single-particle resolution, and high throughput capabilities, the novel technique is expected to facilitate further exploration of what happens when batteries fail and how to prevent it. It could also play a role in the development of next-generation batteries, as it can be used to study almost any type of battery material.

The number of off-grid properties in Australia is growing rapidly, albeit from a low baseline. The number of off-grid properties for sale in 2020 was just 809. By 2022, there was 1362 – close to a 70% increase. By comparison, the number of solar houses on the market increased by just 26% in that same period.
Commodore Independent Energy Systems, which has long specialized in solar water pumps, is increasingly gearing its business toward off-grid systems, with a specific focus on making units that are compact, easy to install, and highly portable.
“We’re noticing the demand is there,” Marketing Manager Matt Miller told pv magazine Australia.
He noted that it’s now common for a system’s payback to be competed within its warranty period. But he believes the biggest barrier for most potential customers is the complexity of off-grid systems.
“People just have no idea how off-grid systems work,” he claimed.
To tackle this, the company has begun pre-wiring and pre-programming its systems – something a handful of other companies are now also offering in Australia.
“We’re finding electricians are absolutely loving it,” Miller said. “No one has to look through 200 pages of literature.”
Commodore now has 10 electricians devoted solely to pre-wiring and pre-programming units inside the warehouse. Once the system is on site, Miller says the cabinet only takes a few hours to install – though the total duration depends on how much solar is being installed alongside the system. “This completely changes the game,” Miller says.
Just last week, Chinese company EcoFlow began marketing its new EcoFlow Power Kits for tiny homes and camper vans in Australia. The system focuses on ease and simplicity, putting components like the battery system, charging system, DC converter and inverter together in a preconfigured box.

Hygenco India has signed India’s first long-term green hydrogen offtake agreement with Jindal Stainless. The agreement will see Hygenco build, own and operate a multi-megawatt green hydrogen facility for a period of 20 years.
The plant will purportedly be the first multi-megawatt scale plant with a long-term offtake agreement in Asia to be commissioned in the next 12 months. The  plant will help Jindal Stainless to reduce its carbon emissions by about 2,700 metric tons per year.
“This is one of the most significant landmarks for the hydrogen industry in India and globally as it demonstrates the competitiveness and cost-efficiency of green hydrogen.,” said Amit Bansal, the CEO of Hygenco.
The plant will be controlled by an advanced energy management and control system. The system monitors several parameters, including hydrogen generation, renewable energy generation, states of charge, pressure, and temperature and makes autonomous real-time decisions for achieving high efficiency.
Hygenco plans to invest more than $300 million in green hydrogen projects across India over the next three years. The large-scale adoption of green hydrogen will be vital for India, which depends on energy imports. This will significantly push the government’s ambitious National Hydrogen Mission, which envisages the production of 5 million tons of green hydrogen by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/17/metal-roofing-for-solar-pv/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"AUGUST 17, 2022",Metal roofing for solar PV,"From pv magazine USA
Within the past four decades, well over 2 billion square feet of metal roofing has been installed in the United States each year. That number continues to grow, and it’s more than any other roof type except asphalt shingle.
The roots and technology of metal as a cladding material date back more than 3,000 years. It has always been coveted as a premium roofing option but, until more recent history, has been handicapped by higher initial costs than the alternatives. Beginning in the mid-1800s and continuing to the present day, production technologies and the use of aluminum and coated steel sheeting began to narrow the premium price chasm. Now it competes with other premium roof materials but lasts two to four times as long.
Today’s trends point toward evaluating the long-term costs of owning a roof, as landfills are overburdened with former building components discarded due to shortsighted budget-conscious building objectives. The life-cycle costs and environmental appeal of metal truly offer many advantages. As a result, metal is becoming the roofing material of choice for both commercial and residential applications.
Service life
Metal roofing is known for its durability, sustainability and versatility and is increasing in popularity in the solar marketplace.  The metal roof is the ideal host for mounting PV, as it is the only roof type with a service life that actually exceeds the service life of a solar PV system.
In the commercial/industrial market sector, the field/lab study published by the Metal Construction Association indicates that the service life of (standing seam) coated steel is in the range of 70 years. Most alternative roofing systems will expire long before the life of the PV system. This leads to costly disassembly of the PV array, re-roofing and re-assembly.
The service life of solar PV is between 28 and 37 years with an average at 32.5 years, according to a Berkeley study.  Aside from metal, there are no other roof types that measure up to that without requiring replacement. High-end slate or tile may be the only exception, but it comes with a high price tag and is also much heavier (5 to 8 psf vs. 1.5). Mounting solar to tile or slate is a bit complex and very tricky to do without breakage so the cost is also much higher than mounting to metal.
Going ‘rail-less'
It is easier and less expensive to mount solar to a metal roof than any other roof type. The uniqueness of metal roofing is that the structural ribs or seams can be used as inherent (and cost-free) “rails” for mounting solar PV via reliable mechanical attachments, so the need for a traditional rail system is eliminated.
Direct attachment of solar modules to a metal roof can be accomplished with fewer components and lightweight materials, resulting in better load distribution and zero penetration, which preserves both the integrity of the roof and the roof manufacturer’s warranty.
Because there are no rails, the material required for a mounting system is reduced by weight (up to 85%) and savings on hard goods (up to 35%). The key to labor savings (30% to 50%) is the simplicity of rail-less attachment: requiring 65% to 75% fewer components, roof clamps are aligned and installed as modules are installed “on the fly.”
Finally, shipping long lengths of rail to project sites and transporting them up to a rooftop is costly and often a logistical nightmare.  With rail-less attachments, shipping costs for the mounting system can be 60% lower than railed mounting systems, with fewer logistical hassles transporting the product to distribution, then the site, and then within the site and onto the roof.  A traditional rail system of 750 kW would normally require a semi-truck to transport; a rail-less attachment solution could fit in a short-bed pickup truck.
Whether railed or rail-less, the simplicity and cost savings of mounting to a metal roof are significant, and the future need of roof replacement is avoided.
Metal roofing is the most sustainable roof type (at an 85% recycle rate, steel is one of the most recycled construction materials available). By installing solar on metal roofs with lower material, labor and shipping costs, the rail-less attachment solution is proving to be a “green” innovation in both the solar and roofing industries.
Recyclable metal roofs have a demonstrated service life of several times that of any other roof type and are never destined for a landfill. Therefore, solar metal roof attachments enable installation on most aged roofs without a roof replacement.  Production of rail-less systems saves an estimated 90% of the energy used to produce rail mountings and 85% of carbon emissions in transportation.
Lifetime ROI
Once the decision is made to install solar, often a new roof is required.  Metal roofing has become a driver for roof type selection in many cases because not only is a metal/solar roof system less expensive upfront than other roof system combinations, but it also leads to improvements in the lifetime return on investment (ROI) of the system. Therefore, the PV array and the roof should be regarded as a single asset.
When computing ROI within the solar pro forma, inverter replacement is usually factored in at about year 15 – but what about the cost of roof replacement?  The solar array has to be totally dismantled and then re-installed on the replacement roof.  Often, even the initial cost of the solar + metal roof is less than solar and other roof-type alternatives.  Factor in roof replacement and the cost advantages become grossly magnified.
A number of exorbitant expenses associated with completing a PV system re-roof for a traditional (non-metal) roof could include: removing the solar modules; removing the mounting and racking system; de-commissioning the system during the reroof; re-roofing; re-installing the PV system; re-commissioning the system; the potential for damaged components during this process; possibly needing new wiring and loss of power production during downtime.
With metal, you can avoid roof replacement due to its long service life. The roof will still be going strong long after the service life of the solar array has expired.
With the cost of solar decreasing significantly over the last decade, in addition to federal and local incentives as well as public policy mandates driving the popularity of solar, the breakeven and ROI improves every year – evident even more with solar on metal roofs because of its lower installation costs, so it makes even greater financial sense.
Metal is the most solar-friendly roof available and the PV contractor should know about it. Metal roofing is attractive, durable, non-flammable and requires almost no maintenance. The “buy-it-cheap and fix-it-later” mentality has steadily diminished over the last few decades and more building owners are choosing metal than ever before.
The growing demand for more durable and environmentally-friendly construction materials, as well as methods that reduce maintenance and have longer service lives, is on the rise―evident by statistics clearly indicating that metal has a much larger share of replacement roofing than it does in new roofing within the residential market.
Solar contractors should know about roofing alternatives and their service lives to bring added value to their customers. The long-term costs of both the roof and solar PV should be evaluated as a single system.  Advising the mounting of a solar array with a 30-year plus life on a TPO or asphalt shingle roof with a 15-year life is a bit like mounting a Ferrari engine on a Mini-Cooper chassis.  Who would do that?

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/17/biden-signs-largest-climate-energy-package-in-us-history/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 17, 2022","Biden signs largest climate, energy package in US history","From pv magazine USA
US President Joe Biden has signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 into law, marking the largest climate and energy spending package in US history. The massive energy, climate, and tax bill includes $600 billion in spending, $370 billion of which is dedicated to supporting renewable energy and climate resilience.
The IRA mandates a nationwide reduction of carbon emissions by roughly 40% in 2030. The policy package is also aimed at creating energy savings for Americans. The Biden administration said 7.5 million more families will be able install solar on their roofs with a 30% tax credit. Families that take advantage of clean energy, efficiency, and electric vehicle tax credits will save more than $1000 a year, said the administration.
The spending will be supported by closing tax loopholes on the wealthiest Americans and corporations. The administration said 55 of the largest corporations paid $0 in taxes in 2020, and the top 1% of earners are estimated to avoid $160 million in taxes each year. By closing tax loopholes and placing a 15% minimum tax on the largest, most profitable corporations, the IRA is expected to save the United States more than $124 billion over the next 10 years.
Solar energy is set to play a central role in the decarbonization and onshoring of U.S. energy. By 2030, it is estimated the IRA will lead to the installation of 950 million solar panels, 120,000 wind turbines, and 2,300 grid-scale battery plants.
“Americans can now rest assured that our leaders have acted to lower costs, strengthen American energy independence, and create hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs, all while combatting the damaging impacts of climate change,” said George Hershman, CEO of SOLV Energy, a leading utility-scale solar developer.
The key to this buildout is the 10-year extension of the Investment Tax Credit at 30% for commercial and residential projects, including those installed in 2022. For larger solar projects, above 1 MW, the tax credit is default at 6%. To be eligible for the additional 24%, laborers and mechanics installing the solar power projects must be paid prevailing wages. There are 10% adders for having a specified amount of domestic content in a project, another 10% for siting projects in specified locations, and additional credits for clean energy production.
“What an historic moment for our country! Sunrun applauds everyone in Congress and the Biden Administration who helped accomplish this major step forward for humanity. The Inflation Reduction Act will combat inflation, lower energy prices and help our country meet its climate goals. It will boost U.S. manufacturing, create millions of good-paying jobs, expand access and equity for those who need it most, and improve grid stability and resilience,” said Mary Powell, the CEO of Sunrun.
Domestic manufacturing provisions are central in this law. Production tax credits, roughly $30 billion, will be assigned to U.S. manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals processing. And, $10 billion in investment tax credits will be distributed for facilities that make EVs, wind turbines and solar panels.
The Defense Production Act holds $500 million for heat pumps and critical minerals processing, and $2 billion in grants will be used to improve existing auto manufacturing facilities to create clean vehicles like EVs and hybrids. Along with these funds, up to $20 billion will be available in clean vehicle manufacturing credits. About $2 billion will be given to national labs to accelerate breakthrough energy research.
“The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act by the US House of Representatives is a victory for America. First, it represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to achieve energy security and to ensure that the fight against climate change is powered by solar technology that represents American values and principles and is produced here, at home,” said Mark Widmar, CEO of First Solar. “Second, it’s an opportunity to ensure that the benefit of this groundbreaking legislation is shared, creating jobs and economic value where needed most. And finally, it will facilitate the cycles of innovation necessary to ensure our country’s leadership in clean energy technology, ensuring that the next generation of solar technologies is developed and made by America.”
As a result of the IRA, researchers from Princeton University, Dartmouth College, Evolved Energy Research and Climate Impact Consulting noted in the Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT) that solar deployment may accelerate from 2020 rates of 10 GW of capacity added per year to nearly five times as much by 2024, adding 49 GW of utility-scale solar each year. Solar deployment may be well over 100 GW per year by 2030, said the researchers.
Investment in solar could reach $321 billion in 2030, nearly double the figure of $177 billion expected under current policy. The Act would lead to nearly $3.5 trillion in cumulative capital investment in new American energy supply through the next decade, said the report.
Annual US energy expenditures are expected to fall by at least 4% in 2030 under the act, a savings of nearly $50 billion dollars per year for households, businesses and the industry.

“Green infrastructure is the most important investment area that China is relying on to boost its weak economy in the second half of 2022,” said Nannan Kou, BNEF's head of China analysis.
BNEF said China recorded $41 billion of investment into large-scale solar in the first six months of the year, up 173% year on year.
“The investment growth trend follows China’s strategy to build new renewable generation capacity so that it can replace its existing coal fleet,” said Kou. “China is well on track to hit its 1,200 GW wind and solar capacity target by 2030.”
That $41 billion for big solar in China supplied the lion's share of the $66 billion that BNEF said was devoted to utility-scale photovoltaics throughout the world in the January-June period. The United States was the world's second-biggest large solar market in the first half, according to BNEF, with $7.5 billion invested.
With small-scale solar investment estimates bundled in, the world invested a record $120 billion in solar, including solar thermal, during the six-month period, said BNEF. That figure rose 33% year on year, despite much-publicized rising steel and polysilicon input prices, more expensive financing, logistical setbacks, and higher wholesale energy prices, according to the analyst.
While BNEF hailed a first-half record of $226 billion devoted to clean energy worldwide, but the six-month figure was actually down 12% on the investments recorded in the second half of last year, with end-of-year deadlines typically prompting more activity in the July-December period.
And while solar and wind investments roared along in the first half, the analyst noted a fall in backing for biomass, small hydro, and energy-from-waste, as well as a steepling 65% first-half, year-on-year drop in the value of public issuances of stock by clean energy companies.
Despite that fall in stock activity, Chinese solar manufacturer Tongwei raised $1.9 billion in the first half and compatriot Jinko Solar generated $1.6 billion.
With $206 billion of the $226 billion clean energy investment in the first half devoted to project backing, the pick of the bunch was the $1.1 billion invested in Huanggang Dabieshan Power Generation Co. Ltd.'s 1.3 GW solar field in China's Hubei province.
Of the $9.6 billion recorded in private equity and venture capital backing for clean energy to the end of June, the largest deal was the $755 million secured by US solar developer Silicon Ranch Corp., according to the BNEF report.
US energy company Chevron‘s $2.8 billion acquisition of Iowa-based biodiesel producer Renewable Energy Group led clean power merger and acquisition activity in the first half, ahead of the $2.6 billion paid by JP Morgan‘s Infrastructure Investments Fund for Italian developer Falck Renewables Spa, and the $1.7 billion valuation placed on Japan Renewable Energy Corp's buyout of Mitsubishi‘s energy and metals business, Eneos Holdings.

However, their widespread application has been held back by the lack of a PV colorization technology that has a low impact on power conversion efficiency (PCE) and is simultaneously mass-producible at a low cost.
To address this challenge, researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University have created solar panels that take on colorful hues while producing energy nearly as efficiently as traditional ones. They implemented a colorization strategy based on photonic glass, which was made of a thin, disorderly layer of dielectric microscopic zinc sulfide spheres.
By a fast spray coating process, they showed that the photonic glass layer could be easily deposited on silicon solar cells, enabling them to have structural colors. Through varying microsphere sizes, solar cells with different colors were achieved, showing low PCE loss compared to normal black cells.
Using this approach, the researchers created solar panels that took on blue, green, and purple hues while only dropping the efficiency of power generation from 22.6% to 21.5%. Moreover, the long-term stability was subsequently verified by aging tests including an outdoor exposure for 10 days and a damp-heat test for 1000 h and the mass producibility is demonstrated by presenting a colored PV panel with an output power over 108 W.
The researchers now plan to explore ways to make the colors more saturated, as well as methods to achieve a wider range of colors. They reported their findings in “High-Efficiency, Mass-Producible, and Colored Solar Photovoltaics Enabled by Self-Assembled Photonic Glass” which was recently published in ACS Publications.
