It has agreed to provide 2.9 GW of 545 W modules and 1 GW of 545 W mono-facial panels for CNY 5.827 billion ($854.9 million), or a unit price of around CNY 1.94 per watt. Tongwei edged out Eging PV and Longi to win the order, which will be the group's biggest ever if it proceeds as planned.
Canadian Solar has revealed that it recorded a 61.8% year-on-year increase in sale revenue to $2.3 billion in the second quarter. Profit attributable to shareholders rose to $74.46 million, on 5.06 GW of total PV module shipments, up 37% year on year. The company said it expects its module shipments to reach 6 GW to 6.2 GW in the third quarter. It also increased its annual revenue forecast to between  $7.5 billion and $8 billion, on projected full-year module shipments of 20 GW to 22 GW.
Productive Technologies revealed this week that it has secured a supply order for its wafer texturing equipment from an undisclosed customer, “the controlling shareholder of which is one of the world’s top-tier solar technology companies.” It said it will supply equipment to roughen the texture of wafers, in order to enhance their light-trapping performance. The order, sealed earlier this month, came on top of a separate deal to supply five sets of “solar cell equipment” from other, unnamed customers.
GCL New Energy has proposed the consolidation of every 20 of its shares into a consolidated share, subject to a shareholder vote at a special general meeting. The rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange suggest the need to consolidate stock if shares trade below HKD 0.10 ($0.013). GCL New Energy said its stock was trading at HKD 0.132 per share when the announcement was made earlier this week.

The aim is to establish a total storage capacity of approximately 26 million kg of hydrogen. Bilfinger will provide equipment, piping, pipelines, buildings, and related infrastructure. Gasunie, the Dutch natural gas infrastructure company, runs the HyStock project and injected hydrogen into the subsurface at the Zuidwending site in September 2021. 
Porsche has released a concept study for a hydrogen combustion engine with an output of around 440 kW and a maximum speed of 261 km/h. “The starting point for our study was an existing 4.4-liter, eight-cylinder gasoline engine – or rather, its digital data set, since we conducted the entire study virtually using engine performance simulations,” said Vincenzo Bevilacqua, senior expert engine simulation at Porsche Engineering. Modifications to the engine model included a new turbocharging system, a higher compression ratio, and combustion adapted to hydrogen. Porsche tried to solve the lower exhaust gas temperatures, which result in a lack of energy for their propulsion on the exhaust side, through a turbocharging system with back-to-back compressors. “The special feature of this design is the coaxial arrangement of two compressor stages, which are driven by the turbine or the supporting electric motor using a common shaft. The process air flows through the first compressor, is cooled in the intercooler and then recompressed in the second stage,” wrote the German automobile manufacturer.
Fusion Fuel has received confirmation from the Portuguese government that it will secure an estimated €10 million grant to develop its 6.6MW HEVO-Industria green hydrogen project in Sines, Portugal. “The HEVO-Industria project, which is expected to take FID in the first half of 2023 and require €25 million of capital investment, consists of 300 HEVO-Solar units along with a hydrogen refueling station and associated balance of plant to support local industry, and will produce an estimated 764 tons of green hydrogen per annum,” wrote the Irish hydrogen company. Fusion Fuel, which focuses on PEM electrolysis, said that the green hydrogen is expected to be used for mobility and industrial applications in Sines, or blended in the natural gas grid.
Woodside Energy, BGC, and Centurion are advancing plans for a hydrogen production, storage, and refueling station in the Rockingham Industry Zone, Australia. The companies plan to deploy a 2 MW electrolyzer, powered by renewable energy sourced from the South West Interconnected System during periods of excess solar in the grid. “With matched funding from Woodside, the proposal targets delivery of hydrogen fuel at a globally competitive price of AUD 11 ($7.57) per kilo and subsidizes a number of large hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles,” wrote the Australian petroleum company. Woodside has signed non-binding offtake memoranda of understanding with BGC and Centurion. The project should be located adjacent to Woodside’s proposed H2Perth project, a proposed domestic and export-scale hydrogen and ammonia production facility. The Australian government selected the project for its AUD 10 million Hydrogen Fuelled Transport Program.
The Queensland state government has opened a consultation on a hydrogen project proposal in Gladstone, Australia, after releasing draft terms of reference for the environmental impact statement. The AUD 4.7 billion project has a planned capacity of up to 3 GW of electrolysis and up to 5,000 tons per day of green ammonia production.
Shell and H2 Mobility Germany have commissioned a filling station at the Wesseling Shell station near the city of Cologne. H2 Mobility Deutschland built the station using Linde’s filling station technology. Shell operates a 10 MW PEM electrolyzer to produce green hydrogen at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland near the filling station.

The project will feature 300 of the company’s HEVO-solar hydrogen generators integrated with a hydrogen refueling station. The generators combine 144 miniaturized PEM electrolyzers fixed to the back of high-efficiency concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) panels, which are installed with CPV trackers.
Developing the project will require €25 million in capital investment. An estimated 764 tons of green hydrogen will be produced per year, which is expected to be used for mobility and industrial applications in Sines or blended in the natural gas grid.
The facility will be equipped with Fusion Fuel’s HEVO-Night solution to allow for production of green hydrogen overnight or during periods of low solar irradiation. The funding was approved under Component 14 (C-14) of the Portuguese Recovery and Resilience Plan.
“HEVO-Industria is one of several projects focused on building out the hydrogen mobility backbone in Iberia, headlined by our Exolum project currently being built in Madrid,” said Zach Steele, co-head of Fusion Fuel. “Our ability to deploy decentralized, small-scale green hydrogen production commercially and co-locate it with refuelling stations is a meaningful competitive advantage at a time when scale is viewed as the only way to drive down cost. On-site production allows us to avoid last-mile logistics of hydrogen, which can add €1/kg to €2/kg to the delivered cost to the end user. We believe this is a winning strategy for us, particularly as governments in Europe and abroad begin to strengthen their commitment to hydrogen mobility.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/19/us-solar-industry-eyes-50-gw-of-manufacturing-capacity-by-2030/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 19, 2022",US solar industry eyes 50 GW of manufacturing capacity by 2030,"From pv magazine USA
Following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, an energized solar industry is aiming high and envisioning a future in which the United States has a robust domestic energy supply chain. SEIA's new roadmap charts a path to achieving this goal, with a target of 50 GW of annual solar manufacturing capacity by 2030. 
The United States has been plagued by numerous pressures threatening the supply of solar modules imported from overseas. With decarbonization and climate goals under threat due to this shortage, the country is now turning to boosting domestic manufacturing to power the energy transition. 
“Greatly expanding US PV manufacturing could mitigate global supply chain challenges and lead to tremendous benefits for the climate as well as for US workers, employers and the economy,” said the Department of Energy (DoE). It concluded in a study that US production could reach 10 GW in two years, 15 GW in three years, and 25 GW in five years on its path to 50 GW of annual production.
The “Catalyzing American Solar Manufacturing” report explores how the United States can move from its current state of limited production to a full-fledged, economy-powering domestic energy supply chain. 
Currently, the nation has the capacity to produce materials like metallurgical-grade silicon, polysilicon, steel, aluminum, resins, racking, and mountings. However, there are significant gaps in the supply chain. The United States does not currently have domestic solar ingot, wafer or cell manufacturing capacity and only modest capacity to produce solar modules, inverters and trackers, said SEIA. As a result, these segments must be targeted on the path to 50 GW.
The SEIA report said that with the right application of new Inflation Reduction Act incentives, the United States should be on track to meet, or even exceed, the 50 GW goal across all segments of the solar supply chain. 
Domestic manufacturers should focus on building downstream production first and backfilling components with imports while upstream domestic production is built out, said SEIA. While scaling domestic module capacity will take two to three years, it will be three to five years before there is significant domestic manufacturing capacity for ingots, wafers and cells.
SEIA said investments in manufacturing should be timed intelligently and with awareness of demand. As an example, scaling solar ingot and wafer operations before new domestic cell capacity comes online could potentially strand new investments. The importance of domestic raw material supplies, and funding for related environmental impact assessments also cannot be overlooked. For example, building new domestic solar glass capacity will significantly improve the cost competitiveness of US module assembly. 
US manufacturers must create in-demand products, by selling at a competitive price and delivering quality goods. This cost competitiveness will likely only be achieved at large scale, which requires significant upfront investment, said the report. 
Following the Inflation Reduction Act, groundbreakings for large-scale manufacturing facilities will likely commence in 2023. The first new factories supported by these policies will begin production in 2025, or as early as 2024 for trackers, racking and aggressive inverter and module manufacturing investments.
A successful buildout will require a robust US workforce. The report said this will depends upon collaboration between companies, government agencies and higher education institutions, to advance solar-specific technical training and college-to-career programs. Diversity, equity, inclusion and justice should be central to the workforce strategy of the energy transition.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/19/solar-power-plants-with-smart-batteries-its-just-a-matter-of-time/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"AUGUST 19, 2022",Solar power plants with smart batteries: It’s just a matter of time,"At present, solar power plants are dominating the market, with the electricity they generate being used directly by households and the excess energy diverted to the electricity grid. However, due to these solar power plants, electricity grids are becoming increasingly overloaded.
According to the CEO of Energy Networks Australia, Andrew Dillon, “If too much energy is fed back into the grid in the middle of the day, it could cause frequency and voltage disturbances in the system, which could lead to transformers tripping off to protect themselves from being damaged, thereby causing localised blackouts.”
Therefore, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, among other countries, have plans in place to prevent people from transferring excess energy to the electricity grid. It is predicted that other countries will follow suit. As a consequence, those who operate solar power plants are, and will increasing be, wondering what to do with the solar electricity that is produced.
A smart battery is a solution that will help direct the electricity generated by a solar power plant during the day into the battery, to use it in the evening. This concept makes it possible to protect the electricity grid and to expand the use of solar power plants even more quickly.
Smart batteries are currently available on the market in capacities ranging from 1.2kWh to 13.5kWh. It is estimated that they can operate successfully for up to 10 years.
After years of testing, Inion Software has developed different battery management algorithms for a team of scientists, which allow for wider and more efficient use of batteries. In our view, a battery should not only be able to store electricity, but also buy it from the grid or sell it.
The algorithms developed accurately predict the behavior of human electricity consumption, as well as the load of the electricity grid, price of electricity, work of a solar power plant, and the lifetime of a battery. With all the information available to the battery, the best outcome is that the customer will pay less for electricity. Here are five battery management scenarios that the algorithms deal with:
Examples of different scenarios:


The different scenarios described above allow for a wider application of the batteries. This not only makes it possible to further expand the construction of solar power plants, and thus protect the electricity grid, but also to ensure people and businesses are paying even less for electricity. Our tests have shown that a smart battery can reduce electricity prices by up to 25%.
If a battery permits the charging and discharging of energy, it is possible to make practically any battery smart. The most important thing is the algorithm that controls the battery.

The tender, launched by Bahrain's Ministry of Electricity and Water Affairs, is open to both local and international bidders.
Under a 20-year contract, the selected developer will be expected to build, own, operate and maintain solar arrays on rooftops, carpark shades, and electric-vehicle charging stations on land belonging to the Bahrain International Circuit, the University of Bahrain, the Bahrain International Exhibition and Convention Centre, and the Al Dana Amphitheatre.
To qualify for the tender, bidders need to be engaged in the solar business, with a track record of at least 10 grid-tied solar projects. At least five of those installations should be solar carpark projects, the ministry said.
It added that bidders should have commissioned at least 40 MWac of grid-tied solar PV projects in any country throughout the world within the last three years. Bidders can obtain tendering documents and submit proposals through the Bahrain Tender Board website.
“The launch of this tender comes as part of the Kingdom's wider vision to adopt a circular carbon economy, with the aim to bring carbon emissions in Bahrain to net zero by 2060,” said H.E. Yasser bin Ebrahim Humaidan, Bahrain's minister of electricity and water affairs.
Bahrain wants to bring 255 MW of solar generation capacity online by 2025 by using net metering, tenders for large-scale projects, and a renewable energy mandate for new buildings. The kingdom’s renewable energy target envisages 700 MW of solar, wind and energy-from-waste generation capacity by 2030.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Middle Eastern country had just 10 MW of installed PV capacity by the end of 2020.

SolarEdge has announced the North American launch of SolarEdge Home, a home energy management solution that is the “brain” of a solar installation. It brings together solar, batteries, and EV chargers into one solution that empowers homeowners to control their home’s solar usage, energy savings, and carbon-emission outputs.
The DC-optimized energy management system connects the inverter and the battery on the DC side, thus eliminating power conversions that are typical in many battery coupled systems. SolarEdge estimates that this can add up to 10 days of saved energy for every year of use. The DC-optimized system also enables multi-day battery backup, which reduces dependence on the grid.
The system includes:
Homeowners can use the mySolarEdge app to control, schedule, and track their energy usage and savings, which will take into account external factors such as weather events and rising utility rates. The app has a Weather Guard feature that is designed to automatically alert the system when a storm is detected, and the system is triggered to charge the battery before the storm hits.
SolarEdge reports that the system simplifies the installation and commissioning process for installers because the DC-optimized system simplifies design, reduces the need for main panel upgrades, and uses wireless plug-and-play connectivity, eliminating the need to wire communication cables between components.
“SolarEdge Home is designed to meet homeowner needs for larger PV systems, more applications, and seamless control through a single app. For installers, SolarEdge Home helps form higher-value customer relationships while minimizing operation and installation costs,” said Peter Mathews, North America general manager.
Homeowners can also opt to add features and capabilities to the SolarEdge Home ecosystem as their home energy needs evolve and change.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/19/tindo-unveils-410-w-solar-panel-with-20-6-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,OCEANIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 19, 2022",Tindo unveils 410 W solar panel with 20.6% efficiency,"From pv magazine Australia
Tindo Solar, Australia’s only solar panel manufacturer, has released its largest residential rooftop module yet. It said that its 410 W Karra panel has now been certified for sale and STC rebates.
The 410 W Karra panel is made with 108 half-cut monocrystalline cells based on M10 wafers (182 mm). It operates with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and a temperature coefficient of -0.34% per degree Celsius.
The new panel measures 1,731 mm x 1,149 mm x 40 mm and weighs 21.5 kg. It is built with fully tempered glass and is wrapped in a black anodized aluminium alloy frame. It comes with a 25-year product guarantee and a 25-year performance guarantee. End power output is guaranteed to be no less than 80% of the nominal output power.
Tindo Chief Executive Officer Shayne Jaenisch said the 410 W Karra panel had been specifically designed to cater to an increasingly sophisticated rooftop solar market. Tindo said the first order for the panels, which are being manufactured at the company’s headquarters in Adelaide, was from a large corporate buyer.
“Five years ago, Australians wanted solar power on their roofs, and the rebates and feed-in tariffs were designed to drive installations,” he said. “Now, the market is more focused on solar PV with battery, VPPs (virtual power plants), and a power supply with the most efficient and reliable output.”
Jaenisch said the 410 W panel had been tested by TUV SUD Korea. Engineers from the certification body confirmed it produced power at about 21% module efficiency and 23.1% cell efficiency. It recorded a cell-to-module (CTM) loss ratio of just 0.07%. Tindo said the industry average energy efficiency of a solar module is between 17% and 19%, and the average CTM loss is 2% to 3%.
“We should be proud that in Australia we have the engineers and the technical skills to commercially produce one of the highest-performing solar panels in the world, right here in Adelaide,” said Jaenisch. “If Australia is going to lead the world in the energy transition, we have to develop a sovereign capability in renewables.”
Jaenisch said the company had looked to address growing demand for ethically and sustainably produced modules with the new panel coming with an end-of-life recycling guarantee.
“Australians are serious about recycling and forced labor,” he said. “We use a global assurance firm to audit our supply chains for issues such as forced labour, and we have a recycling guarantee so that decommissioned panels are recycled for industrial re-use by Reclaim PV.”

The “Reveal” research project began in July, with a number of big goals. They are focusing on the further development of advanced technologies that can produce aluminum from alumina without carbon dioxide emissions. And they are working on technologies to use the metal as a medium for long-term storage of electricity as heat, which can be extracted and used to heat homes in buildings during winter months.
The EU Horizon Europe funding program and the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) are supporting the project with €3.6 million ($3.7 million). The project will run until 2026.
Reveal’s main focus is the development of technology that can store energy from PV, wind and hydropower for months or even years at low cost. Nine partners from seven different European countries are participating in the project. It builds on ideas and preliminary projects from the SPF Institute for Solar Technology at the OST. The concept is fundamentally different from traditional methods of energy storage such as batteries, hydrogen or synthetic fuels, and uses aluminum metal as a medium for energy storage.
Researchers in Iceland have already shownthat electrical energy from renewable sources can be chemically stored in aluminum without emitting greenhouse gases. The OST team was able to back this up by showing that aluminum can be used to generate heat and electrical energy with great efficiency.
Initial model calculations also showed that storing energy in this way can be significantly cheaper than, for example, with power-to-gas or synthetic fuels. The discharge of the energy stored in the aluminum leads to reaction products. These can be converted to aluminum with new energy. But ultimately, the costs and environmental impact will be decisive for the success and sustainability of the concept, according to the Eastern Swiss University of Applied Sciences.
