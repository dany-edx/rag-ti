To support the explosive growth of green energy, Sungrow plans to increase its local workforce in Europe by 35% in 2021. 
Sungrow has demonstrated its strong position in the utility scale sector, supplying its SG3125HV central inverters to the largest projects in Greece, Germany, and Spain in 2020. The SG3125HV is a highly reliable, containerized 3.125 MW inverter that focuses on grid stability and grid-forming functions through its advanced voltage and frequency ride-through capability. The high-voltage ride-through (HVRT) is up to 1.4 Un nominal voltage. It can also feed reactive power during low-voltage ride-through (LVRT), bringing more reliability to the utility and further reducing grid interconnection risk. 
“Sungrow became the main supplier for all large scale utility projects in Europe in 2020. Together with our localized medium-voltage solution we supplied several lighthouse projects across Europe,” said Stefan Froböse, chief technology officer for Sungrow Europe.
Much of Sungrow’s success comes from its commitment to providing world-class PV inverters to meet the growing demands of green energy. This commitment is reflected by focusing on innovation, with the world’s largest R&D team in the renewable sector. The company has grown exponentially, with Europe becoming its most crucial PV market outside China. 
Sungrow released its high-performance SG125HX string inverter to support ground-mounted utility scale projects and it is compatible with the growing preference for high-wattage bifacial solar modules. With its compact design and a light weight of only 70kg, the latest 125 kW solution aims at fast installation and easy commissioning, and is already available for sale in Europe. 
As per a 2020 report from leading trade body, SolarPower Europe, Spain is the world’s largest market for subsidy-free solar projects and has seen an enormous surge in PV utility scale projects in recent years. 
Sungrow released its most powerful turnkey solution system in 2020, the SG6250HV-MV. The 1500V (DC) turnkey system is integrated with two central inverter units of the latest SG3125HV, packing twice the power in one system. The inverter was strategically designed with a DC/AC ratio of up to 1.8, enabling increased efficiency at lower solar PV systems cost. The SG6250HV-MV was instantly embraced by the Spanish solar market and installed in more than 200 MW of utility scale project capacity scattered around Spain.  
“This plug-and-play turnkey solution is quite convenient for utility projects in Europe, as there is no need to do any additional work at the PV plant, except the connection of DC and medium voltage AC,” said Javier Blanco, technical director of PV at Sungrow Europe. “Almost 6.9 MW, achieved in a 40ft container size can only be possible after huge R&D efforts to increase the power density of our last-generation central inverters.”

Phytonics, a spin-off from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), has launched an anti-reflective film for solar modules after more than seven years of research and development work.
The start-up said it was inspired by the world of plants, more precisely from roses, in developing a film that it claims can improve the performance of a PV module by up to 10%.
The film was made by mimicking the nanostructures that can be found in the outer tissue of the rose petals' epidermis, which are able to couple all incident light into the tissue and to let only the colored light emerge again. They were able to study this structure by using a scanning electron microscope.
The anti-reflective film was developed for various surfaces. “Our film makes it possible to combine the advantages of high-gloss and matt surfaces, namely to achieve intense colors without annoying reflections,” explains co-founder Ruben Hünig.
When it is applied to a solar cell, the film offers a broader absorption spectrum and a higher angle of light-incidence tolerance. Micro and nanostructures were fabricated to recreate the epidermis of the rose petals over a large area.
The film is claimed to suppress the reflection for all wavelengths and angles of incidence of light almost completely. This, according to the manufacturer, makes it far superior to conventional anti-reflective coatings.
The company specified that solar modules are only one possible application as the film can also be used for posters, display boards, traffic signs, pieces of furniture, packaging or facades. “The film gives surfaces of all kinds an anti-reflective coating and gives them a noble, velvety appearance,” it stated.
The anti-reflective film is mechanically flexible and is also suitable for curved surfaces. According to Phytonics, it is dirt-repellent and highly resistant to environmental influences such as UV light, moisture and temperature fluctuations. It is manufactured using an inexpensive roll-to-roll printing process and can be applied to all types of materials using standard lamination processes.

The scientists presented their findings in “A data fusion approach to optimize compositional stability of halide perovskites,” which was recently published in Matter. They described the approach as a physics-constrained sequential learning framework to identify the most stable alloyed organic-inorganic perovskites.
The U.S. researchers said that perovskites include a wide range of materials that differ from each other by the way in which atoms are arranged in their layered crystal lattice. These layers, which are commonly described as A, B, and X, can each consist of different atoms or compounds.
“If you consider even just three elements, the most common ones in perovskites that people sub in and out are on the A site of the perovskite crystal structure,” said researcher Tonio Buonassisi, adding that these elements can be varied by a 1% increase in their relative composition. “The number of steps becomes just preposterous. It becomes very, very large and thus impractical to search through systematically.”
The proposed method, which is based on machine learning, combines data from different sources in a data fusion approach. It uses an automated system to guide the production and testing of a range of perovskite formulations and then combines the results with first-principles physical modeling, to guide the next round of experiments. The scientists repeat this process several times until the results are refined.
Thus far, the group has synthesized and tested around 2% of the possible combinations among three components. The scientists claim they have already identified the most durable formulation for perovskite solar cell materials to date. With this material, they also fabricated a small chip and placed it into an existing solar cell, and discovered that it can ramp up the device's stability by more than three times, without compromising its power conversion efficiency.
“Another point of this work is that we actually demonstrate, all the way from the chemical selection until we actually make a solar cell in the end,” said researcher Shijing Sun. “And it tells us that the machine-learning-suggested chemical is not only stable in its own freestanding form. They can also be translated into real-life solar cells, and they lead to improved reliability.”

Elizabeth Minchew, associate operations officer and consultant for the International Finance Corp (IFC), private-sector arm of the World Bank was participating in a two-day green hydrogen conference staged by trade bodies the Africa Solar Industry Association and the African Hydrogen Partnership.
With Morocco and South Africa among the African nations conducting a technical and economic assessment of hydrogen production, Minchew said: “If we're to look for an investment in green hydrogen in Africa, we will want to speak to people who have already taken that preliminary risk assessment and feasibility studies.
“When screening hydrogen investments, we check if [a hydrogen strategy] is cross-sectoral, i.e., does it really incorporate a variety of off-takers and industry players.” If the answer is yes, she said, off-taker risk is mitigated.
Investors will also consider how much renewables generation capacity is in place which could power hydrogen electrolysis, said Minchew.
“When we think about green hydrogen, we always think about solar,” she said. “If the renewable capacity is already built out, obviously that'll be more ideal. However, we're doing some analysis on offshore wind, for example; the technical potential is pretty immense across the region. So we're trying to take a similar approach with scaling wind, then we can maximize the resources and build this whole [hydrogen] ecosystem.”
Pipeline infrastructure and government subsidies would also be required if Africa is to export green hydrogen, said Damien Ricordeau, CEO of renewables financial advisory Finergreen.
“If you want to hit the €1.5-per-kilogram price range, you will not make it with tanks and ship vessels,” he said. “It will be too expensive so the only way is to have a pipeline. If you have an existing pipeline of gas, that's okay, but you'll need to build others as well.”
Building such infrastructure can take 5-10 years, according to the Finergreen founder, who said public subsidy would be required to squeeze out a profit from sustainable hydrogen sold for €1.50/kg.
The expectation among panelists was that nations which have gas pipelines already, such as Morocco, could enjoy a head start in the transition to hydrogen.
Economics and safety are the paramount concerns to consider when planning a hydrogen economy, according to Chakradhar Byreddy, renewables director at the Asia-Pacific division of U.S.-based certification company UL.
Significant cost factors include the generation expense of renewable power and electrolyzer efficiency and capital expenditure (capex) cost, said Byreddy.
He added: “Regarding certification, we look at the economics and safety of the project. For instance, which countries have got the potential to supply 24/7 power to these electrolyzers, and what does it take to have 24/7 micro-grids running on [their] own?”
On electrolyzer development, Byreddy said: “There are lots of new technologies coming up. Currently, hydrogen is where solar was back in 2008.” The hope is that, as with solar, technological developments and economies of scale will drive down cost and ramp efficiency.
On infrastructure, the UL representative said regulatory bodies are currently focusing on where hydrogen production will be established rather than how it will be transported.
The trick for Africa will be harnessing the plentiful solar and wind resources available–with the help of energy storage–and using data-driven analysis of hydrogen production capex costs to be competitive on the global stage, said Byreddy.
“Africa is still not up to the power from where we stand,” he added. “If you look at the bids in the Middle East, or bids in India or South East Asia, the cost of energy and tariffs is low. So they're so competitive in terms of the cost.”
The renewables director said his organization is trying to help policymakers get to grips with hydrogen economics, adding: “We are working with the governments of Australia, India, and the U.S., mapping down all the key concerns and educating more on that. We have also developed a tool that companies and organizations can download, [which enables them to] input the cost parameters and understand how their cost structure looks.”
If nations want to pursue a blue hydrogen industry–using hydrogen generated by the burning of natural gas, for example to produce ammonia fertilizers–securing plenty of demand will again be a big factor, according to Byreddy.
He said: “If you are going to use these projects for fertilizer production, it's good to have, but is it bankable? By ensuring strong off-taker utilities and contractual agreements, companies can help drive down cost and even spread the risk to 15 or 20 years. However, how are we going to do it in the blue hydrogen economy? That should be the concern.”

“OCIMSB’s SoG Poly-Si production capacity is 30,000 MT/year, and it will be expanded to 35,000 MT/year by the second half of 2022,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
OCIM will invest around $55 million in the Malaysian plant, which resumed manufacturing in mid-July. The group raised the plant's capacity from 10,000 MT to 27,000 MT between 2018 and 2019.
With the new capacity additions, the group's total annual polysilicon output – including its 3,000-MT factory in Gunsan, South Korea – will reach 38,000 MT.
“The Malaysian plant is currently in full operation, and the maintenance schedule has not been decided as of now,” the spokesperson said. “The Korean plant is currently not fully operational, and is scheduled to be fully operational from next year.”
The company shut down the Gunsan plant in February 2020, due to downward price pressure in the South Korean polysilicon industry. However, polysilicon prices are now much higher, and PV demand remains strong, the company noted.

However, a study of the renewables-readiness of the country carried out by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) pointed to the huge swings in output from hydro in recent years as droughts struck, illustrating the nation's exposure to climate change.
The IRENA report suggests accelerated deployment of solar and wind power could not only reduce the volume of costly fossil fuel imports which are widening Albania's trade deficit but also make it more resilient to changing weather patterns. Solar, pointed out IRENA, generates peak output at times of the year when Albanian domestic electricity demand is highest, thanks to the cooling requirements of summer, and during months when hydropower generation retreats.
With the nation having fallen far short of the National Renewable Energy Action Plan target of hitting 490 MW of solar capacity last year–envisioned as part of a 738 MW new-renewables portfolio–IRENA has suggested the country should pitch for 1,074 MW of solar this decade, given its technical capacity of hosting 2,378 MW.
Achieving that goal, which IRENA suggested should be at the heart of the nation's new National Energy and Climate Plan for presentation at this year's COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow, would entail various measures, including an immediate €40-80 million investment in the country's dated electricity transmission network.
Enabling the grid to transmit electricity bidirectionally–especially around the chief population centers of Tirana and Durrës–would be only half the battle as far as ramping up rooftop solar is concerned, IRENA said, as the country also needs many more PV installers, as well as the energy auditors needed to estimate building consumption as a legal precursor to net-metered solar arrays being approved.
The authorities in Tirana should also map national solar and wind power resources to identify optimal renewable energy zones, according to IRENA, as well as developing an energy masterplan and a clean power incentive regime, and establishing a government department for renewable energy.
IRENA's report, which cited pv magazine‘s coverage of Albania's solar market, states the nation had 10 MW of solar generation capacity at the end of 2019 with 24 MW worth of up-to-2 MW arrays approved for installation. A first national solar auction, held in November 2018, secured 100 MW of capacity; a second round, in January 2020, procured 140 MW; and the results of an auction for 100 MW of solar at Durrës, held in November, were reported by pv magazine on Thursday.
IRENA highlighted the €0.02489/kWh French renewables company Voltalia agreed for the solar power generated by its winning bid in January 2020, although the same company bid €0.029/kWh in the latest procurement round.

Researchers from the Queensland University of Technology have made a remarkable breakthrough with the development of an electrochemical process in which carbon dioxide is captured from the air and stored in water as a non-toxic calcium carbonate (chalk) in a renewably powered process that could also produce green hydrogen and decarbonize the cement industry. 
PhD researcher Olawale Oloye and Professor Anthony O’Mullane from the QUT Centre for Clean Energy Technologies and Practices developed the process of capturing and converting carbon dioxide through a mineralization approach that seems to produce a host of serendipitous by-products. 
 
According to O’Mullane, the “process involves the capture of CO2 by its reaction with an alkaline solution produced on demand, to form solid carbonate products which can be used, for example, as construction materials, thereby keeping carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. This can be done using a simple calcium source in water.”
It is also important to note that the QUT researchers used seawater instead of potable water, as potable water is too precious a resource for large-scale carbon capture, especially in Australia.
“We found we could use seawater once it had been treated to remove sulphates. To do this we first precipitated calcium sulphate or gypsum, another building material, and then carried out the same process to successfully turn CO2 into calcium carbonate, thus providing proof of concept of a circular carbon economy,” O’Mullane said. “Next, the hydrogen evolution reaction during electrolysis ensured that the electrode was continually renewed to keep the electrochemical reaction going while also generating another valuable product, green hydrogen. This means if this electrolysis process is powered by renewable electricity, we are producing green hydrogen alongside the calcium carbonate (CaCO3).” 
The process captures and stores carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, while also generating a green fuel source capable of decarbonizing pesky industrial sectors such as heavy transport, manufacturing, and the entire energy sector of export partners like Japan. 
O’Mullane said the use of renewable energy to capture CO2 and create calcium carbonate may be needed in the cement industry, which is one of the tougher industries to decarbonize.
“We envision this technology would benefit emission-intensive industries such as the cement industry whose CO2 footprint is 7-10% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions,” said O’Mullane. “By coupling the mineralization process to produce CaCO3 from the emitted CO2 during the clinking step we could create a closed loop system and reduce a significant percentage of the CO2 involved in cement production.”
The scientists described their findings in “Electrochemical Capture and Storage of CO2 as Calcium Carbonate,” which was recently published in ChemSusChem.

India's cumulative rooftop solar capacity stood at 3.9 GW as of Feb. 28, versus a 40 GW target by 2022, according to the latest data shared by the Ministry of Power.
The nation's rooftop PV installations account for only 10% of the nation’s 39.1 GW of grid-connected solar capacity.
With 942 MW capacity, the state of Gujarat leads the nation in rooftop solar installations, followed by Maharashtra (694 MW) and Rajasthan (419 MW). No rooftop solar capacity has been installed in Lakshadweep or Ladakh, the figures show.
The need to approach multiple agencies was identified as one of the main factors deterring customers from installing rooftop solar under the first phase of the country's rooftop solar program. To simplify this process, the government has made power distribution companies (discoms) and their local offices as the nodal points for implementing the program’s second phase.
The second phase is targeting an aggregate 4 GW of grid-connected rooftop solar in the residential sector by providing central financial assistance. Discoms are given incentives based on their track record of installing additional grid-connected rooftop PV capacity over and above the base level. However, these incentives are limited to the first additional 18 GW of rooftop capacity installed across the country.
