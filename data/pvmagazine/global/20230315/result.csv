This is how the Commission's proposal for the long-awaited reform of the European Union's single electricity market can be summarized.
Since the autumn of 2021, and particularly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, energy prices have surged. Despite a considerable share of renewable energy generation in some price zones, electricity price spikes are linked to the cost of fossil-fuel generation. To protect end consumers and industry from such prices, EU member states have had to provide unprecedented support.
In response, negotiations have been underway within the EU to redesign the internal energy market. Member states agreed that short-lived price fluctuations on the fossil-fuel markets should no longer have such a catastrophic impact on consumer electricity prices. While Spain urged substantial changes, countries such as Germany and the Netherlands warned: “Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.” Excessive cuts in the market mechanism could cloud the investment climate in renewable energies and thus cause expansion to stall.
In the run-up to the proposal, member states disagreed on how far the revision of the electricity market design should go. In the future, electricity suppliers could hedge against volatile markets through long-term PPAs.
The European Commission's (the Commission) proposal represents a compromise and envisages revising the Electricity Directive, the Electricity Regulation, and the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT).
Stabilizing prices
The primary objective of the revision of the internal energy market is to stabilize prices. The merit order mechanism received a lot of attention in the wake of last year's price increases. The Commission cannot completely abolish it because the mechanism is not prescribed by law, but is a way for homogeneous goods such as electricity to function in markets.
However, in its proposal the Commission agreed that renewable energies receiving state subsidies must be capped by a two-way contract for difference (CfD). In current European subsidy regimes, the price is only capped at the floor for the producer; in the other direction the sky is the limit. In a two-sided CfD, the legislator would also set a price cap (ceiling). In this way, any excess profits from electricity trading would be passed on to households.
Consultation process for contracts for difference
In the run-up to the draft, consultation with the energy industry found that 70% of the participants considered two-sided CfDs to be an effective means of stabilizing electricity prices.
Another proposal seeks to improve market conditions for long-term PPAs. Electricity suppliers should purchase a larger share of their electricity via long-term contracts – also known as hedging. Doing so means electricity suppliers would not run the risk of passing on high prices directly to customers or claiming state aid in the event of renewed market fluctuations. Electricity suppliers would be required to secure long-term PPAs for renewable or non-fossil generation as part of their power volumes generated by the fixed contracts.
At present, there are still weaknesses in the PPA market, according to the Commission. These lie primarily in the credit risks of the buyers. Therefore, member states should be obliged to ensure market-based liabilities and guarantees for PPAs. This would also lead to secured revenues for the producers and improve the investment climate for renewable energies.
More consumer protection
The energy market reform also aims to ensure greater transparency, integrity, and consumer protection. For example, member states will be able to define vulnerable consumers who can benefit from regulated electricity prices in the event of a crisis. However, this is to include only households and medium-sized companies. There are to be no regulated, preferential electricity prices for industry.
The Commission's proposal also puts the onus on the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators and national regulators to better monitor the transparent pricing and integrity of competitive markets. The REMIT adjustment in particular is intended to improve the data quality of monitoring and prevent market abuse.
Collective self-consumption and tenant electricity
In addition to stable prices, the reform of the electricity market design is also intended to lead to more electricity generation from renewable energy sources. Therefore, the new market design should enable investments in wind and solar farms by end customers – simplifying the path to citizen energy projects. In addition, the Commission proposes to make possible the uncomplicated sharing of surplus electricity from rooftop PV systems with immediate neighbors.
This form of collective self-consumption is already partially possible in some member states. However, there is no uniform EU-wide regulation. In some parts of the internal market it's completely prohibited, which should now change. The aim is also to give end customers without a private roof the opportunity to protect themselves from high electricity prices by investing in renewable energy systems.
A transparency obligation for trading periods and grid bottlenecks on the part of the grid operators should further facilitate the feed-in of renewable energies.
Enabling flexibility
Another proposal to stabilize prices is to promote system flexibility and storage capacity. For example, all end users are to be given access to dynamic electricity prices in order to operate electric cars and heat pumps more cost-effectively. Member states will also be required to formulate their needs and targets for storage and non-fossil flexibility capacity.
New frameworks for storage and load control are to be considered in future tenders and support guidelines.
The Commission's proposal remains to be confirmed by the European Council and Parliament.

France’s Nouvelle-Aquitaine region has announced aid to support the growth of solar PPAs. The recently opened call for projects aims to promote affordable local energy supplies to the region's industrial companies, particularly in the form of new solar plants.
Companies will be eligible for two types of aid: a subsidy for technical and legal feasibility studies (to a maximum of 70% of costs), or funding assistance in the form of a loan or guarantee as part of the support provided by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) on its 2021-27 plan.
In the latter scenario, projects may also benefit from an ERDF subsidy “depending on the size of the beneficiary company and the cost of [electricity per] MWh … The amount of the subsidy paid to the investor of the solar power plant must be fully passed on to the industrial company via a discount on the price of electricity supplied.”
In all cases, subsidies will be paid directly to the solar project owner. In addition, the awarded companies will be supported in choosing the type and tariff of the PPA.
The call for projects is open until Dec. 31, 2023, to companies whose electricity consumption at the production site or sites located in Nouvelle-Aquitaine is greater than 5 GWh/year. They can apply alone or in groups, or as part of a multi-buyer PPA.
“Large groups may be supported, but only in the context of a collective green corporate PPA with small businesses in Nouvelle-Aquitaine,” the regional government said in a statement.

Austria-based Alternative Energy Projects (AEP) has unveiled its first complete mobile power plant. The “Solar-Box” is a 20-foot container with solar modules, an electricity storage unit, and a hydrogen storage system.
The solution increases solar self-consumption and reportedly works both on-grid and off-grid. AEP Managing Director Gerald Wirtl told pv magazine that the system is available for direct purchase, or via its sales partners in different equipment variants.
“In terms of price, the container is priced at around €125,000 ($133,507)  for purchase from our warehouse in Linz,” said Wirtl.
The output of the container solution starts at 94 kW and can be scaled up to large systems of more than 5 MW, Wirtl said. Each container module can reportedly be transported to the desired location by common means of transport such as truck, ship, or train.
Each container has 168 solar modules, each with 560 W of power, as well as an inverter with 100 kVA and a completely pre-wired AC cabinet. The containers weigh 12.5 tons.
It purportedly takes between 30 to 45 minutes to unfold and assemble the PV plant. The tilt angle of the modules is 15 degrees and all orientations are possible. With four workers, the plug-and-play system could be installed in three hours, says AEP.
Connection is possible to low and medium voltage, the company said, noting that the plug-and-play architecture allows the power plant to be easily commissioned at its destination without high connection costs.
AEP describes other advantages of its system as simplified building permits, straightforward assembly of solar modules, corrosion resistance, and compatibility with storage and energy management systems.
The system has broad application potential, ranging from temporary power generation on green spaces to powering remote construction sites and industrial facilities, or providing emission-free power at events.

It attracted a healthy roll call of big manufacturers and local players, with inverter and heat pump producers taking center stage.
The event was held on March 8 and March 9 in Targi Kielce, around 200 kilometers south of Warsaw. It attracted 323 companies from 15 countries and 19,600 visitors, spreading across a surface of 33 096 m2. According to the organizers, it was a record-breaking edition, up from 190 exhibitors and 7868 visitors welcomed in 2022 on a surface of 15 550 square meters.
To the surprise of some exhibitors and attendees, last year’s changes in regulations for the distributed-generation PV segment failed to dampen the enthusiasm on the show’s floor.
Namely, Poland's residential rooftop PV sector underwent a profound change in spring last year when new provisions were introduced for PV “micro-installations” up to 50 kW in size. The new net billing system replaced the net metering scheme that was in force since 2016, jeopardizing what has been the country’s key PV deployment engine.
Mid last year, several important players in the Polish PV sector reported significant financial losses, and some installation companies have even gone bankrupt. Nonetheless, Poland managed to install 4.9 GW of solar PV in 2022, according to Solar Power Europe data, making it the third biggest market in Europe, after Germany and Spain.
“Almost 90% of PV installs in 2022 came from prosumers,” said Bogdan Szymanski, vice president of the Polish PV Association (SBF Polska PV).“This year, things will look a bit different.”
According to Szymanski, the market is expected to remain on the growth trajectory but with a shift from micro-installations to the utility-scale.
“This year, some 50% of new installs will come from prosumers,” he said. “Meanwhile, many 100 MW or 200 MW projects in the pipeline will come to fruition after they have emerged from years-long permitting procedures.”
The C&I PV market segment is also expected to make a considerable contribution to this year’s grand total.
“Last year, we witnessed the awakening of the C&I PV market segment in Poland,” said Maciej Borowiak, vice president of SBF Polska PV and cofounder of PV installation company Brewa. “The electricity prices were five time higher than four-five years ago with an average of PLZ 1,200 ($273)/MW and SMEs started to turn to PV as a shield against electricity price volatility.”
According to Borowiak, two or three years ago, there was no interest coming from the C&I market segment.
“Now, my company is preparing almost every day an offer for 1 MW or 2 MW projects and even up to 5 MW arrays and all these projects are planning a PPA business model,” he adds.
However, while PV system up to 50 kW need no permission, it usually takes around 12 months to get all necessary permits for bigger systems. Another headwind is the current regulation that applies to the PPA market.
“A maximum PPA price of around PLZ 350/MWh was fixed and it will stay effective for a year,” Szymanski said. “In other words, if you sell at a price which is higher than the one set in the auction plus PLZ 50, you need to pay the tax on all the amount earned above this price, and this is putting some investors off.”
While new regulation is expected in the PPA space as well as in regard to permits for construction of direct lines, the industry insiders believe that not much change will materialize this year due to the upcoming parliamentary elections.
Meanwhile, prospects are bright for heat pumps. Last year, Poland was the fastest growing heat pump market in Europe with a 130% sales growth year on year. According to local associations, no such jump is expected this year, but the installation pace will keep the momentum going.
Some of the leading heat pump providers – Panasonic, Mitsubishi Electric, and Daikin – told pv magazine at Enex Expo that they were caught off guard by the rapid rise in demand seen last year but that the current lead times have been reduced to around six months.

The continued decline in costs for solar and battery energy storage systems means off-grid living is far more accessible, and luxurious, than previously thought. Take Stella the Stargazer, for instance. The modern (and mobile) “tiny home” bears all the hallmarks of a spruced-up Aussie shed, with some key differences – including a 3 kW solar battery system and a retractable bed that cantilevers outside the structure so that you can sleep under the stars.
Designed by Ample and funded by Visit Victoria, Stella the Stargazer is a limited edition vacation opportunity, a sort of pop-up vacation home that moves every eight weeks. Stella first took up residence among the rolling hills and vineyards of Maffra, in the Australian state of Victoria.

Built using repurposed timber and steel salvaged from true-blue farming shed, a night under the stars with with all the amenities electricity can provide costs roughly AUD 330 ($220) on weekdays and AUD 390 on weekends.
Perfect for couples, the property comes with everything a cosy getaway requires, but none of the superfluous extras that might otherwise distract from the serenity of going off-grid in beautiful country. Stella comes with a fridge, woodfire stove, cooktop, shower and flushable toilet thanks to a fresh rainwater gal-iron tank and wastewater system.
More the merrier 
As a solar-powered off-grid holiday destination, Stella the Stargazer is by no means unique. Residents of Sydney may remember Lilypad Palm Beach, a floating solar-powered villa that enables lucky guests to enjoy all the luxury of an island getaway with none of the sustainability concerns.
Gawthorne’s Hut is another luxury solar-plus-storage powered off-grid holiday destination within a working farm 10 minutes from the center of Mudgee, New South Wales. The property even won a “Best Unique Stay Australia” award in 2021 from Airbnb.
On the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, eco-accomodation company EyreWay has built two solar-powered, off-grid luxury tiny homes.
Going off-grid used to suggest an element of roughing it, but thanks to solar and battery energy storage going off-grid looks a lot more amenable to those of us who like a bit of luxury in their lives.

The Indian state of Mizoram now hosts a 28 MW (DC) solar plant, despite the challenge of sloping, uneven terrain with narrow strips of land separated by gorges. The plant is shaped like a hand, with 15 solar array fingers connected by a perimeter road and a 33 kV transmission line. 
The solar park is near Vankal, Khawzawl district. It spans 194 acres. The uneven terrain makes it difficult to install solar panels in a way that maximizes their exposure to sunlight. The orientation and angle of the PV modules needed to be adjusted to account for the slope of the terrain. 
“The plant is shaped like a hand palm with 15 fingers connected by a perimeter road and 33kV transmission line for power evacuation to maximize module installation while minimizing shading effectively,” Kamalesh Saraswat, a SAEL engineer, told pv magazine. “Overall, our thoughtful approach to the design of the entire solar power plant should help us achieve optimal energy production and efficiency.”
Via its wholly owned Sunfree North East Renewable Energy subsidiary, SAEL has signed a 25-year power purchase agreement with the power and electricity department of the Mizoram government. SAEL’s in-house EPC team executed the plant installation and commissioning. 
Saraswat said the main challenge was identifying the plant site, so the company could install the module mounting structures and achieve the desired capacity of the plant.
“Our team conducted a contour and drone survey of the entire area to identify the flat area, gorge, and steep valley area and optimize module angle through our latest software and tools,” said Saraswat. “We also followed the natural contour and minimized the steep area to reduce mismatch losses/efficiency of the plant.”
Mizoram experiences high winds and heavy rainfall, which can damage or dislodge solar modules, so the SAEL team provided additional structural support to ensure that the panels remained securely in place. The module mounting structure differs from conventional flat-terrain solar power plants. The plant feature high-efficiency mono-PERC modules and string inverters.

Illuminate USA says that the construction of the facility will generate 150 jobs. Once it is up and running, it will require 850 individuals to keep it going. The factory will make single and bifacial solar modules.
Invenergy’s involvement with solar panel manufacturing follows an emerging pattern in the US market.
According to the Solar Energy Industries of America “Solar & Storage Supply Chain Dashboard,” the total US solar module assembly fleet is above 58 GW. That figure includes proposed facilities, as well as facilities being constructed or expanded, and includes the capacity from Longi.

The FDIC put Silicon Valley Bank into receivership last week and created a new bank – Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara – with available account deposits of up to $250,000. On the weekend, the US Federal Reserve said that all deposits would be secured and available to depositors on Monday morning.
Silicon Valley Bank’s $209 billion in assets make its collapse the second-largest bank failure in US history. The bank’s challenges, some of which were known, accelerated when it announced the sale of $21 billion of assets at a 9% loss, in order to make sure it could still cover all assets.
This prompted multiple business groups to quickly withdraw $42 billion in assets, including Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund. A second bank, Signature Bank in New York, has also collapsed. It was also being managed by the Fed in a similar manner as Silicon Valley Bank.
Silicon Valley Bank’s website stated that it had a hand in financing 62% of community solar projects as of March 31, 2022. A Google search verifies a definite relationship.

pv magazine USA has reached out to multiple community solar involved companies to get their reactions to these events. Over the weekend, publicly traded residential solar companies such as Sunrun and Sunnova Energy issued statements on Silicon Valley Bank’s failure.
Sunrun said Silicon Valley Bank was a lender on two of its credit facilities, but claimed that it accounted for less than 15% of its total hedging facilities. Sunrun said does not anticipate significant exposure. It does hold cash deposits with Silicon Valley Bank totaling nearly $80 million, but the Fed has stated that these are protected.
Sunnova said its exposure to Silicon Valley Bank is negligible because it does not hold cash deposits or securities with the financial group. However, one of its subsidiaries is part of a credit facility where SVB serves as a lender.
Stem, an energy storage development company, said it estimates less than 5% of cash deposits and short-term investments could be affected by Silicon Valley Bank’s closure, but the company does not hold any credit facilities with the bank. Sunrun’s stock lost 12.4% in value since SVB’s collapse late last week, while Sunnova and Stem were down 11.4% and 10.4% respectively.

With the maturation of the off-grid and edge-of-grid power market, investors have also become more savvy. Thus, it is critical to understand how to plan a project that meets the needs of the asset owner, the end users and all other stakeholders. While the type of analysis typically focuses primarily on project economics, it is important to consider social, behavioral and environmental factors as well.
A report developed by IEA PVPS Task 18, aims to provide guidance to stakeholders who are involved in the design and development of off-grid photovoltaic (PV) projects by providing a comprehensive guide to feasibility studies. It is intended to be used as a reference tool during the early stages of planning and decision-making processes for such projects.
All feasibility studies are different; every project develops in a unique context that consists of different locations, stakeholders, site conditions, aims, constraints, and opportunities. Unfortunately, there have been many examples of well-meaning but poorly considered projects that have partially or wholly failed to deliver on their promise and/or potential. The reasons for these failures are many and varied but, in many cases, can be attributed to mistakes and misunderstandings in the initial feasibility phase of the project.
According to the Task 18 report, the key steps involved in conducting a feasibility study are:
· Identification of project objectives: This section provides guidance on how to engage with project stakeholders to ascertain the desirable outcomes of the project. These outcomes may be financial, social and/or environmental.
· Site Selection and Resource Assessment: This section provides guidance on how to select a suitable site for an off-grid PV project and how to assess its solar resource potential. It highlights the importance of accurate weather data and solar radiation measurements, and provides guidance on how to conduct on-site measurements.
· System Design: This section provides guidance on how to design an off-grid PV system that meets the project's objectives and site constraints. It covers key design considerations such as system sizing, component selection, and system reliability.
· Financial Analysis: This section provides guidance on how to conduct a financial analysis of an off-grid PV project, including cost-benefit analysis, cash flow analysis, and project financing options.
A case study is presented in the report from a remote indigenous-owned and operated cattle station located 10 km from the grid in Australia’s Northern Territory (NT). This cattle station is powered by a diesel generation system. The client in this case study required a feasibility assessment to decide whether to continue powering the site business as usual (BAU), connect to the grid, or upgrade the power system to a PV / BESS / Diesel Hybrid. Furthermore, if the feasibility study indicates it is beneficial to install a standalone hybrid power station, the Client will need to know how different system designs (i.e. smaller vs. larger systems) will impact the economic, social and environmental project outcomes.
The client wishes to:
· Maximise financial returns
· Improve power system reliability
· Minimise operational cost volatility
· Improve environmental sustainability
Using these design criteria, the case study seeks to understand whether the client should remain BAU, connect to the grid or develop a PV / BESS / Diesel Hybrid system. The case study goes on to develop a full load and supply profile analysis and assigns the appropriate capital expenditure (Capex) and operational expenditure (Opex) to each option.
The output metrics can then be viewed in various ways in order to demonstrate to the client the trade-offs that can be made between the identified design criteria. The feasibility study (and thus the case study) utilize contour (aka topological) graphs for multivariant analysis. For example, if the client wished to optimize based on Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) by varying the BESS size and the PV System size, the following graph demonstrates these relationships.

Where the black-dotted contour lines represent negative NPV, the black-solid contour lines represent positive NPV and the red contour lines represent IRR. Given this multivariant analysis, the optimization can be placed where NPV and IRR are greatest and this is shown using the blue dot.
The above optimization is purely financial, however, if the client wished to view an environmental metric as the Renewable Energy Fraction (REF) which represents the amount of energy supplied from a renewable source as a percentage of total energy supply, versus a financial metric such as NPV, the following contour graph could be used.

It can be seen that selecting a different optimization criterion will change the desired BESS and Solar PV system sizes.
The IEA PVPS Task 18 report shows how stakeholder engagement and multivariant, multi-criteria optimization can be used to find the best outcomes for the project. Overall, the report provides a comprehensive guide to conducting feasibility studies for off-grid PV projects, providing stakeholders with the tools and information necessary to make informed decisions throughout the planning and development process.

“This product is developed and produced internally,” a spokesperson for the Chinese inverter manufacturer told pv magazine. “We added BIPV products into our product catalog to make us a more comprehensive one-stop solution provider.”
The Galaxy panel line has a power output of 315 W and a power conversion efficiency of 17.4%. The open-circuit voltage is between 30.53 V and the short-circuit current is 12.90 A. The panels measure 2,319 mm × 777 mm × 4 mm, weigh 11 kg, and have a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius.
The operating ambient temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C, said the manufacturer, and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The panel has 1.6 mm of ultra-thin glass.
“This glass not only improves the product’s ability to resist strong impact from hail or high winds, but also brings durability and safety to buildings with all-weather protection,” GoodWe said in a statement.
GoodWe offers a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee. It said the panels are able to operate at 82% of their original performance after 25 years and at 80% after 30 years.
“Currently, we plan to sell it in the European and Australian markets, and other international and regional markets will follow suit” said the spokesperson.
*The article was amended on March 17 to reflect that the module's output is 315 W and not 375 W, as we previously reported.
