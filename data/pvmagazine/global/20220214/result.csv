“After being put into operation, 200,000kWh of clean electricity can be stored on a single charge, equivalent to the consumption of about 1,000 households in a month,” the manufacturer said in a statement. 
The project is relying on Sineng's 3.15MW turnkey battery stations EH-3150-HA-UD 35, which feature a 1500V system integration design. These batteries have a maximum efficiency of 98.08%, measure 6058×2896×2438mm, and weigh in at 15,000 kg including the oil transformer.
Their converter is designed with two sets of battery interfaces, which can independently perform charge and discharge management, ensuring the system is more reliable and safer, the company said. The storage system is also equipped with smart forced air cooling, which can ensure the system operates without derating under temperatures of 50 degrees Celsius.
The project is owned by China Three Gorges Renewables (Group) Co., the renewable energy arm of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG), and is the first phase of a 300MW/600MWh that the Chinese state-owned power company is building in in Qingyun County.

The South Asian nation is drawing up a new, post-coal Integrated Energy and Power Master Plan, with financial assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).
Cleveland, Ohio-based IEEFA has published a report which says it is high time Bangladesh turned its back on planned LNG, as well as coal-fired power plants, and reset its planning regime to establish a new, financially sustainable power system.

Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.

In the IEEFA report, energy finance analyst Simon Nicholas called upon masterplan financiers JICA to focus on grid investment and renewables to improve grid electricity reliability and limit the nation’s dependence on expensive, imported fossil fuels.
Such a move would lessen the likelihood of electricity prices rising, according to Nicholas, who wrote: “Building domestic, low cost clean energy [generation] capacity would help improve the eroding financial status of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), which is burdened by the country’s capacity over-expansion, based on imported fossil fuels.”
State-owned utility the BPDB last month proposed a bulk power tariff increase of up to 64% to make up a BDT325 billion ($3.8 billion) shortfall in its accounts. “[The] BPDB is sinking under the increasing cost of power generation and purchase based on imported coal, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and oil,” wrote Nicholas.
In the last fiscal year, a record high government subsidy was required to cover the BPDB’s operating losses, which doubled from the previous 12-month period. Power tariffs could rise even further, the IEEFA study pointed out, if the new power masterplan continues to focus on imported fossil fuels.
The U.S.-based thinktank pointed out the BPDB is financially hamstrung by the fact it has too much power generation capacity and is committed to making power generation capacity payments to underused power plants, with the capacity payments bill rising to BDT132 billion ($1.5 billion) in the last fiscal year.
The largest single contribution to that account was associated with the Payra coal-fired power plant, half of which stands idle, according to IEEFA, because of insufficient power transmission facilities.
“With more IPPs [independent power producers] due to come online – and more coal and LNG plants being planned – BPDB’s operating losses can be expected to worsen, going forward,” wrote Nicholas.
The nation was also forced to pay record high LNG prices last year as the cost of the fuel rocketed worldwide. With analysts not expecting a reduction in gas price volatility any time soon, Nicholas wrote: “Becoming increasingly dependent on imported fuels such as LNG will result in larger government subsidies to bail out the BPDB’s losses, and large power and gas tariff increases for Bangladesh energy consumers.”
The alternative, wrote the analyst, would be for the power masterplan to focus on the raised clean energy ambition of state body the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority and the goals enshrined in the national Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan, named after the nation's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
“If Bangladesh wishes to start enjoying the benefits of low-cost renewable energy, as much of the rest of the world is doing, the government’s ambitious wind and solar targets need to be locked into the new IEPMP [Integrated Energy and Power Master Plan],” he added.

Borosil Renewables will expand its solar panel glass manufacturing capacity from 450 tons per day to 2,000 as it continues to see strong growth in demand. The company is adding a third solar line with a capacity of 550 metric tons which is expected to start production by September and will enhance the manufacturer’s daily production capacity to 1,000 tons. 
Another doubling in capacity, through the addition of two more solar glass lines, has already been approved by the company’s board. Of those, one is expected to come on stream in the third quarter of next year. 
Thinner glass – 2mm, 2.5mm, and 2.8mm – occupies almost 30% of Borosil's production capacity at present and the company expects its 2mm products to account for at least a similar slice of its expanded capacity, based on rising demand for bifacial solar panels.
In this month’s edition, pv magazine takes a deep dive into the world of electromobility, with 22 pages of analysis taking in the market growth and expectations for electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide; how electricity networks will need to grow and adapt to make room for the electrification of transport; and the vital role for solar in all of this. We examine the growing trend for residential and commercial EV chargers linked to PV and optimized to make the most of solar kilowatt-hours, and take a look at some of the early movers working on vehicle-integrated PV – from solar sunroofs to full integration in vehicle bodywork. We also consider a range of e-mobility applications, from commercial trucks to family cars to electric bikes and other “last mile” delivery vehicles.
Borosil recorded net sales of INR169 crore ($22.3 million) in the October-to-December quarter, up 20% on the figures posted a year earlier. Exports, including to customers in special economic zones, stood at INR44.6 crore ($5.89 million) to account for 26.5% of quarterly turnover. The glassmaker banked net profits of INR45.7 crore for the three-month window.
That meant net sales for the nine months of the fiscal year to the end of December came in at INR465 crore, up 51% on the same period of fiscal year 2021.
The manufacturer has said it expects domestic demand to be driven by the big volumes of solar capacity which are being commissioned by government policies.
Presenting the company’s report card for the third quarter of the fiscal year, Borosil executive chairman PK Kheruka said: “The government has announced three major steps underlining its commitment to the establishment of a strong domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem. The first is the announcement of an additional allocation of INR19,500 crore ($2.58 billion) under the PLI [production-linked incentive] scheme [to incentivize manufacturing capacity for] solar cells and modules, raising the total allocation to a very impressive INR24,000 crore ($3.17 billion). The second is the formal announcement of basic customs duty on solar panels at 40%, and on solar cells at 25%, effective from April 1, 2022. The third is the scheme of the approved list of models and manufacturers introduced some months ago, whereby effectively only Indian manufacturers of solar modules are able to supply to many types of government tenders, which have now been extended to open access and net metering projects as well. As a result, we are expecting that large incremental capacities, already announced, will now be implemented.”
“Even though 14GW of solar module manufacturing capacity exists in India, actual production was about 5.5GW during the financial year 2021. We see installed capacity rising to 50GW of solar panels within the next three years. This will give a great boost to the domestic production of solar equipment in India, causing a major shift away from imports from China to sourcing from domestic manufacturers. Consequently, we expect increased demand for solar glass in India.” 
Kheruka said Borosil is in advanced discussions with many domestic manufacturers seeking Indian-made solar glass. The manufacturer is also anticipating attractive future growth in exports on the back of an expected rise in the production of solar modules in major markets such as Europe and the USA.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/14/high-reliability-600w-pv-modules-point-the-solar-industry-in-a-new-direction/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"FEBRUARY 14, 2022",High reliability 600W+ PV modules point the solar industry in a new direction,"Dr. Zhang Yingbin, Trina Solar’s head of product strategy and marketing: The bankability index granted by BNEF can be shown to finance institutes when it comes to securing finance for solar projects. In general, it shows the creditability of the product and the company. There are several key points that need to be checked for the bankability evaluation. First is the financial status of the company. The second is its reliability, including the specifications and product warranties for our PV panels. And then there is the adaptation to other components, ease of installation, and added value for customers.
The 100% classification means every person Bloomberg NEF interviewed gave a 100% positive reply to questions on our PV products, brand, customer service, and financial status. We are proud to say that it’s really a great achievement to win 100% bankability six times.
Yes, we are also in the process of having our 210 mm-based large-format modules evaluated by PVEL and the Renewable Energy Test Center (RETC). From the initial results, we have seen very good scores for mechanical load, thermal cycles, PID, cracks, etc.
What I want to emphasize is that these product evaluations contain multiple levels. First, our R&D team conducted internal evaluations during the process of prototype design according to IEC standards. Then we sent our modules to authoritative testing organizations like TÜV Rheinland for a more comprehensive evaluation and to receive certifications from IEC and/or UL. We completed this around Q1 2021. The third step was to go to PVEL and RETC, which are authoritative and recognized by the financial markets, to pass their enhanced tests – three times or even higher than normal IEC standards.
As our best quality product, with enhanced warranty conditions, many of our customers have been very accepting of our 210mm modules. So far, we have shipped over 16GW of these products. Of course, there are some customers who are still on the sidelines and they need time to appreciate the benefits of these new sizes; but, I believe it won’t take long.
What has exceeded our expectations is the fact that the new 210 mm-based panels are not only popular in the utility-scale PV segment, but they are also being adopted for other types of PV. For example, we have shipped them to Singapore for floating PV projects, to the Netherlands for use in agrivoltaic projects in rural areas, and for many C&I distributed PV on rooftops of factory buildings. This is due to our wide power portfolios, with our 210 mm-based modules ranging from 410W to 670W.
The integrated delivery solution is a unique innovation by Trina for our customers. From the perspective of the installer, we take every aspect of the entire shipping process into consideration and provide a solution, guidelines, and instructions for them to better utilize each module. For example, most conventional PV manufacturers only care about the sales of their PV modules. We are involved, however, in their packaging, uploading onto containers, shipping via ocean or land, their inventory and transition, their unpacking and transportation to the site, and their final installation on supports or trackers, etc. The entire process is formalized with a white paper and corresponding video so that our customers can follow and proceed with the highest efficiency and accuracy to save costs, reduce damage, and increase profits.
First, I want to say that Trina Solar is very confident about our products, and we would not launch any that were immature or defective. In terms of why the mechanical load of 210mm format modules is not an issue, I provide the following explanation: Trina Solar has utilized a series of technologies on the new panels to improve their mechanical specifications. For example, we use non-destructive cutting to reduce hidden cracks and improve the mechanical load of the solar cells. And we use strengthened frameworks on the panel which has improved mechanical strength. We have further increased the thickness of side C from 1.4mm to 1.65mm. And we have provided improved solutions for screws and shims for connection points. Based on our calculations, we have improved the total mechanical load by at least 27% with just a 20% area increase.
This is what I want to emphasize: we improved the mechanical load capacity with our technical injections. Steel is much heavier than wood, but ships made of steel can carry much more than those made of wood.
This is due to Trina’s belief in cooperation with partners. The 210 mm-based large-format PV modules generate bigger currents which inverters need to support. The inverter white papers tell our customers that there are over 200 inverters from 21 manufacturers (covering 90% of inverter brands) that are ready to support the new PV modules. The same goes for trackers. Our tracker white papers list over 30 trackers from 14 major manufacturers around the world that can support our 210mm panels. We also have a service on our website for customers which shows them which inverters and trackers are compatible with our different modules. That’s a powerful tool for our customers to make the right selection.
We believe both technologies are very promising, and Trina Solar has invested in technical research for both. When will either of them go into mass production, on a GW scale? I believe this depends on investment and processing costs. The general cost level determines the timelines for mass production. When the cost level begins to compete with current products or go even lower, the breakthrough point will come. Trina is well prepared for the future and is just waiting for the signal.
Our 2022 product lineup comprises our 210 Vertex modules, and the latest N-type modules. We will also keep optimizing products to bring more value to the market.

Todd Li, President of Trina Solar Asia Pacific: We have been promoting our products in Asia-Pacific since their global launch. The 600W+ module was introduced to the market in July of 2020, and the 670W+ was launched in March 2021. Because local product certification requirements vary in different countries, actual shipments occurred late, however.
The acceptance of our super-high power modules has been very high, accounting for around 80% of our total shipments in Q3 2021. Among them, the majority of the orders were for the newly launched ultra-high power Vertex 600 W+ series of modules.
I think there are two reasons. First, the new ultra-high power module has a lower levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). Secondly, they can produce more electricity within the same area of landscape. Because the ultra-high power module creates more value for customers, it has eventually brought more success to us.
When customers bought these products for the first time, some of them might have had concerns about shipments and installation due to their bigger size and weight. Trina Solar did a lot of work to improve the shipment and logistics processes, as Dr. Zhang Yingbin explained. The feedback we have received indicates that there is no big difference to the whole process compared to smaller modules in terms of shipment and installation, and after they have completed site work one or two times.
The distributed PV market, especially the large commercial and industry (C&I) rooftop segment, is very important for Trina Solar and I believe it will be very good to utilize our ultra-high power modules there. Considering several fast-growing countries in this region like India, Thailand, and Vietnam, which need more energy supply for their industrialization, sales growth of our ultra-high power modules is expected in 2022.
Three years ago, we realized the importance of distributed PV, which will be of “higher value” compared to utility PV. We then made a business transition from focusing on the utility sector to focusing on distributed PV. Now around 70% of our revenues in the Asia-Pacific region come from distributed PV.
The rising costs in the supply chain are totally out of the control of the PV module makers. For Trina Solar, what we can do is to try to keep low balance of system (BOS) and LCOE costs by implementing innovative technologies to new module products. Distributed PV customers are less price-sensitive, and they are more willing to adopt new technologies to reduce costs. That has been proven in our 2021 sales performance. Compared to our competitors who are more involved in utility-scale PV, Trina Solar has been least affected.
In the Asia-Pacific region, excluding China, India is our biggest market, followed by Australia. Some other countries will shift market positions from time to time. For instance, Vietnam was a shining star in 2020. According to our sources, their solar installation rates in 2021 were much lower than in the previous year. Thailand is another example: this country ranked top several years ago, but now installations are far behind the other leading countries. However, with a common target to reduce carbon emissions, the region is expected to increase solar installations in the coming years.
We expect growth of more than 20% in solar PV installations.
I think the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Vietnam will be four very promising markets, looking at their current growth rates.

Tony Carr, CEO of commercial and industrial solar company Starsight Energy, pointed to a “recent increase in grid [electricity] tariffs” in Nigeria as driving demand for PV after his company announced completion of an 876kWp system in Abuja for the Nile University of Nigeria.
European solar trade bodies have recently criticized moves by governments in Spain and Italy to protect households from electricity bills which are soaring on the back of rocketing gas prices.
Starsight, which is backed by London-based energy investor Helios Investment Partners and the African Infrastructure Investment Managers fund owned by South African banking group Old Mutual, installed two solar arrays with a total generation capacity of 876kWp at the university.
A press release issued by the installer on Thursday, to announce completion of the project, said it would be “one of the first in Nigeria” to generate carbon credits after Starsight secured the relevant accreditation.

Several projects are currently being developed and built outside the country's auction scheme for renewables over 1MW and the large capacities expected from these solar parks should be already operational in this and next year. These projects, however, are not the only signal that unsubsidized PV is gaining market share in Poland and an interesting trend has also been shown by the most recent auction held by the regulator, the Polish Energy Regulatory Office (ERO), in which not all contracted generation capacity has been allocated on the basis the electricity produced will be marketed under the auction's contracts for difference (CfD) mechanism.
“Because expected mid-term PPA prices for pay-as-produced or pay-as-forecasted are higher compared to expected cut-off prices from the CfD auction, bidders withheld a large share of their total energy volume,” Tim Steinert, from German consultancy Enervis, told pv magazine.
He explained that the Polish CfD auction awards a total energy amount in megawatt-hours with an indexed bid price over 15 years' time, instead of awarding generation capacity as most other auction systems in Europe do, and that bidders are free to distribute their total submitted electricity volume among the 15 years, prior to entry into the support system after a generation license has been obtained. “On average, we estimate that only 40% of the total potential energy volume, based on winning capacity, will be marketed under the CfD scheme and, therefore, mostly shifted towards the last years of the support system,” he further explained. “Vice versa, 60% will either be sold to PPA off-takers or on the spot market, most of them with a tenure of 5-10 years.”
Steiner also revealed that the lowest bid submitted for the auction was PLN139.6o/MWh ($34.57) and that it was most likely set by a project with a long-term PPA. “Therefore, just a fraction of the total volume was supposedly submitted under the CfD, to secure a binding obligation to conclude an interconnection agreement,” Steinert emphasized. “Alternatively, this might have been a smaller project with EU grant investment support which has to be deducted from the bid price.”
According to him, the current success of grid parity solar in Poland depends on several factors. “Mostly mid-term development of LCOE of PV, maturity of the project pipeline, and PPA price levels over the next years,” he also said. “One thing is quite clear: the Polish PPA market is on a steep rise and is more attractive compared to the CfD scheme in the current market situation.”
In the latest auction for renewable energy projects exceeding 1MW in size held by the ERO, solar accounted for around 570MW of the allocated capacity at an average price of PLN207.85/MWh.
Poland has, currently, an installed PV capacity of more than 6.3GW. The Polish PV market is expected to grow strongly during the current decade to reach 30GW of installed capacity by the end of 2030, according to the Polish research institute, the Instytut Energetyki Odnawialnej (IEO).

The Oslo-based data company is expecting the polysilicon industry to attain more than a million tons of annual production capacity this year to keep a lid on solar panel prices which leapt in 2021, in part thanks to a shortage of the raw material.
The new poly capacity, though, may not come soon enough to head off what Rystad described as a “potential downturn” in new big solar projects, “at least for the first half of the year,” with the analyst noting the dampening effect rising steel prices are having on the onshore wind sector.
The warning was issued in a note released by Rystad on Thursday in which the analyst predicted 220GW of new large scale renewable energy project capacity will arrive this year, including 12GW of battery capacity, more than 400MW of hydrogen production facilities, and an 18% rise in solar project spending, from $117 billion last year to $138 billion this.
Rystad stated solar makes up the biggest proportion of the 195GW of that total, 2022 renewables project figure which is already under construction, with PV laying claim to 46% of the capacity which is taking shape. Almost half of the projects which have already broken ground this year are in Asia, according to Rystad, chiefly in China and India.

On Feb.10, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a vast nuclear recovery plan, with the construction of six new EPR2 type reactors in France. He also promised an acceleration in the development of renewable energy, with new targets for photovoltaics and wind power by 2050.
“We have fallen behind,” Macron acknowledged in a speech. “We will increase our efforts in particular on solar energy, as it is cheaper and can be more easily integrated into the landscape and, by 2050, we will multiply by nearly 10 the installed power to exceed 100GW by ensuring a fair balance between rooftop PV installations and those on the ground.”
He also pointed to the multiplication of regulatory hurdles.
“The approval process to build a solar park takes five years and its construction only takes a few months of work, such delays are unbearable. It will therefore be necessary to remove all the regulatory barriers from the moment the projects are accepted locally,” he said.
He also reiterated the need to “rebuild French industrial sectors, to produce all the techniques necessary for the deployment of solar energy. Because it must be said, 20 years ago, Europe, out of naivety or fatality, left to other continents the care of producing technologies and the industrial sectors that were behind these deployments.”
French solar association Enerplan described this as an important step.
“It is the recognition by the highest authority of the state of the preponderant role of solar in the decarbonized energy transition and in the future mixed electric. The objective of at least 100GW of installed solar power by 2050 is in line with Enerplan's 2050 program which will be published in March.”
Daniel Bour, the president of Enerplan, praised the speech.
“For the first time, a president is announcing the massive role of solar power in the future mix of electricity. What a long way since 2011, the year of the moratorium when the sector almost disappeared. More than ever, we are mobilized to catch up with the delay taken by France and reach this objective of 100GW in 2050 –  that is, plus-5GW/year of new connected solar capacity.”

The London-based not-for-profit has estimated solar generation capacity would be consistently cheaper to develop than natural gas plants over the next five years and said the solar-plus-energy-storage systems which would enable PV to offer the sort of peak-energy-demand back-up power supply for the grid gas can boast, would be cheaper than the fossil fuel option within two years.
Carbon Tracker's Poland's Energy Dilemma report has estimated the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) to be generated by five natural gas plants planned by Warsaw over the next five years: the Dolna Odra I and II units planned for next year, each of which will have a generation capacity of 717MW; the 750MW Ostrołęka C plant in 2025; the 800MW Rybnik facility to be fired up the following year; and the 750MW Grudziądz project which is due to start generating in 2027.

Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.

Glancing at the bar charts Carbon Tracker uses to compare its anticipated electricity price from the gas plants with its expectations of renewables and energy storage facilities, the thinktank suggests a solar electricity LCOE of around $0.055/kWh would rise to around $0.094/kWh in conjunction with the energy storage tech which would allow the equivalent PV generation capacity to be able to come online and supply power during peak demand periods – the “peaker” capacity offered by the planned gas facilities.
That solar-plus-storage cost would be marginally higher than the $0.092/kWh Carbon Tracker suggests for the LCOE of electricity to be generated by the 1.43GW Odra plants planned to enter service next year.
By the second year of service for those facilities, however, the roughly $0.050/kWh electricity cost Carbon Tracker expects of Polish solar would rise to only $0.088/kWh with energy storage expense added, making that option cheaper than the $0.092/kWh price the London group estimates the electricity to be generated by Ostrołęka C would cost, in 2025. In fact, Carbon Tracker expects new solar-plus-storage facilities in Poland to undercut gas peaker plants in 2024.
The economic mismatch will become more pronounced in 2026, when the Rybnik gas plant is due to enter service, producing electricity for an estimated $0.091/kWh, according to Carbon Tracker, versus a Polish solar LCOE of around $0.049/kWh and a solar-plus-storage estimate of $0.081/kWh.
By the time the Grudziądz gas project is due to be fired up, five years from now, Carbon Tracker has predicted the $0.093/kWh cost of its electricity will be even more expensive than offshore wind plants coupled with energy storage, and well ahead of a solar-plus-storage LCOE estimate of around $0.0795/kWh which includes a Polish solar power cost of $0.048 or so.
If Carbon Tracker's predictions prove to be accurate, capacity market payments made by Warsaw to the owners of power plants which can be fired up as needed to provide extra generation capacity – and which the London not-for-profit has described as “much more generous” than in other EU nations – would leave Polish taxpayers on the hook for almost $4.5 billion to subsidize the planned gas plants.
On top of that, the Carbon Tracker report pointed out, net-zero climate change requirements would require the new power plants to be shuttered after an average of only seven years, at an additional cost of around $200 million to the Polish taxpayer.

“Our radiative cooler technology may be applied to all kinds of solar cells but it is most suitable for multi-junction solar cells with low bandgap, as it is the least vulnerable to sub-bandgap heating” the research's corresponding author, Gil Ju Lee, told pv magazine.
Radiative cooling is the principle all objects on Earth tend to emit part of the heat they receive from the sun’s infrared radiation. The atmosphere pushes that heat back to Earth, except for infrared wavelengths, which can escape the atmosphere.
The triple-junction solar cell was based on indium gallium phosphide (InGaP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and Germanium (Ge) and was made with a micro-grating made of glass, consisting of a two-dimensional x-framework structure fixed onto the surface of the solar cell. This structure is claimed to be able to efficiently emit the heat produced by the cell through the atmosphere into outer space. “Our research is the first theoretical and experimental demonstration of the effectiveness of radiative-cooler-integrated solar cells,” the scientists stated.
A clear and transparent ultraviolet curable adhesive was used to connect the cell with the cooler and no anti-reflection coating was applied on the cell. Gold metal was meshed on the device's topside and plated on its bottom side, with sapphire being used as the substrate. “The solar energy gain is considerably increased, particularly at the glazing angle, owing to the elongated optical path produced by the diffraction of the
light-trapping radiative cooling (LTRC),” the researchers explained.
The performance of the solar cell with the radiative cooler was analyzed through outdoor field tests under approximately 900 Wm-2 direct sunlight and was compared to that of a reference cell without the cooling technique. The operating temperature of the device with the cooler was found to be 6 degrees Celsius lower and its open-circuit voltage 2% higher. It also showed a higher short-circuit current of 0.5 mA.
“Our radiative cooler is based on a very cheap glass material,” Lee further explained, referring to the costs of the proposed technology. “An additional treatment should be added in the glass material to make a micro-grating two-dimensionally on the surface of the glass and, however, it might not be expensive because the glass is cheap and the technology for the micro-grating is mature.”
He also mentioned the possibility of using the radiative cooler to replace encapsulants in solar cells, which would more than offset its additional costs, according to the researcher. “The radiative cooler may offer the same degree of protection,” he emphasized, noting that the integration of the cooling technology in commercial solar module production may be achieved easily, with bigger scales helping further reduce the costs of the coolers.
The new tech was presented in the paper Determining the Effectiveness of Radiative Cooler-Integrated Solar Cells, published in Advanced Energy Materials. “The radiative cooling approach presented in this study is effective especially for the multi-junction solar cells and also for concentrating photovoltaic cells,” the scientists concluded.
Radiative cooling was recently applied to solar panel cooling by researchers from the Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait.
A group of researchers from at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China has recently conducted a review of the possible combinations between radiative cooling (RC) techniques and solar energy systems of different kinds

Verdagy, a company that is developing a water-based electrolyzer for green hydrogen production, has secured cash to scale its technology in a $25 million funding round led by TDK Ventures, Orbia, BHP Ventures, Doral Energy, Tech Ventures, Kholsa Ventures, Shell Ventures, and Temasek.
The technology is designed to provide hydrogen fuel for heavy industrial applications, a sector responsible for about one third of global emissions. The electrolyzer can reduce its carbon impact by being supplied with sources like solar and wind.
Verdagy was spun off from chemical company Chemetry in May 2021 to develop a novel design to water electrolysis. The company’s device splits water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules through an electric current. The membrane-based technology uses large active area cells, high current densities, and broad operating ranges to deliver hydrogen at scale.
The company said its industry-largest cells operate at energy densities 10 times higher than traditional alkaline water electrolysis. The company said it has a load shedding ability of 95% to reduce energy costs and maximize production.
Analysts are now predicting that the global green hydrogen market will reach $89 billion by 2030, said Verdagy. Rising demand and falling costs has led to both renewable energy and electrolysis prices falling 50% to 60% every five years, said the company.
Verdagy operates a pilot plant in Moss Landing, California, a hotbed for large-scale energy storage and solar development.
“We believe that green hydrogen at the right scale and cost is key to decarbonizing industrial processing of steel, aluminum, cement and chemicals – and in combination with captured CO2, enables the production of other chemical feedstocks and liquid fuels for marine and aviation applications,” said Sameer Bharadwaj, CEO of Orbia. “Orbia hopes to contribute to Verdagy’s success with its expertise in basic and advanced materials, large-scale chemical processes and a keen focus on decarbonization technologies that support a sustainable future.”
Orbia said it is simultaneously investing in food security and growth, water management, infrastructure development, data access, health advancement and sustainable energy, energy storage and decarbonization alongside hydrogen electrolysis.

Marinus Link has launched a major marine engineering survey to identify the optimum route for an undersea cable to connect Tasmania and the Australian state of Victoria.
Marinus Link said the survey, the third for the project and the largest so far, will build on results and analysis of previous site investigations and help identify the most suitable corridor for burying the project’s undersea high voltage direct current (HVDC) cable.
Marinus Link Chief Executive Bess Clark said the survey work is “well underway, with feet on the ground and a ship being mobilized.”
The survey will focus on 255 kilometers of space between Heybridge in northwest Tasmania and Waratah Bay in South Gippsland, Victoria. Those on board the vessel will investigate approximately 110 sites across the Bass Strait, in sea depths up to 80 meters. The survey is expected to take between four to six weeks to complete.
Clark has previously said the proposed project will “give Australians access to cheaper, clean, reliable energy and transform Tasmania into a renewable energy powerhouse.”
“With Project Marinus, businesses and investors in mainland Australia will have the assurance of a stable power supply when solar and wind generation is not available and batteries have run out,” she said. “Along with other major transmission projects, Project Marinus will become the backbone of a reliable, lower emissions NEM for the next decade and beyond.”
The current target date for commissioning and commercial operation of the first 750MW stage of the Marinus Link project is 2027-28. Commissioning and commercial operation of the second 750MW stage is currently scheduled for 2029-30.
The start of the survey follows the Tasmanian government’s announcement that it has terminated its commercial agreement with the company that operates the Basslink undersea cable that currently links the island state’s grid to the mainland.
Tasmania Energy Minister Guy Barnett said in a statement on Thursday the government and state-owned utility Hydro Tasmania had taken “another step” towards protecting their legal rights, by terminating the Basslink Services Agreement (BSA).
The move is the latest in a long-running legal dispute between the government and the operators of the link following a months-long failure of the interconnector in 2015 which contributed to an energy crisis in the state. A 2020 arbitration concerning the cause of the outage found the link cannot meet the capacity requirements set out in the BSA.
Barnett said since then the government and Hydro Tasmania have been in negotiations with Basslink’s receivers “regarding an alternative commercial arrangement.” The termination of the BSA is not expected to impact Tasmania’s energy security with Barnett saying the interconnector will remain in service while negotiations continue.
Hydro Tasmania said it remains willing to discuss with receivers an alternative commercial model that could include key elements of the BSA, that would provide funding during the receivership and help transition the asset to an alternative commercial model.
