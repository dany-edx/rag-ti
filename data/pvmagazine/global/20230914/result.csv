It has found that its EarthStore energy storage system can provide 18 hours or more of storage capacity to effectively generate baseload power 24/7 when paired with solar or wind generation.
The data sets were obtained by pumping in and flowing back water from a well to gauge capacity and power duration. According to the company, no induced seismicity was measured either during fracturing or subsequent pumping operations.
The pilot plant has demonstrated that it can also provide high-powered, short-duration power during peak demand.
“Both storage intervals, long- and short-duration, enhance grid reliability with stable power output,” the company reported. “In addition, the heat from the formation expands the fluid downhole and improves round trip efficiency.”
Sage has developed an underground energy storage technology which can provide both short- and long-duration storage. The system harvests the pressure energy of a fluid while using  geothermal power from any underground formation where the required heat level exists to enhance its operation. The company is targeting lower temperatures (100 C to 250 C) at depths of three to 6 kilometers.
According to Sage, its EarthStore energy storage design is ready to scale and is not geographically limited. In addition, it can be used in newly drilled wells and in existing oil and gas wells.
The company has also reported that based on the levelized cost of storage (LCOS), EarthStore can provide power at a cost that is lower than lithium-ion battery storage and traditional pumped storage hydro.
“It also is competitive with natural gas peaker plants, providing a cleaner option for providing ancillary services, black start services, and/or redistributing curtailed energy during peak demand periods,” Sage said. However, the company didn't provide any hard figures for LCOS.
Other reported results of the pilot project are as follows:
“We have cracked the code to provide the perfect complement to renewable energy, yielding reliable alternative baseload in a manner that is cost competitive with lithium-ion batteries and natural gas peaker plants,” said Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems. “The opportunities for our energy storage to provide power are significant – from remote mining operations to data centers to solving energy poverty in remote locations. We can interconnect with power grids or develop island/microgrids with a cleaner energy solution that is proven and ready to scale.”

The project in Hatta will be completed by the first half of 2025.
The AED 1.421 billion ($368.8 million) project will have a capacity of 250 MW/1,500 MWh. It will have a lifespan of 80 years, a turnaround efficiency of 78.9%, and a response to demand for energy within 90 seconds.
“The hydroelectric power plant is an energy storage with turnaround efficiency of 78.9%,” the statement added. “It utilizes the potential energy of the water stored in the upper dam which is converted to kinetic energy during the flow of water through the 1.2-kilometer subterranean tunnel and this kinetic energy rotates the turbine and converts mechanical energy to electrical energy which is sent to DEWA grid.”
The company has now finished the project’s upper dam, including a water upper intake structure and associated bridge. It has also concluded the construction of the 72-meter concrete wall of the upper dam.
In June 2022, the construction of the facility stood at 44%. At the time, DEWA said it would also store electricity from the 5 GW Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. The facility, which is partly operational and partly under construction, is the biggest solar plant in the United Arab Emirates and the Middle East.

“The NTU approach demonstrated a higher recovery rate and purity than present silicon recovery technologies,” the research's lead author, Sim Ying, told pv magazine. “We used the recovered silicon in a lithium-ion battery anode and tested it for efficiency. Results showed that it performed similarly to new, commercially bought silicon.”
In the paper “Simplified silicon recovery from photovoltaic waste enables high performance, sustainable lithium-ion batteries,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, the research team explained that the common approaches for recycling silicon from PV panels use two reagents – nitric acid (HNO3) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) – to separate the metals from silicon cells.
Despite their effectiveness and accessibility, these two reagents generate both acidic and alkaline post-treatment solutions that need to be treated separately and require a post-treatment to remove the anti-reflective coating (ARC) from the recovered silicon. “Furthermore, the KOH step in the double reagent approach has detrimental effect on the recovery yield and purity of recovered silicon,” the researchers said.
For their new process, the academics used only one reagent – phosphoric acid (H3PO4) – which they claimed eliminates the need for all above-mentioned post-treatments. Moreover, this reagent is also always used in the etching paste used for ARC removal and, by targeting directly the ARC layer, is able to separate the silver (Ag) and aluminum (Al) from the wafer surface.
The scientists said that the proposed technique is able to efficiently leach out the Al and detach the Ag electrodes from the solar cells, while also being capable of removing the ARC with minimal generation of precipitates during the treatment. “Use of H3PO4 does not lead to Si dissolution, as seen in both the double reagent approaches,” they explained, noting that their sample achieved a recovery rate of 98.9% with a purity of 99.2%.
The research group utilized the recycled silicon in a lithium-ion battery anode and found it performed similarly to new, commercially bought silicon. “The long-term cycling of the recovered silicon managed to retain 62.3% of its initial specific capacity (1086.6 mAh g 1) after 500 cycles while maintaining high coulombic efficiency of over 99%,” it added, referring to the performance of the tested storage system.
“The comparable performance between our upcycled silicon-based lithium-ion battery and the newly purchased ones proves that the NTU approach is feasible,” said Ying. “We envision our faster and cheaper silicon recovery method to be a positive boost for the development of EV batteries. Aside from EVs, there are also potential applications such as thermoelectric devices.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/14/time-for-an-upgrade/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,EUROPE,FRANCE",,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2023",Time for an upgrade?,"From pv magazine 09/23
The mid to late 2000s saw a major influx of technological innovations that we now consider indispensable – from the first iPhone to tablet computers, new-generation gaming consoles, and e-readers. Another major technology that saw a significant sales boom during this time was solar power, with Europe experiencing a fourfold increase in installed solar capacity from 2008 to 2011, and a significant rise in green energy production as a result.
Fast-forward to today and there is arguably more appetite than ever for renewables. In the wake of the Ukraine war, businesses and individuals alike are looking to become increasingly sustainable and self-reliant in how they source their energy. BayWa re’s own research report, “The Decade That Matters 2.0,” indicates that 96% of UK and European businesses are either already sourcing their energy from renewables or plan to in the near future. Meanwhile, rising energy costs have meant that the solar investment payback period has fallen from around 16 years to four, making it a more appealing investment.
As we’ll come to explore, though, the building of new renewables plants is not the only way to secure a faster energy transition. A significant and often overlooked way of boosting existing installations is available through revamping and repowering.
Few among us still own an original iPod, Kindle, or PlayStation from the 2000s. These have long since been upgraded due to their lagging response times and a drop in output. The same goes for the life cycle of solar plants: In the 12-plus years since the solar boom, there have been major developments when it comes to the efficiency of solar technology. Many old parks have begun to lose energy output and fall behind the latest advancements. So, why is it that we’re not as quick to update this technology as we are with our personal devices?
This is especially puzzling when we consider that revamping and repowering affords us a way to harness the advancements of modern technology to improve output and extend the lifespan of solar installations. This way, we are ensuring that the latest advancements in solar technology are not reserved solely for newcomers to the green energy transition. By investing in existing structures, solar owners can restore plants to their original installed capacity, optimize efficiency, improve land use, and increase energy output.
The case for repowering and revamping is clear but what do the processes involve? Revamping is the replacement of technology, or any under-performing components, with newer versions that will improve an asset’s energy production. Repowering refers to an increase of the installed generation capacity of assets, to produce much more power.
For example, a power plant in Aude, southern France, was able to boost its energy yield by 38% after revamping, while using approximately half the land area that had been allocated to solar. This meant there was, subsequently, enough freed-up space to build an entirely new plant and to produce up to two and a half times the energy that the site had generated before.
Revamping and repowering have the potential to accelerate the transition to renewables by reinforcing and even increasing the benefits of solar technology. This is not a half-hearted upgrade that adds a bigger touchscreen or a new camera – this is a major leap, the equivalent of going from a legacy mobile phone to a smartphone.
As well as injecting old solar-technology installations with new life, revamping and repowering plays a role in reinforcing the benefits of solar. A key manner in which revamping and repowering do this is through the renewed efficiency they bring to solar installations. The boosted energy yield at the aforementioned solar plant in Aude illustrates how revamped and repowered solar units make a strong case for the effectiveness of solar as a source of reliable and sustainable power.
Another considerable benefit is reduced costs. A persistent, common misunderstanding is the belief that solar energy is too expensive, with initial outlay overshadowing any potential savings. Yet, as we’ve already seen, escalating energy prices are increasingly maximizing solar power’s financial benefits, not just through the savings associated with self-sufficient energy production, but also through the added potential to sell surplus energy back to the grid.
On top of that, decommissioned components that are still functional and performing – typically modules and inverters – can find new owners. There is a developing market for pre-owned equipment which can benefit users that have more restrictive budgets.
Given its considerable advantages, how should solar site owners go about revamping and repowering their installations? The first step is assessing the financial performance of an asset. Asking what the current costs and energy output are compared to what they could be after repowering gives owners a good idea of just how valuable such an investment will be. There are now many more options with repowering and revamping, and broader business plans than ever before. We used to be limited to incentives such as feed-in-tariffs or net metering but now we have the options of self-consumption and energy storage – changing the way solar plants are used in the process.
There are several technical components available on the market, so it’s important that asset owners do their due diligence when it comes to compatibility and determining which components are best suited to a proposed project. This could come down to energy output and the amount of available space. Essentially, owners should be looking at how their solar installation can work hardest for them.
Finally, legislation must be looked into, to ensure that any planned changes will be compliant with local and national regulations. The red tape surrounding renewables can be frustratingly extensive in some countries. While efforts are under way to smooth out these processes, it can be worth accounting for prospective waiting times.
The revamping and repowering process is not without complexity, of course, and a significant part of this is navigating through business models, technical requirements, and legal compliance. To some extent, revamping and repowering can be included within operations and maintenance services but other competencies are also needed that additionally include engineering, planning and construction, and familiarity with early-generation equipment. This is why it is advantageous to partner with specialized, multidisciplinary companies within which several departments can collaborate.
In the same way that a Nokia 3310 is not capable of the same functions as today’s smartphones, green energy technology from the early 2000s cannot compare to what is available now. But unlike our mobile phones, when it comes to failing to update solar hardware, the stakes are much higher. As equipment at aging solar parks wears out over time, conversion efficiency continues to drop and potential is wasted.
Put simply, this is the decade that matters and there’s no time to lose. Repowering and revamping must be prioritized to maintain the potential of solar assets moving forward.

The governors of 10 Argentinean provinces – the so-called “Norte Grande” group – have reached an agreement with members of the national government to build 2.5 GW of solar capacity, as part of a plan that could require an investment of up to $2.5 billion.
The regional governments said the plant will mostly serve regional energy distributors.
The 2,500 MW will be built across the provinces as follows:
Tucumán: 14.86%, 370 MW
Chaco: 14.12%, 350 MW
Currents: 13.93%, 345 MW
Missions: 13.18%, 330 MW
Salta: 10.31%, 255 MW
Santiago del Estero: 08.43%, 210 MW
La Rioja: 07.31%, 180 MW
Formosa: 06.43%, 160 MW
Catamarca: 06.18%, 155 MW
Jujuy: 05.25%, 145 MW
Technical teams from Cammesa, the company that manages the country’s wholesale electricity market, are now analyzing the proposal.
Argentina's largest PV plant is currently the Cauchari project – an operational 300 MW facility that is now being expanded to 500 MW. The country reached 1,184 MW of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of March.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/14/powering-rural-nigeria/,"SPONSORED,NIGERIA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA",,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2023",Powering rural Nigeria,"The REA is Nigeria's federal government agency that was created to facilitate off-grid development. Initially, the country's power sector was integrated with a monopolistic arrangement. The sector was recently unbundled, based on the promulgation of the Electricity Power Sector Reform Act (EPSRA), and transmission, generation, and distribution were all separated. Private sector participation was encouraged by the act, and it led to the creation of the REA with the mandate of facilitating the Rural Electrification Fund and the development of off-grid electrification for rural and unserved areas.
As part of the implementation of the REA, the federal government, in collaboration with the agency, secured $250 million in funding from the World Bank and $200 million from the African Development Bank for the Nigerian Electrification Project (NEP). The project was designed to incentivize private sector participation and facilitate the development of sustainable electricity.
There's a lot that needs to be done. Figures provided by the World Bank show that over 85 million people in Nigeria are either not served or are underserved in electricity, with most of them living in rural areas. A lot still needs to be done to provide electricity in rural areas.
EPSRA provided the enabling ground for private sector participation. The federal government’s Vision 2030 has a framework where renewable energy is an integral part of the country. The Rural Electrification Strategy and Implementation Plan (RESIP) provides details for how the REA operates within the country and provides an operational framework.
We have different components designed to target specific areas of need. In all these components, there is a need for a huge provision of inverters, batteries, solar systems, PV panels, communication, and appliances that ensure mini-grids are working and communicating with a system that monitors their performance. The relationship with Huawei is the provision of these key requirements to build the mini-grids. We have seen lots of participation and collaboration with Huawei. This is because of the company’s presence in the country and because they have after-sales support systems that are attractive to EPC [engineering, procurement, and construction services] companies.
Currently, we have built 83 mini-grids covering over 26,000 connections. We have over 200,000 connections in the pipeline, and we have over 1.4 million connections impacting over 6 million Nigerians for solar home systems. We cover seven teaching institutions (universities) and one hospital, helping over 150,000 students with a ready, conducive learning environment.

Based on our learning from phase 1, which is implemented, we had to develop a sustainability plan to make the project a hybrid whereby there is a connection with the distribution network. It's a hybrid system to ensure sustainability during the nighttime, when there is no solar irradiation. The system is connected to the distribution network at night and relies on grid provision during the day. There's a provision for metering for payment for all connections. There is adequate monitoring of all connections to ensure payment and utilization within the operational framework designed for the mini-grids.
If you look at implementation in Africa, the Nigerian project has been a trailblazer. We have been the pace-setter and other African countries come to us to learn how we implemented our projects. Initially, it was challenging to have developers trust the system and buy into the idea. Many modifications and engagements had to be made to get the private sector in. At this moment, the private sector has seen the operating framework and has trusted the system. The challenge now is expansion because there is a lot of demand from the private sector to partner. Our challenge is having adequate funds to meet the demand.
We have seen the effectiveness of technology in implementing the NEP. Without technology, some of the NEP’s key objectives wouldn't have been achieved. We use technology to verify the connections, monitor the performance of the mini-grids, and ensure we reduce commercial losses and technical losses. Without technology, nothing can be achieved under the NEP. If you look at the cost of PV panels 10 years ago compared to now, there is a massive reduction in price due to technological improvements. Without technology, we would never have achieved even 10% of our accomplishments. I see technology as continually playing a role in shaping how we work, reducing costs, and making work easier.
We have deployed 83 functional mini-grids, distributed countrywide, with over 1.4 million solar home systems that are working. We’ve also stimulated private sector participation and have improved the economy by creating direct and indirect job opportunities.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/14/three-steps-to-reduce-battery-storage-fire-risk/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2023",Three steps to reduce battery storage fire risk,"High-profile lithium-ion battery fires have given rise to growing concerns regarding their safety and exposed a lack of understanding about the risks associated with this type of technology. Specifically, fire incidents in battery energy storage systems (BESS) have proved to be harmful to the industry, resulting in postponement and even cancellation of projects in some parts of the world.
A new report released by Firetrace International, a US-based fire suppression technology supplier, says that “there is a real danger public opposition to energy storage could grow significantly as a result of fire risk fears, threatening critical battery deployment and, as a result, net zero goals.”
What is more, BESS fire incidents have also had an impact on the insurance market. In its report, Firetrance presents evidence that the appetite to cover energy storage projects has declined, with some insurers even exiting the market.
“This has resulted in increased premiums, higher excesses, and difficulties in securing 100% cover. Addressing the fire risk of battery storage has thus become a focal point for owners, contractors, and operators,” reads the report titled “How to reduce battery storage fire risk.”
The report looks at different types of fire hazards facing energy storage projects as well as the way in which the industry has already looked to mitigate these risks through planning, design, construction, and the installation of fire protection systems.
In conclusion, the report highlights the three next steps asset manufacturers, developers and asset owners need to take to mitigate the fire risk.
Some of the main causes that can lead to lithium-ion batteries catching fire are inherent cell defects, improper installation, physical abuse, or operation of BESS outside of prescribed parameters, such as charge rate, state of charge or temperature. Once triggered, battery fires are self-sustaining and difficult to put out.
“There are fire suppression companies who claim their systems can suppress lithium-ion battery fires and prevent thermal runaway,” said Brian Cashion, engineering manager at Firetrace International.
“We don’t believe the industry can make these claims yet because there is no publicly available test data proving these claims in real world test scenarios and doing so risks a second wave of public scrutiny. It is crucial we get the solution right,” Cashion stated.
The US supplier notes that this is “very possible with the right planning, design and collaboration”.
Finally, the report highlights the role of regulation in mitigating BESS fires and recommends changes to the current frameworks in the United States.
According to Firetrance, storage fire risk regulations in the US are developing haphazardly on a state-by-state basis, a scenario that is creating considerable confusion and forcing energy storage owners to retrofit fire suppression systems in order to comply with evolving regulatory frameworks.
The report suggests that other states should adopt the International Fire Code (IFC) in place in New York and California.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/14/india-posts-76-yoy-decline-in-solar-module-imports-from-china-in-h1/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2023",India posts 76% YoY decline in solar module imports from China in H1,"From pv magazine India
India has experienced a 76% year-on-year decline in its solar module imports from China, according to energy think tank Ember. During the first half of 2023, India imported 2.3 GW of modules from China, from 9.8 GW imported during the corresponding period in 2022. This decline was attributed to the imposition of tariffs and India's shift toward bolstering domestic manufacturing capacity.
The report shows that India stands alone as the only country to experience a substantial decrease in PV panel imports from China. As India focused and prioritized domestic solar manufacturing, Asia became the only region to see fewer solar imports from China over the first half of 2023.
“India’s dependence on China for solar module imports is well and truly reducing post-2022 with domestic manufacturing now starting to ramp up as a result of the recent policy interventions,” said Neshwin Rodrigues, India electricity policy analyst for Ember. “As India gets closer to being self-sufficient in solar manufacturing, overreliance on Chinese modules and cells is no longer the limiting factor. What’s needed now is an effective policy environment to ensure solar installations also ramp up commensurately to not fall behind the National Electricity Plan targets.”
The Ember report looks at Chinese export data and introduces a new data set that offers current monthly information for each destination country. China commands more than 80% of the global market share of solar manufacturing capacity, and the expansion of Chinese exports carries global implications for the advancement of clean energy.
China's solar panel exports surged by 34% in the first half of 2023, totaling 114 GW worldwide, in contrast to 85 GW during the same period the previous year. Europe accounted for the majority, representing 58% (66 GW) of China's solar module exports in the first half of 2023. This region also experienced the most significant absolute growth worldwide, with a 47% year-on-year increase in solar panel imports from China.
Following Europe, Brazil emerged as the second-largest importer, receiving 9.5 GW of Chinese solar panel exports in the first half of 2023. The report also notes that India has become the second-largest importer of China-made solar cells, trailing only behind Turkey.

The International Energy Agency reports that global solar PV manufacturing capacity has surged by more than 70% to reach almost 450 GW in 2022. Projections indicate that it will double once more, reaching nearly 1,000 GW of capacity per year by 2024. While China remains the primary contributor to this growth, approximately 70 GW of annual capacity is set to be added in the United States, Europe, India, and various Asian countries.
“We have enough solar panels, we just need to get busy installing them,” said Sam Hawkins, data lead at Ember. “Policies should focus on ensuring installation and grid integration can ramp up as fast as global module supply.”

The proposed technology offers the advantage of bypassing the need to control the compressor of the heat pump.
In the paper “Performance improvement of air-source heat pump via optimum control based on artificial neural network,” published in Energy Reports, the Korean group explained that the OCL system is able to identify the parameters that increase the system performance, without changing the main components of the system, which in turn reduces system costs.
“An ANN model was developed to prevent overfitting errors, by constructing a training dataset in the form of synthetic time-series load data,” they added, noting that overfitting errors occur when the model fits too closely to the training dataset instead. “Machine learning algorithms can render good predictions on the data used to train the model but may be limited by overfitting and not generalizing adequately according to new data.”
Previous models for optimizing ASHPs were based on controlling the compressor, which the scientists said is not an in-field valid solution, as heat pump manufacturers tend to limit this function in their products. Their optimization technique, by contrast, is based on the secondary-side working fluid of the heat pump, which can be controlled after conducting minor changes to a standard system.
In a heat pump, the secondary refrigerant is the fluid that acts as an intermediary to transfer heat between the primary refrigerant and the space that needs to be heated or cooled. The researchers used water as the secondary refrigerant controlled by the ANN.
In order to train the model, the scientists provided it with some 762,000 data points based on a real ASHP system located in a building facility in the South Korean city of Busan. The data was then verified using some 254,000 data points from the same facility, and was then tested against an identical number of data points.
The academics compared the performance of the AI-assisted ASHP with that of a benchmark ASHP without the ANN. They found that novel control technique can help improve significantly the heat pump coefficient of performance (COP). “The improvement in the energy performance of the optimum models with respect to the conventional models was: 1.52% and 3.58% for the cooling and heating system COP, respectively, and 0.76% and 0.81% for the heat pump COP,” they specified.
The researchers also conducted an economic analysis of the AI-modified heat pump system. According to their results, the payback time of that novel system is 11.6 years, while the system's lifetime is 15 years, which they claim makes it “possible to recover the initial investment during the life cycle.”

Recent analysis from solar and storage analyst Sunwiz shows that Australia’s large-scale renewable segment is languishing. Looking at the Sunwiz graphs breaking down large-scale certificates (LGCs) registered in each state, the graphs reveal the segment is utterly flat in most regions.
“Look at how much flatness there is. It’s only really Queensland that is going up right now,” Sunwiz’s Warwick Johnston told pv magazine Australia.
Over the last three years, both Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) have pulled way in front of the other states. Nonetheless, even New South Wales has had an incredibly flat 2023.
These figures encompass both utility-scale renewable generation projects as well as larger commercial and industrial installations, Johnston noted.
“There will inevitably be more businesses putting solar on in the coming six months, and so the pressure that has built up will get released in that [C&I] segment,” he said. “But such a stall that has occurred at the level of grid-scale solar, we don’t see it being resolved – not in any fast, quick and soon way. The energy transition in Australia is at risk of losing its social license if we continue to go so slowly because people will face high electricity prices if coal isn’t replaced with renewables. There’s a lot of barriers there that absolutely have to be addressed so we can get cheap, bulk energy. But we need that cheap bulk energy now and in the coming two, three years.”
He expressed concern about the reduction of subsidies for small-scale projects while waiting for solutions in the large-scale sector. He also noted the potential risks associated with this approach.
He is referring to the gradual winding back of Australia’s small-scale certificate scheme, which will end completely in 2030. He said that one way to get things flowing better would be to make commercial solar up to 1 MW eligible for STCs. In his eyes, “not enough” is happening in the regulatory space to start solving the issues of grid scale solar, including approval delays, grid connection and transmission.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/14/stryten-energy-vanadium-redox-flow-battery-on-path-to-commercialization/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,GEORGIA,UNITED STATES",VALERIE THOMPSON,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2023",Stryten Energy vanadium redox flow battery on path to commercialization,"Stryten Energy, a US-based battery technology company, recently installed a pilot-sized version of its vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) at a facility operated by Snapping Shoals EMC, an electricity cooperative in Georgia, United States.
The battery is a 20 kW/120 kWh VRFB with a recharge time of 7.5 hours and connected to the grid at 480V. It is made of several modules with built-in safety features, each operating independently at 6.67 kW/40 kWh per cycle.
“We specifically designed and sized this system for an initial evaluation phase with Snapping Shoals where we will conduct long-duration testing that is six hours or more,” Scott Childers, Vice President, Essential Power, Stryten Energy, told pv magazine.
The vanadium electrolyte aqueous solution is a proprietary combination of sulfuric acid and vanadium oxides. It is stable up to 50 C, but the system can be designed to mitigate external temperature effects beyond this range, according to Childers. Furthermore, the VRFB system is supported by remote management software, and the ability to track and store performance data.
“As product commercialization matures, Stryten Energy’s VRFB will be highly scalable in order to serve kW to MW to meet the needs of commercial and industrial customers through to full-scale utilities,” said Childers.
The VRFB technology, originally developed with Storion Energy, a US-based startup that Stryten acquired last year, is not yet used by a solar PV customer, but a prototype VRFB system is installed at a PV plant in the Colorado test facility, known as Solar Technology Acceleration Center (SolarTAC). It has already dispatched 30 MWh of energy over 1,100 cycles, demonstrating that the system is capable of storing solar energy to be deployed on demand as needed, according to Childers.
Stryten Energy anticipates the VRFB will be commercially available in January 2025. The company plans a complete US-based supply chain and manufacturing of all components of the VRFB system, including the vanadium electrolyte. A manufacturing location has not yet been selected.

The storage systems have a combined capacity of 3,045 MW and a maximum storage capacity of 4.893 MWh. This compares to 1,530 MW/2,752 MWh of distributed storage capacity at the end of 2022 and just 189.5 MW/295.6 MWh at the end of 2020.
The new capacity for the first half of 2023 was 1,468 MW/2,058 MWh, which marks the strongest growth ever recorded for storage deployment in the first half of the year in the country.
The new figures indicate that lithium-ion technology powers most devices, at 386,021 units in total. Lombardy is the region with the highest deployment of such storage systems, boasting a combined capacity of 275 MW/375 MWh.
The regional government is implementing a multi-year rebate scheme for residential and commercial storage systems coupled with PV.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/14/a-terawatt-of-solar-module-capacity-expected-within-16-months/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2023",A terawatt of solar module capacity expected within 16 months,"The terawatt era has arrived, and the world is unprepared. As the industry explodes in volume, solar and related professionals must prepare, adapt – and deploy.
In its recent Q2 PV Supplier Market Intelligence report, Clean Energy Associates (CEA) highlighted significant growth in solar module manufacturing by Chinese solar module manufacturers. From a 405 GW manufacturing capacity in 2022, a projected 114% increase is expected, reaching 866 GW by the end of 2023. Following that, a subsequent 21% surge in 2024 will bring the total to an impressive 1.043 TW globally.

This rapid growth surpassed many industry predictions. Still, insiders within the Chinese government, having played a pivotal role in this boom, likely foresaw such a rise.
A closer look at the numbers reveals that by the end of 2024, Chinese domestic capacity could be responsible for approximately 0.93 terawatts of their total global capacity. Southeast Asia is anticipated to account for less than 7% (0.068 TW), the Americas just over 2% (0.023 TW), and non-China Asian markets might contribute about 1% (0.011 TW).
Major, European and American manufacturers, such as Meyer Burger and First Solar, were not considered in this study. The assessment predominantly revolved around:

The majority of this capacity is earmarked for n-type solar cells. Yet, a bottleneck seems evident in the production process. CEA’s data suggests that cell production lags behind module manufacturing, with wafer and polysilicon ingot capacities trailing by several hundred gigawatts.
China’s heavily centralized solar power market, underpinned by extensive governmental oversight, might see these predictions shift. Whether solar module manufacturing capacities will be fine-tuned remains uncertain.

Aligning with – and surpassing – these projections, Bernreuter Research suggests that long term Chinese plans include up to 3.5 TW of manufacturing capacity by 2027. PVEL’s findings indicate that the 3.5 million metric tons of capacity might be operational by the end of next year. Considering 2.2 grams of polysilicon are required for a watt of solar panels, PVEL estimates that polysilicon supplies could generate 1.6 TW of solar modules.
If we build it, will they come?
The question remains: if this manufacturing capacity is available, will there be adequate installers, grid capacity, and batteries to absorb the surplus daytime production?
Analyst Jenny Chase of BNEF splashed a little cold-water on our enthusiasm, pointing out the reality that oftentimes, solar module factory capacity is 1.5 to 3 times greater than actual installed capacity. Underutilization of manufacturing capacity is normal.
Chase noted:
Maybe 1TW will be installed in 2025, but not just because the module factories exist.
BloombergNEF’s recent projections estimate 392 GW to be installed in 2023 and around 500 GW in 2025. These figures are based on their medium volume projections, though they also offer both lower and higher range projections.

Integrating such a large volume safely into the power grid poses daunting technical challenges. The U.S., the world’s second-largest solar market, has experienced delays in interconnections, slowing solar’s rapid ascent. Specifically, the PJM territory, within the broader United States’ Eastern Interconnection region, halted all new renewable energy projects for two years while grappling with hundreds of gigawatts of projects vying for grid access. As the U.S. interconnection queue nears 2 TW of capacity, both the time and cost of connections have escalated.

State markets have also put the brakes on their local distribution markets. When Massachusetts’ SMART program was launched, National Grid’s territory was overwhelmed with applications, causing unforeseen halts in development. Using public data, pv magazine USA predicted that National Grid’s area would instantly fill its entire 800 MW project tranche. Our prediction was spot on. Yet, the utility expressed astonishment, stating, “we’re all a little surprised by how quickly we got to this saturation.” As a result, they slammed the brakes on development, putting a billion dollars of projects on standby.
This unexpected turn prompted a state investigation. Despite this, grid connections remained sluggish, and currently, numerous substations within the state can’t accommodate additional solar projects.
China, the world’s largest renewable market, initially managed the surge in wind and solar by curtailing excess generation. They later developed a nationwide high voltage direct current (HVDC) network to channel power from the interior regions to the densely populated coast.
The growth rate of solar energy is undeniably accelerating. Having achieved our first terawatt of installed solar in early 2022, discussions swiftly transitioned to reaching 1 TW of capacity annually before the end of the decade. We then speculated that a second terawatt might be realized in just three years.
There’s a budding optimism that we might witness a unique milestone: a terawatt installed within a single year in the near future. Truly, that would be an accelerating transition.
