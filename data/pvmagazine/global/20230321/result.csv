Michaël Tanchum, an associate senior policy fellow in the ECFR's Africa program, notes the potential to develop sustainable, resilient food production value chains in the western Mediterranean region. “Italian participation in Morocco’s production of green hydrogen and its derivative green ammonia would help render fertilizers, a fundamental component of food production, more resilient against natural gas supply shocks,” said Tanchum.
Germany's Federal Ministry for Economics Affairs and Climate Action is now reviewing a new study on hydrogen. The report, prepared by a working group, suggests that hydrogen will not play a role in Germany’s plan to achieve climate neutrality in buildings by 2045.
Centrica and Lhyfe have agreed to jointly develop offshore renewable green hydrogen in the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies said they will collaborate on a pilot green hydrogen production site in the southern part of the North Sea.
Lhyfe also separately revealed that it has acquired a 49% stake in Flexens, a Finnish developer of renewable and green hydrogen and power-to-X projects. “This is the first investment for Lhyfe,” said the French company. “The move will accelerate the commercial deployment and Finland-based projects of both entities.” Flexens has a commercial pipeline with a total expected capacity of more than 1.5 GW, in Finland and other countries.

The study only considers global reservoirs larger than 0.01 km2, with 30% of their area covered but not exceeding 30 km2. The academics used three global databases to filter the eligible reservoirs, Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD), the Georeferenced Global Dam and Reservoir (GeoDAR), and OpenStreetMap (OSM). There are a total of 114,555 reservoirs worldwide meeting the criteria with a total area of 554,111 km2. Of those, 2,561 reservoirs already have hydraulic power generation and grid infrastructure in place.
“Unlike previous studies that use empirical formulas to estimate the FPV electricity generation potential, we use a technically rigorous PV system performance (PV_LIB, Sandia National Laboratories) that considers climate conditions and the specifications of the particular PV and inverter used,” the scientists said.
The solar panel is Panasonic’s VBHN235SA06B, with an output of 235 W and 18.6% efficiency. The 240 V inverter is also from the Japanese manufacturer. The team used data for solar radiation, temperature, and wind speed spanning from 2001 to 2020, from the Synoptic 1 degree (SYN1deg) and ECMWF Reanalysis version 5 – Land (ERA5-Land) databases.
The results showed that the mean annual electricity generation potential from FPV built on global reservoirs is 9,434 TWh, with a standard deviation of 29 TWh. Covering 30% of reservoirs with floating solar could also reduce annual water evaporation by 106 km3. If the reservoir area coverage is reduced to 20% or 10%, the FPV annual generation would be 7,113 TWh or 4,356 TWh, respectively.
“Globally, the highest regional potential tends to be concentrated in parts of the United States, eastern Brazil, Portugal, Spain, northern South Africa, Zimbabwe, India, and eastern China,” the scientists said.
The results also show that 40 countries have higher FPV potential than current annual electricity demand, with Brazil’s enormous 538 TWh per year of electricity demand being fully met by potential FPV generation of 865 TWh per year. Zimbabwe, Laos, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Myanmar, and Sudan have considerably higher FPV electricity potential than current demand, according to the study.
The results for the top 20 countries for floating solar potential are as follows:
“Achieving this vision will require addressing lingering problems related to policy, planning, financing, regulation, technological support, and construction/maintenance,” said the scientists.
They shared their findings in “Energy production and water savings from floating solar photovoltaics on global reservoirs,” which was recently published in Nature Sustainability.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/21/pv-expo-2023-japanese-solars-struggle-for-space/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,ASIA,JAPAN",MARK HUTCHINS,"MARCH 21, 2023",PV Expo 2023: Japanese solar’s struggle for space,"Spread across three days, Japan’s Smart Energy Week again brought several thousand visitors to Tokyo Big Sight. Domestic companies were a relatively rare sight on the show floor, particularly in the PV Expo hall. But large crowds and a wealth of new innovations on display throughout the PV, battery, smart grid, and hydrogen exhibitions gave plenty to be optimistic about.
Solar and renewable energy in Japan have often been described as “in a transition period” for the past few years. Solar installations have remained at a steady 5 GW to 6 GW per year, while dwindling feed-in tariff rates and a shortage of suitable land for new large-scale PV installations have led many to ask what’s next for Japan.
The country is working towards a target of at least 36% to 38% renewables in its energy mix by 2030. An opening day presentation by Kazuya Inoue, director of climate change policy at Japan’s Ministry of Energy (MoE), noted that this would require at least a doubling of Japan’s cumulative solar capacity, and a significant uptick in installations during the second half of this decade. Inoue stated that the MoE is “committed to solar,” and its calculations show that renewable energy sources could meet at least 1.8 times Japan’s total electricity demand – meaning much is still not being exploited. And in response to this, MoE will make JPY 20 trillion ($151 billion) of funding available for various renewable energy, energy storage, and decarbonization projects up to 2030.
With little suitable land left for large-scale PV, Japan’s PV policy is switching focus to rooftop and commercial PV models. Many companies in Japan have set decarbonization targets for themselves and are looking to clean up their energy supply through solar PPAs. Tokyo based analysts RTS Corp. explained that high energy prices along with subsidies available for solar PPA installations make this a particularly attractive model at the moment.
RTS also said it expects to see Japan’s market for ground-mount solar installations shrink as residential PV grows. It noted that experimental schemes requiring solar on all new buildings are being tried out in the Tokyo and Kawasaki regions, and will likely be rolled out further in the near future.
Japan has also seen a few early installations combining solar and farmland, but opinions are divided as to whether this agrivoltaics approach will work as a solution to shortages of land for solar projects. According to RTS, agrivoltaics in Japan will likely see some growth in the years leading to 2030, but some local agricultural committees are not well prepared, and widespread reform of land-use regulations will be needed for a real market to develop.
No more PERC?
China’s cell and module producers dominated much of the PV Expo hall, and were keen to demonstrate their latest products in a market traditionally keen on the latest technologies. Every one of these companies said plans are already well underway to stop producing PERC cells completely by the end of 2024, or even sooner.
And all of the replacements were on display this week, most are taking the simplest route of upgrading to TOPCon to reach higher efficiencies. Trina Solar and JinkoSolar were among companies confirming plans to stop producing PERC entirely. And DAS Solar, which operates 30 GW of TOPCon cell capacity and plans to expand to 40 GW this years, told pv magazine this “is only beginning for TOPCon,” with expectations to reach 26% production cell efficiency in 2024.
Others, however, are looking further into the future and at even higher performance levels that could be achieved with heterojunction and back contact technologies. Manufacturers Huasun and Risen demonstrated their latest heterojunction products, with the former aiming at average production cell efficiencies better than 25% and planning to expand its capacity to 40 GW by 2025.
Longi Solar also had it latest hybrid passivated back contact products on show, and Aiko Solar showed off its latest All-Back-Contact, which its rolling out products for the rooftop market this year and expects to be able to reduce costs sufficiently for the large-scale segment over the next few years, as well as achieving better than 27% module efficiency.
Electronics giant Sharp – seemingly the only Japanese company exhibiting any type of PV module at this year’s show – demonstrated its multi-junction gallium-arsenide based cell, which hits more than 30% efficiency. Currently at more than 100 times the cost of a typical silicon cell, there’s a long way to go before this will be attractive for powering anything other than space travel. Nonetheless, the company exhibited a Toyota car covered with these cells, adding up to an impressive 860 W of solar on the vehicle body, which the company says can power a journey of up to 50 km with no other charging.
Sharp also says it is working with the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) to bring the cost of these cells down to earth. They are developing a reusable substrate and larger-scale processes to cut more than one-third off the total costs, but don’t expect to see them on a rooftop anytime soon.

Japan, like many other markets with a growing share of renewable energy, has realized that it will need to do major work on its electricity networks in order to deliver all this clean energy when and where it’s needed. And the Smart-Grid expo was one place where well-known Japanese brands were more able to shine. Mitsubishi Electric had a range of software on show, demsonstrating that it is able to manage large electricity networks by combining data from multiple small installations into a virtual power plant.
Sharp, as well as Chinese companies Growatt and Sungrow, also exhibited electric vehicle chargers and previewed vehicle-to- grid and vehicle-to-home approaches, where the car’s battery while plugged in is used to maximize consumption of solar electricity from a rooftop installation, or many are linked together to scale this up to a whole region. This is an approach these companies expect to gain a lot of traction in Japan over the coming years, on the residential side, in particular.

Image: Astrasun Solar
A nation with only 26 MW of solar in 2016 added more than a gigawatt last year and the 2030 National Energy Strategy target of having 6 GW of solar may be reached within five years.
These figures demonstrate significant demand for clean, affordable solar energy but the rapid expansion of PV has outpaced the ability of an under-developed national grid to keep up, with ramifications for regulation, a slowing in energy investment and even falls in the value of the forint.
The Hungarian operation of German energy company E.ON in January announced plans for a €190 million ($201 million) investment into its grid network, partly financed by the EU, to open up 700 MW of grid capacity by 2026. State-owned peer MVM Group and Swiss-owned gas company Opus Titász have announced HUF 96.6 billion ($258 million) of grid investment plans.
Despite those developments, contradictory policy and regulation clouds the outlook for Hungarian solar.
In April 2021, the lack of network capacity prompted a ban on licences for solar plants above 50 kW in scale. Below that size, grid-connected household self-consumption arrays were permitted and industrial arrays can still be approved, albeit for self-consumption only and often requiring energy storage.
Solar ban
In May, national transmission system operator (TSO) Magyar Villamosenergia-Ipari Atviteli Rendszeriranyito (Mavir) announced there is no free grid capacity to back tenders. That means new solar plants can only be permitted via a “unique procedure,” under which the TSO issues specific conditions for eligibility, usually requiring developers to fund any necessary grid infrastructure. Even then, eligible projects must fulfill “exemption conditions” which lack transparency.
In October, the Hungarian government introduced a provision for small, household-sized solar power plants that fundamentally transformed the Hungarian solar market. Since Oct. 31, the aforementioned, sub-50 kW, grid-connected household systems could no longer have a grid connection and could only be used for self-consumption.
That effectively means such systems will only have value if paired with energy storage. The inevitable impact on the market prompted the Ministry of Energy to state, in early February, that it will review the “small-scale solar panel stop” measure.
EU gridlock
Hungary, of course, is not the only nation to experience grid capacity shortages caused by the rapid emergence of renewable energy generation – similar problems have occurred in Germany and Romania – the unpredictable, at times ad hoc nature of Hungarian energy regulation indicates the market is under intense scrutiny in Budapest.
The EU could play a significant part in helping prepare the Hungarian grid for more renewables capacity by resolving its dispute with Viktor Orbán’s government and releasing the funds approved for allocation to the country under the bloc’s Covid recovery fund.
The devastating effects of climate change on the environment, as well as the economic and geopolitical events of recent years, have demonstrated that green energy is clearly the path to a sustainable future. More particularly, they have illustrated that, in the long run, only a diversified energy mix can provide national energy security.
The government has moved to address this with pro-solar and energy-efficiency subsidies. In September, the second phase of an EU-financed HUF 201 billion solar and heating modernization fund was launched. Under the program, families with less than the national average income can claim a non-repayable grant of up to HUF 2.9 million to install solar, plus up to HUF 11.3 million to add a heat pump, energy storage, and replace windows and doors. The fund was intended to cover all such costs but high inflation has meant the grant does not reach 100% of costs, even if it remains popular.
A separate home renovation grant offers families with, or expecting, a child up to HUF 3 million to cover half the cost of works and can include solar expenses provided they are no more than HUF 450,000 per kilowatt of generation capacity installed.
In addition, members of the Hungarian cabinet have indicated a willingness to back solar plants up to 800 MW in scale.
Manufacturing
To supercharge Hungarian solar, in addition to network investment and clearer regulation, the nation needs local manufacturing. My company, Astrasun Solar, has signed an agreement with Hungarian conglomerate Műszertechnika-Holding and its vehicle-chassis manufacturing operation IK Metál to produce solar mounting structures.
While the European Union’s REPowerEU initiative, unveiled in May, aims to wean the bloc off Russian gas with the help of a solar energy strategy, the plan fails to address the market’s dependence on solar imports from China.
As the strategy stipulates, the EU primarily aims to increase its 35 GW of annual solar panel module assembly capacity. Insufficient attention has been paid to the fact Europe has only a gigawatt of solar ingot and wafer production lines – the basis of solar panel manufacturing. The China Photovoltaic Industry Association has estimated the country boasted more than 98% of global ingot and wafer manufacture in 2021.
State support
The EU strategy should be aiming for at least a 20% to 40% expansion in European silicon production and ingot manufacturing capacity. With those operations exceedingly energy intensive, there would be a need for long-term, low-price, fixed state support for the electricity supply to manufacturers. These details should have been worked out long ago.
There is room for development in solar strategy in both Hungary and Europe and progress could be unlocked by social and professional dialogue to resolve contradictions and strengthen vulnerable points of the market.
More stable, predictable solar policy could open the way for a perfectly-located Hungarian PV market and for its companies to play a leading role on the European scene.

The funding for the ‘Clean Heat Streets’ project was allocated through the Net Zero Innovation Portfolio (NZIP), part of the UK government’s “Heat Pump Ready” program.
“The two Samsung air source heat pumps being offered to residents are the Samsung EHS Monobloc and the Samsung EHS HT Quiet,” a Samsung spokesperson told pv magazine. The EHS Monobloc has a heating and cooling capacity of 5 kW and a coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.85 at 35 C, and 2.83 at 55 C. The EHS HT Quiet has a heating and cooling capacity ranging from 8 kW to 14 kW, and a coefficient of performance ranging from 5 to 5.05 at 35 C. Both solutions use R32 as the refrigerant.
“The selection of the heat pump for each house will follow the usual process of heat loss calculation, specification, and design to ensure that the correct heat pump output is chosen for each house. Alto Energy, the installer partner on this project, will work to ensure this,” said the Samsung spokesperson.
The Clean Heat Streets project will explore whether heat pump installations would be quicker, cheaper, and easier for both suppliers and residents when installed on a street-by-street basis. It will also test how a large number of heat pumps can be installed within a particular area without causing very high peaks in demand for electricity on winter evenings, for example. The heat pumps will be connected to two electrical substations in Rose Hill, at Courtland Road and Fiennes Road.
“The innovative project ultimately aims to create a more streamlined approach to installations through establishing a network of skilled installers, as well as saving time, money, and resources – all of which are key barriers when trying to install heat pump technology,” Oxford City Council said in a statement.
According to the council, a heat pump installation can cost between GBP 7,000 and GBP 13,000. The project will lower the cost of the cheapest heat pump to approximately GBP 2,600, the council said, adding that owned, private-rented, and social housing will all be targeted.
The ‘Clean Heat Streets’ project builds on the work of a six-month feasibility study that developed an energy mapping approach to identify suitable homes for installing heat pumps and explored the key barriers to heat pump uptake in Rose Hill. It is looking for households from around the Rose Hill area to participate in the project. More information can be found here.
Oxford Brookes University, Oxfordshire County Council, Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN), GenGame, and Passiv UK are also part of the consortium.

French startup SolarinBlue has launched the first two units of an offshore solar plant demonstrator near Sète-Frontignan,  France.
Antoine Retailleau, the company's co-founder and operational director, said the project is the first of its kind in France.
“When it will be completed in 2024, the pilot called Sun'Sète will include a total of 25 floating units for a power of 300 kW, on an area of 5,000 m2,” he told pv magazine France. It will be anchored 1.5 kilometers from the coast, at the site of the former offshore hydrocarbon unloading station, where the water depth is 15 meters.
The floats were specially designed in-house to withstand high seas. The modules are 12 meters long and wide and can accommodate 20 solar panels, with a combined power of approximately 10 kW. The panels are installed at a height of 3.5 meters.
Recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) floats and treated steel lattice frame ensure the buoyancy of the structure, which can withstand 12-meter dips and 200 kmh winds, according to the company.
“The units can be interconnected to create MW islands which themselves can be grouped together to form solar parks with a power of up to 1 GW,” said Aurélien Croq, development director for SolarinBlue.
The researchers worked to minimize the environmental impact of the anchor.
“We have developed a system of helical anchors, combined with a tensioned anchor in synthetic lines,” said Croq. “This solution provides two benefits. Firstly, it occupies a very small surface area on the ground, less than 1 square meter, and secondly, it works with a taut line that preserves the seabed because there is no dredging of the area with a chain. Finally, the device is fully reversible as all you have to do is unscrew the screw when dismantling the structure.”
The floating solar power plant will be connected to the port's grid via an undersea cable to be installed at the end of 2023. It will supply power to the infrastructure of the port of Sète-Frontignan.
SolarinBlue says it aims to position itself within three years as a world leader in floating offshore solar photovoltaics. It aims to cover the entire value chain, from technological development to the operation of floating PV projects.
“We are considering two areas of growth: the development of our own solution, in line with our financial capacities, and the supply of the solution to EPC companies or developers for greater powers,” said Retailleau.

Perovskite cells built with 2D hybrid materials are generally more stable than conventional, 3D devices, due to the protection provided by the organic ligands. They usually exhibit large exciton binding energies.
“This work has achieved the orientation control of polycrystalline perovskite thin films for the first time, and prepared the high-quality perovskite thin films and high-efficiency devices with orientation,” researcher Zhike Liu told pv magazine.
The academics built the cell with a 2D/3D heterojunction architecture. The device features a substrate made of tin oxide (FTO), a titanium oxide (TiO2) electron transport layer, a perovskite layer deposited on diaminobenzidine (DAB) film via spin coating, a spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer, and a metal contact.
The researchers said the DAB film can modify the morphology of the perovskite films.
“DAB modification on the bottom and top surfaces of the perovskite film can significantly passivate and reduce defects, thus reducing nonradiative recombination loss in the perovskite film,” they explained.
The solar cell has a power conversion efficiency of 24.83%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.19 V, a short-circuit current of 25.21 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 82.61%.
“The unencapsulated devices maintain 95% and 89% of their initial efficiency after storing in ambient air for 1,650 hours or heating at 85 C for 500 hours, respectively, and the encapsulated device sustains 88% of its initial PCE after MPP tracking for 200 h under continuous illumination,” said the Chinese group.
They presented the cell in “Orientation Engineering via 2D Seeding for Stable 24.83% Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.
“This article has a good reference value for controlling other orientations of perovskite and promoting the commercialization process of high-efficiency perovskite cells,” said Liu.

India's MNRE says solar projects commissioned by March 31, 2024, will not have to source PV modules from the Approved Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) list.
Imported module costs remain competitive compared to panels sourced from domestic manufacturers using imported solar PV cells. Prices of mono PERC modules have moderated over the past five to six months, falling from a peak in December 2022, says ICRA. 
Domestic module manufacturing capacity in India has jumped significantly over the last two years. While this is positive for the solar power sector, a lack of backward integration and limited capacity for cell manufacturing are keeping module manufacturers dependent on imported PV cells.

The ReVolve battery energy storage product, which uses second-life Nissan Leaf electric vehicle (EV) battery packs, features Relectrify’s patented cell-level control technology, which combines an integrated battery management system (BMS) and inverter hardware solution. The hybrid system replaces conventional BMS and inverters with a single electronic solution that allows for the control of individual cells to generate grid-compliant alternating current (AC) directly from a battery pack.
Melbourne-based Relectrify said the IEC certification marks the first time a commercial and industrial-scale energy storage product using cell-level control has been certified to the internationally recognised IEC standards. The company said it is also the first stationary battery energy storage product using repurposed second-life EV batteries to be certified for on-grid deployment in Australia.
Relectrify Chief Executive Officer Valentin Muenzel said the certifications prove that the company’s technology can work safely and in accordance with global technology standards, clearing the way for the company to supply the technology for grid interactive operation in the surging European and the United States (US) energy storage markets.
“The ReVolve demonstrates that our BMS+Inverter technology meets performance, safety, and grid compliance needs, supporting the technology’s integration in collaborative projects with leading global battery companies for residential, industrial and grid-scale applications,” said Muenzel.
Relectrify says the combined inverter and battery management technology revolutionizes battery storage, increasing the cycle life of a lithium-ion battery by as much as one-third, and reducing power electronic costs by up to 30% compared to traditional battery systems.
The technology, which can be used in residential, industrial and grid storage systems, with new or second-life batteries, has already been tested in numerous technical pilot projects around the world. Counties Energy Group Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer Moonis Vegdani said the distribution network owner will now expand its rollout of Relectrify’s storage technology to assist it with the integration of distributed energy resources in a safer, less expensive, and time efficient way.
“As an early adopter of Relectrify’s BMS+Inverter technology in a pilot program for a network scale battery system, we are thrilled to see that the Relectrify team has gained certification for grid connection,” he said. “We look forward to bringing this technology to New Zealand this year.”
The IEC certification comes just weeks after Relectrify secured financial backing from a group of major international companies, including the venture capital unit of Japanese automaker Toyota.

EnergyBin, a website for selling solar hardware, has released its second annual PV Module Price Index for the Secondary Solar Market. The index tracks the price of new and used solar modules listed for sale.
EnergyBin does not take commissions on module sales or track actual final sales, so its figures only track listed prices, rather than actual sales. The group lists solar components from more than 500 companies that have registered on its website. From January 2020 to December 2022, it listed 3.6 million modules with a total capacity of 1.35 GW.
Since January 2020, solar module prices on EnergyBin have increased across all classes. Prices increased until January 2022, held near that peak for around six months, and then steadily decreased throughout the rest of the year.
Solar module pricing has not returned to the lows seen in 2020 and early 2021. And due to growing demand, US import challenges, and polysilicon shortages, module prices mirrored those seen in the general marketplace in 2021 and 2022.
Starting with 2021 polysilicon shortages due to factory fires, then buoyed by major growth, polysilicon prices increased by more than 200%. This broke the decade-long price decrease streak of solar modules. Among the many advances in that period, the effective price per watt of polysilicon fell by 96%. Later in 2022, aligned with the EnergyBin price decrease, we started to see the price of polysilicon fall, before bottoming out in January. It is projected that we will see further solar panel price relief, due to massive industry scaling going forward.
EnergyBin has found that the volume of available modules tends to peak during the first and fourth quarters of the year, and decreases in the second and third quarters. BayWa r.e., GoodFaith Energy, and Inovateus Solar are a few EnergyBin users listed on the website.
In 2022, used solar panels represented approximately 9% of all modules listed on EnergyBin’s website, and prices fluctuated from $0.095/W to $0.197/W. EnergyBin observed that at one point during the year, a single project contributed a 27.5 MW volume of used modules, which increased the percentage of used solar modules on the website from 4% to 9%.
EnergyBin says that used modules cost 50% to 80% of what new products cost. Some of the larger solar distributors and re-distributors can be found on the website, along with local shops stocking smaller quantities.
