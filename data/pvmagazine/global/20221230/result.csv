In 2022, improvements and refinements to the process are harder won. And as boom times prevail, the inverter industry continues to grow.
Yet 2022 wasn't a story of easy times despite demand. Supply chains still failed to keep pace, with most inverter manufacturers unable to cut down lead times to anywhere near pre-pandemic timeframes. Things are said to be improving in 2023, but choke points remain for key components including insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and advanced chips. And that story leads us to identifying some of the bigger trends throughout the year in inverters.
S-curve stalls
PV inverters are facing a typical late-cycle in a technology or innovation S-curve, where current technologies are mature, rapid improvements in DC-AC inverter technology have been made, and new gains are harder won.

At the opposite end of this typical S-curve is the hydrogen market, which is seeing rapid advancements in technology and products, with new gains easier to achieve through scale and investment.
However, PV inverters are arguably some way off reaching the tipping point of diminishing returns, thanks to an actively changing market. For example, at the residential and commercial level, many regions are embracing hybrid inverters as default to accommodate battery storage. Other examples include accommodating EV charging and, at some point, vehicle-to-grid solutions, as well as virtual power plant capabilities, smart controls and connectivity, and more. However, the core DC-AC conversion is mature.
All of this was evident in fewer step changes in products: new and better inverters came to market at all classes from a flourishing industry, but marketing departments were forced to work harder to explain benefits outside of raw efficiencies.
Elsewhere, high-power string inverters seen throughout 2020 and 2021 weren’t eclipsed in 2022 by even higher-power offerings, perhaps as weight and sizing limits were met. And, looking towards new technologies, silicon carbide semiconductor PV inverters continue to show considerable opportunity for the industry, but electric vehicles control the demand, costs remain high, and IGBT-powered inverter topologies in solar remain the dominant type.
Manufacturing growth
Inverter manufacturing expanded significantly in 2022, despite the wide economic downturn and tougher conditions for businesses. Enphase committed to adding four to six new manufacturing lines, totaling around 4.8 GW to 7.2 GW of solar microinverter manufacturing capacity in the United States, provided it can secure funding via the production tax credit (PTC) system that is part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Fronius also announced this year it will invest €230 million ($244 million) to expand production in 2023, with Martin Hackl, Global Director Marketing and Sales of the Solar Energy business unit at Fronius International, noting, “photovoltaics are in greater demand than ever before and the demand is exploding as a result.”
Central inverters
The central inverter market blossomed again in 2022 with multiple companies re-invigorating the market. Sungrow introduced a new “1+X” modular central inverter solution to the market, and Gamesa Electric won awards following the launch of its Proteus PV central inverter.
Sungrow’s option offered modularity at 1.1 MW increments up to 8.8 MW to meet the demands of project developers while promising higher energy yields, while Gamesa went for industry-leading efficiency from its Spanish-made inverter, with options scaling up to 4,700 kVA in a compact design.
New string inverters series launched throughout the year, but at utility scale, central inverters were some of the more interesting products entering the market.
Off-grid grows
2022 also saw inverter manufacturers turn niches into larger market opportunities: more off-grid inverters emerged into the market this year, and more inverters were certified to handle both on- and off-grid operation, adding some variation to grid-tie-only solutions. Intriguingly, manufacturers bringing their solutions to Europe and the US had previously established markets in regions like Pakistan, the Philippines, and South Africa, where power outages are more common. In response to both the energy market crisis and climate crisis, know-how from less grid-stable places became more useful.
Rule of thumb
As inverters reach technical maturity and both project and home owners aim for less maintenance and more longevity, 2022 saw some useful studies emerge as a guide to plant life. A study by Bern University of Applied Sciences shows that the performance of most PV inverters and power optimizers remains optimal for up to 15 years, the current industry rule of thumb anyway, after evaluating inverter failure surveys from 1,280 PV systems with 2,151 inverters, finding well-founded fears over inverters left in the causing faster aging.

Upon completion of all construction phases, the installation will feature 8 GW of solar and 300 MW/600 MWh of storage, as well as 4 GW of wind and 4 GW of upgraded coal capacity, according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency.
Three Gorges is building the park in stages, in cooperation with Inner Mongolia’s Mengneng Group. The initial phase involves the construction of 1 GW of solar and corresponding storage capacity, Three Gorges said in a statement. It did not share any details about the expected completion project date.
“The Kubuqi base project is the world's largest wind power photovoltaic base project developed and constructed in desert areas,” said the Chinese state-owned power producer, noting that it will invest CNY 80 billion ($11.5 billion).
The project is one of 22 energy installations that Three Gorges launched this week, with a combined planned capacity of 19.6 GW and a total investment of CNY 101 billion, according to a statement by the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission.

It said the engine reached “Tier 3” in a performance test, which it described as “the highest grade” under the International Maritime Organization's nitrogen oxide rules. “The scope of application of the LNG/hydrogen hybrid engine is not limited to ships,” said the South Korean group. “It is expected to be used in land-based small-scale power generation and distributed generation.”
Japan and Saudi Arabia have agreed to cooperate on carbon recycling technology and the use of hydrogen and ammonia in transportation. The agreements are part of a broader plan that covering a range of sectors, from tourism to gaming. Japanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura also recently visited Oman, where he signed a memorandum of cooperation on carbon recycling technologies, with a focus on hydrogen, ammonia, and methanation. The agreements are part of Japan’s strategy to develop a supply chain of hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives in the Middle East. 
Everfuel has revealed that HySynergy, Europe’s largest electrolyzer, has started hydrogen production. “The hydrogen was produced from the first set of electrolyzer stacks as part of the planned start-up and testing of production equipment at the 20 MW HySynergy facility in Fredericia, Denmark,” said Everfuel. The Danish company expects to start commercial production in the second quarter of 2023, with plans to develop three 100 MW sections by the end of 2025. It will then increase capacity to 1 GW by 2030.
Arkansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma have said that the US Department of Energy has told the HALO Hydrogen Hub, a planned regional hydrogen network, to submit a full application for the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs Program, in order to secure up to $1.25 billion in federal funding.
Air Liquide’s large-scale renewable hydrogen projects, ELYgator and CurtHyl, have secured support from the authorities in the Netherlands. The electrolyzer projects, each with a capacity of 200 MW, will run on renewable electricity to produce around 30,000 tons of renewable hydrogen per year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/30/zimbabwe-announces-incentives-for-1-gw-of-ipp-solar-projects/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ZIMBABWE",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"DECEMBER 30, 2022",Zimbabwe announces incentives for 1 GW of IPP solar projects,"Zimbabwe has announced a government implementation agreement (GIA) to expedite the commissioning of 27 solar IPP installations. The 1 GW of projects range from 5 MW arrays to 100 MW solar parks and will cost about $1 billion in total.
The government has promised to help make the IPP projects bankable. The GIA includes a project development support agreement, a power purchase agreement, and an agreement with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for guaranteed payments of dividends and foreign loan repayments to external investors and lenders.
Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said that the government will guarantee viable power tariffs and PPAs to projects that pass the screening process.
“A key ingredient to the successful implementation of the solar IPPs projects is a bankable government implementation agreement with an economic tariff,” Ncube said in a statement.
The incentives are part of Zimbabwe’s plans to achieve upper middle-income status by 2030, as a diversified, reliable, and affordable electricity mix will be a key factor in achieving that goal, Ncube said. The country aims to generate 1.1 GW of electricity from renewable sources by 2025, but its volatile currency and unattractive tariffs have kept IPP investment at bay.
The announced incentives will be “game changers” for Zimbabwe’s power sector, Mathesha Koko, managing director for South Africa-based IPP Mathesha Energy and a former Eskom CEO, said on Twitter last week.
The current print edition of pv magazine visits Ukraine to examine the extent of damage caused to the nation’s energy infrastructure, including its solar plants, and includes coverage of how PV has been affected in the newly-liberated region of Kherson.
“We are pleased that the government of Zimbabwe has worked in a very coordinated way to implement the necessary government support agreement that will make the independent power projects in Zimbabwe bankable,” he added.
Zimbabwe had 30 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2021, according to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
