It said a record 45 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers were announced in the fourth quarter.
ETH Zurich researchers have found that large-scale, hydrogen-based heating is not a financially viable option in the European Union. “Green hydrogen was shown to be uneconomical due to a large amount of renewable energy infrastructure required,” the team said in “Planetary boundaries assessment of deep decarbonisation options for building heating in the European Union,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management. “The cost driver for hydrogen was generally high-end user costs for local hydrogen storage.” They said the building heating sector can be made sustainable by expanding renewable electricity, combined with heat pumps.
IHI has signed a deal with ACME to study the feasibility of producing and using green ammonia from renewable energy. Japan-based IHI said it will consider green ammonia production projects in Oman, India, the United States, and Egypt, as well as the use of ammonia for decarbonized power generation in Asia and other parts of the world. 
TES and Energie 360° have announced a plan to use existing global energy infrastructure to supply customers with renewable synthetic methane (eNG), which is produced by combining green hydrogen and CO2. “TES wants to supply Energie 360° with eNG produced in regions that have large amounts of renewable energy,” said the two companies. “In return, Energie 360° wants to supply renewable CO2, for example from its own energy plants.”
Hyliko has revealed plans to integrate Toyota's second-generation hydrogen fuel cell modules into heavy-duty trucks for their zero-emission fleet offering. The French startup said it plans to offer all of the main components of an eco-cluster: a fuel cell truck, the supply of green hydrogen, and a leasing and maintenance scheme.

It presented the solution – which reduces the risk of fire and bird droppings – at the Genera trade show this week in Madrid, Spain.
The BirdBlocker features a high-density polyethylene strip with long, interconnected needles. “The strip has needles which lie flush against the roof, making it impossible for birds to get under the solar panel,” BirdBlocker’s founder, Hans de Grooth, told pv magazine. “There is a bridge between the needles so that birds cannot pass between the needles.”
The solution comes in a standard version for pitched rooftops, in addition to another variant with ultra-long needles for solar panels mounted further away from pitched rooftops. The needles of the standard version measure 125 mm and those on the longer version measure 200 mm.
The solution attachs to module frames with stainless steel clips that birds purportedly cannot pry loose. BirdBlocker claims that the clips are adaptable to 98% of standard solar panels. It also offers a special clip for modules with box-design frames.
The company claims that the BirdBlocker is “very easy and fast to install.” The product can be installed without removing the solar panels, and the needles can be cut to the appropriate length for each rooftop. Installation does not require any screws or drills on the panels, so it does not affect panel warranties, according to BirdBlocker.
The manufacturer recommends using its solution for new rooftop installations. Retrofits are also possible, but come at a higher installation cost.

The 2023 edition of the Genera energy trade show was held between Feb. 21 and Feb. 23 in Madrid, with the support of the Spanish Ministry of Environment and the Institute for the Diversification and Saving of Energy (IDAE). The organizer of Genera 2023, Ifema, claimed that this year's event grew “across all parameters.”
It drew 385 direct exhibitors across 18,000 square meters of exhibition space in three halls, up 70% from 2022. The participants included 141 international companies and organizations from 21 countries, including China, Germany, Italy, Turkey, the Netherlands, and Portugal, according to Ifema. Although the event organizer has yet to reveal official visitor data, it claimed that visitor numbers rose by more than 50% from 2022, when more than 25,500 people participated.
Numbers aside, this year's event underscored Spain's position as a key center of value for the PV industry. Genera has practically become a solar fair, and it is no longer primarily focused on energy self-consumption.
After years of absence, a number of big names returned to Genera with their own stands. Many manufacturers of batteries and storage systems participated, in addition to a flourishing ecosystem of secondary and tertiary producers of components of PV projects. The show exhibited all the signs of a mature PV market: cables, alarms, manufacturing lines, packaging, drones for operations and maintenance, robots, cleaning products, and software.
Genera 2023 also served as the stage for a number of important announcements. Iberdrola revealed that it will start manufacturing solar panels in Spain, Trina Solar presented its new series of TOPCon solar panels for rooftops, and Canadian Solar’s Eternalplanet unit unveiled a new residential storage system for the European market.
Market analysts and international consultancies, such as Wood Mackenzie and Pexapark, walked the corridors of Genera. Numerous independent power producdrs and engineering, procurement, and construction contractors were also in attendance.
In addition, a number of Spanish government officials attended the trade show, including Minister for the Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera, Energy Secretary Sara Aagesen, and IDAE Director Joan Groizard. In a short interview, Groizard discussed the state of solar manufacturing in Spain with pv magazine.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/24/catl-offers-big-battery-discounts-amid-looming-lithium-surplus/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,CHINA,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 24, 2023",CATL offers big battery discounts amid looming lithium surplus,"CATL is reportedly offering sharp discounts on battery purchases to its strategic clients, including major Chinese automotive manufacturers such as NIO, Li Auto, Huawei, and ZEEKR. The Chinese battery manufacturer, which produced 37% of the world’s electric-vehicle batteries in 2022, will not offer such discounts to its largest customer, Tesla, which operates a gigafactory in Shanghai.
Based on the proposal, which has yet to be confirmed, OEMs will be able to produce 50% of batteries in their contracts with CATL with battery-grade lithium carbonate, at costs of CNY 200,000/mt ($28.82/kg) per metric ton, provided they agree to source 80% of the battery demand from CATL in the first three years. The remaining 50% of the batteries will be priced at spot market prices.
Comparing to spot market prices of currently around RMB 456,300/mt for lithium hydroxide and RMB 427,750/mt for lithium carbonate, the impact for NMC811 only based on the lithium is around $24.6/kWh, Munich-based consultancy Roland Berger calculates.
“Considering a lower value of scrap in the production and lower markups based on fixed percentage values, we end up at $31.4/kWh. For LFP cells, the respective numbers are $16.5/kWh and $21.2/kWh,” Wolfgang Bernhart, partner at Roland Berger, tells pv magazine “This represents a potential cost advantage of more than 20% compared to spot market prices.”
CATL is able to offer such prices because it secured significant amounts of lithium through direct investments. The list includes CATL’s own mining subsidy, Guizhou Shidai Mining, 8.5% stakes in Pilbara Minerals in Australia, and a 24% stake in AVZ Minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It also includes the acquisition of Sinuowei with access to a 24.9 mt reserve and the joint development of the world’s greatest lithium reserves – the Uyuni and Oruro salt flats in Bolivia – with China Molybdenum (CMOC).
“Once again it becomes clear,” said Bernhart. “Competitiveness of battery cell manufacturers will be decided on the playground of raw material access.”
Price war
Cell manufacturers have been increasingly focused on securing raw materials through either long-term agreements (LTAs) or direct investments. Most of the currently observed LTAs offer price advantages of 5% to 25% compared to spot market prices. Prices are reassessed quarterly based on an agreed formula, but also a few contracts with fixed lithium prices can be observed, according to Roland Berger.
In addition, major cell manufacturers start to vertically integrate into mining and refining projects through direct investments, which gives them the opportunity to source material to a cost basis.
While some industry analysts see CATL’s move as an industry response to the US Inflation Reduction Act, others say that the battery manufacturer is simply passing on the benefits of its longer-term lithium offtake contracts. Either way, this will likely help CATL to retain some of its key customers in China as electric vehicle sales dip and market sentiment for battery materials and EVs turns bearish.
Bearish lithium outlook
Norwegian-based consultancy Rystad Energy says this proposed discount on lithium in the pricing mechanism reflects the oversupplied battery markets in China, with domestic cell production hitting a 60% surplus in 2022. It says the domestic Chinese battery-grade lithium carbonate price was CNY 486,000/t in January 2023, down 18% from the record high of CNY 593,000/t in November 2022. However, the current price is still 40% higher than it was in the same period last year.
It is estimated that the lithium carbonate prices in China will drop by 40% in the fourth quarter from current spot levels. Rystad Energy’s battery cell cost model shows that if the condition for prices of other materials remains unchanged, and battery-grade lithium carbonate price drops to CNY 200,000/MT, then battery cell costs will decline 22.6% and 24.1% for LFP and NMC523 cells. respectively.
By mixing the proposed lithium carbonate price and market price with a 50-50% ratio, battery cell costs will decline 11.3% and 12.2% for LFP and NMC523 cells respectively, Rystad calculates.
“It is probable that CATL’s proposal could cause other cell manufacturers in China to take similar actions in order to secure existing clients,” says Susan Zou, vice president of Rystad Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/24/ethylenediamine-increases-efficiency-of-inverted-perovskite-solar-cell-by-22/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 24, 2023",Ethylenediamine increases efficiency of inverted perovskite solar cell by 22%,"A international group of scientists led the University of Konstanz in Germany has fabricated an inverted perovskite solar cell with a passivation technique utilizing a mixed solvent vapor annealing method based on ethylenediamine (EDA).
“Our work shows how simple passivation can improve both the performance and operational stability of a perovskite solar cell,” researcher Azhar Fakharuddin told pv magazine.
The scientists said EDA has been used in previous research projects to suppress the defect states in different kinds of perovskite.
“It, however, remains unclear as to how the EDA contributes to the morphology, defect passivation and optoelectronic properties of perovskite films,” they said.
They applied their EDA passivation technique via solvent vapor annealing followed by annealing at 90 C for 30 minutes to a film based on a type of lead-halide perovskite known as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). They claimed they were able to achieve enhanced crystallinity and a densely packed film morphology featuring larger grains than a non-passivated reference film.
They annealed the film under a vacuum chamber after spin coating and then placed it in a controlled EDA vapor environment with a concentration of 0.06 wt.%. The EDA interacted with the perovskite surfaces and led to a rearrangement of surface features.
“The 0.06 % EDA passivated films also show a smaller root mean square roughness of 13.7 nm than that of the pristine perovskite films,” said the scientists.
They used the film in a perovskite cell a p-i-n structure and tested its performance under standard illumination conditions. The device has a power conversion efficiency of 20.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.1 mV, a short-circuit current of 24.0 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 79.9%. By way comparison, a reference device without the EDA treatment reached an efficiency of 15.9%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.99 V, a short-circuit current of 20.4 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 73.5%.
“The increase in the open-circuit voltage and the fill factor suggests a suppressed non-radiative recombination and efficient charge extraction in the EDA modified perovskite films,” the researchers said. “The suppression of non-radiative recombination upon EDA passivation is further evidenced through transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements and light intensity dependent (LID) J-V measurements.”
The German team determiend that the EDA modified cell was able to retain 88% of its initial efficiency after 850 hours, while the reference cell's efficiency fell by 66% within 500 hours. They presented the cell tech in “Ethylenediamine vapors-assisted surface passivation of perovskite films for efficient inverted solar cells,” which was recently published in RRL Solar.
*The article has been updated on February 27 to reflect that the cell's open-circuit voltage is 1.1 V.

The declines follow severe  polysilicon shortages in 2021.
Annual polysilicon imports  into China have nearly halved from their peak of 158,918 MT in 2017. They are now close to 2012 levels, when they reached 82,760 MT.
The biggest decline was seen in imports from Japan. In 2021, Sharp offloaded large volumes of polysilicon inventory after the company’s long-term purchase contract with Hemlock Semiconductor expired in 2020. That drove up imports from Japan to a record high of 15,431 MT in 2021. However, in 2022, imports fell by 60% to 6,129 MT.
A similar development occurred in Taiwan, where former producers of solar wafers are still selling polysilicon stocks they own from long-term contracts into China. Imports from Taiwan dropped by 50% from 6,899 MT in 2021 to 3,480 MT in 2022.
The Malaysian polysilicon subsidiary of South Korean chemicals group OCI also exported significantly less to China. Its shipment volumes dropped by 23% from 29,727 MT to 22,944 MT, due to longer-than-expected maintenance work at OCI’s factory.
Imports from Germany’s Wacker, the largest foreign polysilicon supplier to China, fell by 6.3% from 51,316 MT to 48,070 MT. Meanwhile, US-based Hemlock Semiconductor reduced its volumes from 4,811 MT to 2,785 MT, after both polysilicon manufacturers concluded sales contracts with Chinese module maker JinkoSolar, which opened a new wafer factory with a 7 GW wafer facility in Vietnam in early 2022.
Trina Solar is the next major Chinese module maker seeking to move production in response to ongoing anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations in the United States. Trina is expected to open a 6.5 GW wafer manufacturing facility in Vietnam mid-2023.
“With the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act that bans products from Xinjiang and the anti-circumvention decision against solar modules produced with Chinese wafers in Southeast Asia, the United States are driving the demand for solar panels made of polysilicon and wafers not coming from China,” said Bernreuter Research. “At the same time, polysilicon imports into China will shrink further in view of the massive domestic capacity expansion. Consequently, the future of non-Chinese polysilicon feedstock lies outside China.”
Preliminary production estimates shows China’s share of global solar-grade polysilicon output at 88% in 2022, up from 82% in 2021 and 55% in 2017. Driven by the big profits seen in 2022, industry analysts expect existing polysilicon expansion projects to materialize in 2023, with production rapidly increasing toward an eventual surplus.

The Spain-based power electronics manufacturer said the three-phase system has an output of 2.68 MW, or 3.3 MVA, and a DC voltage ranging from 950 V to 1,500 V.
“One of the most outstanding and innovative elements of this equipment is that the power modules are bidirectional, they can be configured as battery chargers or inverters for photovoltaic panels,” Zigor said in a statement. “It can be regulated for different power distributions for battery charging or for energy injection to the grid.”
The ZGR PCS 3300 system reportedly facilitates the integration of renewable energy sources. The company said it reduces grid investment by improving stability and increasing energy generation and demand. It can be configured with 500 kW to 825 kW modules and one to four maximum power point trackers (MPPTs). In addition, it can be adapted into hybrid systems.
“It is compatible with all battery technologies and widely available inverters and chargers can be used as spare parts, which minimizes maintenance costs,” said the manufacturer.
The central inverters have an operational temperature between -30 C to 60 C and can be used in altitudes up to 2,000 meters without derating, and up to 4,000 meters with derating. They measure 2,400 mm x 2,200 mm x 2,800 mm and weigh 5,250 kg. They have an efficiency of 98.9%.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/24/pumped-hydro-key-to-meeting-storage-demand/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",,"FEBRUARY 24, 2023",Pumped hydro key to meeting storage demand,"Large-scale storage is required for energy systems based upon variable solar and wind. But there is already a highly credible, off-the-shelf, low-cost energy storage technology that is unconstrained by material availability, that has been available for a century. It has already been deployed at a scale of 200 GW, and is available at unlimited scale nearly everywhere. This technology is pumped hydro energy storage (PHES).
But there is a twist. Nearly all of the good PHES sites are located away from rivers, for the simple reason that most of the global landscape is not near rivers. The Australian National University’s Global Pumped Hydro Atlas lists 616,000 sites with a combined storage capacity of 23 million GWh, which is about 100 times more than is needed to support a global 100% renewable energy system.
PHES can be readily scaled to any required storage capacity at a known and affordable cost. Future technological development could further reduce the cost of electrochemical electricity storage such as Li-ion batteries. However, existing PHES technology sets a robust upper limit on the cost of storage that is already affordable and highly available in almost every country.
Companies and governments can confidently proceed with terawatt-scale deployment of low-cost, variable solar and wind in the knowledge that at least one highly credible, scalable and affordable energy storage technology already exists. No arm-waving is required about future cost reductions, and there are minimal resource constraints.
Off-river PHES involves pumping water uphill from one reservoir to another at a higher elevation for storage. When power is needed, water is released to flow downhill through turbines, generating electricity on its way to the lower reservoir.
For example, a pair of 100-hectare reservoirs – at an average depth of 20 meters, spaced a few kilometers apart and connected with a tunnel, with an altitude difference of 600 meters – can store 24 GWh of energy. This means the system could supply 1 GW of power for 24 hours.
The reservoirs can be constructed in hilly country, away from any river. Alternatively, existing lakes or reservoirs can be used. Because most sites are away from rivers, there is no need for flood control or new dams. The annual operating cost is low, and the system lifetime is 50 to 100 years. The working fluid is water, rather than electro chemicals.
Hour-by-hour analysis over many years of several countries suggest that about 2 GW of storage for one day (50 GWh of storage energy) per million people is enough to support a 100% renewable energy system in an affluent country, depending on local factors.
The land requirement is very small: in the range of 4 square meters per person. The water requirement is also small, at about 4 litres per day per person for the initial fill. To replace evaporation, the water is cycled up and down hill for 100 years.
In comparison, about 30 square meters of solar panels per person are required to provide each individual with 10 MWh of electricity per year, which is typical of annual electricity requirements in affluent countries.
The Global PHES Atlas lists 616,000 sites that can be panned and zoomed to a resolution of 30 meters. Sites in National Parks are excluded from the atlas. Tunnel routes, dam walls, flooded land, and cost classes (A to E) are shown for each site. Clicking on a site produces pop-ups listing 16 different attributes, including location, head, tunnel length, and volumes of the impounded water.
Image: ISES
The United States has 35,000 good sites with 1.4 million GWh combined storage, mostly in the Rockies, but with a good number in the east as well. The enormous solar and wind potential of Texas can be coupled with local PHES storage to supply solar electricity to the east and west coasts in the middle of the night.

While northern Europe has relatively few sites, there are many good sites in the south. Strong north-south grid interconnections allow wind energy from the north to be exchanged for southern solar energy and PHES storage.

Our Next Energy, Inc. (ONE), announced Aries Grid, a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) utility-scale battery system that can serve as long-duration energy storage.
Founded in 2020 by Apple Inc. veteran Mujeeb Ijaz, ONE was initially known for making batteries for electric vehicles. Earlier this month, ONE announced that it had raised $300 million to fund the first phase of a $1.6 billion U.S.-based battery cell gigafactory. Investors include Fifth Wall, Franklin Templeton, Temasek, and others. The company also received $220 million in grants from the state of Michigan, and Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures was an early investor.
“Energy storage is the key to decarbonizing both mobility and the grid,” said Mujeeb Ijaz, CEO and founder of ONE. “With Aries Grid, ONE is servicing a market demand for safer and more sustainable utility-scale energy storage solutions that are, for the first time, cost competitive with fossil fuels, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act.”
The Michigan factory, which is located in Van Buren Township, will begin production of the Aries Grid LFP cells in 2024, and the cells will be offered in 2-, 3- and 6-MWh options to support modular and scalable renewable energy storage.

The lithium iron energy storage system uses a LFP cathode chemistry, which is known as having a minimized fire risk when compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. ONE also reports that LFP is more durable and has double the lifetime energy throughput of the nickel, cobalt and manganese (NCM) chemistries which make up most commercially available stationary energy storage systems in the United States.
With discharge times ranging from 4 to 12 hours, the company reports that the Aries Grid can create a renewable microgrid that provides 24×7 firm capacity baseload to power factories, data centers and communities.
“Aries Grid offers utilities a versatile grid asset while providing businesses with a tool to help decarbonize their supply chains,” said Dr. Deeana Ahmed, vice president of strategy, policy & sustainability of ONE. “With durable, sustainable, Michigan-built batteries, there is a real path forward to increasing renewable electricity across the U.S. and around the world.”
Since the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law in August, several battery manufacturers have announced plans to set up shop in the United States. Included in the IRA is over $60 billion for domestic manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain, which includes $30 billion in production tax credits to accelerate domestic manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals processing.

Jetion Solar is developing the facility in partnership with German module manufacturer Avancis. The first phase of the construction will require an investment of CNY 1.8 billion. It should be completed in April, with commercial operations scheduled to start in August.
“The HJT technology is nothing new, with Sanyo and then Panasonic having developed and produced the high-efficiency technology over decades,” said Jetion Solar CTO Ewain Guo in August 2021, when the project was first announced. “However, it has remained a high-performance and high-cost product, which limits its mass market penetration. Given the Chinese PV industry’s historic ability to aggressively drive down costs, let’s just wait and see.”
Jetion Solar currently has a production capacity of 2.5 GW for PV modules and 2 GW for solar cells. Last year, it started running a new 1 GW mono PERC cell fab in Tongcheng, in China's Anhui province.
CNBM also operates CIGS production facilities at four different locations, including one in Xuzhou, Jiangsu province. The group was the first of several companies to introduce large-scale CIGS production in China.

The United States has roughly 2 billion parking spots. If 25% of those parking spots were fitted with 2.88 kW (DC) per spot, the capacity would reach 1.44 TW in total. Assuming a lower-than-average generation capacity factor of 15%, due to the sub-optimal angling of the panels, these solarized parking spots would generate 1.89 petawatt-hours (PWh) of electricity. The total electrical consumption of the United States is currently around 4 PWh per year. 
In late 2022, California Senator Josh Becker submitted new legislation to facilitate the installation of solar carports in California via a tax incentive. The SB 49 bill will “provide tax incentives for the construction of solar canopies over large parking lots to boost the local generation of clean electricity in urban and suburban areas, while reducing the need for dedicated land in rural areas and transmission to deliver the clean energy into population centers.” 
Becker said that California’s energy agencies estimate that the state needs about 110 GW of new solar power to meet its 100% clean-energy target by 2045. A Yale University study suggests that carports could meet about one-third of the state’s total electricity demand.
Some US states have already introduced incentives for solar carports, by offsetting the additional costs of steel, installation, and grid connection. These additional costs would normally add as much as $1 per watt versus the price of a typical commercial rooftop installation. The SMART program in Massachusetts, for instance, offers a $0.06/kWh incentive for 20 years for solar canopies.
Built-environment PV projects such as carports and vertical PV arrays on highways are increasingly growing in popularity across Europe. In late 2022, France passed a law that makes solar carports mandatory for all parking lots greater than 1,500 square meters.
