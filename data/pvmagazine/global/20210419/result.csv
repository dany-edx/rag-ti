Advocate-general Henrik Saugmandsgaard Øe had stated a move by the Italian government in 2014 to reduce FIT payments for solar projects conflicted with neither the right to conduct business or to own property guaranteed by the bloc's Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, nor with the EU Energy Charter.
The lawyer was addressing linked complaints made by the Federazione Nazionale Imprese Elettroniche ed Elettrotecniche (ANIE) parent body of Italian renewables association ANIE Rinnovabili, and by solar plant operators led by the Athesia Energy subsidiary of South Tyrolean publisher-cum-energy-company Athesia Group.
The ECJ's judges on Thursday backed that opinion when referring the matter back to the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio, in Italy, to reach a final decision.
Advocate-general Øe's opinion had been reached after input from the European Commission and the governments of Czechia, Germany, Greece and Spain.

Sol Systems said it completed solar energy systems totaling 6.5 MW at seven Walmart stores in California.
The portfolio includes a mixture of solar energy systems installed on rooftops and parking lot carports. The total development cost was around $10 million, and Bank of America served as a tax equity partner. The retail outlets will take all of the energy. Interconnection approvals involved four separate utilities.
The fixed-axis solar arrays will power stores in Burbank, Calexico, North Highlands, Perris, Placerville, Sacramento, and Wasco. The portfolio was developed by Sol Customer Solutions, a unit of Sol Systems, a joint-venture with global infrastructure investment firm Capital Dynamics. REC was the construction subcontractor. Trina supplied the modules and the inverters were sourced from CPS.
The projects began construction in 2020. Sol Systems said it developed and financed more than 200 MW of solar energy last year.

French renewable energy developer Valorem has unveiled a completely autonomous cold room that is powered 100% by photovoltaic energy.
The Cryosolar solution consists of a 20-foot or 40-foot container equipped with a plug-and-play PV system installed on the roof. It has 180 mm thick insulation and 10 to 35 cubic metres of storage with shelves.
The mobile cold room is indicated as ideal for storage solutions in times of crisis such as natural disasters or health crises, especially in isolated areas for the conservation of sensitive products such as agro-food, medical products, and vaccines.
“Beyond its environmental advantage, Cryosolar allows the revitalization of territories, while encouraging the local economy and the economic development of rural areas”, Valorem stated.
In Senegal, two Cryosolar rooms were deployed on fishing docks this year in partnership with the Senegalese Ministry of Fisheries and the National Agency for Renewable Energies. In Guadeloupe, thanks to funding from the French overseas region and from Ademe, the French Agency for Ecological Transition, a cold room was installed on the island of Désirade for the preservation of fish and seafood.
*The article was updated on April 26 to reflect that the name of the Ademe is the French Agency for Ecological Transition.

The model agreement was outlined by Dutch consultancy Ventolines B.V. and follows the introduction of new provisions for the sharing of the same connection point issued by the country's government last year. “Solar parks [which are] under development, in particular, often have difficulties in securing a grid connection and waiting times are long,” Holland Solar explained. “A solution could be to connect to an existing wind farm, and wind farm owners are open to this solution.”
It also specified, however, that solar parks built with project financing may be particularly challenging for the proposed model agreement, adding that lenders and investors are still cautious.
The model agreement considers that both the PV and wind plant owners may negotiate the conditions as if they were starting from zero, including planning, contracting with the grid operator, and building and managing a common infrastructure for the shared connection. “For the time being, the focus is on combining wind and sun but we are also looking ahead to connect production and [the] purchase of green electricity,” said network infrastructure advisor Leon Straathof.
Elisabetta Aarts, director for legal services at Ventolines, said the model agreement was not conceived as a fill-in-the-blanks exercise and that it must, rather, be adapted with an holistic approach to the characteristics of each individual project.
The Netherlands could reach between 38 GW and 125 GW of total installed solar capacity by 2050, according to a recent report by Netbeheer Nederland, the Dutch association of national and regional electricity and gas network operators.
Dutch power company Liander has recently implemented several measures in recent months to increase grid capacity in several Dutch regions afflicted by grid constraints, which are preventing more renewable energy plants from coming online. These include the deployment of two giant transformers and the application of congestion management to a bottleneck in the grid.
In November, Netbeheer Nederland and the Dutch renewable energy associations De Nederlandse Vereniging Duurzame Energie (NVDE) and Holland Solar signed a preliminary agreement to ensure faster and cheaper grid connection of large scale solar power plants to the network.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/19/heterojunction-design-for-26-efficient-copper-bismuth-oxide-thin-film-solar-cell/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BANGLADESH,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 19, 2021",Heterojunction design for 26%-efficient copper bismuth oxide thin-film solar cell,"Researchers at the Pabna University of Science and Technology, in Bangladesh, have simulated a thin-film solar cell based on copper bismuth oxide (CuBi2O4), which is a p-type semiconductor that has been recently identified as a photocathode with a two-dimensional porous heterojunction structure.
“CuBi2O4 is an abundant, inexpensive, and harmless p-type metal oxide semiconductor,” research co-author, Sheikh Rashel Al Ahmed, told pv magazine. “Highly scalable techniques such as magnetron sputtering and spin coating can be used to fabricate high-density p-type CuBi2O4 thin films at a high deposition rate and low cost.”
CuBi2O4 has a high optical absorption coefficient and has, also, the advantage of a having narrow energy bandgap, from 1.4 to 1.8 eV, which the researchers recall, is near the optimum value for solar cell applications.
The proposed cell, described in the study Simulating the performance of a highly efficient CuBi2O4-based thin-film solar cell, published in SN Applied Sciences, has a heterojunction architecture in which the CuBi2O4 material is used as an absorber and n-type cadmium sulfide (CdS) is utilized as a buffer layer. The device also incorporates an aluminum (Al) film, a fluorine-doped tin oxide (SnO2:F or FTO) as a window layer, and a nickel (Ni) layer.
The cell configuration is the following: Al/SnO2:F(FTO)/CdS/CuBi2O4/Ni. The CuBi2O4, CdS, and FTO layers had a thickness of 2.0μm, 0.06μm, and 0.05μm, respectively. “The thickness of the proposed CuBi2O4 solar cell is thin enough, as compared to the similar photovoltaic devices employing other toxic absorber materials, and thus reduces the overall costs of the cell fabrication,” Al Ahmed explained.
In the simulation, the cell was illuminated under AM1.5G solar spectrum with 100 mW/cm2 incident power density. “The efficiency of 26.0% with open-circuit voltage of 0.97 V, short-circuit current density of 31.61 mA/cm2, and fill factor of 84.58% is achieved for the proposed solar cell at the optimum 2.0μm-thick CuBi2O4 absorber layer,” the paper notes.
“The proposed cell design is not tested in a real device but, in the near future, practical production details will come in,” Al Ahmed further explained. “To achieve pertinent insight into the desirable aspect of such devices in practical applications, the numerical investigation of the structural performance, and understanding the physics of solar cells, could be a convenient approach.”
According to him, the numerical modeling techniques could be used to forecast the variations in material properties and furnish important suggestions to change designs and parameters. “Prior to the solar cell fabrication, the device simulations for thin-film heterojunction solar cells are necessary to understand the operation mechanism,” he concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/19/first-solar-claims-lowest-module-degradation-rate-in-the-industry/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 19, 2021",First Solar claims lowest module degradation rate in the industry,"US cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar module manufacturer First Solar has announced that its most powerful products — the Series 6 CuRe panels — have achieved what it claims to be the lowest degradation rate in the PV industry.
The company said the panel degradation rate was 0.2% per year and its temperature coefficient -0.28% per degree Celsius. “This unprecedented degradation rate is up to 60% lower than conventional crystalline silicon (c-Si) products, and ensures that the module will retain at least 92% of its original performance at the end of its 30-year warranty,” it explained, without disclosing whether the results were confirmed by an independent entity.
The panel maker specified the module's increased stability was achieved thanks to its Copper Replacement (CuRe) program, through which it replaced copper with elements from the fifth column of the periodic table (Group V). This group includes elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth.
Copper was removed as it may easily change energy states and diffuse spatially, thus creating a risk of instabilities. The novel doping technology was developed in 2019 in partnership with the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and presented in a study published in nature. The NREL said at the time that elements from the fifth column of the periodic table (Group V), such as antimony or arsenic, were placed onto tellurium crystal sites.
“Series 6 CuRe represents innovation in its truest form,” said First Solar CEO Mark Widmar. “From engineering the atoms in the semiconductor to its ability to withstand extreme weather events such as hailstorms, and from the social license that comes built-in to being able to recycle over 90% of each module, this responsibly-produced technology is packed with innovation designed to address many of our customers’ biggest challenges.”
According to the product sheet, the module is available in six wattages from 450 to 480 W and has a power conversion efficiency ranging from 17.9% to 19.0%. It has a size of 2,024×1,245 mm and a weight of up to 34.9 kg. The open-circuit voltage is between 221.7 and 226.0 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 2.66 to 2.67 A. The maximum system voltage for the module is 1,500 V.
The panels can be used with operating temperatures of between -40°C and 85°C. They come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee.
*The article was amended to specify that the module's efficiency ranges from 17.9% to 19.0%, and not from 19.3% to 19.0%, as we previously reported. It was also changed to reflect that the module weight is 34.9 kg and not 39.4 kg.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/19/green-hydrogen-and-the-cable-pipeline-dilemma/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SINGAPORE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 19, 2021",Green hydrogen and the cable-pipeline dilemma,"A group of scientists from the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore has examined the challenges of bringing green hydrogen to a distant location and whether it is better to transport renewable electricity there via a long-distance electric cable to produce the clean fuel on-site or to first produce it and transport it to the distant location via a gas pipeline.
In the paper “Long-distance renewable hydrogen transmission via cables and pipelines,” recently published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, the researchers assessed the economical feasibility of both options. “The cost only considered the ‘transmission' portion but the upper stream cost is also added as a ‘lump sum,'” research co-author Miao Bin told pv magazine. “So the cost is doorstep hydrogen from a renewable source to energy importer’s terminal.”
The academics started from the assumption that large-scale batteries are still unviable in storing grid electricity and that the capacity factor of renewable energy sources is still incapable of sustaining a stable grid operation.
Analyzing the electric line option, they stressed that the high voltage alternating current (HVAC) cables and the high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines that are usually built for the transport of electricity to distant locations suffer from losses that reach 6.7% and 3.5% per 1000 km, respectively. “The AC cable possesses higher dissipative losses and higher material cost over high voltage and long-distance energy transmission due to the skin effect of the alternating current,” they explained. “The longest power transmission projects are HVDC overhead transmission cables and are mainly located in the continent countries.” In the cost assessment for an HVDC line, they considered the renewable sources, AC transmission lines, an AC to DC converter station, HVDC transmission lines, a DC to AC converter station, and AC transmission and distribution lines.
As for the second option, the research group considered the cost for setting up the power-to-gas facilities, gas buffer storage tanks, compressors, the gas pipeline itself, and receiving infrastructures. “The hydrogen pipeline cost was assumed to be similar to that of natural gas pipelines with an additional 10% increase,” it specified.
The electricity cost is assumed to be $78.67/MWh, which the scientists described as the simple average from solar PV, onshore and offshore wind costs, while the averaged capacity factor is assumed at 32.7%. Power transmission losses for the cable line are estimated at 3.5% per 1000 km and the fugitive emission from the high-pressure gas pipeline is assumed to be between 0.02% and 0.05% per 1000 km per year. One gigawatt of renewable power was assumed to be transmitted in the cable or pipeline.
Their analysis showed that, in general, onshore transport is less expensive than offshore transmissions and that cables are more expensive than pipelines in the offshore option. “For the onshore cases both cable and pipeline have similar costs at 4000 km transmission distance,” they emphasized. “The cables are relatively maintenance-free and undertaking more transmission loss, which has been reflected in the higher electricity cost terms.” The costs for transporting hydrogen to a distant location for downstream applications such as power generation or town gas usage were defined as too high, as the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of hydrogen was found to be around $10.0/kg. 
Long-distance transport gas pipelines were found to be cheaper than cables, although the latter could benefit from scaling up and higher utilization. “The increase of capacity factor is always beneficial to both cables and pipelines,” the paper notes. For both cables and pipelines transmitting renewable hydrogen, low utilization remains one of the main reasons for the high cost. “Unfortunately, it is challenging to further increase the renewable energy capacity factor beyond 50% in the short-term.”
“From characteristics of the transmission technology, cables have lower cost barrier in terms of per unit gigawatt but the bandwidth is much lower than pipelines,” Bin told pv magazine. “The implementation of which technology highly depends on the exporters/importers long-term strategy based on their future perspective. If the energy supply/purchase agreement is long enough and large enough, pipelines win over the cables.” From the energy carrier’s point of view, electricity is much more popular than hydrogen if it can be supplied stably,” he added. “If the fuel cell age is here, then hydrogen may play a bigger role as chemical energy can be stored easily,” he affirmed. Currently, however, hydrogen prices do not seem to justify immediate action to build huge pipelines or cables. “On the other hand, for cable/pipeline hydrogen, there is another question to answer: which sector is capable of bearing the expensive hydrogen?”
According to another recent study, a research team comprising scientists from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and Spain's Technical University of Madrid sought to establish which form of energy vector between hydrogen transport and high-voltage submarine cables was the most economical solution for energy transport among countries separated by water. According to their findings, the hydrogen shipping alternative does not present very good prospects of applicability in the future, unless some disruptive technological breakthroughs are made.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/19/australian-utility-wants-to-transform-coal-mine-into-pumped-hydro-facility/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"APRIL 19, 2021",Australian coal mine to transform into pumped hydro facility,"From pv magazine Australia
Open-cut coal mining by Muswellbrook Coal began on its Upper Hunter site in 1944. Now owned by Idemitsu Australia Resources (IAR), it is next year scheduled to cease operations in its current form. Energy provider AGL and IAR today announced near completion of a preliminary study into the next phase of the pit’s life — as a pumped-hydro facility.
In July 2019, AGL and Idemitsu signed a memorandum of understanding to investigate the engineering feasibility of the Bells Mountain 250 MW, eight-hour duration pumped-hydro energy storage (PHES) project, after the potential for repurposing the pit was identified by Muswellbrook Shire Council.
Around six gigalitres of water are expected to be stored in the void, and excess renewable energy will be used to pump stored water 2,000 meters up Bell’s Mountain to a new 1.9-gigalitre reservoir yet to be constructed. Water will be released to flow through energy-generating turbines as needed.
With only a month to expected completion, the study so far indicates that the AUD450 million ($348.1 million) project has legs.
IAR Chief Commercial Officer, Chris Walsh, said in a statement, that the results are promising.
Markus Brokhof, Chief Operating Officer at AGL, added, “As we transition to more renewable energy sources, pumped hydro provides a reliable on-demand generation source.” He indicated that AGL views the project as potentially beneficial to both the local community and to Australia’s energy transition.
“Innovative rehabilitation solutions, such as the reuse of mine voids … ensure that sites like Muswellbrook can continue to generate investment and long-term employment,” said Walsh.
The PHES facility is expected to connect to the grid via a nearby 330 kV substation, and Idemitsu plans to reroute water licenses currently applied to coal mining and the running of AGL’s Liddell Power Station, which is scheduled to close in 2023, to fill the void over a period of 18 months.

The project is currently mooted for completion in 2027, and both companies today expressed their intention to proceed to a full feasibility study — including targeted geotechnical drilling, detailed design of the project, securing of environmental approvals, and contractor engagement — when the current study is complete.
AGL’s other plans for transforming electricity generation on its Liddell and Bayswater Power Station sites include pilots for waste-to-energy and solar-thermal plants, under its new entity Prime Co.
The splitting of AGL into the energy-generating company, dubbed Prime Co, and a retail provider of energy and other services temporarily named New AGL, was announced last month. It has been viewed by some as a cynical move to separate the responsibilities of coal-plant closure — unattractive to investors — from a cleaner, more investible entity, in advance of a full demerger.
However, after last month’s investor briefing AGL Chief Executive Brett Redman characterized the companies soon-to-be decommissioned coal plants in the Hunter as the site of an emerging “energy hub … where we are starting to show some of the vision about where we can invest in all sorts of energy-based projects that build into the longer-term future.”
He added that the company is moving to “repurpose the grid connections that we have got as well as the land and the other infrastructure”.
AGL is certainly investing in dispatchable stored energy, although at least one of its planned forays into PHES has recently been shelved: that is, the use of voids at Hillgrove Resources Kanmantoo copper mine in South Australia to construct a 250 MW pumped-hydro facility was terminated in February.
Its other planned energy storage projects, based around fast-response batteries, include a 200 MW grid-scale battery at AGL’s Loy Yang power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, and a 250 MW one-hour-duration battery at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia.
Idemitsu, meanwhile, has coal-mining operations in Queensland and New South Wales which produce a total of around 14 million tonnes of coal per annum, and Walsh says it is investigating additional renewable energy developments and export opportunities via its new subsidiary Idemitsu Renewable Development Australia (IRDA).
In Japan, parent company Idemitsu Kosan, also operates solar, wind and geothermal projects, and commercial fuel-cell-vehicle stations. Walsh says IRDA plans to leverage such global expertise, plus battery storage, to develop renewable power projects across its existing coal sites, and thereby “continue to contribute to regional communities like Muswellbrook”.
Brokhof says that the feasibility study into Bells Mountain, is part of AGL’s “commitment to deliver a mix of technologies to the energy system and aligns with our Climate statement and target of net-zero emissions by 2020”.
