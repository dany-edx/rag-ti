A press release issued by state-owned entities the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA) this morning was framed to suggest the emirate's national aluminum manufacturer was already producing ‘CelestiAL' metal thanks to the 1,013 MW of photovolatic generation capacity already installed at the vast solar field.
“DEWA will supply EGA’s smelter with 560,000 megawatt-hours of solar power yearly from the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, sufficient to make 40,000 tons of aluminum in the first year with the potential for significant expansion,” stated the release. pv magazine contacted DEWA to ascertain if and when the solar electricity began to flow to manufacturing operations without response, but a press release subsequently issued on February 2, 2021 – by the Hill+Knowlton PR agency used by DEWA – named BMW as the first CelestiAL customer and stated: “EGA began production of CelestiAL earlier this month.” A spokesperson for Hill+Knowlton confirmed “this month” referred to January.
The electricity drawn down from the emirati grid is certified as solar under the International Renewable Energy Certification System, according to the utility and the metal company.
The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park is set to achieve 5 GW of photovoltaic and concentrating solar power generation capacity in 2030.
Remarking on the solar-powered aluminum, Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer – managing director and CEO of DEWA and vice chairman of Emirates Global Aluminium – said: “The new achievement contributes to supporting our efforts in reducing carbon emissions through the Dubai Carbon Abatement Strategy. Dubai reduced 22% in carbon emissions in 2019, compared to business as usual. [The] results achieved exceeded the targets set in the Dubai Carbon Abatement Strategy, which aims to reduce carbon emissions by 16% by 2021.”

The European Union-funded Electrification Financing Initiative (ElectriFI) will evenly invest the money between three solar companies, with Tanzanian business Simusolar Inc. among the beneficiaries.
Simusolar is financing affordable solar lights for fisherfolk and water pumps for small scale farmers in its home market and neighboring Uganda and will put the $1.5 million towards its goal of benefiting more than 27,000 smallholders.
French business Sunkofa SAS and French/Beninese business MyJouleBox will also each use €1.5 million of private equity direct investment to develop clean energy solutions in Africa, with Benin the initial focus for both companies.
Sunkofa will use part of the investment to finance 40 mini grids in the nation, together with Florida-based WindGen Power USA, which installs small scale solar and wind facilities in the developing world. The mini-grids project, awarded by U.S. Congress foreign aid agency Millennium Challenge Corporation last summer, is set to begin this year and reach commercial operation within 12 months. Any remaining funds from the ElectriFI cash would go towards other mini-grid developments in sub-Saharan Africa.
The investment in MyJouleBox would be put towards a target of adding 31,000 new electricity connections for 155,000 consumers as it bids to strengthen its market position in Benin ahead of expansion into neighboring Togo and Burkina Faso and regional neighbor Senegal. The French/Beninese business, which has installed renewables generation capacity of 1.3 MWp to date, said it also intends to hire 200 new staff.
Launched in 2015, the €215 million ElectriFI fund has 33 portfolio investments and has devoted more than €60 million to projects in Africa, Asia, and South America.
Each of the newly approved projects falls under ElectriFI's remit, which includes supporting the roll-out of mini-grids, solar home systems, independent power producers, and off-grid renewables plants.

In December, the Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN) increased 23.2% vs. the S&P 500 and the Dow, which both increased 2.6%. The TAN gained 233.6% vs. the S&P 500 and the Dow, which increased by 16.3% and 7.2% in 2020. The top five solar PV stock performers in the U.S. market for December were ReneSola (SOL), Daqo New Energy (DQ), Enphase Energy (ENPH), Canadian Solar (CSIQ), and SunPower (SPWR). They increased by 45%, 42%, 36%, 22% and 21%, respectively. The top five in 2020 were SOL, ENPH, DQ, Sunrun (RUN), Sunworks (SUNW), with gains of 708%, 572%, 460%, 402%, and 310%.
Global demand will remain strong in 2021. Roth Senior Analyst Phil Shen believes there will be 25-30% growth for U.S. residential PV in 2021, given the extension of the 26% ITC for another two years, increasing demand for backup power, and the potential easing of Covid-19 restrictions.
The ITC/PTC extension reduces a potential pull-in of demand in 2021, but supports higher medium-term growth. The extent of growth will be driven in part by how quickly constraints in the system – labor, BOS, inverters, and possibly even modules – can be relieved. Recent ABS issuances have priced in a range of ~2.3-3.2% compared with pre-Covid levels of ~3.5-4.0%. The reduction in rates was due in large part to a decline in base rates, though solar ABS issuances provide some evidence of spread compression.
The industry continues to forecast a glass supply gap of 8-10 GW in 2021, with large-sized glass capacity expected to satisfy only 50-60% of total demand. Prices for polysilicon have bottomed-out and rebounded, increasing ~1% WoW, signaling the end to three consecutive months of slow but steady declines. Driven by planned expansions in wafer capacity, Tier-1 players including Longi, Trina, and Jinko have locked in up to 812k MT of polysilicon supply over the next several years, in anticipation that supply stays largely unchanged up to 2022.

That was one of the notable findings from the Quarterly report on European electricity markets published by the EU.
According to the update, solar generation across the bloc rose a record 7 TWh from July-to-September 2019 to the same period of last year, to supply 8% of the EU's total energy mix, although hydro and wind power still lead the clean energy stats.
Some 2.3 TWh more solar electricity was generated in Spain during the third quarter than in the same period of 2019, helping depress energy prices in Iberia between Covid-19 lockdowns. Germany generated 1.8 TWh more solar power during the period, the Netherlands 800 GWh more and Italy and France 500 GWh more each, with the update noting Poland‘s solar output rose 190% on the figure seen in the third quarter of 2019, to 800 GWh, and Hungarian solar performance rose 73%, year-on-year.
That was not enough to spare Polish power consumers the pain caused by a carbon price which held an average level of more than €27/ton during the three-month window, according to last week's report, thanks to the nation's continuing dependence on coal. The update highlighted that carbon price held firm with the help of statements of intent on carbon emissions by the EU authorities.
Nuclear power was a big loser in a quarter which closed with electricity demand again beginning to retreat as the second wave of Covid-19 began to be evident in Europe. Reactors supplied 23% of Europe's power in the third quarter, with the 28 TWh of electricity generated 16% down on the same period of the previous year. That was largely caused by outages and maintenance overruns but the EU document noted nuclear plants were forced to close in Sweden as renewables drove down the electricity price to very low levels. The update stated hydro and wind were the biggest clean energy contributors in the Nord Pool energy market which includes the Baltic and Nordic nations.
That loss of nuclear prompted a slowdown in the rate of the decarbonization of European electricity that was partly compensated for by a rise in the contribution of all renewables to the energy mix, from 33% in the second quarter to 37%. European clean power peaked at 55% of the mix on a sunny and windy July 5 which saw German renewables supply all electricity demand from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The importance of grid flexibility was emphasized by swings in the wholesale power price during the quarter, with a lack of wind on September 15 seeing the evening peak price hit €189/MWh. At the other end of the scale, the incidence of hours during which power prices went into negative territory rose 133% year on year, to 1,467 such periods. Ireland led the way as its wind power expansion helped it hit negative power prices 51 times in Q3.
The document also noted an historic rise in the number of ‘electrically-chargeable passenger vehicles' registered in the EU during the third quarter. A record 273,000 ‘ECVs' amounted to 10% of the new car market for a 202% year-on-year rise as one in three new cars sold in the third quarter in Sweden came with a plug socket. The market was helped along by supportive electric vehicle policy and incentives, the EU document again noted, except in the case of Denmark, where sales advanced despite a lack of such subsidies.
The copy and headline of this story were amended on 19/01/21 to reflect the 7 TWh third-quarter figure quoted represented an annual rise in output rather than the total solar output in Q3, as previously indicated.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/18/tesla-launches-solar-inverter/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JANUARY 18, 2021",Tesla launches solar inverter,"Tesla has come a step closer to a more comprehensive ecosystem by launching a proprietary solar inverter.
In the last years, multiple inverter companies have ventured into electric vehicle (EV) charging and expanded the power electronic ecosystem, repeatedly emphasizing the inverter's importance at the center of the system. Tesla has gone the other way. Starting with EVs, the carmaker penetrated the residential solar market with panels and batteries but only now has brought an inverter to market.
The product – the Tesla Solar Inverter – comes in 3.8 kW and 7.6 kW versions featuring two and four maximum power point trackers (MPPTs), respectively.
That is slightly above average as most sub-10 kW inverters have just two MPPTs but the product's efficiency is somewhat below the figures achieved by market leaders. Tesla says its solar inverter has 97.5% efficiency, though it does not specify whether that is CEC [California Energy Commission]-weighted or maximum efficiency.
As is mandatory in the U.S., the inverter comes with integrated rapid shutdown capability and provides arc-fault and ground fault protection. The EV maker says the product has been designed to neatly integrate with the Tesla Powerwall battery as well as the Tesla app, which enables the monitoring of power generation and consumption patterns.
Tesla has published select data about the inverter on its website, rather than a full spec sheet. It is also not entirely clear what the app will be capable of in terms of system integration and optimization. As a rule of thumb, the more devices that emerge from a single vendor, the easier it is for software to align them to work in symphony and improve system efficiency and that was a trend seen last year.
The company may also choose to leverage its EV production capacity and power electronics expertise. EV drive trains require DC/DC and DC/AC stages as batteries produce DC power and engines can run only on alternating current. Whether such expertise is transferable to residential solar appliances, and would improve functionality, efficiency or robustness remains to be seen. The 12.5-year warranty offered by the Tesla inverter announcement would hint that at the latter.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/18/japan-pv-auctions-not-a-failure-says-irena/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 18, 2021","Japan PV auctions not a failure, says IRENA","The five solar energy auctions held by the Japanese government between 2017 and January 2020 have been widely described as “disappointing,” partly because the capacity allocations fell below expectations. The procurement exercises also attracted a low number of international developers.
However, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) says that the industry should not see the outcomes of the auctions as completely negative.
“Relatively high auction prices do not necessarily tarnish an auction’s success,” it said in its new “Renewable energy auctions in Japan: Context, design and results” report. “The average awarded prices were close to the cost of electricity for solar PV power in Japan, underscoring the price discovery attributes of auctions.”
Final average prices dropped around 35% from JPY 19.64 ($0.189)/kWh in the first auction in late 2017 to JPY 12.57 ($0.121)/kWh in the exercise that was finalized in January 2020. However, compared to global average prices, which IRENA pegged at around $0.058/kWh in 2018, prices in Japan are still too high.
Land availability
Japan has only allocated 574 MW of solar in the auctions, even though the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has sought to assign 1,663 MW. On one occasion, in the September 2018 auction, no capacity was awarded, as the bids were all above the ceiling price.
“The challenge in solar PV auctions has mainly been in retaining qualified bidders, as many dropped out during the process,” IRENA said. “Developers indicated that constraints regarding grid connection and land availability, as well as strict bond confiscation rules in the first round, reduced their interest in placing bids.”
IRENA said the fourth and fifth auctions were the most promising in terms of final prices and participation by small and new players.
“Indeed, many winners were not established market players, suggesting that experience is not a determining factor in winning an auction in Japan,” the analysts wrote, adding that economies of scale do not seem to have played a major role in the auctions, as the lowest bids came from projects below 2 MW in size.
It is difficult to secure permits for a solar park above 40 MW in size in Japan. There is a long approval process, and this adds to high land costs and grid congestion.
“The prevalence and competitiveness of plants below 2 MW is related to the requirement of appointing a dedicated chief electrical engineer above that project size, which raises costs significantly,” IRENA said, noting that such costs can account for up to 50% of O&M expenditure.
Project costs
The researchers also said that the average cost of a large-scale PV project in Japan stood at around $2,070/kW installed in 2019, which compares to a global average of $995/kW installed.
“Compared to Germany and France, which had total installed costs for new projects in 2019 of USD 899/kW and USD 979/ kW, respectively, the gap is even larger,” they said.
IRENA attributed these higher costs to local preferences for more expensive modules and inverters that are manufactured in Japan.
“Indeed, half of all modules and almost three-quarters of all inverters installed were produced by domestic manufacturers,” IRENA added, noting that local PV component producers are known to sell high-quality products, but not at the lowest available prices.
If economies of scale are achieved, prices of locally PV components will drop. And if international best practices are adopted,  large-scale PV costs could fall by two-thirds by 2030, making solar the cheapest electricity source, IRENA said.
The solar procurement process could be improved with the introduction of auctions specifically tailored to zones, sites, or even projects, IRENA said. This could help overcome the aforementioned grid and land issues.
“Importantly, design elements beyond price must foster the connectivity and co-ordination between the energy sector and the rest of the economy,” IRENA concluded.
The report does not include an analysis of Japan's sixth solar auction, which was held at the end of 2020. In that procurement exercise, METI assigned 368.8 MW of solar, although it had originally planned to award 750 MW. The lowest price offered was JPY 10.00/kWh and the highest JPY 12.0 for an average price of JPY 12.57.

The team claims that the system uses a minimal amount of water.
The system relies on a 140-cm iron pipe with a diameter of 1.5 cm and nine nozzles. The pipe is shaped to avoid shading and the distance between each nozzle is 12 cm. The cooling structure works through different angles of spray by using locking clamps.
“Another specific feature was the ability to set the system on five different distances from the PV panel surface,” the academics said. “The distance between the panel upper edge and the set of nozzles was adjustable from 10 to 50 cm in five different modes (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 cm).”
The system is also based on a solenoid valve and a timer to provide a pulsating water spray, which are both aimed at reducing water consumption.
They tested the technique on an 85 W monocrystalline module with an effective surface of 0.59 m2, at a laboratory in Semnan. July temperatures ranged from 32 C to 37 C, with negligible wind. The water temperature was around 16.5 C. The module surface temperature was measured in both cooling and non-cooling modes for 10 and 20 minutes, respectively.
The scientists tested three different on-off time periods to to identify the optimal amount of needed time to cool the PV panel surface. The pipe was provided with an average water pressure of 4.8 bars, which equals that of the water system of Semnan.
Via an infrared thermometer, the scientists found that the highest module temperature of 64 C was reached by a non-cooled panel. A drop of 40 C occurred with cooling, with the minimum panel temperature reaching 24 C.
“The minimum PV panel temperatures were observed for the lowest nozzles to PV panel distance and the smallest angle 15 degrees,” they explained.
They recorded the lowest increase in yield when the pipe was placed at the highest distance from the PV panel.
They analyzed the system in three modes, with nine, five, and three nozzles. With the first configuration, power yield grew by 19.8%, and with the second and the third setups, it rose by 11.59% and 8.73%. The academics found that a water-spraying frequency of 0.2 Hz offered the best balance between water consumption and PV module performance.
“The maximum increase in PV panel electrical efficiency is 25.86% compared to non-cooled mode, and it occurred at steady water spray cooling with H/L = 0.83 and the spray angle = 15 degrees which they are the lowest nozzles to PV panel distance and spray angle respectively,” the group said.
They said that the main goal of the research project was to investigate the spray angle effect and the distance of nozzles from the PV module.
“It will be important that future research provides the economic approach of this water spraying system,” they concluded.
They presented their findings in “Experimental investigations of spray flow rate and angle in enhancing the performance of PV panels by steady and pulsating water spray system,” which was recently published in Springer Nature.

Peel Renewable Energy has developed a flexible solar-powered microgrid solution in response to the high cost of delivering power to new industrial estates.
The first stage of the company’s demonstration project is at the Peel Business Park, a 1,000-hectare site in semi-rural Nambeelup, Western Australia. It was energized in August 2020 with a grid connection from the South West Interconnected System (SWIS). Full integration of the microgrid’s 1.2 MW ground-mounted solar generation (installed) and 2.5 MWh battery storage system is expected to be completed in early 2021.
Peel Renewable Energy is a subsidiary of Tas Gas, a Tasmanian gas distributor and energy retailer. It was previously part of the Enwave Australia group, which developed the Tonsley District Energy Scheme in Adelaide, South Australia.
Rob Breden, general manager for Peel Renewable Energy in Western Australia, told pv magazine that the traditional approach to developing industrial estates has been to build multimillion-dollar lead-in grid electricity infrastructure. However, the full capacity might not be utilized for many years, until lots are sold and businesses build their facilities and ramp up operations.
“A microgrid approach allows for a more staged and fit-for-purpose deployment of services infrastructure to match the particular objectives of developers,” says Breden.
DevelopmentWA, the land development agency of the Western Australian government, wanted to bring a skilled workforce of the area, which has become the gateway to the Peel agricultural region.
“As part of Transform Peel, and as an innovative industry hub in its own right, Peel Business Park will play a crucial role in supporting economic and employment growth and building resilience within the Peel region for generations to come,” said state Regional Development Minister Alannah MacTiernan in December, when she announced the opening of the first 16 hectares of the site.
Stage 1 of the Peel Business Park is expected to generate 250 ongoing jobs and will contribute AUD 73 million (US$56 million) to the local economy, as it becomes home to the Shire of Murray’s Western Australian Food Innovation Precinct, a variety of local businesses, and the Department of Fire and Emergency Services’ new Bushfire Centre of Excellence which will open on Jan. 25.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/18/new-manufacturing-method-for-kesterite-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 18, 2021",New manufacturing method for kesterite solar cells,"Scientists at Carl von Ossietzky Universität in Oldenburg, Germany, have built a kesterite copper zinc tin selenide (CZTSe) thin-film solar cell by using thin diffusion-barrier layers of silicon oxynitride (SiOxNy) to reduce the thickness of the molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) interface layer.
The researchers said the formation of a MoSe2 layer, with a thickness of up to 1 μm, is usually observed in the Mo/CZTSe back-contact interface during the CZTSe synthesis processes. Similar levels of thickness are seen as having a negative impact on cell performance. SiOxNy is described as a widely used passivation material with high-temperature durability, high oxidation resistance, and low defect density.
They applied two different types of back-contact structures: one with a sublayer of molybdenum and a sublayer of silicon oxynitride (Mo/SiOxNy), and one with two sublayers of molybdenum, and a sublayer of silicon oxynitride (Mo/SiOxNy/Mo.) The Mo layer was deposited by argon plasma, while the SiOxNy layer was deposited from silicon sputter target by mixed argon-dinitrogen-oxygen plasma treatment.
“For the formation of CZTSe absorber, a metallic precursor with a structure of zinc/copper-tin/zinc (Zn/Cu-Sn/Zn) was deposited onto the above-mentioned back contacts by DC-sputtering at room temperature, followed by the annealing with selenium (Se) pellets and tin (Sn) wires in a tube furnace at 530 C for 20 minutes,” the academics explained.
They deposited cadmium sulfide (CdS onto the CZTSe absorbers via a chemical bath. Two layers made of intrinsic zinc oxide (i-ZnO) and aluminum-doped zinc oxide (Al:ZnO) were deposited by radio frequency sputtering as front contacts.
The academics claim that the SiOxNy prevents the strong reaction of molybdenum and selenium from forming MoSe2 during annealing with a high temperature of around 520 C.
“In cases of Mo/SiOxNy/Mo back contacts, the performance of CZTSe solar cells remain unchanged or slightly improved in the range of approximately 11% for the adoption of 10 nm SiOxNy layers,” they said. “As the SiOxNy layers get thicker, the efficiencies of the solar cells decrease much less in comparison to the Mo/SiOxNy cases.”
They described the proposed manufacturing technique in “SiOxNy back-contact barriers for CZTSe thin-film solar cells,” which was recently published in Plos One.
Kesterite solar cells were developed last year by South Korea's Incheon National University and the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, and by India’s SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST) and by Carl von Ossietzky Universität. In August 2018, Australian researchers achieved a 10% efficiency for a cell based on copper zinc tin sulfide, or sulfide kesterite.  The world record for such cells is 12.6%, achieved by Japanese thin-film producer Solar Frontier in 2013.
Kesterite is one of the most promising light absorber material candidates for potential use in lower-cost thin-film solar cells. Kesterites are comprised of common elements, such as copper, tin, zinc and selenium. And unlike copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) compounds, there are no supply bottlenecks expected in the future. However, kesterite is still less efficient than CIGS in mass production.
