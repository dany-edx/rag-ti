The China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association reports a decline in the average polysilicon price in China, reaching CNY 100 ($14.02)/kg, with the lowest price dropping to CNY 80/kg. The association highlights a significant accumulation of polysilicon inventory, resulting in unprecedented sales pressure.
Canadian Solar has commenced trading its shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SEE) Science and Technology Innovation Board, resulting in a surge of over 22% in share value. The company submitted its IPO application in June 2021, cleared the SSE listing evaluation in December, and temporarily halted the IPO in September 2022 due to missing updates. However, Canadian Solar resumed its IPO plans on the SEE in January.
Znshine says it will invest CNY 5 billion in the construction of a 10 GW solar cell factory in Lian Yungang, Jiangsu province. The manufacturing facility will have a capacity of 5 GW for TOPCon solar cells and an additional 5 GW for heterojunction cells.

The Resiliex project, funded by the European Union, aims to demonstrate eight innovative technological solutions for carbon-free silicon production. Two research groups, including scientists from the University of Liege, are involved. One team, Greenmat, focuses on recycling silicon from solar modules for lithium-ion batteries. The second team, known as Gemme, develops technologies to recover silicon and silver from end-of-life panels.
The Si/C powders derived from recycled silicon have the potential to enhance the performance and charging capacity of high-energy batteries, enabling electric vehicles to travel longer distances on a single charge. The researchers also highlight the batteries' suitability for stationary energy storage.
In addition to Recma Group and the Comet Group, which participate in the project, Ghent University researchers assess the environmental impact of new silicon solutions and explore recycling methods to reduce the environmental impact of mining and manufacturing.
The Resilex project, launched in 2022 with funding from HorizonEurope, includes the European PV association SolarPower Europe.

The plants will be operational by the end of the first quarter of 2024.
Meton Energy S.A., a joint venture owned 51% by RWE and 49% by PPC, announced in a press release that it has signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) for three of the five solar farms currently being built. The Greek power utility Heron is the buyer, according to the statement. The press release did not state the capacity of the three PV plants, but it says that the PPAs range from 10 to 12 years and concern about 192 GWh of solar energy per year.
The PPAs mark a new beginning for the Greek energy market, given they are to be developed subsidy-free. This segment of the Greek solar market is still in its infancy. In the initial years of renewable energy development, renewable power plants were remunerated based on feed-in tariffs. Greece later moved to renewable energy remuneration via premium tariffs, set competitively via auctions. But the RWE-PPC joint venture is Greece’s boldest and most mature move towards subsidy-free energy to date.

“The approach for FPV plant assessment is utilized on seven artificial lakes across different regions of Bangladesh,” the scientists stated, noting that the proposed methodology can reportedly be generalized and can be applied to any potential floating PV plant evaluation. “Each plant's viability is extensively assessed in terms of power generation, economic impact, and contribution to the national grid.”
The proposed approach works through the following six steps: 1) Selection of water bodies; 2) Selection of PV panels; 3) Calculation of generated power; 4) Plant design; 5) Economic Analysis; 6) Comparison with ground-mounted PV plants.
The team also specified it took a “conservative approach” as it considered 15% of the total lake area for the floating PV installation. “However, study was also conducted for 20% and 25% of the total area keeping future expansion of the plant in mind,” it added.
In their analysis, the academics considered three water surfaces in the area of the country's capital Dhaka – the Dhanmondi Lake, the Hatirjheel Lake, and the Gulshan Lake. “These are the only man-made water bodies in the capital,” they specified.
They also took into account the Joydia Baor, Bukhbhara Haor, and Barapukuria Lakes located outside Dhaka and said these lakes were recommended by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as potential sites for floating solar.
They used PVGIS-SARAH, a global solar irradiation database, to determine the installed capacity, the required surface, and the panel efficiency of a floating project. They found that, among the three lakes in Dhaka, Hatirjheel Lake has the potential to generate the highest amount of electricity at 19.3 MW and Dhanmondi Lake has the least at 5.1 MW, while the Gulshan Lake may achieve 17.1 MW.
As for the other lakes, they found that the Joydia Baor may deploy a floating PV capacity of 34.30 MW, with Bukhbhara Haor and Barapukuria Lakes reaching 34.07 MW and 17.43 MW, respectively.
“The findings indicate that the proposed plants in Dhaka could meet 1.1% of the city's entire demand, and that those in Kaptai Lake could satisfy 7% of Chattogram, the country's port city,” the scientists emphasized. “In terms of the economic evaluation (LCOE, NPV, and IRR), each of the proposed plants demonstrates project viability following implementation.”
The academics also said that the simulated floating PV plants showed superior generating capabilities compared with ground-mounted PV plants. The latter are said to have the potential to generate 4.0 kWh/m2 to 6.5 kWh/m2 on a daily basis, while floating PV plants may achieve up to 8.3 kWh/m2. “Although the proposed FPV plants initially cost more than inland PV plants, the projected plants have superior generating capabilities and profitability than the inland counterparts,” they concluded.
Furthermore, the researchers found that the levelized cost of energy of floating solar plants located in the seven analyzed lakes may range from $0.0341/kWh (Gulshan) to $0.0486/kWh (Dhanmondi).
Their findings were presented in the study “Techno-economic assessment of power generation potential from floating solar photovoltaic systems in Bangladesh,” published in Heliyon.

Their work analyzed, in particular, 48 solar panels coming from 12 different PV systems. “In each PV system, the stratified random sampling technique was used to select 4 PV modules for testing,” they explained. “All the systems were off-grid connected and installed on rooftops for 5-9 years.”
The scientists decided to keep the manufacturers anonymous and marked the 12 sites with the letters from A to L and said the panel power output ranged from 100 W to 460 W. They conducted a visual inspection based on a checklist developed by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and used a Seaward PV 210-meter automatic I-V Tracer to measure the performance of the panels.
They said none of the PV systems was exposed to shading and that they were all built with the same installation and maintenance practices.
Through the testing, the scientists ascertained that the minimum degradation rate of the analyzed modules was 0.79%/year, while the maximum degradation rate was found to be 1.67%/year. They also found that the modules degraded at different rates with degradation rates between 0.78-1.95%/year with mean and median degradation rates of 1.36%/year and 1.38%/year.
“Overall, PV modules from only one manufacturer degraded less than the warranty rate of 0.8%/year while the modules from the remaining manufacturers degraded more than 1.0%/year,” they stated, noting that 42 modules exceeded the 1.0%/year threshold, which they said means these panels may “fail” before 20 years in operation under outdoor conditions in Kumasi. “Out of the 48 PV modules studied, 6 PV modules representing 12.5% are likely to operate reliably for 20-25 years, with only 4 PV modules representing 8.3% expected to meet the warranty period of 25 years.”
The research group stressed that the solar panels from the manufacturer with the highest mean degradation rate do not necessarily mean that all products from this manufacturer are of lower quality. It also said the degradation rate does not correlate with the age of the modules and that maximum power degradation was mainly attributable to lower short-circuit current.
The academics presented their findings in the paper “Degradation analysis of polycrystalline silicon modules from different manufacturers under the same climatic conditions,” published in Energy Conversion and Management: X. “The results of this study were comparable to the results obtained in the degradation analysis of polycrystalline silicon modules from different manufacturers carried out in other countries,” they concluded.

On the contrary, southern Europe saw more moisture and cloud-bearing low-pressure systems with solar radiation down by as much as 60% of the climatological means for the period.
Solcast data for the month shows that the below-average cloud cover meant above normal irradiation for much of the UK, France, Germany, the Baltics and Scandinavia, with anomalies as high as 30% and 40% above climatological means. Solar assets across Northern Europe will have overperformed on expectations for May.

Southern European weather moves north
The positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) causes weather patterns to move northwards, as the Arctic polar vortex contracts inwards. In a more typical May, a belt of high pressure sits over Spain, France and Italy – causing stable and sunny conditions over southern Europe, with fronts and low pressure bringing clouds and showers to northern Europe.
This May, the belt of high pressure sat much further north – across Scotland Norway and the Baltics – delivering more sunshine to the north, whilst also allowing more low pressure, storms and cloud to form over the Mediterranean.

High pressure brought in moisture from the Atlantic to southern Europe, delivering record levels of precipitation. The abundant rain, coupled with a prolonged period of drought, caused inundations in Spain, Portugal, Slovenia, the Balkans and Italy, where floods killed 13 people.

Absolute values of daily irradiance from Solcast data for Europe in May paint an unfamiliar picture with northern Europe and the Baltics seeing higher levels of irradiance for the month than southern Italy and Greece. This will have driven higher than expected performance from solar assets in northern Europe, whilst the Mediterranean rain and storms depressed solar generation.

Solcast produces these figures via its irradiance forecasting and weather API by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1 to 2 km resolution globally using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.

It plans to hit 10 million metric tons per year by 2030, 20 million tons by 2040, and 50 million metric tons by 2050. The strategy focuses on high-impact uses, cost reduction, and the development of regional networks through collaboration across sectors. The roadmap aligns private and public sectors toward a cleaner energy future and aims to strengthen the country's leadership in the hydrogen sector. President Joseph Biden has signed legislation such as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act to provide funding and incentives for clean hydrogen.
Plug Power has agreed to supply Energy Vault with 8 MW of hydrogen proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells for a community microgrid project, in partnership with Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E). The installation will be the largest of its kind in the United States, claimed Plug Power. The hydrogen fuel cell system will provide power to the city of Calistoga, California, ensuring energy resilience during wildfires and emergencies. The microgrid will combine a short-duration battery system with long-duration storage using fuel cells and green liquid hydrogen.
Hystar has secured its first commercial contract with Polish energy supplier Polenergia, with Norwegian electrolyzer producer to provide a 5 MW PEM electrolyzer for Polenergia's H2HubNS initiative. The project, situated at Polenergia's Nowa Sarzyna Cogeneration Plant in Poland, includes a green hydrogen facility suitable for fuel cell vehicles, along with two refueling stations and supporting infrastructure. Hystar said that it will deliver the systems in 2024.
Solvay and Sapio have joined forces to develop the Hydrogen Valley Rosignano Project, to facilitate the decarbonization of Solvay's operations in Rosignano, Tuscany. The collaboration entails the construction of a green hydrogen production plant, powered by a dedicated 9.5 MW photovoltaic system, scheduled for completion by mid-2026. With a capacity of 756 tons of green hydrogen per year, the plant will specifically cater to on-site peroxide production, said Solvay.

India installed 518 MW of new open-access solar capacity in the first three months of 2023, over 68% up from 308 MW installed in the fourth 2022, according to Mercom India. Installations fell 37% year on year.
Karnataka led with over 55% of capacity additions in the first quarter, followed by Maharashtra (14%) and Tamil Nadu (8%). As of March 2023, the pipeline for open-access solar projects stood at 6.4 GW, with Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Gujarat accounting for over 68% of the pipeline.
Module price reduction and relaxed ALMM mandate led to decreased project costs in in the first quarter, making PPA prices attractive. This, along with C&I entities fulfilling RPO, drove capacity additions.
The cumulative installed solar open-access capacity reached 8.3 GW by March 31, 2023, with Karnataka leading at over 37% and Maharashtra at over 12% of total installations.
“Despite regulatory challenges in many states, open-access solar demand continues from industries and commercial units keen on reducing their energy costs and locking in tariffs for the long term,” said Priya Sanjay, managing director at Mercom India. “With most state discoms raising retail tariffs and the solar project costs declining, we could see growth continuing in the next few quarters.”
The report offers a detailed analysis of the solar open access segment in 17 states, including open-access charges, retail supply tariffs, and market size.

The scientists said the new result improves on the 26.5% efficiency they achieved for the same kind of cell in March.
The device with an active area of 9 cm² has an open-circuit voltage above 1,900 mV, CEA-INES said, noting that the improvement on the device was due, again, to “shading correction.” It did not reveal any additional technical details.

Twin Hills Engineering and Drilling and Water2Wire – a joint venture partnership between international engineering heavyweight GHD, London-headquartered civil engineers Mott MacDonald and Canadian engineering and design firm Stantec – have been awarded the first contracts for the Queensland state government’s AUD 12 billion ($8.06 billion) Pioneer-Burdekin pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) project.
The project is being touted as possibly the largest PHES project in the world. Proposed to be delivered in two stages by 2035, when complete the project is expected to provide 5 GW of generation capacity for 24 hours – equivalent to about half of the Australian state’s peak usage.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the project, forecast to unlock high-quality wind and solar generation sources in the nearby Central and Northern Queensland Renewable Energy Zones, will provide the long-term storage and reliability needed to power Queensland’s clean energy future.
“The project is the cornerstone of the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan,” he said. “This mega pumped hydro project will act like a giant battery, and when connected to our Queensland SuperGrid, will underpin the reliability of our publicly owned grid by storing the energy generated by our renewable energy zones.”
With initial studies indicating there is the potential for stage one of the project to be completed by 2032, Twin Hills Engineering and Drilling has this week been awarded the geotechnical contract, which will form a key part of the exploratory stage for the project.
The six-month shallow drilling program will be used to inform project design, a fundamental part of the project’s Detailed Analytical Report. The report is due to be presented to the Queensland government in 2024.
The awarding of the geotechnical contract comes after the Water2Wire joint venture partnership was appointed to deliver the front-end engineering and design (FEED) for the Pioneer-Burdekin project.
Queensland Hydro, the new publicly owned entity established to oversee the delivery of the state government’s planned pumped hydro projects, said the Water2Wire joint venture will bring significant engineering, hydropower expertise and capability to determine the technical specifications, schedule and cost parameters for the project.
The Water2Wire team has delivered FEED design multiple projects including for Queensland Hydro’s proposed 2 GW Borumba pumped hydro project, Genex’s 250 MW Kidston PHES in north Queensland, the 15 GW Lake Onslow PHES in New Zealand, and the 3 GW Bath County PHES in the United Kingdom.
Queensland Hydro Chief Executive Officer Kieran Cusack said the appointments were an asset to the project.
“Both Twin Hills and Water2Wire had outstanding tender responses that showcased both their impressive capability and strong local links,” he said. “With Water2Wire’s recent work on high-profile projects like Borumba and Kidston and their collective expertise in delivering pumped hydro projects around the world they will be a great asset to this project. We’re also delighted to be working with a local family business employing local workers.”
It is anticipate the project will support more than 3,000 jobs during construction and de Brenni said it will also offer “hundreds of supply chain opportunities. It’s regions like Mackay that are at the centre of this Queensland’s renewable energy transformation – which will unleash new industrial jobs in hydrogen, renewables, manufacturing, and critical minerals.”

This 7.48% plummet – the largest percentage drop so far this year – takes CMM below the psychologically significant level of $0.2/W.
Multiple market players pinned the slump on growing polysilicon capacity in China and how China-made polysilicon is essentially back at what one source calls a “reasonable price.” The latter, which OPIS assesses as China Mono Grade, continued its inexorable march downwards to 107.5 CNY ($15.10)/kg.

China module prices are dropping rapidly, with opening bids for some recent domestic projects all lower than CNY1.5/W, noted multiple sources. Downstream demand is huge, with 48.31 GW installed in the first four months of this year. Yet module shipments are still lower than expected as prospective buyers, expecting further price drops, delay their purchases, sources also concurred. Buyers will wait as long as their project allows them to do so, explained one veteran market observer, adding that he did not expect falling module prices to level off.
OPIS expects significant price volatility ahead as buyers and sellers alike adopt a wait-and-see approach to the China module market’s direction. Pent-up demand from what one source calls “all-time high” procurement, with China’s National Energy Administration approving a third batch of Gigawatt-base power projects, means falling prices could find a floor.
According to the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, the country is set to install up to 120 GW of solar power in 2023. But manufacturers should have big module inventories accumulating, noted another source, which if unleashed on the market may suggest more downslides on the horizon.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

The US solar industry installed 6.1 GW of capacity in the first quarter of 2023, according to the US Solar Market Insight Q2 2023 report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie.
Several factors contributed to the record first quarter, not the least of which was the surge in demand triggered by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. But in addition to the surge, projects are beginning to move forward after being delayed due to supply chain challenges that began during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Wood Mackenzie forecasts that the solar market will triple in size over the next five years, amounting to a total installed solar capacity of 378 GW by 2028.
 
A key component to the IRA is the domestic content adder. In May, the US Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released guidance that provides detailed information about the domestic content bonus under the Inflation Reduction Act. Solar power projects that use domestic content are eligible for the full 30% tax credit can increase their tax credit by an additional 10%, to 40% in total, and 0.3 ¢/kWh for projects that use the Production Tax Credit.
In addition to the tax credits for clean energy developers, the IRA provides incentives for the build out of US manufacturing, and it has effectively stimulated a number of companies to announce the intent to set up domestic manufacturing facilities. The SEIA/Wood Mackenzie report expects that, as a result of the surge in announced manufacturing facilities, domestic module capacity will rise from fewer than 9 GW today to more than 60 GW by 2026. At least 16 GW of module manufacturing facilities are under construction as of the end of first quarter of 2023.
In addition to the domestic content adder, the IRA specifies adders for energy communities and low-income community projects, intending to drive investments in underserved communities.
“As the Inflation Reduction Act begins to flex its muscle and drive demand, the U.S. solar and storage industry is eagerly awaiting further guidance on some of the most impactful pieces of the law,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, the president and CEO of SEIA. “Timely, specific, and workable implementation guidance from the administration will have a major impact on our success in both the near and long-term. This guidance is powerful, and if done correctly, it could unlock new market potential across the country.”
The Q2 Solar Market Insight Report paints a picture of an upward trajectory, but that growth is not without some complexity. First off, navigating the maze of credits within the IRA remains complex and challenging. And secondly, it could take a few years before a full range of US-made soalr materials and components are available. The report points to the fact that there currently is no crystalline silicon cell manufacturing in the United States, although a few manufacturers have announced intentions of doing so, but it will be some time before the facilities are operational.
Michael Parr, executive director of Washington DC-based trade body the Ultra-Low Carbon Solar Alliance, says making polysilicon, wafers, and cells is capital intensive and that is why we are initially seeing so many announcements that are instead about module manufacturing. Any mismatch between US module and cell production capacity would see module makers remain dependent on imported cells for the foreseeable future.
“The US solar industry is slowly starting to see supply chain relief,” said Michelle Davis, head of global solar at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the report. “At the same time, qualifying for the domestic content adder will be a very complex process for solar project developers. Even once crystalline silicon cell manufacturing is established, many other components will need to be produced domestically before projects can qualify.”
The SEIA/Wood Mackenzie report also notes that the IRA rules leave the residential market without clarity because they don’t specify how adders and credits can be applied. However, the residential market grew 30% over the same quarter last year. The report estimates that the residential segment installed 1.6 GW of solar capacity in Q1 2023, and is on track to add 36 GW of solar over the next five years, growing at an average annual rate of 6%.
Looking at the utility-scale market, it rebounded from a difficult 2022 and installed a record 3.8 GW of capacity. The report points to delayed projects moving forward due to fading supply chain challenges as more module importers were able to satisfy the documentation requirements under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).
The commercial market installed a record 391 MW, and is on track for 12% growth in 2023. The only market downturn noted in the report is community solar, which dropped 13%, installing only 212 MW, in large part due to interconnection backlogs.
Overall the solar industry accounted for 54% of all new electricity-generating capacity added to the grid in the first quarter of 2023.

“This transaction not only aligns with President Biden’s PGII initiative, but also advances EXIM’s efforts to promote clean energy exports, strengthen the US-Africa commercial relationship and support U.S. exporters and American workers facing foreign competition,” said EXIM President Reta Jo Lewis.
The projects were initially announced during the G7 summit of 2022 by the government of Angola and the two developers, AfricaGlobal Schaffer and Sun Africa.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the African country had an installed PV capacity of 297 MW at the end of 2022.
By 2025, Angola hopes to reach an access rate of 65% and a total installed capacity of approximately 10 GW. Current installed capacity, however, is only 5.6 GW, although only 4.5 GW is available.
