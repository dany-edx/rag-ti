Industrial production halts will help the authorities to address soaring electricity consumption amid hot weather in the region, to ensure grid security and guarantee power supplies to the general public. Most of Tongwei's polysilicon and cell facilities are in Sichuan province. Last week, the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association said that polysilicon prices will continue to soar due to tight supplies and high demand, and Tongwei's shutdown could have an impact on prices this week.

The subsidies will support self-use refueling stations, under the condition they will remain in operation for at least five years. The province plans to put more than 10,000 hydrogen FCEVs on the road by 2025, with an annual hydrogen supply capacity of more than 100,000 metric tons. Over the next three years, Guangdong plans to build more than 200 hydrogen refueling stations and reduce the retail price of hydrogen to less than CNY 30/kg. The government has said that the “technical level” of  eight key components – stacks, membrane electrodes, bipolar plates, proton exchange membranes, catalysts, carbon paper, air compressors, and hydrogen circulation systems – will be “among the top five in the country.”
Technische Universität Berlin researchers reported in a recent study that crystalline intermetallic nickel silicide (Ni2Si) is a promising precatalyst for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The researchers adopted a one-pot colloidal approach to obtain the nanostructured intermetallic precatalyst. “Subsequently, an anodic-coupled electrosynthesis for the selective oxidation of organic amines (as sacrificial proton donating agents) to value-added organocyanides is established to boost the cathodic reaction,” the researchers wrote in Advanced Energy Materials. They said the activated form of the catalyst generates a geometric current density of 100 mA cm−2 at an overpotential (η100) of 348 mV, displaying long-term durability over a week and high efficiency in paired electrolysis.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will strengthen bilateral cooperation with Canada on climate and energy on a trip to the country next week. “The last stop of the trip, in Stephenville, Newfoundland, will focus on Canada's potential in building a green hydrogen economy. The signing of a hydrogen agreement between Germany and Canada is also planned there,” wrote the German government, noting that Canada's Atlantic provinces have high wind energy potential and are situated on the sea route to Europe.
Southern California Gas has announced that it is working with Ford Motor on a demonstration project to reduce commercial fleet emissions by developing an F-550 Super Duty Hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Truck. “Ford will provide SoCalGas with a F-550 Super Duty Truck to evaluate the prototype truck's performance under real-world conditions,” wrote the California utility. The truck is set for deployment in 2025.
Metgasco has announced the execution of a binding term sheet for a phased investment to acquire Patriot Hydrogen, a developer of modular waste-to-hydrogen production projects. “The decentralized hydrogen production systems turn waste into five high-value revenue streams – syngas (dense hydrogen) for fuel, turbine generated electricity, biochar, carbon credits, and wood vinegar for industrial and agricultural applications,” wrote the Australian petroleum exploration and production company.

Meyer Burger and Norwegian Crystals have signed a binding agreement for the supply of silicon wafers for the former’s cell production in Germany. The companies have not revealed any information on the agreed volume, but they are in talks regarding the expansion of wafer deliveries over the years ahead, guided by Meyer Burger’s growth plans.
Meyer Burger signed the supply contract to make its cell production as strategically independent as possible. It also wants to limit any unwanted dependencies that might affect its PV cell and module manufacturing operations and plans for expansion.
Polysilicon for the wafers is sourced from within Europe and the United States. In Norway, electricity for the polysilicon and wafer production is primarily generated from hydropower facilities. Meyer Burger also notes that its heterojunction/smartwire cell technology can use thinner wafers, and therefore less material per piece, than many other manufacturers – meaning these products will have a low carbon footprint overall.
The Switzerland-based manufacturer wants to build a resilient supply chain and help to revive European PV production across the supply chain. Aside from wafers, Meyer Burger also procures at least a proportion of the process gases and chemicals it uses in its cell and module production from European suppliers.
“With the delivery of first quantities of wafers from European production, Meyer Burger closes the last gap in the strategic re-establishment of a European supply chain for the production of solar cells and solar modules,” said Daniel Menzel, chief operating officer at Meyer Burger.  “Nevertheless, Meyer Burger will continue to balance the benefits of global supply chains, but with clear and unambiguous requirements for social, ecological and economic sustainability.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/16/healing-defects-with-ammonia-for-a-23-21-efficient-perovskite-solar-cell/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 16, 2022",Healing defects with ammonia for a 23.21% efficient perovskite solar cell,"While perovskite solar cells appear well on their way to commercial production, there is still a wealth of different materials and approaches to improve both their performance and long-term stability – and the limit for either of these characteristics is far from being reached.
Much of the earlier research into perovskite solar cells focused on a material called methylammonium as one element of the perovskite layer, and the best performing solar cells made so far have been based on this. Today, however, some scientists are convinced that replacing this with a different material, formamidinium (Fa), can offer a better balance of high efficiency and strong stability.
One approach to improving perovskite solar cell performance is to add a “healing” stage after the film is formed, to help iron out defects left behind in the structure during formation. A method using methylamine gas has shown promise for methylammonium-based films, but is not suitable for those working with Fa. With this in mind, a group of scientists led by the Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology in China set out to better understand the reactions at work during Fa film formation, and to find a suitable healing process to improve it.
Observing the reactions, they were able to calculate that ammonia might have the desired healing effect, and set out to test this theory. “We have shown that the degradation of formamidinium-containing perovskites is caused by a reaction between the formamidinium cation and aliphatic amines, producing ammonia,” explained Wang Xiao, a scientist at Qingdao.
The scientists fabricated the films with the added healing process – noting that a decrease in temperature down to -15 C would be needed to optimize the healing, and used these films to make perovskite solar cells. The best of these cells achieved a conversion efficiency 23.21%, and an efficiency of 22.22% was certified by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The healing method is described in full in “Ammonia for post-healing of formamidinium-based Perovskite films,” which was recently published in Nature Communications. The group is further convinced that its healing process could be applied in large-scale production without disruption to other stages, and also demonstrated a perovskite mini-module with a surface area of 14 square centimeters, which achieved a conversion efficiency of 20.61%.
The group says it will now focus on integrating this process into properly designed equipment that can be integrated into factories and production lines.

A large quantity of solar panels have been detained by US customs under enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).
Philip Shen, the managing director of ROTH Capital Partners, said an industry contact reports that as much as 3 GW have been held since the law has been enacted. As much as 9 GW to 12 GW of solar modules could be prevented from entering the US market by the end of the year, said Shen.
The Xinjiang region of China, which is home to 50% of the global supply of polysilicon, has come under scrutiny for its human rights abuses and the forced labor of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China. Beijing has repeatedly denied allegations of forced labor.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) said developers across the United States plan to install 17.8 GW of capacity this year. However, through six months, only 4.2 GW has been installed and brought online as module supply challenges led to cancellations and delays. Ongoing module supply challenges may continue to hamper deployment.
The UFLPA was passed last December and was first enacted this summer. The law bans all imports from the Chinese region of Xinjiang unless the products are determined to not be connected to forced labor.
To be in compliance with UFLPA, companies must provide a comprehensive supply chain mapping, a complete list of all workers at an entity subject to “rebuttable presumption” that there is a connection to forced labor, and proof that workers were not subject to conditions typical of forced labor practices and are there voluntarily.
“The world and the American people cannot abide the presence of goods made under the exploitative conditions experienced by Uyghur and other ethnic minority groups in its global supply chains,” said US Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/16/total-eren-targets-2-gw-of-solar-1-gw-of-green-hydrogen-in-australia/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,OCEANIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 16, 2022","Total Eren targets 2 GW of solar, 1 GW of green hydrogen in Australia","From pv magazine Australia
The Northern Territory government in Australia has signed an agreement with French renewables developer Total Eren to develop a new gigawatt-scale green hydrogen production facility in Darwin.
The proposed Darwin H2 Hub, to be built on a 4,000-hectare site near the territory's capital, would include more than 2 GW of solar. The PV installation would provide energy for a 1 GW electrolyzer that would produce more than 80,000 tons of hydrogen per year.
NT Chief Minister Natasha Fyles said the Darwin H2 Hub would target both the domestic and international markets.
“With our abundant solar resources and our strategic location to support exports into the Indo-Pacific, the production of green hydrogen is a key opportunity for the territory to address the growing demand for this green energy globally,” she said.
Total Eren Australia’s managing director, Kam Ho, said the partnership reinforced the company’s commitments to invest in Australia and low-carbon energy sources.
“Our plan is to accelerate the development of the project to supply green hydrogen and also the opportunity to provide renewable energy which supports the decarbonization plans for energy-intensive industries in the territory,” he said.
Paris-based Total Eren has more than 3.5 GW of renewable energy assets in operation or under construction throughout the world. It announced its entry into the Australian market in 2018 with the development of the 256 MW Kiamal Solar Farm in Victoria.
Late last year, it added another project to its pipeline, signing a deal with Australian miner Province Resources to progress plans for a massive 8 GW green hydrogen facility in Western Australia. It recently submitted a feasibility study for the HyEnergy green hydrogen export project to the Western Australian government for final review. The study analyzed the annual export of 200,000 tons of green hydrogen to countries in the Asia-Pacific region, with a focus on delivery into Singapore.
Total Eren Chief Executive Officer David Corchia said the green hydrogen projects are part of the company’s ambition to position itself at the forefront of the development of the hydrogen sector.
“Total Eren has made the strategic decision more than two years ago to develop multi-GW wind and solar projects in locations benefiting from exceptional natural resources,” he said. “Those projects will aim at delivering clean and reliable energy sources in the form of hydrogen or its derivatives.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/16/strengthening-consumer-protection-in-the-off-grid-solar-industry/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"AUGUST 16, 2022",Strengthening consumer protection in the off-grid solar industry,"In 2018, GOGLA and its members developed the Consumer Protection Code – the de facto standard for consumer protection in the sector – to ensure that through rapid industry expansion, growth objectives remained fully aligned with consumer interests, so as to protect their rights and safeguard positive impacts. At the time of writing, 85 companies and investors have either made a commitment to, or an endorsement of, the Code – showing that this young and rapidly growing industry cares about its impact and is working hard to ensure consumer risks are minimised.
The Consumer Protection (CP) Code has also been adopted into eligibility requirements for major funding programmes, such as the Energy Access Relief Fund (EARF) and Beyond the Grid Fund for Africa (BGFA), which encourages more companies to incorporate the CP Principles into their modus operandi, and realise the benefits of responsible business growth.
Companies that make a commitment to the CP Code are required to undertake a self-assessment to review their performance against the 37 indicators at least every 12 months, which helps them measure, monitor, and demonstrate their performance – but most importantly, identify gaps and focus on improvements.
Together with companies and investors, we’re now taking it further.
The limitation of the existing self-assessment is that the results are subjective. The self-assessment tool guides companies through a detailed review of their practices against the six Consumer Protection Principles but cannot govern its execution. To combat this, GOGLA encourages companies to include personnel from across the business in an annual self-assessment, use evidence-based reasoning for each indicator, and use the results to inform an action plan for the next year.
Nonetheless, GOGLA has been working over the course of the last year to strengthen the assessment framework and provide additional options for companies and investors that want a more robust and independent look at how they’re doing and what they can do to improve.
For an in-depth, objective assessment of performance against the CP Principles, we’ve developed a Third-Party Assessment scheme and accredited MFR, an experienced ratings agency, to undertake the assessments. To help companies, and the industry, validate how actions are experienced by and affect consumers, we’ve created a consumer protection survey with 60 Decibels, a customer insights and impact measurement company.
The PAYGo industry has some unique challenges. It encompasses a rural, hard to reach customer-base, a dispersed network of agents and employees, and diversity across operational models and technologies. By factoring in these challenges and learning from other industries (e.g., microfinance and mobile money), MFR has successfully developed a methodology for third party assessment that allows for flexibility across organisations, whilst maintaining the rigour of an evidence-based evaluation of practices.
The consumer protection Third-Party Assessments of OGS PAYGo companies conducted so far have identified several strengths (e.g. product quality) as well as opportunities for improvement (e.g. analysis of ability to pay). Scores are given by CP Principle and indicator, so companies can rely on independent and credible results, and track their progress over time. The main goal of the exercise is to improve consumer protection practices, which is done by using the results as the baseline and working with companies to develop an Action Plan to help them upgrade the internal systems and field practices.
The recommendations made in the Action Plan are tailored to the business model of the company, and prioritised based on what is most material for the customers and for the company. They identify areas of work within the company’s internal systems that are likely to have a positive impact on both consumer protection and other risk management systems, in line with the company’s strategy (e.g. reinforcing the alignment between field practices and policies).
It is now an exciting time: the time to improve. OGS companies show high commitment to further develop their systems, and the work led by GOGLA offers practical tools to do it, including the consumer protection Third-Party Assessments. The time to prove will come in future, when the sector and its Consumer protection practices will be more consolidated.
60 Decibels used its knowledge, experience, and passion for the off-grid sector to translate the Consumer Protection Code into survey questions that could be asked of end-users. The objective is to ensure that the customer voice is part of the journey to understanding how the sector is faring in delivering on the Consumer Protection Principles. It delivered Lean Data projects with three OGS companies working in Kenya; using the survey tool to hear customers’ experiences through phone interviews. 895 customers were interviewed in local languages by 60 Decibels’ team of local researchers. From here, the question set was finalised based on the pilot insights, and the Lean Data Consumer Protection Survey is now available for the sector.
Ensuring consumers have an opportunity to share their experience and using this to inform assessments of performance towards delivering on the CP Code is key to maximising positive impact.
An excerpt from the insights: “I would like to request that when a customer pays, [Company] should share a message showing how much balance the customer has. This will even give me the energy to want to clear the balance I have.”
The off-grid solar sector is still young – and should be applauded for how far it’s come since the PAYGo business model was first making headlines. But there is still more to learn. The industry is recovering from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and has returned to growth, but still faces challenges caused by rising costs within the supply chain and price-sensitive customer wallets hit by fierce inflation.
Despite these, we believe that putting consumers first is fundamental to the success of any off-grid solar company. Strengthening the Consumer Protection Code at this time is win-win for consumers, companies and their investors – ensuring that customers are supported in working out what they can afford, receive high quality service, and transparent repayment terms; that companies have effective risk mitigation strategies in place; and that investments are made using robust, objective information.
What’s more, the new services will also enable us to better work together as an industry to further mitigate consumer risks. We’ll be using the insights and results over time to develop industry-benchmarks for performance in consumer protection, helping us understand where the biggest risks and gaps are, and divert technical support and funding to where it is most needed.
For companies that want to take the next step in improving their practices, or investors looking for an evaluation of investee performance and improved risk management, the two new services are available now.
GOGLA is also providing co-funding for the two services to help catalyse insights, improvements and reach more companies. Co-funding is available for companies and investors who wish to support a company within their portfolio – find out more here.

BlackRock has revealed plans to commit more than AUD 1 billion ($703 million) to support the build-out of more than 1 GW of battery storage assets. The acquisition is the first battery storage investment made by BlackRock’s Climate Infrastructure business in the Asia-Pacific region.
Akaysha Energy’s portfolio includes the 150 MW/300 MWh Ulinda Park battery project in west of Brisbane, Queensland. It is also the developer behind the Palmerston Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in Tasmania, which will use grid-forming inverter technology to offer virtual synchronous machine services to the island's network.
Akaysha Energy also plans to deploy a large-scale battery near Wellington, New South Wales. The battery will have a capacity of between 200 MW to 400 MW and provide up to eight hours (1,600 MWh) of energy storage.
Akaysha Energy’s six other projects under development have not yet been made public. Its longer-term plans include developing storage projects in other Asia-Pacific markets, with a near-term focus on Japan and Taiwan. It also plans to add green hydrogen assets to its portfolio.
BlackRock’s co-head of climate infrastructure for the Asia Pacific region, Charlie Reid, said the rollout of storage assets will be particularly critical as coal-fired power stations continue to retire earlier than expected.
“For our clients, we see tremendous long-term growth potential in the development of advanced battery storage assets across Australia and in other Asia-Pacific markets and look forward to working with Akaysha to ensure an orderly transition to a cleaner and secure energy future,” said Reid.

The plans will now be reviewed by the region’s Environmental Assessment service.
The planned location for the project is the commune of Camarones, in Chile’s northern desert region. The project will have a total capacity of 421.9 MW, consisting of more than 700,000 bifacial modules. The plan also includes a 240 MW battery with a five- hour duration. According to the developer, the expected annual generation of 1,100 GWh would make it one of the largest PV installations built in Chile to date.
The project would be Colbún’s first in the region, and is set to be located on approximately 960 hectares of land, in part of a public reserve which the Chilean government has already set aside for the development of renewable energy projects. Energy from the planned project will be injected into the grid via an existing substation. Colbún has already completed several PV projects in Chile, including a 230 MW installation in the district of Diego de Almagro, and two 9 MW projects located in the district’s of Colbún and Tiltil.
The company is also currently constructing an 812 MW wind farm in Taltal district and an 8 MW/32MWh battery in Diego de Almagro, and has already received environmental approvals for the 486 MW Inti Pacha project in Maria Elena Communa, and the 537 MW Jardin Solar project. These are all part of the company’s plan to build almost 4 GW of renewable energy capacity in Chile by 2030.
