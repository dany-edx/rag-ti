France's Ministry of Ecological Transition has reported that around 955 MW of new PV systems were connected to the French grid in the October-December period. The country reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 20.0 GW at the end of December 2023.
Developers deployed around 19.3 GW of the total on the French mainland, and the remaining share in the nation's overseas territories and Corsica.
For all of 2023, the country deployed 3.2 GW of new solar. By comparison, France added 2.68 GW in 2022 and 2.57 GW in 2021. The aggregate capacity of queued solar projects with grid-connection requests now stands at 14 GW.
The aggregate capacity of queued solar projects with grid-connection requests now stands at 22.4 GW, with around 5.8 GW already under preliminary connection agreements.
The regions of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, and Grand Est have accounted for 48% of all newly connected capacity so far this year. They are the regions with the highest installed capacities, representing more than 53% of all cumulative power connected in France by the end of December 2023.

This achievement marks a world first, signifying both road legality and mass production feasibility by GCK Mobility. It said the retrofitted Iveco Crossway NF 80 is road-legal and can be mass-produced.
Forvia and Air Liquide have signed an agreement with China's FAW Jiefang to equip heavy-duty trucks with liquid hydrogen storage systems. They said the deal could help the two French companies to target the Chinese market. “China offers excellent market opportunities, which Forvia and its partners are committed to respond to with cutting-edge hydrogen storage solutions,” said Forvia.  
Ceres and AtkinsRéalis have teamed up to deliver the front-end engineering design (FEED) for a commercial multi-megawatt modularized hydrogen production system based on Ceres' solid oxide technology. “Ceres and AtkinsRéalis' collaboration aims to create a blueprint of the optimum system architecture for a 100 MW-plus electrolyzer system to produce green hydrogen, as a building block for gigawatt-scale plants,” said the UK developer, adding that the collaboration will expedite commercialization.
Singapore‘s authorities plan to incorporate liquid hydrogen as part of the city-state's aviation decarbonization strategy whenever the technology becomes mature and feasible. “Stakeholders in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly taking greater interest in making significant investments into hydrogen, developing new technologies and establishing supply chains,” said Sabine Klauke, chief technology officer for Airbus. The European multinational aerospace corporation, Changi Airport Group, Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), and Linde have been collaborating on hydrogen since February 2022. The collaboration also led to a study suggesting that Singapore's aviation sector could consume up to 50 metric tons of liquid hydrogen per day from the 2040s, and up to 600 metric tons per day beyond 2050.
The February edition of pv magazine considers the ramifications of Dubai’s COP28 climate change summit for solar and asks where the workers will come from to staff the energy transition.

According to the European Heat Pump Association (EHPA), sales across 14 countries, representing 90% of the European market, fell by 5% in 2023 compared to 2022, from 2.77 million to 2.64 million.
The drop in sales was particularly pronounced in Poland (46%), Finland (42%) and Italy (32%). Meanwhile, Germany, which saw sales jump 59%, was also one of six EU countries in which the market grew in 2023 but this was not enough to offset the overall decrease.
In many countries that saw overall growth, quarterly sales declined towards the end of 2023. Market analysts expect this downwards trend to continue way into 2024.
The slowdown is already forcing manufacturers to cut jobs. EHPA calculates that the changes announced so far will impact nearly 3,000 employees.
Heat pump sales in Europe dropped as gas prices fell, interest rates rose, and national policy measures changed. Namely, governments increased support for people investing in heat pumps in 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but much of that support was restricted or removed last year.
On top of that, the EU’s Heat Pump Action Plan, due to be published in early 2024 to support the sector, has been delayed by the European Commission until ‘a time to be decided’.
“The heat pump sector is facing stormy weather and needs all hands on deck,” says Thomas Nowak, EHPA secretary general. “Companies have invested in training and manufacturing capacity and consumers are on board. What’s now vital is a compass in the form of the EU Heat Pump Action Plan and subsequent national plans. These will steady the waters.”
In January, 61 CEOs said in a joint letter to Commission president Ursula von der Leyen that delaying the EU Heat Pump Action Plan threatens EUR 7 billion ($7.6 billion) of planned investments in the sector over the 2022-25 period. “This would affect jobs in the sector; there are over 160,000 already today in Europe, and huge growth possibilities,” the industry leaders said in the letter.
The European Commission has recognized the heat pump sector as critical for Europe’s energy independence under REPowerEU and the Green Deal Industrial Plan. However, it said in December that it was postponing the EU Heat Pump Action Plan – which would set out how it planned to achieve its pledge to install 10 million additional heat pumps by 2027 – until after the European Parliament elections in June.
An email sent from the commission to EHPA in December stated that the action plan would not be released in the “very busy Q1 2024,” but most likely in the”autumn or winter 2024-25.”
According to Eurostat data, about 50% of all energy consumed in the European Commission is used for heating and cooling, and more than 70% still comes from fossil fuels (mostly natural gas). In the residential sector, around 80% of the final energy consumption is used for space and water heating.

The Dungowan Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) project, now under development near Tamworth, New South Wales (NSW), has been acquired by France-headquartered EDF Group from Australian renewable energy developers Mirus Energy and Energy Estate, which will continue their involvement as co-developers.
The Dungowan PHES, located in the New England Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), is proposed to have a capacity of 300 MW for up to 10 hours of duration and will be located downstream of the existing Dungowan Dam.
EDF Australia Chief Executive Officer James Katsikas said the acquisition and joint development of the project demonstrates the company’s commitment to develop critical, clean energy infrastructure in Australia and to work with local communities in doing so.
“We intend to work very closely with the local community,” he said. “Our goal is not only to facilitate clean, renewable energy for the region, but also to foster economic growth and create new opportunities for local businesses and residents.”
The Dungowan PHES project has been in development since 2014 and was awarded pre-investment studies funding by the NSW government under the emerging energy program in 2019.
Mirus Energy founder Mark Waring said the project is indeally located and will help facilitate new wind and solar projects and provide firming and grid support services at a critical point on the Australian National Electricity Market.
“We carefully selected the site for the Dungowan PHES so it could support the development of the wind and solar renewable energy resources in the New England region,” he said. “It is strategically located between retiring coal capacity to the south and wind and solar capacity to the east, west and north. The project is located so it can connect to new transmission infrastructure being developed by EnergyCo or the existing transmission lines.”
Energy Estate co-founder Simon Currie said EDF is the ideal partner to drive the development of the project, noting that it “understands the complexities of developing large-scale pumped hydro projects and we are able to leverage their global resources, capacity and access global supply chains.”
“An accelerated transition of the energy sector in NSW requires new entrants with a track record of successful delivery and a long-term commitment,” he said.
EDF’s acquisition of the project forms part of its long-term plans for Australia with Katsikas saying the company is aiming to develop a portfolio of clean energy projects across multiple states.
“We have rapidly built a development team on the ground in Australia through the first half of 2023 and will continue to grow the team as we accelerate,” he said.

6,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/28/new-design-for-photovoltaic-thermal-panels-mitigates-risk-of-cracking/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,SWEDEN,UNITED KINGDOM,WESTERN EUROPE",LIOR KAHANA,"FEBRUARY 28, 2024",New design for photovoltaic-thermal panels mitigates risk of cracking,"An international research team has proposed a novel photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) module design that purportedly reduces the risks of cracking in the panel's PV unit.
“A critical issue for PVT collectors is cell cracking, mainly caused by thermal expansion during the heat transfer process between PV cells and the thermal absorber,” the group explained. “Due to the high temperatures, these expansions and contractions create small silicon cell flaws, which may result in numerous micro fractures/cracks. These cracks may cause the disconnection of cell parts, resulting in a reduction in the overall power generated by the PV modules.”
The scientists built a PVT module structure based on an aluminum alloy structure with an H-shaped pattern between the thermal absorber and the cells. Using the ANSYS software, they assembled a prototype based on a commercially available 44.2 W PVT module.
The new collector design was made up of the following components, from top to bottom: a transparent glass cover, a top ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) layer, a PV panel made of monocrystalline silicon cells connected in series, a bottom EVA layer, an H-pattern plate for thermal expansion, a thermal absorber that transfers heat to the heat transfer fluid, and an insulation layer.
“One of the main goals of this design was to allow thermal expansion in all directions (by expanding into its cavities), thus creating a smaller total expansion in any single direction, which in turn was expected to diminish the risk of cell cracking drastically,” explained the academics.
The research group simulated the H-shaped aluminum alloy pattern to have seven different widths, from one mm to seven mm, in addition to a plate design without the structure. “It is evident that the directional expansion values are lower for H-pattern expansion cavity dimensions of 1, 2, 3, and 4 mm compared to the plate with no cavity (0 mm),” they explained. “Beyond 4 mm, a notable increase in expansion is observed for the H-pattern plate with a 5 mm cavity dimension. Additionally, the expansion values for cavity dimensions of 6 and 7 mm are slightly less than 5 mm, but all surpass the H-pattern plate with no cavity.”
Overall, the simulation found the optimal design to be the one with 2 mm H dimensions, as it exhibited the lowest directional expansion of about 0.011 mm. Compared to a simulation of a reference PVT, which was the same commercially available module but without the Hs, the novel one reduced thermal expansion by 20%.
According to the researchers, the novel design reached a 10% increase in thermal efficiency. Electric efficiency was increased by 2%, and overall efficiency increased by 8%. “This study provides valuable insights into PVT collector design, offering a promising solution to the challenge of cell cracking,” the scientists concluded.
The novel module design was presented in the study “Mitigating PV cell cracking in solar photovoltaic thermal collectors with a novel H-pattern absorber design,” published in Applied Thermal Engineering. The research group was formed by scientists from the UK’s Kingston University and Cranfield University and Sweeden’s MG Sustainable Engineering and University of Gavle.

7,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/28/indonesian-government-abolishes-net-metering/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDONESIA",PATRICK JOWETT,"FEBRUARY 28, 2024",Indonesian government abolishes net metering,"Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) has enacted MEMR Regulation No. 2/2024, which abolishes net metering for rooftop PV installations.
The country first introduced net metering in November 2018. It allowed solar project owners to export excess electricity to the grid, which is operated by state utility PT PLN, in order to reduce their electricity bills. Several improvements to the scheme have been enacted since the regulation’s inception.
The latest policy amendment, which went into force on Jan. 30, guarantees that customers who have already installed rooftop solar systems before this date remain bound by the previous regulation for the next 10 years.
Marlistya Citraningrum, program manager for the Jakarta-based Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR), told pv magazine that the 10-year rule will apply to projects that have been approved but not installed, as well as arrays that have already been approved and installed.
“As an on-grid rooftop PV user, I actually have questions about this transitional rule,” Citraningrum said. “considering that during installation, rooftop PV exports are still calculated as equivalent to 0.65 of the electricity tariff based on Permen ESDM No. 49/2018, not 1:1 like Permen ESDM No. 26/2021. This transitional rule needs to be clearly informed to current rooftop solar power users.”
The Institute for Essential Services Reform believes the loss of net-metering will “make it difficult” for Indonesia to achieve the government’s National Strategic Project target of 3.6 GW of rooftop solar by 2025 and a 23% renewable energy target set for the same year.
Fabby Tumiwa, the executive director of the Institute for Essential Services Reform, said that household or small business customers will delay the adoption of rooftop PV because their peak electricity demand occurs at night, while PV generates peak energy during the day. Tumiwa said that without net-metering, rooftop PV investment will become more expensive.
“Net metering is actually an incentive for household customers to use rooftop solar systems. With PLN’s controlled electricity tariffs, net-metering helps improve the economic viability of rooftop solar systems installed at a minimum capacity of 2 kWp to 3 kWp for R1 category consumers,” Tumiwa said. “Without net-metering and the relatively high cost of batteries, this minimum capacity cannot be met, resulting in higher investment costs per kilowatt-peak unit. This will reduce the economics of rooftop solar systems.”
Citraningrum told pv magazine that while no official explanation has been given for the change, it is “likely that financial constraints of PLN is one of the main reasons.” She said the end of net metering will not benefit residential and small business PV users, but will have little impact on commercial and industrial-scale PV users, as many of them do not export excess energy. Instead, she said she hopes the decision will “trigger more energy storage use and thus contribute to bringing the cost down.”
Figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) show that at the end of 2022, Indonesia had 291 MW of installed solar capacity.

“Mining sites can be shaped during the end stages of mining to form a pumped hydro reservoir,” the scientists explained, noting that mining sites are often located close to the power network and water pumping infrastructure. “In some cases, the cost of the shaping would be similar to the cost of business-as-usual operations, and hence one (or even both) of the reservoir pairs in a Brownfield site could be prepared at very low cost.”
Their initial analysis included all suitable mining pits, pit lakes and tailings ponds within mining sites and located nearby reservoirs. They then used Geographic Information System (GIS) and Forest And Buildings removed Copernicus DEM (FABDEM) analysis to investigate the suitability of 9,424 sites for pumped hydro storage activities. This process led to the identification of 904 sites across 77 different countries, which were then included in the so-called Brownfield Atlas.
“None of the sites located by the algorithm were found to use a mining site reservoir as the upper reservoir,” the academics specified. “Mining sites may also require consideration of the water quality, unstable steep slopes within the reservoir, land-use restrictions imposed by environmental regulations, mining rights and future mining potential.”
The research group explained that the new database is an expansion of the Greenfield Atlas they developed in 2021. This atlas included 616,818 locations throughout the world that could be suitable sites for 23.1 million GWh of pumped-hydro storage capacity. In previous work published in April 2019, the same research group had identified 530,000 locations for 22 million GWh of pumped-hydro storage capacity.
The Brownfield Atlas was presented in the study “A global atlas of pumped hydro systems that repurpose existing mining sites,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy.

Utility-scale energy storage company Energy Vault has started building what will be the largest green hydrogen long-duration energy storage project in the United States, located in northern California.
The green hydrogen and battery storage facility, which will be able to provide 293 MWh of energy, is being built in the city of Calistoga, in utility Pacific Gas & Electric’s service territory. Calistoga is especially prone to public safety power shutdowns – that is, proactive outages that the utility deploys when weather conditions increase the risk of wildfires caused by its power lines. PG&E’s infrastructure has been linked with multiple wildfires in northern California and in 2019, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to these liabilities.
The Calistoga Resiliency Center, as the project is called, is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2024, at which point it will be “the first-of-its-kind and the largest utility-scale green hydrogen energy storage project in the United States,” according to Energy Vault. The facility will replace the diesel generators that PG&E currently uses to maintain back-up power in the region during wildfire-related outages. It will be able to power downtown Calistoga and the areas immediately around it, including critical facilities like fire and police stations, for up to 48 hours.
Since this project is a first-of-its kind, it required specific design and engineering capabilities, according to Marco Terruzzin, the company’s chief product officer.
The new facility’s “innovative design is an example of two proven technologies – hydrogen fuel cells and batteries – being used in concert on a single site to provide high-quality emission-free power,” Terruzzin told pv magazine USA.
The facility will operate independently from the wider grid, meaning the fuel cells and batteries must work together to provide a ‘grid-forming’ electricity supply which must reach instantaneously to the demands of the Calistoga microgrid and increase or decrease power output accordingly, he added.
“Deploying cost-effective, next-generation energy supply and long-term storage technologies is essential to ensuring grid reliability and to achieving PG&E’s goal of a net zero energy system by 2040,” Mike Delaney, PG&E’s vice president of utility partnerships and innovation, said.
Under the companies’ 10.5-year agreement, Energy Vault will own and operate the center, providing PG&E with dispatchable power. The company plans to use its energy management system, dubbed VaultOS™, to optimize the project’s operations.
The California market is particularly appealing to Energy Vault when it comes to ultra-long duration energy storage solutions because of the increased risk of prolonged wildfire-related shutoffs, Terruzzin said.
More broadly, the company is seeing an increased interest in the use of green hydrogen in utility-scale microgrids from utilities looking for configurations similar to the one being constructed in Calistoga, as well as from the public and private sectors interested in multi-day resiliency solutions, he added.
“We expect that interest to increase as customers shift their focus from simple [power purchase agreements] to 24/7 PPAs that match their electric power hour-by-hour with the electricity being generated in the region in which the customer’s electric load is located,” he said.

Up until now, the highest efficiency tandem cells, measuring 1 cm² or even smaller, are typically made with a wet chemical spin coating tool. “It is a good method for rapid testing but not scalable to industrial substrate sizes,” Fraunhofer ISE scientist Juliane Borchert told pv magazine.
Another point against spin coating, she noted, is that it cannot be used on pyramidal textured substrates, typical of the front side of silicon solar cells.
Vacuum deposition is one of the two main processing routes for industrial-scale perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells. The other is a solution-based process.
“There is a large variety of deposition methods for perovskite thin films. Some rely exclusively on wet-chemical processes, such as spin coating, blade coating and printing. Others are solvent-free evaporation processes in a vacuum, such as physical vapor deposition, or pulsed laser deposition,” explained Borchert.
The researchers are using M12-sized wafers for their experiments, which are being conducted under a 3-year €6.5 million ($7.0 million) research project called Liverpool.
“In Liverpool, we use a hybrid deposition method that combines the best aspects of both approaches. It is a vacuum evaporation process to deposit the inorganic components and then a second wet chemical step to convert this inorganic scaffold to the complete perovskite film. We target a throughput of several M12 wafers per h, or 40 per day,” said Borchert.
To put the Liverpool research in context, the Fraunhofer ISE has several perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell projects underway. For example, the Pero-Si-Scale project is focused on building a pilot line composed only of scalable processes and technologies, including characterization and testing steps for M12 tandem cells and modules. Both were launched last year in spring and both are funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK). The Liverpool project runs until April 2026.
In November, a group of researchers at Fraunhofer ISE published a study estimating that the practical power conversion efficiency potential of perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells may reach up to 39.5%.
In late January, the German institute and UK-based  Oxford PV announced fabricating a perovskite-silicon tandem solar module with a glass-glass design and a power conversion efficiency of 25%.

“The improved model boasts a cutting-edge multi-motor system equipped with a slewing drive and a bi-damper system,” the company said in a statement.  “Its innovative design facilitates the construction of longer trackers while minimizing oscillation time, averting instabilities, improving dynamic response, and raising the critical wind speed threshold. The multi-motor feature guarantees precise tracking under the most challenging conditions.”
The upgraded version has a tracking range of 60 degrees on a single axis in a single row. The steel frame features a coating of hot-dip galvanized (HDG), pre-galvanized, and zinc-magnesium Alloy (ZM).
“The upgraded system greatly increases installation efficiency,” TrinaTracker said. “The introduction of shrink tube technology has effectively halved the time needed for tube connections. Furthermore, the integration of a patented spherical bearing greatly enhances terrain adaptability, making it much easier to assemble the tracker and reducing the extra forces caused by misalignment.”
Other enhancements include an upgrade to Trina Smart Cloud, which allows greater efficiency with operations and maintenance, along with better system security. The product's tracking algorithm, the SuperTrack Algorithm, has also been modified and improved.
“It has undergone significant advances, expanding its range of application settings while autonomously identifying, training and optimizing itself, resulting in a marked increase in energy production of up to 8%,” the company said. “This additional energy yield is attributed to the combined effect of its two algorithms: STA, which boosts energy generation in overcast conditions, and SBA, specifically designed to reduce row-to-row shadows in uneven terrain.”
The tracking solution includes Trina’s Smart Controller. It consumes 0.04 kWh per day and has a tracking accuracy of less than 1 degree. It weighs less than 5 kg and can operate in temperatures between -30 C and 60 C.

The semi-transparent solar cells achieved a certified efficiency of 21.68% and a record-breaking maximum efficiency of 22.02%. “This makes them the most efficient among the perovskite solar cells using transparent electrodes in the world,” the research group said. “Additionally, they showed remarkable durability, with over 99% of their initial efficiency maintained after 240 hours of operation.”
In the paper “Mitigating Intrinsic Interfacial Degradation in Semi-Transparent Perovskite Solar Cells for High Efficiency and Long-Term Stability,” published in Advanced Energy Materials, the scientists explained that the novelty of the semi-transparent device consists of the hole transport layer (HTL) based on spiro-OMeTAD doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), which is aimed at improving conductivity.
The academics claim they were able to overcome an intrinsic LiTFSI dopant-induced internal degradation mechanism which leads to undesired lithium-ion diffusion and would have been detrimental to the cell efficiency. They created a special configuration connecting the HTL with a molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) buffer layer and transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), with this structure ensuring the formation of lithium oxides Li2O2 at the HTL surface, which they said optimizes the oxidation time of the hole transport layer.
“Converting lithium ions into stable lithium oxides through optimized oxidation mitigates the diffusion of lithium ions, thereby enhancing the stability of the device,” they explained. “This discovery reveals that lithium oxide, previously considered a simple reaction byproduct, can play a crucial role in improving efficiency and stability.”
The research group built the cell with a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), a gold (Au) metal contact, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), a perovskite absorber, the spiro-OMeTAD HTL, the MoO3 buffer layer, an indium zinc oxide (IZO) transparent conductive oxide film, and another Au metal contact.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 21.68%, an open-circuit voltage of 1,139 V, a short-circuit current density of 23.74 A-cm2, and a fill factor of 80.1%. It was also able to retain approximately 99% of the initial efficiency after 400 h in dark storage.
This device was then integrated into two bifacial perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells with four-junction and two-junction configurations. The two devices achieved efficiencies of 31.5% and 26.34% respectively, under conditions where the reflected light from the rear was 20% of standard sunlight.
Both devices relied on a bifacial silicon heterojunction (HJT) bottom solar cell provided by China-based Jusung Engineering Ltd.

The total capital expenditure for the full 120 MW project is $104 million. Financing for the first 60 MW will be provided by Rand Merchant Bank in Botswana and the World Bank’s International Finance Corp.
According to Pilskog, the construction of this utility-scale solar project started earlier this year, with construction of the second phase scheduled to start toward the middle of this year.
“We are looking to finalize the construction and start commercial operations of these projects in the first half of 2025,” he said.
Scatec owns 100% of the project and will be the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor, asset manager, and operations and maintenance provider. Terje said Scatec uses tier-1 suppliers, buys the best modules and inverters, and has good tracking systems.
“We use bifacial modules to get the best efficiency possible, so it is high-quality tier-1 equipment. A lot of it, especially the panels, is from China. The inverters come from various places,” he said.
In addition to the Botswana project, Scatec also reached commercial operation of the Kenhardt project at the end of 2023. The hybrid 540 MW solar project with 225 MW of batteries at 1.1 GW hours of battery storage capacity will provide energy for 16.5 hours per day, said Pilskog.
“We were in competition with other types of technologies, including fossil fuels, and this pure renewable energy project succeeded and was among the most competitive in price,” he added. “This shows that renewable energy is competitive with other sources of energy, including fossil fuels, given the abundance of solar irradiation in Africa.”
Scatec also provides “Release,” a distributed-generation solar and battery energy storage systems (BESS) solution for projects starting from 5 MWp.
“We are leasing out re-deployable, preassembled solutions for solar energy plus batteries. We enter into shorter-term contracts with off-takers like small utilities and mining companies, and at the end of the leasing period the system can be put back together into the container and redeployed to new locations.” said Pilskog. “We believe this solution is much better suited for mid-sized installations. We have recently finalised installation of a 36 MW solar and 20 MW/19MWh storage facility in northern Cameroon for ENEO.”
He said the company has a number of interesting opportunities in South Africa.
“We have started construction of our 273 MW Grootfontein projects in South Africa,  and by mid-year we expect to reach financial close and start construction of a 103 MW battery storage project  in South Africa which we were awarded in a tender at the end of last year,” he explained. “Within the C&I space, we have launched Lyra Energy, a platform to aggregate and sell power to mid-sized and larger industrial customers with a consumption of 20 MW to 30 MW.”
Pilskog also noted projects in other countries such as Egypt, where the company signed an agreement during COP27 to develop a 5 GW onshore wind portfolio. During COP28, it signed an agreement to develop a hybrid 1 GW solar and battery storage project.
“Scatec is also developing a green hydrogen project in Ain Sokhna in Egypt with an electrolyser capacity of 100 MW,” he said. “The green hydrogen will be used as feedstock for green ammonia and a pilot of the project is already up and running and producing green hydrogen.”
Pilskog said that Africa is the continent with the most abundant resource in terms of solar irradiation.
“In principle, Africa should be able in the future to have the cheapest source of energy,” he said. “This will be a foundation for economic growth and global competitiveness. We have to come together and figure out how to bring down the financing cost.”

Barcelona-based Prosolarbirds has developed a harmless device that prevents birds from perching on solar panels.
“We have been manufacturers of anti-bird devices for more than ten years. We market them under different brands and already in sixteen countries, such as New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Norway and Switzerland,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The company originally developed anti-bird solutions for the naval sector, but was then contacted by installation, maintenance and cleaning companies for photovoltaic panels. “They told us that excrement created a lot of problems,” the spokesperson added. “The accumulation of excrement in solar installations can reduce their performance by 45%, or can even stop energy production due to the appearance of hotspots.”
“Thus, we decided to adapt a device that is very effective in other types of applications. To test it, we contacted the Barcelona Aquarium, as the birds were affecting the photovoltaic installation on its roof,” the spokesperson said.
The company produced several devices until it found the most suitable one. “We did tests on length, height, fixings, installation times, effectiveness, resistance, and weight until we reached the current PSB device,” stated the company.
It is a rotating device, without a motor, that is activated by a slight breeze, and whose movement prevents birds from landing. According to the company, it is completely resistant to wind, snow and rain, and is made with materials resistant to salt spray, one of the most aggressive environments for any metal or technical plastic.
The system uses polyamide 6-6 UV, anodized aluminum, acetal resin, bronze and stainless steel. “Our devices are designed to not harm the birds in any case, while at the same time, they prevent them from damaging the solar panels,” said the spokesperson.
Stereoscopic and extendable, a single device covers eight 2 m x 1 m panels. Its height is 27 cm. From 2.20 m to 3.80 m it can be configured centimeter by centimeter, to be able to regulate the distance at the end of installations, slopes, industrial machinery, according to the spokesperson.
The standard mounting unit is compatible with installations of up to 10 degrees. The manufacturer also offers an accessory for other inclinations beyond that, including an East-West orientation. The measured installation time per unit is four minutes, and it is supplied in industrial boxes of 9 units.
