The ZEROe demonstrator will carry four liquid hydrogen tanks in a caudal position, as well as a hydrogen combustion engine mounted along the rear fuselage. The liquid hydrogen distribution system will feed into a conditioning system in which the liquid hydrogen will transform into its gaseous form before it is introduced into the engine where it is combusted for propulsion.
A research team led by the China University of Geosciences designed ultrafine Pd100-xCux alloy nanodot-modified TiO2 photocatalysts via the NaH2PO2-mediated co-deposition route to keep high photocatalytic performance, while replacing platinum (Pt) with palladium as the cocatalyst. “The obtained Pd100-xCux alloy nanodots (2-5 nm) are uniformly dispersed onto TiO2 and their componential ratios can be well controlled by adjusting the molar ratio of Cu and Pd precursor. Based on in situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ISI-XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) results, the as-formed Pd100-xCux alloy nanodots can effectively promote the separation of photo-generated charges and weaken the adsorption strength for hydrogen to optimize the process of hydrogen-desorption process on Pd75Cu25 alloy, thus leading to high photocatalytic H2-evolution activity,” the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics wrote on Tuesday.
The US states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to coordinate and develop a regional clean hydrogen hub. The signatory states will work together in developing the Western Inter-State Hydrogen Hub (WISHH) with supporting facilities in each state. “Each state commits that this is the only proposal(s) that they will participate in for a hydrogen hub, and that they will not submit to the DOE [Department of Energy] their own standalone proposal or a proposal in cooperation with other states or entities other than the signatories of this MOU,” reads the document published on Wednesday. Upon agreement of all four Rocky Mountain states, additional western states may be added to the group.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has presented its plans to establish the Takasago Hydrogen Park, calling it the world’s first center for validation of hydrogen-related technologies, from hydrogen production to power generation. The center will support the commercialization of hydrogen gas turbines using hydrogen as fuel. The first part of the plan, which includes demonstrating operations of hydrogen production, storage, and hydrogen fueling of gas turbines, should commence operations in the fiscal year 2023. “The Takasago Hydrogen Park will be successively expanded and developed going forward. Mitsubishi Power has announced it will use Takasago Hydrogen Park to commercialize small and large frame gas turbines on a path to 100% hydrogen firing starting in 2025,” the Japanese company wrote on Tuesday. 
Vertex Hydrogen, the joint venture between UK-focused downstream energy company Essar Oil UK and UK-based clean energy projects developer Progressive Energy, has unveiled a report detailing the development of the UK’s first-ever large-scale low carbon hydrogen production plant. “The hub will produce 1GW of low carbon hydrogen with the first production line starting in the mid 2020s,” Vertex Hydrogen wrote in a statement. Hydrogen is expected to replace fossil fuels in the industry in North West England and North Wales. The plant will sit at the heart of the HyNet low carbon cluster, the UK’s leading industrial decarbonization hub. 
Genoa-based classification society RINA has announced the Approval in Principle (AiP) of Swedish designer FKAB Marine Design’s hydrogen-powered MR Tanker, saying it is “the first AiP of a design using currently viable technology and fuels that achieves IMO 2050 targets.” Conceived by the class society and designed by FKAB, the propulsion is based on combining the ship’s fuel (LNG) with steam to produce hydrogen and CO2. “The MR LNG/hydrogen-fuelled vessel is the result of a joint project with ABB and Helbio (a subsidiary of Metacon AB),” wrote Rina last week. The classification society explained that the design allows ships to meet full decarbonization targets by either running the engine on 100% hydrogen or by producing all the power needed by fuel cells. “In this way, the owner can decide the rate of CO2 reduction.” No additional bunkering, aside from normal LNG, is required. The hydrogen produced can be used to power the main engine, or fuel cells, or a hybrid of the two. Meanwhile, the classification society Korea Register has signed a memorandum of understanding with STX Energy Solutions and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering to work together to standardize and commercialize solid oxide fuel cells. “The agreement was signed to facilitate the development of a future power generation system through the sharing and application of technology and research resources to meet the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) increasingly rigorous environmental regulations,” Korea Register wrote on Thursday. A Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) produces electricity through the electrochemical reaction of oxygen and hydrocarbons from oxidizing LNG. In other words: competing technologies are nearing a similar stage. Most of them, however, will focus on LNG-related shipping solutions. 
Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) encouraged hydrogen usage to accelerate the energy transition in the country. The message was conveyed directly by Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Arifin Tasrif on the sidelines of a bilateral meeting on Monday with the Republic of Korea's minister of trade, industry and energy, Moon Sung Wook, in Jakarta. “The main strategy to be carried out towards carbon neutrality on the supply side is through the development of massive renewable energy, with a focus on solar, hydro and geothermal power plants as well as hydrogen,” said Arifin.

SGCC Chairman Xin Baoan said Wednesday in a commentary published in the state-owned People’s Daily that SGCC aims to have 100GW of battery storage by 2030, up from 3GW today. This is a very ambitious goal, given that BloombergNEF forecasts that all of China will have about 96GW of battery storage by 2030.
Under a five-year plan released this week, China is aiming to slash battery storage costs by around 30% by 2025, paving the way for local industries to dominate the global market by 2030. In addition, the fifteenth five-year plan drafted by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the National Energy Administration (NEA) gives special attention to compressed air storage and envisages that this technology will realize engineering applications in units of 100MW of capacity.
But SGCC's plans don't end only with battery storage, the grid operator is also planning to increase its pumped storage capacity from the current 26.3GW to 100GW by 2030. This builds on its announcement in January when it said it had commissioned the world’s largest pumped-hydro facility. Located in Hebei province, the 3.6GW Fengning Pumped Storage Power Station consists of 12 reversible pump generating sets with a capacity of 300MW each and has a power generation capacity from storage of 6.612 billion kWh. To put SGCC's plans into perspective, China is targeting 120GW of operational pumped-hydro facilities by 2030, according to the NEA.
Beyond storage
Furthermore, Xin said that SGCC is also planning to increase its cross-provincial power transmission capacity and support the buildout of solar and wind in the western desert areas. Finally, he said the grid operator will also seek to implement flexible DC transmission, virtual power plants, safety and stability of large power grids, and ultra-high voltage tap-changers, among other technologies.
According to Xin, SPCC made these plans to align with the Chinese government’s dual carbon goal to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. China's decarbonization policy has already created pressure on state-owned enterprises mandating energy storage with the order to build renewables-plus-storage projects introduced for the very first time by the NEA last April.
In terms of supporting policies, NEA, the country’s major energy policymaking authority, has already launched a series of incentives and advisory documents with an eye on the interim goal to deploy 30GW of energy storage capacity by 2025. In addition, several provinces have also released policies supporting storage for renewable energy installations.
But despite its decarbonization plans, China continues to account for a great share of global coal additions. A recent report published by three environmental think tanks and lobbyists finds that China is home to 55% of the world pipeline for new coal facilities and, together with India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Turkey, and Bangladesh, jointly accounts for 82% of plans for new coal plants.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/25/first-attempt-to-build-tandem-perovskite-perc-polo-solar-cells-achieves-21-3-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 25, 2022",First attempt to build tandem perovskite-PERC/POLO solar cells achieves 21.3% efficiency,"Scientists in Germany have developed for the first time a tandem perovskite silicon solar cell based on an n+-type polysilicon on oxide (POLO) front junction and a passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) side.
“This is an important achievement, since PERC silicon cells on p-type silicon are the ‘workhorse' of photovoltaics, with a market share of about 50% of all solar cells produced worldwide,” the scientists said. “Our bottom cells comprise all components of industrial PERC cells, except for the substitution of phosphoryl chloride (POCl3) diffusion by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) of in situ n+-type p-doped poly-Si,” they further explained, noting that the process flow for this bottom cell is compatible with commercial mainstream PERC technologies.
The cell was fabricated with a p-type gallium-doped M2 Czochralski (Cz) wafer with 156.75 mm edge length and a diameter of 210 mm, with the stacks of Al2O3 and SiNx being deposited on both sides of the wafer. “The rear-side 15 nm Al2O3/100 nm SiNx stack serves for passivation just as in an industrial PERC cell,” the research team explained. “The front-side 10 nm Al2O3/40 nm SiNx stack passivates the perimeter region around the active cell area. It also serves the rather fundamental purpose to stabilize the POLO junction passivation during the subsequent firing process and is therefore removed in the active area only after firing.”

The perovskite top cell was developed with a p−i−n device architecture and a triple-halide perovskite with a bandgap of 1.68 eV known as CsFAPb(IBrCl)3. “As its thickness strongly influences the current density generated in the top cell, adapting its fabrication process is crucial to achieve current matching between the subcells,” the academics emphasized. “To reduce the current mismatch, we deposit a thinner perovskite layer by increasing the spin-coating speed to 5000 revolutions per minute (rpm) resulting in a film thickness of about 470 nm.”
The two-terminal perovskite−POLO−PERC tandem solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 21.3% and the scientists said this proof-of-concept tandem device has potential for further efficiency improvements. “For this purpose, one could adapt the surface of the silicon wafers and thus quickly increase the efficiency to about 25%,” said the research's corresponding author, Silvia Mariotti.
The German group believes the efficiency of these devices may reach much higher values through adjustments in the perovskite thickness and bandgap that were not considered so far. “Based on our experimental findings and supporting optical simulations, we identify major process enhancements and estimate a PCE potential of 29.5%,” it further explained.
A full description of the cell can be found in the study Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Fabricated Using Industrial p-Type Polycrystalline Silicon on Oxide/Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell Silicon Bottom Cell Technology, published in RRL Solar. The research group comprises scientists from the Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH) and the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie (HZB).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/25/sustainable-vertically-integrated-solar-manufacturing-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 25, 2022","Sustainable, vertically integrated solar manufacturing in India","From pv magazine India
The Indian solar manufacturing sector must strive to build a sustainable, vertically integrated ecosystem, rather than focusing solely on output, according to a new report by JMK Research and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
India, which is targeting 300GW of installed solar generation capacity by 2030, has a PV cell manufacturing capacity of 4.3GW and a module manufacturing capacity of 18GW. But the actual output is even lower, as most of these manufacturing facilities have been operating below their nameplate capacities at a capacity utilization factor (CUF) of 40% to 50%, or less.
The nation has been a laggard in manufacturing – not just for upstream PV components such as wafers and cells, but also modules. By comparison, China accounts for about 61% of global solar module manufacturing capacity of 358GW. India’s manufacturing capacity of 18GW is roughly equal to the annual capacity additions of the top individual Chinese PV brands, which underscores the vast scope for Indian companies to match their economies of scale, according to the report.
For raw materials, Indian manufacturers rely on imports mainly from China and face associated risks of shortages and price hikes. This highlights the need for a sustainable, vertically integrated domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem.
“Without large-scale domestic manufacturing, from raw materials through to modules, the overarching risks of logistics and commodity price fluctuations for imports will persist,” said co-author Vibhuti Garg, energy economist and lead India, IEEFA.
Policy push
The report notes that India's ambitious PV installation target, coupled with government support, has made the prospects for indigenous PV manufacturing increasingly vibrant. Dozens of companies are vying to make their mark in the Indian solar sector.
The government of India’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for integrated PV manufacturing, with an initial outlay of INR 4,500 crore ($616 million), plus the additional allocation of roughly $2.5 billion in the 2022 budget, would have the combined potential to produce at least 40GW of solar modules.
“The PLI scheme alone, if judiciously implemented, can increase the integrated solar module, cell and wafer domestic manufacturing capacity several times over in the next three to four years,” said Jyoti Gulia, founder of JMK Research. “This will help in creating a huge demand potential for the PV ancillary market – solar glass, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) … and skilled workforce. The direct investment in the country on account of PLI budget expansion would potentially rise.”
Path forward
Other issues for the Indian industry are relatively low capacity utilization rates in factories that make solar cells, as well as the type of solar cells being produced. About 60% to 70% of domestic production employs multi-Si module technology, which is nearing the point of obsolescence.
New manufacturers that plan to expand or enter the market aim to install machinery to produce mono-Si modules, which is the prevailing technology. This development will help domestic players to compete with global rivals on quality and price.
The Indian PV industry also faces mid- to long-term challenges of high manufacturing expenses, inadequate research and development (R&D), and a shortage of skilled manpower.
“Developing significant manufacturing capacities in raw materials, especially polysilicon, will be highly capital intensive and technologically complex. Domestic manufacturing companies need to have a proactive technology partnership with innovators or research institutes,” said Garg. “Rather than focusing solely on output, it’s imperative for the domestic solar manufacturing industry to create a strong foundation for sustainable development overall.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/25/sonnenstromfabrik-plans-300mw-solar-module-line-in-germany-with-patented-rec-tech/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,GERMANY",BECKY BEETZ,"FEBRUARY 25, 2022",Sonnenstromfabrik plans 300MW solar module line in Germany with patented REC tech,"Sonnenstromfabrik (CS Wismar GmbH) is expanding its 200MW solar module manufacturing operations in Wismar, Germany, to include a new 300MW line, managing director Bernhard Weilharter has told pv magazine. The goal is to ramp up in Q2 of this year, with mass production slated for Q3.
The German company has signed a memorandum of understanding with Norway-headquartered REC Group under which the parties intend to enter into a mutual cooperation agreement to implement the latter’s patented split solar cell and junction box technology (EP 3 017 520) for the manufacture of two new PERC module products featuring half cut solar cells and large format wafers. The mutual cooperation agreement will also include a license to REC’s EP 3 017 520 patent.

Commenting on the reason for the partnership, Weilharter said it was “unavoidable” due to the trend towards larger format wafers. “Cells must be cut to reduce currents to a level that can be handled by inverters. REC's innovative technology has been widely recognized in the industry for enabling unmatched gains in performance and efficiency,” he said.
Sonnenstromfabrik’s original plan was to introduce products with larger wafers at a later stage; however, this was brought forward and in 2020, the company received board approval to purchase new equipment.
Unfortunately, machines to cope with wafer sizes larger than 166mm were not available in Europe. “We know that the cell manufacturers are going towards 210 and even 220mm so we either had to buy Asian equipment or develop our own,” Weilharter said. In the end, the company chose to build new stringer and interconnection equipment that could deal with wafer sizes up to 220mm, together with an Italian manufacturer.
“Our plan was to have a new module design which was based on 210mm wafers in a third cut cell design, quite similar to what you see today,” continued Weilharter. However, the technological development of inverters required to support these larger sizes did not keep pace, and Sonnenstromfabrik found that many of the existing products could not handle the bigger currents.
Thus, the company changed its product development strategy, away from a module design with 210mm wafers and third cut cells, to a design featuring 182mm wafers and half cut cells. “That's basically the point where the challenge started,” said Weilharter, “because this would require us to use the half cut design patented by REC.”
Since it was not possible to find a technical alternative, Sonnenstromfabrik approached REC to see if a commercial agreement could be reached.
Agnieszka Schulze, spokesperson at REC Solar EMEA GmbH told pv magazine, “While we need to protect our technology, such a consulting agreement is the best way for everyone, because our efforts and investments are recognized, but at the same time we support a stronger adoption of innovative solar PV technology in the interest of consumers.”
In addition to the parties avoiding any patent disputes, REC will also provide consulting services to Sonnenstromfabrik under the agreement. “It gives us a head start and it gives a stable solution for us and for our customers for the next two years,” Weilharter explained.
Commenting on the uniqueness of REC’s patented technology, Schulze continued, “It's the combination of cut cells and the split junction box technology and putting these both together while providing reliability and high performance.”
Overall, Sonnenstromfabrik will offer three different product sizes, ranging from 355 to 490W. Details of these emerged last September when the company unveiled three new formats for its glass-film and glass-glass PV modules.
Image: Sonnenstromfabrik (CS Wismar GmbH)
 At the time, it said the smallest of the three module series will feature full black products with a size of 1,560 x 1,145mm and a maximum output of 350W. The company will also offer a Full Black & Smart module series measuring 1,745 x 1,145mm, with a power output of up to 400W. Both series are available as glass-backsheet and glass-glass solar modules. The largest product will feature glass-backsheet modules with a size of 2,110 x 1,145mm and an output of 490W.
The smaller solar modules are intended for use in the residential and commercial PV rooftop market, while the most powerful are more suitable for ground-mounted PV projects.
Weilharter added, “First of all, we will work on P-type PERC but once this is stabilized, we will also look into alternative cell technology to further improve on the power density and REC will be an important know-how source for us to improve here.”
In terms of the markets it is targeting, Sonnenstromfabrik will continue to primarily focus on Western Europe, in places like Germany, France, Benelux, Switzerland, Austria, and Scandinavia.
Sustainability is also a key priority for both REC and Sonnenstromfabrik. Indeed, Sonnenstromfabrik plans to extend its low carbon principles, which were initially applied in 2016 for its modules on the French market, to its entire product range. To achieve this, it will carry out life cycle assessments for all of its products going forward and will also produce an annual sustainability report to track progress.
Meanwhile, REC not only produces its wafers in Norway using hydro energy, but it also focuses on upcycling kerf via a “unique new kerf processing technology” – during the standard wafer slicing process, around 30% of the silicon remains as waste, or kerf – to reuse it in cells and modules, said Schulze. “This allows us to better protect the environment by avoiding mining activities and lowering the energy consumption by up to 85% compared to conventional Siemens-process as used mainly in China,” she added. The company also produces “polysilicon with the lowest carbon footprint,” she added.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/25/bifacial-topcon-solar-cell-with-23-84-efficiency-90-lower-silver-consumption/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 25, 2022","Bifacial TOPCon solar cell with 23.84% efficiency, 90% lower silver consumption","Researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE have been seeking for several years to reduce silver usage — a main concern for the PV industry — in the metallization of TOPCon solar cells, for which relying on lower amounts of the precious metal is crucial to reduce manufacturing costs and gain further market share.
Recently, a group of scientists from the German institute used contacts based on galvanic nickel (Ni) copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) instead of common silver contacts to fabricate an n-type bifacial TOPCon cell that is claimed to achieve higher efficiency than its counterparts with printed silver contacts, while also reducing silver consumption by 90%. “Even in industrial production, this galvanic metallization enables significant silver savings without having to compromise on efficiency,” said researcher Sven Kluska.
Designed for screen-printed metallization, the cell was fabricated with an industrial-type boron emitter on the textured front side passivated by a stack made of aluminium oxide and silicon nitride (AlOx/SiNx). The rear side was made with a TOPCon layer with a tunnelling oxide and a highly n-type doped poly-Si layer which is covered by a SiNx layer.
“The plating process combines two single side electroplating steps of a Ni/Cu/Ag stack subsequently on each side,” the scientists said referring to the metallization technique used. “The Ni and Cu were supplied by Atotech Group, whereas the Ag electrolyte is identical as presented by Grübel.”
The rear TOPCon side is initially plated by performing a hydrofluoric acid (HF) pretreatment process intended to remove native and laser-induced oxide layers within the laser contact opening (LCO). In a second step, a Ni-Cu stack is deposited by light-induced plating (LIP) and finished by an Ag immersion plated capping.
The performance of the plated cell, which has a full area of 268 cm2, was compared to that of a similar device that went through screen-printed metallization. The champion plated device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.84%, an open-circuit voltage of 709 mV, a short-circuit current of 40.9 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 82.2%. The screen-printed cell showed an efficiency of 23.46%, an open-circuit voltage of 708 mV, a short-circuit current of 40.4 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 82.0%
Reducing the LCO width and adapting the number of fingers, the plated contacts benefit from narrower contact widths down to 5.5 μm, allowing a short-circuit current gain of nearly up to 0.5 mA/cm2, the academics explained. “There were no indications of the LCO width impacting the contact adhesion. Optimization of the HF pretreatment prior to the plating process showed an improvement of the contact resistivity allowing to stabilize the fill factor above 82% despite smaller contact geometries than the screen-printed references.”
The cell and the related manufacturing process are described in the paper Progress of plated metallization for industrial bifacial TOPCon silicon solar cells, published in Progress in Photovoltaics. “Plating metallization reveals to be a suitable candidate to metallize i-TOPCon solar cells with high efficiencies exceeding the screen-printed baseline metallization,” the scientists concluded.

“The factory is planned to reach a capacity of 30 MW by the end of the year,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “The main purpose of the plant is to demonstrate the manufacturing process to Power Roll’s licensing partners as well as producing pilot output for testing and demonstration.”
Power Roll said it uses low-cost roll-to-roll manufacturing processes on top of its patented microgroove patterns to produce what it calls an ultra-low-cost solar PV solution. “This simplicity of production is core to Power Roll’s plans to license high-scale manufacturing to local companies. This will enable manufacturing of solar film to scale up globally. We will fully demonstrate our technology at our Durham facility but partnerships with large companies in the UK and overseas will see capacity expand in the next few years,” the spokesperson went on to say.
Power Roll added that it was in advanced negotiations with manufacturing partners to scale-up, in parallel with its own factory development.
The manufacturing process consists of four different steps. The company first embosses ultra-thin micro-grooves into a flexible film and then embossed pattern on the solar film is then imprinted in polyethylene (PET) film. This process is described as similar to the creation of holograms, such as those on credit cards, and uses the same machinery. In a second step, the microgroove walls are coated with conductive metals, with each groove wall being coated with a conductive metal to channel the sun’s energy across the film for extraction.

The third step consists of printing the perovskite absorber. The perovskite solar energy absorber layer is printed using high-speed and standardised printing processes. Through the fourth and final step, the solar film is encapsulated in barrier films to protect it for the desired lifespan of the finished solar product.
The 1-micron wide micro-groves are the core element of the film technology, as they are claimed to eliminate the need for several expensive process steps needed by other solar designs. “The micro-groves are specifically designed to be manufactured using high-speed roll-to-roll processes and because each solar cell and module are microscopic, the impact of any damage is limited to the specific area impacted and does not impact a larger area as in current PV solutions,” the spokesperson emphasized.
 
“Emerging solutions such as Power Roll’s flexible film will enable solar to be deployed more easily in the built environment, off-grid, on vehicles and other applications where traditional silicon solar panels are too heavy or too expensive to be used,” the company said in a statement. “When the film is produced at scale, manufacturing costs are forecast to be as low as a tenth of the cost of other flexible PV. Solar film can be deployed on warehouses and agricultural sheds where the roofs are not strong enough to bear the weight of traditional solar panels.”
Power Roll was able to raise around £20 million in investment rounds since it was founded. Through the latest round held this month, is raised £5.8 million.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/25/new-rules-allow-distributors-to-roll-out-standalone-power-systems-in-australia/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 25, 2022",New rules allow distributors to roll out standalone power systems in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) has announced a package of new rules that enable distribution network businesses to supply their customers in the National Electricity Market (NEM) using standalone power systems (SAPS), where it is cheaper than maintaining a connection to the grid.
The new rules allow electricity distributors in NEM jurisdictions that opt into the new regulatory framework to install SAPS for both individuals and communities where standalone energy generation may be cheaper, safer and more reliable than grid supply.
AEMC Chair Anna Collyer said the rules were presented on Thursday by South Australian Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan and their publication was the final step in implementing the commission’s recommendations, following a lengthy review and legislative process.
“Standalone power systems aren’t a new concept, but they have become more viable as technology improves and costs decrease,” Collyer said. “Until now, SAPS weren’t included in the NEM and weren’t covered by consistent reliability standards or customer protections. We now have agreement on a staged implementation, beginning August this year.”
SAPS typically comprise a renewable energy supply such as solar PV panels coupled with a battery energy storage system and, where necessary, a back-up generator. The self-sufficient power units include both microgrids and individual power systems.
The technology has been widely deployed in remote parts of Western Australia but are less prominent in the NEM jurisdictions of Queensland, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania.
Collyer said that is likely to change, saying electricity distributors operating in the NEM had predicted new SAPS solutions might cater to several thousand customers in the next decade and could expand faster as grid connections reached the end of their service lives.
“Maintaining and replacing traditional older power lines and related infrastructure is a major cost in a country the size of Australia,” she said. “This is a timely rule change as we continue to transition to a renewable energy future. It increases the reliability and resilience of energy supply in remote areas, as well as reducing network costs for all customers.”
Collyer said the new rules will help unlock the benefits of new technologies that are increasingly allowing electricity services to be delivered through alternatives to a traditional grid connection at a lower cost and with improved reliability and safety.
“Particularly in remote, bushfire-prone areas, SAPS do away with the need to replace damaged grid connections at significant expense,” she said. “In fact, the power infrastructure that connects communities to the grid can also cause bushfires, which is another reason SAPS are attractive alternatives to traditional network connections in those areas.”
The publication of the new rules come after an extensive AEMC review, completed in 2020. The AEMC said the findings of the review were supported by the NEM jurisdictions and led to changes in 2021 to the national electricity and retail energy laws.
“The changes operate on an opt-in basis, as some states may need to make amendments to their own legislation to accommodate SAPS,” Collyer said.
The rule changes apply to new distributor-led SAPS. Existing microgrids and other independent power systems will continue to be managed under state and territory legislation.

Shipper DHL Express has announced plans to deploy solar panels on 67 of its delivery trucks in an effort to cut fuel use and limit carbon emissions. The company said the TRAILAR solar arrays will reduce CO2 emissions by 1,000 kg per vehicle.
The solar array will be used to charge the truck’s battery, power lift gates and other ancillary services. This reduces load on the system’s alternator, reducing the fuel use of heavy-duty trucks.
“We’re aiming to improve the lives of people where they live and work, using cleaner pickup and delivery solutions – such as electric vehicles and cargo cycles, and now augmenting our truck fleet with this innovative solar solution,” said DHL Express US CEO Greg Hewitt. “This is another strategic step in our drive forward to decarbonization, and over time reducing all logistics related emissions to net zero by 2050.”
Transportation is believed to account for 21% of global emissions, and road travel accounts for three-quarters of all transport emissions. Most of this comes from passenger vehicles, which contribute 45.1%. About 29.4% comes from trucks carrying freight, so about 6.1% of global emissions share comes from ground shipping.
The TRAILAR system is equipped with telematics for detailed reporting on the entire system, including battery health, ancillary equipment charge, and overall fuel savings. It continuously manages the battery through a charge controller, maintaining optimum battery levels even when the truck is off. This constant care of charge level reduces wear on the battery and alternator, directly lowering vehicle maintenance costs.
The company said it has implemented the solution within many of its fleet operations at business units that operate in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa.
Last May, the company announced an accelerated roadmap to decarbonize its operations, with an opex and capex investment of $7.8 billion over the next 10 years.
