This weight reduction increases the capacity of the fuel cell by 30%,” said Boston Materials. 
The University of Houston‘s Texas Center for Superconductivity (TcSUH) has developed a NiFe (nickel and iron)-based electrocatalyst that interacts with CuCo (copper-cobalt) to create high-performance seawater electrolysis. TcSUH said the multi-metallic electrocatalyst is “one of the best performing among all reported transition- metal-based OER electrocatalysts.” The research team, led by Prof. Zhifeng Ren, is now working with Element Resources, a Houston-based company that specializes in green hydrogen projects. TcSUH's paper, recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, explains that the apt oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis needs to be resistant to corrosive seawater and avoid chlorine gas as a side product, while decreasing costs. The researchers said that each kilogram of hydrogen produced via seawater electrolysis could also yield 9 kg of pure water.
University of Strathclyde researchers said in a new study that polymers loaded with iridium are apt photocatalysts, as they decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen cost effectively. Polymers are indeed printable, “allowing the use of cost-effective printing technologies for scale up,” said the researchers. The study, “Photocatalytic overall water splitting under visible light enabled by a particulate conjugated polymer loaded with iridium,” was recently published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal managed by the German Chemical Society. “The photocatalysts (polymers) are of huge interest as their properties can be tuned using synthetic approaches, allowing for simple and systematic optimization of the structure in the future and to optimize activity further,” said researcher Sebastian Sprick.
Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) and Firstgas Group have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to identify opportunities to produce and distribute green hydrogen to homes and businesses in New Zealand. “In March 2021, Firstgas announced a plan to decarbonize New Zealand's pipeline network by transitioning from natural gas to hydrogen. From 2030, hydrogen will be blended into the North Island's natural gas network, with conversion to a 100% hydrogen grid by 2050,” FFI said. It noted that it is also interested in teaming up with other companies for a “green Pilbara” vision for giga-scale projects. The Pilbara is a dry, scarcely populated region in the northern part of Western Australia. 
Aviation H2 has signed a strategic partnership with aircraft charter operator FalconAir. “Aviation H2 will get access to the FalconAir Bankstown hangar, facilities and operating licences so they can begin building Australia's first hydrogen-powered plane,” Aviation H2 said, adding that it is on track to put a plane in the sky by the middle of 2023.
Hydroplane has signed its second US Air Force (USAF) Small Business Technology Transfer contract. “This contract allows the company, in partnership with the University of Houston, to demonstrate an engineering model hydrogen fuel cell based powerplant in a ground and flight demonstration,” Hydroplane said. The company aims to fly its demonstrator aircraft in 2023. The 200 kW modular solution should replace existing combustion power plants in existing single-engine and urban air mobility platforms.
Bosch said it will invest up to €500 million ($527.6 million) by the end of the decade in its mobility solutions business sector to develop “the stack, the core component of an electrolyzer.” Bosch is using PEM technology. “With pilot plants scheduled to commence operation in the coming year, the company plans to supply these smart modules to manufacturers of electrolysis plants and industrial service providers from 2025 onward,” the company said, adding that it will focus on mass production and economies of scale in its facilities in Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, and the Netherlands. The company expects the electrolyzer components market to reach around €14 billion by 2030.
RWE has secured funding approval for a 14 MW electrolyzer test facility in Lingen, Germany. Construction is set to start in June. “RWE aims to use the trial facility to test two electrolyzer technologies under industrial conditions: Dresden manufacturer Sunfire will install a pressure-alkaline electrolyzer with a capacity of 10 MW for RWE,” the German company said. “In parallel, Linde, a leading global industrial gases and engineering company, will set up a 4 MW proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. RWE will own and operate the entire site in Lingen.” RWE will invest €30 million, while the state of Lower Saxony will contribute €8 million. The electrolyzer facility should generate up to 290 kg of green hydrogen per hour from spring 2023. “The trial operating phase is initially planned for a three-year period, with an option for a further year,” said RWE, noting that it has also started approval procedures for the construction of a hydrogen storage facility in Gronau, Germany.
The German federal government and the state of Lower Saxony have signed a letter of intent to work on infrastructure. They aim to facilitate the country's short-term diversification needs, while also accommodating green hydrogen and its derivatives. “The development of LNG import structures that are H2-ready are not only sensible in the short and medium term, but absolutely necessary,” the Lower Saxony authorities said in a statement. 
Gasgrid Finland and its Swedish counterpart, Nordion Energi, have announced the launch of the Nordic Hydrogen Route, a cross-border hydrogen infrastructure project in the Bay of Bothnia region, by 2030. “The companies seek to develop a network of pipelines that would effectively transport energy from producers to consumers to ensure they have access to an open, reliable, and safe hydrogen market. An integrated energy infrastructure would connect customers across the region, from hydrogen and e-fuels producers to steelmakers, who are eager to create new value chains and products as well as to decarbonize their operations,” said Gasgrid Finland. Regional demand for hydrogen is estimated to exceed 30 TWh by 2030, and around 65 TWh by 2050.
Thierry Breton, the EU Commissioner for the Internal Market, met with 20 CEOs from the European electrolyzer manufacturing sector in Brussels this week to pave the way toward achieving the objectives of the REPowerEU Communication, which aims for 10 metric tons of locally produced renewable hydrogen and 10 metric tons of imports by 2030. According to Hydrogen Europe, the meeting focused on regulatory frameworks, easy access to finance, and supply chain integration. The European executive body wants an installed electrolyzer capacity of 90 GW to 100 GW by 2030.
BP revealed plans this week to set up large-scale hydrogen production facilities in Teesside, England, with one focusing on blue hydrogen and another on green hydrogen. “Together, aiming to produce 1.5 GW of hydrogen by 2030 – 15% of the UK government's 10 GW target by 2030,” the company said. It plans to invest GBP 18 billion ($22.2 billion) in wind energy, CCS, EV charging, and new oil and gas fields. Shell, meanwhile, said it might increase its hydrogen interests over the next few months. CEO Ben van Beurden said Shell is “very close to making a few major investment decisions on hydrogen in Northwest Europe,” with a focus on blue and green hydrogen. 
Anglo American has unveiled a prototype of the world's largest hydrogen-powered mine haul truck. It is designed to operate in everyday mining conditions at its Mogalakwena PGMs mine in South Africa. “The 2 MW hydrogen-battery hybrid truck, generating more power than its diesel predecessor and capable of carrying a 290-ton payload, is part of Anglo American's nuGen Zero Emission Haulage Solution (ZEHS),” the company said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/06/the-mobility-revolution-new-lithium-ion-battery-material-for-faster-charging-times/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"MAY 6, 2022",The mobility rEVolution: New lithium-ion battery material for faster charging times,"One of the biggest bottlenecks to charging in today’s lithium-ion batteries is the anode. The most common anode is made of graphite, which is very energy dense, but cannot be charged too quickly due to the risk of fire and explosions from a process known as lithium metal plating. Against the backdrop of the growing demand for battery to have high energy and faster charging times, researchers at the University of California San Diego and Boise State University have developed a new approach to making novel lithium-ion battery materials. They transformed a non-crystalline (amorphous) material into a crystalline Nb2O5 anode material with exceptional battery properties – by cycling it with lithium. Intercalation metal oxides, like the rock salt Nb2O5 material discovered by the team, are promising anode alternatives due to the reduced risk of lithium plating at low voltages. “If you want to charge your EV for 15 minutes and then get on the road for the next 200 or 300 miles, you need new battery electrodes that can be charged at a very fast rate without much loss in performance,” says Pete Barnes, the lead author of the study published in Nature Materials. The new electrode can achieve high lithium storage of 269 mAh/g at a charging rate of 20 mA/g, and more importantly, continues to retain a high capacity of 191 mAh/g at a high charging rate of 1 A/g. “The trick is to start from a higher energy phase, such as an amorphous material. Just cycling the material with lithium allows us to create new crystalline arrangements that exhibit improved properties beyond those made via traditional means such as solid-state reactions,” says Hui (Claire) Xiong, a professor of materials science and engineering at Boise State University.
Speaking of next-generation battery materials, U.S.-based start-up Sila, is building a large-scale factory in Washington State to make advanced anodes that use silicon instead of graphite, which the company says will make EV battery packs more energy-efficient and, eventually, cheaper. The company, cofounded by one of Tesla’s earliest engineers and backed by Mercedes-Benz, is making an initial investment to deliver annual silicon-based anode production sufficient to power 10 GWh of cells when used as a full graphite replacement, or up to 50 GWh of cells when used as a partial replacement. This is enough material to power batteries in up to 100,000-500,000 EVs and 500 million mobile phones annually. Production lines at the facility will start-up in the second half of 2024, with full start of production underway in the first half of 2025. Power for the facility will be zero-carbon, supplied by Washington’s hydroelectric grid. The company told Forbes that Daimler and BMW will be the first users of its materials in high-end electric models. “First and foremost, we’re pushing for higher energy density,” CEO Gene Berdichevsky said, estimating that Sila’s anodes provide up to a 20% improvement in energy efficiency to the best current lithium-ion battery packs. They can also enable faster charging or hold down pack costs by reducing the number of cells needed to go the same distance. “If you’ve got a vehicle that has 1,000 cells in it, and it gives you the range you want when each battery stores 20% more energy you can go from 1,000 cells to 800 cells. Now the vehicle is lighter and it's cheaper to make.”
Meanwhile, German sports car manufacturer Porsche is acquiring shares in the U.S.-based company Group14 Technologies, a producer of advanced silicon-carbon technology for lithium-ion batteries. As the lead investor, Porsche is raising $100 million and leading a Series C funding round in which several companies are investing a total of $400 million, which Group14 Technologies is planning to use to accelerate its worldwide production silicon anode material for lithium-ion batteries. According to Porsche, Group14 will also supply the Cellforce Group from Tübingen, in which Porsche holds a majority stake. Cellforce is currently building its battery factory near Stuttgart with production scheduled to start in 2024. The company intends to produce 100 MWh of high-performance battery cells per year there – primarily for Porsche’s models with high-performance drivetrains. “The anode material from Group14 has gamechanger potential on the way to shorter charging times,” says Markus Gräf, Managing Director of the Cellforce Group. With the new silicon anode, Cellforce aims to secure high energy density and lower internal resistance. This allows it to absorb more during energy recuperation while at the same time offering improved performance for fast charging. Another special feature of the Cellforce battery cell is the fact that it is said to be more resistant to high temperatures, the company says.
Like many other EV makers, U.S.-based Lucid has announced price hikes on the back of supply chain issues. The EV manufacturer reported nearly $58 million in revenue in its first quarter earnings and announced substantial price increases to its luxury Air sedan for any new reservations beginning June 1. The EV startup said it is experiencing strong demand with more than 30,000 customer reservations as of today, which represents potential sales of $2.9 billion. “Similar to many companies in our industry, we continue to face global supply chain and logistics challenges, including Covid-related factory shutdowns in China. We are working closely with our suppliers to mitigate the impact of disruptions,” Sherry House, Lucid’s CFO, said in a statement. “While any extended disruptions could result in an impact to our production forecast, today we are reiterating our 12,000-14,000-vehicle production forecast for 2022 based on the information we have at this point combined with our mitigation plans.” The Air Grand Touring will increase about $15,000 to a cost of $154,000; the Air Touring will cost $12,400 more at $107,400; and the Air Pure will go up $10,000, to $87,400. The Lucid Air Grand Touring Performance model, the price of which was announced two weeks ago, will remain the same at $179,000, the company said
As persistent bottlenecks in supply continue to bite, Volkswagen is “basically sold out” of electric vehicles for this year in Europe and the US, according to Group CEO Herbert Diess. In the first quarter, Germany’s biggest car manufacturer delivered over 99,000 BEVs and demand is ramping up, with over 30,000 vehicle orders placed in western Europe alone. VW aims for a total of around 700,000 EV sales for 2022. “We have very high order books and […] order intake on electric vehicles,” Diess added. “That accounts for all of our models from ID.3, ID.4, the Audi models — [all] are extremely well received in the markets, Škoda models are also very well received in Europe.” In China, however, due to Covid-related restrictions, demand for EVs has been weakened. But VW remains confident that its target of 140,000 EVs this year is possible. Nonetheless, the carmaker warned about “an ongoing risk” that the war, and lockdowns in China could have a “negative impact on business activities in the current year.”
Meanwhile, in Germany, Tesla is reportedly looking to massively expand its manufacturing capacity nearby Berlin. According to local media reports from RBB (Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg), the EV maker wants to buy about 100 hectares of land adjacent to the current site which spread across 300 hectares. While there is a lot of free space on its existing land, local media suggests that Tesla wants to keep that land free for future expansions of the car factory. The additional area is likely to be used for storage facilities. As with the initial land purchase, there are still a lot of hurdles to overcome, both legislative and environmental.  In terms of possible purchase price, RBB says Tesla will have to pay around €13 million for the additional area if the state authorities demand the same price as for the original 300 hectares.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/06/scientists-industry-players-reveal-plans-for-new-letid-testing-standard/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,QUALITY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MAY 6, 2022","Scientists, industry players reveal plans for new LETID testing standard","Over time, light-elevated temperature-induced degradation (LETID) can cause significant performance losses in PV modules in the field. The problem was first recognized around 2012; the industry did not know the exact cause behind it, but it has been quick to develop mitigation strategies.
Understanding the effectiveness of these strategies, and ultimately eliminating performance losses associated with LETID, requires comprehensive testing. Such testing is increasingly a requirement for module buyers wary of the financial impacts of unexpected performance losses.
A collaborative effort between scientists and industrial players across Asia, Europe and the United States has tested a range of silicon PV modules for LETID, with the aim of developing a new, applicable protocol. Their findings and the testing procedures they used will likely be adopted into a formal standard published by the International Electrotechnical Commission later this year.
“Global researchers have published many promising strategies for reducing or eliminating LETID, and there is evidence both in this work and elsewhere that manufacturers in recent years have adopted these strategies,” said Joseph Karas, a researcher at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory. “Some modules in this work showed essentially no LETID sensitivity. Still, LETID risk is not a fully resolved matter as new wafer types and cell architectures are being adopted which might be LETID-sensitive.”
The group described the testing procedures in “Results from an international interlaboratory study on light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation in solar modules,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The procedures primarily involve subjecting modules to high temperatures, and either directly injecting a current, or placing them under simulated sunlight at different levels, either to cause LETID degradation or initiate a recovery mechanism in already degraded modules.
By fabricating intentionally LETID sensitive modules, they were able to calibrate the procedures to maximize LETID, and could distinguish such losses from other issues. Testing was conducted over a period of four weeks, but the researchers noted that in the soon-to-be-published standard, this will be reduced to two, with a doubling of the injected current to compensate.
“This work, the forthcoming TS, and the advancing scientific understanding of LETID will help mitigate the physical and financial effects of LETID,” the researchers said. “Manufacturers will be able to test for LETID and engineer LETID-free cells and modules, module buyers will be able to evaluate potential purchases with confidence, and financial stakeholders will benefit from the reduced risk that follows from that confidence.”
It might lead to effective mitigation or even the elimination of LETID effects, but the work will nonetheless continue, so the industry can fully understand the mechanisms behind the problem. In this project, the group found differing impacts on fill factor between modules, and significant variations in LETID between individual cells within single modules – neither of which it could immediately explain.

This was revealed by a reply from Huawei's smart PV business sector to inquiry from a China local media, which also revealed that the Chinese conglomerate and inverter maker shipped 2 GW of storage systems last year. In 2020, total PV inverter shipments totaled 41.7 GW.
Longi reported this week its revenue grew by 48% to CNY 80.9 billion (US$12.4 billion) in 2021. Its profit, however, declined by 6.2% to CNY 9.1 billion. The PV wafer and module manufacturer produced 70 GW of wafers last year, of which 33.9 GW were for internal use and 36.1 GW for external clients. Total module shipments reached 38.52 GW, lower than the 40 GW projects at the beginning of 2021. At the end of last year, the company reached production capacities for monocrystalline wafers, solar cells, and PV modules of 105 GW, 37 GW and 60 GW, respectively. The company estimates its 2022 module shipments will be between 90 and 100 GW and yearly revenues will reach over CNY 100 million.
Heterojunction (HJT) photovoltaics manufacturer Golden Solar has signed a one-year lease agreement, to start on July 1, with HJT cell maker JP-Solar Power (Fujian) Co Ltd for a 250 MW solar cell production line. With cast-mono wafer making facilities already in place, Golden Solar said in its annual report for 2021, published last week, cell and module production would form the next part of its transformation from a footwear manufacturer to a PV business.
Wafer maker Zhonghuan Semiconductor will change its name from Tianjin Zhonghuan Semiconductor Co., Ltd to TCL Zhonghuan Renewable Energy Technology Co., Ltd. The English abbreviation also changed from TJSEMI to TZE.
Solar developer Shunfeng has again postponed the release of details of a shareholder vote to consider the CNY 890 million ($135 million) sale of four PV projects with a total generation capacity of 132 MW. Details of the meeting were initially due on Jan. 28, but their release was last week postponed for a fourth time, until the end of May. Shunfeng revealed in its annual report for 2021, that the assets of one of the solar project businesses in question, Xinjiang Tianli, have been frozen by order of the Changzhou Intermediate People’s Court of Jiangsu province, complicating the projected sale process. In an additional wrinkle for Shunfeng, it also announced last week it had missed the four-month deadline for publishing its annual report, due to Covid-related restrictions in China. The numbers have now been promised on or before May 13.
State-owned solar panel glassmaker Luoyang Glass’ acquisition of a 60% stake in rival Qinhuangdao North Glass Co Ltd last year resulted in a non-recurring loss of CNY 108 million for its first-quarter earnings, which reduced net profit for shareholders by 97% from the CNY 136 million recorded in January to March 2021, to CNY 4.1 million in the first quarter this year. That result came despite this year’s first-quarter revenue rising from CNY 853 million in the first three months of 2021, to CNY 1 billion. Luoyang last week reported raw material and fuel costs rose 76% year on year for the latest first quarter reporting period, to CNY 893 million but finance costs fell 45%, from CNY 32.9 million to CNY 18 million and government grant income rose, from CNY 5.6 million in January- March 2021, to CNY 68.3 million.
The Xiangdao New Energy subsidiary of GCL New Energy‘s project development business wants to raise CNY 510 million by entering a 12-year sale-and-leaseback agreement with a state-owned leasing company to help pay down two loans. Xiangdao New Energy must settle CNY 188 million owed to Zhujiang Financial Leasing Co Ltd in November and owes the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd CNY 243 million by June 2024. The GCL subsidiary, which owns solar parks with a generation capacity of 161 MW and a book value of CNY 553 million, plans to transfer them to state-owned CR Leasing in return for CNY 510 million and will then lease them back – after paying a CNY 5.1 million handling fee – for 48 quarterly payments which, at the current interest rate of 5.9%, would cost CNY 15 million each. The proposal must be approved by GCL New Energy controlling shareholders Elite Time Global, which holds 49% of the stock, and Dongsheng Photovoltaic, which has 9%.
Manufacturer Solargiga wants to issue stock worth around 16.55% of ingot and wafer making subsidiary Qujing Yangguang to raise enough cash for the business unit to acquire a second Solargiga subsidiary from a third of the company’s business units. The parent last week said Qujing Yangguang would use CNY 255 million of the projected CNY 460 million proceeds of the share placing to complete the acquisition of ingot and wafer business Jinzhou Youhua from its Solargiga Energy unit. If shareholders approve the transaction, CNY 125 million of the cash will be used to purchase assets to expand Qujing Yangguang’s ingot and wafer production capacity, while the CNY 80 million balance will bolster the unit’s working capital. The move will dilute Solargiga’s holding in Qujing Yangguang from 53.7% to 44.81% but the company will remain the controlling shareholder.
State-owned utility China Energy Engineering has released first-quarter figures indicating the contract value of its photovoltaic project business had increased more than fourfold on the values recorded in January to March 2021. The company last week also highlighted new energy storage projects, including a 400 MW/800 MWh site in Youyou county, Shouzhou city, Shanxi province; a 200 MW/400 MWh facility at Yungang Tuobo Hengtai; and a 100 MW/200 MWh project in Ningchu Litong district.
Rooftop solar installer and battery manufacturer Comtec Solar announced an annual loss for shareholders of CNY 45 million from last year, in unaudited annual figures released at the end of March. That marked an improvement on the CNY 65.7 million shed in 2020 as the former solar manufacturer wound down its polysilicon and wafer production facilities, although revenue fell to CNY 54.8 million last year, from CNY 55 million a year earlier. Comtec ran down an inventory worth CNY 17.2 million in 2020 to CNY 3.16 million in 2021 and saw the value of its current assets fall from CNY 144 million to CNY 80.6 million over the same period. The latest figures stated the business had CNY 296 million more current liabilities than current assets in 2021, which marked a worsening in the working capital deficit of CNY 291 million which had been recorded in 2020.

Spain's Mondragon Assembly will supply a solar module production line to Netherlands-based module manufacturer Solarge B.V.
The equipment is an automatic line designed ad hoc and manufactured to produce light solar modules that have been developed by the Dutch company. The line will be installed in the third quarter of the year at Solarge's manufacturing plant in the Dutch municipality of Weert, and will start production by the end of this year.
Mondragon Assembly said that it developed the project in collaboration with Solarge. “All the key machines have been adapted to the customer's needs,” it said. “The new order means another step for Mondragon Assembly to establish itself as a provider of high-value technological solutions adapted to any application.”
Solarge manufactures a lightweight, 100% recyclable module without Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). It releases up to 75% less carbon during the manufacturing process, according to Mondragon Assembly. Solarge's module are lighter than conventional solar modules and ideal for rooftops with limited load capacity.
“The use of fiber-reinforced polymers by Solarge has allowed them to create the basis of a new patented technique for manufacturing lightweight photovoltaic modules,” Mondragon Assembly said, noting that this technique will allow Solarge to choose and use the best solar cells available.
Solarge's technology can be applied in agrivoltaic projects, floating PV arrays, and rooftop systems. It plans to expand the capacity of the production line to 380 MWp by 2024.
“Mondragon Assembly and Solarge hope to successfully launch this innovative technology as a new standard in the solar sector,” the company said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/06/how-grid-forming-inverters-may-enhance-grid-synchronization/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 6, 2022",How grid-forming inverters may enhance grid synchronization,"Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder have sought to assess how advanced control architectures and grid-optimization methods could ensure network synchronization in energy systems dominated by intermittent renewable energy sources.
In “Synchronization in electric power networks with inherent heterogeneity up to 100% inverter-based renewable generation,” recently published in Nature Communications, the US group analyzed how grid-forming (GFM) or grid-following (GFL) inverters can act as primary mechanisms to improve grid synchronization, especially during low-inertia operating conditions. They approached this in three main ways: heterogeneous coupling damping factors related to real-world power networks; a parametric sensitivity analysis highlighting the significance of the damping component; and the feasibility of grids operated by 100% inverter-based energy technologies with enhanced synchronization capabilities. They found that mechanical networks with small inertial mass and great damping characteristics show a higher capability for stable natural synchronization.
“This notion is intuitive as although the mass provides an inertial resistance to the acceleration of a body when subjected to force, it also creates an inertial resistance to slowing down the mass once moving,” they stated. “In addition, the higher damping capability allows the network to more effectively dissipate the kinetic energy produced by an external force.”
They also found that kinetic energy induced in the mechanical network is directly proportional to the inertial mass. The ability to dissipate the kinetic energy is also proportional to the damping coefficient.
“The assumption of homogeneity in the characteristics of subsystems, subnetworks, or components of an interconnected network is rarely valid for real-world large-scale networks; embedding such assumptions into an analytical model to study real-world, complex, interconnected networks may distort the findings,” they said.
The researchers said power systems based on GFM inverters ensure that the inertia and damping coefficients can be adaptively adjusted. But with power systems based on GFL inverters, inertia and damping coefficients are dependent on the machine design, they said.
“The GFM technologies can be generally categorized into virtual synchronous machine (VSM) and multi-loop GFM. Both technologies have a frequency response with dynamics that can be described by a second-order differential equation,” they said, noting that the multi-loop devices can provide damping support independent of the inertial contribution.
The researchers claimed to have provided a basis for the development of a control solution that could ensure the reliable, safe and stable operation of future power networks.
“To this end, it is pivotal to reconsider the control and automation systems currently in place, both the structure and algorithms, and perhaps design and implement modern control systems that are designed and tuned in accordance with the dynamic behaviors and characteristics of power networks with high levels of inverter-based generation,” the scientists concluded. “In future power networks dominated by grid-forming inverters, new concepts such as adaptive protection that follows the grid inertia to adjusts its settings in real-time, and generators’ available headroom reserve are factored into the determination of the droop value in real-time, making the grid a dynamically adaptive network and to do so, various control schemes can be utilized, especially highly distributed control systems.”

German conglomerate Bosch said this week that it will develop components for electrolyzers in the future.
The Stuttgart-based group wants to invest up to €500 million ($527.6 million) in the new business area by 2030. The particular focus will be on the development of the stacks for electrolyzers.
“Climate protection cannot wait. We want to support the rapid development of hydrogen production in Europe using Bosch technology,” said Stefan Hartung, CEO of Robert Bosch GmbH.
Markus Heyn, a Bosch board member and chairman of its mobility solutions division, said the group will draw on its fuel cell know-how. And the group sees huge growth opportunities. It expects the electrolyzer components market to reach a volume of around €14 billion by 2030, with the highest growth rates in Europe. Overall, it intends to invest about €3 billion in climate-neutral technologies over the next three years.
Bosch wants to develop electrolyzer stacks with control units, power electronics, and sensors for smart modules. It will also work with partners to achieve this. The smart modules will be delivered to manufacturers of electrolysis systems and industrial service providers from 2025. Bosch said the first pilot plant is scheduled to go into operation by as early as next year.
The group expects good economies of scale in the mass production of its electrolysis components.
“In addition to speed, costs are a decisive factor when ramping up hydrogen production,” said Heyn.
It wants to manufacture at various locations throughout Europe, including Bamberg and Feuerbach in Germany, Tilburg in the Netherlands, Linz in Austria, and Budweis in Czechia.
In addition to the electrolyzer components, the group is working on stationary and mobile fuel cells. The portfolio for vehicles ranges from individual sensors to core components such as electric air compressors and the stack to complete fuel cell modules. Series production is scheduled to start this year.

Japan’s Sumitomo Corp. will partner with Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto to develop a 2 MW green hydrogen production facility at the miner’s Yarwun refinery in the Australian state of Queensland, while exploring the potential of hydrogen as a replacement for gas in the alumina refining process.
The pilot project, which is expected to produce up to 300 tons of green hydrogen per annum, will also supply the Gladstone Hydrogen Ecosystem. The collaboration includes Sumitomo, Gladstone Ports Corp., the Gladstone Regional Council, Australian Gas Networks, and CQUniversity Australia.
Sumitomo said it want to explore opportunities to develop a hydrogen industry in the region. It will initially pursue domestic offtake and mobility solutions before moving to enable large-scale exports.
The ecosystem will be complemented by the use of hydrogen to replace gas in the alumina refining process at Yarwun, a project which Sumitomo Australia national hydrogen commercialisation manager Alana Barlow said could provide a pathway for reducing emissions in otherwise hard-to-abate industries.
“The project will produce up to 300 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum, but it is how that hydrogen will be utilised which is critical,” Barlow said. “50% of the hydrogen will be used to seed hydrogen ecosystem projects in Gladstone such as mobility. The other 50% will be used by Rio Tinto to test hydrogen in the alumina refining process at Yarwun to demonstrate over a 24-month period the tolerance levels of hydrogen blends with natural gas where we will provide up to 100% hydrogen. If successful, this demonstration will be a critical technological victory for reducing carbon emissions and optimising refineries.”
Barlow said the pilot project, and others like it, are crucial to the development of the hydrogen industry is Australia, saying players need to “show, don’t tell” the community about the benefits.
“It is critical to demonstrate the use of opportunities it presents,” she said. “Small-scale pilot and demonstration labs are essential to this. We need to help people prepare for and take advantage of impending opportunities.”
Rio Tinto said the green hydrogen pilot plant, which was first announced last year, is aligned with its emissions reduction targets. It said it will help to decarbonize the aluminium business, which is a heavy user of electricity.
“Rio Tinto has a long relationship with Sumitomo and we are delighted to partner with them to explore the possibilities of hydrogen, not only for our own refinery, but for Sumitomo to supply industry more broadly in Gladstone,” Rio Tinto Australia Chief Executive Kellie Parker said in a statement. “Reducing the carbon intensity of our alumina production will be key to meeting our 2030 and 2050 climate targets. There is clearly more work to be done, but partnerships and projects like this are an important part of helping us get there.”
The Sumitomo pilot project is among a suite of green hydrogen projects planned for the Gladstone area, including a massive “super-hybrid” project unveiled this week by Queensland developer Sunshine Hydro and Energy Estate.
Valued at up to AUD 5.5 billion ($3.9 billion), the Flavian project would incorporate 1.8 GW of wind generation and 600 MW of pumped hydro with 18 hours of storage. The project would also include 300 MW of hydrogen electrolyzers, 50 MW of liquefaction, and a 50 MW hydrogen fuel cell.
Sunshine Hydro Chair Michael Myer said once fully operational the Flavian superhybrid project will provide 65 tons per day of competitively priced green hydrogen for transport and local industry, as well as 220 MW of green energy being supplied 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.
“We will apply our innovative closed loop hydropower model, which selects of a clever mix of energy inputs, outputs, and storage, which we call a superhybrid, to generate reliable green power and green hydrogen,” he said. “The combination of the long-duration pumped hydro combined with the fast-acting response of PEM (polymer electrolyte membrane) electrolysers can provide grid services second to none.”

Indian state-owned SJVN has awarded an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for a 1 GW ground-mount solar project to Tata Power Solar.
The hydropower producer won the grid-connected PV capacity under the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) scheme in an auction conducted by the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), using the viability gap funding amount as a bid parameter. The solar project will be built in Bikaner district, Rajasthan. 
Tata Power Solar’s scope of work includes end-to-end delivery of the commissioned solar plant to SJVN. It will also be responsible for arranging land on an outright purchase basis, power evacuation systems up to the interstate transmission system (ISTS) substation, and operation and maintenance of the solar plant for three years.
The project development cost has been estimated at INR 5,492 crore. It is expected to generate 2454.55 million units of electricity in the first year of its operation and approximately 56,838.32 million units over 25 years. It is scheduled to be completed in 24 months from the awarding of the EPC contract – that is, by May 2024.

Maxeon Solar Technologies has released a holistic energy management system to interface with home solar arrays, battery energy storage systems, and the full set of energy loads in the home, including heating and cooling, appliances, and lighting.
The platform takes a step beyond monitoring the system, by proactively advising homeowners on ways to optimize their energy usage. It is capable of recognizing patterns of electricity consumption and suggests further actions for energy bill savings.
One example is the SunPower One system recognizing “always on” devices in the home that would benefit from switching off during periods of peak demand and high electricity prices. It can also identify malfunctioning appliances that may need repair or replacement based on abnormal electricity signals.
With compatible products, the system enables smart use cases that increase self-consumption of solar PV production, scheduling electric vehicle charging times for when excess solar is produced or stored, or running heating and cooling systems at cost and energy-optimal times.
“We expect the SunPower One solution will reimagine and revolutionize the consumer experience Beyond the Panel, keeping homeowners informed with actionable energy insights within their household, helping make their homes more efficient and more sustainable,” said Jeff Waters, CEO of Maxeon Solar Technologies.
Maxeon’s SunPower One will be packaged with the company’s SunPower Reserve home battery. The company said its group of integrated products will continue to grow over the course of the year, adding products like electric vehicle charging, and will unlock additional software capabilities for value-added services for the customer.
The system will also assist installers by reporting opportunities identified by the homeowner’s energy usage behaviors, making suggestions for more products and services for increased energy savings. The SunPower One tool also provides an installer-specific digital sales, design, and quoting platform.
“We have the freedom to think outside the box and leverage next-generation technologies to leapfrog the traditional offerings on the market today. Our customers are our north star, and we will continue to prioritize solving their pain points,” said Ralf Elias, chief product officer at Maxeon Solar Technologies.
Maxeon’s SunPower One platform will launch in Australia in third quarter of 2022 and will roll out to other markets globally throughout 2022. The United States and Canada will not be part of the 2022 launch. A demonstration of SunPower One will take place at Intersolar Europe on May 11 to May 13.
US expansion 
Maxeon made waves in the solar industry when it announced its Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) panel line is now supported by a 40-year warranty in its main distributed solar markets. The IBC cells feature back contact energy conversion, allowing the entire front of the cell to absorb sunlight without any shading from metal ribbons like the ones found in conventional solar cells.
According to Maxeon, these panels have a minimum warranted output of 98% during their first year of operation, followed by a maximum annual degradation of 0.25% for the next 39 years. The result is an 88.3% warranted power level at the end of 40 years.
In November 2021, pv magazine spoke with Mark Babcock, chief revenue officer of Maxeon, who indicated that Maxeon was considering manufacturing in the US, but he said that in order for that to happen a few federal policy changes would be needed.
Babcock said a 3 GW cell manufacturing facility in the US is waiting on an Energy Polict Act of 2005-established Title XVII loan from the US Department of Energy; it also may depend on the success of Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act. Such adoption would make US expansion a more attractive prospect to Maxeon, likely drawing in other industry players, as well, according to Babcock.
