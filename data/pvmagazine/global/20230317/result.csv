It will also launch an auction system by the third quarter with the EHB for renewable hydrogen production. It will support hydrogen producers via a fixed price per kilogram for a maximum of 10 operational years. The EHB will define financing mechanisms to create a continental hydrogen market, import hydrogen into the European Union, increase transparency, and coordinate with other institutions and private investors. The EU expects total hydrogen investment to reach €335 billion ($356 billion) to €471 billion, including €200 billion to €300 billion for additional renewable energy production.
Ceres Power has signed contracts with Linde Engineering and Bosch to jointly validate the performance, cost, and operational functionality of its SOEC technology. The companies said they plan to start a two-year, 1 MW SOEC pilot system in 2024 at a Bosch site in Stuttgart, Germany. Ceres Power is now testing its first 100 kW electrolyzer module and its initial results are providing confidence that this technology can deliver green hydrogen at less than 40 kWh/kg, which is purportedly 25% more efficiently than incumbent lower-temperature technologies. 
Saudi Aramco and Linde Engineering have agreed to jointly develop new-ammonia cracking technology. “A potential differentiator of this new technology is the ammonia cracking catalyst, jointly developed by Aramco and the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), which will be evaluated against other catalysts,” said Saudi Aramco. It will work with Linde Engineering to showcase the new ammonia-cracking technology at a demonstration plant in northern Germany.

“With the release of this data, we can finally put to bed the notion that heat pumps do not work in cold weather conditions and that they are inefficient to run,” said Marc Brown, interim business leader of Energy Systems Catapult. “We’ve observed the exact opposite. They are three times more efficient than gas boilers and work in cold weather conditions.”
The project is funded by the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, which commissioned Energy Systems Catapult, a non-profit net zero innovation center, to report on the data. A total of 742 air-source heat pumps were installed in detached homes, semi-detached homes, and terraced houses, as well as flats. The age of the properties spans from before 1919 to 2001 and later.
The heat pumps were installed by three delivery contractors – Warmworks, E.ON, and OVO Energy. Their performance was monitored from November 2020 to August 2022, with seasonal performance factors (SPF) indicating their in-situ efficiency over the course of 12 months. Results show a median SPF of 2.80 across heat pump types, operational patterns, and home types.
“This is a significant increase of around 0.3 to 0.4 (30% to 40%) since the Renewable Heat Premium Payment scheme (RHPP) heat pump trial was undertaken between 2011-14,” Energy Systems Catapult said in a statement, referring to an incentive scheme put in place by the UK authorities. “Innovation in the industry and in the heat pump systems themselves is likely a leading factor in this performance improvement.”
Figures also show considerable performance variation across heat pump models, with refrigerant and flow temperature being key culprits. The median SPF for heat pumps using R32 refrigerant was 2.94, followed by propane (R290) at 2.89, and R410a at 2.66. Their global warming potentials (GWPs) are 675, 3, and 2,088, respectively.
As for operating flow temperature, data shows that heat pumps that can reach temperatures above 65 C have median SPFs between 2.89 and 2.92, while low operating temperature heat pumps have SPFs between 2.74 and 2.94. However, the report says that “operating above 65 C is not a common occurrence, with 81 of the 94 heat pumps operative above 65 C flow temperature less than 1% of the time.”
The project also analyzed heat pump performance during the coldest days of the year in the UK, when mean external temperatures varied from -5.8 C to 2 C. Their coefficient of performance (COP) was calculated for each of the cold days, with a mean of 2.44.
“This result indicates that heat pumps continue to operate with high efficiency – providing the requisite heat to homes – in a wide range of property types even in cold weather conditions,” Energy Systems Catapult said.
Brown concluded that heat pumps have been shown to work.
“The UK is heat pump ready. Now we need to apply those learnings,” Brown concluded. “Government and industry should commit to investing in upskilling existing installers in low-carbon heating solutions and doing more to attract new talent into the sector.”

The governor’s office of South Carolina has confirmed Hounen’s plans. The company says the building will host 1 GW of solar module production lines.
“Our new solar panel production plant will enable us to produce monocrystalline silicon PV panels for the US market.” said Hounen CEO Jufang Ly. “We are grateful for the help and support of the South Carolina team and look forward to additional business opportunities in the state.”
Hounen Solar says the new factory will enable the creation of 200 new jobs. It is the third Chinese manufacturer to announce a new solar module factory in the United States since the introduction of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Earlier this week, Longi Solar and US solar project developer Invenergy agreed to jointly construct a 5 GW solar panel factory in Pataskala, Ohio, via a newly founded company, Illuminate USA. A press release from Illuminate USA says the plan will cost $220 million. Invenergy said it has invested $600 million in the facility.
In January, Chinese panel maker JA Solar unveiled a plan to build a 2 GW PV panel factory in the US state of Arizona. The solar cell and module maker said in a statement that it has already leased land for the manufacturing facility at an unspecified location in Phoenix, Arizona. The factory is expected to start commercial operations in the fourth quarter of this year, it said, adding that it will lead to the creation of 600 new jobs.

In early March, 2023, around 800 storage systems sold in Germany by Chinese manufacturer Sungrow were affected by an outage as a result of an automatic software update.
A spokeswoman from the company told pv magazine that the number of affected devices is accurate. The company said it regrets that “for a few of its customers” it is currently not possible to store the solar power produced in their photovoltaic systems. The company did not disclose how many storage systems it sold in the German market.
The manufacturer added that there is a solution to the batteries' issue, specifying that installers can contact the after-sales service, which would treat the request with the highest priority, the spokeswoman continued, without providing further details.
Meanwhile, several affected PV system owners have reported to pv magazine about the outages. Accordingly, the battery management system unit must be replaced if the storage devices fail.
The current issue of pv magazine focuses on the solar manufacturing technology enabling the new era of market expansion and high efficiency modules, including interdigitated back contact (IBC) and perovskite tandem solar cells. The magazine charts the latest technical and investment decisions in the high efficiency solar manufacturing segment and the materials and R&D underpinning them. Reports come in from France, Japan, India, Indonesia, Israel, England, the US, and China and we also examine the troubles of the solar-powered car pioneers.
Sungrow cannot currently estimate how long it will take for the replacement devices to be delivered. Letters to installers mention “probably in the next few weeks.” So far it has also not been decided who will bear the costs of installing the new device.
PV system owners contacting pv magazine are hoping for a quick solution. Sungrow recommends that its customers notify their installer when they notice their battery storage failing.

Called Solar Energy Optics (SEO), the patented film is able, according to the manufacturer, to reduce losses in the edge area of heterojunction solar cells. “By applying the SEO film to the inside of the HJT module front glass, light is redirected from the less efficient edges into the more efficient regions of the cells,” the company said in a statement.
The new product is still not available for sale. “We have just entered into pilot production phase with our latest SEO film generation,” the company's CEO, Keimo Kalliosaari, told pv magazine.
The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) tested the film on several panels based on different two different SEO configurations and M6 half-cut HJT solar cells with 1.7 mm cells and 2 mm string gaps. “The solar cells in the test were used out-of-the-box, without any additional modification or sorting,” the company specified.
According to Intelligent Control Systems, the test showed that the modules with the two different SEO architectures saw their power conversion efficiency increase by 0.66% and 0.75%, respectively, which it said corresponds to a 3.3 % and 3.8 % growth in power yield.
“The results show that the application of SEO film to a 120 or 144–cell module, with 2 mm cell gaps and a white backsheet, can provide an efficiency boost of 2.6 % relative improvement, or two power classes,” the manufacturer stated. “As an improvement on transparent bifacial modules or alternative to the gapless solution currently applied by some module manufacturers, the efficiency gains can exceed 3.5%.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/17/kesterite-solar-cell-with-transparent-electrode-achieves-11-4-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 17, 2023",Kesterite solar cell with transparent electrode achieves 11.4% efficiency,"Scientists from the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications in China have fabricated a thin-film kesterite (CZTSSe) solar cell that uses a transparent electrode.
Kesterite is one of the most promising light absorber material candidates for potential use in lower-cost thin-film solar cells. Kesterites include common elements such as copper, tin, zinc, and selenium. Unlike CIGS compounds, there are no supply bottlenecks expected in the future.
However, kesterite is still less efficient than CIGS in mass production. The world record for such cells is 12.6%, achieved by Japanese thin-film producer Solar Frontier in 2013.
“Our cell could be used in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and agrivoltaics, as well as in solar windows and facades,” researcher Hao Xin told pv magazine.
The researchers built the cell by using a transparent fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate coated with molybdenum (Mo) instead of commonly used substrates based on opaque Mo-coated soda lime glass. They also added a molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) layer between FTO and the precursor film to prevent the overgrowth of grains at absorber surface.
In addition, the researchers relied on sodium (Na) doping and silver (Ag) alloying to facilitate grain growth. They dissolved the absorber's compound in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution.
“The solution was spin- coated on FTO substrate to form precursor film, which was further annealed with selenium in a furnace tube to form CZTSSe absorber,” the scientists explained. “Then cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer was deposited on CZTSSe by chemical bath deposition.
The academics also deposited a window layer of intrinsic zinc oxide (i-ZnO) and indium tin oxide (ITO) by sputtering. They finalized the manufacturing process via the thermal evaporation of nickel (Ni) and aluminum (Al) top electrodes.
Under standard illumination condition, a cell with an active area of 0.103 cm2 and an antireflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2) achieved a power conversion efficiency of 11.43%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.522 V. It had a short-circuit current of 33.0 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 68.55%. China's National PV Industry Measurement and Testing Center at Fujian Metrology Institute (FJL) certified the results.
“The high efficiency and facile solution process of kesterite solar cells on transparent electrodes reported here open the door for this green and low-cost thin film technology to many advanced applications, such as semitransparent, bifacial, and tandem solar cells,” the scientists concluded.
The researchers introduced the cell tech in “11.4% Efficiency Kesterite Solar Cells on Transparent Electrode,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials. “For the time being, we have not estimated the production cost of cells, but we are sure that the raw materials involved in cell manufacturing itself are very cheap,” they said.

Household demand for rooftop PV systems and residential batteries continues to grow. In order to meet the expectations of homeowners, Verbraucherzentrale NRW – a German consumer association – is trying to clarify false expectations about PV installations that could disappoint prosumers.
“It is important to be aware of the personal goals of using photovoltaics and then to find out more. In this way, disappointments can be avoided and solar power can be used really efficiently,” said Sören Demandt, a digital energy transition analyst for Verbraucherzentrale NRW.
The first misconception is to promise people that they can become self-sufficient with PV systems and storage systems. This is not true, because PV systems and home storage solutions can only cover a certain proportion of annual electricity supplies for households.
The degree of self-sufficiency that can be achieved is between 25% and 90%, depending on the level of power consumption and whether storage has been installed. Especially in the winter months, the amount of solar power that can be generated is far from sufficient, so grid power has to be purchased, said Demandt. Complete self-sufficiency can only be achieved with additional seasonal storage, such as hydrogen.
“However, that is technically complex and hardly makes economic sense for a residential unit,” said Demandt.
Another misconception relates to the belief that a PV system is only worthwhile in combination with a battery. Some homeowners seem to believe that feeding solar power into the grid is not a financially attractive option.
“A photovoltaic system is financially worthwhile, even without storage,” said Demandt. “If installing a battery in addition to the photovoltaic system is doable, it depends on a number of factors – mainly, a home's consumption profile and electricity costs.”
Homeowners should therefore check their self-consumption levels without storage. They can compare higher self-consumption levels through battery storage with actual electricity costs.
Verbraucherzentrale NRW also rejects the idea that south-facing rooftops are always better for PV systems than east-west-facing rooftops. It's not just about generating as much solar power as possible, but generating electricity when it is needed. The annual yield of a PV system on an east-west roof is only around 80% compared to a south-facing roof. However, the yield from solar systems on east-west roofs can be spread over the course of an entire day, as the systems still get a significant amount of sun in the morning and evening.
Many people who do not have rooftops for PV installations often consider investments in plug-in solar devices. These can be attached to balconies or set up in gardens. However, if tenants hope to be able to power household appliances such as coffee machines, they may be disappointed.
“These panels are particularly suitable for covering the baseload in the household,” explained Demandt. “The electricity is used directly – for example, for a telephone, an internet router, or an alarm clock radio.”
If more power is needed, it will be provided by the grid. This is the case, for example, with a coffee machine that briefly requires around 2,000 W to heat up water. Balcony PV modules alone could not achieve this, according to Verbraucherzentrale NRW.

SEIA's vision and goal is that by end of this decade, the United States will be the most competitive, collaborative solar and energy storage industry in the world, and that will be accomplished with a workforce made up of American workers and its allies.
In “American Solar and Storage Manufacturing Renaissance: Managing the Transition Away from China,” SEIA points out that the move away from an over-reliance on imports for solar energy is beginning. And while we will not completely abandon global markets and supply chains, the momentum will build to the point where we can reduce our reliance on China for solar and energy storage equipment and raw materials.
SEIA reports that the United States has the capacity to produce many of the elements that are key to the solar industry: metallurgical grade silicon, polysilicon, steel, aluminum, resins, racking and mountings and other key materials. There is already a modest capacity to produce modules, inverters and trackers, and a limited source of domestic specialty glass. However, other elements have been missing almost entirely from the US supply chain, such as solar ingots, wafers and cells.
The US Inflation Reduction Act provides myriad incentives for the build out of US manufacturing, and it has effectively stimulated a number of companies to announce the intent to set up domestic manufacturing facilities. The buildout takes time, however, and for the next few years we will remain dependent on imports to fuel the rapid deployment of solar energy systems needed for the energy transition.
The largest source of solar cells and modules is currently Southeast Asia, which has manufacturing facilities run by manufacturers that have demonstrated the quality, financial stability, and compliance necessary to underwrite warrantees for their products demanded by US consumers.
While sourcing product from Southeast Asia is preferable to China, it means that the United States is still beholden to other countries to help fuel our energy transition. This presents risks, as witnessed by the supply chain challenges faced by Southeast Asia manufacturers over the past few years. According to SEIA, the best way to limit risks and build more resilient supply chains is to significantly expand domestic manufacturing.

Synergy, an energy generator and retailer owned by the Western Australian government, plans to install a 200 MW/800 MWh battery energy storage system alongside a 100 MW/200 MWh big battery that is currently being built at the site of the decommissioned Kwinana power station, south of Perth.
Synergy has submitted a development application to the Joint Development Assessment Panel for an estimated AUD 450 million ($300 million) grid-scale battery to be built alongside the 100 MW/200 MWh Kwinana Big Battery, which will start operations in April. It was originally anticipated that the battery would be operational by September 2022, but the project has been delayed due to problems associated with global supply chain issues.
Once completed, the Kwinana Big Battery will connect to the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS), the state’s main grid, and will have the capacity to power the equivalent of 160,000 homes for two hours. Synergy, which will operate and manage the battery energy storage system, said it will be a major component of its future asset mix, as Western Australia's state-owned coal power stations will be retired by 2030.
“Batteries are flexible, they provide grid stability and support the integration of more renewable energy into the network,” said Synergy Chief Executive Officer David Fyfe.
Fyfe said the Kwinana Big Battery and the proposed second energy storage systems are part of the utility’s commitment to deploy 1,100 MW of new large-scale storage by the end of the decade. It aims to ensure supply stability as the continued uptake of rooftop solar and renewables forces changes in the energy system.
Western Australian Energy Minister Bill Johnston has also backed the introduction of large-scale energy storage to support the integration of more renewable energy into the grid. He said it will smooth fluctuations in demand and renewable energy supply and substantially contribute to grid security and stability.
“Increasing energy storage over the next decade will be crucial to addressing system security risks, such as high levels of rooftop solar generation, and ensuring reliable power supply to Western Australia’s main electricity grid,” he said.
Synergy said construction of the second big battery will begin as soon as possible, after planning approval is received. The utility is already engaging potential suppliers and securing long lead items for the project.
The proposed Synergy big battery is one of a number of energy storage projects being pursued in Western Australia. The Australian unit of French renewable energy developer Neoen has filed planning documents to develop a 1 GW/4 GWh battery near the coal town of Collie in WA’s southwest and a 200 MW/400 MWh battery at Muchea northeast of Perth.
Victoria-based developer Sunshot Energy is also exploring large-scale energy storage, floating the potential for a 600 MWh to 800 MWh battery to be built as part of a proposed green hydrogen industrial hub near Collie, Western Australia.
