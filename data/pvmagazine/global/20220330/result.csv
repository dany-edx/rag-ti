The result came despite the fact revenue rose 8% to HK$6.02 billion (US$769 million), the company said.
The developer, abbreviated to Be Clean Energy, said that was because of one-off business impairments and options granted to investors in its Beiqing Smart pumped hydro business unit totalling HK$1.13 billion (US$144 million). Without that burden, the developer would have posted a profit of HK$839 million (US$107 million), Be Clean stated.
Be Clean said the rise in revenue was down to its wind power business but noted its solar plants generated electricity sales of HK$3.13 billion (US$400 million) last year, up from HK$2.85 billion (US$364 million) a year earlier, with the power selling from its 2,252MW of large scale solar plants for an average RMB0.77/kWh (US$0.12).
A proposed asset swap deal with third-party SEC Electric – which would have seen SEC take ownership of Beiqing Smart and list it in Shanghai, and SEC become part of Be Clean – fell through recently and the developer is waiting on a HK$4.69 billion (US$599 million) cash injection from public body China Shandong Hi-Speed, in return for 43% of a Be Clean enlarged by issuing the equivalent of 77% of its current stock.
Chinese manufacturer Solargiga, however, made a return to profit last year, of RMB193 million (US$30.3 million), following the RMB216 million (US$33.9 million) loss booked in 2020 as it began to wind down a cell production unit which cost it only RMB5.9 million (US$926,000) in 2021.
Solargiga booked revenue of RMB2.46 billion (US$386 million) from ingot and wafer production last year, up from RMB1.7 billion (US$267 million) a year earlier; RMB4.48 billion (US$703 million) from solar module sales, up from RMB4.27 billion (US$670 million); and RMB117 million (US$18.4 million) from solar project development, with its now-closed cell operation generating RMB44 million (US$6.9 million) in business.
The company’s raw materials bill rose from RMB186 million (US$29.2 million) in 2020 to RMB314 million (US$49.3 million) last year, Solargiga told the Hong Kong Stock Exchange yesterday, but, with all but 414MW of its ingots reserved for internal use, its freight costs fell, year on year, from RMB28.9 million (US$4.54 million) to RMB5.23 million (US$821,000), even as wafer shipments rose 30% to 4,087MW.
Price volatility meant Solargiga shipped fewer solar modules last year than in 2020, down from 2,865MW to 2,842MW. The manufacturer raised its annual production capacity for solar ingots and wafers at its Qujing fab, from 900MW each to 4.3GW and 2.5GW, respectively, and expects to hit 6GW and 3.6GW, respectively, this year.
Module capacity at its Yangcheng base will rise from 5.4GW, at the end of last year, to 6.4GW. The company said it had total production capacities of 5.7GW, for ingots; 4.1GW, for wafers; and 7.2GW, for modules, at the end of December.

A team of researchers from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) has developed a vanadium redox flow battery prototype to demonstrate its viability as a large scale stationary storage system for renewable energy sources.
According to the scientists, the 10kW/20kWh prototype could be used for either utility scale stationary applications or in residential and commercial projects.
“It is the first milestone on the way to obtaining a 50kW battery,” they stated, noting that the device is made up of four cell stacks similar to those that will comprise the 50kW battery.
The ultimate goal of the research project is to validate the 50kW prototype by connecting it to a renewable energy plant. An intelligent microgrid made up of a 10kW flow battery, a PV system, and various loads and programmable sources that allow different consumption, will be simulated.
The battery also incorporates a battery energy management system based on operation protocols compatible with industrial standards, with which the status of the battery can be analyzed at all times.
The researchers are also working on the implementation of techniques for the prediction of the state of charge to allow the efficient management of energy flows and the extension of the useful life of the device. “This pilot installation will allow the study of a business case according to the needs of the market, with a modular power architecture that allows the use of the battery in isolated mode or connected to the network, either in alternating or direct current,” said researcher Félix Barreras.
“We believe that this technology can help Spanish companies achieve a relevant position in the European environment in the face of the challenge of maintaining the security of supply in a decarbonized electricity system based on renewable energy,” said research co-author Clara Blanco.
The research project is being financed by the Next Generation EU fund, through Spain's Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan.

Switzerland is currently working on a reform of the incentive scheme for renewable energy, which will expire at the end of the year.
On Wednesday, the Federal Council in Bern started the new incentive mechanism that should come into force at the beginning of 2023 and apply until the end of 2030.
According to these new provisions, homeowners and businesses may be entitled to receive rebates covering up to 60% of the initial investment for buying and installing a rooftop PV system. For residential and commercial projects, the rebate may not exceed CHF450 ($485) per kilowatt installed.
For arrays exceeding 150kW, there will still be fixed feed-in tariffs which will be assigned through a tender scheme in a pay-as-bid process.
Furthermore, the Swiss government is considering introducing an additional incentive for PV systems with a tilt angle of at least 75 degrees. These systems, according to the Federal Office, produce a relatively large amount of electricity in the winter months and thus make a significant contribution to the country's security of supply. A bonus of CHF100 per kilowatt installed should be provided.
Also, for building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems, the bonus should be CHF250 Swiss francs per kilowatt installed, towards the higher installation costs. The bonus can also be combined with rebates.

The manufacturer said the result was confirmed by Germany's Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH).
“Longi’s R&D team has developed a p-type wafer processing solution for HJT cells and combined it with interface passivation technology to achieve an open-circuit voltage of 747.6mV for p-type HJT cells,” the manufacturer stated. “It should be noted that the processing of the low-cost p-HJT cell solution applied in this record has not yet been fully optimized and Longi is convinced that this technology route still has great potential for further development.”
Longi had achieved an efficiency of 25.19% for its p-type TOPCon solar cell in July and, a month earlier, a 25.21% efficiency for an n-type TOPCon device. It has also reached a 26.3% efficiency for its n-type HJT cell.

“The new series was originally launched in China in February and is now being launched on the European market,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine.
Called MOD 3-10KTL3-XH, the new product is available in eight different versions with nominal power of 3kW to 10kW. Their efficiency ranges from 98.3& to 98.6% and the European efficiency rating is between 97.5% and 98.1%.
The smallest device of the series measures 425x387x147mm and has a weight of 12.5kg. The largest inverter has a size of 425x387x178mm and weighs in at 14kg. 
It features up to two maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs, with MPPT voltage ranging from 140-1,000V.
The inverter can be used at a maximum operating altitude of 4,000 meters and its operating ambient temperature ranges from -25 to 60 degrees Celsius. The series also features IP66 enclosures.
“Such [a] battery-ready feature offers flexibility to users by allowing the inverter to work for a normal grid-tied solar system and later to be upgraded to a storage system with an extra battery pack, which saves users on initial investments,” said Lisa Zhang, global marketing director at Growatt.
The system is offered by the manufacturer with its ARK XH residential battery. “A MOD 10KTL3-XH inverter can provide 10kW full power output plus 10kW full power battery charge simultaneously, doubling the productivity of the system,” it said in a statement. “What is more, its DC/AC ratio is as high as two, and with dual MPP trackers, the string current can reach up to 16A, making it a good match with high-power modules.”

That was the message given by Innocent Uwuijaren, chairman of green hydrogen trade body the Africa Hydrogen Partnership, to an e-conference held by the Africa Solar Industry Association (Afsia) to consider the prospects of establishing production of the sustainable form of the energy carrier on the continent.

Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.

“If Africa will be able to maximize the opportunity ahead of us, the key thing is alliance,” said Uwuijaren. “We need to bond together under an alliance where countries work together under a unified platform and take the opportunity and maximize it in terms of technology, finance aspects, and creating local opportunities for young graduates in the hydrogen economy.”
The event was told obstacles must be overcome to establish a green hydrogen economy in Africa, including gaining access to the technology and sufficient finance, training a skilled workforce, putting in place supporting legislation and policy, raising awareness of the benefits of such an industry, and surmounting political and security risks.
But the rewards could be huge, with Uwuijaren highlighting the plans recently announced by the European Union to source an extra 10 million tons of imported green hydrogen this decade – over and above its previously stated target – to reduce dependency on Russian gas following the latter's invasion of Ukraine.
With some industry insiders having called for Africa to also establish industry further down the value chain, rather than simply exporting cheap hydrogen for use overseas, Uwuijaren pointed out African green hydrogen could be kept on the continent for use as an energy storage medium and to feed green fertilizer.
The Africa Hydrogen Partnership representative pointed to the string of hydrogen projects already being planned across the continent, including plans for production facilities in Egypt, Mauritania, and Namibia; for a cluster of projects in a “hydrogen valley” in South Africa; for an ammonia site in Morocco; and a feasibility study being carried out into a green fertilizer plant in Kenya.
Eric Dabe, senior sales advisor for Belgian mechanical engineer John Cockerill, told the Afsia event fears of a global shortage of gas are already prompting some energy-intensive industries to request electrolyzer capacity to produce green hydrogen as an alternative power source.
The Afsia e-conference was sponsored by the hydrogen unit of Chinese manufacturer Longi Solar, EU entity Get.invest; the Africa Hydrogen Partnership, and Paris-based Oenea Consulting.

Announcing a profit for shareholders of RMB5.08 billion (US$798 million) on Monday – following 2020's annual loss of RMB6.27 billion (US$985 million) – the poly maker pointed to certification achieved from a French government body in October that its granular silicon had a CO2 equivalent of 37kg for each kilogram manufactured, far exceeding the previous world record for polysilicon, of 57.56kg per kilo produced, according to GCL.
The latest edition of pv magazine investigates the rapid rise of TOPCon cell manufacturing. While not the only option PV manufacturers have their eye on, TOPCon is already the first n-type cell to claim significant market share. We chart the tech’s progress from laboratory to gigawatt production, plus efforts to standardize process flows, reduce costs, and raise performance.
The company said it had annual production capacity of 30,000 tons per year for the product at the end of December, in addition to 45,000 tons of capacity for its conventional rod silicon.
And with the manufacturer producing 47,610 tons of poly last year, and 38,118MW worth of solar wafers, GCL said its low-carbon granular silicon will swiftly enter the wafer supply chain and feed into solar components further down the line at a time when the European Union is preparing to introduce a carbon border which will apply penalties to imports which have heftier carbon footprints than European products.
GCL's annual report, published on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, also remarked how the Russian invasion of Ukraine has prompted governments around the world to reduce their reliance on Russian fossil fuels, in favor of renewables.
GCL-Poly last year recorded a 34% year-on-year rise in revenue, to RMB19.7 billion (US$3.09 billion), with its polysilicon and wafer manufacturing operation generating RMB16.7 billion (US$2.62 billion) of that, for a divisional profit of RMB5.53 billion (US$868 million). The company said it sold RMB8.46 billion (US$1.33 billion) worth of wafers to external customers, up from RMB5.69 billion (US$893 million) in 2020; and RMB5.96 billion (US$936 million) of polysilicon, up from RMB2.2 billion (US$345 million).
Its burgeoning solar materials business was helped by a reduction of debts at its GCL New Energy solar project development business, which sold 2.9GW of generation capacity to state-owned enterprizes last year as it attempts to pivot towards hydrogen.
GCL-Poly said its bank balance rose from RMB1.7 billion (US$267 million), at the end of 2020, to RMB6.7 billion (US$1.05 billion) a year later, and reported it has secured long-term orders for 700,000 tons of its granular silicon.

However, we are also focusing our efforts on the development of LEDs, using tin hybrid perovskite solar cells as light-emitting materials,” the research's corresponding author, Rafael Sánchez, told pv magazine. “Our investigation is being dedicated to enhancing the efficiency of the LEDs, tuning the color of the emitted light to cover other interesting spectral regions, and extending the device's lifetime under operating conditions.”
Sánchez explained that tin halide perovskites are currently being considered a valid alternative to, hazardous lead halide perovskites and that, however, solar devices built with these materials have so far proved to be less stable than their lead counterparts. “It is worth mentioning that tin-perovskite solar cells suffer from two severe limitations that limit, drastically, their performance, mainly: A reduced open-circuit voltage due to strong charge recombination processes; and limited operational lifetimes, which in most reported studies do not reach the 1,000 hours at maximum power point (MPP) conditions,” he emphasized, noting that these two drawbacks are intimately related to the inherent tendency of tin to be oxidized from Sn(II) into Sn(IV).”The challenge lies in elucidating whether these handicaps correspond to insurmountable intrinsic limitations of this family of materials or, contrarily, whether these weaknesses can be overcome upon a deeper understanding of the photo-electrochemical mechanisms involved and the exploitation of tailored additives that can enhance their functionality.”

The solar cell was built with formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3), sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as a reducing agent, and a bulky secondary ammonium cation of small size known as dipropylammonium iodide (DipI). “The reducing properties of NaBH4 play the role of preventing the oxidation of Sn(II) into Sn(IV) during the solution processing, which promotes an improved film crystallization and minimizes the number of crystalline defects,” the research group explained. “We have found that employing both additives induces a synergetic effect that leads to an efficiency of 10.61%, with an outstanding stability.”
The cell was able to retain around 96% of the initial efficiency after 1,300h. “Our strategy allows preparing FASnI3-based devices in a highly reproducible manner that reach long-term stability levels that have not been reported, to date,” the scientists explained.
According to Sánchez, the amount of materials required to assemble a complete device is rather low, which would undoubtedly contribute to reducing, even more, the costs, especially if this technology reached the mass production level. “Our devices are made of relatively cheap and abundant materials and are fabricated through solution processing methods, concepts that are very desirable toward the implementation of low-cost technologies,” he affirmed. “Our results unveil a new scenario in the tin hybrid-perovskite photovoltaics field and open up a new series of strategies to bring this technology a big step forward.”
The solar cell was described in the paper “Tin perovskite solar cells with >1,300 h of operational stability in N2 through a synergistic chemical engineering approach,” published in Joule.

“This is the highest light absorption ever demonstrated in such a thin Si membrane and it is, therefore, likely that flexible, lightweight, and efficient silicon photovoltaic cells will be developed in the near future,” the scientists stated.
The 1μm crystalline silicon membrane was designed with a patterned nanostructure able to redirect the sunlight into a range of angles and trap it in the membrane itself. Different hyper-uniform pattern designs were proposed in order to provide high design flexibility and good optical performance. “Not all nanopattern designs can be easily fabricated in a scalable manner,” the academics specified, adding that the experimental device was designed for the spectral range of 400 to 1,050nm.
Hyper-uniformity is a new methodology used to engineer light scattering and diffraction in a rational manner. Hyper-uniform disordered (Hud) patterns are flexible platforms that control light transport, emission, and absorption.
The simulated device was theoretically able to achieve an absorption equivalent photocurrent of 26.3mA/cm2. “The light absorption can potentially be increased up to 33.8mA/cm2 by incorporating a back-reflector and improved anti-reflection, for which we estimate a photovoltaic efficiency above 21% for 1μm-thick Si cells,” the scientists affirmed. “This means that thin Si cells with high efficiency could also be made from lower grade silicon, thereby reducing the energy needs for raw Si purification and reducing their energy pay-back time.”
The proposed approach is introduced in the paper “Over 65% Sunlight Absorption in a 1 μm Si Slab with Hyperuniform Texture,” published in ACS Publications. The research group also comprises scientists from Surrey University and Imperial College, in the United Kingdom.

A new deal between Fortescue Future Industries and E.ON will see the Australian company deliver 5 million tons of green hydrogen to Germany, the Netherlands, and multiple cities in Europe by 2030.
Fortescue magnate Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest has described the deal as “one of the world’s largest energy agreements.” He is setting Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) on a path to deliver approximately one-third of the calorific energy intake Germany currently imports from Russia.
The green, renewable hydrogen will primarily be produced in Australia and shipped to Germany in the form of ammonia. However, the company did flag plans to incorporate “FFI’s other planned global projects,” of which there are many.
The companies say they want to hit the 5 million ton target “as soon as possible.” Germany imports more than 60% of its energy demand, the bulk of which comes from Russia. The country has been badly caught out by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – a problem Forrest emphasised during his press conference.
To make 5 million tons of green hydrogen would require huge amounts of electricity – something Australia has the natural resources to deliver, as Forrest pointed out. “We have enough energy in Australia from a tiny, tiny fraction of our landmass to power all the world,” he said.
E.ON has around 50 million customers, primarily in Germany and the Netherlands. FFI’s green hydrogen will be delivered to them with a specific focus on “medium-sized industrial customers in the regions,” which is where E.ON COO Patrick Lammers said the company is expecting the most hydrogen demand.
With a company target to produce 15 million tons of green hydrogen by 2030, FFI has spent the last year making moves to vertically integrate itself. It plans to open the world’s largest electrolyzer production plant in Queensland, which appears to be powering ahead after securing state government approval and network operator cooperation. The company also plans to build a 1 GW solar PV module manufacturing plant, but the location has not been confirmed.
Fortescue is quickly becoming one of the biggest prospective green hydrogen producer in the world. It has been signing partnership agreements at an equally rapid pace, including a recent deal with Airbus.

Timo Leukefeld GmbH has started selling a new hot water tank and heater in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
The boiler relies on two AC heating rods and uses excess solar power from rooftop PV systems to generate domestic hot water. It is available in capacities of 125 liters, 160 liters, and 200 liters,
“With our boiler, homeowners can raise the overall self-sufficiency in terms of heating, water heating and electricity by five to ten percent, which is a considerable increase in apartment buildings,” said the company's owner, Timo Leukefeld. “We achieve a degree of self-sufficiency of around 70% a year in domestic hot water production.”
Leukefeld said the boilers can be used in combination with PV systems. Homeowners can operate the first heating element with 2kW of power and the desired temperature can be set on thermostats. The second heating rod, which also has an output of 2kW, is operated via a PV system and is controlled by a timer.
The timer is set so that from March to September, excess solar power is used to heat water up to 70 C between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. The other heating element only switches on when the temperature in the boiler falls below 50 C. This allows homeowners to replace expensive grid power with excess solar power.
The boilers are made of sheet steel and are coated with enamel on the inside. Depending on the space that is available, they could be installed in bathrooms.
“Due to the short pipework and small amounts of water, water heating is also much more hygienic,” said Leukefeld.
The self-sufficient boilers are also designed to reduce long-term ancillary costs as much as possible.
“The challenge is to achieve a real solar coverage of more than 50% for heating, hot water and household electricity,” said Leukefeld. “A hot water boiler that is able to primarily use excess solar power to heat shower and drinking water can make a significant contribution to energy independence.”

The new era of the power grid may be characterized by large power plants and sprawling transmission lines, but also by local, flexible energy sources. This is the vision that venture capitalist Bill Nussey outlines in “Freeing Energy.”
He sees billion-dollar opportunities for innovators that can reimagine how energy is created, stored, and delivered. This new grid concept is already underway, and the latest example is the collaboration between Vermont utility Green Mountain Power and energy storage specialist Enphase.
The two companies have said that Green Mountain Power will offer Enphase batteries at a significant discount in a pilot lease program. Enphase will provide 100 eligible customers with two Enphase IQ Battery 10 units for $65 per month for 10 years, or for a single payment of $6,500. That cost does not include installation. Homeowners benefit from reliable backup power, while also sharing stored energy during times of high demand to help reduce overall costs for all GMP customers.
“With the new IQ8 microinverters, our customers will be able to easily expand their home battery system over time, giving them even more peace of mind about their energy future. This partnership allows the homeowners, local contractors, and utilities to use Enphase’s state-of-the-art technology to help create a more reliable, affordable, and cleaner grid for all of Vermont,” said Liam Madden, director of solar energy at HB Energy Solutions.
Green Mountain Power has another virtual power plant offering, the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) program. Under BYOD, upfront payments of up to $9,500 are offered depending on the capacity of the systems enrolled. Green Mountain Power said homeowners that retrofit an existing solar system in one of the areas of the state where battery power is needed most may be eligible to receive an extra $100 per kilowatt.
Program participants will be enrolled for a term of a minimum of 10 years. The Enphase batteries are lithium ferro-phosphate (LFP) chemistry batteries, which the company said provide a long life cycle and better safety through thermal stability. They are equipped with a feature to seamlessly power up air conditioners and well pumps in the event of grid power loss. The batteries come with a 10-year limited warranty.
Enphase is also launching Grid Services Manager, a distributed energy resource management system that Green Mountain Power will use to manage the virtual power plants. Enphase said it plans to offer this software to utility grid managers and distributed energy resource aggregators in the future.
