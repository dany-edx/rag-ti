https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/17/the-world-installed-240-gw-of-solar-in-2020/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"APRIL 17, 2023",Global solar installations hit 240 GW in 2022,"Understanding the energy transition requires a documented approach, especially when reporting PV capacities, as evolving assumptions change our comprehension of markets. Estimating the newly installed PV capacity is becoming an increasingly complex task, but good quality data is essential to develop an understanding of market trends and long-term evolutions. Without reliable, accurate and pertinent information, policymakers, decision makers and industry stakeholders may not be equipped to respond to market trends according to their strategic goals, such as adapting policies, planning grid expansions, and maintaining system stability.
For several years now, contradictory information has been published on market and market growth estimates. It is to be expected that the distributed nature of PV renders establishing these estimates complex and subject to interpretation, especially as PV development in countries with a reduced ability to track and report PV installations is growing. But the consequence of this difficulty for international organizations and consultancies to report similar numbers is a reduction in confidence in market numbers and subsequently in the PV industry in general.
For the year 2022, capacities between 192 GW (IRENA) and 268 GW (BNEF) have been published, and the reality surely lies somewhere in between: IEA-PVPS considers that 240 GW is a decent approximation of the real installation value, counted in Watt-Peak or DC installed capacity. While IRENA refers to AC numbers (or the power output of the inverters, or the grid connection when the information is available), IEA-PVPS reports DC numbers, or the nominal power of the PV modules. Whilst AC and DC numbers are both representative of a reality, DC numbers facilitate calculating energy output, whereas AC numbers refer to the theoretical maximum power output of PV plants.
That AC-DC discrepancy is at the core of numerous misunderstandings in the reporting of PV capacities, and it can be difficult to gain a clear picture of what markets look like. Most recently, Chinese sourced announced in 2022 that their reporting was AC – not DC as international experts had understood, changing final installation numbers by a significant factor:
The China National Energy Administration indicated 87 GW was installed in China in 2022, while the Snapshot of Global PV Markets 2023 by IEA-PVPS indicates 106 GW, an estimate based on AC-DC ratios in China’s utility-scale PV plants.
Given this seemingly wide range of values for data points published by serious, reputable organisations, it can be difficult to decide whose data to use. As a general rule, where two quite different figures are published, it is likely that one organisation publishes DC capacity and the other AC capacity, but what other factors should be considered?.
Many factors can influence how new annual or cumulative PV capacity is reported – there is no international reporting framework for PV – and each country has its own reporting conventions with differences depending on who is collecting data and the purpose of the data collection. In many emerging markets, off-grid or edge-of-the-grid installations are often unreported. Distributed applications cannot always be tracked properly, and conventions add uncertainty to the numbers.
Why does IEA-PVPS select DC numbers? Electricity generation and market turnover, PV module surfaces and land usage are more closely correlated to module DC power than system AC power. Of course, other factors must be taken into account when extrapolating from these values, such as soiling for electricity generation (see the IEA-PVPS 2022 Task 13 Soiling Losses – Impact on the Performance of Photovoltaic Power Plants Report) or average system costs in different segments for market turnover (see the IEA-PVPS Task 1 National Survey Reports for participating countries).
A margin of uncertainty remains even with data from primary and trusted sources as national experts and analysts have in some cases converted AC capacity to DC, whilst different reporting conventions can mean that repowered and decommissioned capacities are counted differently, or not at all. Micro systems (plug&play) may not be reported in some countries, and it is often the same for off grid systems. In countries with less robust data collection methods, approximate sources and expert guesses give an adequate view considering the low overall volumes involved.
The recently released Snapshot of Global PV Markets 2023 by IEA-PVPS is built on data supplied by country and international experts, inhouse data collection and analysis from report authors, counting both grid-connected and off-grid when numbers are reported, estimating unreported installations and converting installation capacity data to DC. The Snapshot aims to supply coherent, accurate and useful data allowing comparison between countries and across the years.
Growing market
The 240 GW reported this year are an estimate based on the best existing numbers, covering a large part of the global PV market. However, uncertainty exists and should be considered. Compared to the 175 GW installed in 2021, the growth of the PV market could already be considered consistent with the perceived increased interest in solar energy. Reality goes further as by the end of 2022 at least 44 GW of PV was shipped but kept in inventories for future installation. Production numbers for cells and wafers were in the 300 GW range, indicating strong manufacturing confidence in market growth.
The delays seen in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic and its impact on PV production and installation has been at least partially compensated in 2022 but will have an impact in 2023 as well, where a much faster growth rate than real installation numbers is expected.
To ensure informed decision making, it is important to choose the right data source, and understand its limitations and advantages. As an early look at last year’s global PV markets, the Snapshot provides readers a quick overview of markets and policy trends that will be investigated in more depth in “Trends in PV Applications,” to be published in the fourth quarter of 2023. With around 240 GW and more in inventories, ready to be installed, the growth of the PV market is accelerating fast, while inadequate reporting is clouding the perception of that growth.
A more robust methodology at national level, especially in emerging countries to track and report PV installations would support the energy transition. A real cooperation between agencies would also support a better reporting and avoiding competing numbers, while the complexity of the entire energy ecosystem is growing.

“Our system can be deployed in parking areas without reducing the capacity of parking lots,” the CEO of Luxor Solar K.K., Uwe Liebscher, told pv magazine.
The Vertical Solar System for Parking Area (Verpa) new system is based on vertical racks supplied by Germany's Next2Sun and heterojunction photovoltaic modules manufactured by Luxor Solar.
“The height from the ground surface to the bottom of the module is more than 2 meters,” Liebscher explained. “This ensures electrical safety due to its height as well as offering a safer solution for drivers while requiring a minimum on-ground space.”
The two companies claim the system is ideal for locations with heavy snowfall. “It also offers competitive installation and maintenance costs, easy cleaning and maintenance,” said Liebscher.
The system is sold in 920 W units measuring 2,280 mm x 4,633 mm and combining two 460 W bifacial modules. The unit can be configured in a 13-unit system with a total power output of 35.88 kW.
“There is no significant difference in annual power generation compared to flat and inclined types, adjustable output peaks, and use of reflected light,” Liebscher said, in reference to PV potentially offering better electricity yields at higher latitudes.
AirWater and Luxor Solar K.K will start selling the new product in Japan in May. They build their first 25.2 kW demonstrator with SolarEdge optimizers in Sapporo, Japan.
“In Japan, there is already a shortage of suitable land,” Liebscher said. “On the other hand, heavy snowfall areas, which cover 51% of the country, have been considered unsuitable for solar power generation.”

“This new product … is easily expandable for applications with high power needs, limited installation space, and limited load-bearing capacity,” Bslbatt said in a statement.
The PowerCube-5 battery measures 670 mm x 475 mm and is 89 mm thick, purportedly making it the “thinnest rack battery in the world,” according to Bslbatt.  It weighs 48.3 kg.
The lithium-iron system has a storage capacity of 5.12 kWh and a nominal voltage of 51.2 V.  It uses LiFePO4 as the cathode material and has an ambient operating temperature range of -20 C to 65 C.
“The battery is easily expandable, allowing it to be configured in parallel or in series to meet specific power requirements,” the manufacturer said. “The ultra-thin battery series of Bslbatt is particularly suitable for applications with high power needs, limited installation space, limited load-bearing capacity, and long cycle life.”
It comes with a 10-year warranty and can purportedly operate for more than 8,000 cycles. It also features IP22 protection.
In November, Bslbatt launched the first product in its ultra-thin series, a 90-mm-thick wall-mounted battery.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/17/fraunhofer-ise-showcases-bipv-solar-thermal-facades-for-heat-pumps/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HEAT PUMPS,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,GERMANY,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"APRIL 17, 2023",Fraunhofer ISE showcases solar thermal facades for heat pumps,"Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE has developed a facade for buildings that absorbs heat from solar radiation and ambient air. It uses that heat as a source for residential heat pumps.
The Tabsolar invention consists of solar thermal panels made of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC). Each panel is interspersed with multiple-branched cylindrical hydraulic tube channels with a solar fluid that absorbs heat. A heat exchanger transfers this heat into the heat pump circuit.
“The design of the channel structures is created using the bionic FracTherm process developed by Fraunhofer ISE, which produces a multiple branched (or fractal) pattern similar to the veins found in leaves or the human body,” the research institute said in a statement. “Using this process, it is possible to create an evenly distributed network of channels across almost any shaped panel, which ensures uniform flow distribution and also a lower energy consumption rate for the pump.”
The solar thermal panels measure 1,683 mm x 1,040 mm, corresponding to an area of 1.75 m², according to Tabsolar’s website. They are available in glazed and unglazed versions. The unglazed variant is intended as a heat source for heat pumps heating domestic hot water or swimming pools. It can be designed in different colors and with other surface structures. The glazed panels with spectrally selective coatings can reportedly generate higher temperatures and are therefore designed to be used for domestic hot water heating and backup heating, similarly to conventional solar thermal collectors.
“Our simulations suggest that both new builds and older retrofitted building stock would have sufficient facade space for this purpose,” said Dr. Michael Herman, coordinator for the Tabsolar III joint research project and project manager at Fraunhofer ISE. He noted that the project aims to show that the BIPV solution is a noiseless, space-saving alternative to external air units for air-to-water heat pumps.
The prefabricated Tabsolar panels have been developed for suspended rear-ventilated façades (VHF), but they could potentially be adapted for composite exterior insulation and finish systems or sandwich wall systems, according to Fraunhofer ISE. The panels can also be installed inside buildings as thermally activated building systems (TABS) for heating and cooling.
Fraunhofer ISE is showcasing its Tabsolar panels at the BAU trade fair for architecture, materials, and systems, from April 17 to April 22 at Messe Munich. The Tabsolar III research project is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) and is supported by several partners.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/17/new-nickel-manganese-cobalt-battery-for-maritime-applications/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NETHERLANDS",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"APRIL 17, 2023",New nickel-manganese-cobalt battery for maritime applications,"EST-Floattech has unveiled a new nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery storage system for maritime applications.
“The new system is suitable for virtually any on-board purpose; from propulsion (full-electric, hydrogen-electric, diesel-electric, etc.) to peak shaving, auxiliary power, and more,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The scope of this battery system extends to all maritime (niche) markets, e.g. ferries, aquaculture power supply, container ships, inland shipping tankers, motor and sailing yachts, workboats, crew suppliers, offshore wind support vessels, naval vessels, dredgers and many more.”
The Dutch maritime energy storage specialist said that the Octopus line includes its battery management system, which can be integrated with a range of battery configurations and chemistries. The company currently offers two versions of its NMC battery modules – the High Energy and the High Power variants. The former has a nominal voltage of 52 V and a capacity of 192 Ah. A single battery module has a capacity of 10 kWh and measures 709 mm x 582 mm x 248 mm, with a weight of 86.5 kg.
“The High Energy batteries are designed for long-duration and large-scale battery installations, making them ideal for medium- and large-sized ships that sail electrically and charge during the night, for example,” said EST-Floattech.
The High Power batteries have short charge and discharge times and can be used in fast-charging ferries that make short trips. They have a nominal voltage of 52 V and a capacity of 112 Ah. A single battery module has a capacity of 5.8 kWh, measures 709 mm x 582 mm x 248 mm, and weighs 82 kg.
Up to nine battery modules can be stacked together. A High Energy system with three strings connected in parallel and 12 modules per string reaches a capacity of 360 kWh, while a High Power system has a capacity of 208.8 kWh.
In addition to a fixed configuration, the Octopus Series is available as a 10- or 20-foot containerized solution that can be placed on different types of vessels.
The battery modules are IP65 rated and have DNV type certification. EST-Floattech claims they have more than 10 years of life. The company is also developing technology with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry.
“The market is growing, to improve sustainability and due to goals set by regulations,” said Walter van der Pennen, CCO of EST-Floattech. “The energy transition in the maritime market has really started, and in the past few years there has been an increase in electrically powered vessels. As a result, you see more and more differentiation in the applications needed by shipowners and shipbuilders, not only for direct propulsion but also for various equipment, machinery, peak performance and hotel loads.”
The system was fully developed in Badhoevedorp, Netherlands.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/17/n-type-tiger-neo-panels-driving-strong-demand-and-growth-for-jinkosolar/,"SPONSORED,WORLD",,"APRIL 17, 2023",N-type Tiger Neo panels driving strong demand and growth for JinkoSolar,"Dany Qian: In 2022, JinkoSolar delivered over 44.5GW of solar panels (including 10GW of our n-type Tiger Neo modules), representing 87% YoY growth for n-type panels. It was our best year ever on every level in the face of massive difficulties like soaring polysilicon prices, forced shutdowns, very high interest rates, and many delivery challenges.
Dany Qian: With respect to the n-type Tiger Neo module, it is expected to reach a 60% share for the year to date. This is a huge milestone for the PV industry, as almost all tier 1 players are currently transitioning to n-type TOPCon modules. We’ve seen strong demand so far, and we are currently seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production.
Dany Qian: That is currently not in our plan, but we will definitely give priority to those customers who secure their orders earlier. We are ramping up production of our n-type products, and we expect manufacturing to grow at a much faster rate this year.
Dany Qian: Rather than focusing on the cost per watt, what really makes a difference for a vast number of customers nowadays is energy density, the rated power, and generation performance (kWh per kW). We're also making very good progress on cost control commensurate with the growth in production.
Dany Qian: We are taking the view that we want to keep making and selling as many Tiger Neo modules as we can. We believe we can keep pushing for strong volume growth while retaining the industry's best n-type products in every category. And really, R&D and manufacturing technologies will be our most important long-term strength.

Dany Qian: I think we're pretty well-positioned to take advantage of n-type TOPCon technology becoming mainstream over the coming years.
Dany Qian: We are looking at mass-produced module efficiency over 23% on average in the near future, as well as a rated power output of up to 615 watt-peak (Wp) for 72 cells. JinkoSolar also expects to further reduce the temperature coefficient, along with other technological advancements.
Dany Qian: Every time we sell a Tiger Neo panel, it has the ability to provide an all-around improved reliability and performance for any scenario ─ just from its higher efficiency, the increased capacity (watts) per square meter, and the additional power generated (kWh) per watt. And we expect the value and yield gain for n-type over p-type products will grow as time goes on.
Dany Qian: Our 2023 goal as a factory team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp up for n-type products well ahead of our competitors. The areas we are focusing on include improving the efficiency and rated power of panels, tightly controlling the quality of the supply of high-volume materials, and driving factory process yields up as much as possible.
Dany Qian: On the raw materials and inflation side ─ where the price of polysilicon is the large driver and could be a meaningful source of increased costs for us ─ we'll have to see where polysilicon prices continue to go in Q2. And we're not only exposed to the fluctuations of polysilicon prices, but also to the costs of high purity quartz crucibles. It is certain that we will continue to find ways to offset any increases in these raw material costs.
Dany Qian: We have priced our products with a view toward a longer-term cost structure. And we expect our margins to remain healthy over the course of the rest of the year.

The CEC has awarded $3 million to NEXT Energy Technologies. The Realizing Accelerated Manufacturing Production for Clean Energy Technologies (RAMP) grant is expected to help the company to accelerate the production of its photovoltaic coating, which can be applied to commercial windows to turn them into electricity-producing surfaces.
The purpose of RAMP is to provide financial assistance to help clean energy entrepreneurs successfully advance their innovative technologies by reaching initial manufacturing readiness levels. NEXT plans to use the funds to fund the scale-up of a low-rate initial production line for the assembly of solution-processed organic photovoltaics for commercial windows.
“The funding provided is vital to startups like ours that are focusing on manufacturing at the next level. Our goal is to help commercial buildings achieve net-zero energy and reduce their carbon footprint, and we are working with innovative partners to demonstrate how this technology can grow in the future,” said Daniel Emmit, chief executive officer of NEXT Energy Technologies.
The company's photovoltaic coatings are applied during the window fabrication process, integrating with established manufacturers without disrupting workflows and supply chains. NEXT said its approach removes costs typically associated with packaging and installation of solar.
NEXT said a typical commercial high-rise office building installed with its first-generation windows could offset as much as 10% to 20% of the building’s power needs. Over a 30-year period, the building could produce 20 million kWh of clean energy, saving an annual average of $170,000 on utility bills, said the company.
“RAMP is really a visionary program,” said David Hochschild, chair of the CEC. “It is providing value, not just for our clean energy goals, but also ultimately for ratepayers because it is helping to drive down the cost of these technologies.”
The latest issue of pv magazine takes a look at how the long-established link between solar and cannabis cultivation can help improve margins as medicinal and recreational use of the drug comes out of the weeds. We take a trip Down Under to examine why communities are rebelling against planned renewable energy zones perceived as being railroaded through without sufficient local consultation, and we consider the “solar crime” wave sweeping the UK and Europe.
A team of National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) researchers have discovered that highly glazed skyscrapers can reduce their energy use and associated carbon emissions by 40% with solar windows. Lance and Vincent Wheeler developed a new open-source software, available on GitHub, called PVWindow to model the potential impact of the technology.
“Picture a skyline in, like, New York City where there are these high-rise buildings that are entirely glass,” said Lance Wheeler. “They’re fully glazed. The Freedom Tower has millions of square feet of glass. It could be a power plant in itself.”

UK renewables developer Island Green Power, under the Rangiriri Solar Farm Project and Waerenga Solar Farm Project names, has announced plans to develop two new solar projects on the North Island of New Zealand.
The proposed 180 MWp Waerenga Solar Farm and 130 MWp Rangiriri Solar Farm are expected to respectively generate about 220 GWh and 300 GWh of clean electricity per year. State-owned utility Transpower, the owner and operator of the national grid, has been named joint applicant, as it handles the associated infrastructure.
The projects have been referred to an independent fast-track consenting panel, which provides for an accelerated consenting process for projects with the potential to boost economic activity and contribute to New Zealand’s efforts to speed up the rollout of renewables as it strives to reach net zero by 2050.
Environment Minister David Parker said the Fast-track Consenting Act, introduced to accelerate infrastructure development, lets ministers send projects straight to the independent panel, which is administered by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA).
Parker said the process allows for the panel to consider the consent, a reduced number of parties that can make submissions and a shorter consenting process with the fast-track process reducing consenting time by “an average of 15 months per project saving infrastructure builders time and money.”
“These projects are examples of the type of renewable energy development needed to meet our environmental goals, and increasing generation and supply improves our national energy resilience,” he said. “The permanent fast-track consenting process is a crucial part of our plan to reduce emissions and improve our economic security by increasing domestically generated renewable energy.”
