Many different possibilities exist as to the form these commercial products could take, and the materials they could contain. And it's likely that more than one option could prove commercially viable.
Scientists led by the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland designed one possible process for the production of single-junction perovskite modules. They modeled all of the associated costs for manufacturing and installation of modules produced on a 100 MW production line based on their processes.
They described the production line and modeling in full in “Design and Cost Analysis of 100 MW Perovskite Solar Panel Manufacturing Process in Different Locations,” published in ACS Energy Letters. The group compared various material and processing options and found that a tin-oxide electron transport layer coupled with silver paste electrode would yield the lowest production cost and energy consumption, of the options compared in the study.
The group also calculated the minimum sustainable price, levelized cost of energy, and energy payback time for various locations. On the manufacturing side, they noted significant regional differences in the cost of processing glass, while their energy cost and payback calculations were largely affected by different land, labor and energy costs between regions, as well as climate conditions for installation.
The model predicts that a 100 MW perovskite production would require approximately 5.6 kWh of electricity per square meter of module. Based on installation in sunny locations such as Spain or Egypt, it could achieve an LCOE between $0.03/kWh and $0.04/kWh, reaching energy payback in a little over six months.

A spokesperson for the Volgograd regional government told pv magazine on condition of anonymity that the project's investor, JSC Solar Systems, has said that construction would not start this year, as initially planned, due to an inability to source critical imported equipment.  
The spokesperson said that the investor could have opted for alternative technologies, but decided to put the project on a halt instead, “until things settle down.”
In July, another anonymous source told local news outlet V1 that the investor was forced to delay construction due to a lack of foreign components, including some that were to be purchased from Schneider Electric Global.  
Sergey Kopytov, the head of the Danylovsky region of Volgograd, said that following consultations with the investor, the regional authorities held a tender and passed the land for the project over to a local agricultural producer for the next three years.  
Kopytov confirmed that construction was suspended due to Western sanctions. JSC Solar Systems will only be able to resume development once the rental contract expires in 2025. However, it remains uncertain whether the plant will be built when it happens.

Of the 546 MW added, 225 MW correspond to utility scale solar projects, while the remaining 321 MW resulted from the installation of self-consumption production units, both in households and in the commercial and industrial sectors, a spokesperson for the Portuguese Association of Renewable Energy (APREN) told pv magazine.
In 2021, the country installed around 570 MW of new solar capacity. It has therefore added almost as much new solar in the first half of this year than it did in all of 2021.
Figures that were released in February put new solar capacity additions for 2021 at 701 MW, but they have since been updated. In 2020 and 2019, new additions hit 151 MW and 252 MW, respectively.
Portugal’s cumulative PV capacity reached 2.19 GW by the end of June. Solar is the technology with the greatest growth in installed capacity in relative terms, going from 299 MW in 2013 to 2192 MW in 2022, up 633%.
The Portuguese 2030 National Plan for Energy and Climate (PNEC) establishes a goal of 6.6 GW total PV capacity  by 2025 and 9 GW by 2030. At present, around 3.45 GW of solar projects have received production licensing, but not operating licensing, according to DGEG figures. “Considering the current rate of evolution of PV plant installations, reaching the 9 GW target by 2030 will only be possible if the difficulties inherent in the licensing processes are overcome,” said an APREN spokesperson.
Overall, around 16 GW of renewable energy capacity is currently operating in Portugal, most of which is represented by hydropower at 7.35 GW and wind energy at 5.64 GW. While hydropower remains the country’s top source of renewable energy in absolute terms, its annual production fell by 38% between June 2021 and June 2022. Solar’s annual production grew by 27% over the same period.
Solar generation hit its highest point ever in July, accounting for 9% of the country’s total electricity production, according to figures from APREN. The country also broke its previous records in June and May, when solar accounted for 8.6% and 8.2% of total generation, respectively.

Residents of the Australian state of New South Wales are now able to buy a Haystacks Solar Garden “plot” to secure an estimated AUD 505 ($340) annual credit on their electricity bill, providing renters and apartment dwellers with a similar experience to having their own rooftop solar systems.
The 1.5 MW solar system will be located on farmland in Grong Grong, near Wagga Wagga. The project, which has been many years in the making, aims to give Australians a community-owned solar model, which is already common in Europe. The objective now is to secure 333 solar “gardeners” for each of the project’s plots, who will all be members of the Haystacks co-op. Once their one-off payments have been collected, the construction of the solar farm will begin.
With the help of partnering organizations, the co-op will build and own the solar project. Each member will then get the same return, in the form of a dollar amount off their electricity bill, from the sale of the energy generated on their plot.
Members do not pay for maintenance of the array. Instead, a small portion of the money generated from the sale of solar energy goes toward upkeep of the solar garden.
The Haystack’s solar garden plots will be on sale until Sept. 30, with the team behind the project holding information sessions throughout September.
“It’s an exciting model to be pioneering for Australia that other countries have been enjoying for years,” said Haystacks Solar Garden Project Manager Kim Mallee. “With the [government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese] committing to fund 85 solar gardens around the country, we’ll see many more households given the chance to access solar.”

The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) releases an annual report on solar panel shipments, including imports and exports. This year’s report shows that in 2021, shipments of PV modules rose to a record capacity of 28.8 million peak kW in 2021, from 21.8 million peak kW in 2020.
The shipments represented an increase of 32%, despite module supply issues due to ongoing effect of the pandemic. This growth also occurred in the face of international trade issues, including the Hoshine Withhold Release Order (WRO), and antidumping and anti-circumvention tariff threats.
The United States added 13.2 GW of utility-scale solar capacity in 2021, an annual record and 25% more than the 10.6 GW added in 2020. Research from Princeton University and affiliates projects that these figures could reach 50 GW a year by 2024. By 2031, that number may reach as high as 100 GW of deployment per year.
Small-scale solar installations under 1 MW  increased by 5.4 GW in 2021, said the EIA. Residential installations surpassed 3.9 GW in 2021, from 2.9 GW in 2020.
The top five US states for solar panel shipments, representing 46% of the nation’s capacity:
In 2021, the United States recorded nearly 29 million module shipments. This number was only 320,000 when EIA began reporting it in 2006, and about 3.7 million in 2011.

The final average price came in at HUF 25.16 ($0.062)/kWh.
The total amount of contracted capacity was the highest level recorded in the history of the country's METAR-KÁT tendering scheme for large-scale renewables. However, the total number of applicants was below usual levels.
“The decline of the competition might be attributable to the tight deadline for submission and the new requirement set out in the tender, namely the obligation to undertake to provide 10% storage capacity with each project,” Kinga Máté, a Hungarian legal expert, told pv magazine.
For the small PVPP category – which includes installations between 300 kW and 1 MW – the final average price was HUF 25.49/ kWh. In the large PVPP group, with projects ranging in size from 1 MW to 20 MW, the final average price was HUF 24.96/ kWh.
“All 12 projects apply solar technology, half of them calculated to use a tracking system. It is interesting to observe that all six large projects are located in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county, the northeastern part of Hungary,” said Ferenc Kis, a Hungarian renewable energy analyst.
HEPURA expects to contract 864 GWh in total. It awarded feed-in premium payments, on top of wholesale electricity returns, for 15-year contracts.
Solar was particularly successful in Hungary's first three procurement exercises. In the third auction, HEPURA contracted 299 GW and allocated 183 MW of PV capacity. For the small PVPP category – for installations between 300 kW and 1 MW – the final average price was HUF 21.26/ kWh. In the large PVPP group, with projects ranging in size from 1 MW to 20 MW, the final average price was HUF 16.15/ kWh.
In the second auction, which was finalized in February, the lowest bid came in at HUF 16.18/kWh. For installations between 300 kW and 1 MW, the final prices ranged from HUF 21/kWh to HUF 23.03/kWh. For projects ranging in size from 1 MW to 49.9 MW, the final prices ranged from HUF 16.18/kWh to HUF 17.97/kWh. The average final prices in the first and second categories reached HUF 22.35 and HUF 17.22, respectively.
In the first pilot auction, held in March 2020, HEPURA awarded almost all the 131.9 MW capacity to solar projects. The final average price was HUF 24.81/kWh in the first category and HUF 21.69/kWh in the second. The lowest bid of HUF 20.20/kWh was submitted for a 20 MW solar plant.

“The new ferroelectric material – which is grown in the lab from cesium germanium tribromide (CsGeBr3 or CGB) – opens the door to an easier approach to making solar cell devices,” they said. “Unlike conventional solar materials, CGB crystals are inherently polarized, where one side of the crystal builds up positive charges and the other side builds up negative charges, no doping required.”
In “Ferroelectricity in a semiconducting all-inorganic halide perovskite,” recently published in Science Advances, the researchers said they used a perovskite known as CsGeX3. They described it as the only type of inorganic halide perovskites with a noncentrosymmetric crystal structure that could lead to potential ferroelectric properties.
“We attained the synthetic control for producing single-crystalline CsGeBr3 (CGB) nanowires and nanoplates by facile chemical vapor transport (CVT) methods,” the scientists said. “The CGB nanostructures have a bandgap of 2.38 eV, exhibiting strong visible light absorption and photoresponses.”
This lead-free solar material can harvest solar energy and has a spontaneously formed electric field, the academics noted.
“Most perovskite solar materials are not ferroelectric because their crystalline atomic structure is symmetrical, like a snowflake,” they said, adding that previous research had shown that embedding a germanium atom in a perovskite could theoretically distort its crystallinity just enough to engender ferroelectricity.
They grew tiny single-crystalline CGB-based nanowires with diameters of 100 nanometers to 1,000 nanometers. They also developed nanoplates that were around 200 nanometers to 600 nanometers thick and 10 microns wide, with exceptional control and precision. The group then analyzed the material through electron microscopy and found that CGB's light absorption properties are tunable.
“We anticipate that this study will open a pathway for further exploration into this class of semiconducting ferroelectric materials and trigger new possibilities in developing previously underexplored multifunctional materials such as photoferroelectrics,” they concluded.

Axpo has finished building a 2.2 MW PV system on the Muttsee Dam, at an altitude of almost 2,500 meters above sea level.
The Swiss energy company secured a power purchase agreement from supermarket chain Denner for the project in January. The deal was the first bilateral agreement for an unsubsidized solar project in Switzerland.
The CHF 8 million ($8.2 million) vertical installation features 5,000 solar modules and can produce around 3 million kWh of electricity per year. It can provide a higher electricity yield than conventional ground-mounted systems due to the high-altitude location.
IWB, a Basel-based energy company, also participated in the construction of the PV plant via its Paneco subsidiary. It owns a 49% stake in the project.

In “Nanomaterials for on-board solid-state hydrogen storage applications” – recently published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy – the scientists compared the advantages and challenges of physical-based and materials-based hydrogen storage techniques. They looked at compressed H2, liquid H2 or cold/cryo-compressed H2; metal hydrides, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), and chemical H2.
They concluded that physical-based hydrogen storage systems have already reached commercial maturity. Such methods have been used in onboard vehicular applications, but the scientists also acknowledged the challenge posed by are still unable to overcome the current constraints in hydrogen supply chains.
They noted, for example, that carbon composite fiber tanks are still too expensive. They also acknowledged that liquid hydrogen storage is still too costly, even though it enables a higher volumetric density.
“Liquid hydrogen also suffers from unavoidable evaporation, known as boil-off, due to the low enthalpy of evaporation of hydrogen and the difficulties in efficiently managing heat ingress throughout the supply chain,” they explained. “In addition, during the hydrogen liquefaction process, the reaction of converting orthohydrogen to parahydrogen releases heat of around 527 kJ/kg.”
The scientists said that only a few materials-based techniques seem close to a breakthrough.
“Among adsorbent-based hydrogen storage materials, catalyzed graphene-based materials and manganese hydride-based Kubas-type materials seem to be promising. These materials are able to absorb and desorb hydrogen at ambient temperature,” they said, noting that their gravimetric and volumetric density is still not competitive with current physical-based hydrogen storage systems.
The scientists also noted the strong potential of metal hydrides.
“Among metal hydride-based hydrogen storage materials, magnesium and magnesium-based hydrides have been considered as feasible materials to store hydrogen and have attracted huge attention during recent years,” they said. “This is mainly due to the great abundance of magnesium (Mg) in the Earth's crust as well as the high hydrogen gravimetric and volumetric density of magnesium hydride (MgH2).”
The study provides a quick analysis of the technology-readiness level (TRL) of hydrogen storage for onboard applications. The TRL measures the maturity of technology components for a system and is based on a scale from one to nine, with nine representing mature, commercialized technologies.
