Just months after passage of the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), power plant owner-operator AES Corporation and industrial gases company Air Products announced a $4 billion joint venture to build, own and operate a green hydrogen production facility in Texas with 1.4 GW of solar and wind capacity, that could qualify for the clean hydrogen production tax credit under section 45V of the IRA.
The project, to produce 200 metric tons of green hydrogen per day, is “financially viable” even without a grid connection, said the policy consultancy Energy Innovation in a report.
To identify other locations where green hydrogen production can be profitable, Energy Innovation modeled project economics and found that in areas with a “strong” wind resource and “decent” solar resource, these projects are “financially viable from the outset.”
The broader focus of the report is an argument for “smart design” of the section 45V production tax credit for clean hydrogen, to ensure that it fosters both low emissions and growth of the clean hydrogen industry.
The report discusses three types of clean hydrogen project designs that the authors suggest will qualify for the tax credit, by matching renewable generation on an hourly basis with the consumption of electricity by electrolyzers.
Electrolyzers use electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The US Treasury is currently developing regulations to specify the requirements to qualify for the section 45V tax credit.
The simplest project design discussed in the report would use only on-site renewable power, as shown at left in the nearby image. The report also describes “export-only” projects that could sell excess renewable power to the grid and, at times of high market power prices, turn off the electrolyzer plant and sell all the power to the grid. The third project configuration, “detached,” would use grid power and could match its hourly use of power to hourly accounting of the emissions rate from grid power.

For its financial analysis, Energy Innovation modeled export-only projects with “oversized” wind and solar capacity relative to the electrolyzer plant’s capacity. Oversizing the renewable generation can increase the electrolyzer plant’s utilization, as indicated in the nearby image. The image also shows sales of exported electricity both at times of excess generation and when market prices for power are at a “premium.”

“Wide swaths of the US” can support profitable green hydrogen production, the report says, where the cost of power from new wind and solar capacity averages less than $25/MWh, as shown on the nearby map.

Energy Innovation map of hydrogen production in the United States.
For the three locations shown with stars on the map, Energy Innovation modeled project finances for an export-only green hydrogen plant. Most profitable was the West Texas location, achieving profits of $143 per kW of electrolyzer capacity per year, by powering a 1 MW electrolyzer plant with 3 MW of solar and 2 MW of wind. Next most profitable was the location near Houston, with profits of $85 per kW/year using higher levels of both solar and wind capacity, followed by the southwest Minnesota location with profits of $61 per kW/year using 2 MW of solar and 4 MW of wind.
Energy Innovation assumed electrolyzer capital costs of $1,400 per kW. Revenues would include hydrogen revenue of $1/kg, plus the IRA’s production tax credit and electricity sales. The cost of water was not a factor in the analysis. In each location, about half the electricity generated would be sold to the grid. The need for an export-only hydrogen plant to interconnect to the power grid, the report says, is “a process which can incur high costs, delays, and overall uncertainty.”
As electrolyzer capital costs continue to decline, green hydrogen projects will become economic in more locations over time, the report says. When those costs decline to the point that electrolyzers need to run only 20% to 30% of the time to be profitable, “solar-only projects will become viable.” The report says “this is a desirable long-term outcome,” because electrolyzers that run only in “very low-priced hours can help integrate higher shares of renewable energy onto the grid.”
To enable the use of hydrogen for seasonal storage of renewable power, Mitsubishi Power Americas and Magnum Development LLC are adding 300 GWh of hydrogen storage capacity in salt domes near the Intermountain Power Project in Utah, which sells electricity to the Los Angeles municipal utility.
Current industrial uses of hydrogen include production of ammonia, largely for fertilizer, and oil refining. Ammonia could also be used as a fuel for shipping. The Green Hydrogen Coalition says that green hydrogen could also decarbonize the production of steel and cement.

However, there is a need for techno-economic models to allow the cost/performance of a complete system to be defined and optimized.
Now, researchers from the University of South Hampton and the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom have for the first time defined such a model and used it in the design of a 24V system for a charging hub in Sierra Leone.
A 1.64 kW 4 h duration system was found to be optimal, before diminishing returns began. The simulated efficiency of this system was 59%.
The researchers found that electrolyte for a 3.5 kW/14 kWh system would fit in a 1000 L IBC. Increasing the scale of the unit from ∼1.5 kW to ∼3.75 kW reduces the cost of the IBC from GBP 16/kWh to GBP 7/kWh, they calculated.
Methanesulfonic acid (MSA) was found to be the largest cost component of the 4 h system, with graphitic bipolar plates next. Both have low raw material costs, and in an optimistic scenario a total component cost of <£50/kWh would be achieved, half that of current NMC Li-ion cells.
Namely, the present cost of components (including stack frame manufacture) is estimated at GBP98/kWh to GBP 120/kWh (excluding control and assembly) assuming that a deposit thickness of 1 mm may be reliably achieved. However, according to the researchers, both MSA and bipolar plates have the potential for future price decreases as more efficient manufacturing techniques have recently been introduced.
Therefore, the researchers calculate that with reductions in MSA and bipolar plate costs, this range could fall as low as £43-£56/kWh, making the SLFB cheaper at the DC level than NMC Li-ion cells.
The greatest risk to the system cost is an inability to reliably deposit lead and lead oxide at the assumed thickness of 1 mm, with thinner deposits increasing component cost and reducing efficiency.
“As testing of deposits of this thickness has not been performed across many cycles, there is an important gap in the knowledge of the SLFB which future research must address,” the researchers wrote in “Predicting the cost of a 24V soluble lead flow battery optimized for PV applications,” which was recently published in the Journal of Power Sources.

According to Shiva Gorjian, the corresponding author of the research, “while CPV systems may be initially more expensive than conventional PV systems, their higher efficiency and potential benefits to crop yield and land use make them a promising technology for use in agrivoltaics.”
Gorjian added that by using CPV systems, less land is required to generate the same amount of electricity as a conventional PV system, which can make agrivoltaic installations have less impact on agriculture and take up less land.
The research team's paper, “Technological advancements and research prospects of innovative concentrating agrivoltaics,” published in Applied Energy, outlined several CPV system configurations for use in agrivoltaics, which have been previously analyzed or implemented.
The research highlighted the advantages of using CPV systems, such as the ability to create microclimates that benefit certain crops and the potential to be used in urban environments for cultivating plants and vegetables.
The researchers emphasized the use of tracking modules in CPV systems that ensure that the shadow of the plant moves and does not remain in the same area. They also explained that the optical mechanism of the CPV system can better solve the problem of light splitting compared to conventional agrivoltaics.
The research group included academics from Iran's Bu-Ali Sina University, the University of Manitoba in Canada, the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and Mälardalen University (MDH) in Sweden.

For a decade, rural electrification focused mainly on providing access to lighting and basic entertainment services through solar home systems (SHS) and minigrids, which are essential but do not provide economic empowerment.
PUE solutions come in various forms, but their main purpose is to provide the user with more cash in hand. PUE can lead to reduced costs, increased revenues, or both. The fishing industry is an excellent example, where solar freezers reduce fish loss and increase the quality of the fish, resulting in a better price for the fishermen.
PUE solutions can be applied to many sectors, such as agriculture, commercial and small industrial activities, public infrastructure, and health services. They can also be applied to various situations, including off-grid locations, minigrids, and grid-connected locations. At AFSIA, we focus exclusively on solar-based PUE solutions.
Our most popular solutions include solar irrigation and solar cooling. Solar irrigation offers a fantastic business case for the end user, as it allows year-round cultivation, increases the yield per acre significantly, and reduces total cost of ownership up to 90% compared to diesel-powered irrigation. Solar cooling, comprising fridges, freezers, and cold rooms, reduces post-harvest loss, increases bargaining power for farmers, and is the ideal companion for solar irrigation.
AFSIA will unveil its first “PUE Catalog” in an online event on May 4, which aims to identify all available solar-based PUE solutions, list the companies distributing these solutions, and share business case specifics for each solution. This catalog will help more solar stakeholders become aware of the potential of PUE to unlock economic activity and improve livelihoods in Africa.
AFSIA will hold a webinar on PUEs on May 4, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. (CET). Register at: https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/4516820637960/WN_k63FqgQUREuFhydPiZIrlQ

This is the highest figure ever recorded by Pexapark in a single month, and represents a 14% increase compared to February. Although March had seven fewer deals than February, the number of deals is still higher than any other month in 2022.
In the first quarter of 2023, developers announced almost 70 PPAs for a total of 6 GW.

According to Pexapark, the Pexa Euro Composite saw a 0.5% increase in prices compared to the previous month. Spain and Portugal maintained their position with the lowest prices in Europe. Meanwhile, the Polish index recorded the largest increase, surging by 28.9% compared to the previous month. In contrast, the Nordic countries experienced the steepest decline with a 11.5% drop month on month.
Energy reform
On March 14, the European Commission finally published its proposal to reform the design of the EU electricity market. The report authors of Pexapark, a Swiss consultancy, expressed their excitement after analyzing how some of the proposed reforms will impact the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) market on the continent. However, the authors noted that the final legislation is not expected before 2025. Nonetheless, the authors believe that the European Commission's new electricity market design reform proposal has the potential to usher in the Golden Age of PPAs.
Currently, between 100 and 150 transactions take place annually, generating between 10 and 20 GW of new capacity. Pexapark projects that the measures included in the reform could generate over 1,000 TWh of corporate demand. This corporate demand will increase in parallel with GDP and general electrification efforts, resulting in hundreds of additional PPAs to support new renewable capacity.
Pexapark emphasizes that Europe's conversion into a “much larger and more vibrant” PPA market is underpinned by measures that allow for new and increased investment in renewable capacity. Additionally, the proposed credit support mechanisms will unlock the demand for PPAs. “Based on our experience, credit has become a key obstacle to holding more PPAs,” the authors explain. The Commission proposes that projects that have already committed part of their generation to a PPA allocate another part of the production to buyers who have difficulties accessing the PPA market, such as small and medium-sized companies.

Luma Energy, the company responsible for power transmission in Puerto Rico, announced that it has supported more than 54,000 customer connections to rooftop solar in 21 months, representing 330 MW added to the grid.
As a result of this progress, Puerto Rico now ranks seventh among all US states and territories in residential solar energy adoption per capita, according to net metering data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). 
Luma fully supports the growth of clean renewable energy; in fact, in a range of activities from connecting customers to rooftop solar, to interconnecting utility-scale renewable plants, to rebuilding and modernizing the electric grid, the over 3,000 men and women of Luma are accelerating the clean energy transformation for Puerto Ricans. Looking ahead, we are committed to working together with our customers, our regulator, elected leaders and other partners to establish Puerto Rico as a sustainable, clean energy leader for generations to come, said Wayne Stensby, president and CEO of Luma  
Luma Energy became the operator in Puerto Rico in 2021, replacing the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) in that role. The company launched an accelerated solar connection program that the company says provides customers with shorter wait times for approval. The program has increased customer connections to an average of 3,400 each month, Luma reports. In the 21 months since Luma assumed operations of the electric system, the company says that the number of interconnected residential solar customers has tripled compared to what was achieved in the previous decade, growing from approximately 24,000 to over 78,000 total solar connections.
“Luma has streamlined the net metering process, shortening average wait times to under 30 days. Luma’s centralized approach and collaboration with the solar and storage industry have driven steady growth in solar installations, ensuring energy resilience and savings for tens of thousands of Puerto Rican families. We look forward to our continued collaboration and expanding the adoption of renewable energy across the island,” said P.J. Wilson, executive director of the Solar and Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico (SESA). 
In addition to advancing more home solar connections for customers, Luma reports it is working toward more than 1.3 GW of utility-scale renewable generation to Puerto Rico’s electric grid.

The E2 Solar Project, built on 226 hectares of reclaimed land off the coast of Taixi in southern Taiwan, was constructed in two stages, with the first 134 MW phase of the project commissioned in March 2022. The entire project features approximately 680,000 solar panels with an installed capacity of 272 MW, capable of generating about 400 GWh of clean energy annually which Vena said is up to 4% of Taiwan’s total solar energy output, establishing it as a major contributor to the nation’s transition to green energy.
Vena Energy Chief Executive Officer Nitin Apte said the E2 Solar Project is the company’s largest operating project to date and forms a key part of its plans to accelerate the energy transition across the Asia-Pacific.
“All of the 35 GW of solar, onshore wind, offshore wind, battery storage and hybrid renewable energy projects operating or in development across the Asia-Pacific region are key to achieving a net-zero carbon emissions target by 2050,” he said. “Since 2015, we have successfully commissioned and operated seven solar photovoltaic projects totalling 412 MW, and we are delighted to see Taiwan steadily moving towards the transformation of its energy sector.”
Vena also has its focus fixed on the Australian energy market with the company indicating it has some 6 GW of renewable energy projects planned here.
The company, owned by US-based investment fund Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), already operates the 97 MW Tailem Bend Solar Farm in South Australia, and is currently constructing the 85 MW second stage, with a 41.5 MW one-hour battery energy storage system being built at the site.
It recently completed the 100 MW/150 MWh Wandoan South battery in Queensland and has indicated that is just the first phase in the larger Wandoan South Project, which could eventually feature 650 MW of solar and 450 MW of energy storage capacity.

The capacity additions represent a cumulative investment opportunity of more than €70 billion between 2023 and 2050. More than 40% of this capital will be deployed by the end of 2030.
Batteries with more than four hours of storage capacity will account for 61% of total installed battery capacity in 2050, up from 22% in 2025, said Aurora Energy Research in its latest report. It identifies Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, and Italy as Europe’s most attractive markets, due to policies, regulatory support, revenue stacking opportunities, and demand for low-carbon flexible energy.
Greece, for example, has set the most ambitious battery storage targets in Europe, at 6 GW by 2030. It is followed by Italy's 3 GW by 2030 target, whereas Great Britain and Ireland offer good revenue stacking opportunities.
However, the report states that there is still scope for further growth of Europe's big battery fleet. Aurora Energy Research notes that 14 of the 24 countries it assessed do not yet have strategies or targets for energy storage deployment. One of these countries is Germany, but the sheer scope of its rapidly growing renewables capacity make it an attractive storage market.
“Batteries represent an attractive investment opportunity in Europe’s energy sector,” says Ryan Alexander, Aurora Energy Research's European power markets research lead. “There will undoubtedly be an early mover advantage for investors: the anticipated surge in demand for batteries over the next decades creates saturation risk, causing revenues to decline as markets become overcrowded.”
In a separate report last week, research firm LCP Delta said that 4.5 GW of battery energy storage capacity was installed in 2022, including 1.9 GW of grid-scale battery projects. LCP Delta says that 3.7 GW of big batteries are set to go online in 2023, mainly driven by growing demand for flexibility in power systems with growing renewable energy fleets.
The publication of the reports coincide with a statement from European Commission’s commissioner for energy, Kadri Simson, highlighting the importance of storage for Europe’s decarbonization efforts.
The latest issue of pv magazine takes a look at how the long-established link between solar and cannabis cultivation can help improve margins as medicinal and recreational use of the drug comes out of the weeds. We take a trip Down Under to examine why communities are rebelling against planned renewable energy zones perceived as being railroaded through without sufficient local consultation, and we consider the “solar crime” wave sweeping the UK and Europe.
“We have a lot of topics on our agenda. But storage is the centerpiece for building a decarbonized, flexible and cost-effective energy system, through electrification and energy system integration,” Simson said last week. “the fact is that the role of storage is often overlooked.”
Several high-level measures are under development at this point to help kick-start the energy storage market in Europe, including revisions of the Electricity Market Design, a European Commission recommendation on energy storage for member states, and a storage-friendly network code.

“Heat-pump technology is a European success story that we want to continue,” said Christian Fischer, Bosch’s deputy chairman.
The manufacturer has been investing heavily in European heat-pump development since 2018, due to rising demand. Construction work is scheduled to start in 2024, with the start of production scheduled for late 2025 or early 2026. The plant will create 500 new jobs by 2027, according to Bosch.
The German heating manufacturer will also start producing air-source heat pumps with R290 refrigerant at its site in Eibelshausen, Germany – the company’s original manufacturing facility. It also develops and makes heat pumps in Portugal, Sweden, and Wernau, Germany.
Bosch says its heat pump sales grew by 54% in 2022.
“In the European Union, we expect growth in this very dynamic environment to be exceptionally high and have set ourselves the target of growing significantly faster than the market,” said Jan Brockmann, the CEO of Bosch Home Comfort Group. “Together with our existing plants in Europe, the new plant in Poland will help us achieve these growth targets.”
