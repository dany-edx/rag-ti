Meanwhile, PV manufacturing continues to be split into two camps regarding wafer size, with products based on both 182mm and 210mm formats beginning to be produced at scale, and proponents of both claiming an advantage in performance.
Chinese manufacture JinkoSolar launched its Tiger Neo modules earlier this year, relying on n-type TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivated contact) technology. And the company is firmly in the 182mm camp with regard to wafer format, believing the smaller of the two formats to be both easier to transport and to incorporate into PV system design.
A new white paper compares Jinko’s 605 W n-type module with a 660 W p-type product based on the 210mm wafer, from an unnamed manufacturer. In the paper, Jinko takes us through project cost calculations for three different locations, finding significant advantage for its own products in each. In the first, a 200 MW project located in Inner Mongolia, Jinko finds that the smaller size of its modules allows for more modules, and more watts, to be installed on a single tracker – resulting in lower cost for balance of systems components.
Combined with the higher efficiency and better temperature coefficient of the n-type technology, Jinko estimated that the project would achieve a levelized cost of electricity 6% lower, and a return on investment 5.31% higher for its modules over the 210mm product. The study reached similar conclusions for projects located in Saudi Arabia and Spain.
For the two projects outside of China, Jinko noted that the currently high shipping prices are another advantage for its smaller module. “It is worth noting that Tiger Neo (either 72 or 78 cells) is superior to the 210 module when sea freight costs are high,” the company stated. “On the same shipping route, the total loading power of the 210P module packing scheme is less than that of the 182N, making the cost per watt of the 210P module less competitive.”
In the analysis for both projects, Jinko calculated a shipping cost of US$7189/container to Saudi Arabia and $6000/container to Spain. And the company further notes that costs for additional support equipment and labor required in transportation of the heavier 210mm modules – so the gap could in fact be even higher.
Manufacturers working with the 210mm cell format have also made calculations and carried out case studies demonstrating an advantage for their products in the field as well. PV Infolink and other analysts forecast a larger share for 182mm products initially, with the 210mm format gaining ground later in this decade as initial challenges integrating into production lines and systems are overcome. Of course, this could all change again – with wafer manufacturer Zhonghuan having announced the introduction of an even large, 218.2mm wafer earlier today.
On the cell technology side, things are slightly clearer, although PERC will likely continue to represent the biggest share of PV for the next years, the interest in TOPCon from large players is a sign of things to come.

It is expected to be located near the borough of San Gregorio, in the Magallanes region, Southern Chile. “The H2 Magallanes installed capacity coupled with up to 8 GW of electrolysis capacity, a desalination plant, an ammonia (NH3) plant, and port facilities to transport the green ammonia to national and international markets. The objective is to conduct studies in order to launch the project in 2025, aiming to produce hydrogen by 2027,” Total Eren wrote on Thursday. Chile wants to reach 25 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030
Spanish energy company Acciona Energía and U.S.-based hydrogen fuel cell system developer Plug Power have announced the formation of the 50/50 joint venture they announced back in February. The new Madrid-based company, AccionaPlug, will develop, operate, and maintain green hydrogen projects in Spain and Portugal. According to the February announcement, the investment in the new company would be about €2 billion. AccionaPlug, which will develop hydrogen production facilities directly for its industrial customers and stand-alone production plants for regional distribution, expects its first facilities to be operational in 2023.
Swedish startup H2 Green Steel (H2GS) and Spanish energy giant Iberdrola announced a partnership to build a power plant with an electrolysis capacity of 1 GW to produce green hydrogen. It will power a direct reduction ore (DRI) tower to produce at least 2 million tons per year of “green” steel and iron. The site will be located on the Iberian Peninsula, where several possible locations are currently being considered. The companies expect to start production in 2025 or 2026. “The companies will explore the opportunity to site a green steel production facility capable of producing between 2.5 and 5 million tons of green flat steel per year in conjunction with the plant,” H2GS said in a statement.
Steel production could be made with almost no carbon emissions through US$278 billion of extra investment by 2050, according to a new report from BloombergNEF (BNEF). Hydrogen and recycling are the two pillars of the decarbonization process for steel production. Steel, responsible for around 7% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions, should be recycled, writes BNEF, especially in China. “By 2050, green hydrogen could be the cheapest production method for steel and capture 31% of the market. Another 45% could come from recycled material,” reads the press release, which also explains that efforts to decarbonize steel production are central to the net-zero aspirations of China, Japan, Korea, and the European Union.
Italian gas grid operator Snam has entered into an agreement with Italy’s oil and gas major Eni to buy a 49.9% stake in companies operating two groups of international gas pipelines connecting Algeria to Italy. The €385-million transaction includes the onshore gas pipelines running from the Algerian and Tunisian borders to the Tunisian coast (TTPC), and the offshore gas pipelines connecting the Tunisian coast to Italy. Snam, which is also buying stakes in the Eastern Mediterranean, sees the hydrogen potential of the Mediterranean. “Through this transaction, Snam is bridging its infrastructure towards North Africa, which represents a key area for gas supplies to Italy and forward-looking for hydrogen development. In the future, North Africa could also become a hub for producing solar energy and green hydrogen,” Marco Alverà, Snam CEO commented. Snam expects to complete the transaction by the third quarter of 2022. This week, the company presented its vision to 2030. It expects €23 billion worth of investments, the majority – €12 billion – being investments in the existing H2-ready network.
India's engineering conglomerate Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and renewable energy company ReNew Power have announced a partnership agreement to develop green hydrogen projects in India. Under the agreement, L&T and ReNew will jointly develop, own, execute, and operate green hydrogen projects in India. “I expect this partnership to set new benchmarks in the Indian renewable energy space and look forward to working together with L&T,” ReNew's Chairman & CEO Sumant Sinha commented. ReNew Power has a portfolio of more than 5,600 MW located in eight states of India, with most of its wind capacity in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, and most of its solar capacity in Karnataka and Telangana. Goldman Sachs and CPP Investments are among ReNew Power's owners.
Representatives from over 19 countries participated in the launch of H2LAC, a new platform to promote the development of green hydrogen in Latin America and the Caribbean. “This initiative is endorsed by GIZ in collaboration with the World Bank, ECLAC, and the European Union’s Euroclima+ Program. There are currently 13 countries participating through projects that are implemented by GIZ’s national offices in the region,” reads a press release published on Tuesday. According to the Chilean ministry, the countries in the region “could all have a perfect regional strategy and position themselves as a cluster to export green molecules to the large consumption centers, for example in the United States, Europe, or Asia.”

Engineering firm Schlaich Bergermann Partner (sbp sonne) has had a 50kW prototype of its floating photovoltaic system in the water in Hungary since mid-October. The system does not consist of small plastic floats that are connected to each other; instead, it is comprised of 40-meter-long and 80-centimeter-thick membrane tubes that are only inflated during installation on site. This offers a whole range of advantages over other systems, according to sbp's engineers.
In the design, two tubes are inflated parallel to each other. A steel frame with a width of 4.5 meters is attached between them, to which the modules are fitted. Over the length of the tube, 24 PV modules can be added. Unlike the prototype, where only four pairs of tubes were installed, 25 pairs of tubes are to be connected to form an island.
Two such islands next to each other will then form a block of one-megawatt power, with the power electronics on board. The dimensions of a one-megawatt block would be 80 meters in length and up to 108 meters in width. On one half of such a block, 2,708 square meters of module area would come to 4,320 square meters of gross area. This corresponds to a space utilization factor of around 63%.

In an interview with pv magazine, Markus Balz, managing director of the sbp Sonne office said that they have designed the first floating system optimized for bifacial PV modules. This is because a light-colored membrane layer with an albedo value of over 0.6 is stretched underneath the steel frame, meaning that 60% of the light is reflected by the membrane.
For comparison, 0.8 is roughly equivalent to the albedo value of freshly fallen snow. Water surfaces usually have an albedo value of 0.1 and are therefore not really suitable for the use of bifacial modules. To ensure that the membrane also receives enough direct sunlight, sbp Sonne chose the spacing between the modules at an optimal ratio of 50 millimeters. “We had to give the modules some spacing so they wouldn't collide with each other in bad weather,” Balz explained. “That's when we optimized the spacing between the modules right away for use with bifacial modules.”
Transport can also be improved with the inflatable system. Logistics are quite expensive with floats made of blow-molded plastic, as they take up a lot of space. The inflatable tubes, on the other hand, can be folded up. This allows floating photovoltaic construction material to be transported in a shipping container for three times the capacity of a conventional system. The tubes are also said to offer better protection from waves and wind. Because of the elongated shape, the tubes can partially conform to the shape of the waves, compensating for some of the movement. In addition, this hull shape provides less surface area to attack than small-scale rectangular systems, so anchors and mooring can be sized somewhat smaller.
If the waters were calm, only a few millibars would be pumped into the tubes. Since these are very large, they would still appear hard to humans. When the forces of nature become much more noticeable and the wind picks up, the tubes can be inflated to higher pressures via integrated pumps. The increased pressure, however, results in a very high rigidity of the system, he said. “Similar to a single-axis tracker, we also want to increase the stiffness of the floating system when the wind loads become greater,” Balz continued. By making the pressure in the tubes adaptive, the material can be spared from premature wear, when the weather does not demand particularly high stiffness.
A weather station on board the system monitors wind speed and wave action and can thus autonomously decide whether to inflate the tubes. Since the system inflates itself in case of danger and the prototype was built near the membrane manufacturer's site in Hungary, sbp Sonne named its system “Gömbhal” – Hungarian for pufferfish.
Should air ever escape from one of the tubes, they would initially be protected by an adjacent parallel tube. Should all the air escape from a double tube, the system would still be buoyant, Balz said. At the 50-kilowatt pilot plant in Hungary, air has already been let out of one of the tubes to exchange it while the plant was floating on the water. The test worked flawlessly, he said.
Over the next year, the engineers plan to collect data. To do that, all sorts of sensors have been attached to the system. This is to determine whether the assumptions about the increased bifaciality also correspond to real-world conditions. The engineers at sbp are already confident about the static properties of the system and say that nothing stands in the way of commercial sales of these systems. According to Balz, the company is already in talks with the first project developers and EPC companies but is also open to other interested parties.

Switzerland-based heterojunction PV module manufacturer Meyer Burger announced it will reduce production output in Germany. This decision is due to the sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 infections in Germany and an “above-average employee sickness absence.”
Production will be slowed down at the PV module production in Freiberg, Saxony. It is expected that only one of the two production lines will be operated at the facility by the end of January 2022.
The reduced output will only have a minor, short-term impact on a small number of confirmed orders, Meyer Burger said. This is also due to the “conservative planning of deliveries to customers,” the company added, noting that incoming orders continue to develop positively.
“However, customers have to be prepared for higher prices for heterojunction solar modules,” it continued. “Due to the general development of costs and in line with competitors, Meyer Burger has increased prices from next year and informed customers accordingly.”
Regardless of the adverse effects of the corona pandemic, the ramp-up of Meyer Burger's production is moving forward according to schedule. However, the production capacity in Freiberg is temporarily limited due to the work required for the planned expansion to 1 GW, Meyer Burger stated. This will have a negative impact on this year's sales.
Meyer Burger's outlook for 2023 remains unchanged. The announced capacity expansion at the Freiberg and Thalheim locations, as well as the expansion of production in the U.S., will not be affected by the corona pandemic.
The company concluded on an upbeat note, saying the development of the photovoltaic market in the coming year is expected to be “very positive,” while demand for high-performance modules “remains excellent”.

Through a first procurement exercise, the SEA wants to award a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) for a 5 MW solar power plant located on building rooftops and car park areas of the Ministry of Education. The required works include the installation of EV charging stations.
Through a second tender, the SEA intends to award a 20-year PPA for a project with the same features and a capacity of 2.5 MW at the Ministry of Labour & Social Development.
Both facilities should be deployed on a Build Own Operate and Maintain (BOOM) basis and for both exercises, the deadline to submit project proposals is December 22.
Bahrain wants to bring 255 MW of solar generation capacity online by 2025 by using net metering, tenders for large-scale projects, and a renewable energy mandate for new buildings. The kingdom’s renewable energy target envisages 700 MW of solar, wind, and energy-from-waste generation capacity by 2030.
Buildings are key to our daily lives and significantly impact our health and wellbeing. The majority also have substantial carbon footprints, employing heavy use of fossil fuels across their lifetimes, from their construction, use, and demolition phases. In addition to the predicted billions of square meters that will be added in the next decade, most of those buildings standing today will still be around in 2050. Thus, retrofitting existing structures is considered a key sustainability target.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/03/2021-and-beyond-european-solar-manufacturing-must-shine-again/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,EUROPE",,"DECEMBER 3, 2021",2021 and beyond: European solar manufacturing must shine again,"Europe has a clear strategic interest in supporting the redevelopment of solar PV manufacturing on the continent – it goes hand in hand with the further expansion of renewables in Europe.
The 2021 semiconductor crisis, and the consequences of undue pressure on the supply chains of our automotive and inverter industries, have taught us one thing: an industry can only develop sustainably with a clear strategic vision for its value chain. The European solar PV market is on an exponential growth curve, set to establish solar as the key energy producer in the next decade. Maintaining that growth will require redeveloping sizeable European manufacturing capacity for innovative technologies, and diversifying supply chains for our developers.
SolarPower Europe envisions 20 GW of production in Europe by 2025 along the solar PV value chain, from polysilicon to modules, moving in coordination with the component and equipment industry, and adapting to the needs of our project developers. This is the objective we set for the European Solar Initiative, an industrial alliance we launched in February this year, which facilitates the redevelopment of industrial projects in Europe. Currently in the EU, each of the ingot/wafer and cell segments have capacities of 1 GW or less. There are several sub-GW module manufacturers with a combined capacity of around 6-7 GW, but just one silicon and a few inverter manufacturers can produce GW-level output. Against these conditions, we have set an ambitious target, but the reality remains: it is only with GW-scale fabs that Europe can reach global cost competitiveness.
2021 has seen challenges for the solar PV industry, but despite this, several solar cell and module manufacturers have made significant steps forward. Meyer Burger opened two production sites in Eastern Germany with an annual 0.4 GW production capacity of solar cells and modules and secured financing to already achieve 1.4 GW and 1 GW production next year, for cells and modules respectively. Meanwhile, Oxford PV completed the build-out of its Brandenburg site and expects the line to start full production in 2022. NexWafe has received a strategic investment from global solar investor, Reliance, allowing it to start production in Germany in 2022, with plans to scale up to 3 GW as early as 2025.

It is particularly interesting to see an investment wave flooding the earlier stages of the value chain, showing the initial signs of market coordinated movement across the industry. Norwegian Crystal has announced plans to redevelop 10 GW of ingot production in Europe, while NorSun has doubled its ingot and wafer production capacity to 1 GW in 2021. We are also seeing that the solar glass and encapsulant industries are mobilizing to ensure that the solar reindustrialization of Europe is a full value chain effort.
With significant industrial developments across the value chain, it is no surprise that policymakers are increasingly acknowledging the potential of European solar manufacturing. The European Commission’s revised Industrial Strategy, published in May, identifies solar PV as one of the 14 key industrial ecosystems for the EU and recognizes the significant role of the European Solar Initiative. In the latter half of 2021, the publication of the Commission’s report on “Progress on competitiveness of clean energy technologies” notes that the industry is “growing with unexpected speed”, and recognizes the EU’s global leadership in various parts of the value chain, including R&D, polysilicon production, and equipment for PV manufacturing.
Recognition at the policy level has translated into strong financial advantages for European manufacturing, with several key announcements in 2021. In Italy, Enel Green Power is one of the first seven large-scale projects to be awarded under the EU’s first Innovation Fund. The award will fund a 3 GW scale-up of Enel’s bifacial heterojunction factory in Catania. A perfect showcase of the research and development value-add in Europe, the innovative technology offers higher performance with respect to conventional PV modules.
Without financing support to de-risk reinvestment into strategic manufacturing capacities, the industry will struggle to maximize its potential and deliver the continent’s climate goals. The recent renewal of the InvestEU program is the perfect opportunity to make the European Investment Bank the industrial investment arm of the EU Industrial Strategy.
Beyond financing, we also need to ensure a level-playing field for our manufacturers, compared to their global competitors. Manufacturers need access to globally competitive business environments, such as cost-competitive electricity or facilitated access to land. The sustainability of solar products must be better valued, without threatening the competitiveness of solar products and maintaining a healthy price competition.
With these conditions in place and with a united European industry, we can bring EU solar manufacturing to the next level. Looking into next year, the opportunity continues with the Commission’s landmark announcement of an EU Solar Strategy. Expected in Q2 2022, SolarPower Europe will work with our members and stakeholders to ensure this next communication will support the massive potential of the European solar manufacturing industry across the value chain.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/03/inverted-perovskite-solar-cell-with-23-7-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 3, 2021",Inverted perovskite solar cell with 23.7% efficiency,"A group of researchers from the Technische Universität Dresden in Germany and the University of Pavia in Italy has developed a perovskite solar cell with an inverted configuration (p–i–n) boasting a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 23.7%.
Traditionally, inverted perovskite cells have lower efficiencies compared with solar cells featuring a conventional configuration (n-i-p), due to weaker current extraction and nonradiative recombination losses that limit the device photovoltage and fill factor.
The Italian-German group claim to have overcome these issues by modifying the hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite and perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) interfaces by introducing a series of large organic cations such as 2-phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI), 4-chloro-phenylethylammonium iodide (Cl-PEAI), and 4-fluoro-phenylethylammonium iodide (F-PEAI), in very low concentration.
An antisolvent was dispensed onto the perovskite solution shortly before the end of the spin-coating step to improve the crystallization process of the perovskite layer.
“We find that this approach does not change the bulk perovskite crystal structure or its dimensionality but rather improves the interfaces by facilitating high-quality film formation on top of the HTL and inducing efficient defect passivation at the perovskite/ETL interface,” the academics said. “We show that the modification of the buried bottom interface leads to a more homogeneous film formation and the elimination of nanovoids at the perovskite/HTL interface.”
Four different solar cells were fabricated by the scientists: a reference cell; a cell with a modified HTL; a device with a modified ETL; and a dual HTL+ETL–modified cell. The dual-modified devices based on F-PEAI were found to combine the improvements observed at each interface and achieved the highest efficiency of 23.7%. This cell also showed a short-circuit current of 1.184 V and a high fill factor of 85%.
“Devices fabricated using F-PEAI cations consistently outperformed those made using the other derivatives,” the researchers emphasized. “We believe that this is associated with the fact that a larger quantity of F-PEAI remains at both the HTL and ETL interfaces.”We
propose that this is associated with differences in the solubility of the PEAI cations.”
The solar cell was presented in the study 23.7% Efficient inverted perovskite solar cells by dual interfacial modification, which was recently published in ScienceAdvances.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/03/narrowing-down-a-million-molecules-for-the-optimal-flow-battery/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"DECEMBER 3, 2021",Narrowing down a million molecules for the optimal flow battery,"Flow batteries based on vanadium, zinc-bromine and a few other materials are already proving their worth in energy infrastructure projects around the world.
There is, however, a long list of materials with the potential to lead to the design of flow batteries with lower cost, better performance, longer lifetimes and more. And the same can be said of other technologies in energy storage, and in other fields entirely. In all of these cases, narrowing down the list of possible materials, and finding those with the optimal set of characteristics for a particular application, can be an extremely time-consuming process.
Fortunately, scientists today can turn to software solutions to generate data about the characteristics of long lists of materials, and artificial intelligence to narrow down the list to materials with the characteristics they are looking for. And this was the approach taken by a group of researchers at Argonne National Laboratory in the United States in their search for new materials to test in flow battery designs. “In these batteries, we know that a majority of the molecules that we need will have to satisfy multiple properties,” said Argonne chemist Rajeev Assary. “By optimizing several properties simultaneously, we have a better shot of finding the best possible chemistry for our battery.”
The group identified three properties – reduction potential, solvation free energy, and fluorescence, and began their search for molecules with the best balance of all three. To speed up the search, they turned to an artificial intelligence technique known as active learning, in which an algorithm can train itself and improve its targeting of the desired characteristics as it goes. ““We’re essentially looking for needles in haystacks,” said Argonne researcher Hieu Doan. “When our model finds something that looks like a needle, it teaches itself how to find more.”
The model developed by the group is described in the paper Discovery of Energy Storage Molecular Materials Using Quantum Chemistry-Guided Multiobjective Bayesian Optimization, published in Chemistry of Materials. They began with a dataset of 1400 materials whose properties they had already analyzed, to train and test the algorithm. They then applied it to a list of 1 million molecules, and from this were able to identify 16 new molecules with more attractive properties than anything on their initial list of 1400. The group calculates that its algorithm is at least 15 times more efficient compared to a brute force or random selection approach.
And beyond flow batteries, the group notes that its model could be readily applied to other energy storage technologies, and even in completely different fields. “The mathematical approach we’re using is also widely used by stock traders and data scientists, which goes to show how common optimization problems are,” said Assary.

Structural batteries are materials with electrochemical energy storage properties that can be embedded in the structure of an object such as an electric vehicle or a drone. They are essentially aimed at reducing the weight of the object itself.
The scientists said that research and development on “massless” batteries started in 2007. They said that since then the main challenge has been to build devices with good electrical and mechanical properties. However, they claim that their carbon fiber-based battery has good storage properties, as well as the required stiffness and strength to be integrated into the structure of electric vehicles.
“Our battery may also be applied to the roof of city vehicles like rickshaws and similar vehicles which are also covered with solar cells,” researcher Leif Asp told pv magazine.
The battery consists of a carbon fiber (CF) negative electrode and an aluminum film-supported positive electrode separated by a glass fiber (GF) separator in a structural battery electrolyte (SBE) matrix material.
“The CFs act as host for Li, conduct electrons, and reinforce the material,” the researchers explained. “Similarly, the positive electrode foil provides combined mechanical and electrical functionality.”
They also noted that the SBE favors Li-ion transport and transfers mechanical loads between the device's fibers, particles, and plies. The demonstrated battery showed an elastic modulus of 25 gigapascals and tensile strength exceeding 300 megapascals. Elastic modulus measures the resistance of the material to elastic deformation and tensile strength refers to the maximum load that a material can support without fracturing when stretched.
“The battery has an energy density of 24 Wh/kg, meaning approximately 20 percent capacity compared to comparable lithium-ion batteries currently available,” the Swedish group said. “But since the weight of the vehicles can be greatly reduced, less energy will be required to drive an electric car, for example, and lower energy density also results in increased safety.”
They described the battery in “A Structural Battery and its Multifunctional Performance,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy & Sustainability Research. “We will now test the battery in combination with vehicle-integrated PV and aerospace vehicles,” Asp said.
In May, other scientists at Chalmers University of Technology unveiled a prototype of a rechargeable battery based on cement with an average energy density of 7 Wh/m2.
“This technology is perfectly suitable for large-scale storage of wind and solar energy,” researcher Luping Tan told pv magazine at the time. “It is also perfect for rooftop PV and our primary idea was to produce roof elements with battery functions for storage of energy from PV.”

“The system was manufactured using 3D print technology and consists of a single structure,” research author, Abdurrahman Yavuzdeger, told pv magazine.”Its rotation movement produces air streams that are able to reduce the operating temperature of the solar panels and reduces dust accumulation considerably.”
The system has a decagonal shape and each of its sides hosts a polycrystalline photovoltaic panel with a size of 140×60×2.5 mm and a weight of just 33g. The modules are placed at a 30mm distance from one another and they have a power conversion efficiency of over 17%. Their rated voltage is 6V and the rated current is 100mA.
Air ducts measuring 95×150 mm are embedded between each of the system's 10 sides to reduce the operating temperatures of the panels and, simultaneously, that of the whole system. A slip ring with an efficiency of around 96% has been used to solve the problem of entanglement of the cables in the solar modules.
A stepper motor Nema 23 for low-speed applications is used to rotate the system. It measures 56.4×56.4×76 mm and weighs in at 1kg. Its operating voltage is 8.6 V and its operating current is 1 A on each phase. A stepper motor driver TB6600 is used for rotation speed adjustment and the speed is controlled by a controller interface. The system's rotating speed ranges from 0 to 100 revolutions per minute (rpm). A measurement station records ambient temperature and solar radiation data.
The system was operated 0, 10, 50, and 100 rpm/h and with solar radiation of between 110 and 1210 W/m2. “Although the highest irradiance value is at 10 rpm, the highest power value produced from the RES has been measured at 100 rpm,” the scientists said. “The cooling of the PV panels has been realized with the increase of the rotation speed.”
The highest output power of the system was found to be 1.8067 W at operating 100 rpm and 756 W/m2 solar radiation, while the lowest was 0.5698 W at operating 10 rpm and 234 W/m2 solar radiation.
“The total cost of the system is approximately 3500 TL ($288.6),” Yavuzdeger told pv magazine. “But these costs date back to 2018 when we began assembly the prototype.” Looking forward, the Turkish group said it wants to improve the system design and apply MPPT converter topologies to the device.
Described by its creators as reliable, silent, environmentally friendly, the system is presented in the paper Performance Assessment of a Novel Eco-Friendly Solar Panel Mounted Hybrid Rotating Energy System with Renewable Energy Applications, which was recently published in IETE Journal of Research.

“ReneSola Power believes that the report contains inaccurate conclusions, misstatements of historical facts, errors, and superfluous opinions,” the project developer said in a short statement. “The Company is studying the report and will address the key inaccuracies with detailed explanations on its upcoming earnings conference call.”
In its report, Grizzly Research said that most of the company's PV projects in Europe do not exist.
“Our on the ground due diligence, ﬁlings review, and communications with local municipalities in Europe indicate that Renesola has been vastly misrepresenting its project development pipeline,” Grizzly Research explained. “Our research indicates that most of these projects seemingly do not exist. We were able to conﬁrm this in several cases with the local government authorities, which leads us to believe that Renesola might have fabricated projects to give the appearance of a better development pipeline and future economics.”
Grizzly Research is owned by Siegfried G. Eggert and defines itself as a company focused on producing differentiated research insights on publicly traded companies through in-depth due diligence.

“The assets are insufficient to set off its liabilities, the board of directors apply to the court for pronouncement of its bankruptcy,” Inventec said in a statement to the Taiwan Stock Exchange, noting liabilities of TWD 2.2 billion ($70.2 million).
The company blamed strong competition from foreign solar companies, trade barriers in Europe and the United States, and the Covid-19 outbreak as the main reasons for the collapse of Inventec Solar.
Inventec Solar applied to the Industrial Development Bureau for claims and liabilities negotiations in April 2020. It asked for a one-year extension of the repayment period of its long- and short-term loans.
Solar cell manufacturer E-Ton Solar Tech, another subsidiary of Inventec, closed its solar cell production facilities in Taiwan in 2019 and is now in liquidation.

Adani Solar retail head, Cecil Augustine, told pv magazine that the company's new module manufacturing line of 2 GW/annum capacity in Mundra, India, has started production. The company already has a 1.5 GW cell and module facility in Mundra. The latest addition has expanded its overall capacity to 3.5 GW.
The new 2 GW line will produce bifacial modules with power outputs above 500 Wp. Initially, it will produce 535 Wp modules with power conversion efficiencies of 21% and above. The plan is to bring out modules above 650 Wp in the near future. Adani Solar is a dominant player in retail solar sales, commanding more than 50% market share in rooftop solar.
Haryana-based Saatvik, which is currently the largest module manufacturer in northern India, has an 800 MW module factory in the state of Haryana. It will soon have a new 1.2 GW module factor in the state of Gujarat. The facility will start production by June 2022 and will manufacture mono PERC and mono facial modules with 21% efficiency. Initially, it will produce modules with 540 Wp to 550 Wp of output and upscale to 610 Wp after two to three months.
“We chose Gandhidham, Gujarat, for our new factory owing to its proximity to Kandla and Mundra ports. So, manufacturing in Gujarat will reduce freight costs for us in imports of raw materials like cells, aluminum frames, junction boxes,” said Pushpendra Samadhiya, national sales head-key account sales, Saatvik. “This strategic location shall also reduce our transportation costs for selling in southern India, and for exports to other countries.”

Amazon has followed its recently announced plan to invest in 274 utility-scale renewables projects throughout the world with the announcement of 18 new projects that it has procured in the United States and Europe, including eight U.S. solar projects.
The 18 projects have been procured across the United States, Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, and total 5.6 GW in combined capacity. The new utility-scale wind and solar projects bring Amazon’s total committed renewable electricity production capacity to more than 12 GW and 33,700 gigawatt-hours (GWh) once the projects become fully operational.
The 274 projects include 105 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 169 solar rooftops on facilities and stores. They include more than 1 GW of utility-scale solar projects in the United States, including Amazon’s first solar projects in Arizona and Georgia, and additional projects in Ohio, Texas, and Virginia, as well as Amazon’s second solar project paired with energy storage. This project, located in Arizona, clocks in as a 300 MW solar project, paired with a 150 MW battery energy storage system, which brings Amazon’s U.S. battery storage project capacity to 220 MW.
In total, Amazon has developed or acquired more than 6 GW of renewable energy in the United States via 62 projects. The company says it is now on track to power 100% of its business operations with renewable energy by 2025 – five years earlier than its original 2030 commitment.
At the end of October, Amazon tapped into its Climate Pledge Fund to invest in Resilient Power, a transformer-based EV fast charging maker, as part of its plan to have 100,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030. Resilient Power makes a solid-state transformer that integrates a traditional step-down transformer, charger, power management, and bidirectional inverter into a single device. The charger can handle solar and storage, vehicle to grid, and microgrid capabilities in the same unit.

MiaSolé, Solar Cloths, and Renault have teamed up to release a “shatterproof” 300 watt solar panel to be attached to the wind deflector of Renault trucks. The solar panel’s purpose is to help the vehicle run electric items while the truck is turned off. The panel can reduce or eliminate fossil-burning engine idling, thus reducing emissions.
The solar panel is made of MiaSolé’s thin film solar cells, and is combined into a custom solar panel by Solar Cloth. Although the product is not intended to directly increase the truck’s range, MiaSolé’s kits can replace diesel auxiliary power units, which typically burn diesel. Indirectly, then, this increases range by eliminating fossil fuel consumption used to power onboard electrical equipment when parked.
MiaSolé uses a solar cell with at least 18.64% efficiency, which produces a nearly 17% efficiency from the assembled solar panels. The company’s Solar Ride Kit datasheet from 2018 offers five different kits composed of one or two of its solar panels and a charge controller.
The data sheet lists the charge kit’s maximum power at 530 watts; however, the 60 Amp charge controller suggests up to 3.2 kW of maximum solar output. In addition to the shatterproof kit, MiaSolé’s website boasts a product line which can cover part, or even all, of a truck trailer.
These larger kits are more customizable, but they are still based on the charge controllers, and of course MiaSolé’s solar panels.
There is still much to debate over the solar energy generation benefits of moving a vehicle versus powering only its electrical equipment. However, the market has been getting creative, and evolving quickly.

Of course, extreme versions of solar powered vehicles exist — like the solar car races across Australia, and the Solar Team Eindhoven’s SolarCoach that recently traveled across Europe.
Fortunately, more accessible options have been appearing as well.
Sono has launched an IPO to raise money to develop and build its small, solar-powered city car. Tesla’s Cybertruck is expected to come with an option for solar panel option to cover its cargo bed, with the company suggesting that it would add 15 miles of range per day.
China’s SPI Energy also has announced its EdisonFuture EF1-T, a CyberTruck-esque vehicle which comes with a rooftop and cargo bed-covering solar panel kit.
Developments have not been confined to land-based transportation. Some boat manufacturers have equipped yachts with solar as a primary power source, as well as yachts with amenities complemented by solar power.

And while some may choose to scoff at the apparently low numbers of miles-per-day that vehicle-mounted solar panels provide, real world data suggests that we should give the prospect some serious consideration.
For one thing,  the average driving distance in the U.S. is somewhere between 20 to 40 miles per day. If a solar roof can add 10 miles or more, roof panels would provide 25 to 50% of miles driven purely on free sunlight, without even plugging in.
For another, it’s worth noting that Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems is advancing vehicle integrated solar panels.
In fact, Fraunhofer has put together a full team to help develop this research line. Work is focused both on large delivery vehicles, like the truck above, as well as technologies that integrate solar into car roofs.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/03/australian-solar-module-manufacturer-commits-to-recycling-strategy/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 3, 2021",Australian solar module manufacturer commits to recycling strategy,"From pv magazine Australia
Australian solar panel manufacturer Tindo Solar has committed to a recycling strategy for decommissioned panels, teaming with Reclaim PV in a bid to combat the growing number of used modules which are going to landfill.
Australia has one of the highest uptakes of rooftop solar in the world, with more than 3 million homes now using solar panel power but an increasing number of modules are entering the waste stream as they reach their end of life while others are being discarded prematurely as technological advances increase efficiency and reduce costs of new modules.
Researchers from the University of South Australia have estimated that more than 100,000 tonnes of solar modules will enter the waste stream by 2035 and currently almost all expired or discarded solar panels in Australia go into landfill.
Tindo chief executive officer Shayne Jaenisch said it is imperative the industry address the issue, revealing the group’s installation business is removing hundreds of end-of-life panels  each month, replacing them with the company’s own panels.
Jaenisch said the number of faulty, non-performing and end-of-life solar panels coming off rooftops presented the company with an opportunity to direct the old panels to the recycling sector.
“We recognise that a fully sustainable energy system requires a solution for its waste product, which in our industry is disused panels,” he said.
“Reclaim PV’s processes allow for a whole-life cycle approach to solar panels, meaning they needn’t become landfill. It’s a really important development in the energy transition.”
Tindo’s commitment follows Environment Minister Sussan Ley’s announcement earlier this year that the solar manufacturing industry must produce a “clear timeline” for establishing an industry wide recycling strategy for end-of-life technology with the government determined to avoid what she labelled a looming “landfill nightmare”.
The minister said the solar industry needs to design and present a finalised industry-led product stewardship scheme by June 2022 with the nationwide scheme to be operational by June 2023.
Reclaim PV director and founder Clive Fleming said Australia already has a solar panel disposal challenge on its hands and there is a need to accelerate the end-to-end recovery and recycling of solar panels.
“The establishment of a national recovery and recycling network is an absolute necessity for the PV industry,” he said.
Reclaim PV has developed recycling facilities in Adelaide and Brisbane and is establishing a national network of collection locations for solar modules to be recycled at its plants.
The company’s recycling system comprises a three-stage process of manual separation, thermal separation, followed by a chemical process that sees about an estimated 98% of the solar panel recycled. The recovered aluminium, silicon, copper, silver and glass – as well as recovered glue constituents – are then re-used in the manufacture of new products.
The junction box accounts for the 2% of the panel that isn’t currently being recycled but Reclaim PV is working with researchers to develop a solution.
“Waste is never waste. It is a resource, and we just need to treat it as such,” Fleming said. “This is the key concept of the circular economy, that nothing is wasted, and everything is re-used as part of a continuous cycle. But this doesn’t work unless we’re all playing our part.”
