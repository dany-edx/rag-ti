Local media outlets have reported that the investment includes $10 million from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Fund, alongside an additional $35 million from the government of Zimbabwe and local partners such as the Infrastructure Development Bank of Zimbabwe and Old Mutual Investment Group.
The fund – which has been developed by Unesco, UNWOMEN and the United Nations Development Programme, alongside the government of Zimbabwe – is expected to largely focus on leveraging private investments.
UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Edward Kallon said at Zimbabwe’s recent 5th International Renewable Energy Conference and Expo 2024 that the $45 million investment “signifies a concrete commitment to driving sustainable development and progress in our nation … By promoting the adoption of renewable energy sources, the United Nations supports the Government of Zimbabwe in mitigating climate change, improving energy access, and driving socio-economic progress.”
The government has also given the green light to 10 independent power producer (IPP) projects to start generating electricity within the next two years. The projects have a combined capacity of 271 MW and include six solar installations: the 10 MW Mutorashanga Indo Africa Solar plant, the 5.5 MW Guruve Solar array, the 50 MW De Green Rhino Solar plant, the 10 MW Equinox Solar project, the 10.5 MW Murombedzi Solar array, and the 30 MW Energywise Vungu Solar project.
Zimbabwe’s focus on renewables comes as it attempts to lessen its reliance on energy imports and improve access to electricity, as World Bank data shows that just 49% of the country had access in 2021. The country still faces significant power deficits, which contribute to regular power outages. A Zimbabwe Economic Update published by the World Bank in December said that the weak financial performance of energy companies, insufficient central planning, and limited private sector participation have been exacerbating problems with electricity supply and access.
Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa also said last week that the country is “ready to welcome more investors and partners to take up opportunities to promote new energy technologies and smart off-grid systems across the country …  Our statistics reflect that Zimbabwe is making steady progress in stabilising and increasing total energy output. However, more work must be done to ensure consistent access to clean energy across our provinces, including in rural communities.”
At the end of 2022, the government said it would expedite the commissioning of 27 solar IPP installations at a total cost of around $1 billion. Plans for Zimbabwe’s first utility-scale green hydrogen power plant, with 178 GWh of expected annual electricity production, were finalized in March 2023.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Zimbabwe had deployed 41 MW of solar by the end of 2022.

The Italian Exhibition Group (IEG) has revealed that the numbers of its KEY – The Energy Transition Expo trade show, which was held last week in Rimini, Italy – has exceeded all expectations. The event concluded with a 41% increase in total attendance from 2023, with the international presence growing by 60% – solidifying the event's status as an internationally recognized trade fair.
All major producers of PV modules and inverters, both Italian and international, showcased their stands in seven pavilions at the show. The event spanned 65,000 m2 and featured a 30% increase in exhibiting brands, totaling 830 companies, with 35% from abroad. It covered 16 pavilions, four more than in 2023, and hosted 120 conferences in the Expo Center pavilions.
The large number of Asian exhibitors underscored the event's significance as a leading trade fair for Italian and European photovoltaics, ranking second in Europe after Intersolar in Munich, Germany.
During the three-day KEY event, pv magazine Italy gathered feedback from exhibitors and visitors. The recurring theme focused on the growing interest in products aimed at the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment.
“I spoke continuously for three days and found a lot of interest in energy communities. A few days ago the operating rules of the Italian energy agency Gestore dei Servizi Energetici (GSE) were published, with some points that were not very transparent and understandable, but the GSE itself organized in-depth sessions during the fair and we now hope to have all the answers,” said Valerio Natalizia, CEO of SMA Italy, the Italian unit of German inverter manufacturer SMA. “We have noticed a lot of attention on storage, especially for commercial and industrial roofs and an increased interest in the utility scale. This fair is the litmus test that everything is going in the right direction and we are also confident in the interventions of an industrial incentive policy to protect European producers.”
Fabio Ottavi – general manager of Sonnen Italia, the Italian subsidiary of German battery manufacturer Sonnen – said that the trade fair went well.
“I consider this market response surprising, now in the process of adjusting after the end of the Superbonus. It is therefore officially a moment of relaunch, not so obvious,” he told pv magazine Italy. “I'll draw a parallel: when the incentive scheme Conto Energia ended, the sector fair, SolarExpo, moved from Verona to Milan, with a very disappointing result: a pavilion occupied with around 40 stands, with a very high percentage of exhibitors in the world of electric cars. Instead, here I see a desire to start again and especially in the C&I segment which is arousing a lot of interest. And this is also why we presented and dedicated the stand above all to a new product of this type. We have also noticed this among our competitors: a lot of offer and attention to solutions for the commercial and industrial sectors.”
Paolo Zorzi, product manager at Fischer Italia, told pv magazine Italia that there was significant interest and numerous inquiries about the company's products during the event.
“The hooks for sloping roofs with tiles have captured great attention and the public is varied and heterogeneous, interested above all in the aspects of ease of assembly afforded by the solutions,” said Zorzi. “This leverage is a thermometer of a positive market trend in the present and growing for the future.”
Elena Marchitelli, marketing manager for AIKO, a Chinese panel manufacturer, said the show offered an important opportunity to present the brand to the Italian public.
“It's nice to be able to hear the positive feedback up close and witness the many requests for further information from the publicm” said Marchitelli. “The affluence was very high, with visitors super interested in understanding more about the products.”
Simone Motta, vendor manager of Italian distributor Sacchi Elettroforniture, noted the large public turnout.
“The interest at our stand was not so much in inverters, panels and storage, which could be found in large quantities at this fair, but in related products, therefore the power distribution part, including the medium voltage substation,” he said. “In a market where residential is not growing and where the C&I part is increasing, power distribution products are increasingly fundamental. This is a great interest that we expected, as well as the visitor's attention to the possibility of contacting a single interlocutor, from the supply of the panel to the connection to the network.”
The visitors were mostly full of enthusiasm for the exhibition. However, there was a small percentage of people who complained about the large Asian presence at an Italian trade fair.
“We know that most of the technology is produced in China, but we expected an expo with more space for European [products],” one attendee told pv magazine.
Christian Previati, exhibition manager for KEY, noted the presence of storage technologies, which filled two entire pavilions.
“We believe there is still significant margin for growth, especially on large storage systems towards utility scale and C&I,” he told pv magazine Italy. “The next edition will be held from March 5 to 7, 2025 – dates that will allow us to have all the pavilions at our disposal, unlike this year. Being able to have them does not mean that we will automatically fill them. We plan to increase the number of occupied pavilions and better organize the future layout. This year, for example, we had to reject the last requests from companies that wanted to exhibit and we managed to satisfy some of the additional requests by opening pavilion C1.”
The event organizers have already started rebooking for the next show, with requests from both new and existing exhibitors to participate.
“We need to be more representative and therefore our criterion of choice will favor welcoming new companies that are appearing at the fair for the first time, rather than increasing the square meters of those who have already exhibited,” said Previati. “As regards the layout, in this edition we have already begun to segment the solar sector, which today occupies seven pavilions, moving the same type of technologies to nearby spaces. This is not yet a completed process, but it is well underway and will continue in this direction next year.”
This edition saw a significant increase in the presence of Chinese producers, who represent a substantial portion of the technology, but also European companies, including firms from Spain and Germany.
“All the panel manufacturers were present and it is a trend that will continue: it is the area from which we are receiving the most requests for expansions and positioning in recent days,” said Previati. “We expect further growth, and not simply in solar, which will embrace other rapidly developing sectors. I'm talking for example about heat pumps, already present in pavilion B5 in this edition, but which we are sure will increase by looking at the broader concept of energy efficiency of buildings and built environments, one of the prevalent areas of the energy transition.”

The deal will value the Italian group's subsidiary – Enel Libra Flexsys – at around EUR 2.5 billion, including debt.
Enel Libra Flexsys was established for the development and management of a major portfolio of energy transition infrastructure in Italy, composed of 23 BESS projects with a total capacity of 1.7 GW and three open-cycle gas turbine projects with a total capacity of 900 MW.
The deal is pending regulatory clearance and is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2024. The sale is aligned with Enel’s aligned with its strategy “to retain control of strategic assets while maximizing productivity and returns on invested capital” and part of its broader effort to reduce its net debt.
“This partnership with a leading player such as Sosteneo enables us to further accelerate the development of storage solutions supporting Italy’s energy system, optimizing capital allocation with the aim to create value for all stakeholders,” says Stefano De Angelis, CFO of Enel Group.
Sosteneo launched in September 2023 as part of insurance and asset management provider Generali Investment’s ecosystem, with a focus on equity investments in greenfield infrastructure projects related to the energy transition.
Prior to the Enel deal, the fund’s BESS fleet stood at 840 MWh. The projects under its management include: the 370 MWh Koorangie battery in the Australian state of Victoria developed by Edify Energy, 373.5 MWh Sheaf Energy Park in Kent, UK, and the neighbouring 99.8 Richborough Energy Park, both  developed by Pacific Green Technologies.

3,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/04/new-tech-to-remanufacture-recycled-perovskite-solar-cells/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,QUALITY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,GERMANY,MOROCCO,NETHERLANDS,NORTHERN AFRICA,SWITZERLAND,UNITED KINGDOM,WESTERN EUROPE",LIOR KAHANA,2024-03-04,New tech to remanufacture recycled perovskite solar cells,"A group of scientists has developed a novel method for remanufacturing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with carbon-based electrodes (CPSMs). They describe remanufacturing, as opposed to only recycling, as the combination of re-used, recycled, repaired, or replaced parts to make a new product.
“In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a remanufacturing strategy for glass-glass encapsulated perovskite solar cells,” they stated. “Our study presents a facile experimental method to remove the edge-sealant, encapsulant, back electrode, and degraded perovskite, allowing reuse of the device constituents.”
They initially researched which materials in a module are associated with high environmental impacts. The module they analyzed – which they say has high potential for commercialization – includes a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) front electrode, compact and mesoporous titanium dioxide (c-TiO2 and m-TiO2, respectively), zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), and a carbon-based back electrode. The device is encapsulated with thermoplastic olefins (TPO), polyisobutylene (PIB)-based edge seal, and a glass backsheet.
“Only a small part of the global warming potential (GWP) contribution of the cell stack comes from the materials itself (5%), while the majority originates from the energy and solvents used to deposit these layers,” they said. “The main GWP reduction can be achieved by re-using or recycling the glass (front and back), which can potentially reduce the GWP of PSMs by up to 53% and 52%, respectively. The photovoltaic cell constituents (and their embedded energy) have a relatively small contribution to the overall carbon footprint.”
The academics also determined which components were worth targeting. First, they heated the cell to 120 C to 140 C, to facilitate the mechanical separation of the backsheet glass from the FTO. Then, they left the glass substrates to cool down to room temperature before the encapsulant removal step.
To dissolve the TPO and PIB encapsulant, they placed them in acetone for one hour and peeled them off. Afterward, they dipped the devices into a bath of methylamine (MA0) and ethanol to liquefy and wash out the perovskite – the part most likely to deteriorate in the shortest time.
“The removal of perovskite and carbon allows reuse of the metal oxide layers (TiO2, ZrO2) deposited on the FTO  in order to remanufacture encapsulated CPSCs,” they explained. “The layer morphology and thickness are preserved. Therefore, carbon deposition and perovskite solution infiltration, followed by the encapsulation with TPO and PIB can be performed again to complete the remanufacturing loop.”
While the recycled solar cell had a power conversion efficiency of 11.7% after the remanufacturing process, they kept 88% of the original efficiency. Given the efficiency and the resources needed for the process, that led to a reduction of 24% GWP. If the process is further optimized, and the PCE remains the same after remanufacturing, the drop in GWP can reach 33%.

“Note that, despite fully re-using parts constituting 62.4% of the GWP, the reduction in GWP (compared to virgin modules) due to remanufacturing is substantially lower,” the researchers said. “This is because of the additional processes required for remanufacturing. Predominantly the chemical treatment in MA0/EtOH and acetone baths, but also the temperature-assisted mechanical separation of glass substrates and annealing at 400 C result in non-negligible CO2-eq emissions.”
The researchers also determined that the CO2 footprint of electricity generated by the remanufactured systems could be lower than that of c-Si. In the conditions of Freiburg, Germany, and an annual generation of 1429.2 kWh/m2, the remanufactured system needed 10.7 years to have lower CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour than c-Si modules. That compares with more than 16 years with the used virgin modules. If perovskite PV's efficiency reaches the efficiency of c-Si modules, the remanufactured footprint will be lower after five years.
“Remanufacturing strategy utilizes solvents and treatments that do not decompose inorganic device constituents, such as metal oxide layers,” the academic group said. “Thus, this approach can also be applied to a broad range of n-i-p devices and some inorganic p-i-n based ones, for which we expect similar reductions in GWP.”
They presented their findings in “Remanufacturing Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules–A Holistic Case Study,” which was recently published in ACS Sustainable Resource Management. The research group included scientists from Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE), the University of Freiburg and the Philipps University of Marburg, Switzerland's Solaronix, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne. Researchers from Energy21 in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom's University of Cambridge, and Morrocco's Abdelmalek Essaadi University also participated.

January’s deal count marked a drop from 26 PPA announcements in December, but was slightly higher than in January 2023. The total volume was 6% down month on month and lagged behind January 2023, when 1,194 MW were recorded. However, Pexapark said this was largely due to one big offshore PPA being signed in January 2023 that accounted for more than 580 MW.
Despite the fall in both volumes and deal count, Pexapark said the results for January 2024 mark continued momentum after a “golden year” for the European PPA market in 2023.
January saw all tracked PPA prices fall 12.8% month on month to end the month at €43.80 ($47,55)/MWh. Pexapark attributed this decline to lower power and commodity prices, which have fallen to multi-year lows. In particular, it said that German power contracts closed at two-year lows in January and predicted that they will continue to fall “amid bearish market fundamentals including mild weather, gas storage and carbon prices.”
Dutch and Polish PPA prices experienced the largest falls in January, down 16.3% and 15.7%, respectively, while French PPA prices saw the smallest movement, experiencing a 6.8% decline.
France announced more deals than any other country in January, with six totaling 179 MW. Pexapark said the majority were tied to solar assets, but the largest was a deal between Equinix and Wpd. Billed as one of the largest corporate PPAs in French history, the deal was for seven 20-year contracts representing more than 100 MW of capacity across five onshore wind projects.
Elsewhere, Germany saw a 15-year PPA linked to a 55 MW solar project between Lhyfe and EDPR Renewables. Set for launch in 2025 in the state of Thuringia, the agreement marks EDPR’s inaugural long-term corporate PPA venture in Germany, as well as its first collaboration with a green hydrogen producer.
Poland also had a strong January 2024. The country recorded two agreements, totaling 41 MW, including a 10-year deal revolving around a 21 MW solar asset between GoldenPeaks Capital Trading and Boryszew Green Energy & Gas, which is projected to generate 24 GWh of clean electricity per year.
Amazon was the lead buyer for the month, signing two deals with a collective capacity of more than 280 MW.

The company assessed the feasibility of a floating PV system on four reservoirs for different hydropower plants along the Nile River between the cities of Jinja and Karuma. The work evaluated the suitability of the different sites, comparing each against holistic criteria. 
Sweco International AB is leading a consortium to conduct the consultancy work. As part of the team, 8.2 Renewable Energy Experts Hamburg will accompany the project from planning to the tendering stage.
“We are proud to contribute to the promotion of renewable energy in Uganda and look forward to supporting this pilot project,” said Ralf Reek, the company's managing director.
The project, which is being funded by Sweden's Development Finance Institution, Swedfund, aims to promote the use of solar energy in Uganda while meeting the needs of the local population, environment and economy. It is expected to improve the supply of CO2-neutral, renewable electricity in the region, while also helping to create jobs and promote economic development.
Work focused on Uganda’s large water resources for energy development began in 2021.
In December 2023, the country’s Ministry of Water and Environment launched an auction inviting developers to build 40 solar energy water supply projects at 40 locations across the country. The tender for consultancy services on the project opened in January.
Uganda recorded 94 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2022, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

The LP182x199M66NH modules feature 182 mm x 199 mm n-type TOPCon cells and a fiberglass frame, which the manufacturer said is more resistant to corrosion than conventional frames.
“This composite material is used in applications such as wind turbine blades, to withstand wind pressure, vibration and centrifugal force, as well as railway tracks, to withstand the pressure and vibration of passing trains,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “Fiberglass-reinforced composite materials have been used for over 20 years in outdoor environments and fields with higher load requirements, with countless successful application cases.”
Leapton is offering three versions of the panels, with power outputs ranging from 560 W to 585 W. The efficiency ratings range from 21.68% to 22.65%. The open-circuit voltage is between 47.42 V and 48.42 and the short-circuit current is between 15.00 A and 15.27 A. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The panels measure 2,278 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh 28 kg. They also feature an IP68 enclosure and 3.2 mm heat-strengthened glass. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.30% per degree Celsius and an operational temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C.
The new products come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0%. The 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
Leapton Energy had a capacity of 600 MW in China at the end of 2020 and 2 GW at the end of 2022.
The manufacturer recently said it will raise the its annual production capacity to 3.5 GW. “In 2021, the company completed Phase 1 expansion to reach 2 GW. Phase 2 in 2023 brings the capacity to total 3.5 GW,” Global Sales Director, Leapton Energy, Jeff Chau told pv magazine.

Melbourne-headquartered solar company G-Store Pty Ltd. has collapsed, with the administrators, PCI Partners, revealing that more than 100 creditors are owed a combined AUD 3.8 million ($2.47 million)
G-Store, founded in 2007, was placed into administration on Feb. 2, 2024, with News Corp Australia outlets reporting that the company’s sole director had been diagnosed with cancer.
PCI Partners said most of the company’s workers were terminated on Feb. 7, with the remaining staff dismissed by close of business on Feb. 13.
In a statutory report lodged to the corporate regulator, PCI Partners said G-Store had total liabilities of AUD 3.8 million and more than 100 creditors.
The administrator said the company owes 139 unsecured creditors AUD 2.2 million, while secured lenders are owed the remainder of the AUD 3.8 million debt.
The list of unsecured creditors includes customers who have paid for solar systems to be installed, but those installations have not occurred.
“The company did not complete a number of works for which it had received deposits from customers,” the report reads. “Unfortunately, these customers will now rank as unsecured creditors for the deposits paid to the company.”
G-Store, which has a head office in the Melbourne suburb of Malvern East and another showroom at Warragul, Victoria, specializes in installing solar systems and associated renewables technologies for residential and commercial customers throughout Victoria.

The novel indicators are intended to help policymakers and project developers mitigate the environmental and visual impact of agrivoltaic facilities. “As to date relatively little research has been conducted on landscape change with respect to agrivoltaics, it is yet unclear what methods are useful,” the academics explained.
They initially collected case identification and spatial data from grey and peer-reviewed literature, as well as from fieldwork, interviews with farmers, orthophotos, and satellite images. Their analysis then considered 15 agrivoltaic facilities with a power of over 100 kW, a minimum intended project span of five years, and a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of five. The TRL measures the maturity of technology components for a system and is based on a scale from one to nine, with nine representing mature technologies, ready for full commercial application.
The 10 LCIs refer to land use change, crop change, change in vertical non-agricultural vegetation, change of relief, change of historical linear landscape structures, change in crop support system, change of fences, change of agrivoltaic system structure, change in the pattern of the agricultural landscape, and change in openness.
For each of the selected agrivoltaic sites, the scientists found a different number of LCIs, depending on the intensity of the visual and environmental impact. The maximum number of identified LCIs per case was six for a site in Almere, followed by facilities located in Babberich, Culemborg, and Wadenoijen sites with five, four, and three LCIs, respectively.
“The most frequently identified LCIs were change of agrivoltaic system structure, change in openness, and change of pattern of the agricultural landscape, which occurred in all cases,” the research group explained. “Crop change and change of historical linear landscape structures were not identified.”
Their analysis also revealed that the LCIs depend strongly on the design of agrivoltaic system and the characteristics of the site.
The LCIs were presented in the paper “Agrivoltaics and landscape change: First evidence from built cases in the Netherlands,” which was recently published in Land Use Policy. “Whereas this study focused on physical landscape changes, future research should examine the perceived changes in landscape quality due to the implementation of agrivoltaic systems,” the researchers concluded.

AmpIn Solar – a joint venture between AmpIn Energy Transition and Jupiter International – plans to set up a greenfield factory for 1.3 GW of solar cells and modules in Bhubaneswar, under the Indian government’s PLI scheme.
Naveen Patnaik, the chief minister of the Indian state of Odisha, attended the groundbreaking ceremony of the new PV manufacturing facility last week.
AmpIn Solar will use the PV modules in India and supply them to third-party developers.
The company said in October 2023 that it is planning significant renewable-energy investments in West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh.
The March edition of pv magazine, out next Monday, is dedicated to energy storage and considers sodium-ion’s chances of toppling lithium-ion, takes a look at compressed air technology, and asks whether big or small is the best approach for African solar and storage.
The company purportedly has the largest solar open-access portfolio in eastern India, at 200 MW. It also has a power purchase agreement (PPA) with CESC for a 250 MW wind-solar hybrid project, and a 10.5 MW behind-the-meter industrial solar project.

“Our new cell opens the door for wide bandgap perovskites solar cells, which will be crucial not just for applications such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) or solar windows, but also multijunction solar cells,” the research's corresponding author, Michael Saliba, told pv magazine. “Single junction perovskites with wide bandgaps have not reached high voltages yet.”
The scientists explained that the application of this material in solar cells is limited by the fast crystallization kinetics and poor solubility
of its precursors, which results in incomplete film coverage with an irregular film morphology.
To overcome this issue, the research group adopted a two-step deposition method and annealing under molecular nitrogen (N2) gas inside a glovebox. “We demonstrate that the annealing atmosphere strongly influences the crystallization kinetics of MAPbCl3 without changing its bulk property,” stated co-corresponding author, Mahdi Malekshahi. ” During annealing in the N2 atmosphere, MAPbCl3 films exhibit poor surface coverage with many voids and a high root-mean-square (RMS) of around 64 nm.”
The academics built the cell with a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), an electron transport layer (ETL) based on carbon–titanium dioxide (C/TiO2), a TiO2 mesoporous layer, the MAPbCl3 absorber, a Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting layer (HTL), and a gold (Au) metal contact.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 0.81%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.71 V, a short-circuit current density of 0.73 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 64.7%.
“It is noteworthy that such a high open-circuit voltage of 1.78 V is obtained for a wide-bandgap perovskite using conventional spiro-OMeTAD HTL,” the academics said, noting that the open-circuit voltage is the highest ever recorded to date for a perovskite solar cell based on MAPbCl3.
“Importantly, this is achieved with the same contacts that are used for the world-record efficiency perovskite solar cells with narrow bandgaps,” added Saliba. “Surprisingly, the conventional hole-transport layer spiro-OMeTAD, optimized for narrow bandgaps, sustains such high voltages.”
The solar cell concept was described in the paper “MAPbCl3 Light Absorber for Highest Voltage Perovskite Solar Cells,” which was recently published in ACS Publications.

12,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/04/massachusetts-expands-solar-net-metering-bucking-a-national-trend/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,2024-03-04,"Massachusetts expands solar net metering, bucking a national trend","From pv magazine USA
The Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) issued an order revising the state’s Net Metering Program regulations, expanding access to a broader solar customer base.
Net metering is a process by which solar customers export their excess electricity production to the grid in exchange for credit on their utility bills. The rate structure has been a primary driver in distributed, rooftop solar across the nation.
DPU’s order now allows municipal and state-owned solar asset owners to take advantage of net metering. It also enables the transfer of net metering credits between utilities. And large commercial solar facilities are exempt from net metering caps. These moves, along with a restructured cost recovery plan, are estimated to save ratepayers $10 million.
Massachusetts has tapped 10.8% of its rooftop solar generation potential, among the highest adoption rates in the country, according to Environment America. The new regulations are expected to help spur the deployment of solar facilities across the state, support Massachusetts’s move towards electrification, and cut costs for residents and businesses.
This regulatory change bucks a national trend set by California, a state that has sent its rooftop solar industry reeling with its transition to Net Energy Metering 3.0. After slashing its net metering credit rates by about 75%, among other moves, the state has suffered over 17,000 job losses, major bankruptcies, and a sharp drop in rooftop solar installations. Analysts say that California is now off-track for reaching its climate goals. Other major rooftop solar markets, including North Carolina, Arizona, and others have followed California in cutting net metering rates, despite the industry tailspin.
Meanwhile, Massachusetts has doubled down on net metering, recognizing the system-wide cost and resilience benefits of rooftop solar.
“Net metering enables customers to cut their energy costs,” said DPU chair James Van Nostrand. “This is another example of the important nexus between the clean energy transition and maintaining affordability for Massachusetts residents.”
Massachusetts sets caps on how much capacity of rooftop solar can be eligible for net metering. It used to have an exemption for small systems of 10 kW or less. Now, the exemption threshold is expanded to 60 kW, meaning that almost all residential accounts and many small commercial accounts are now eligible for net metering.
Changes to the program include:
DPU said the moves were made to help the state adhere to its 2021 climate action plan. The full summary of net metering revisions can be found here.
Why rooftop?
Recent modeling from Environment America found that rooftop solar has technical potential to meet 45% of U.S. electricity demand. Today, it only represents about 1.5% of the electricity used.
“Today, in Massachusetts, you can get your energy straight from your roof,” Neumann told lawmakers. “It’s making less and less sense to pay for power from a distant plant spewing pollution when we can soak up the sun on our rooftops.”
Rooftop solar “has myriad benefits for the environment and consumers,” said the report. This includes reducing the need for dirty power plants and expensive transmission lines, providing lower costs, which can help to increase the grid’s resilience to extreme weather and other shocks.
Distributed solar helps squeeze other emitting sources off the grid. Take the 1.4 GW Mystic Generating Station serving the ISO New England grid operator region. The natural gas plant used to be fired up in the winter to prevent blackouts, but the grid operator said increased solar capacity has made the grid reliable enough to shut Mystic down. Over 5.4 GW of solar, most of it rooftop, has helped enable the transition away from fossil fuels, even in the harsh New England winter.
Another environmental benefit of rooftop solar is the reduction of land use for energy development, sometimes referred to as “energy sprawl.” For each gigawatt of rooftop solar installed instead of utility-scale projects, over 5,200 acres of land are saved.
Further, rooftop solar can save the nation on rising transmission needs and costs.
“Because rooftop solar generates power that can be used on-site reduces the need for transmission from central generating stations, potentially saving states and municipalities time and money on their energy transitions,” said the report. “To reach renewable energy targets, some expansion of transmission infrastructure will be necessary, but maximizing the potential of rooftop solar can help to minimize the amount we need to build.”
Solar is also now the most cost-effective new generation source in most markets and most conditions in the United States. On average, new-build solar costs 29% less than the next-cheapest fossil fuel alternative, said Ernst and Young.
