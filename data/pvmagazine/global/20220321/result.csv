Chinese module manufacturer Longi announced its intention to challenge the recent decision with which the court of appeal in The Hague, the Netherlands, has decided to extend the preliminary cross-border injunction against its Dutch subsidiary Longi (Netherlands) Trading B.V. in the patent dispute with South Korea-based panel maker Hanwha Q Cells.
“Longi is very disappointed about this judgement and starts preparation of appeal to The Supreme Court of the Netherlands and the European Court,” the company said in a statement, adding it considers this judgment of a pre-litigation relief measures are incorrect in the application of law in various aspects. “The Company firmly believes that the related products are not infringing any of Hanwha's rights in the 11 countries.”
Longi emphasized that the injunction only affects the Dutch unit and has “no direct impact” on customers in other countries or other parts of the company. The injunction provides that Longi Solar's Dutch subsidiary may not encourage customers to infringe the EP ‘689 patent in countries where Hanwha Solutions Corporation is the registered owner. Longi Netherlands is not allowed to offer for sale, sell or distribute the modules related to the patent litigation in Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, France, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Austria, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.
“The business activities of Longi Netherlands with any countries other than 11 countries will not be affected,” the manufacturer went on to say. “In addition, to ensure that the interests of Longi’s customers are safeguarded to the best possible extent, Longi will also promptly deliver new products (include HIH, HIB, HIBD etc.) based on a different back-up technology, which have no risk whatsoever to infringe the cross-border injunction and can thus be offered freely in those 11 countries affected by this judgment.”
Longi added its new products have already achieved considerable sales in many countries within Europe and proved to meet the satisfaction of many customers. “We have a capacity of 6.5GW to ensure the demand of the European market. If there is a greater demand in the market, we can easily meet it by upgrading our existing production lines,” it concluded.
The patent dispute between the photovoltaic manufacturers dates back to spring 2019. In March 2019, Hanwha Q-Cells filed a patent infringement lawsuit in both Germany and the United States, and shortly afterward in Australia, against Longi, REC and a third defendent, JinkoSolar. According to the company, its three competitors have illegally used its patented technology in their products. In June 2020, the Regional Court of Düsseldorf in Germany ruled in favor of Hanwha Q-Cells in the first instance. REC and Longi Solar appealed against the decision, whereupon Hanwha Q-Cells initiated the preliminary enforcement of the decision. In Hanwha Q-Cells' view, Longi Solar and REC did not take sufficient measures to comply with the court-ordered recall obligation, which is why Hanwha applied for a fine.
That legal dispute, by which Hanwha Q-Cells wants to prevent the distribution of patent-infringing solar modules in European third-party countries, has been swelling since the summer of 2021. At that time, a court in Rotterdam ordered the seizure of a delivery of Longi solar modules.

Earlier this month, BloombergNEF published a report suggesting “a delivered hydrogen price of $6.59/kg is now sufficient to make green ammonia cheaper than ‘gray' ammonia, made from unabated natural gas on a short-run, marginal cost basis. This is just enough for a green ammonia facility in Germany to be competitive.” Of course, Bloomberg pointed out that prices in countries like Spain, India and China would be even more competitive. 
This week, Rystad Energy similarly predicted that a surging cost of blue and gray hydrogen in line with fossil fuel hikes increased the growing feasibility “of green hydrogen as an affordable and secure source of renewable energy in Europe”. 
According to Rystad, the war in Ukraine has “turbocharged” the green hydrogen production sector, which was already set to experience a boom year as it passed the 1GW milestone. Thanks to a 70% increase, Rystad predicts the cost of fossil fuel-linked blue and gray hydrogen could reach from $8/kg to $14/kg “in a matter of days”. For green hydrogen, however, since the invasion of Ukraine Rystad is predicting lower production costs of $4/kg, particularly in Spain, which looking to produce more than 4GW of green hydrogen by 2030. 
Swing support 
The market is well and truly swinging, and to add weight to that swing the EU has already announced plans for a €300 million funding package for hydrogen, as well as REPowerEU's Hydrogen Accelerator initiative to unhook the region from its dependence on Russian gas. 
Rystad Energy's head of hydrogen research Minh Khoi Le said “While industry and governments are heading in the right direction, their challenge is to lower the risks for green hydrogen investors and create incentives necessary to scale up quickly both the demand and supply. Fundamentally, a world where green hydrogen fulfills the role currently played by oil, gas and coal will look very different,” Le continued.
To realize that world green hydrogen production needs to increase to more than 10 million tons worldwide by 2030 and see its costs cut to at least $1.5/kg. 10 million tons might sound like a lot, but according to Rystad if green hydrogen and its derivatives were to replace gas and coal in Europe's power mix base case by 2030 it would need 54 million tons. 
Currently, Europe is working to produce 3 million tons of green hydrogen annually by 2030, while RePower Europe has set a target of 15 million tons per annum. Clearly, there remains an enormous gap, but the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine may just have swung the economics in green hydrogen's favor.

As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about material sourcing for batteries, lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.

The stainless steel, cold-rolled flat products affected – described as “essential for … energy equipment” by the European Commission on Wednesday – will suffer anti-subsidy duties of 21%, for Indonesian goods, and 7.5% for supplies from India.
Those levies will come on top of anti-dumping duties of 13.9-35.3%, for Indian products, and 10.2-20.2% for their Indonesian equivalents, applied by the European Union since November.
The European Commission said it was taking action against cross-subsidization of the industry by China.
The EU executive said, when Indonesia decided it wanted to create domestic demand for the nickel ore it produces in large quantities – rather than simply exporting the stainless steel raw material – it needed cheap Chinese finance, provided under the latter's continent-spanning, One Belt, One Road infrastructure drive.
In return for cheap credit, the commission said, China received bargain price nickel ore which resulted in a double whammy for European steelmakers faced with cheap Chinese imports and lack of access to Indonesian nickel ore thanks to export restrictions imposed in the latter country.

Masdar was launched by UAE sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company in 2006 and, in December, Abu Dhabi‘s publicly-owned utility Taqa announced it was taking a 43% stake in the venture, with the UAE state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) coming on board as a 24% stakeholder, and Mubadala retaining 33% of the company stock.
At the time, Masdar said the new shareholders would see it have more than 23GW of operating and planned clean energy generation capacity with the aim of rising to “well over” 50GW this decade.

Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.

A statement published by Masdar on the PR Newswire press release service today – to report growth in the company's clean generation capacity last year – said: “Last December, it was announced that three of the UAE's energy giants – Adnoc, Taqa and Mubadala – will partner under the Masdar brand to form a clean energy powerhouse with a combined current, committed, and exclusive capacity of over 23GW of renewable energy, with the ambition of reaching over 200 GW.”
The reorganization of the renewables developer was signed in the UAE pavilion at the Expo 2020 event in Dubai, which was delayed for a year by Covid-19 and will close at the end of this month.
The clean power collaboration will see Masdar encompass the Abu Dhabi Hydrogen Alliance founded by Adnoc, Taqa, and Mubadala in January last year as well as the renewables venture established by Adnoc and Taqa in November.
The change in Masdar ownership was accompanied by a change in stock for the company's hydrogen unit, which Taqa said in December would be 43% held by Adnoc and 24% by the emirati utility, with Mubadala retaining 33%.
The statement released by Taqa at the time stressed the hydrogen venture would focus on the green form of the energy carrier.
Masdar today said its installed and under-development renewables generation capacity rose last year from 10.7GW to more than 15GW in a portfolio worth more than $20 billion.

Slovakia-based Agora Solar a.s. is planning to set up a 150MW solar module factory in Vranow, in the eastern part of the country. The company said it has already identified a suitable building in an industrial park located in the area and that production capacity may eventually reach 500MW by 2024. Production activities, with a 50MW production line, are expected to start in the second quarter.
The manufacturer primarily wants to serve niche markets. “The range of solar cells and module sizes has increased considerably in recent years, with the disadvantage that certain performance classes are often only available for a limited time,” the company said in a press release. However, other solar modules, especially those with larger dimensions, could not be used for certain photovoltaic systems. “This is an interesting market segment,” it explained.
Agora Solar deliberately chose a production line that can be converted to other formats in a short time, noting that it also plans to manufacture semi-transparent, glass-glass modules for building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems. These products should have a degree of transparency of up to 50% and also be suitable for application in agrivoltaics. Almost all solar modules should also have a bifacial configuration, with the company being ready to offer a 30-year performance guarantee.
In addition to Slovakia, Agora Solar wants to sell its products in Czechia, Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
Due to the proximity to Ukraine, part of the factory's halls that are still empty are currently being used for sorting and distributing clothing and donations for the refugees. “With the start of production, some of the refugees, who are suitably qualified, will be trained and employed in a few months,” the company said.

“There is wide spectral tunability with the organic semiconductors to tune the light that is absorbed by the solar cells and the light that gets transmitted to the plants,” NCSU researcher, Brendan O'Connor, told pv magazine. “Our work shows that this transmission spectrum can not only support healthy plant growth but may be used to promote gene expression in crops for desired characteristics.”
According to him, this spectral tunability, along with relatively high power conversion efficiency, is the key opportunity with organic solar cells. “Traditional opaque solar cell technologies block too much light,” he further explained.
In the paper “Beyond energy balance in agrivoltaic food production: Emergent crop traits from color selective solar cells,” published in bioRXiv, the research group explained that each filter was made with 12 organic PV units which each measured 20cm by 10cm, and which were arranged in a single layer on a substrate made of PEDOT:PSS coated onto a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate.
The filters were placed on top of boxes designed to house the lettuce within a climate-controlled growth chamber. The boxes were positioned at the same height from the floor of the growth chamber so that similar amounts of light reached the plants in each treatment. “As expected, there were fewer differences between treatments when light intensity was controlled,” the scientists explained. “The spectral differences between the three OSC filters alone were not great enough to have a significant effect on biomass.”

The crop growth of the filter-covered boxes was compared to that of two reference boxes covered with a clear-glass or shaded control. “Our experiments were designed to account for both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of OSC-filtered light on lettuce as a representative crop,” the academics specified.
The researchers used transcriptomic analysis to assess the key modifications of the plants grown under the solar filters. Transcriptomics is the analysis that is able to provide the sum of all of the RNA transcripts of an organism. Comparing transcriptomes allows the identification of genes that are differentially expressed in distinct cell populations or in response to different treatments. “The advantage of a transcriptome analysis in the study of OSC-grown plants is that these key modifications can be identified without the need to directly measure each aspect of plant growth and development,” they emphasized.
Through this analysis tool, the academics found the physiology of the plants was altered by the differences in light quality under the OSC filters, on a molecular and transcriptomic level. According to them, the boxes are not only able to produce different crop species at an affordable cost but also to enable growers to fine-tune plant characteristics by selecting from the wide range of OSC transmission spectra.
In a previous study, the same research group analyzed the growth of red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa) in a greenhouse equipped with organic solar cells coated with filters that can manage both near-IR (NIR) and long-wavelength (LW) IR. Their analysis showed that the organic solar cells contribute to reducing overheating in the greenhouse and that lettuce growth proceeded unabated under the solar cells as the different transmission spectra had no impact on the fresh weight of the plants.

“The various parts of the plant are now mostly in place,” the consortium said in a statement. “Rock caverns and connecting tunnels have been constructed in the rock and a ventilation shaft has been drilled from the top of the rock down to the upper part of the rock cavern.”
The three companies are investing a total of around SEK 200 million ($21.1 million) in three equal parts in the new facility and the Swedish Energy Agency is contributing SEK 50 million. “Intensive work is underway at the moment to complete and inspect all installations, while the facility’s steel lining is being welded together in the cavern,” the statement reads.

The 100-cubic-meter “Hybrit” facility will be built approximately 30 meters below ground. It is expected to begin operations in 2022 and will reach full capacity in 2024.
The cavern is being built via the so-called lined rock cavern (LRC) approach, which involves covering the walls of the cavern with a selected material as a sealing layer.
A recent study by the Jülich Institute for Energy and Climate Research (IEK-3) showed that salt caverns offer a flexible, efficient option for hydrogen storage. The research group estimates that Europe has the technical potential to store 84.8 PWh of hydrogen in bedded salt deposits and salt domes.
The IEK-3 researchers said the proximity of the caverns to the coast will be helpful, as brine disposal remains economical up to 50 km from the sea.

The scientists explained that SOFCs are generally utilized for stationary applications, in particular with combined heat and power systems, thanks to the high temperature at which they can operate. These devices, however, are generally considered less suitable for vehicles due to their lower power density and the limited thermal cycling robustness of their ceramic anode.
In the proposed fuel cell configuration, the ceramic anode was replaced with metallic interconnects. “The monolith concept integrates the cell support, gas channels, and the interconnects into a single layer, thereby reducing the stack height by a factor of 2–4,” the researchers explained, noting that the metal-based monolith stack is significantly cheaper than a conventional stack. “This considerably increases the volumetric density and specific power of the stack, which are important parameters considering the space and weight constraints in vehicles.”
Furthermore, the high metal content of the SOFC is claimed to lower temperature differences across the stack and offer more robustness to fast thermal cycles during operation, which the scientists said could be important when combining the fuel cell with electric batteries in a vehicle. “Previous work on monolithic SOFCs designs were reported by Saint-Gobain, which developed fully ceramic monolithic SOFC stacks, and by Argonne National Laboratory, which designed metal-supported SOFC stacks (‘TuffCell'),” the research group stated. “However, our concept of metal-based monolithic SOFCs comprises several significant differences when compared to the one developed by Argonne National Laboratory, such as the processing techniques to integrate gas flow channels, the electrode materials and thicknesses, and the concept of integrated seals.”
A monolith SOCF with an active cell area of around 18 cm2 was built through four processes – tape casting, lamination, co-sintering, and catalyst infiltration – which the scientists described as common techniques utilized in fuel cell manufacturing. The device was found to have an open-circuit voltage of 1065mV and a power density of5.6 kW/L, which the researchers said are on par with the best performing fuel cells based on ceramic anodes. ” We speculate that this design, or similar, could enable large-scale production of electrified transportation powered by fuel cells with considerably increased range, decreased charging times, and lower cost,” they concluded.
The fuel cell tech is introduced in the paper Production of a monolithic fuel cell stack with high power density, published in nature communications. The research team includes academics from the Technical University of Denmark and Norwegian research entity Sintef.

Australian energy utility AGL confirmed at the weekend it has received approval from the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Planning and Environment (DPIE) to build a 500MW big battery, with up to four hours of storage, at the site of the soon-to-be-closed Liddell power plant near Muswellbrook in the Hunter Valley.
The grid-scale lithium-ion battery energy storage system is part of AGL’s plans to establish an integrated, low-carbon energy hub at the site of the ageing coal-fired generator that is to be shuttered early next year.
AGL said the first unit of Liddell is due to close next month, with the remaining three units to close in April 2023.
Planning documents indicate the big battery will have at least a 20-year operational life and will be built in three stages. The first phase of the project involves the installation of 150MW of battery storage. Work on Phase 1 is expected to be complete by the time the coal-fired plant shuts down.
NSW Treasurer Matt Kean said the Liddell battery would play an important role in supporting the transition of the energy sector to renewable power generation as coal-fired generation is increasingly withdrawn.
“Big batteries combined with solar, wind and pumped hydro will help to deliver some of the cheapest and most reliable energy to the families and businesses of NSW,” he said.
The approval of the Liddell big battery comes just weeks after AGL announced it had fast-tracked the closures of its two biggest coal-fired power plants by several years.
AGL said the 2,640MW Bayswater power station in the Hunter Valley will be shuttered “no later than” 2033, two years ahead of its previously scheduled closure of 2035, while the 2.210MW Loy Yang A plant in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley will now close by 2045 rather than 2048.
Fellow gen-tailer Origin Energy has also brought forward plans to close its coal-fired Eraring power station in the Hunter region, announcing last month the 2,880MW plant will be closed in August 2025, seven years earlier than previously scheduled.
AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said the transition of the Liddell coal-fired power plant into a renewable energy hub would mark the company’s first rehabilitation of a thermal coal site.
“This planning approval marks a significant milestone for the transition of the Liddell site,” he said. “We look forward to working with partners to progress other developments on and around the site, including a wind farm, a solar storage system, pumped hydro, a waste-to-energy plant and our recently announced green hydrogen pilot with Fortescue Future Industries (FFI).”
The Liddell battery forms part of AGL’s plans to add 850MW of grid-scale batteries to its portfolio by 2024.
Construction had has already started on a 250MW/1GWh battery being developed at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia.
It has also lodged a planning application to construct a 200MW/800MWh battery at its Loy Yang power station. AGL has already received the tick of approval from NSW planning authorities for a 50MW/100MWh battery in Broken Hill and has announced support for battery projects at Wandoan (100 MW) in Queensland and Maoneng (4 x 50MW) in NSW. It is already operating the 30 MW/8MWh BESS at Dalrymple in South Australia.
Brokhof said firming technology like grid-scale battery storage would be critical to the ongoing integration of renewable sources into the national grid.
“As Australia moves forward and we increase our reliance on renewable generation, batteries will be critical in providing the storage needed to maintain a consistent, reliable and affordable energy system,” he said.
“All of these developments will benefit from the excellent resources and infrastructure these sites feature and create the jobs of the future across many industries, not just energy.
“This is a trend that is already happening overseas with more than 150 energy hub projects announced globally, all of them aimed at creating new business development opportunities and value creation.”
The planning approval for the Liddell battery comes as AGL continues to progress its plan to split into two listed entities – energy retailer AGL Australia and electricity generator Accel Energy – by June 30.
Under the proposal, AGL Australia would own its retailing division and some cleaner generation assets, while Accel Energy would house its fleet of coal- and gas-fired power stations.
As part of the demerger, AGL has outlined plans to diversify these thermal power sites into renewable energy hubs, which may include big batteries, hydrogen production and carbon capture and storage.
Earlier this month AGL rejected a $9 billion buyout offer from a consortium including software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management, saying the offer understated the value it believes will be unlocked through the demerger, including its vision for energy hubs.

The US Department of Energy (DOE) today released an action plan to enable the safe and responsible handling of solar photovoltaic (PV) end-of-life (EOL) materials. In order for solar to truly be a “clean” technology, it is imperative to have a plan for the disposal of solar panels at the end of their useful life. The current lifetime for solar panels is about 30 years, and while the solar industry grew slowly for several decades, about 70% of existing solar energy systems were deployed within the last five years.
The International Renewable Energy Agency forecasts that the cumulative end-of-life waste from PV in the US in 2030 is projected to be between 0.17 and 1 million tons. For perspective, there are 200 million tons of solid waste, excluding recycled and composted materials, generated in the United States each year.
Although 95% of a cadmium telluride (CdTe) and silicon (Si) solar module is recyclable, the current cost to recycle solar modules is around $15-$45 per module, while the landfill fee is $1-$5 per module, not including transportation costs. Recycling processes that have been developed in the US for CdTe and Si solar modules also cost more than the value of materials obtained from recycling.
“As we accelerate deployment of photovoltaic systems, we must also recognize the pressing need to address end-of-life for the materials in a sustainable way,” said Kelly Speakes-Backman, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the US Department of Energy.
The DOE Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) is funding research to improve the performance, lower the cost, and support widespread deployment of solar. Research areas that SETO will focus on include reliability and durability to increase the operating life of solar PV systems, lowering the resource-intensity of manufacturing, improving solar module recycling processes, and understanding environmental and health impacts of the EOL options. In addition, SETO will support research on how to cut the cost of module recycling by more than half by 2030. Overall, the plan is to reduce the environmental impact of solar energy while supporting the Biden Administration’s goal to decarbonize the electricity grid by 2035.
