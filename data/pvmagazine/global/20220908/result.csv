The energy speech this week by the commission's president, Ursula von der Leyen, specifically announced the EU executive's desire to cap wholesale electricity prices as separate measures for low-carbon and fossil fuel generators. Von der Leyen set out revenue limits for renewables and nuclear power companies as the second of five energy crisis measures put forward by the commission, with a similar move for fossil fuel companies labeled the third measure.
This implies that the proposed income ceilings could be set at different levels for low-carbon and conventional power generators. That prospect was opposed by SolarPower Europe, which called for any limit on energy company revenue to be applied “after market clearing.” Such a move would leave any maximum electricity price for households and businesses still tied to, at least, the generation cost of gas – currently the most expensive source of electricity.
The clearing system which sets the pan-European wholesale price for electricity – the figure received by generators for each kilowatt-hour they produce and sell on the wholesale market – involves each generator “bidding” their generation costs, from around zero for renewables up to the cost of operating gas plants. Demand is then satisfied by working up from the cheapest wholesale power source until the required volume of energy is met, at which point every generator selling into the wholesale market receives the price of the final, and therefore most expensive, electricity provider.
‘Solidarity contribution'
“We will propose a cap on the revenues of companies that are producing electricity with low costs. The low-carbon energy sources are making, in these times – because they have low costs but they have high prices on the market – enormous revenues,” Von der Leyen said. “Revenues they never calculated with; revenues they never dreamt of; and revenues they cannot reinvest to that extent. These revenues do not reflect their production costs. So, it is now time for the consumers to benefit from the low costs of low-carbon energy sources like, for example … renewables.”
By contrast, seemingly, the commission president said oil and gas companies would be expected to make a “solidarity contribution” – language which implied that the higher generation costs incurred by fossil fuel generators could be reflected in a higher revenue ceiling for each kilowatt-hour sold into the wholesale market.
SolarPower Europe took issue with the commission president's statement that renewables generators are all enjoying the same sort of bumper profits as fossil fuel companies. It said the prevalence of fixed clean-power prices meant, for example, that around two-thirds of renewables generators in Germany are not making windfall profits.
“Most solar farms are not earning the wholesale electricity price,” the trade body said in a statement published this week on its website, in response to Von der Leyen's speech. “They get a fixed price for the electricity they produce, either from a government-backed support scheme or a power purchase agreement (PPA) with an industrial consumer and should, therefore, not be subject to windfall measures.”
That statement skirts the fact that PPA prices have more than doubled in some parts of Europe since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February forced up already rising Covid-rebound gas prices to eye-watering levels, prompting the emergency measures under discussion. Less contentiously, SolarPower Europe called for any cap on revenue to be applied at a pan-European level – perhaps reflecting nervousness about permitting more renewables-skeptic member states of the bloc the freedom to impose thumping taxes on clean power companies – and also said any income ceiling should be time-limited, to preserve the functioning of the EU's internal energy market.
More incentives
SolarPower Europe also called for more incentives for solar deployment, including the use of pandemic recovery and resilience facility funding provided to European member states by Brussels. Reflecting on the much-discussed need to decouple electricity prices from gas, it said encouraging the deployment of solar-plus-storage sites – alongside limiting electricity consumption through demand-response measures – would be a big step in the right direction.
The commission will now seek to convince the energy minister members of the European Council of the merits of its five energy crisis measures, which also include a price cap on Russian gas, financial support for energy utilities, and a mandatory reduction in electricity use at peak periods. The Guardian reported this week that the commission wants to impose a 5% reduction and that member states have suggested such a move should be voluntary.
SolarPower Europe said the proposed measures should not jeopardize clean power investment. In the United Kingdom, Solar Energy UK is considering trying to pre-empt the imposition of the sort of windfall tax called for by Von der Leyen in the EU by voluntarily suggesting a switch from fixed-income government incentives to the contracts-for-difference model employed since 2017, which limits losses to the public purse.
New prime minister Liz Truss this week outlined the UK government's energy price guarantee which will see the state subsidize domestic electricity costs for two years and business prices for six months, from October 1. The government will refund any difference in generation costs for electricity suppliers in order to cap the typical household bill at an average £2,500 (€2,870) per year, with an equivalent scheme announced to support businesses.
As part of the policy, the government will pay the costs of the UK clean energy incentives program instead of the charges being paid by energy consumers for the duration of the price guarantee.

In the town of Dietfurt, Germany, Technische Universität München (TUM) simulated the energy system of the future for a period of six months. Seven households were involved in the “BASE.V” project, which tested electricity trading between neighbors.
The project was designed to investigate what would happen in the power grid if the number of households that produce their own electricity with PV systems, storage and electric cars continues to increase in the future. The results show that the purchase and sale of electricity can reduce consumption peaks and avoid grid bottlenecks when there is an economic incentive. In other words, grid stability benefits from smart energy management.
The industrial partner for the research project, which was funded by the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, was German battery provider Sonnen. It equipped the seven test households in Bavaria with PV systems, batteries and electric cars with charging stations. The participants could then buy or sell the electricity via a central peer-to-peer trading platform. The individual trading orders were executed via “smart contracts,” which were processed via a blockchain run by German automation solutions specialist Moxa.
“The special requirements of a field experiment have confirmed the easy remote maintenance capability of our IoT platform. Not a single change required an on-site visit from our experts,” said Martin Jenkner, project manager for Moxa Europe. “We were able to remotely manage any update we wanted to the gateway throughout the trial.”
The successful pilot test was also an important indicator for the involved network operators.
“More than 350,000 decentralized generation systems are already feeding into the regional power grid of Bayernwerk Netz GmbH. In addition to the increasing number of decentralized photovoltaic systems on the generator side, there are more and more heat pumps and electric cars on the consumer side,” said Stefan Bergermeier, a project manager for Bayernwerk Netz. “Together with a high level of simultaneous consumption and generation, this represents a major challenge for the local grid.”
The project showed that incentives-based, neighborhood electricity trading complemented the necessary grid expansion in a sensible manner.
“Peer-to-peer trade between households is not a dream of the future, but can be implemented today with the technical possibilities,” said Susan Käppeler, country manager for Sonnen DACH. “Both in terms of storage options and intelligent control. In order to make such solutions accessible to people, we need a digital energy infrastructure in which smart meters are the absolute basic requirement.”

It said it will also develop other high-efficiency solar technologies, such as tandem and perovskite solar cells, but it did not provide any additional details. The move is part of a KRW 760 billion ($548.8 million) plan to expand its solar business in South Korea. The plan includes KRW 130 billion for its TOPCon line and R&D activities, a KRW 590 billion investment for the production of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) for solar module backsheets, and KRW 41.7 billion for the production of EVA sheets. 
The company said it will set up EVA production in partnership with GS Energy, a unit of South Korean conglomerate GS Group, at the Yeosu Industrial Complex in Jeollanam province. The manufacturing facility will have an annual capacity of 300,000 tons.
“Through this joint venture, Hanwha Group's EVA production capacity, including Hanwha Solutions, will increase to a total of 920,000 tons,” the company said.
Hanwha Solutions recently agreed to buy a 16.67% stake in Norway-based polysilicon manufacturer REC Silicon ASA for $160.4 million. In the United States, REC Silicon owns and operates a polysilicon factory in Moses Lake, Washington, and another facility in Butte, Montana. Hanwha Solution also operates a 1.7 GW solar module factory in the United States and is currently considering the construction of a second factory there.

France's Ministry of Ecological Transition has published new solar and wind statistics for the first six months of 2022. The figures show that the country reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 15.1 GW at the end of June, with 14.5 GW of the total located in mainland France.
The ministry said new PV systems with a combined capacity of 1,098 MW were connected to the French grid in the first half of the year, from 1,534 MW a year earlier. About 607 MW of the total was deployed in the first quarter and 491 MW in the second quarter.
Installations above 250 kW account for around 51% of the newly installed capacity. Installations below 9 kW in size represent 13% of the newly installed capacity. In the first half of the year, solar production reached 9.6 TWh, up 32% from the same period in 2021.
The regions of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur accounted for 65% of all new capacity additions in the first six months of the year. They are the regions with the highest installed capacities, representing 66% of all cumulative power connected in France by the end of June.

The five ground-mounted and floating solar projects will range in capacity from 2 MW to 10 MW. The selected developers will build the facilities on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis and will be awarded 20-year power purchase agreements. The deadline to submit project proposals is Oct. 27.
In late August, the CEB launched a tender for the development and construction of a 100 MW solar plant in Siyambalanduwa, Uva province.
According to a recent joint study by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Asian Development Bank, Sri Lanka has the potential to deploy 16 GW of solar power. It aims to cover its entire power demand with renewables by 2050. By the end of 2021, the country had 434 MW of installed solar power, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Through its Soorya Bala Sangramaya program for solar energy, Sri Lanka hopes to add 1 GW by the end of 2025.

Rising gas and electricity prices have led consumers to invest in renewable energy sources, with companies likewise raising prices in the face of unprecedented demand and the lack of a specialized workforce.
“The prices charged by professionals and companies have grown exponentially, mainly due to the scarcity of labor and materials,” said Alice Nunes, director of new business at Fixando.
According to Fixando, 55% of requests done through its platform went unanswered in July. And less than 10% of companies listed on the app are offering new appointments.
The districts in which Fixando registered the most requests are Lisbon (17%), Porto (15%), Setúbal (10%), Aveiro (9%), Braga (8%) and Leiria (8%). Most users look for such services for houses with areas larger than 100 square meters (89%). Despite the increase in prices, 42% of them plan to connect their solar panels to the grid, with only 25% preferring to remain off-grid.
Fixando conducted the study between July 1 and Aug. 25. It surveyed 2,600 users and 1,200 professionals who are registered on its platform.

Researchers from the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have achieved breakthrough levels of stability and efficiency with a new perovskite solar cell, according to results published in Nature. The project was conducted in partnership with University of Colorado, Boulder, and the University of California, San Diego. 
A new architectural structure enabled the perovskite solar cell to demonstrate a certified 24% efficiency level, while retaining 87% of its original output capability after 2,400 hours of operation at 55 C. 
Perovskites are defined by their crystalline structure. They are actively being researched throughout the world for their ability to be manufactured at scale as readily printable materials that can be deposited as paper-thin solar cells.  
The flexible, lightweight cells are hailed for their numerous uses, like on low-load roofs, in aviation, wearables, and rapid delivery and rollout in disaster situations. Perovskites are naturally occurring minerals, but they also represent lab-made crystalline structured materials that imitate the natural minerals’ shape. 
Perovskites have made leaps and bounds in their efficiency. However, the material currently struggles with stability, in part because temperature sensitivity causes them to degrade relatively rapidly. The earliest perovskites worked for only a few minutes or hours, but today they have a lifespan of several months.
The NREL research project employed the use of an “inverted” architecture, rather than the latest architecture that has unlocked record efficiencies. The inverted structure is achieved by using a different layering technique in the glass substrate the perovskite crystals are deposited into.
The team also made use of a new molecule on the surface of the perovskite, 3-(Aminomethyl) pyridine (3-APy). The molecule reacted to the formamidinium within the perovskite to create an electric field on the surface of the perovskite layer.
“That suddenly gave us a huge boost of not only efficiency but also stability,” said Kai Zhu, a senior scientist at NREL.
The newly introduced molecule boosted efficiency from under 23% to over 25%. Zhu described the results as “state-of-the-art levels of efficiency and operational reliability.”
The project was funded by the Center for Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Semiconductors for Energy (CHOISE), an Energy Frontier Research Center within DOE’s Office of Basic Energy Sciences, and from the DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO).

Solar and wind power are expected to produce 40% of electricity by 2030, and the rising electrification of space heating and cooling will play a major role in those gains.
High-efficiency electric heat pumps will be the main technology driving reduced emissions from heating in the building sector, according to the agency’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) scenario. New fossil fuel boilers are expected to be fully phased out by 2025.
Nordic European countries and France lead the market share of heat pumps, due to high end-user acceptance and awareness of their more competitive total life-cycle costs. In Sweden, 29% of heating demand from buildings is covered by heat pumps. In Finland, the corresponding figure is 15%.
In regions where heat pumps can meet demand for cooling as well as heating, like the United States and Japan, the technology also accounts for a large share of the heating market. In the United States, about 40% of new single-family homes are heated by heat pumps.
The European Commission’s REPowerEU plan suggests doubling the deployment rate of heat pumps to 10 million units within the next five years, in order to reduce the dependence on Russian natural gas. In the United States, heat pumps have been identified as one of five key technologies in the Defence Production Act (DPA). The IEA recommends that taxes and subsidies should support the deployment of heat pumps, by shifting fees linked to higher saturation of renewable energy sources from electricity prices to fossil fuel prices, for example.

The device uses moisture in the air to directly generate hydrogen via electrolysis, without any input of liquid water. The module consists of a water harvesting unit in the middle and electrodes on both sides paired with gas collectors. It can be paired with both photovoltaic and wind power generators, as well as with any generator relying on renewable energy sources.
The water harvesting unit also works as the reservoir to hold the electrolyte.
“Porous medium such as melamine sponge, sintered glass foam is soaked with deliquescent ionic substance to absorb moisture from the air via the exposed surfaces,” the scientists said. “The captured water in the liquid phase is transferred to the surfaces of the electrodes via diffusion and subsequently split into hydrogen and oxygen in situ which are collected separately as a pure gas, since both electrodes are isolated from air.”
They said the reservoir between the endplate and the porous foam acts as an air barrier and a buffer for the ionic solution at the excessive fluctuation of the air humidity. They noted that it avoids the overflow of the electrolyte from the DAE module or the dry-up of the wetted foam.
“The foam filled with ionic solutions forms a physical barrier that effectively isolates hydrogen, oxygen, and air from any mixing,” they said.
The group built two prototypes relying on solar and wind power. They constructed the solar-driven free-standing hydrogen tower with a solar panel and five DAE modules stacked in parallel.
“The footprint of the tower is no more than the solar panel, meaning our DAE will not occupy extra land, which can be costly in some areas,” they said.
The proposed system configuration was tested for twelve days with an outdoor temperature varying from 20 C to 40 C and the relative humidity ranged from 20% to 40%. The device was able to produce around 1500 ml of hydrogen in a day and showed a Faradaic efficiency of around 95%. The Faradic efficiency is the measure of the efficiency with which the electrons participate in a given electrochemical transformation.
“After keeping the above DAE module unattended in air for eight months, the Faradaic efficiency of hydrogen remains around 90%, without any maintenance,” the academics said. “The prototype achieved automated steady hydrogen production depending on the solar intensity under varying weather conditions.”
The scientists presented the novel tech in “Hydrogen production from the air,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.
“Further improvement of the surface-to-volume ratio by engineering channels or increasing the aspect ratios of the sponge material will guarantee the rate of water uptake which is essential to the upscaling of the DAE units,” they concluded.

Research on this area has largely focused on the material’s sensitivity to moisture, high temperatures, and other environmental conditions. Potential-induced degradation (PID), caused by currents leaking from the cell and driving various damaging mechanisms, has long been a threat to performance in silicon PV modules, but has so far been much less explored in emerging PV technologies such as perovskite.
Scientists led by Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) evaluated the PID susceptibility of perovskite-silicon tandem devices fabricated in its lab. They found that more work may need to be done on the issue before perovskites can be commercialized and deployed at scale.
“No investigation into PID effects in perovskite/silicon tandem devices … has been published in the literature, despite the importance of PID robustness for commercialization,” the group stated. “This motivates us to evaluate here the impact of a high system voltage on encapsulated perovskite/silicon tandem devices, provide insights into its root causes and formulate mitigation strategies.”
Industry guidelines for PID testing, outlined in the IEC 61215 standard, state that modules should be able to pass 96 hours at maximum system voltage under damp heat conditions (85 C, 85% humidity) with less than 5% loss to their initial efficiency. The tandem cell technology tested at KAUST was shown to lose 53% of its initial performance after 22 hours under a 1,000 V negative bias, at a lower temperature of 60 C. Control samples were exposed the same temperature without the voltage bias, serving as evidence that PID was to blame for the loss. Full details of the study can be found in “Potential-induced degradation in perovskite/silicon tandem photovoltaic modules,” published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
After testing, the group took the cells apart and used imaging techniques to understand how the degradation had occurred. This showed that various materials from the perovskite layer had diffused into the encapsulant layer, suggesting that the voltage can change the perovskite’s structure and degrade its performance as a solar cell – meaning a distinct mechanism from the PID common to silicon, caused by sodium ions moving toward the cell.
In terms of mitigating this effect, the group sees encapsulant-free modules where the cell has no contact with the glass as one possibility, though noting that this would likely cause other problems given perovskites’ need to be shielded from moisture as well.
The testing also showed that applying voltage in the opposite direction could at least partially ‘heal’ the performance loss. The group, however, is certain that more protection will be needed. They state that searching for a material that can prevent diffusion of the perovskite materials without hurting cell performance in other ways could be a promising research direction.
