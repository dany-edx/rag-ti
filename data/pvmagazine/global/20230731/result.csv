Heliene, a Canadian solar module manufacturer, has ambitious plans to expand its U.S. manufacturing footprint by producing 1 GW of solar modules and 1.5 GW of cells in a new facility in Minnesota. The company currently has manufacturing operations producing 800 MW of modules in Minnesota and 300 MW in Ontario, Canada.
The privately held company plans to invest about $145 million in the new facility, driven by the additional production tax credit and domestic content adder available through the Inflation Reduction Act. The investment comes from Orion Infrastructure Capital (OIC), which contributed $5 million in equity to Heliene and $150 million in credit for the new facility.
The plan is for the new factory, which is expected to be in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area, to begin producing modules in 2024 and cells in 2025. Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene, told pv magazine USA that today the company is producing PERC modules, 80% of which are bifacial and 20% industrial rooftop large format. It plans to begin producing TOPcon modules by March 2024.
The new factory will be the company’s first to produce solar cells, and one of only a few that have announced plans to manufacture cells in the U.S. Pochtaruk noted getting cell production up and running requires the civil work to prepare the building, then the permitting process, which takes 6 months, then they’ll receive the equipment to start installation and testing…ultimately taking a total of 24 months. When asked how soon the company will ramp up to the 1.5 GW of cell production, Pochtaruk said that the company plans to start cells by July/August 2025, and it will take “a good 6 to 7 month to ramp up to 85% utilization”.
While the Inflation Reduction Act has a domestic content tax adder, pv magazine USA asked how much module content is currently sourced domestically. “Today we already have frames, encapsulant and back sheet, by December junction boxes and frame sealant. We still need ribbon and glass,” said Pochtaruk.
In October 2022 the company announced the opening of a 420 MW plant in Minnesota, adding to the company’s existing 150 MW operation in the state.

The cover plate, positioned independently of the fastener unit, transfers forces directly into the roof structure, allowing easy adaptation to surrounding tile contours without machinery.
“The appropriate place for fixing the roof hook can be marked with a slight pressure of the thumb,” said Aerocompact. “The pre-assembled hook is fastened with two thin sheet metal screws.”
Installers can mark the appropriate place for fixing the roof hook, fastened with two thin sheet metal screws, and then attach the carriage at different heights based on the roof batten height.
The system also includes colored cover plates in red, brown, or anthracite, reducing assembly time by up to 40%.
“There are countless different types of roof tiles on the European market,” said Albert Vonbun, a product manager for Aerocompact. “Until now, installers have had to cut them to size with an angle grinder for the PV mounting system to fit.”
Aerocompact said that the system has a patent-pending labyrinth-style seal, offering a permanent seal during installation without additional effort.
“Overall, we reduce assembly time by up to 40%,” said Vonbun.

The move is part of the government's plan to split Eskom into three separate entities: Generation, Transmission, and Distribution.
“This is a milestone decision by the dnergy fegulator and will immensely contribute to Eskom's unbundling trajectory,” said NERSA Chairperson Thembani Bukula.
The National Transmission Company of South Africa's independence ensures non-discriminatory access to the transmission system and responsibility for grid stability, with the authority to buy and sell power but not for profit, said NERSA.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the split of Eskom would improve funding and allocate responsibilities appropriately.
“We undertake these measures without delay to stabilize Eskom's finances, ensure electricity supply security, and establish the basis for long-term sustainability,” he said.
South Africa's National Treasury is crafting a bill to address Eskom's unsustainable ZAR 423 billion debt with a ZAR 254 billion debt relief arrangement. The bill proposes advances of ZAR 78 billion in 2023-24, ZAR 66 billion in 2024/25, and ZAR 40 billion in 2025-26, specifically designated to cover capital and interest payments.
Currently, Eskom remains the sole buyer of power generated under the country's Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPP).

The plant will be leased to the selected bidder for a period of up to 30 years, backed by a 15-year PPA with Kostt, the national market operator.
“The PPA shall be converted into a Contract for Difference (CfD) upon the confirmation of the Energy Regulatory Office (ERO) that a liquid functional day-ahead market has been established in the Republic of Kosovo,” said Kostt in the tender document.
Interested developers have until Aug. 15 to submit their bids.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Kosovo had 10 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2022. The country recently raised its renewable energy target to an additional 400 MW of capacity by 2026, which would be enough to satisfy one-quarter of its power demand.
Imports and two lignite-fired thermal power plants primarily supply most of Kosovo's electricity. The 40-year-old Kosovo A Power Station, located near Pristina, has a generation capacity of 345 MW, while the upgraded Kosovo B Power Station in Obilić, which is 27 years old, has a capacity of 540 MW.

Lunar regolith is made of dust, broken rocks, and other related materials and is present on the Moon, Mars, and Earth.
“Based on a process called molten regolith electrolysis, the breakthrough would bootstrap unlimited electricity and power transmission cables anywhere on the surface of the Moon,” Blue Origin said in a statement. “Today’s investment will result in a demonstration of autonomous operation in a simulated lunar environment by 2026.”
The technology of the company owned by Jeff Bezos consists of a scalable and contactless process for melting and moving molten regolith. It consists of a reactor that produces iron, silicon, and aluminum through molten regolith electrolysis via regolith simulants. The system uses electrical current to separate those elements from oxygen.
“Our proprietary transport subsystem moves and separates molten material at temperatures above 1600 C in a controlled and power-efficient manner while withstanding the high-temperature, corrosive environment,” Blue Origin said in a statement released in February. “Molten regolith electrolysis extracts iron, then silicon, and finally aluminum by passing a current through the molten regolith. The rising oxygen bubbles in one of our reactors show metals and metalloids being separated from oxygen. Our reactor geometry, metal extraction approach, and materials selection will enable sustained lunar operations.”
The company claims this process enables the production of silicon with a purity of 99.999%, as well as that of highly resistant solar glass by utilizing only molten regolith electrolysis byproducts.
“Blue Origin’s goal of producing solar power using only lunar resources is aligned with NASA’s highest priority Moon-to-Mars infrastructure development objective,” the company said.
The first research conducted by NASA for the development of solar cells from regolith dates back to 2005. This work provided a conceptual design for a solar-powered robotic rover able to build solar cells directly on the lunar surface.
“The lunar surface possesses both the elemental components needed for the fabrication of silicon solar cells and a vacuum environment that allow for vacuum deposition of thin film solar cells directly on the surface of the Moon without the need for vacuum chambers,” the paper reads.
The University of Houston built the first silicon and cadmium sulfide/cadmium telluride thin film photovoltaic diodes deposited on lunar regolith substrates in 2005. “The fabricated solar array is like a macroscopic version of an electronic device on a chip,” the scientists said. “The chip must be insulating so that the different elements can be made and then connected together in appropriate circuits.”
Estonia’s Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech) is currently also working on the development of solar cells from regolith. Last year, it unveiled a sandpaper-like solar cell relying on a monograin-powder technology. The device consists of thousands of small crystals, with a diameter of 50 micrometers, embedded into a polymer in one continuous layer.
“To complete the solar cell these microcrystals are coated with a buffer and window layers,” TalTech said in a statement. “In this way, each crystal works as a small individual solar cell and generates electricity.” It also said low-cost roll-to-roll techniques may be used to produce cells and panels.

Provaris Energy says the Tiwi H2 green hydrogen project is now on track to commence operations in 2027.
A recent report by engineering consultancy CE Partners progresses the concept design of the solar farm and transmission system to a 30% level, which provides the basis for optioneering and design optimization. Perth-based Provaris Energy said the report’s key findings show that the proposed 2,640-hectare solar precinct area on the Tiwi Islands, off the coast of the Northern Territory, has the capacity to support 2.6 GWp of solar.
It is expected that the solar farm, featuring a single-axis tracking system, will be capable of generating more than 5,000 GWh of clean energy per year. It would be delivered via a proposed four-circuit, 275 kV transmission line stretching 30 kilometers from the solar farm to the hydrogen production and export precincts.
Based on the generation forecasts, Provaris Energy has revised the expected peak green hydrogen production and export volume for the Tiwi H2 project to 90,000 tons per annum (tpa). The report includes a provisional allowance of about 10,000 tpa for planned optimisation processes, with the company to explore ways to reduce power losses and further evaluate equipment design and selection.
Provaris Executive Director and Chief Development Officer Garry Triglavcanin said the company is pleased with the work undertaken to date and said that securing land agreements with the relevant key Tiwi Island stakeholders will be a key next step.
“Once a satisfactory outcome has been achieved, FEED and further engineering studies are planned to drive the project toward financial close, targeted for the end of 2024,” he said. “With the support of key stakeholders, the project development program still allows for Provaris’ targeted first hydrogen production and export in late 2027.”
Provaris Energy said the environmental impact statement is now being prepared with submission planned for early 2024 while draft project and land agreements have already been submitted to the Tiwi Land Council. The company said it has already commenced discussions with potential joint venture partners for project development through to front-end engineering design (FEED) and a future final investment decision.
Green hydrogen produced at the Tiwi H2 Project facility is expected to be exported to the Asia-Pacific region, with a particular focus on Japan, South Korea, Singapore and China. The progress on the Tiwi H2 project follows a recent announcement stating that Provaris Energy will team with Norwegian company Prodtex to construct and test a prototype tank for the transport and storage of hydrogen.
Provaris Energy said it had awarded a contract to Prodtex to test a prototype tank for its proprietary compressed gas hydrogen carrier, H2NEO, and the floating storage solution, H2Leo. The two parties have also entered into an agreement to jointly develop a fully automated production and fabrication facility in Norway for the construction of compressed hydrogen tanks. The tank production facility aims to start operations mid-2025.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/31/photovoltaic-thermal-panel-based-on-reversed-circular-flow-jet-impingement/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MALAYSIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 31, 2023",Photovoltaic-thermal panel based on reversed circular flow jet impingement,"Researchers at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia have designed a bifacial photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) panel that utilizes circular jets impinging as a cooling medium.
“We have fabricated a prototype for lab-scale purposes,” the research's corresponding author, Adnan Ibrahim, told pv magazine. “However, the proposed cooling technique, called reversed circular flow jet impingement (RCFJI), could be implemented in real applications according to the module sizes used by the user.”
The system consists of a reversed circular flow cup placed at a distance of 25 mm below the back of a jet plate with 36 jet plate holes, each measuring 3 mm in diameter. The air enters the air inlet, circulates through the RCFJI cup, and leaves then the jet plate with high velocity, causing impinging effects on the bifacial module.
“The impinging effects enhance the heat transfer rate, thus cooling down the bifacial module temperature and enhancing the photovoltaic efficiency,” Ibrahim said. “In addition, the air outlet is converted into thermal energy.”
The reversed circular flow jet impingement was fabricated through a 3D printing process using polylactic acid filament, which the scientists said eased fabrication and cost. “The polylactic acid filament can withstand temperatures up to 110 C while the PVT collector does not exceed 60 C,” Ibrahim added.
The PV panel has a size of 698 mm x 619 mm and uses 12 monocrystalline solar cells with dimensions of 156 mm x 156 mm. It has a nominal power of 60 W, an open-circuit voltage of 22.12 V, and a short-circuit current of 3.71 A.
The researchers tested the PVT panel under different solar irradiance between 500 W/m2 and 900 W/m2. They found the collector achieved the highest photovoltaic exergy of 47.2 W at 900 W/m2, while the lowest of 28.1 W was reached at 500 W/m2. “Across the range of 500–900W/m2, the photovoltaic exergy values were determined to be between 24.88 and 27.18W, 29.45–32.34W, 33.89–37.40W, and 38.20–47.27W, respectively,” they explained.
They also observed that the panel's exergy efficiency reached a peak value of 12.64% when subjected to 900 W/m2, while the lowest exergy efficiency recorded was 12.25% under 500 W/m2. “In addition, the optimal operational mass flow rate was determined to be at 0.06 kg/s based on the exergy efficiency,” they added.
According to Ibrahim, the proposed PVT solar collector has a cost-benefit ratio of $0.33/m2/kWh with a payback period of 1.5 years for a single device with an annual energy gain (AEG) of 2465.70 kWh/year. “The RCFJI bifacial module has great potential to be adopted commercially, mainly for off-grid system purposes,” he stated. “It is best suited for solar applications in remote areas, rural areas, and agriculture. For instance, its thermal energy could be used for drying purposes.”
The group presented the system in the study “Exergy performance of a reversed circular flow jet impingement bifacial photovoltaic thermal (PVT) solar collector,” published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering.
Other researchers at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia recently developed a photovoltaic-thermal system based on PCM cooling, multi-level fin heat sinks for solar module cooling, and passive technology for solar module cooling based on fin heat sinks.

Enphase, a US-based supplier of solar microinverters, delivered lower-than-expected revenues for the second quarter of 2022. It also offered significantly lower-than-expected guidance for revenues next quarter, posting an expectation of $550 million to $600 million, dramatically lower than the consensus forecast of $748 million. Following the earnings report, share prices dipped about 10%.
The California-based manufacturer has hit some choppy waters in the macro environment, as rising interest rates and stabilizing electricity prices have lowered demand for residential solar in the United States. While the company has posted strong sequential growth in Europe, slowing US sales are expected to persist into next year, pulling down revenues.
US residential solar is further being hampered by policy changes, particularly around reductions in compensation for net energy metering. California notably entered NEM 3.0 in April, and other states have followed suit.
ROTH Capital Partners Managing Director Phil Shen warned in an industry note that in addition to slowed demand, the emergence of Tesla as a residential string inverter provider may pose risk to Enphase’s market share. While Shen notes that Enphase is a superior product with a better value for total cost of ownership, customers and installers alike may be more attracted to a lower cash ticket price for the string inverters provided by Tesla. ROTH estimates that 20% to 30% of US residential solar market share may go to Tesla.
Enphase posted second-quarter revenues of $711 million, falling short of the consensus $722 million. It delivered 2.1 GW (DC) of microinverters and 82 MWh of energy storage. Earnings per share reached $1.47, coming in above the consensus of $1.25. ROTH lowered its 12-month price target from $250 to $185 and maintained its buy rating. The stock stands at $150 per share at time of writing.
The company also authorized a $1 billion stock repurchase program, a common tactic for businesses that may be looking to stem a declining share price and believe their company is undervalued in the market.
As demand for US-made components has increased under the regulatory environment created by the Inflation Reduction Act, Enphase has begun making contract manufacturing partnerships. Contract manufacturer Flex is producing IQ8 microinverters in Columbia, South Carolina.
It recently was visited by President Joe Biden to commemorate the launch of the site. It also began a new contract manufacturing operation with Foxconn in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin. The two facilities shipped about 50,000 microinverters in the second quarter. Enphase said it is on track to begin shipments from a third contract manufacturer in the third quarter of 2023.
Enphase's US manufacturing footprint will total $60 million in capital investment, create 1,800 direct jobs, and produce 18 million microinverters per year.

“We are bringing our experience and best practices for PV business from Europe to the US market,” Reinaldo Cozzo, PV Business Development Manager, told pv magazine. “The DC combiner boxes bring greater reliability and the possibility to monitor the condition of each string, which is not common yet in the US.”
The rated voltage is 1500 V with up to 32 inputs and includes built-in short-circuit and overvoltage protection. The combiner boxes are suitable for tracker and fix tilt installations, supporting inverters from leading inverter manufacturers.
The PV DC Combiner Box for High Power Panels products are designed for plants equipped with bifacial and half-cell products from well-known PV module brands.
Weidmüller offers its combiner boxes with optional string monitoring. String monitoring tracks string parameters, such as current and voltage of individual strings, surge protection device status, temperature, and breaker status. The monitoring version measures up to 50 Amp per string. It is powered by PV plant current and has low heat emission, according to the company.
The US unit of Germany-based Weidmüller anticipates that the North American market will use monitoring as has been the case in its other markets in Europe and Latin America.
“We foresee that monitoring PV assets, and leveraging the associated data to streamline operations, and increase profitability will be the next logical step for the US market,” Pete Tecos, Head of Global Key Account Management, Weidmüller told pv magazine.

Even in non-traditional orientations, solar panels can provide a cost-effective and environmentally friendly energy solution when strategically installed. This principle is currently being showcased by Spring Hill Greens, a Colorado-based farming operation nestled between two greenhouses. Their unique vertical bifacial solar panel system optimizes land use while potentially capitalizing on the high albedo effect of the highly reflective greenhouse materials.

The system’s design and installation were handled by Sandbox Solar. While they don’t yet have a tool to fully measure the albedo effect without a control vertical system, the company has commenced experiments to provide further insights into generation curves. Ian Skor, owner of Sandbox Solar, noted that production on snowy days is dramatically higher than any other installation. The project’s peak generation periods are at 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., which Skor likened to a “reverse duck curve.”
To help design and simulate the generation curves of the facility prior to construction, Sandbox Solar employed their in-house software, SPADE Agrivoltaic.
Preliminary data shows promising results. During the months of September through April,  the vertical bifacial system produced 559.28 kWh/kWp. This performance surpasses that of a nearby east-west rooftop system owned by Spring Hill by 14%, which produced 489.93 kWh/kWp. However, it falls behind a south-facing ground mount project, also a Spring Hill property, which achieved an output of 857 kWh/kWp, by 34%.

Denver-based Greentech Renewable provided the hardware for the project, which includes Canadian Solar 445 W BiHiKu bifacial solar modules, SolarEdge 11.4  240V single-phase inverters, p505 rail mounted optimizers, and Tamarack bifacial vertical solar fence racking.
“My summary is that the system saves dramatically on footprint and can increase the number of usable project areas,” said Skor, acknowledging the customer’s initial desire to maximize land use. “The production during snowy days is dramatically higher than any other installation. This application may work extremely well in northern climates that experience significant snowfall.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/31/laser-optimization-for-half-cut-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA",MARK HUTCHINS,"JULY 31, 2023",Laser optimization for half-cut solar cells,"Virtually all modules on the market today feature cells that have been cut into two or more pieces. Using cut cells results in a lower current, reducing power loss at the module level. Half-cell modules typically produce 3-5% more power than full-cell equivalents.
But the cutting process itself can result in the loss of some of this power – typically when damage at the cell’s cut edge causes cracks to form and spread when the module is put under various forms of pressure in the field.
Optimized cutting processes have been developed to greatly reduce damage at the cell edges, and additional processes to repair the break in cell layers caused by cutting are also being brought to the market this year. Many manufacturers though continue to rely on lower cost ‘scribe and break’ processes that typically leave some damage at the edge of a cell.
A group of scientists led by Korea University looked at ways to minimize performance loss in modules using laser scribing and mechanical cleaving (LSMC) and break-cut cells. Both changes to the parameters of the laser process and additions to the module design were investigated as part of the study.
The group tested five different sets of laser parameters, varying the power, frequency and pulse length. The strength of the cut cells was then tested via four-point bending. Setting the laser to low power (30 W), short pulse duration (10 nanoseconds), and high frequency (600 kilohertz), produced the best result.
Cells cut under different parameters were also observed under a microscope to spot cracks forming, and processed into modules for further testing. After mechanical load testing, the same set of laser parameters was shown to produce the best performing module – which lost 5% of its performance compared to 6.63% for cells cut under reference conditions.
Further module testing also demonstrated that working with a thicker encapsulant, or adding a support rail to the rear of the module, could further reduce the propagation of cracks in the cells and associated power loss – though the study did not cover the implications of these on cost or other aspects of the module.
The experiments are described in full in the paper “Reliability study on the half-cutting PERC solar cell and module,” published in Energy Reports. “This study can contribute to improving the reliability, such as energy yield on the large size wafers product such as M10 or M12 because those wafers have more length to cut than M2 size in this study.” The group says it now plans further studies on the larger format cells in use today.

In solar, ANIL says it plans full backward integration, from silicon to modules.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/31/new-guidelines-for-albedo-measurements-aim-to-reduce-uncertainties-in-bifacial-pv-yield-estimates/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE",VALERIE THOMPSON,"JULY 31, 2023",New guidelines for albedo measurements aim to reduce uncertainties in bifacial PV yield estimates,"Researchers from the Polytechnic University of Madrid and Qualifying Photovoltaics, a Madrid-based PV engineering consultancy, have provided a series of practical recommendations for short-term ground-based albedo measurements that can be used to reduce uncertainty in utility scale bifacial PV plant yield estimates.
“As bifacial PV modules will soon dominate the market, our research is very relevant to the industry, “Pablo Merodio, the paper’s corresponding author, told pv magazine. “The albedo is a key input parameter for bifacial PV energy yield estimations, but best practices are not yet completely defined, and proper procedures for albedo measurement are still under debate.”
In the study “Albedo measurements and energy yield estimation uncertainty for bifacial photovoltaic systems,” published in Progress in Photovoltaics, the researchers analyzed the albedo sensitivity coefficient relating to albedo measurement and subsequent energy yield estimate uncertainties.
They performed simulation exercises for three different sites in Chile, Spain and Sweden, each with static and single-axis tracker in 1P and 2P configurations. They proposed a formula for the albedo sensitivity coefficient that accounts for the impact of the ground coverage ratio (CGR), which is the ratio of the PV system area to the total ground area, and the inverter loading ratio (ILR), which is the ratio of installed DC capacity to the inverter's AC power rating.
In addition, experiments to evaluate the uncertainty associated with different albedo measurement conditions were carried out. They measured the surface reflectance of five different ground surfaces using four sensors, which provided three useful types of albedos that are defined and described in the paper.
“We proposed in-field albedo measurement recommendations and best practices that are both flexible and lower cost, yet they lead to a maximum albedo uncertainty component of 1.5%,” said Merodio.
Reference cell setups may be used to lower the instrumentation costs. Furthermore, combining a reference cell with a pyranometer also provides convenient angular and spectral corrections. “Otherwise, because PV modules are angular and spectrally sensitive, the rear irradiance needs to be adjusted for angle of incidence and spectral mismatch losses in bifacial PV performance simulations,” said Merodio.
The team acknowledges that there are other aspects of albedo uncertainty to consider, as “the most relevant uncertainty source might in fact be associated with the non-homogeneity” of future PV plants’ surface. “An important consideration is that changes in the use of land caused by the construction of a PV plant lead to an albedo uncertainty that might predominate over all the uncertainty sources associated to the albedo measurement conditions. This can also be the case for long-term seasonal variations, which can become the dominant uncertainty source for high latitude locations,” they noted.
When asked about the results processing, Merodio told pv magazine that they used SISIFO, a PV performance simulation tool that is available in both a free and premium version. “SISIFO takes advantage of the results of all our research studies to reduce energy yield estimations uncertainty for PV systems. We used it in our paper to determine the impact of albedo measurements uncertainty on yield estimates,” said Merodio.
The group hopes its research may lay the ground for future standards, although they are not directly involved in standard setting at the moment. “One of the main objectives of our research article was to provide guidance for future albedo measurement standards and best practices,” said Merodio. He added that the research group is currently working on new methods to characterize bifacial PV modules with low uncertainty.
