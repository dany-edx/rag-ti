The monocrystalline wafer manufacturer told workers about temporary layoffs this week, but it has not said how many people will be affected by the decision.
“We can only register that the price drop and the build-up of modules in stock are creating major challenges for European players in solar energy,” said NorSun Managing Director Erik Løkke-Øwre, noting that the situation is affecting the entire value chain. “The market is flooded with low-cost modules that no one in Europe can compete with.”
In the meantime, the company will continue to concentrate on its short-term and long-term expansion plans, including plans to upgrade its production line in Årdal.
NorSun recently raised new capital for expansion. It was also selected for €53 million ($56.8 million) of funding from the European Union Innovation Fund.

The study, titled “The potential role of a hydrogen network in Europe,” indicates that the hydrogen network, which can use existing gas pipelines, consistently reduces system costs. While power grid expansion achieves savings, the most significant cost reductions are achieved when both networks are expanded together.
Lhyfe and VSB Energies Nouvelles have signed a 16-year electricity supply contract. Under this agreement, Lhyfe Bretagne will receive 100% of the green electricity generated by VSB Energies Nouvelles' Buléon wind farm. The green hydrogen produced at the Buléon site will serve local mobility and industrial processes. The hydrogen production facility, with a capacity of 5 MW, is expected to be operational by late 2023.
Nortegas has successfully completed the third phase of tests for its H2SAREA project. During this phase, a mixture of 15% hydrogen and 85% natural gas was injected into a scaled replica of the company's distribution networks. This achievement demonstrates the technical feasibility of blending hydrogen and natural gas, paving the way for its short-term use. Nortegas aims to complete 20% blending tests before the end of 2023.
Germany's Oldenburg Trade Supervisory Office has granted approval for the construction and operation of two 100 MW electrolysers at RWE‘s Emsland natural gas power plant in Lingen. The 200 MW plant, the first of its size in Germany, can produce up to 35,000 metric tons of green hydrogen annually. RWE plans to establish hydrogen production capacities of 300 MW by 2027 and will commission a 14 MW pilot plant in Lingen by the end of 2023.
Thyssenkrupp nucera shares have been added to the SDAX selection index, which consists of the 70 largest and most liquid companies below the MDAX. With thyssenkrupp AG holding 50.2% of the shares, De Nora owning 25.9%, and Energy Solutions Company holding approximately 6%, thyssenkrupp nucera's free float is around 18%.
Plastic Omnium says it plans to construct North America's largest hydrogen storage manufacturing plant in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan. This $170 million investment aims to supply a major American automaker with high-pressure hydrogen vessels for medium and heavy-duty zero-emissions mobility. The facility, with an annual production capacity of up to 100,000 hydrogen vessels, is expected to be commissioned by the end of 2026 with the goal of achieving 100% carbon neutrality.

Around 56 solar projects with a total capacity of 1,927.68 MW secured 15-year CfDs at a final price of GBP 47 (€58.64)/MWh. The auction also awarded 1,480.74 MW of onshore wind capacity and 223.6 MW of remote island wind at GBP 52.29/MWh, with a total of 29 wind projects securing contracts. Notably, this marked the first time that solar capacity surpassed wind in a UK auction.
Several companies – including Sonnedix, RWE, Opdenergy, and Lightsource – won contracts for solar projects, with the largest one being 57 MW. These arrays will need to connect to the grid between 2025 and 2028. During the previous auction in July 2022, 2.2 GW of solar capacity was allocated at $55/MWh.
Under the CfD bidding rules, clean power generators participate in auctions to determine a strike price that defines their income from selling electricity. When market prices fall below the strike price, the government covers the difference, while generators retain the surplus when market prices exceed the strike price, later reimbursing the excess to the government.

The completion of the Huasun Dali 2.5 GW Phase I HJT Cell Project, along with the successful production of the first batch of 210 mm HJT solar cells, occurred on Sept. 6.
“Thanks to the double-sided micro-crystalline process and silver-copper paste technology, the HJT solar cells can performance exceptionally well even in harsh environments such as high altitude and high ultraviolet rays,” said Huasun.
In March, the China-based heterojunction module manufacturer started making solar panels at its HJT cell factory in Xuancheng, in China's Anhui province. The factory will have an annual capacity of 2.4 GW and will exclusively produce bifacial 182 mm HJT cells, based on a cell tech with a power conversion efficiency of 25.26%. The results have been confirmed by the Institute for Solar Energy Research, in Hamelin, Germany.

Australia offers a unique case study because it has highest installation rate of rooftop PV, with more than 3 million solar homes, and a growing distributed BESS fleet.
Distributed PV and battery inverters in Australia are required to exhibit voltage-responsive power-quality response modes to prevent excessive voltage rises caused by increasing day-time energy exports, but these modes can curtail power output and limit the value that can be gained from these assets. Now for the first time, UNSW researchers have studied all inverter power-quality response modes and have developed novel algorithms to assess curtailment.
They worked on a sample of 1,300 households in South Australia, which is seeing the highest uptake of rooftop solar in the world with over 40% distributed PV penetration. Their study compared the experienced curtailment between distributed-PV only sites and distributed-PV coupled with battery sites.
Their results showed that average curtailment loss was 1.5% for distributed PV sites and 0.2% for distributed PV coupled with battery sites. However, some sites were heavily affected, losing up to 25% of generation, they found.
The researchers identified the reasons for the larger curtailment loss as wiring and network connection faults and high voltage set-points at households' respective local substations.
“Other potential reason for the heavily impacted sites is being located towards the end of the low voltage feeder, however this couldn't be verified due to lack of spatial data,” said the researchers.
They noted that the large variation in curtailed generation across sites raises concerns for system owners and suggested further inquiry into the power-quality response mode design and regulations.
Their study also examined inverter conformance using real-world operational data for all three power quality response modes, and found a low rate of conformance according to the Australian Standards. According to the researchers, there were “various discrepancies in the execution of these modes which raises concerns considering the increasing importance of distributed-PV and battery inverter fleet in supporting network operations and security.”
“The results therefore warrant further investigation into the reasons behind these discrepancies and devising appropriate mechanisms to tighten inverter conformance checks,” the researchers said, calling on distribution system operators and inverter manufacturers to take action.
Undertaking network expenditure to regulate low-voltage grids to reduce curtailment is a possible pathway moving forward, the researchers argued. However, this may be an expensive option.
They said that other solutions could include implementing dynamic network pricing, dynamic operating envelopes, and dynamic export limits to use the hosting capacity of networks more effectively.
The researchers discussed their findings in “Real-world data analysis of distributed PV and battery energy storage system curtailment in low voltage networks,” which was recently published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.

The researchers have proposed a new energy system consisting of a PV array, an electric heat pump for space heating and cooling., and two different storage systems for heat (TES) and electricity (EES).
“We are preparing an extension of this research taking into account the opportunity of using photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) instead of PV solar collectors, in such a way as to satisfy a part of domestic heating and domestic hot water production,” Prof. Antonio Gaglianom told pv magazine.
The Italian group said that their proposed configuration significantly reduces the required battery capacity by 10 kWh or more, resulting in numerous financial and environmental advantages. They noted that surplus energy from the PV plant can be used for EES charging or activating the HP for TES charging.
The scientists conducted a simulation of the system through the TRNSYS software using a reference building in Catania. The system is assumed to rely on an electric heat pump with a thermal maximum power of 9.5 kW, a radiant floor system, and a 4.8 kW PV system using 300 W panels with an efficiency of 18.4%. Their modeling also considered solar radiation, wind speed, electrical load, electricity prices, and price- and incentive-based DR programs
“The total electricity demand is 10,828 kWh/year, which means 77.3 kWh/m2 (square meter of floor), while the electricity production from PV is 8,855 kWh/year,” they said, noting that around 34.1% of the generated solar power is self-consumed. “Therefore, due to lack of available space for the installation of the PV plant, the demand coverage factor is 81.8%.”
They said that the system could achieve self-consumption and self-sufficiency rates of about 80% if linked to a thermal storage system and a 5 kWh electrical storage system. This high percentage is three times higher than that one achievable by an energy system without storage, according to the researchers.
“It allows for reduction of the emission of at least 1,300 kg CO2 equivalent, while the requested lower capacity of the electrical storage diminishes the installation costs, of about €10,000 ($10.700), which compensate for the extra costs for the installation of the thermal storage, of about €1,500.”
The scientists introduced the system in “Improvement of energy self-sufficiency in residential buildings by using solar-assisted heat pumps and thermal and electrical storage,” which was recently published in Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments.
“In the future works, the modeling of charging stations and parking lots of electric vehicles for charging and discharging and exchanging with the network will be discussed,” they said. “In addition, it is possible to examine the discussion of reliability in the network.”

The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for Mono PERC modules from China, and TOPCon module prices plummeted for the first time in five weeks to $0.151/W and $0.157/W respectively this week.

 
The more than 7% plummet in both CMM and TOPCon prices comes as many sellers fight for market share. There are “more kids on the block who want to get their products sold and can pretty much only compete on price” with major tier-1 module makers, a solar market veteran explained.
One such major manufacturer could offer prices as low as $0.150/W for Mono PERC modules if cash is paid in advance, a source there said, while TOPCon prices as low as $0.153/W – to the disbelief of some – were reported during OPIS’ weekly market survey. Even at these low price levels, developers are not buying as they expect prices to fall even further and will only enter the market then, the source added.
“We are now entering an interesting period” shaped by, among other factors, “high inventory levels abroad,” according to an experienced market observer. Module suppliers in Europe are facing a heavy inventory burden, so much so that this is a “red sea market,” a source at a leading module manufacturer said.
Weakness is evident in other export markets, too. In Southeast Asia, a module seller at Bangkok’s ASEAN Sustainable Energy Week (ASEW) told OPIS that it saw very limited sales on the event’s first day, which is usually when transactions peak. Even as module prices dive, EPCs still face a “red ocean” as module costs still constitute 50% of a solar project’s total cost, a Thai EPC also told OPIS at ASEW. Over in Latin America, the lowest price quoted for Mono PERC modules at Brazil’s Intersolar South America was $0.130/W, a source said.
Looking ahead, the market speaks of prices gaining in the short term on the back of increasing costs for different module components. Soda ash prices, used to make photovoltaic glass, have gained significantly, noted one source, while another said the same of Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA), used as the encapsulant for modules.
More broadly, however, overcapacity concerns continue to loom on the horizon and could pull prices back down eventually. “Remember, 1 CNY/W before year-end,” a market veteran warned.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

The company said the new MOSFET may help inverter manufacturers in reducing the size and weight of their products.
“The higher frequency operation enables downsizing and weight reduction of other system components, such as heat sinks and filters,” said the company.
The new product hosts a 2,200 V Schottky barrier diode (SBD) and is intended for use in two-level inverters in 1,500 V (DC) voltage systems. Two-level devices have fewer switching modules than three-level inverters, which results in smaller and lighter systems, according to the manufacturer.
The SiC modules reportedly operate with low conduction loss and low drain-source on-voltage. They also have lower turn-on and turn-off switching losses of 14mJ and 11mJ, respectively. They purportedly have low stray inductance, low thermal resistance, and a built-in thermistor.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie have released a solar market insight report with new data from the first half of 2023. They have found that US solar developers installed 5.6 GW in the second quarter of 2023, up 20% from the second quarter of 2022. The US market also added nearly 12 GW in the first six months of the year.
In the second quarter of 2023, residential solar installations hit a record high of 1.8 GW, driven by Californians eager to lock in favorable export compensation rates during the transition from NEM 2.0 to NEM 3.0 in April. Wood Mackenzie says it expects this installation surge to persist into the third quarter, before gradually declining in the fourth quarter.
Commercial solar developers added 345 MW in the second quarter, down 9% year on year. However, the total number of installed projects increased by 7%, which points to relatively stable volumes for the segment, according to Wood Mackenzie. 
The community solar segment added 226 MW in the second quarter of 2023, with no growth from the preceding quarter and marking a 16% decline from the second quarter of 2022. The report notes that while there is momentum in the sector, growth is hampered by challenges related to interconnection, market penetration, siting, and permitting.
Utility-scale solar developers led in terms of capacity additions, with 3.3 GW in the second quarter of 2023, up 22% year on year. The segment has rebounded this year from supply chain constraints that caused project delays and cancellations. Wood Mackenzie predicts a total of 172 GW (DC) in new utility-scale installations between 2023 and 2028. Across all sectors, it says that it anticipates 52% year-on-year growth in installations, from a 13% decline in 2022.

Under new ownership, SunCable plans to flood Darwin with about 4 GW of solar energy. It is also looking to move forward with its projects, including subsea cables between Darwin and Singapore, but at a significantly more modest scale, at least initially.
SunCable said in a statement that its ambition is to now supply just 6 GW of firmed renewable energy in multiple stages, beginning with “at least” 900 MW of green power to Darwin and 1.75 GW to Singapore.
To realize this, the company will be split into a domestic Australian division, to be overseen by Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners, an Australian investment company that holds a stake in the project. 
SunCable's international division, meanwhile, will continue to work on the Australia-Asia Power Link (AAPowerLink) proposal to build a high-voltage (HV) subsea cable between Darwin and Singapore. It will file its submission to the Singaporean Energy Market Authority to secure an energy import conditional licence later this month.
If SunCable is able to deliver this first stage, it will move forward with its original mega-project proposal to build up to 20 GW of solar near Powell Creek, in Australia's Northern Territory.

Spain and the UK saw irradiance up by more than 10% due to a concentration of the jetstream towards Scandinavia, Central Europe and the Baltics, which received just 80% of average August irradiance according to data collected by Solcast, a DNV company, via the Solcast API.
The UK saw on average 110% of normal August irradiance, with values exceeding this in the north. Spain and Portugal received 10-20% more than normal, due to reduced cloud. The jetstream normally brings broad cloud cover across the continent, blanketing Europe from Spain, to the UK and extending south to Greece at this time of year. This August, the jetstream has been more concentrated, steering weather through the narrow gap between the UK and Spain, and pushing weather through to the rest of the continent, resulting in the irradiance pattern seen in the map below. Spain also saw other extreme conditions with wildfires throughout the month, and heavy rainfall associated with storm activity at the end of the month. Despite the devastating and tragic effects of both these events, they did not depress irradiance following the clear start to the month.

Most of Scandinavia recorded just 80% of average August irradiance, with central Europe seeing only 90% from France to Poland. In addition to the normal jetstream cloud effects, these regions were impacted early in the month by cloud cover associated with Storm Hans. This storm was the second unusually intense summer storm seen in the region, following Storm Poly in July, and it’s possible these storms are being intensified by the concentrated nature of the jetstream pattern this year. The impacts from this storm were significant, with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) declaring the rain in Germany a 400-year event, and railway infrastructure being impacted in a derailment in Denmark and a railway bridge collapse in Norway.

Spain typically leads August irradiance in Europe, so the effects of increased sunshine this year provide a stark contrast to the rest of the continent in the average irradiance map above. The Iberian Peninsula averaged more than 7 kWh/m2 across the month, despite the impacts of aerosols from the wildfires and the rain activity at the end of the month.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.
