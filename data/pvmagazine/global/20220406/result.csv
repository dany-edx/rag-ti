The German government has introduced its so-called EEG Easter package to facilitate faster expansion of photovoltaics and wind power.
The new provisions identify new areas for the deployment of PV and support the participation of municipalities in existing solar and wind parks. In addition, the government wants to streamline the planning and approval procedures and push ahead with grid expansion. Renewables will prioritized in a future version of Germany's renewable energy law, the EEG.
In line with the higher expansion targets, the capacity to be allocated in the tenders for photovoltaics and wind power will be expanded significantly. The aim is to raise the expansion of PV to a level of 22GW by 2023 and then to keep it stable in the years that follow. This could lead to a cumulative installed PV capacity of 215GW in Germany by 2030, divided as evenly as possible between rooftops and open spaces.
Federal Economics Minister Robert Habeck (Greens) said at the beginning of the year that the EEG Easter package would also contain a booster for PV projects. And the draft has a large number of individual measures for solar. First and foremost, in the future there will be “adequate funding” for new rooftop systems that feed their entire solar power into the grid.
“The new remuneration rates should be applicable early in the course of 2022, subject to their approval under state aid law, in order to avoid interim alerts,” a government source said.
Accordingly, the degression of the feed-in tariff should also be suspended until the beginning of 2024. After that, a six-month degression is planned. Currently, the feed-in tariffs are being cut each quarter depending on the installed capacity of the previous quarter.
In addition, the EEG draft provides for the area for solar parks to be “moderately expanded, taking into account agricultural and nature conservation aspects.” This also relates to agrivoltaic and floating projects. But there should be a bonus for PV linked to agricultural or farming activities due to higher costs. The Easter package also states that community solar parks up to 6MW can be built in the future without participating in tenders.
“The Easter package is the accelerator for the expansion of renewable energy,” said Habeck after the cabinet decision. “We will almost double the share of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption within less than a decade. We are tripling the speed of renewable expansion – on water, on land and on the roof.”
He said that he sees the Easter package as the basis for Germany’s energy security, energy sovereignty and climate neutrality.
“The Easter package is part of our agenda and has been worked out under high pressure in recent months. In view of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, which violates international law, it has now taken on a double priority,” said Halbeck.

Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from the atmosphere and emits more. As a result, the surface loses heat to the outer space and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
“Such radiative cooling effect has received significant recent interest, focusing on achieving cooling in various materials and on integration in energy-related applications, such as building cooling,” the scientist explained, noting that this flow may be used for power generation at night.
The solar cell is based on a thermoelectric generator (TEG) module that extracts power from the radiative cooler at night and extra daytime power from excess heating coming from the cell itself.
“What we managed to do here is build the whole thing from off-the-shelf components, have a very good thermal contact, and the most expensive thing in the whole setup was the thermoelectric itself,” said researcher Zunaid Omair.
The device achieved 50 mW/m2 of power generation with a clear night sky and an open-circuit voltage of 100mV, which the scientists described as significantly higher than the values achieved in previous demonstration.
“The nighttime power generation is around 10–100 mW/m2 depending on location and sky condition,” they said. “Our approach can provide nighttime standby lighting and power in off-grid and mini-grid applications, where PV cell installations are gaining popularity.”
They described their findings in “Nighttime electric power generation at a density of 50 mW/m2 via radiative cooling of a photovoltaic cell,” which was recently published in Applied Physics Letters. Radiative cooling has been applied to solar panel cooling by researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, the Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/06/new-report-calls-for-collective-action-to-address-forced-labor-risks-in-the-pv-value-chain/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"APRIL 6, 2022",New report calls for collective action to address forced labor risks in the PV value-chain,"“Energy security now has a different level of significance and priority… renewable energy not only contributes to energy security and energy supplies, but it also frees us from dependence. Renewable energy is the energy of freedom,” Lindner said.
But as the drive for increased capacity in solar energy takes on new urgency, the sector risks being perceived not as ‘the energy of freedom’, but rather as a driver of forced labor.
Our new research report, ‘The Energy of Freedom’? Solar energy, modern slavery and the Just Transition, seeks practical solutions. We set out a new method of estimating the risk of forced labor in the on-grid PV production system of individual countries, and propose a roadmap for international collaboration to address those risks.
We also address risks of supply-chain fragmentation arising from emerging regulatory requirements relating to forced labor risks. These include the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in the US and the EU’s consideration of a forced labor legal instrument.
Given the global nature of the value chain, single-country and single-region solutions risk producing fragmentation. The problem is that this may raise costs and roll-out times, and reduce innovation, without necessarily addressing existing forced labor risks.
As we explore in the report, the solution to supply-chain bifurcation is collective action to transform the value chain so that forced labor risks are minimized in the first place. This is likely to involve industry stakeholders working together to develop a global ‘roadmap’ for both remediation of existing forced labor risks and development of new, forced-labor-free production capacity.
Industry players will be familiar with the issues. Around 40% of the global supply of polysilicon comes from Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where some of it is suspected of being made with state-sponsored forced labor. And between 15 and 30% of the cobalt in lithium-ion batteries used to store solar energy comes from informal mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Forced and child labor are common. Forced labor risks can also arise in other contexts.
The presence of forced labor in these supply chains poses growing risks not only to workers but also to importers and investors.
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, passed in the United States in December 2021, will prevent the import of goods made with Uyghur forced labor from June 2022. Already, US Customs and Border Protection has detained millions of dollars of PV products under the Tariff Act of 1930.
The European Commission is also preparing a new legal instrument to ban the sale of goods made with forced labor in the European single market.
Solar energy stakeholders have called for more clarity on how value chains will deal with these risks. Markets are looking for clarity on how manufacturers will undertake effective supply chain due diligence and remediation.
Investors are looking for buyers to set out transparent timelines for disengagement from suppliers tainted by forced labor. Some development finance institutions and multilateral development banks have begun working to develop common approaches to these risks, which will see them stop financing projects and withdraw from relationships that exceed defined forced labor risk thresholds, or where suppliers or clients fail to take required remedial actions within defined periods.
But some of these changes are having unintended consequences.
Our newly published, peer-reviewed research from the University of Nottingham’s Rights Lab – funded by the British Academy, one of the UK’s leading research funding bodies – reports that a new focus on ‘re-shoring’ PV supply-chains risks splitting the global market. One set of supply chains may provide ‘forced labor-free' solar products to clients who want them, while another set provides forced labor-made goods to other clients. That split may not only do little to help people forced to labor to make polysilicon and mine cobalt but could also raise costs, reduce innovation, and slow decarbonization.
So what practical solutions are available to the industry to address these risks, and how can our research help?
Our report sets out a new way of estimating the forced labor risk in the on-grid PV energy a country produces, accounting for all the forced labor risks earlier in the value chain. These risks can be calculated per kWh or per USD LCOE.
The method uses export-import data, the latest available PV lifecycle and LCOE information, and data on the risk involved in producing the different inputs into the PV energy production system. It provides detailed insights into the nature, size, and source of forced labor risks in country-level PV, and on-grid production systems. The data comes from a combination of sources: the UN (UN COMTRADE), the International Renewable Energy Agency, World Bank, and PSILCA, which provides forced labor risk metrics that draw on the US Department of State, US Department of Labor, and Global Slavery Index data.
The purpose of this new method is not to rank countries, but rather to provide a method for identifying how and where forced labor risk arises in the different inputs that feed into PV energy production. These risks cascade down the value chain affecting subsequent buyers and end-users. The method also allows tracing of how changes in the forced labor risk associated with specific inputs, such as polysilicon or cobalt from specific sources, cascade through the value chain to different buyers and production systems. This allows users to connect procurement, investment, and planning decisions to defined risk parameters.
Our findings apply the method to national-level data. The best such available data comes from 2018 and 2022. We provide interactive country profile visualizations which allow the user to control risk settings for ‘frequency of forced labor’, giving them the ability to see how different perceptions of risk cascade through the value chain. We provide these for the top 30 on-grid PV-producing countries.
The analysis applies only to embodied risk. We do not seek to assess how companies are responding to or mitigating these risks. With the right input data, however, the method could be adapted to firm-level inventories, allowing inter-firm and project-level comparison, which may prove useful for developers and investors.
Our report argues that a global roadmap for transitioning the industry to a forced labor-free footing is urgently needed. Manufacturers and developers, buyers, investors, governments, and civil society should come together to address forced labor risks by acting along the value chain.
Stakeholders should agree on plans, incentives, and timelines to move the industry towards a model that addresses the social externalities generated by solar energy production, storage, and use. These incentives could include sustainability-linked finance, market access, or tax credits.
Investors and lenders may have an important ‘stewardship’ role to play in driving change across the PV ecosystem. They could work together with developers, manufacturers, and major buyers to agree to transitional arrangements for the path towards zero forced labor risk in solar energy value chains. Transitional arrangements could accelerate progress by linking product and capital costs to forced labor risk metrics.
Industry associations also have a key role to play. But if they do not step up to develop such a roadmap, government-based forums in which such a discussion might be convened include the International Solar Alliance, the OECD, and the US-EU Trade and Technology Council.
Such an approach would create greater certainty for developers, investors, and consumers, and help create efficiency by allocating costs to those that are the highest sources of risk in the system. In the current arrangement, firms that tolerate forced labor are allowed to undercut those who respect human rights.
A transitional roadmap will be critical to ensure the solar industry is indeed regarded in future not as a source of forced labor risk, but as ‘the energy of freedom’. It is time to act.

Boviet Solar, a Vietnam-based solar PV manufacturer based in San Jose, California, has announced plans to rebrand its solar modules, in addition to three new R&D initiatives.
The company is known for producing monocrystalline PERC PV cells and monofacial and bifacial modules. It is now working on several R&D projects, in collaboration with three universities in Vietnam and one university in China.
It is working on a new N-TOPCon cell technology, which it claims is more efficient and stable. It is also working on a second R&D project to integrate N-TOPCon cells into 600W+ modules. The modules will feature advanced casing and will benefit from a low temperature coefficient, low attenuation, and higher double-sided ratios, said Boviet.
In addition, Boviet Solar  is targeting heterojunction (HJT) cell technology. It said it expects HJT to become the next-generation mainstream technology, with an efficiency rating of 27.5%.
New name
Separately, Boviet Solar has renamed its modules after stars. The monofacial modules are now called the “Gamma Series,” while the bifacial modules are called the “Vega Series.”
“We think Vega and Gamma are the perfect images for our highly efficient mono- monofacial and bifacial PV modules with their industry leading power output. Furthermore, star names make sense because our own Sun is of course a star – a star that makes solar energy possible here on Earth,” said Sienna Cen, president of Boviet Solar USA.
Boviet is not the only company switching to TOPCon. The world’s major solar manufacturers can be expected to switch from industry-standard PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) products to tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology “within the next few years,” according to one US analyst.
The technological shift prompted by manufacturers nearing PERC’s conversion efficiency threshold of 23.7% – for commercially produced products – is one of the predictions made by Denver-based Clean Energy Associates (CEA) in its survey of the solar manufacturing industry during the last three months of 2021.

The solar industry is on the precipice of an unprecedented disruption, as the US Department of Commerce continues to investigate whether solar cell and module manufacturers in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam have been using parts produced by Chinese companies. Doing so would mean that they are circumventing existing antidumping and countervailing (AD/CV) tariffs on Chinese goods, but the probe has left most of the country’s module supply hanging in limbo.
SEIA held a webinar this week to provide clarity on the investigative process, timelines, and its perspective on the potential impacts across the solar industry. The organization also revealed some preliminary findings from its survey on solar workers and companies already affected by the investigation.
John Smirnow, vice president of market strategy and general counsel for SEIA, reiterated a point he has made since Auxin Solar first submitted its petition to the Department of Commerce, calling the investigation the “biggest threat I’ve seen in my 15 years in the industry.”
Abigail Ross Hopper, the president and CEO of SEIA, also expressed anger and disbelief that the department and the administration of President Joe Biden would continue to pursue an investigation founded upon “baseless claims from a single petitioner, one which has previously made contradictory claims regarding the difficulty and logistics of American module manufacturing, the protection of which is what Auxin claims its petition is aimed at.”
To prove circumvention under US law, the work to create a product in a particular country must be minor and insignificant. The countries listed in the petition have invested billions of dollars to establish a manufacturing base. Fabricating solar cells and panels is a major and significant operation that SEIA asserts will take years to establish in the United States.
Behind the pervasive uncertainty of how much damage the investigation and possibility of tariffs could have on the US solar industry was an air of disbelief that the Federal government would pursue such an action, one which threatens to pull the rug out from underneath the renewable energy platform that Biden leaned on so heavily in his campaign.
And while the full scope of damage potential has yet to be realized, the preliminary results of SEIA’s survey show that some harm is already being felt.
Since launching the survey on April 1, SEIA has garnered more than 200 responses from companies operating across the entire solar value chain. Across every segment, at least 90% of the respondents said that the investigation alone will have a severe to devastating impact on their business in 2022 alone.
Just under 75% of respondents report that they are already experiencing canceled or delayed module shipments, while 11% have not yet been notified of delays, but expect them to come. What these delays have led to is half of all respondents sharing that 80% their 2022 pipeline is at risk, with that figure including already-completed projects.
Two-thirds of respondents said that 50% or more of their workforce is at risk of layoffs or termination, while one-third said that their entire workforce is at risk. For additional perspective, Justin Baca, vice president of markets and research with SEIA said that the figures are considerably higher than similar survey results taken in early 2020, at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and amid shutdowns and stay-at-home orders.
The impacts are not just contained to solar, either. SEIA said that more than 60% of respondents expect a severe or devastating impact on the energy storage industry, as most energy storage projects are paired with solar, a pairing that s required for them to reap their maximum incentive potential.
SEIA now sees its earlier projection that the investigation will lead to a module import shortfall of roughly 8GW as hopeful, rather than expected, with the potential for a much worst-case scenario rising.
The conclusion of the webinar was all about uncertainty. Nobody knows how the Department of Commerce is going to rule on the investigation. While a clear timeline exists for each step of the investigation, any step could be subject to an indefinite delay, further extending the issue. Hopper also claimed that tariffs historically lead to little to no positive impact to US manufacturing, while propagating palpable harm. She added that that the only way to grow manufacturing is policy and long-term certainty

The scientists described the small prototype as a “freeze-thaw battery” that cuts off the self-charge function when a battery is idling. “It’s a lot like growing food in your garden in the spring, putting the extra in a container in your freezer, and then thawing it out for dinner in the winter,” explained researcher Minyuan Miller Li.
The battery is charged by heating it to around 180 C, with its ions flowing through the liquid electrolyte. The device is then restored to room temperature and the electrolyte becomes solid, thus trapping the ions that transport the stored energy.
“The freeze-thaw phenomenon is possible because the battery’s electrolyte is molten salt – a molecular cousin of ordinary table salt. The material is liquid at higher temperatures but solid at room temperature,” the scientists said.
They noted that the battery can be heated again, as the ions restart flowing through the electrolyte when energy is needed. They built it with an aluminum anode and a nickel cathode, immersed in a sea of molten-salt electrolyte.

They added sulfur to the electrolyte to increase the battery’s storage capacity. A ceramic separator was embedded between the anode and the cathode to avoid breakage during the freeze-thaw cycle.
“The PNNL battery uses simple fiberglass, possible because of the battery’s stable chemistry. This cuts costs and makes the battery sturdier when undergoing freeze-thaw cycles,” said the scientists.
They claimed that the battery can retain 92% of its initial capacity over a period of 12 weeks. They said it has a theoretical energy density of 260 W/hours per kg.
“The battery’s energy is stored at a materials cost of about $23 per kilowatt-hour, measured before a recent jump in the cost of nickel,” they said. “The team is exploring the use of iron, which is less expensive, in hopes of bringing the materials cost down to around $6 per kilowatt-hour, roughly 15 times less than the materials cost of today’s lithium-ion batteries.
The scientists described the battery in “A freeze-thaw molten salt battery for seasonal storage,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science.

“The proposed system design can be replicated in different regions of Mexico and other latitudes,” researcher Tatiana Romero Castañon told pv magazine.
The incorporation of hydrogen would use excess renewable energy in winter for long-term storage, with the hydrogen facility consisting of an electrolyzer, a hydrogen tank, and a fuel cell system.
“The winter on the other hand, is very mild in this region of the country. Thus, there is no need to use any heating devices,” the scientists said.
In the proposed system configuration, which was modeled with Homer Pro software, the electricity generated by the microgrid's PV and wind installations is used for the microgrid's load demand and hydrogen generation through the electrolyzer. The microgrid consists of a 54.4kW photovoltaic system, a 60kW diesel generator, a 5kW wind turbine, and a 522kWh storage system.
The economic analysis was made by calculating the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the microgrid before and after the incorporation of the hydrogen facility.
“With LCOE, the incorporation of the Hydrogen storage system (P2G2P) into the microgrid can be analyzed as an alternative to reduce, and eventually substitute, diesel, storing hydrogen along the seasons,” said the scientists. “Puertecitos could be an optimal region for hydrogen applications because it has no access to the power grid, but also, the microgrid depends (in summer) on the diesel generation.”
Different scenarios were considered in the modeling, based on two main reference scenarios: a system with fuel cell capacities ranging from 3kW to 12kW, an electrolyzer capacity of between 6kW and 22kW, and a tank with a storage capacity between 2 kg and 8 kg. They also considered a system with fuel capacities between 5kW and 18kW, an electrolyzer capacity of 10kW to 38kW, and a hydrogen tank with capacity ranging from 10 kg and 40 kg.
Through their analysis, the academics found that the most cost-competitive scenario is offered by a combination of a 6kW fuel cell, a 6kW electrolyzer, and a 2kg hydrogen tank. They assumed a capex of $1,250/kW for the fuel cell, $1,250/kW for the electrolyzer, and $500/kg for the tank.
“The question remaining is whether the considered range of Capex technology will become a reality,” the scientists said. “The model showed that reducing in half the current capital cost of electrolyzers, fuel cells and hydrogen tanks, the P2G2P becomes competitive. For this scenario, mass production and short-term H2 technologies adoptions can reduce the time for being cost-competitive. Another way to accelerate H2 adoption might be a rise in diesel prices.”
They described the system design in “A techno-economic study for a hydrogen storage system in a microgrid located in baja California, Mexico. Levelized cost of energy for power to gas to power scenarios,” which was recently published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.

The IFC, the private-sector arm of the World Bank, said it has provided the “second-loss guarantee” for a loan portfolio worth the equivalent of $730 million belonging to Santander Bank Polska, the Polish business of Spanish lender Santander. The second-loss guarantee underwrites potential credit losses beyond an initial credit loss guarantee associated with the loans. The IFC did not specify the extent of the initial arrangement tied to the loan book, when it announced its contribution.
Describing the arrangement as “the first synthetic risk transfer (SRT) in emerging markets with a climate risk mitigation objective,” the IFC said it would free up Santander capital to back further lending in Poland for projects including credit for renewables, unspecified “energy” assets, water efficiency projects, and green building plans. SRT refers to the purchase of the credit loss guarantee by a bank from investors.
Steve Gandy, global head of product data management notes and structuring at Santander Corporate and Investment Banking, said that Santander Group had previously arranged synthetic risk transfers with the IFC in other markets. The IFC said the finance deal was the fourth synthetic risk transfer arranged by Santander Bank Polska.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/06/new-technologies-new-opportunities/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"APRIL 6, 2022","New technologies, new opportunities","A white paper published this week by UK analysts Exawatt and Germany's Nexwafe analyzes the current state of PV manufacturing. The study reveals opportunities and challenges for new technologies, particularly Nexwafe’s innovative “Epiwafer” process for the production of silicon wafers.
Nexwafe’s technology does away with the polysilicon production and ingot pulling stages of production, replacing them with a process that grows wafers direct from silicon tetrachloride gas, or the trichlorosilane gas that’s today used as the feedstock for polysilicon production. By cutting these heavy, industrial stages from the PV supply chain the process promises lower manufacturing costs, lower equipment capex and reduced environmental impacts, as well as potentially better quality, thinner wafers able to reach higher efficiencies once processed into cells.
The white paper, which is available for download from Nexwafe’s website, seeks to place this technology within the context of today’s PV manufacturing landscape and evaluate its potential. Nexwafe is currently developing a 500MW demonstration line for its technology in Germany, and last year picked up €39 million ($42.5 million) in an investment round led by India’s Reliance Industries. Despite these successes, the technology still has a way to go to prove itself at scale.
Exawatt finds significant opportunity for this new technology to play off of other developments in PV manufacturing. And it is able to produce wafers at any size, avoiding reported challenges in ingot pulling for the largest 210 mm format.
The process also allows for wafers to be made much thinner than the current ingot/diamond wire saw processing allows. Nexwafe CEO Davor Sutija recently told pv magazine that the company would most likely produce its first wafers at 120 microns, and that it could go much thinner than this later on, if manufacturers are able to improve handling of the thinner, more fragile products in other stages. Exawatt notes that this would offer an advantage or heterojunction cells in particular, where the optimal thickness is 100 microns or even less, while PERC and TOPCon structures work best on a cell between 150 and 200 microns, as can be achieved using the current processes.
Nexwafe’s process also promises lower oxygen content and even dopant distribution – adding up to as much as 1.1% absolute efficiency gain, as well as opening up further possibilities. “In the longer term, the high level of process control afforded by the EpiWafer process could allow for additional techniques to be employed to continue pushing cell efficiencies higher, for examplethough the incorporation of quantum wells,” states Exawatt.
Market opportunity
The recent push for energy security and localized PV supply chains also creates an opportunity for regions outside of China to produce a differentiated production, rather than trying to compete on scale with established industry giants. Exawatt notes that Nexwafe has signed letters of intent with several of the key players looking to establish PV manufacturing outside of China, alongside the investment from Reliance in India.
The biggest remains the scaleup from “lab to fab,” with Exawatt warning that the initial 500MW facility in Germany will not be cost competitive with current wafer prices, though this model begins to improve once Nexwafe reaches larger capacities of 3GW and then 6GW.
“From a financial perspective, the key challenge will be to successfully scale up and bridge the gap from lab-scale production to high volume. From a technical perspective, it will be key to demonstrate that the theoretical increases in cell efficiencies afforded by EpiWafers can be realized in practice in cell manufacturing,” the report concludes. If that potential can be realized, the PV industry may yet see another revolution in wafer manufacturing.”

Tata Power Solar, the solar unit of Tata Power, has commissioned a 160MW AC solar project at Jetsar, in the Indian state of Rajasthan.
The project was won by state-run power producer NTPC under a tariff-based competitive bidding conducted by Solar Energy Corp. of India in 2019. The installation uses around 6,75,000 monocrystalline PV modules and is expected to produce 387 million units of energy per year.
“The Jetsar project was completed within a period of 15 months, which is a testament to Tata Power Solar’s exceptional project execution capabilities. The project engineers worked under tough climatic conditions, including the movement of men and machinery to the project site,” Tata Power said.
Tata Power Solar was originally formed in 1989 as a joint venture between Tata Power and British Petroleum Solar (BP Solar). Headquartered in Bangalore, it now operates independently as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Power.
Tata Power Solar is one of the largest solar manufacturers in India, with a production capacity of 580MW of modules and 530MW cells. It has a portfolio of more than 8.3GW of ground-mount utility-scale, and 950MW of rooftop projects across the country. It has also installed over 65,000 solar water pumps in India.
