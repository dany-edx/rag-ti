Portugal has announced revisions to the 2030 National Energy and Climate Plan (PNEC) under the slogan “a greener country, sooner.” It now hopes achieve climate neutrality by 2045.
The updated energy strategy aims for 80% of electricity in the country to be renewable by 2026, and 85% by 2030. The revised plan sets a target of 20.4 GW of operational PV systems in 2030, with 14.9 GW for utility-scale plants and 5.5 GW for distributed generation.
The government said that solar plant deployment should not exceed 0.4% of national territory and has called for compensation and community involvement. The new plan also includes improvements to authorization processes, designated areas, regulatory frameworks for distributed generation and energy communities, and new financial incentives.
Portugal’s cumulative PV capacity hit 2.59 GW at the end of 2022, outpacing the growth of other renewable energy sources. The latest statistics from Portugal's Directorate General for Energy and Geology (DGEG) also show that the country added just 118 MW of new solar capacity in the first four months of 2023.
BloombergNEF predicts that Portugal's solar installations will reach 1,363 MW by the end of 2023, a substantial increase compared to 890 MW last year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/03/engie-to-build-60-minigrids-in-zambia/,"COMMUNITY,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MINIGRID,ZAMBIA",MARIJA MAISCH,"JULY 3, 2023",Engie unit to build 60 minigrids in Zambia,"Investment in the offgrid solar sector continues to grow, with the latest transaction involving $7.5 million of senior debt for the construction of 60 minigrids in Zambia. The projects, with around 5 MW of cumulative capacity, are intended to bring electricity to more than 40,000 people living in rural areas.
MySol Grid Zambia, a subsidiary of EEA, secured the funds from FEI, which was established by the African Development Bank and managed by UK-based investment bank Cygnum Capital.
MySol Grid Zambia is a leading player in the African offgrid market. In 2022, EEA had more than 1.5 million solar home systems sold and 16 minigrids in operation, as a result of bringing US solar home system business Fenix International, Berlin-based Mobisol, and Engie PowerCorner minigrids under one roof. Its projects have affected 7 million people in nine countries across Africa.
Last year, EEA signed the largest minigrid transaction in Africa with CrossBoundary Energy Access, at $60 million, to provide electricity access to more than 150,000 people in Nigeria. However, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the solar minigrid sector needs $187 billion of investment to achieve universal energy access by 2030.
Following the latest transaction, MySol Grid Zambia will construct, own and operate the minigrids under the Increased Access to Electricity and Renewable Energy Production (IAEREP) program. As part of IAEREP, the European Union previously allocated €6 million ($6.5 million) grants to Engie’s offgrid unit in the context of the EU Global Gateway initiative.
“Attracting non-recourse long-term debt financing for mini-grid projects is proof of the viability of the business model and the legitimacy of renewable mini-grid projects in the rural electrification landscape,” said Engie Energy Access CEO Gillian-Alexandre Huart.
Indeed, the offgrid solar sector has made significant progress in attracting finance, with companies offering pay-as-you-go and cash sale options for solar home systems, solar lanterns, solar appliances, and solar water pumps. In 2022, the sector secured $746 million, up 63% from the previous year, according to the Global Off-Grid Lighting Association (GOGLA).
However, this remains far from the $23.3 billion needed to achieve the SDG7 goal of clean, modern electricity for all.  Today, more than 730 million people still live without access.
In Zambia, specifically, the need for rural electrification is dire. According to World Bank data, in 2021 Zambia’s national electrification rate stood at 46.7 %, with only 14.5% of the rural population having access to electricity.
The country’s population is highly dispersed across rural areas, which makes expansion of the national grid economically and technically challenging. Therefore, decentralized energy solutions, including offgrid solar, are critical to the Zambian government’s efforts to achieve its official target of universal access to energy by 2030. The government’s stated goal by 2023 was to deploy 500 MW of solar PV.

Enea has designed a map documenting Italy's potential for agrivoltaics deployment.
“The map is now being validated and it will be accessible online in the future,” the agency said, noting that it is mainly designed to help to identify potential sites for agrivoltaics development.
The Enea Research Center in Portici, near Naples, developed the map with the support of the AgrivoltaicoSostenibile@ENEA task force and AIAS, the Italian Sustainable Agrivoltaic Association chaired by Enea itself. The map is based on indicators related to qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the Italian landscape.
“The potential of agrivoltaics in the national context is usually assessed on the basis of the topographical characteristics and the extension of the available agricultural areas,” said Enea researcher Grazia Fattoruso. “The methodology developed in our Geomatics laboratory considers both the various factors that can influence the solar photovoltaic potential of a given area, such as geophysical, technical and environmental factors, and the factors that can influence the agricultural yield, such as the different types of soil, land use capacity, and water scarcity.”
Six different working groups in Italy are actively supporting the bodies responsible for implementing agrivoltaics. These groups focus on sustainable certification, legislation and implementation, training, agriculture technologies, and landscape considerations.
“It is essential to underline how training is crucial for the entire agricultural system, which in recent years has been affected by changes that require innovation,” Enea said. “In this context, sustainable agrivoltaics act as an ‘aggregator' capable of putting innovations into a system starting from the needs expressed by the operators involved.”
In April, the Italian government launched a new incentive scheme to support innovative agrivoltaic solutions. The program is part of the country's National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR) and has a budget of €1.1 billion ($1.2 billion), which should be enough to deploy around 1.04 GW of PV capacity by June 2026.

“Our new products utilize rectangular silicon wafers and innovative module technologies like super multi-busbar (SMBB) design and double-layer coated glass, resulting in significant improvements in product conversion efficiency and stability,” said Huang Haiyan, Astronergy's chief sustainability officer, in an interview with pv magazine. “We achieved a maximum module efficiency of 22.7% and a maximum power output of 615 W for this series.”
The manufacturer aims to ship 30 GW of solar modules in 2023, up more than 100% growth from 2022.
“By the end of 2022, we had approximately 20 GW of module capacity,” Huang said. “This number will increase to 50 GW by the end of this year, along with a corresponding growth in solar cell capacity to 45 GW.”
Astronergy predicts substantial growth in the global PV market this year, with an estimated 350 GW to 380 GW of newly deployed capacity worldwide, including 120 MW of new PV in China.
“We anticipate that our domestic sales will account for 55% to 60% of our total sales this year, while the overseas market will contribute 40% to 45%,” Huang said. “Last year, we shipped over 1 GW in Germany, capturing approximately 14% of the market share. We have also established a strong presence in other European markets such as Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Additionally, we are performing well in traditional and emerging markets like the US, Brazil, and Australia.”

It did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. The completion of the transaction is expected in the second quarter of next year, with all projects located in Teleorman county, southern Romania.
Franck Neel, member of the OMV Petrom executive board, responsible for gas and power, said that the acquisition aligns with OMV Petrom's goal of reaching an installed renewables capacity of at least 1 GW by 2030, including through partnerships.
OMV Petrom has already installed PV systems on the rooftops of 40 gas stations in Romania. It entered the renewable energy sector in 2010 with the purchase of a wind farm.
Romania is now developing several large PV installations, including a recently acquired 1,044 MW solar project by UK independent power producer Rezolv Energy, which has the potential to become Europe's largest PV plant.

Chile recorded all-time highs for the curtailment of renewable energy projects between January and May 2023, according to Acera, the Chilean renewable energy association.
During this period, 735 GWh of renewable energy could not be integrated into the grid, marking an 86% increase from the same period in 2022. This is equivalent to the operation of a 600 MW solar plant.
In 2022, renewable energy curtailment amounted to 1,471 GWh. PV plants in the north of the country were primarily affected, but curtailment also occurs in the south, where wind power plants are more prevalent.
PV asset owners in the sunny northern regions previously faced negative prices due to high power production and limited evacuation opportunities to meet energy demand in the central and southern parts of Chile.
As of March, Chile had 14,305 MW of installed renewable energy capacity, including 8,220 MW of PV installations. About 170 MW of the solar power capacity comes from distributed-generation systems built under the country's net billing scheme. Most of the capacity comes from utility-scale solar facilities, which are primarily located in the northern part of Chile.

The agency reported 5,359 cases of illegal fund management, with 3,010 involving solar projects inflating installation costs for excessive loans through the tender scheme. The cases mainly involve illegal loan execution, unlawful subsidy allocation, and bid rigging.
This is the second investigation by South Korean authorities on renewable energy subsidy allocation. The first investigation identified 2,267 cases of illegal fund management across 12 local governments during the previous government's five-year period.
South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) recently reduced feed-in tariff policy and renewable energy certificates (REC) issuance under the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) scheme for 2023 onwards. This led to a 50% decrease in the solar PV bid size under the REC scheme, from 2,000 MW to 1,000 MW.
The South Korean Energy Agency held two 4 GW PV tenders, allocating capacity in 2 GW and 2.2 GW rounds in 2021, and contracting 1.2 GW and 1.4 GW in 2020.
South Korea has 20.9 GW of installed PV capacity, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

The company claims that the new product offers the advantage of being an antitheft solution, as aluminum costs significantly less than copper, and aluminum cables are less targeted by thieves than their copper counterparts.
GBP said the new aluminum cables are compatible with the international standards 4 mm² x 95 mm², 4 mm² x 120 mm², 1 mm² x 150 mm², 1 mm² x 185 mm², 1 mm² x 240 mm², and 1 mm² x 300 mm².
“The conductivity of aluminum cables is around 60% that of copper cables,” the manufacturer said. “But by selecting an appropriate size, it is possible to achieve the same performance as copper conductors. In addition, since aluminum cables are 30 to 50% lighter and more flexible than copper cables, they ensure an easier installation process, shorten the construction period, and save labor costs.”
GBP claimed that the use of its new cable may reduce the cost of a PV project by up to 10%. “It complies with German standards,” the provider said. “Anti-theft measures such as our aluminum cables are also attracting attention overseas.”
Aluminum is less expensive than copper, but it is susceptible to oxidation. Furthermore, aluminum is also more brittle even at normal temperatures and breaks more easily than copper.
In practice, aluminum cables are rarely used in smaller roof installations and are mostly utilized in large scale PV facilities. These cables require a thicker cross-section than copper cables for the same output and thus also a little more space.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/03/new-method-to-avoid-overvoltage-in-vertical-pv-linked-to-low-voltage-grids/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,FINLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 3, 2023",New method to avoid overvoltage in vertical PV linked to low-voltage grids,"Researchers at the University of Turku in Finland have developed a methodological workflow to boost electricity yield in bifacial vertical PV systems that are connected to low-voltage (LV) grids located at high latitudes and have different panel locations, orientations, and technologies.
They explained that their new approach is intended at avoiding voltage rise in the network, which occurs when PV generation exceeds demand, with high voltages becoming potentially able to damage the grid itself and the electrical devices connected to it. “Thus, the voltage must be restricted below a threshold either by identifying the distribution grid’s maximum allowed PV capacity or by setting a limit to the maximum allowed PV production and curtailing excess production,” they explained.
The new methodology works through five main steps: data collection, decomposition modeling, transposition modeling, electrical and thermal modeling, and LV grid analysis. The second and third steps provide a calculated global tilted irradiance (GTI) profile for the chosen location, time, and PV orientation, which is then converted to PV electricity output, considering weather data and PV system properties. The LV grid analysis prevents the oversizing of the PV system in order to avoid overvoltage.
The scientists applied the workflow to different cases of monofacial projects and bifacial vertical PV systems. They analyzed the PV production profile, electricity load profile, and the combination of variables to the PV hosting capacity, which they said is the key factor in avoiding overvoltage events.
Through their analysis, the academics ascertained that the maximum allowed PV capacity is generally limited by short temporal periods with a duration of between 1 and 30 minutes. These phases are characterized by high PV generation and sudden variations in the electricity load and PV production. “This highlights that managing such periods with different voltage regulation devices or allowing over- and undervoltage events to occur in the short term can significantly increase the PV hosting capacity,” they stated.
According to their findings, vertical bifacial PV may have a 46% higher power yield compared to monofacial conventional counterparts in the Nordics, while also having an improved temporal match between PV generation and consumption.
The new method is presented in the paper “A comprehensive methodological workflow to maximize solar energy in low-voltage grids: A case study of vertical bifacial panels in Nordic conditions,” published in Solar Energy.
“Further work is needed to include more realistic electricity load models and economic analyses in the methodology,” the Finnish team concluded. “Moreover, since the used test network only covered very small geographic area, resulting in low losses in power lines, it was likely to overestimate the absolute values of maximum PV production compared to most real-world distribution grids, although this allowed the comparison of the relative values between different cases.”

The court has named Georg Jakob Stemshorn from German law firm Pluta Rechtsanwalts GmbH as the interim insolvency administrator, as the company recently declared that it had insufficient funds to meet immediate financial requirements.
Tubesolar specializes in producing thin-film PV tubes for agrivoltaic applications, assembling them into modules that maintain high transparency levels. Stemshorn said that business operations will initially continue without interruption, while the company assesses its financial situation and explores restructuring options.
With approximately 140 employees, Tubesolar's insolvency money secures their salaries for the next three months, as paying employee wages is a top priority. The insolvency administrator will timely submit the corresponding application to the employment agency. The insolvency administrator also aims to initiate an investor process to seek a viable solution for the company, given its innovative technology.
Tubesolar had plans to scale up production from lab scale to 250 MW in the future. In late May, its management board attempted to avoid insolvency by issuing a convertible bond and announced cost-cutting measures such as implementing short-time work.
US thin-film solar manufacturer Solyndra faced bankruptcy in August 2011, despite securing a $535 million (€453 million) loan guarantee from the US Department of Energy. It claimed to be a victim of dumping by state-backed Chinese solar companies. Since then, cylindrical devices have fallen out of favor.

Genex said the AUD 44.5 million ($29.63 million) structured funding package will be used to shore up financing for the company’s flagship 250 MW/2 GWh Kidston Pumped Storage Hydro project in northern Queensland and to develop its multi-stage Bulli Creek solar and battery project near Toowoomba.
J-Power, which is among Genex’s largest shareholders following an AUD 25 million equity investment announced in 2019, has agreed to provide a corporate loan facility of AUD 35 million as a standby source of funding for the 250 MW, eight-hour pumped hydro project.
Genex said the funding may not be needed but in the wake of a drilling incident late last year that set construction back, the replenishment of the project contingency is considered prudent to ensure the project remains on track for energization in 2024.
It was estimated the incident, which resulted in water unexpectedly leaking into a tunnel, added AUD 10 million to AUD 15 million to the project’s cost.
“While the costs of the water ingress event at the Kidston pumped storage hydro project last year have been fully funded, we consider it prudent that additional funding is secured against any further unforeseen events during the balance of the construction program,” Genex Chief Executive Officer James Harding said. “The loan facility with J-Power gives us significant buffer to complete the construction of the project.”
On top of the loan facility, J-Power will also establish a joint development fund for Genex’s Bulli Creek solar and battery project which is expected to be developed in five stages. The first stage will entail the delivery of a 400 MW/1,600 MWh big battery. while the second proposed stage would deliver a 475 MW to 675 MW solar project.
The joint development agreement gives J-Power a 50% interest in the project courtesy of upfront acquisition funding of AUD 2.5 million and a further $6 million in upfront funding for third party development costs.

An Oregon State University study shows that most of the prime, flat land near grid load is already in use as farmland, growing food or ranching livestock. In many US markets, including the Pacific Northwest, agrivoltaics is a solution for the food versus energy transition dilemma.
Agrivoltaics provides benefits for the farmer or landowner, the project developer and local communities. Ranching holds particular promise in the agrivoltaics community. It creates better soil composition for cows, sheep and other farm animals to graze, while creating a more natural soil composition around the panels, according to the Oregon State study.
David McFeeters-Krone, a founder of Rute Foundations and developer of a cattle farming agrivoltaics project in eastern Oregon, told pv magazine USA that his development, Bear Valley Solar Pasture, LLC, is currently engaged with a fourth-generation cattle grazer in Grant County, Oregon. The project is receiving oversight from Oregon State University’s agrivoltaics program for land use management, water and soil studies on the farm’s site.   
The farmer, Jack Southworth was previously approached by an undisclosed large solar developer interested in taking over the farm as a whole, McFeeters-Krone recalls. With cattle revenue at a base rate of about $10 per acre, the farmer did not want to exclusively lease the entire ranch even though solar sited in the same area could produce $700 to $1,000 per acre from added revenue.  
Southworth Brothers Ranch runs a total of 650 cows and calves, and 600 yearlings, said the developer.
In October 2022, Southworth reached out to Serkan Ates, who studies pasture and grazing management at Oregon State in conjunction with Chad Higgins, an associate professor who heads the university’s agrivoltaics program, the developer said.  By early 2023, the developer was doing demonstration projects with Oregon State and began working with Southworth on his ranch.

Green Gravity and Western Australia-based mining contractor RUC have agreed to collaborate on the technical opportunities, data insights and commercial arrangements associated with gravitational energy storage systems.
Green Gravity aims to use gravity to generate clean, dispatchable energy. Its technology relies on lifting and lowering ultra-heavy weights in legacy mine shafts and in doing so, turning a turbine that creates electricity – essentially providing an alternative to pumped hydro or batteries without the need for water or chemicals.
Green Gravity Chief Executive Officer Mark Swinnerton said the company’s energy storage technology “represents a breakthrough in the search for economic long-duration storage of renewable energy.”
“Green Gravity is bringing new technology to an existing population of mineshafts,” he said. “By re-using mining assets, costs can be kept low. By using gravity as the fuel, we dispense with consuming the critical water, land, and chemicals which other storage technologies rely on.”
Swinnerton said the partnership with RUC brings together the mining contractor’s capability in shaft sinking and mineshaft hoisting operations with Green Gravity’s technology, a combination which he believes “has the potential to significantly accelerate and to improve the deployment of gravitational energy storage systems into mineshafts … With detailed design underway for our commercial-scale energy storage system, integrating the global scale and innovative thinking of RUC to areas like the vertical transit system and mine winder design will generate superior outcomes for the technology.”
The signing of the deal follows Green Gravity’s recent announcement that it would partner with BlueScope to build a 12-metre-tall prototype at the steel manufacturer’s Port Kembla Steelworks. The research and development facility will also include a digital twin that can be used to test new components or hypothesis before they are trialled in the physical world.
“[The] lab will enable power generation capacity and efficiency to be validated in addition to data that will support Green Gravity technology to connect to the power grid at large-scale,” Swinnerton said. “This allows us to have great confidence in the mine site and convince the mining operators to say, ‘It’s working over here’, and that’s a way of building confidence.”
