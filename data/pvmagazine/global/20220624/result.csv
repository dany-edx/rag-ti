The team has found that such materials could result in an electric yield enlargement by converting ultraviolet (UV) light to visible, while also providing UV shielding.
“The DC materials can absorb the high-energy photon (300–500 nm) and re-emit a longer-wavelength photon to which the photovoltaic (PV) device is more sensitive,” the academics said. “Various types of DC materials have been investigated for this purpose like quantum dots (QDs), oxides, luminescent glasses, lanthanides, and organic dyes.”
They have argued that such materials should be used to overcome the poor blue response of solar cells, while absorbing short-wavelength light, typically in the 300 nm to 500 nm range, and re-emit it at a longer wavelength. They focused on lanthanide and non-lanthanide DC materials.
“Photoluminescence is an attractive property of lanthanides and exhibits sharp emission peaks with high color purity,” they explained.
They said that this luminescence is the outcome of the radiative and nonradiative transition of an electronically excited ion. Lanthanides are commonly used as alloys to impart strength and hardness to metals.
The DC materials could be easily doped in the charge transport or perovskite photoactive layer in order to be used to improve perovskite cells, the scientists said. They should have dual-functional properties to facilitate charge carrier transport.
“Most of the lanthanide DC material synthesis processes required high temperature, and also their material availability on Earth are limited, which restrict them for future applications,” the group said. “The development of nonlanthanide DC materials can be an approach for future cost-effective device applications.”
They described their findings in “Downconversion Materials for Perovskite Solar Cells,” which was recently published in RLL Solar. The team includes scientists from Swansea University in the United Kingdom, the Khalifa University of Science and Technology in the United Arab Emirates, the CSIR-National Physical Laboratory and the University of Jammu in India, and the Indian Institute of Technology.
“This review may allow researchers working on the PSCs to develop more photostable devices and consequently help in future commercialization in an increasingly green energy market,” the scientists said. “Future focus will also be on utilizing the whole incoming spectrum from IR to UV in photovoltaic devices.”

The UK startup calls it the world's first “hydrogen hypercar.” It claimed that the Apricale “is the ultimate proof that hydrogen is the best solution for any vehicle where weight is a critical factor.” Pininfarina built the body, while Viritech developed the powertrain technology. They will put the car into limited production in 2023, with plans to make 25 cars  per year at Pininfarina's facilities.
H2 Clipper has completed a simulated wind tunnel test of its hydrogen-powered airship, by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). “The analysis confirms that the airship's aerodynamic design achieves an extremely low level of residual drag and is another step in validating the airship's operating performance and the company's cost modeling,” said the California-based aerospace company. It aims to complete a prototype in 2025 and fly its first full-sized airship in 2028.
The European Commission and the Norwegian government have agreed to strengthen their cooperation in the energy field, with up to 100 TWh of extra energy to be supplied to the European market this year. Their medium-term hydrogen plans include joint cooperation on offshore renewables and carbon capture and storage (CCS). In line with this, ENOVA has also announced NOK 1.12 billion (€0.11 billion) of funding for hydrogen production, infrastructure, and vehicle projects along the Norwegian coast.
Ember said in a newly published report that electrolyzers, interconnections, and clean dispatchable generation will be the three key technologies needed for Europe to achieve a clean electricity system based on solar and wind by 2035. The London-based climate think tank said that granular modeling shows Europe can operate a 95% clean power system without compromising reliability, even with unfavorable climatic conditions. “By 2035, wind and solar output frequently exceed demand, at which point electrolyzers convert excess supply into green hydrogen,” it said. “The electrolyzer fleet grows to 200 GW to 400 GW by 2035.”
Siemens Energy and Air Liquide have announced the creation of a joint venture dedicated to the series production of industrial-scale renewable hydrogen electrolyzers in Europe. “Production is expected to begin in the second half of 2023 and ramp-up to an annual production capacity of 3 GW by 2025,” said the Franco-German partnership.
Airbus and Linde have signed a memorandum of understanding in Berlin to develop hydrogen infrastructure at airports throughout the world. “Both companies will define and launch pilot projects at several airports from early 2023 onwards,” wrote the European aerospace manufacturer. 
Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) and a leading group of German companies have released a green hydrogen roadmap. They outlined recommendations for governments and the industry for large-scale green hydrogen imports to Germany.
RWE and ArcelorMittal have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop, build and operate offshore wind farms and hydrogen facilities, in order to produce low-emissions steel in Germany. The two companies will start with a 70 MW pilot plant in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstad by 2026. Planned increases to gigawatt-scale projects over the long term will depend on public funding.
Gasgrid Finland has secured support from the Finnish government for its expansion plans. It aims to work on hydrogen transmission infrastructure and the development of a related hydrogen market. It will set up a subsidiary, VetyVerkko, to develop hydrogen transmission projects. 
Nuvera Fuel Cells has received an order for an E-Series Fuel Cell Engine from CMT, a propulsion technology research institute at the Universitat Politècnica de València Spain. CMT will evaluate the use of Nuvera's fuel cell engines in the road and aerospace sectors.

It launched the exercise in April and received proposals from 106 bidders.
“The number of 152 construction sites have been identified in 30 provinces of the country and introduced to investors in the form of 95 baskets for the construction of power plant,” it said. “It is worth mentioning that the minimum and maximum capacity of the identified sites in the tender amounts to 10 MW up to 250 MW.”
The selected developers will be awarded 20-year power purchase agreements at a fixed tariff. The tender is part of a plan that was recently announced by the Iranian Ministry of Energy to install 10 GW of renewable energy capacity over the next four years, in line with a broader plan to deploy 30 GW of generating capacity.
Iran has an installed renewables capacity of around 1 GW, with solar accounting for about 456 MW of the total. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country installed around 26 MW of new PV capacity in 2021, 50 MW in 2020, and around 90 MW in 2019.

The system has a capacity of 44 kW and uses composite beams to support the solar panels. It features high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes to provide system buoyancy.
“The composite beams are arranged in east-west orientation with a 15-degree tilt and the solar panels are mounted in portrait mode for maximum utilization of the standard-length HDPE pipe,” the researchers said. “Four of the strings are west facing, while the other four are east facing.”
They used two different kinds of solar panels provided by Norway-based REC Group – the REC Solar N-Peak 315 W and the REC Solar TwinPeak 295 W.
“Each string contains 18 modules, and for each module type there are two strings facing west and two strings facing east, giving a total of eight strings in the FPV system,” the researchers said. “Each pair of strings with the same module type and orientation is connected in parallel to a separate maximum power point tracker (MPPT) on the same inverter.”
The inverter is a 50 kW SMA device with a total of 6 MPPTs. The group describes the system as having a small footprint and a relatively open structure, as the modules are located close to the water surface.
The group compared the performance of the floating array with a reference 2.5 kW installation on the reservoir's shore for a period of a year. The reference system consists of eight south-facing REC Solar N-Peak 315 W type modules with an 8-degree tilt.

The academics discovered that the floating PV installation did not have any performance issues. However, the dam at which it was installed had been dry for some time.
“When compared with the closely situated ground-mounted PV system, the relative yield difference during times of stable performance is 0.6% in favor of the FPV system, which is within the margin of error of installed capacity and is not considered a substantial difference in performance,” they stated. “The results show an overall performance of the system in the same range as other floating PV systems located in similar climates.”
They presented their findings in “The performance and amphibious operation potential of a new floating photovoltaic technology,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.
“To assess the degradation and reliability of the system, three years of operational data is needed and will be reported on a later stage,” they said.

The weekly average price was CNY 273/kg. The increase was mainly due to a reduction in production output of around 3,500 metric tons (MT). The association said other factories will also start seasonal maintenance in July, and this will continue to weigh on supply and drive up prices.
Tongwei has agreed to supply Yuze Semiconductor with 161,100 MT of polysilicon over a period of four and a half years. Yuze is a wafer producer for the solar and semiconductor industry. The company will buy polysilicon from Tongwei at a monthly negotiated price to the end of 2026.
Beijing Energy International said the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) bill for a 112 MW agrivoltaic project it is developing in Shandong province has risen by CNY 42 million to CNY 478 million. Nenggao Automation is the EPC contractor on the project.
Golden Power has revealed plans to spend AUD 104,000 ($72,000) on a 51% stake in Australian electricity software developer Ienergy Power. The deal is dependent on Ienergy securing a license from the Australian Energy Regulator to operate as an energy retailer. Golden Power said it would then lend an unspecified sum to Ienergy to develop an end-market for the heterojunction PV modules assembled from its wafers and for flexible modules in the Australian residential PV market.
Huasun has signed a co-operation agreement with Switzerland-based EcoSolifer Group, which has 100 MW of annual production capacity in Hungary.

Researchers around the world have been “tuning out the defects” of perovskite solar cells, and are now much closer to manufacturing long lasting, cheap, high efficiency (more than 30%) modules.
When Covid-19 temporarily subsided in the fall of 2020, a group of Princeton researchers returned to campus to find that one of their experiments on perovskite solar cell layers had run for almost six months with nearly zero loss of efficiency. The scientists recognized that they had discovered a thin layer that gave their perovskite cells a much longer lifespan, and that they needed to greatly speed up their testing procedures.
 
In their paper, “Accelerated aging of all-inorganic, interface-stabilized perovskite solar cells,” the scientists describe a layer so thin that they call it “2D,” and sometimes describe it as having no thickness at all. The layer is placed on the perovskite solar cell, “capping” and protecting the photovoltaic material from breaking down.
The ultra-thin capping layer – Cs2PbI2Cl2 – fits between the charge carrying layer, made of cupric salt mixed with other materials, and the CsPbI3 based perovskite solar cells. The capping layer was estimated at 20 nanometers in thickness.
The scientists noted that in order to maximize the thermal and photostability of their cells, they chose a slightly less efficient, all inorganic perovskite solar cell material combination.
 
The scientists showed the uncapped and capped solar cells as they are tested over periods up to 4,000 hours under different temperatures. The capped solar cell tested at 35 C showed zero efficiency losses after 3,551 hours.
Extrapolating these test results suggests that the perovskite layer, with its capping in place, would last for at least 30 years, retaining more than 80% of its original output under standard outside conditions.
The accelerated testing technique – seemingly very simple – was to blow hot air at increasing temperatures, which would generate additional wear and tear, simulating additional time going on. The perovskite solar cells were aged under continuous illumination from a Philips metal-halide lamp – specifically the Philips MSR 1200 HR.
After the testing, when placing the solar cells under microscopes, you can see the differences after 2,000 hours of testing between capped and uncapped units.

Okra Solar’s mission to provide reliable renewable energy solutions to people living off-grid in developing nations has received a major boost, with the startup raising $3 million to ramp up the distribution of its Internet of Things-enabled mesh-grids.
Launched in 2016, Okra has developed an artificial intelligence-enabled mesh-grid that shares power through an interconnected network of homes. The plug-and-play solar home system includes a solar panel, battery and a smart device. A cloud-based system monitors usage and required maintenance, while allowing for remote control.
At present, the company is focused on the Philippines, Haiti, Cambodia and Nigeria, which is home to the world’s largest unelectrified population, totalling approximately 80 million people. The funding was led by Singapore-based technology fund and advisory group SDGx, Schneider Electric Energy Access, Autodesk Foundation, Explorer Investments and Didendum. Okra is also opening its Series A round, with the aim of raising another $6 million to help finance its expansion into other countries.
SDGx Chief Impact Officer Zarmeen Parvi said Okra Solar ticked all the boxes for the technology fund.
“It’s rare to see an Australian company scale so successfully into many international markets so quickly,” he said. “Okra Solar brings an impact multiplier that intersects and positively contributes towards energy access. This is a great example of how an impact multiplier also drives scale with commercial outcomes, while solving the world’s GHG emissions and climate change problems.”
Okra Solar CEO Afnan Hannan said the funding will be used to scale up commercial operations and product development in Nigeria and Haiti as the company looks to expand.
“It feels great to lock in this funding so that we can accelerate our growth,” he said. “We’re excited to continue charging towards providing energy access for the 770 million people living in off-grid communities. Our mesh-grids leverage IoT and automation to make last-mile electrification affordable and sustainable … even for the most remote villages on the planet. Our innovation has spurred global demand from utility companies.”

Infrastructure Australia has provided its endorsement for the economic benefits of the Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink), which would export solar power from the Australian outback to Singapore via a submarine transmission link.
The endorsement ensures that the project can advance to third-stage, “investment-ready” status on Infrastructure Australia's priority list, opening the door for government funding.
Singapore-based Sun Cable is seeking to develop a giant solar PV and battery energy storage complex on a 12,000-hectare site in Australia's Northern Territory. The project includes a 17 GW to 20 GW solar farm and between 36 GWh and 42 GWh of energy storage.
Once operational, AAPowerLink will supply power to Darwin and to Singapore via a 4,200-kilometer transmission network, including a 750 km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800 km submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore. The project is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power more than 3 million homes a year.
“The Australia-Asia PowerLink will be transformative for the country on multiple fronts,” said PwC Australia Chief Executive Officer Tom Seymour.
After completing its own assessment of the economic impact of the project, Infrastructure Australia, which first added AAPowerLink to its Infrastructure Priority Initiative List in 2021, provided its endorsement, recommending the project for commonwealth investment.

Infrastructure Australia acknowledged that delivering AAPowerLink “will undoubtedly be challenging, but not insurmountable.” It said the project will support economic activity from spinoff industries to support the proposal’s construction and operation. The advisory body said the developers had produced a strong business case and were continuing to develop the project.
“The AAPowerLink is economically viable and will deliver significant benefits for Australia and our region,” said Sun Cable CEO David Griffin. “The AAPowerLink will enable a stronger economy for the long term through contracts, wages and economic diversification.”
The project has already secured key approvals, with the Australian government awarding it Major Project Status. The Indonesian government has also approved the submarine transmission cable route.
Sun Cable hopes to reach financial close by the start of 2024, with construction to start in the same year. The first electricity is expected to be supplied to Darwin in 2027, with the project to be fully operational by 2029.

First Solar has announced an agreement with National Grid Renewables for 2 GW of Cadmium Telluride film solar modules to be delivered in 2024 and 2025 throughout the United States.
The deal was booked prior to the release of First Solar’s first-quarter 2022 earnings in April and also prior to the US government's announcement on the two-year tariff exemption for solar modules manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. It also invoked the Defense Production Act to accelerate US manufacturing.
Last August, First Solar broke ground on its third manufacturing facility in Ohio. The new 3.3 GW facility is scheduled to start operations in the first half of 2023 and represents a $680 million investment.
Once it is fully operational, the facility is expected to scale the company’s northwestern Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6 GW, which would make it the largest fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing complex outside of China. First Solar has invested more than $2 billion in its US manufacturing footprint. When its third factory is fully operational, will directly employ more than 2,500 people in Ohio, while supporting an estimated 15,000 indirect jobs through its US supply chain.
In addition to its Ohio manufacturing facilities, First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia. It is also building a new 3.3 GW factory in India that is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2023.
Minneapolis-based National Grid Renewables has a portfolio of solar, wind, and energy storage projects throughout the United States. In the past, National Grid Renewables and First Solar have partnered on multiple projects, including the recently operational 200 MW Prairie Wolf Solar Project in Illinois and the currently under construction 275 MW Noble Solar and 125 MWh Storage Project in Texas.
“National Grid Renewables and First Solar share more than just deep roots in the US Midwest and a longstanding strategic partnership. We share a common view on the need to create a sustainable energy future,” said Nathan Franzen, vice president, Development for National Grid Renewables. “We’re pleased to be working with First Solar as we continue on our mission to deploy clean, economically beneficial and community-focused solar energy projects, powered by responsibly produced American solar technology.”
First Solar recently announced other large orders from solar developers, including a 4 GW order from Silicon Ranch, a 1.5 GW order from SoftBank subsidiary SB Energy Global, and a commitment from Lightsource bp and bp to procure 5.4 GW.
