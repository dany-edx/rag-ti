The investment agreements will fund the rollout of two Masdar-managed PV projects and one onshore wind project with a total combined capacity of 1 GW.
The contracts are claimed to be part of the first phase of a 10 GW renewable energy project pipeline in Azerbaijan.
In a press release, Azerbaijan’s Minister of Energy, Pavriz Shahbazov, said the announcement mirrors the current government’s prioritization of renewable energy development. The statement did not specify where the projects would be located, what technology would be utilized or when the projects would be commissioned.
The contracts were signed at the inauguration of the 230 MW Garadagh Solar Park in Garadagh, located in Azerbaijan's Baku region. The project, touted as the largest PV plant in the area, is also managed by Masdar.
Azerbaijan aims to generate more than 30% of its overall energy capacity from renewables by 2030.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) estimates Azerbaijan’s solar potential is 8 GW. However, very little solar has actually been rolled out in the country. Only 30 MW of solar capacity was deployed at the end of 2020, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Its approach is driven by expectations of faster market development.
“What we don't know is how the potential offtakers will react to cost information they receive on the market,” Langon said. “But we see that the hydrogen market is developing very quickly … refurbishing wind farms and increasingly solar farms will be good opportunities for us.”
Lhyfe deploys modular 100% green industrial hydrogen production plants for mobility and industry. The company inaugurated its first green hydrogen production in Vendée, western France, in 2022.
“We are already producing hydrogen and delivering to customers,” said Langon.
Lhyfe's next project to be commissioned is in France. It has signed a 16-year electricity supply contract in the country with VSB Energies Nouvelles for the Buléon wind farm. Lhyfe Bretagne will take 100% of the green electricity.
“We need to secure [power purchase agreement] with potential producers, with VSB being one of them,” Langon said. The 2-ton-per-day project is the second one to become operational.
Lhyfe has three sites under construction in France, including one extension. There are three more projects in Germany and one in Sweden. The new production sites will have a combined installed capacity of 5 MW to 10 MW. The hydrogen company also signed a 15-year corporate PPA with Kallista Energy, with the contract including the commissioning of a repowered wind park by mid-2024. 
Lhyfe is exploring offshore wind with its first R&D project, the Sealhyfe facility in the Atlantic Ocean. It's the world's first offshore hydrogen production facility, featuring a single wind turbine.
“The Hope project in Belgium is the natural continuation,” said Langon.
The company sees potential in using solar energy for hydrogen production because it offers slightly lower electricity costs compared to wind parks, in line with Lhyfe's focus on co-locating electricity and hydrogen production.
“Solar is positive in this regard,” he said.
Lhyfe aims to secure power purchase agreements involving a range of renewable sources to align with electricity production and consumption, meet EU regulations, and achieve cost efficiency, as wind and solar energy are slightly cheaper.
“We still can't rule out hydropower, but in general, a mix of renewables is the way forward,” he said.
According to Langon, Lhyfe is lobbying European and national authorities to develop hydrogen project subsidies.
“We are at the beginning of the market, and we need to decrease costs. We can't do that without subsidies,” he said.
Langon said schemes are needed to incentivize production and construction, but without these subsidies, there will not be “big plants in Europe.”

This SWCNT, a twisted graphene sheet hollow cylinder, enhances hole transport within the cell. The researchers surrounded the nanotube with lead sulfide colloidal quantum dots (PbS-CQDs).
“The mentioned materials can absorb sunlight well and in turn increase absorption and carriers' generation in the structure, thereby increasing the power conversion efficiency,” said the researchers. “In addition, since the carriers’ lifetime in PbS-CQDs material is close to 2000 ns, this causes less recombination of electrons and holes in the structure, which in turn leads to the increase of open-circuit voltage in the system.”
The researchers constructed the cell using a carbon contact, with the SWCNT serving as the hole transport layer (HTL). The cell's structure includes an absorber using MAPbI3 perovskite material, a titanium dioxide (TiO2) electron transfer layer (ETL), and a top contact composed of indium tin oxide (ITO).
“After finding the optimal length of SWCNT and HTL height, we start to sweep the center-to-center distance (CCD) between nanotubes of adjacent unit cells from 5 nm to 30 nm,” the researchers said. “The band gap of the selected SWCNT with the mentioned characteristics is equal to 1.3 eV.”
The research team determined that the optimal cell configuration and performance resulted from PbS-CQDs fully surrounding the SWCNT, with the HTL height set at 800 nm.
This final cell design, supported by simulations, achieved a 19.98% power conversion efficiency, an open-circuit voltage of 0.94 V, a short-circuit current density of 24.45 mA/cm², and an 86% fill factor, addressing perovskite stability concerns for potential industry use.
The study, “Single-walled carbon nanotube as hole transport layer in perovskite solar cell: Efficiency enhancement,” was recently published in Energy Reports.

In a recently published academic paper, the researchers defined these neighborhoods as virtual entities that use stored datasets of monitored solar and energy variables. This includes solar energy production, solar energy gains, solar energy potential, level of illuminance and sunlight exposure with specific decision-making tools. “A solar neighborhood is primarily a neighborhood, hence an urbanized area either with a single function or with a mix of human activities and, in which the full and optimal exploitation of the sun is prioritized,” the paper said.
“The article aims to identify the existing barriers and challenges in solar energy planning and to present the most common strategies, methods, and approaches for solar neighborhood planning and design through the insights from developers, architects, consultants, researchers, urban planners, municipalities, and other institutions.”
The future development of such neighborhoods is dependent on enhanced research on several topics, the paper adds. Topics include the ability to create more reliable and detailed digital twins of buildings and cities, as well as digital simulations that allow for better assessments of neighborhoods before breaking ground.
“Many aspects are expected to be facilitated in the years to come by a broader digitalization of the building environment, supported by an extensive application of the Internet of Things (IoT), co-simulation approaches, advanced computer, and orchestration of real monitored data,” the paper said. “The combination of high level of detail (LoD) models of urban surfaces and high-resolution data can pave the way for digital twin platforms to conduct real-time solar analysis with multiple goals.”
To combat this, scientists have heightened the need to implement high LoD models for vegetation elements, urban furniture and architectural features of buildings and neighborhoods. They also highlighted the need to implement the dynamic behavior of the environment – such as snow reflection – into the simulations.
The researchers called for developing simulations for emerging surface treatments and technologies. This includes electrochromic windows, retroreflective coatings and thermochromic substrates. “They have implications within the complex urban phenomena such as overshadowing effects and solar inter-building reflections,” the paper said.

The research group has also stressed in the paper the need for better aesthetic solutions to support the social acceptance of solar neighborhoods. They also recommend the development of business models for solar neighborhoods to ensure their long-term viability and the promotion of legal reforms to support these processes.
A legislative agenda supporting solar neighborhoods, they claim in the research, needs to include incentives and subsidies for the adoption of solar technologies, especially passive ones. It should also include regulations that will streamline the development and standardization of measurement and certificates. In addition, the research group highlighted the need for guidelines for architectural design that balances aesthetics with solar technology deployment and collaboration between local governments, businesses and communities.
The planning strategies were presented in the study “Ten questions concerning planning and design strategies for solar neighborhoods,” published in Building and Environment. As its headline suggests, it deals with ten different aspects of solar neighborhood development.
The research team comprises scientists from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the University of Savoy Mont Blanc, Italy’s Institute for Renewable Energy, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland, Concordia University, Lund University and the Australian PV Institute.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/27/storm-babet-costs-uk-germany-netherlands-over-422-93gwh/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,EUROPE",,"OCTOBER 27, 2023","Storm Babet costs UK, Germany, Netherlands over 422.93GWh","Behind-the-meter solar production plummeted across the UK, Netherlands and Germany from Oct. 19-20 last week due to the impact of Storm Babet.
Clouds from large storms like Babet can reduce irradiance locations to less than 10% of clear sky conditions. This decreases generation from solar assets and can cause large net grid demand. This is because residential inverters increasingly raw power from the grid instead of rooftop assets.
The Solcast analysis includes data from grid-scale assets, behind-the-meter generation estimates and Solcast’s Grid Aggregation model data. It also utilizes algorithms trained on global irradiance data and grid data to estimate the aggregate behind-the-meter capacity in grid load zones.
The scale of the impact across these countries underscores the critical need for proactive management by grid operators. As residential solar markets mature, the grid impact of rooftop solar becomes more significant. Large weather events like Storm Babet need to be proactively managed by grid operators to ensure stability.
 

 
After a relatively sunny start to the week, Storm Babet covered the hemisphere in clouds and rippled behind-the-meter generation for Thursday and Friday. As can be seen from the above GHI image, large areas received almost no irradiance, at or below 1kWh/m^2 for the day, from Northern Ireland to Lithuania.
In the UK for Tuesday, total solar, including behind-the-meter generation, was 34 GWh. It dropped to 10-15 GWh from Wednesday to Friday. Germany has more residential solar capacity and dropped from 112 GWh to below 30 GWh during the storm. The 50hertz TSO region in eastern Germany saw the largest relative drop, with Friday receiving just 4.5 GWh – 11% of Wednesday’s 40.2 GWh.
 

 
In the Netherlands, due to the smaller land area and more concentrated effects of the storm, the drop was particularly sharp. Friday recorded 7.1GWh, which is 92% down from 92.1GWh earlier in the week.
Forecasts based on aggregated models, such as the one used here, are used by grid operators to plan requirements for responsive power dispatch. This is typically through storage, hydro, or most commonly fossil or biomass gas generation.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with a typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/27/new-technique-may-speed-up-development-of-ultra-high-temperature-thermophotovoltaics/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES,VIRGINIA",LIOR KAHANA,"OCTOBER 27, 2023",New method for high-temperature thermophotovoltaic development,"A group of scientists from the University of California and the University of Richmond in the United States has created high-temperature stable emitters that can reach temperatures of over 1,800 C and may reportedly enable “the next generation of record efficiency lab-scale TPV systems.”
“Our finding presents a novel pathway for designing photonic structures that can operate at ultra-high temperatures and could enable,” the researchers said. “All that while simultaneously paving the way for their commercialization due to the reduced complexity of the structures.”
Solar thermophotovoltaics (STPV) is a power generation technology that utilizes thermal radiation to generate electricity in a photovoltaic cell. An STPV system consists of a thermal emitter that can reach high temperatures, near or beyond 1,000 C, and a photovoltaic diode cell that is able to absorb the photons coming from this heat source.
This technology has raised a strong interest among scientists in the past decades, as it is able to capture sunlight in the entire solar spectrum and has the technical potential to beat the Shockley-Queisser limit of traditional photovoltaics. The efficiencies reported so far, however, are still too low to make it commercially mature, as STPV devices still suffer from a series of optical and thermal losses.
The group combined 2,809 coating/substrate pairs and calculated the ideal photonic emitters. Those emitters have a tailored emission spectrum for TVP purposes, while also maintaining thermal stability in temperatures beyond 1,800 C. It also examined the combination of 53 materials with melting points above 2,000 C.
The scientists calculated then the heat-input-to-power-output efficiency of the combinations of all of those materials as either substrate or emitter coatings. They also marked the combinations with phase equilibria and low thermal expansion mismatches.
“Phase equilibria define whether the combined solid materials can co-exist until melting without forming a solid solution or an intermediate compound,” the academics explained in the paper.
Thermal expansion mismatches refer to the differences in how materials expand or contract when exposed to temperature changes.
The research group analyzed the emitters with different TPV cells based on different configurations: indium, gallium, arsenic and antimony (InGaAsSb); indium, gallium and arsenic (InGaAs); germanium (Ge); gallium and antimony (GaSb); and crystalline silicon (Si).
The academics found that the most promising combinations under inert environment applications were those based on InGaAsSb, with an emitter made of a Hafnium diboride (e-HfB2) substrate and a 144 nm thick boron nitride (BN) coating. The STPV cell is able to generate 19.8 W/cm2 of power.
“Our results illustrate that design choices that have enhanced emitter-to-cell spectral matching, via thin films, can lead to a substantial gain in performance, enabling a figure-of-merit (FOM) of over 45% for InGaAsSb-, InGaAs-, Ge-, and GaSb-based TPV system and 33% for practical Si cells,” they stated in the paper.
The research has also tested the emitters in vacuum conditions. The aim was to avoid sublimation or degradation of the bilayer emitter under high temperatures. In a vacuum, one of the most promising combinations was of an InGaAsSb TPV cell and emitter made of HfB2 as a substrate and a 416 nm coating of boron carbide (B4C). The FOM in this case reached 46.7% and the electrical power generated by the cell was 7.52 W/cm2.
“Our framework also demonstrates the possibility of designing metamaterials for specific applications in high-temperature photonics via optimization and machine learning,” the researchers concluded. “We foresee this strategy enabling a pathway for TPV with >50% power conversion efficiency and applications to other high-temperature systems and thermal devices with improved functionality and stability.”
Their findings were presented in the study “Photonics roadmap for ultra-high-temperature thermophotovoltaics,” published this month in Joule.

With falling upstream prices and weak demand in China with its key export markets these are the lowest prices ever recorded, according to OPIS data.
Upstream prices across the supply chain in China continue to slide, weighing on module prices. China polysilicon prices extended losses by falling 3.33 yuan/kg, or 4.19%, to 76.17 yuan/kg this week. The wafer and cell segments saw prices fall for a third consecutive week, with Mono G12 cells seeing a 10.45% plummet to $0.0703/wp. Buyers and sellers of modules alike reported lower prices during OPIS’ weekly market survey. P-type modules are on the threshold of 1 yuan/W, while n-type modules are a little more than 0.10 yuan/W higher, a developer said.

Sentiment in China remains bearish. While domestic demand will come from fourth-quarter installations, this is typically a low-demand period, concurred multiple sources. As available land for projects is decreasing, demand will not be as high as hoped, one module manufacturer explained. Orders signed last quarter have been cancelled and buyers want to re-sign contracts at current low prices, another module manufacturer said. The supply picture is gloomy, too, as China’s module manufacturers are sitting on 1-2 months of inventory, according to one seller.
China’s key export markets continue to struggle, with inventories in the European distributed market so large that there’s “basically no need to replenish supply,” according to one source. Even with low prices, approvals for ground-mounted projects are slow and there is insufficient labor to set up projects, they said. Over in Latin America, Brazil’s market is also facing weakness. Brazil is “hoarding too much” inventory, a seller said.
Looking ahead, module prices are expected to continue falling as we reach the end of the year, OPIS learned during its weekly market survey. Many sources pointed to how the 1 yuan/W era has arrived already, with a recent major China procurement tender seeing P-type module bids of as low as 0.993 yuan/W. There is “brutal competition” coming, and “industry consolidation may see more momentum,” according to one solar market veteran.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

Sydney-based MPower has signed a master supply agreement with Trina Solar for the supply of solar panels and trackers as part of plans to develop a portfolio of more than 30 solar farms and battery energy storage assets across Australia’s eastern states.
MPower Chief Executive Officer Nathan Wise said the agreement with Trina Solar covers the first five mid-scale solar farms. The projects form part of the company’s planned wider rollout of grid-connected renewable energy assets with total capacity of more than 200 MW.
“With this partnership, MPower can accelerate the rollout of its build-own-operate strategy with best-in-class components and technology, and build additional traction in what is shaping up as a multi-billion dollar addressable market opportunity,” Wise said.
Under the agreement, Trina has agreed to supply an initial 39.5 MWp of solar modules and 31.2 MWp of TrinaTracker Vanguard 1P trackers before the end of 2024.
The modules are the large format Vertex N bifacial module with iTOPCon (NEG21C.20) and the Vertex bifacial module (DEG21C.20).
Andrew Gilhooly, Trina’s head of utility solutions and storage for Asia Pacific, said the MPower agreement is the first deal in Australia to include both panels and trackers, and will give the developer greater certainty over product supply and pricing.
“The innovative contract structure under this arrangement enables MPower to navigate pricing uncertainty on modules and trackers with confidence over a prolonged implementation timescale, where individual project characteristics on the entire portfolio of sites may initially be unknown or uncertain,” he said. “For the sub-5 MW segment in Australia this is important, as it enables them to scale quickly and successfully execute more projects within a more expedient time frame.”
MPower has already started construction on a 5 MW solar farm in Narromine in central New South Wales, the first of the mid-scale projects the company intends to build across the grid.
Other projects in MPower’s development pipeline include a shovel-ready 5 MW solar project at Faraday in Victoria and a ready-to-build 5 MW solar farm with a 5 MW/10 MWh battery storage project at Kadina in South Australia.

American Battery Factory has broken ground on its lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) battery cell gigafactory in Tucson, Arizona. The gigafactory will provide an estimated 1,000 jobs. The company is investing $1.2 billion to open the factory. 
The global market for lithium batteries is expected to reach $105 billion by 2025, as demand is expected to continue to accelerate. Increased renewable energy and electrification of transportation and the home is slated to drive this sharp increase in demand.
American Battery Factory’s gigafactory will be a site for both LFP cell production and further research and development opportunities. The factory is being built using Sprung Instant Structures’ rapid modular construction model. The R&D center and initial factory module are expected to be constructed by 2025.
The company has recently expanded its executive leadership team, adding former Major General John Kem as president and Dr. Jun Liu as chief scientist. The company has also secured strategic partnerships with companies like Celgard, Anovion and FNA Group.
“With this transformational investment, American Battery Factory advances Arizona’s clean energy industry,” said Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs.
Several clean energy companies have found a home in Arizona, including First Solar, TPI Composites, KORE Power and ElectraMeccanica.
Clean Energy Associates says that the global battery market will grow by 186% by 2025 from 2022 production totals of 1,706 GWh.
