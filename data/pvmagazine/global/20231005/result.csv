Malakoff, a major independent power producer (IPP) based in Kuala Lumpur, has signed a memorandum of understanding with MMC Group to potentially provide 500 MW of solar capacity. Malakoff will be responsible for development, installation, operation, and maintenance, while MMC Ports will be the end user.
The deal is aligned with Malaysia's increasing focus on renewable technologies, as evidenced by initiatives like the Large-Scale Solar (LSS) Procurement Scheme.
In the Philippines, Citicore, a renewables company based in San Juan City, has entered into a one-year PPA with Clark Electric Distribution Corp (CEDC). Under the PPA, Citicore will supply the utility with 7.5 MW from two power plants located in Tarlac, central Luzon, with a combined capacity of 15 MW.
The agreement is expected to expand into a 10-year contract once Citicore's 60 MW Bato solar plant in Zambales goes online. Citicore has plans for aggressive solar expansion, with four additional projects slated for development on Luzon Island.
The developments are supported by Citicore securing a $100 million loan from Singapore-based debt financing firm Pentagreen Capital, with a portion of the funding allocated for the construction of solar plants in Batangas, in the country's north.
The Philippines aims to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030, with a focus on minigrids and standalone clean power systems due to the country's archipelagic nature, according to a 2022 report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

The Ministry of Energy of Luxembourg has allocated 52.7 MW of PV capacity across 14 projects in the country's first tender for agrivoltaic projects. The tender was originally supposed to allocate 50 MW. The selected projects will spread across the country and will occupy a total surface of 73.5 hectares.
The Ministry of Energy noted significant diversity in the use of agricultural land for solar projects. They have designated such facilities for deployment on meadows used for fodder or grass production, pastures accommodating cattle, sheep, chickens, and Iberian pigs, as well as arable land with crop rotation and an orchard hosting laying hens.
Among the 14 selected projects, eight will incorporate solar trackers, while one will feature a shade roof.
Although specific details regarding the final prices of the tender were not provided by the ministry, they emphasized that the selection process considered not only securing the best price but also factored in ecological and agricultural considerations. These considerations entail enhancing the ecological quality of the area through the project and maintaining agricultural usage of the area with the participation of an active farmer.
An essential criterion in this tender focused on promoting biodiversity through the photovoltaic systems. Patrick Witte from the project developer GPSS, which is directly involved in four of the 14 chosen schemes, noted the emphasis on increasing biodiversity in these agrivoltaic projects.
“For the first time in the history of photovoltaic tenders in Luxembourg, this tender was oversubscribed,” said Witte.
Priority was given to PV systems with output below 2 MW and various types of use, such as pasture and arable land.

Power producers have until Oct. 30 to submit their bids.
The projects are divided into four streams:
Lot 1: Off-grid solar PV systems ranging from 0.5 KW to 45 KW, with a 540 W minimum module requirement
Lot 2: An “All in Two” solar street lighting project that includes lanterns and torches
Lot 3: Solar power water pumping systems
Lot 4: On-ground PV systems with installed capacities ranging from 20 KW to 300 KW
The all-in-two solar street lighting system (Lot 2) necessitates an “LED luminary (LED, MPPT, and a battery of a specified capacity,” along with mono-crystalline or polycrystalline PV modules distributed on top of the lighting pole. It also requires “module mounting structures and brackets” to support load operation from dusk till dawn, as stated in the Lot 2 tender document.
For the solar power water pumping system (Lot 3), a module capacity of at least 540 W is mandatory, using mono-crystalline or polycrystalline half-cell and n-type PV panels, with bifacial technology being an acceptable option. The module voltage should not be less than 1,000 VDC, as outlined in this lot's tender document.
Regarding the final lot, the 20 KW to 300 KW on-grid or PV-diesel solar systems (Lot 4), a 540 W module capacity is required, comprising mono-crystalline or polycrystalline panels and half-cell n-type PV panels, according to the Lot 4 tender documents. The PV-diesel system controller should ensure a minimum load for the generators and “manage energy production from the solar inverters to maintain grid stability” during diesel generator operation.
All projects must be completed within 120 days from signing.
In December 2022, Abu Dhabi-based Masdar said it would build a 120 MW solar plant in Yemen – the country's first large-scale solar plant.
Yemen had 256.8 MW installed PV capacity at the end of 2022, according to the most recent data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
Solar became the primary energy source for Yemeni households after 2016, which was two years after the start of the now-tempered civil war, according to a recent paper by the Berlin-based Energy Access and Development Program (EADP). The paper reported 75% of Yemen's urban population and 50% of Yemen's rural population access solar energy.

Researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer ISE are investigating the impact that floating PV arrays have on lake ecosystems.
Together with the energy supplier Erdgas Südwest, the researchers are investigating the effects of a floating PV system deployed on a quarry pond in Leimershein, in the Rhineland-Palatinate state, southern Germany.
The company installed the 1.5 MW system on more than 6,500 floating structures hosting 3,744 solar panels. The lake is 18 hectares in size and around 8% of its surface is covered by the solar array.
The research team will permanently attach twelve sensors to the system and the lake around it. It wants to use the sensors to document the oxygen content, temperature, carbon dioxide content and the availability of various nutrients.
“Based on the results, we will be able to better determine what the perfect ratio between lake and facility area should be, in order to even achieve, in the best case, positive effects on water quality,” explained Fraunhofer ISE researcher Konstantin Ilgen. “Our previous measurements in the Renchen quarry lake suggest that with an area occupancy of up to 10%, hardly any effects on the lake are to be expected. This now needs to be underpinned.”
In May 2023, the researchers also examined the effects of the floating solar system in Renchen using stationary and mobile probes. It turned out that the system had little influence on the oxygen content or thermal stratification of the lake. However, the system only covers 2% of the water surface.
The Fraunhofer ISE team also found that the structure of the photovoltaic system prevented the wind from coming into contact with the water surface and therefore had no cooling effect. On the other hand, the modules shade the water surface and thus provide cooling.
The research project in Leimersheim is expected to deliver results in around two years.
Natural gas Südwest is supporting another research project on site. The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) is currently investigating the effects of the floating photovoltaic system on the biology of the quarry lake. Results are expected here in 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/05/a-survival-guide-for-solar-smes/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CHINA,EUROPE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 5, 2023",A survival guide for solar SMEs,"From pv magazine 09/23
This year, solar manufacturers have increased vertical integration and production capacity, and the global industry has attracted new entrants, buoyed by the market outlook and advancing technology. Infolink data shows annual module production capacity grew at an average of 30% to 40% from 2018 to 2022. That rate is expected to double this year, to an unprecedented 80%.

Technology and competition are driving expansion, prompting legacy manufacturers to modify production lines. For instance, passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) lines must have nine-busbar (BB) to 11 BB stringer machines upgraded to 16 BB devices, and have laminating temperatures controlled, to produce tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) modules. For heterojunction (HJT) production, busbarless cell interconnection requires dispenser equipment.
InfoLink expects that more than a terawatt of annual module production capacity will be reached this year. Inventory has already started stockpiling, driving buyers to wait. Quarterly module prices have fallen below manufacturer quotes and some solar companies have clawed back their overseas stock at the end of June, as underselling continued into early August.
Module-only manufacturers are thought to have experienced negative gross margins thanks to solar cell costs, and risk management strategy will be critical to survive in a competitive market.
Solar manufacturers with just a single business model will need a risk strategy as competition increases. SMEs could take advantage of flat organizational structures to show flexibility in equipment use and at a managerial decision-making level.
Manufacturers can utilize the production of medium and low-efficiency products to control costs while also accepting special-specification or, unbranded, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) orders to manage monthly output. This allows for efficient capacity utilization and the maintenance of a stable utilization rate, which can be lowered to regulate inventory level. Based on historical expense data, the average gross margin level for OEM and dual-channel distribution may be lower than for direct sales. During periods of high market volatility, however, maintaining conservative gross margins can provide flexibility in continuing minimum operational conditions.
As the industry moves toward competitive convergence on identical or similar module technology, product differentiation strategies will help SMEs by increasing module diversity and market opportunities to create demand. Using differentiated products, such as flexible thin-film and small-format specialty modules – to expand product ranges and cater to different applications based on customer need – can foster the development of potential markets.
In addition, diversification of suppliers and customers can reduce reliance on certain clients, suppliers, and markets. As regional risks have been steadily increasing in recent years, particularly within the volatile environment of the solar industry, SMEs could become vulnerable to market fluctuation. Expansion overseas and developing diversified products will help spread risk and build solid customer relationships to ensure long-term business cooperation.
Manufacturers can also adopt supply chain integration strategies to manage the manufacturing capability of their upstream and downstream segments. Such vertical integration enhances cost management capability and retains transaction space by having in-house production capacity of other segments, thereby maintaining flexibility and mitigating risk during periods of greater volatility. Taking the example of cell manufacturers expanding into module production, if the cell inventory cycle extends, in-house module capacity can consume a portion of the cell output, ensuring better risk control.
The significance of vertical integration is growing for manufacturers. This involves expanding into project development, system design, integrated products, and after-sales operation and maintenance services. Such an approach can effectively address product usage and consumption issues. Moreover, manufacturers can gain a better grasp of real-time market information downstream through collaboration with clients.
With sustainability requirements tightening – in the form of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) reporting guidelines set to become obligatory in the European Union and with new standards planned in the United States and internationally – PV manufacturers powered by non-renewable energy, for example, will face greater risk. At the same time, this will provide all players with more opportunities for differentiation. Manufacturers can seize this chance.
Long-term oversupply has become a key issue in the PV industry. Given the resource and financial constraints faced by SMEs, companies should deploy a combination of strategies to establish presence in a market that is marked by a convergence of competition. This includes exploring potential markets via differentiated products and adopting strategies such as OEM and dual-channel distribution to mitigate operational risk. With sustainability becoming a corporate imperative, manufacturers should also be prepared for future policy dynamics in regional markets, thereby seizing businesses opportunities. Adapting risk strategies will be a crucial factor for the survival of manufacturers with a single business model.

Gautam Solar is showcasing its n-type TOPCon solar modules this week at the Renewable Energy India (REI) Expo 2023.
The modules will be available in power ratings of 565 Wp to 580 Wp, with a maximum efficiency of 22.45%. These are designed for ground-mounted projects. They are certified according to UL and IEC standards and are already available for the US and European markets.
“Gautam Solar’s n-type TOPCon modules have a lower degradation rate of 1% in the first year and 0.4% in subsequent years unlike 2% in the first year and 0.55% in subsequent years for p-type modules. This increases the longevity of the solar modules. The module degrades only to 87.4% of its initial rated power at the end of 30 years compared to p-type modules which degrade to 84.8% in their 25 years lifecycle,” according to Gautam Solar. “In addition, Gautam Solar’s n-type modules also provide BOS cost savings of 3.26% and LCOE reduction of 1.56%.”
The modules are based on M10 cells and are composed of 144 half-cut cells produced using non-destructive cutting process for better low-light performance and negligible chances of micro-cracks. In addition, they feature multi-busbar design with round ribbon connectors for lower electrical losses and the better use of light.
Gautam Solar said the modules will be available in monofacial and bifacial variants, with the bifacials providing an additional 10% to 30% power from the rear side, depending on the installation conditions.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/05/novel-thin-film-anti-soiling-coating-increases-solar-module-yield-by-over-3/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 5, 2023",Novel thin-film anti-soiling coating increases solar module yield by over 3%,"Scientists from the Madison Area Technical College in the United States have tested superhydrophobic self-cleaning, anti-soiling coatings that, if applied to photovoltaic modules, can purportedly increase the panels' yield by over 3%.
The coatings are based on nanoparticle oxide suspensions developed by US-based Microporous Oxides Science and Technology, LLC (MOST), which specializes in the preparation of stable suspensions of nanoparticulate oxides for use as coatings on several substrates to produce self-assembled porous thin-films for a wide variety of applications.
The researchers tested, in particular, anti-soiling coatings created via spray deposition and sol-gel synthesis, a wet-chemical technique commonly utilized for the production of both glassy and ceramic materials. The coatings were made with a nanoparticulate suspension containing a mixture of titania, titanium oxide (TiO2), silica, silicon dioxide (SiO2) and metal oxides.
The advantage of using sol-gel synthesis is not using heat to make the coating adhere to the underlying glass cover of the PV module, which allows the films to consolidate, cure, bond, and harden upon exposure to sunlight in the field.
“Metal oxide thin films containing nanoparticulate photoactive materials such as titania are capable of sintering upon excitation from ultraviolet radiation,” the scientists explained. “This sunlight-induced UV sintering process serves to chemically bond the nanoparticles to one another, and to the solar PV module's glazing surface, rendering a durable thin film that is resistant to wear and dissolution.”
The research team coated the solar modules in an automotive collision repair spray booth with two different spray guns and nozzles. “After spraying, the modules were allowed to air dry in the spray booths, which were maintained at 15% relative humidity,” the scientists explained.
They then tested the coating on a PV system relying on eight 370 W south-oriented coated bifacial modules mounted with a tile angle of 10 degrees provided by Jordan-based Philadelphia Solar. Their performance was compared with that of eight uncoated reference panels of the same kind.
The field tests showed that soiling residues on the coated modules were thinner than those in the uncoated panels.
“Coated and uncoated solar modules also demonstrated significantly different wetting behavior in the field that was easily visible to the naked eye,” the research group said in the report. “Rain deposited on the uncoated panels tended to bead up, forming raised droplets on the surface. By comparison, rain on the coated panels tended to sheet, wetting a much larger portion of the panel's surface.”
The analysis showed that the coated panels achieved an annual power production of 1,097 kWh/kW, while the uncoated modules achieved a yield of 1,058 kWh/kW. “While a 3 to 3.5% energy gain may appear modest, improvements of this magnitude would be of significant financial importance to the industry,” the researchers said.
They also specified that the cost of thin film coating materials is approximately $80 per liter and estimated the cost per panel at about $2.6, which would represent an increase of about 1.4% in the total cost of the panel. “It appears clear that the MOST coatings tested in this study have strong potential to be a commercially viable product for solar manufacturing.”
The novel anti-soiling coating was presented in the study “Field tests of a self-sintering, anti-soiling, self-cleaning, nanoporous metal oxide, transparent thin film coating for solar photovoltaic modules,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
“As of August 2023, we have successfully coated modules from several different manufacturers, including Adani, Axitec, Crossroads, REC, Silfab, Trina and Yingli,” the scientists said referring to the future direction of their work. “We hope to report on field tests using those coated modules in the next year or two.”

Jakson has unveiled n-type dual-glass solar panels based on TOPCon technology. The JN-590W model offers peak power output of 590 W (under standard temperature conditions) and an efficiency of 22.86%.
The module is built with M10 half cells and 16 busbars. It offers bifacial gain of up to 25% with the module capable of energy generation with both direct and reflected sunlight. The bifaciality factor is 80±5%. The module measures 2,278×1,133×35 mm in size and weighs 33 kg. It can operate within a temperature range of -40 C to 85 C .
Anurag Garg, COO of the solar business at Jakson, told pv magazine that there is a growing focus on TOPCon technology among Indian manufacturers. Garg said that the price gap (INR/Wp) between TOPCon and mono PERC modules is shrinking, making TOPCon technology more attractive. These modules offer higher output within the same size footprint. Additionally, manufacturers that produce mono PERC cells can transition to TOPCon cell production with specific enhancements and adjustments to their existing production lines.
Garg expects TOPCon technology to take a leading position in the market by the end of the next year. However, mono PERC modules will continue to coexist for a certain period, similar to the transition from polycrystalline technology.
Jakson is expanding its module manufacturing capacity to 1.2 GW by adding a 600 MW production line. This new line will manufacture glass-glass mono PERC and TOPCon modules featuring up to 16 busbars.

Those based on perovskites have proved particularly attractive to researchers working in photovoltaics, having already demonstrated efficiencies beyond 16%.
With this in mind, a group of scientists led by the Islamic Azad University in Iran has conducted a series of simulations to investigate the potential for colloidal perovskite quantum dot (PQD) solar cells to achieve higher efficiencies than those reported to date. They sought to assess, in particular, if the properties of the perovskite absorber can be varied and modulated to enhance the cell performance.
The research team conducted a series of simulations on a 14.61%-efficient PQD cell based on all-inorganic cesium-lead iodide (CsPbI3) perovskite, which is also known as black perovskite.
They assumed a cell configuration based on an indium tin oxide substrate, an electron transport layer (ETL) relying on tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), a CsPbI3 absorber mixed with a layer of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and a CsPbI3 absorber mixed with the QDs. It also included a precursor film made of PTB polymer, molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), and gold (Au).
In the simulations, the research group modified the CsPbI3 properties by considering the material ratio, the deposition processes used, a range of different treatments, the use of nanoparticles such as graphene, and the utilization of stacked deposition with different sandwich materials.
The analysis showed that the absorber layer materials must have an energy bandgap between 1 eV and 1.7 eV, as well as an electron affinity of 3.7 eV and 4 eV. It also assessed the effect of electron and hole mobility on cell performance and found that hole mobility has a significant impact.
“For fabrication of QD solar cells with high efficiency we need an absorber layer with high mobility,” the academics stated, adding that the ideal thickness of the perovskite absorbers should be between 100 nm and 350 nm.
An optimized version of the analyzed solar cell showed a potential power conversion efficiency of 29.88%. They said their results may help other researchers to work on CsPbI3 materials for the achievement of highly efficient, stable, large-scale, and flexible PQDs solar cells.
They presented their findings in the study “Comprehensive guidance for optimizing the colloidal quantum dot (CQD) Perovskite solar cells: experiment and simulation,” published in scientific reports.

“Europe imported roughly 78 GW in the first eight months of 2023, already surpassing what will be installed this year by a good margin,” said Marius Mordal Bakke, senior supply chain analyst at Rystad Energy. “While import data is not currently available past August of this year, the module surplus as of August would have increased to around 80 GW. Unless we see a considerable slowdown in shipments into Europe this number could surpass 100 GW by the end of this year.”
He explained that the utility-scale and rooftop installation share in Europe should be around or between 45%—55% in 2023. “With already high inventory levels in warehouses, mainly residential and C&I, the majority of new imports would likely be for utility-scale projects,” he added. “With import volumes averaging around 10 GW per month from March to August this year, a good portion of these modules will inevitably end up in European warehouses.”
Mordal Bakke said that while most of the stored modules will be for the rooftop PV segments and not large-scale utility projects, which often procure their PV modules directly from the manufacturer, the industry will see n-type modules taking up a larger share of the residential and C&I market. “The year-on-year decline in average PERC and TOPCon prices are fairly similar, while the low-end prices of PERC in Europe could signify an effort to clear stock of the less in-demand p-type modules,” he said. “One would expect the PERC/TOPCon proportion in European warehouses to approach the shipment share of n/p-type towards the end of the year.”
As prices are dropping with seemingly no relief in sight, PV modules purchased and placed in warehouses are losing value every day. “PERC modules bought and stored by a European distributor for $0.23/W back in March are facing an average spot price of $0.16/W today, which could very likely be $0.15/W next month, meaning that one would be incentivized to accept lower bids to clear stock before it loses too much of its value,” Mordal Bakke emphasized.
In the September issue of pv magazine, we examine booming solar markets in Brazil and Mexico; investigate whether TOPCon modules really are more susceptible to degradation than PERC products; attempt to unravel how US solar manufacturers can qualify for domestic content bonuses under the Inflation Reduction Act; and look at how homeowners can achieve the residential solar, battery, and EV dream.
The analyst noted that both distributors of manufacturers operating their own warehouses in Europe may be affected by pressure on prices. “Both are affected in the way that they would want to clear stock before the ‘old' modules lose too much value, while also making room for new generation n-type modules that are more in-demand and rapidly becoming more price competitive with PERC,” he said. “The price gap between module products from different manufacturers has increased recently, mainly due to different strategic choices. While some manufacturers choose to lower production output in the face of oversupply and falling prices, other producers value their annual shipment volumes, reducing their offer prices and squeezing the gross profit to expand their market share.”
Rystad Energy estimated the total value of the 40 GW of modules stored in mid-July was around €7 billion ($7.3 billion), according to a report released at that time. “With current price levels, however, these would now be worth around €6 billion,” Mordal Bakke said.

Developers of large-scale solar projects located near residential areas are used to backlash from residents, who often claim that homes near utility-scale solar projects will diminish in value. This was found to not be the case, according to a study commissioned by Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation (CTEI) in partnership with the Advanced Power Alliance and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
The residential market study was conducted in areas surrounding six utility-scale solar plants located in four Texas counties: Tom Green, Bell, Lamar, and Bee Counties. Sales were analyzed at varying stages of the project, including announcement and construction. The market trend analysis showed no evidence of negative market impacts for nearby residential properties, and revealed a robust and competitive market for homes near the solar plants both during construction and once they are operational.
“This first-of-its-kind study on solar energy and property values underscores what we know to be true in Texas – utility scale solar projects have a positive impact on our local economies,” said Matt Welch, State Director of CTEI. “As Texas continues to lead on renewable energy, it is crucial our leaders have access to objective data to help dispel misinformation and false narratives.”
To define what a utility-scale solar project is, the report authors turned to definitions from SEIA and the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). SEIA defines utility-scale as solar projects generating over 1 MW of solar energy and NREL’s definition is more than 5 MW of solar energy. The report authors also noted that utility-scale projects typically sell electricity directly to the grid as opposed to supplying electricity to an individual facility.
The study set out to look at sales metrics of homes in areas surrounding typical utility-scale installations. The sales metrics include price per interior square foot, sales to price list ratios and days on market and these were compared in areas close to the solar projects to sales located further from solar projects, and findings show that sales prices and marketing times of residential properties located near solar projects were generally consistent with residential sales further away.
“As the market for solar and other renewable energy production grows, it is important to understand how their presence impacts surrounding communities,” said Erin Kiella, PhD., lead author of the report. “Studying these projects using market data helps bring clarity on these issues.”
The study comes at a time when solar is booming in Texas, the state that is number one in solar development in the United States, with many large utility-scale projects coming online.. A 36 GW buildout is expected by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) over the next five years, building on the roughly 16 GW that is active to date.

The novel technique utilizes Pinch Analysis, which identifies the optimal temperature levels for heat exchange within a system, and provides the coordinates for the optimal design and sizing of the heat pumps.
“In Pinch Analysis, most approaches to design the heat recovery system as well as the utility system are based on a single operating point or a couple of operating points. In the past, this was due to the lack of temporally detailed process data,” the researchers explained. “However, the available process data is expected to increase drastically by the use of transient process simulation models.”
The researchers used software simulation to obtain detailed process data and utilized 8,759 time slices over one year, calculating an optimal set of heat pump parameters by mathematical optimization. For their case study, they chose an automotive paint shop, where variations in heating and cooling demands primarily arise from weather conditions.
The novel methodology considers different economic optimization objectives and is intended to minimize Opex over the whole year and maximize the net present value (NPV) of the heat pump investment. It also aims to maximize the internal rate of return (IRR) of the heat pump investment.
The scientists compared the performance of a system designed with the novel approach with that of a system conceived with the time average (TAM) model, as well as with that of a system based on an optimization method that considers the entire annual process data as well as NPV and IRR.
.“The TAM averages the heat loads over the batch period and allows for basic targeting,” the academics explained, noting that this configuration achieved a coefficient of performance (COP) of 2.56. “The integration of the TAM heat pump can already provide Opex savings of 1.75% but has very high Capex due to its large heating capacity. With an IRR of 18.4% and an NPV of €167,183 ($175,433), it is already a very worthwhile investment.”
The system designed with the novel technique, by contrast, achieved Opex savings of 3.94%, an IRR of 56.3% and an NPV of €610,15. Its COP was 2.41. When optimized to NPV, the novel method showed Opex savings of 3.93%, an IRR of 60%, an NPV of €615,989 and a COP of 2.48. Finally, when optimized for IRR, the OPEX savings were 2.93%, the IRR was 70.5%, the NPV was €476,556 and the COP was 3.17.
The scientists claim that, by utilizing the new methodology, a 33% smaller heat pump could be integrated. “The smaller size and greater savings show particularly in the evaluation of the profitability of the investments,” they concluded.
They presented their findings in the study “Heat pump integration in non-continuous industrial processes by Dynamic Pinch Analysis Targeting,” published in Applied Energy. The research group was formed by scientists from the German Aerospace Center and the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.

Negotiations for the sale of BayWa re's PV distribution unit, Solar Trade – first announced in March 2023 – are still ongoing. Candidate selection is now underway, and a decision could be reached early next year, potentially leading to a sale in 2025.
Given Solar Trade's substantial valuation, the buyer may come from a sector unrelated to distribution. BayWa re is pursuing this sale as part of a strategic shift to focus on its role as an independent power producer (IPP), with the aim of financing a threefold increase in project volume by 2026 and expanding its IPP portfolio to 3 GW.
Once under new ownership, Solar Trade aims to scale up and tap into growth opportunities in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Asia-Pacific (APAC), and the Americas, with the goal of exceeding 10 GW in annual sales of solar modules and inverters to align with global photovoltaic market trends.
“Our activities continue with the reliability, financial solidity and competence that have always guided us to support our customers,” said Julien Chirol, president of BayWa re's French subsidiary Solar Systems SAS. “This new buyer will provide an impetus for growth and will allow us to continue our development in our respective markets including France.”
In France, the workforce of the BayWa re Solar Systems subsidiary has doubled in two years to reach 100 people today, with 10 new positions currently open for recruitment.

German PV module manufacturer Aleo Solar has presented an upgraded version of its Leo Sol in-roof PV modules. The 108 half-cell modules, featuring black back film, come in four power classes, ranging from 385 W to 400 W.
The most powerful variant has an efficiency of 20% and a short-circuit current of up to 13.18 A. The voltage at the maximum power point (MPP) is 31.79 V. Under low-light conditions of 200 W per square meters, the module is still able to produce 77 W, according to the company. The temperature coefficient is -0.34% per degree Celsius.
The modules can be integrated into rooftops using the Solrif in-roof system from Ernst Schweizer AG. They also be used as solar roof tiles.
The new products enable the combination of modules from the smaller, older version within the same string, allowing for full roof area utilization with a uniform design. The Solrif system offers “blind modules” for covering corners, edges, and areas around dormers and chimneys.
Aleo Solar said that the frameless modules have a self-cleaning feature due to their free lower edge, requiring minimal maintenance. The “Leo Sol” module is certified according to IEC 61215 and 61730, capable of withstanding snow loads of up to 8,100 Pascal and wind loads of up to 3,600 Pascal. It also holds certifications for resistance to flying fire, radiant heat, and hailstones up to 40 mm in hail protection class 4.
Furthermore, the module is resistant to potential-induced degradation (PID) and light-induced degradation (LID) and has passed the AgNP test against snail traces. Aleo Solar provides a 25-year product and performance guarantee, with performance guaranteed at 85.12% of the original efficiency after 25 years.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/05/netherlands-raises-solar-panel-recycling-fee-to-create-market-shock-resistant-guarantee-fund/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",ANGELA SKUJINS,"OCTOBER 5, 2023",Netherlands raises solar panel recycling fee to ‘absorb shocks’ in market,"On July 1, the Dutch legislation on solar panel recycling changed and imposed importers selling solar panels to Netherlands' clients to pay a recycling fee of €40 ($42.50) per ton – a massive jump from the previous €6.50 per ton fee.
PV module importers are expected to pay this fee until 2025 to the OPEN Foundation, a Dutch nongovernmental organization.
Jan-Willem Jehee, operations manager at Stichting Zonne-energie Recycling Nederland (ZRN), today told pv magazine that the organization, which advocates for solar stakeholders and works with the OPEN Foundation, wanted to “offer some transparency” around the schedule change.
“We had a change where usually it's €6.50 ($6.98) per ton put on the market for solar module [and] that increased to €40 – so that's a sixfold increase as of July 1 this year. Where does this €40 come from? What are we doing with the money? That kind of stuff we want to clarify,” he said.
The organization hosted a public consultation last week answering questions about the fee change, which fits in with the European Union’s Netherlands’ 2014-mandated Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive. The directive aims to minimize the block's electrical and electronic waste.
Another policy change ZRN wanted to provide information about was the new warranty fund or security deposit, also mandated as part of the Netherlands’ 2014 WEEE Directive, Jeehee said. “You need to offer security, that as a producer you are able to pay for recycling in the future,” he explained.
“The WEEE says the way you're importing, or if you're bringing a solar module into a market in Europe, you're responsible to collect it when it becomes waste, and to make sure it's recycled when it comes to waste,” he added. “What we're doing in the Netherlands is we are introducing this guarantee fund, which is basically a fund with money aimed to absorb shocks in the market should one occur.”
Asked if he expects shocks to the market, Jehee answered: “In the coming 20 years, for sure.” He added there may be many “uncertainties” which will buck assumptions, surrounding demand and therefore price, but it is expected one day there will be, “less market growth than what is anticipated.”
“If you're talking about an increase of your waste streams, we will have large guarantees of solar modules for 25 years, sometimes 30 years, but that's the technical lifetime,” Jehee said. “You don't know the economical lifetime. You don't know, for instance, when a household will be ready to replace old modules installed in 2010 with a new version. We have a belief of what it will be, but it might turn out to be different.”
What Jehee is confident of is that if there is exponential growth of solar uptake – as there is estimated to be – then treatment and recycling fees are expected to grow exponentially to match. This is where the security deposit comes in. “In order to be able to offer this stable pricing, we say we're going to set some money apart in a fund, and this is this guarantee fund,” he said.
ZRN collected feedback from solar stakeholders until the end of last week about their initial thoughts on the fund and plan on publishing results from the public consultation “soon,” Jehee said. There will be one more round allowing stakeholders to give further feedback before the body submits their recommendations to the OPEN Foundation, which will make the final ruling.
Jehee expects the guarantee fund to be ready between the end of this year and sometime next year.
He said at present there was not enough solar waste to warrant treatment facilities in the Netherlands, with low volumes transported and managed outside the country adhering to Dutch law. “How will it be done in the future when waste streams start growing? Of course, it will be different,” Jeehee said.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimated there would be more than 78 million tonnes of cumulative PV waste material by 2050, the organization said in 2016.
Recycling or repurposing solar PV panels at the end of their roughly 30-year lifetime can generate an estimated stock of 78 million tonnes of raw materials and other valuable components globally by 2050, the report added. “If fully injected back into the economy, the value of the recovered material could exceed $15 billion by 2050.”

Spanish startup Soleolico has designed a hybrid wind-PV system for power generation.
“After more than 10 years of research, an investment of more than €5 million ($5.2 million) and the evolution of more than 30 prototypes, Soleolico is the first wind turbine in the world that integrates photovoltaic panels in its blades,” the company said in a statement.  “The blades are oriented to the wind using a patented magnetic system that calibrates the wind orientation of each blade to extract maximum energy.”
The product is available for distributed generation, but also for transmission lines and large-scale applications, said the manufacturer.
It features solar panels from Spanish company Izpitek, a unit of Tecnalia, which manufactures photovoltaic modules that can be fully integrated into lightweight components.
The system is also coated with Pure.Tech, which Soleolico claims is a revolutionary material that eliminates greenhouse gases, as it absorbs CO2.
Soleolico said its new solution is robust, scalable and is available “at a low price.”
Seville-based engineering company Alener, Spanish metal structure make Imedexsa, and Talleres JM López, a producer of pipes and equipment for the petrochemical industry, have supported Soleolico in the design and construction of the system.
