Those are the key findings in a report from the International Energy Agency.
Climate pledges by governments to date – even if fully achieved – would fall “well short” of what is needed to bring global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to net zero by 2050, according to the report, Net Zero by 2050: a Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector.
The report sets what it described as a “cost-effective and economically productive” pathway resulting in an energy economy “dominated by renewables like solar and wind.”
The pathway calls for annual additions of solar PV to reach 630 GW by 2030, and those of wind power to reach 390 GW. The report said this combined capacity is four times what was installed in 2020, a record year. For solar PV, it is equivalent to installing the world’s current largest solar parks–around 1,000 MW–roughly every day.
“The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal… make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA executive director.
The roadmap sets out more than 400 milestones to guide the transition to net zero by 2050. These include no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects, and no further final investment for new coal plants without some form of carbon capture technology. By 2035, the roadmap calls for no sales of new internal combustion engine passenger cars, and by 2040, completion of a shift by the global electricity sector to net-zero emissions.
The report said that a worldwide push to increase energy efficiency is an essential part of these efforts. It said that such a push would result in the global rate of energy efficiency improvements averaging 4% a year through 2030, or about three times the average over the last two decades.
Most of the global reductions in CO2 emissions between now and 2030 would come from technologies available today. But in 2050, almost half the reductions would come from technologies that are currently only at the demonstration or prototype phase.
The IEA report said this demands that governments “quickly increase and reprioritize” spending on research and development. Progress in advanced batteries, electrolyzers for hydrogen, and direct air capture and storage could be impactful, the report said.
The IEA report said that total annual energy investment would grow to $5 trillion by 2030 in the net zero pathway, adding an extra 0.4 percentage points a year to global GDP growth, based on a joint analysis with the International Monetary Fund. The increase in private and government spending would create clean energy jobs, including energy efficiency, as well as in the engineering, manufacturing, and construction industries. All of this would put global GDP 4% higher in 2030 than it would be based on current trends, the report said.
By 2050, global energy demand would be around 8% smaller than today, but able to serve an economy more than twice as big and a population with 2 billion more people. The report said that by that date, almost 90% of electricity generation would come from renewable sources, with solar PV and wind together accounting for almost 70%. Most of the remainder would come from nuclear power.

For the modules, the company listed eight successful bidders including Longi, Trina Solar, Jinko, Risen, Canadian Solar, Suntech, Das Solar, and CECEP Solar Energy. According to Datang, 30% of the PV panels will be monocrystalline PERC 440 W+ products, and 70% mono-crystalline 530 W+ products. Longi secured the largest share in the tender with over 1.2 GW of capacity, followed by Trina Solar with 900 MW, and JinkoSolar and Risen with 600 MW and 300 MW, respectively. Regarding the tender for the inverters, Huawei and Sungrow secured the first and second-largest share for string inverters, respectively, for a total procured capacity of 3,750 MW. The remaining 1,250 MW were for central inverters, with Sineng and Sungrow securing the first two positions.
Monocrystalline module provider Longi said on Monday it intends to raise RMB7 billion ($1.09 billion) by issuing convertible bonds. The company wants to use net proceeds from the operation for two solar cell capacity expansion projects. Around RMB4.77 billion will be invested in a 15 GW solar cell manufacturing facility located in Xi’an and RMB1.08 billion will be for a 5 GW high-efficiency monocrystalline cell factory located  in Ningxia Province. Longi said the investment in solar cell capacity is for the implementation of  capacity to “catch up” with wafer and module capacities, which are now 85 GW and 50 GW, respectively.
PV module maker Talesun announced on Monday night that its unit Zhongli Talesun Hong Kong has sold 127 MW worth of panels to CPV Maple Hill Solar LLC, a U.S. based PV developer, for $33.5 million. The company operates 4.2 GW of renewable energy assets in the United states.

Spanish solar tracker and mounting systems manufacturer PV Hardware (PVH) announced today it will open a manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia.
The factory will be owned and operated by a newly created Saudi unit called PV Hardware Middle East and will produce PV trackers, mounting structures, and robotic cleaning devices ‘Made in KSA', in response to the rules for domestic content recently outlined by the country's government.
The new provisions will come into effect as of January 1, 2024, and see state contracts to foreign companies based outside the Kingdom halted. PVH explains that this new manufacturing center recently obtained the service and manufacturing license from the Saudi government. “Under this license, PV Hardware Middle East will manufacture its technology in the Kingdom, and will develop and train local manufacturers, equipping them with the knowledge to produce subassembly parts of this technology themselves,” the company said in a press release.
PVH announced its entry into the Saudi Arabian market in May 2019, when a memorandum of understanding was signed with the Saudi company Al Yamamah Solar Systems Factory, one of the leading steel manufacturers in the Middle East.

Beeplanet Factory is a Spanish manufacturer of energy storage systems based on discarded electric vehicle batteries. Today it announced the launch of the storage system Power ESS, which is also manufactured from second-life lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and is claimed to be an ideal solution for the commercial and industrial, primary, and construction sectors and for being combined with large-scale PV and wind power plants.
It is a flexible and modular system: starting from a 42 kWh rack, it can be expanded by modules connected in parallel up to 1 MWh. “In this way, once we have dimensioned the project, we install the necessary racks, knowing that if capacity needs to be expanded in the future,” the manufacturer said.
The system is also described as “ready to install indoors and outdoors,” with turnkey containerized solutions being offered for outdoor installations. The equipment is made up of minimum replaceable units, which is claimed to increase the lifecycle of the installation. “When we detect, through remote maintenance, that there is a minimum unit (stack, 20 kg in weight) that has reached its capacity limit, we take care of replacing and recycling it,” said the company.
With reinforced insulation on all accessible connectors and contactor failure detection function, the storage system features an IP54 enclosure and high tightness for atmospheres with particles and dust. The system has a guarantee of 4,000 cycles or seven years, and the components come with a two-year guarantee.
According to Beeplanet, the Power ESS system is able maximize the performance of a renewable installation in different sectors. Its main applications include commercial and industrial projects for self-consumption, storage for recharging infrastructure, and storage for microgrids.
In industrial facilities, the battery is said to improve the self-consumption ratio above 90%. In addition, the energy back-up ensures the production process in the event of network problems. In the primary sector, it may improve the performance of solar pumps, solve generation gaps in cloud steps, and save on production processes in the livestock and agricultural sector.
The system is also said to be suitable for energy communities, as it helps regulate voltage and frequency, responds to demand or peak shaving, maximizes the payback of the facilities, and provides auxiliary network services from 1 MWh. Finally, for manufacturers of charging points, it improves network access, speeds up start-up and allows the installation of quick charging at any location.

And we don’t have that kind of time scale in which to make some meaningful dent in emissions from steel-making today, at least in Europe,” he said during a Bloomberg NEF (BNEF) Summit held on Monday. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) sounds more of a feasible option, Clarke said, mentioning a project in Brazil and one in Belgium. “The technology box around BECCS-type technologies is either ticked, or basically on its way to being ticked.” Clarke also mentioned that ArcelorMittal is looking into direct electrolysis for steel production, instead of hydrogen.
Danish energy company Ørsted has started the onsite construction work of its first renewable hydrogen project (H2RES). The project in Copenhagen should produce hydrogen by the end of the year. Upon completion, it will have a capacity of 2 MW and produce up to around 1,000 kg of renewable hydrogen a day, which will be used for transport in the region. “The project will investigate how to best combine an efficient electrolyzer with the fluctuating power supply from offshore wind, using Ørsted's two 3.6 MW offshore wind turbines at Avedøre Holme,” reads a note released on Monday. Danish authorities awarded DKK 34.6 million (€4.65 million) to the development of the H2RES project to Ørsted, Everfuel Europe A/S, NEL Hydrogen A/S, Green Hydrogen Systems A/S, DSV Panalpina A/S, Hydrogen Denmark, and Energinet Elsystemansvar A/S. According to Ørsted, the “small” project will be “a very important first step” towards a hydrogen-based energy transition. Martin Neubert, Ørsted’s Deputy Group CEO, said during the virtual BNEF event that hydrogen is the Danish company’s “logical step” for them, mostly in Denmark, the U.K., the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium. Ørsted is focusing on collaboration in four sectors: refineries, ammonia production, steel, and heavy transport.
A group of 11 companies led by Greek gas company DEPA Commercial, submitted an €8 billion investment proposal for the development of the integrated green hydrogen “White Dragon” project in Greece to the Greek Government and the European Union. It  should cover the entire hydrogen value chain. The project aims to gradually replace the lignite power plants of West Macedonia. “Hydrogen will then be stored directly (short-term hydrogen storage) and indirectly (streaming through DESFA’s natural gas pipeline) and, subsequently, through high temperature fuel cells will provide the country’s power grid with electricity as a fixed base load co-generation unit of green energy and heat,” reads a note released last week. Advent Technologies, Damco Energy, Greek utility, PPC, DESFA, Hellenic Petroleum, Motor Oil, Corinth Pipeworks, TAP, and Terna Energy are the other partners.
The average monthly wind speeds and solar irradiance recorded between mid-January and mid-April suggest conditions at Oakajee SIA in Western Australia are compatible with the creation of a green hydrogen hub. “With a 6,400-hectare footprint, the Oakajee SIA has the capacity to support an extensive renewable energy hub and deliver power at internationally competitive power prices, essential for the competitive production of green hydrogen,” reads a press release issued last Friday by the government of Western Australia. It has committed more than AUD35 million towards developing a renewable hydrogen industry in the state. “We think it is not beyond the pale to suggest that in the next 10 years we could be producing up to 100GW of renewable energy for hydrogen and by 2040 that could be up to 200GW of power,” Hydrogen Minister Alannah MacTiernan said last week, as reported by local media. Earlier this month, work began at Australia’s first regional renewable hydrogen plant. “Horizon Power will install a 704 kW)solar farm, 348 kW hydrogen electrolyzer and a 100 kW fuel cell in Denham, enabling excess renewable energy to be used to produce renewable hydrogen which will be stored on site and used to power homes as required,” the Government of Western Australia wrote in early May.
Dijon, a city Northeastern France, is launching a €100 million hydrogen project to reduce the CO2 emissions of the territory's public transport starting in 2023. The green hydrogen project launched in 2020 is based on the construction of two local green hydrogen electrolysis production stations, with an initial combined daily production capacity of 1,320 kg of hydrogen. By 2030, Dijon Metropole aims to renew its entire fleet of heavy vehicles with hydrogen (over 220 vehicles).
Norway-based consultancy DNV joined Hydrogen Taskforce, a coalition of U.K. organizations operating and innovating in and across the hydrogen sector. “DNV will bring its extensive experience in managing low-carbon hydrogen and other sustainable energy value chains to the Taskforce,” reads a note released on Monday. The Taskforce is working closely with the Government on the forthcoming UK Hydrogen Strategy, which is expected to be published by September.
Chinese hydrogen fuel cell technologies provider Refire announced that, assisted by Germany’s certification company TÜV Nord, it has been granted certificates by the Dutch Vehicle Authority RDW, which will allow the company to introduce its products and services into the European market. Refire’s systems can be integrated into passenger and commercial vehicles. “The achievement reflects Refire's outstanding expertise in the design of fuel cell systems for electromagnetic compatibility which is known in the industry to be one of the key challenges in fuel cell development,” reads a note released on Friday.
The president of the Port Authority of Malaga, Carlos Rubio, and the CEO of Buran Habitat, Alejandro Garcia, signed an agreement to promote the energy transition in the third tourist cruise port of the peninsula. H2B2, a company that develops hydrogen production systems based on water electrolysis, is a technology partner. Africa Castro, head of business development at H2B2, said that “renewable hydrogen allows maximizing the reduction of emissions in port ecosystems, already highly integrated in urban environments, providing a solution to different means of transport and industrial machinery.” According to Rubio, green hydrogen “is going to be a key element in the energy transition process because it adapts very well to the port environment.” The project hinges also on digital solutions, including Artificial Intelligence.
The Green Hydrogen Coalition, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and other partners launched HyDeal LA, an initiative to achieve at-scale green hydrogen procurement at $1.50/kilogram in the Los Angeles Basin by 2030. HyDeal LA aims to lower costs through this commercial green hydrogen cluster at scale in California. HyDeal LA is part of HyDeal North America, a commercialization platform launched by the Green Hydrogen Coalition. It is modeled after HyDeal Ambition, a similar project in Europe committed to producing and buying 3.6 million tons of green hydrogen per year for the energy, industry, and mobility sectors at €1.5/kilogram (kg) before 2030.

The new provisions, which have been in force since May 9, when they were published in the country's official journal, are aimed at implementing the primary legislation for the grid connection of energy storage systems that was issued by the Turkish authorities in February 2020.
“According to the regulation, a separate storage facility can be established adjacent to the production facility and consumption facility,” Eren Engur, a board member of the energy storage committee at the Turkish PV association, Günder, told pv magazine. “Distribution companies will be able to establish a storage facility by proving that it is cost-effective.”
Furthermore, Engur explained that storage systems deployed by distribution companies may not be used for power trading, only for grid balancing. “Storage systems can be installed by requiring approval [from] the energy regulator, EMRA … and more than [one] system can be deployed under a supply license,” he added.
Moreover, universities and technology development regions were given the right to establish storage facilities – provided that they have at least 1 MW of installed power – to be used in research and development studies.
With the new rules, the Electricity Network Regulation for storage services was also amended. A further regulation, to provide the technical criteria for the grid services that could be provided, is expected to be issued by the government by September 1.
According to Engur, who cited recent reports on the Turkish storage market, the country has the potential for 16 GWh in the residential segment, 21 GWh in the commercial and industrial sector, and more than 25 GWh in the utility scale business. “Moreover, the government has recently introduced other measures that allow [the inclusion of] storage systems at existing power plants,” he further explained. “Considering we have 7 GW of solar and 9 GW of wind in operation, we can expect a market size of 1 GWh per year within two years.”

The Vision Style product is available in three versions with power output ranging from 370 W to 380 W and a power conversion efficiency of between 19.9% and 20.4%. It measures 1,780х1,052х40mm, weighs 25 kg and is built with 120 monocrystalline PERC cells with a size of 166x83mm.
The panel features an open-circuit voltage ranging from 33.9 V to 34.5 V and a short-circuit current of 10.99 A to 11.15 А. The maximum system voltage is 1,000 V.
The Vision Pure module is available with three different wattages spanning from 365 W to 375 W and efficiency ranging from 19.6% to 20.2%. It has the same size, weight, and number of cells as the Vision Style panel and also the same system voltage. Its open-circuit voltage ranges from 33.6 V to 34.2 V and the short-circuit current is between 11.45 A and 11.65 А.
The temperature coefficient for both panels is -0.37% and the manufacturer offers a 30-year product guarantee and a 30-year power output guarantee. The panels are said to be able to operate at 87% of their original performance at the end of the guarantee period.
The company said the new modules are being produced at its manufacturing facility in Dresden, eastern Germany, where it recently invested €15 million in the deployment of its new F8 production line. Another pilot line is expected to be installed at the factory next year, the manufacturer added, without providing more details.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/18/geopolitical-impact-of-long-distance-transport-of-electricity-and-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 18, 2021",Geopolitical impact of long-distance transport of electricity and hydrogen,"pv magazine: Prof. Overland, there is growing interest in the long-distance transport of energy in the form of electricity or hydrogen. However, large-scale infrastructure and clean fuel shipping will inevitably raise geopolitical concerns. Could this impact be similar to that associated with the long-distance transport of fossil fuels?
There may be some similarities, but I think there will also always be differences. Everybody has some renewable energy, so there is unlikely to be the same complete dependence on long-distance imports as many countries have had for fossil fuels. As it has been formulated elsewhere, renewable energy exporters will often be competing against their customers. The importers will be buying their energy because it is a bit more convenient and cheaper than producing their own, but if the risks and nuisances become too great, they might as well produce their own. So the exporters will need to treat their customers very nicely and cautiously. International trade in hydrogen might be a bit like overseas trade in liquefied natural gas (LNG) and to some, but a lesser extent similar to trade in oil. However, whereas natural gas and oil are only located in high concentrations in a minority of countries, more countries have an abundance of renewable energy that could be used to generate hydrogen. Thus, the producers in a global hydrogen economy would not have quite the same privileged position as the producers of oil and gas. It is also worth noting that the global markets for oil and natural gas are quite different, and whereas the former is basically fungible and can be moved anywhere in the world, the latter does not have a fully integrated world market yet. Despite the growing trade in LNG, LNG trade relationships are sometimes referred to as “floating pipelines,” and there are frequently large differences between the price of LNG in different parts of the world. Hydrogen will likely be more like LNG than oil due to the small initial market and large up-front capital requirements in infrastructure.
Could long-distance cables or pipelines be comparable to the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that is being built to bring Russian gas to Europe? Could electricity or hydrogen transport raise the same international tensions as gas pipelines?
NordStream 2 is controversial for several specific reasons. Because it increases EU dependency on Russia, because it is a tool for Russia to reduce its dependency on and thus gain power over Ukraine. Because Germany and German and other natural gas companies are pushing hard for it, although many other Europeans do not see it as being in the EU’s interest. And above all, because it locks in infrastructure for future expanded imports of fossil fuels. Taking into consideration all of these points, the international trade in renewable energy is very unlikely to be similar to NordStream 2. However, in principle and at a general structural level, trade in renewable energy could be similar to gas pipelines, especially if the energy is moved in the form of electricity via subsea cables.
A 14 GW solar project coupled to 33 GWh of storage is currently being planned in Australia's Northern Territory. The developer hopes to sell the generated energy to Singapore via a 4,500-km, high-voltage direct-current transmission network, including a 750-km overhead transmission line from a solar project in Darwin and a 3,800-km submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore, via Indonesia. What are the potential geopolitical consequences for Australia and the broader region, assuming that the project actually gets built?
I don’t think this project is realistic. The cables are incredibly long and expensive and they would traverse the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, a part of our planet that is particularly prone to volcano eruptions and earthquakes. If Singapore really needs to buy renewable energy from Australia, it would likely make more sense to transport it as hydrogen. This would give both the Singaporeans and the Australians more flexibility, in case there are any disruptions or changes of plans. Singapore could also work more on other options. Despite lack of space for renewable energy installations, the Singaporeans could do a lot more to develop their own energy system, by raising energy efficiency and facilitating accelerated rooftop and floating solar power development. They could also work harder to build trust and source electricity from neighboring countries and then have a smaller portion of expensive long-distance hydrogen with an option to ramp up in case of a need. This long-distance element could be partly from Australia and partly from other sources for further risk mitigation.
Another 10 GW wind-solar complex coupled with 20 GWh of storage is currently being developed in Morocco. The electricity produced by the huge plant could potentially be exported to the United Kingdom via a 1.8 GW submarine cable that would cross the territorial waters of Morocco, Spain, Portugal and France. Assuming that this ambitious project is completed, would this mean the success of the Desertec dream? What kind of geopolitical impact could this have on North Africa and Europe?
The Morocco-U.K. project is slightly different from Desertec – and perhaps not quite as rational, since the U.K. is not on the Mediterranean – but the principle is similar. I think something along the lines of Desertec is inevitably going to be realized sooner or later, and probably sooner rather than later. North Africa has incredibly rich renewable sources, both in terms of sunshine and wind. Equally importantly, North Africa has huge amounts of available suitable space for solar and wind power and very large markets nearby in Europe. In that regard, the starting point is much better than for the Australia-Singapore project.
Where could the most strategic links for power and hydrogen transmission be built? Are there specific regions that would benefit more from such infrastructure?
I think the North Africa-Europe axis is the most promising one. Central and Western Europe have very little free space due to population density, farming and sprawling infrastructure. They have very high energy consumption due to wealth and cold climate. They have purchasing power – they do not want to become overly dependency on eastern neighbors. Europe is also the global leader in climate policy and renewable energy installation and needs more energy sources and connections to stabilize its own supply of intermittent renewable energy. As explained, above, North Africa has correspondingly good conditions for renewable energy developments, and the distance to Europe is not that great. Another possible axis might be Mexico-USA, but the USA has quite a lot of space and resources of its own and is thus different from Europe. Australia-Asia as discussed above might also be an option, but Australia is far away, especially from the large markets like China, Japan, and South Korea. Mongolia/Russia/Central Asia-China/Korea/Japan is another possible axis. I don’t think any of these axes have the same potential as North Africa-Europe, but they may still be developed later on.
Could hydrogen pipelines be a better option than electric cables? Hydrogen could also eventually be transported via existing gas pipelines, provided that they are suitable for the transport of the clean fuel.
There are different views among experts, but most seem to be tilting toward the view that natural gas pipelines can be repurposed for hydrogen relatively easily. So, yes, that could give hydrogen an advantage. However, hydrogen also has a disadvantage in that its production is not very efficient. It also seems unlikely that hydrogen will ever play a major role in person vehicles, as batteries are advancing fast, and even for heavier transport, the question is open. I think the really promising initial niches for hydrogen are in handling intermittent renewable energy and in certain industrial processes. Where and whether it will grow from there and whether it can compete with other options like batteries and interconnections is hard to say.
What kind of alliances might arise around these big projects? What are the biggest potential obstacles?
Since I see the North Africa-Europe axis as most promising, I think that is also where there is the greatest scope for the development of international relationships based on energy projects. Such developments will probably create some losers, but I think they will be so indirect and far down the line that it is difficult to see what they could do to oppose such projects. Perhaps Russian engagement in Libya could be seen in such a perspective, but I don’t think the Russians are thinking along those lines at all at the moment.
Is there any chance we might see a hyper-connected world with an increasing number of cables and pipelines, if more large-scale projects are built to bring down costs?
I think we will see a lot of integration within countries, within regions and between regions. For starters, north and south Germany need better connections. But I don’t think there is going to be a need to connect the whole world. For example, connecting the Americas to the rest of the world would be expensive and introduce new risks that would outweigh the advantages. The Americas are big enough on their own to handle the intermittency.
Is it possible that energy, including both renewable electricity and hydrogen, will be consumed mostly on site or close to production, rather than transported to other distant locations? What conditions will be needed to make this happen?
This is a very interesting question. Embedded renewable energy is a new area I am working on. If we look back at the fossil fuel past, we can see that such hopes and promises were often not realized. One of the main purposes of OPEC was to use oil and gas resources to promote industrialization in the OPEC countries. But little ever came of it, despite some exceptions like Qatalum – the world’s largest aluminum producer, based in Qatar and using Qatari natural gas. In addition, renewable energy resources are more evenly distributed in the world than fossil fuel resources. Although some countries have a lot of sunshine or wind and space, almost all countries have some and few are as disproportionately resource-rich as the Qataris are in terms of gas. I think there are still good prospects for renewables-based industrialization, but it will require a very proactive and competent approach on the part of states rich in renewable energy resources.

Note: In the past, the average prices for mono PERC modules considered the prices of earlier orders and delivery cycles, which could lag when prices changed rapidly. Since the price gap between spot prices and prices of long-term orders signed earlier has widened significantly this year, PV InfoLink has started using spot prices for module price forecast from this month.
Despite weak end-user demand, polysilicon prices remained high at CNY 135-140/kg ($20.7-21.5/kg, falling to $18.4-19.1 when China’s 13% VAT rate is excluded), in mid-April, a peak for recent times. Accordingly, PV InfoLink has revised its price forecasts upward.
The first half of the year has seen polysilicon capacity additions from East Hope and GCL-Poly, as well as some smaller Chinese manufacturers reopening production lines amid high prices. Tongwei’s Yongxiang unit will bring a larger volume of new capacity online at the end of the year. The PV supply chain currently embodies more than 200 GW of annual polysilicon capacity, enough to fulfill 155 GW of end-user demand. However, the large scale of recent wafer and cell capacity expansions has led to panic buying and stockpiling. Gaojin and other manufacturers will add larger volumes of ingot pulling capacity in the second half of the year, while some large polysilicon manufacturers will conduct annual equipment maintenance in the third quarter. Polysilicon is now the biggest bottleneck in the supply chain. In anticipation of a further shortage in the third quarter, trading prices for large orders between large manufacturers reached CNY 128-130 ($19.6-19.9)/kg at the beginning of April, up 10% from the CNY 115-120 ($17.7-18.4)/kg orders signed in March. The upward trend continued to mid-April, with prices sitting as high as CNY 130-140 ($19.9-21.5)/kg.
Since the second half of 2021 will see significantly stronger demand than the first, and new polysilicon capacity won’t come online until the end of the year, shortages will persist until the arrival of the low season and after the Lunar New Year 2022, when new production lines are up and running. The average price of polysilicon in 2021 will come in at CNY 117 ($17.9)/kg, far higher than the average of CNY 76 ($11.7)/kg last year.
China’s Xinjiang region accounts for more than 40% of global polysilicon production. The impact on the solar sector of international moves against forced labor should be watched very carefully. If a ban on import of modules using Xinjiang-made polysilicon takes effect, polysilicon supply in non-Xinjiang regions, although sufficient to fulfill U.S. demand, will be tight due to the pre-existing shortage. If restrictions are brought in, a price gap between polysilicon in Xinjiang and non-Xinjiang regions will emerge.
Polysilicon prices
In the face of price hikes, cell manufacturers continue to buy wafers for fear of difficulty acquiring enough materials. This is despite significantly lower utilization rates and purchase volumes of cells among module makers in April. As a result, wafer prices have been on the rise along with polysilicon between March and April.
Since the end of the Lunar New Year, wafers and cells each have around 16-17 GW of monthly production, an identical factory output. However, there is only around 13-14 GW of module production and 10-12 GW of end-user demand each month, suggesting cell and module makers are faced with inventory pressure.
While production cuts did not help to ease pressure on module inventories in April, price competition did not occur as before. Large module makers were busy securing profits and seeking to keep prices stable. Even prices for 3.2 mm glass slipped from CNY 38-40 ($5.8-6-1)/m² to CNY 28 ($4.3)/m² in April and brought down overall costs by CNY 0.04-0.05 ($0.0054-0.0068)/W. Module prices in the Chinese market only declined by CNY 0.02/W as of mid-April. Another round of price increases in mono and multi-Si wafers in April again hurt PV module profits.
Price quotes for modules for the second half are much higher than the pre-Lunar New Year period. Monofacial modules rated beyond 500 W are estimated to be priced at CNY 1.65-1.67/W and $0.22/W in the third quarter, a marginal decrease compared with CNY 1.68-1.7/W and $0.225-0.23/W. No intense price competition occurred, because large manufacturers, which have become increasingly dominant this year, prioritized keeping profits and stabilizing prices rather than grabbing market share. Therefore, the mainstream trading prices are little impacted, even though Tier-2 and Tier-3 module makers offered lower prices.
As the upward price trend for modules continues, with orders signed earlier being renegotiated more recently, the internal rate of returns for PV power plants has also taken a hit, forcing many projects to postpone construction. For now, demand forecast for non-China markets is around 100 GW – not much increase compared with last year’s 95 GW. Having said that, Chinese demand outlook still looks bright this year, because PV plant developers wish to stay in line with the government’s renewable energy directive to meet installation goals, and the residential sector will continue to be subsidized this year. It’s estimated that the global PV market will see around 155 GW of solar PV module demand.

The huge facility will be used for the production of “millions of tons” of green hydrogen, which the three companies said could be consumed on-site, exported, or converted into green ammonia for international export. 
Although the exact location of the project was not indicated, the consortium said it will be near the coast for seawater intake and electrolysis. “Given the site's strategic location between Europe and Asia, as well as excellent solar irradiance and wind resource facing the Arabian Sea, the development is well positioned to offer a secure and reliable supply of green fuels globally at a highly competitive price,” it said in a statement.
The three companies began to develop the project in 2019, when they conducted the first analysis on the project site. “Given the amount of equipment required at a project of this scale, it could also support the development of Oman’s renewable energy supply chain manufacturing and expertise,” they further explained.
More technical and financial details on the new scheme were not released.
This is not the only large-scale green hydrogen project under development in the Middle Eastern country.
Oman's Sohar Port and Freezone, a deep-sea port and adjacent free zone located in the homonymous coastal city, announced in November a plan to host a large scale green hydrogen generation hub powered by solar power plants. This plan envisages the deployment or around 3.5 GW of PV capacity, which is equivalent to the port's total electricity consumption.

India's Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), an entity under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, has launched an anti-dumping probe into solar cells from China, Thailand and Vietnam, based on a request by domestic manufacturers.
The application was filed by Mundra Solar PV, Jupiter Solar Power and Jupiter International, via the Indian Solar Manufacturers Association (ISMA). The manufacturers have been seeking the imposition of anti-dumping duties to protect them from material injury caused by such imports at unfairly low prices.
The DGTR said it has identified prima facie evidence to suggest that the normal value of solar cells in each of the three exporting countries significantly surpass net export prices. It said this indicates the potential dumping of such products into India.
The applicants have claimed that this has prevented them from selling in the open market (installations in the private domain). Throughout the 18-month period of the investigation (July 2019 to December 2020), their sales volumes were negligible in the open market, where they compete with imported goods. The domestic manufacturers claim that this has left them with unused capacity, even after securing sales under the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) scheme, which mandates the use of domestically made equipment for 12 GW of solar projects to be set up by state-run power generators.
Based on the submitted evidence, the DGTR has announced the launch of an investigation to identify the alleged dumping of solar cells from China, Thailand, and Taiwan. It has also said that any anti-dumping duties that might be imposed should be high enough to address the negative impact on the Indian cell industry.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/18/pv-modules-shipping-at-lower-prices-in-us-eia-data-shows/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"MAY 18, 2021","PV modules shipping at lower prices in US, EIA data shows","From pv magazine USA
More solar modules are being shipped at lower prices than ever before in the United States, according to the latest edition of the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Monthly Solar Photovoltaic Module Shipments Report.
In January, 1.725 GW of modules were shipped at an average price of $0.36 per watt – the lowest price per watt since the EIA began tracking module shipments in 2017. In February, prices fell to new record lows, as 1.728 GW of modules were shipped at an average price of $0.34 per watt. In March, the price per watt was extended, while a new record was set for total modules shipped, as 2.712 GW of modules were shipped at an average price of $0.34 per watt.
The jump in capacity recorded in March was noteworthy because it happened in the first quarter. Historically, module shipment spikes have occurred later in the year, as developers look to lock in that year’s investment tax credits (ITC) through a safe harbor provision that allows them to pay 5% or more of the cost of a project. Considering that modules represent more than 5% of total project costs, securing modules at the end of the year has been a common way to lock in the prior year’s ITC.
In March, California led the way, as it typically does, with 574 MW of modules shipped to projects in the state. Texas was a close second, with 544 MW of capacity shipped to in-state projects. Five other states recorded more than 100 MW of module shipments in March, a milestone that had not before been accomplished.
The five states were Georgia at 190 MW, Illinois at 116 MW, Nevada at 131 MW, North Carolina at 118 MW, and Virginia at 110 MW. Unlike previous versions of the EIA report, the top states for shipments did not feature any surprises, as most of the leading states are known solar hotbeds. Illinois was perhaps the only outlier, although it has solidified its solar commitment in recent years.
February and March also featured the lowest cost per watt in the history of the report. Both months notched an average cost per peak watt of $0.34, edging out the previous record of $0.36, set in January. That price had been reached four other times since early 2020.
The mark also was lower than March 2020’s average price of $0.37 per watt, though drops in average price have become less significant as the solar market has matured. It used to be common for prices to fluctuate by a couple of cents per month. That trend leveled out in February 2020, and no single-month change has been greater than $0.02 since.
