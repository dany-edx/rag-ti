Longi set a May price of RMB4.86 per piece (US$0.75) for its p-type M10 (182mm) wafers and RMB4 for the M6 (166mm) size. The price for the p-type M2 (158.75mm) prodyct was set at RMB3.90 per piece. Zhonghuan Semiconductor raised the prices of all its wafers. The cost of its M6 wafer rose 30 fen – 7.5% – to RMB4.28 per piece, and M2 products rose in price from RMB3.81 to RMB4.01. Zhonghuan's M12 (210mm) wafer price increased from RMB6.33 to RMB6.53. All the products mentioned have a thickness of 175um.
China's largest solar cell maker, Tongwei, released its May prices on Wednesday, with its polycrystalline 157 cell type becoming 3 fen per watt more expensive, at RMB0.73 (US$0.11) and other products unchanged. The monocrystalline PERC 158.75 type remains priced at RMB0.96 per watt, the mono PERC 166 type RMB0.89 per watt, and the mono PERC 210 type RMB0.91.
Longi has won a tender to supply the modules for a 100 MW agrivoltaic project held by the Hubei Energy Group. The project is planned in Xinglong county. The first panel shipments will be made no later than July and all the modules will be delivered by October.
China's National Energy Administration (NEA) today revealed the nation added 5.33 GW of solar generation capacity in the first three months of the year, to take the national total to 258.5 GW. Commercial. industrial and residential solar supplied 2.81 GW of the January-to-March additions, with the balance from utility scale solar parks. Shandong province again took top spot, with a 1.05 GW share of the quarterly total. The first-quarter figure announced by the NEA undershot the 5.53 estimate made by the China Photovoltaic Industry Association and reported in the brief last week.
Cross-defaulting polysilicon manufacturer GCL-Poly yesterday announced it had sold off a further 127 MW of its solar project capacity to two state-owned enterprises, to raise RMB355 million (US$54.8 million) to pay down debts as well as removing RMB464 million (US$71.6 million) of liabilities from its books. The company, and its heavily-indebted GCL New Energy solar project operation, sold off four solar plants to Guangdong Jinyuan New Energy Co Ltd and State Power Investment Corp Guizhou Jinyuan Weining Energy Co Ltd, at a book loss of RMB65.2 million (US$10 million). GCL-Poly’s shares are currently suspended on the Hong Kong exchange as it has been unable to publish its 2020 annual results. The company is undergoing a debt restructure.
Solar manufacturer Solargiga on Friday announced it had acquired a controlling stake in state-owned PV tech and energy storage manufacturer Jiangsu Yueyang Photovoltaic Technology Co Ltd, following a RMB100 million capital injection into the business in November. Solargiga subsidiary Jinzhou Yangguang spent RMB24.2 million on a 17.8% stake in the business, which is owned by Jianhu county, and that acquisition, in conjunction with the capital commitment, ensured Solargiga holds a 65% controlling stake in Jiangsu Yueyang.

The company's board told the Hong Kong Stock Exchange today, it expects to have to install energy storage linked to 11.8 MW of its Chinese solar projects in the second half of the year, and a further 47 MW per year for the following two years.
Xinyi said it has no energy storage capacity associated with its solar farms at present, as they feed directly into grids without curtailment. However, the board expects energy storage to be mandated as a result of the nation's latest five-year plan, which was announced last month.
The company estimates the bill for installing lithium-ion battery storage will come to RMB19.6 million (US$3.02 million) this year, RMB74.1 million (US$11.4 million) next year and RMB66.3 million in 2023. Those figures are based on lithium-ion battery price predictions of RMB1.659/W (US$0.256) this year, RMB1.576/W next year and RMB1.41 in 2023, the board said.
Xinyi said it expects to have to taper up the proportion of its solar project generation capacity linked to storage to 5-20% in stages.
The figures were revealed in a stock market update in which the board indicated a preference to source the energy storage facilities, and associated tech for its glass production operations, from Xinyi Electric Storage Holdings Limited.

Alongside aluminum’s relative abundance compared to lithium and many other materials with favorable energy storage characteristics, scientists have noted the potential for aluminum to exchange three electrons per ion, bringing the potential for far higher storage capacities. Taking advantage of this potential, however, has proved challenging. “The core advantage of aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) is its capability to store multivalent carrier ions to increase the specific capacity of electrode materials,” states a new paper from a group of scientists led by Seoul National University. “Unfortunately, nearly all the cathode materials reported to date operate on the basis of the storage of monovalent complex ions such that the true benefit of AIBs has not been fully taken advantage of.”
In the paper Tetradiketone macrocycle for divalent aluminium ion batteries, published in Nature Communications, this group demonstrates a new cathode material based on organic molecule tetradiketone. The group was able to take advantage of a “radical destabilization” effect within this molecule, which makes storage of multiple electrons per aluminum ion the dominant process within a battery. Based on this, the group was able to design a cathode material with a specific capacity of 350 milliamp-hours per gram, and an operating voltage of 1.3 V. The material also retained 78% of its initial capacity after 8000 cycles.
“This study offers useful insights into the way in which active molecules can be designed to activate their capability of storing divalent aluminium ions and thus take due advantage of multivalent batteries,” the group states. They further suggest that more work on similar molecules in the diketone family and a deeper understanding of the destabilization effect they observed in these materials could lead to more impressive results.

That was one of the findings of the latest edition of the Emerging Market Green Bond Report published by World Bank private-sector arm the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and French asset manager Amundi.
According to the third edition of the publication, published this month, China issued $18 billion of green bonds last year, most of them from July onwards, as East Asia and the Pacific regions dominated a $40 billion emerging market segment.
With China having posted more than $30 billion in green bonds in “previous years,” according to the IFC report, the fall was put down to the need to mobilize funding to drive an economic recovery from Covid-19 in the first half of the year.
The study is predicting emerging market green bond issuance worth $100 billion over the next three years, against a whole-world backdrop of $1 trillion of green bonds issued since 2007, thanks to $280 billion worth of issuances last year.
The IFC said Egypt, Kazakhstan and Saudi Arabia were among seven 'emerging nations' to issue their first green bonds during 2020, as 101 entities launched 174 bonds with a total value of $40 billion. Other large providers of the sustainable finance instruments included Chile, Brazil and Indonesia, the IFC said in a press release published to publicize the report.
The IFC has stated green investment opportunities worth more than $10 trillion could be on offer this decade, driving the creation of 200 million jobs.

The coronavirus pandemic continues to make planning difficult for trade fair operators. The organizers of The Smarter E in Munich – Solar Promotion GmbH and Freiburg Wirtschaft Touristik und Messe GmbH & Co. KG (FWTM) – decided to postpone the event to October. 
The event, which includes the four energy fairs Intersolar Europe, ees Europe, Power2Drive Europe and EM-Power Europe, was postponed, a first time, to July, in February.
The fair, which is now expected to take place between October 6 and 8, will not include the smarter E Industry Days, including the award ceremony for The smarter E Award, Intersolar Award and ees Award 2021, which will instead be held digitally. Keynotes on the most important industry trends, product presentations, panel discussions, interactive workshops and digital factory tours by exhibitors are planned for the online event. In addition, the award winners will be presented on a digital stage during the ‘industry days.'
Despite the progress made with vaccinations and rapid tests in Europe, the organizers say there is no positive signal from politicians that the event is feasible. In order to give exhibitors, visitors, congress participants, speakers, sponsors and the organizers themselves planning security, the decision to postpone the date was made in close coordination with the international trade associations in the industry.
“We are convinced that, with the unscheduled event in October 2021, we are responding to the desire of the dynamically growing industry to be able to present ourselves on a platform this year and to exchange ideas personally,” said FWTM managing director Daniel Strowitzki, adding that the smarter E Europe 2022, which is planned to take place from May 11 to 13, 2022, is currently being planned.

The fund would allocate €1.5 billion of grants from EU resources, tied to a total loan package of €10 billion, to be made available by the European Investment Bank. The money will be for public sector institutions in the regions of the bloc most likely to suffer from the move away from fossil fuel power generation.
The council, which is composed of representatives of member state governments, and the parliament will now need to ratify the deal agreed yesterday, with legislation for the public sector loan facility set to follow “in the coming weeks,” the EU announced yesterday. Provided member states have completed just transition plans approved by the European Commission, they will be eligible to apply for grant and loan funding, with the first call for projects slated for the autumn.
The parliament yesterday raised the generosity of the public sector loan facility by negotiating that the less-developed regions of the EU – previously defined as having less than 75% of the bloc's average per-capita GDP – will be able to receive 25% of their funding in the form of grants, up from the 20% previously suggested. More developed regions will be eligible for 15% grant support.
The deal agreed yesterday also extends the period during which the new funding stream will be fenced off for just transition regions, by a year, until the end of 2025. After that point, any remaining funds will be made available for bidding by EU member states without regard to their just transition eligibility.
The EU hopes the €11.5 billion package will generate €25-30 billion of investment in the energy transition.

The network is made up by Airbus, ArcelorMittal, Gasnetz Hamburg, GreenPlug, Hamburger Hafen und Logistik, Hamburg Port Authority, HADAG Seetouristik und Fährdienst, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Shell, Vattenfall, and Wärme Hamburg. “Financial support by the federal German government, under the IPCEI program, is necessary to implement this landmark interconnection project and close the price gap between green hydrogen and fossil solutions,” reads a statement released on Monday, explaining that the application includes nine projects. Shell, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), Vattenfall and municipal company Wärme Hamburg are planning to produce hydrogen from wind and solar power at the Hamburg-Moorburg power plant site, deploying a scalable electrolyzer with an initial output of 100 MW. Additionally, apart from logistics and mobility solutions, the application includes a waste-to-hydrogen project and the reconversion of ArcelorMittal’s Hamburg plant to climate-neutral steel production by 2030.
German gas grid operator Gascade and Dutch gas provider Gasunie have teamed up with energy companies RWE and Shell to step up collaboration on the AquaDuctus project, the “first German offshore hydrogen pipeline.” The companies expect commissioning in 2035. AquaDuctus is taking part in the IPCEI process of the German government. “The AquaDuctus pipeline will transport green hydrogen from the North Sea directly to the continent. It is part of the AquaVentus initiative, which plans to install 10 GW of electrolysis capacity for green hydrogen production from offshore wind power between Heligoland and the Dogger sand bank,” reads a note released on Monday. The AquaDuctus project will first undergo a feasibility study.
Siemens Energy and Germany-based industrial gases company Messer Group signed a cooperation agreement to collaborate on green hydrogen projects in the 5 MW to 50 MW range, for industrial and mobility applications. Within the framework of this agreement, Messer Ibérica has presented, to the Spanish government, three green hydrogen projects at the Tarragona chemical complex, the largest chemical park in Spain. The total electrolyzer capacity is expected to total 70 MW. “We are focused on developing technologies that make our customers’ production processes safer, more efficient and eco-friendly, including clean hydrogen applications in industry and in mobility. Together with Siemens Energy, we will extend these advantages to industrial customers switching to green hydrogen produced by electrolysis,” Stefan Messer, owner and CEO of Messer Group, commented in the press release.
S&P Global Ratings published, last week, a report on the future of hydrogen, in which it singles out the sectors that will first embrace hydrogen: industrial gas, oil refining, chemical and, later, possibly, fertilizers. “Net zero commitments imply the full decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors such as steel but using hydrogen to do so would be extremely costly. We therefore see steelmakers' credit quality as most at risk, since the sector's profitability has been weak for years,” reads the note published on Thursday.
Dutch energy and commodity trading company Vitol acquired a 10% equity interest in Gen2 Energy, a Norwegian producer of green hydrogen. The company didn’t disclose the details of the investment. Gen2 Energy aims to use Norway’s surplus hydroelectric power to produce green hydrogen, targeting the European market. “Work at the company’s initial site, in the north of Norway, is under way and, once complete, it will have a capacity of at least 80 MW, producing 11.7kt per annum of green hydrogen. Simultaneously, Gen2 Energy is developing a second green hydrogen facility in the south west of Norway, with an eventual capacity of 300 MW,” the company said.
Norway-based service company Aibel and hydrogen company Nel ASA entered into a framework agreement to develop renewable hydrogen projects. The first collaboration effort will be the delivery of the 20 MW PEM hydrogen production plant to Iberdrola, which was announced at the beginning of the year. “This partnership is a long-term commitment,” Jon André Løkke, CEO of Nel ASA, commented in a statement released on Monday. Aibel is also active in Dogger Bank.
Brussels-headquartered materials technology company Umicore, and British mining company Anglo American, through its PGMs business Anglo American Platinum, announced a research and development collaboration agreement to develop PGM-based catalysts for liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) applications on fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and other mobile applications. “This catalyst technology has the potential to transform the way hydrogen can be stored and used to power FCEVs,” wrote Umicore in a press note published on Monday.
GH2, a developer of renewable hydrogen projects, and the Grand Port Maritime de Bordeaux, signed an agreement for the implementation of a €250 million renewable hydrogen production and conversion project in New Aquitaine. The project aims to produce up to 14,000 tons of renewable hydrogen per year. According to a note released on Thursday, it includes a 100 MWe alkaline electrolyser, two new, local, dedicated photovoltaic power plants, and an electrochemical plant. The project is located in the port area near Bordeaux, alongside the Garonne river.
South African integrated energy and chemical company Sasol, and Sonatrach Raffineria Italiana (SRI), a subsidiary of the national state-owned oil company of Algeria, formed a Temporary Association of Companies (ATI) to collaborate on developing hydrogen production projects in Sicily. “The petrochemical area of Syracuse can and must play a key role in the energy transition,” Rosario Pistorio, CEO of SRI, commented in a note released on Friday. According to the companies, Sicily could become an integrated hydrogen ecosystem, or ‘hydrogen valley.'
The Italian Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Association, which includes companies, research centers and universities, exceeded the 70-member threshold with a nearly 50% increase in members since the beginning of the year. “Making a common front and creating a unique network of collaboration is the only way to create a strong Italian supply chain, [a] leader also at international level,” Alberto Dossi, president of H2IT, commented in a note released on Monday.

French renewable energy provider Ekwateur is offering a plug-in solar kit for balconies and gardens that is claimed to produce between 340 kWh and 500 kWh per year, depending on solar radiation levels.
The kit, which requires a surface of only 2 square meters, is equipped with a 330 W solar module produced by Slovenian manufacturer Bisol, a micro-inverter, a metallic structure, a monitoring sensor, and a few cables. The sensor makes it possible to visualize the actual production of the solar panel via a mobile application. 
The company said the solar kit is sold in France for €699. It added it is possible to combine several kits, thus making it possible to take charge of several electrical appliances in a house. The panel is claimed to be 95% recyclable and its power guarantee is valid for 25 years. The product is entirely assembled in the Ardèche, a department in southeast France.
“When we launched this offering last year, we didn't think it would have been so successful,” said Cécile Philippon, innovation project manager at Ekwateur. “This craze proves the growing interest of consumers in green energy.”
When the module was launched, its power output was 300 W and the expected annual production between 340 kWh and 450 kWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/27/solid-state-solar-cells-based-on-metal-organic-framework-nanomaterials/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 27, 2021",Solid-state solar cells based on metal-organic framework nanomaterials,"Scientists from Universitat Politecnica de Valencia in Spain have developed solid-state solar cells with special kinds of metal-organic framework (MOF) nanomaterials.
MOFs are new, promising porous materials in the areas of gas absorption and separation, catalysis, drug delivery, and molecule sensing. Nanoparticles made of such materials are used as components in chemical sensors, biological probes, and membrane separation materials, and serve as building blocks for colloidal crystal engineering.
The Spanish researchers said the porous nanomaterials are also appealing for solar cell applications due to their flexibility in design and preparation, extremely high surface-area values, and tunable pore volumes and pore size distributions. They used two different MOFs that are known as MIL-125(Ti) and UiO-67(Zr) and whose behavior as semiconductors and photocatalysts is already known. The nanomaterials do not absorb visible light and their properties have been confirmed by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry analysis, surface area (BET) measurements, and infrared spectroscopy.
The scientists built solar cells with five layers, including indium tin oxide (ITO), titanium oxide (TiO2), spiro-MeOTAD, and gold. Spiro-MeOTAD is the best solid-state hole transporting material that has been used thus far for solid-state, dye-sensitized solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, and perovskite solar cells.
“TiO2 was deposited between the transparent conducting electrode (ITO) and the MOF material and a transparent hole transport layer of spiro-MeOTAD was deposited on top of the MOF,” the academics explained, adding that the gold metallic layer was deposited on top of a polymer substrate as a cathode electrode.

The cells built with the MIL-125(Ti) showed the best performance and highest current density between the two devices. The researchers attributed this to the long-lived lifetime of the charge-separated state and more efficient photo-induced charge separation. In particular,  a cell fabricated with  MIL-125(Ti) and groups of amino radical (NH2) showed increased photovoltaic activity compared to other solid-state cells.
“Currently the efficiency is lower than 1%, since it is a proof of concept, and still requires some optimization of the material,” researcher Pedro Atienzar told pv magazine. “For instance, decreasing particle size and increasing charge carrier mobility within the MOF particle are two parameters that should lead to further increase in efficiency.”
Atienzar also described the process to produce the MOFs as an easy synthetic procedure. He said the use of abundant, non-toxic, cheap materials could soon enable the low-cost production of solid-state solar cells based on nanomaterials.
“In view of the cost materials and simple methodology, their fabrication is feasible,” he said.
The researchers described the solar cells in “Photoactive Zr and Ti Metal‐Organic‐Frameworks for Solid‐State Solar Cells,” which was recently published in ChemPhysChem.

The passivating contact was made with a silicon-oxide tunnel layer followed by two layers of hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon carbide (nc-SiC:H(n)), deposited at different temperatures, and a sputtered indium tin oxide (ITO) layer. The researchers explained that, prior to their research, nc-SiC:H(n) layers used as passivating contacts had issues in featuring high transparency, good conductivity and at the same time offering enough hydrogenation for passivation.
They claimed that this problem was solved by using exclusively low-temperature processes and a thin, wet-chemically-grown silicon dioxide (SiO2) tunnel oxide, and hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD). A double layer stack of nc-SiC:H(n) was deposited with low and high-filament temperatures to tackle the trade-off between passivation and conductivity.
Compared to conventional processes, this manufacturing technique is said to work without any high-temperature recrystallization, hydrogenation or firing steps. “Another reason for the high passivation quality is that the SiO2 layer is working as a protection layer against the hostile deposition conditions during the HWCVD process,” the research group emphasized. “The SiO2 prevents interface damage and simultaneously reduces the dangling bond density at the crystalline silicon surface.”
An anti-reflective coating was also placed on the device and it achieved a certified efficiency of 23.99%, an open-circuit voltage of 725 mV, a short-circuit current density of 40.87 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 80.9%. “In view of the short research history, we see scope for further improvements beyond the present efficiency of 24%, to a practical efficiency of 25%,” the scientists stated. “Numerical simulations predict an efficiency of 26% by improving fill factor and open-circuit voltage via optimizing the silicon heterojunction contact at the rear side and introducing a frontier metallization approach such as copper plating.”
The cell and the transparent passivating contacts are presented in the paper A silicon carbide-based highly transparent passivating contact for crystalline silicon solar cells approaching efficiencies of 24%, published in nature energy.
Other participants in the project included researchers from the Delft University of Technology and the Eindhoven University of Technology, in the Netherlands, as well as from the Novosibirsk State University, in Russia.

BSW-Solar, the German solar industry association, has revealed that 15 agricultural companies, solar businesses, research entities, and certification bodies have developed a new proposed standard for the construction of agrivoltaic projects.
The DIN SPEC 91434 standard was initially developed by experts from the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE and the University of Hohenheim.
BSW-Solar Managing Director Carsten Körnig sees the establishment of new standards as an important prerequisite for accelerating the market development of agrivoltaics. He pointed to the innovation tenders that the German government is currently holding under the framework of the country's renewable energy law, the so-called EEG.
“In order to leverage scaling effects, regular tenders with a growing volume will also be necessary in the following years,” said Körnig.
The current regulatory provisions for the innovation tenders require the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) to work out definitions for what can be considered agrivoltaics. BSW-Solar suggests using the DIN SPEC 91434 standard as a basis for this.
The organizations behind DIN SPEC 91434 have presented the standard in “DIN SPEC 91434:2021-05 Agri-Photovoltaik-Anlagen – Anforderungen an die landwirtschaftliche Hauptnutzung,” which was recently published by Beuth. It lays down requirements for the main agricultural uses in agrivoltaic projects and includes standards for planning, operation, documentation, and operational monitoring.
In addition, there are measurement indicators for quality assurance test procedures. However, the paper does not look at conventional ground-mounted PV plants built on agricultural land, or solar greenhouses.

Using current technology and available locations, it would be possible to capture at least 6,700 petawatt hours per annum from solar and wind, which is more than 100 times global energy demand, the Carbon Tracker Initiative said in a new report.
The decline in the cost of renewables over the past three years also means that half of this solar and wind potential is now economically viable, and by the end of the decade it will be above 90%.
“The technical and economic barriers [for renewables] have been crossed and the only impediment to change is political,” said Carbon Tracker.

Lucky country
Australia, along with Africa and South America, “stand out as having huge technical potential compared to energy demand,” the report's authors said.
“In terms of the renewable energy potential per person, Australia is in a league of its own with over 10,000 MWh per person per annum,” Carbon Tracker said. “With vast renewable potential and a low population, it is thus well positioned to become the battery of the world.”
However, the think tank noted that Australia’s geographic characteristics may not necessarily lend themselves to exports.

Due to Australia’s abundance of space, Carbon Tracker says it's unlikely that Australia (like Africa and Russia) will need to invest much in offshore wind platforms.
Solo solar?
The report also looked into the land required to power the world solely from solar PV panels. It found that 450,000 square kilometres would be needed. Carbon Tracker said the space needed to host enough solar panels to power the world is actually less than the land required for fossil fuels today, which in the United States alone is 126,000 square kilometres, or 1.3% of the country.
At wind and solar’s current growth rate of between 15% to 20%, the think tank said that fossil fuels could be pushed out of the electricity sector by the mid-2030s and out of total energy supply by 2050.

Countries in the global south are the greatest beneficiaries of the shift toward solar and wind.
“They have the largest ratio of solar and wind potential to energy demand and stand to unlock huge domestic benefits,” Carbon Tracker said. “The continent of Africa for example is a renewables superpower, with 39% of global potential.”
More specifically, countries such as Namibia have a renewables potential that is more than 1,000 times their energy demand. On the other end of the spectrum are countries like South Korea, which has a potential that is just 10 times its energy demand.

Germany is another example of a country with low potential and high demand. It has the third-lowest solar and wind resources in the world compared to its total demand. That is, Germany is not very sunny, but it is densely populated and has high energy demand. Nonetheless, it’s a global renewables leader.
“If the Germans can find solutions, then so can everyone else,” Carbon Tracker said.

Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. (MSEDCL) has opened up bidding to develop an aggregate 1.3 GW (AC) of ground-mounted solar capacity across 29 districts in the Indian state of Maharashtra. 
The projects are to be set up under the “Mukhyamantri Saur Krishi Vahini Yojana” program, which is designed to give daytime power to agricultural consumers. Foreign companies, registered according to the rules of their countries of origin, will also be allowed to participate in the bidding process.
MSEDCL will enter into 25-year power purchase agreements with the successful developers. The maximum tariff payable to the developers has been fixed at INR 3.05 $0.04) per unit for the entire duration of the PPAs.
The winning developers will be responsible for project design, financing, land procurement, engineering, construction, operation and maintenance.
“Projects under construction, projects which are not yet commissioned and projects already commissioned but do not have any long-term PPA with any agency, and selling power on short-term or merchant plant basis shall be eligible,” the state authorities said in the tender document.
