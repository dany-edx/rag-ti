The two companies have been working together to build and operate virtual power plants (VPP) for mid-sized businesses faced with the challenges of electric vehicle fleets and electric heating.
Electrofleet provides capital, as well as equipment and services, to upgrade its customers’ facilities so they can use renewable energy at fixed prices in long term contracts. It uses Energiekoppler's energy management software to aggregate and integrate systems based on fuel cells, heat pumps, photovoltaic systems or storage technologies into the VPP infrastructure.
Energiekoppler's flagship product, Flexibility Plant, sits between the customer's energy device, or asset, and the marketer who actively trades on the electricity exchange. “We realize plant connections for direct and flexibility marketers,” Energiekoppler's spokesperson told pv magazine.
One of the benefits of the technology is that it enables both small and large installations to be connected and marketed as a portfolio on the energy exchange, added the spokesperson.
Electrofleet counts Weller Gruppe, owner of a large German car dealership, as one of its first customers. “Fleet operators face incredible capital cost challenges in making the transition, and our model takes some of that pressure off by upgrading grid access and re-charging capacity at no capital cost to the customer themselves,” Electrofleet’s spokesperson told pv magazine.
The contract with Weller Gruppe entailed the installation of 9 MW of solar PV and 80 MWh of storage capacity at automobile dealer’s sites with a 20-year fixed price agreement.
According to the Electrofleet spokesperson, the target group is companies with a consumption of between 100,000 kWh and 500,000 kWh per year and who are converting fleets from fossil fuels to electricity, “anyone highly exposed to energy price volatility.” These could be logistics companies, retail chains, car dealerships, or production facilities. “It is important that there is sufficient roof space or open space available for the installation of PV systems,” noted the spokesperson. In addition, Electrofleet has concluded power purchase agreements (PPA) with ProWind, based in Osnabrück.
Energiekoppler's series A venture capital round was completed in November. The capital will be used to develop its products and to expand its sales activities. Early investors are Cottbus, Germany-based energy group LEAG, which was also an early customer, and compatriot Technologiegründerfonds Sachsen (TGFS). An undisclosed amount was raised. It has a software-as-a-service business model.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/15/new-solid-state-battery-charges-in-minutes-lasts-for-thousands-of-cycles/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 15, 2024","New solid state battery charges in minutes, lasts for thousands of cycles","Lithium metal batteries could offer far better energy density and much lower weight than lithium-ion technology thanks to the replacement of heavier graphite with lithium metal as anode. However, one of the biggest challenges in the design of these batteries is the formation of dendrites on the anode’s surface, causing the battery to rapidly degrade, short, and even catch fire.
Researchers at Harvard John A. Paulson SEAS have developed a new lithium metal battery that withstand at least 6,000 charging cycles and can be recharged in a matter of minutes.
Their research not only describes a new way to make solid state batteries with a lithium metal anode but also offers new understanding into the interface reaction between lithium and materials at the anode in these type of batteries.
“Lithium metal anode batteries are considered the holy grail of batteries because they have ten times the capacity of commercial graphite anodes and could drastically increase the driving distance of electric vehicles,” said Xin Li, Associate Professor of Materials Science at SEAS and senior author of the paper. “Our research is an important step toward more practical solid-state batteries for industrial and commercial applications.”
In 2021, Li and his team offered one way to deal with dendrites by designing a multilayer battery that sandwiched different materials of varying stabilities between the anode and cathode. This multilayer, multi-material design prevented the penetration of lithium dendrites not by stopping them altogether, but rather by controlling and containing them.
In the new research, Li and his team stop dendrites from forming by using micron-sized silicon particles in the anode to constrict the lithiation reaction and facilitate homogeneous plating of a thick layer of lithium metal.
In this design, when lithium ions move from the cathode to the anode during charging, the lithiation reaction is constricted at the shallow surface and the ions attach to the surface of the silicon particle but do not penetrate further.
“In our design, lithium metal gets wrapped around the silicon particle, like a hard chocolate shell around a hazelnut core in a chocolate truffle,” said Li.
These coated particles create a homogenous surface across which the current density is evenly distributed, preventing the growth of dendrites. And, because plating and stripping can happen quickly on an even surface, the battery can recharge in only about 10 minutes.
The researchers built a postage stamp-sized pouch cell version of the battery, which is 10 to 20 times larger than the coin cell made in most university labs. The battery retained 80% of its capacity after 6,000 cycles, outperforming other pouch cell batteries on the market today, the reserchers reported in Fast cycling of lithium metal in solid-state batteries by constriction-susceptible anode materials published in nature materials.
The technology has been licensed through Harvard Office of Technology Development to Adden Energy, a Harvard spinoff company cofounded by Li and three Harvard alumni. The company has scaled up the technology to build a smart phone-sized pouch cell battery.
Li and his team also characterized the properties that allow silicon to constrict the diffusion of lithium to facilitate the dynamic process favoring homogeneous plating of thick lithium. They then defined a unique property descriptor to describe such a process and computed it for all known inorganic materials. In doing so, the team revealed dozens of other materials that could potentially yield similar performance.
“Previous research had found that other materials, including silver, could serve as good materials at the anode for solid state batteries,” said Li. “Our research explains one possible underlying mechanism of the process and provides a pathway to identify new materials for battery design.”

The projects will range in size from 140 kW to 2.4 MW and are located in Tokyo, Chiba, Yamanashi, Gifu, Shiga, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Nara, and Wakayama. The project developer is Sun Trinity, a joint venture between Sumitomo and Shikoku Electric.
The companies said that solar carports tend to be more expensive than rooftop installations, but they expect costs to be competitive due to the high volume. They provided few details about the PV technology, but said the carports are designed to maximize car space, using bifacial modules with minimal load-bearing columns.
The partners said they plan to eventually install solar carports at more than 50 stores across Japan by 2025.
Aeon Mall said its long-term aim is to secure more locally produced, locally consumed renewable energy via PPAs covering wind, hydrogen, and battery energy storage systems.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/15/czechias-records-970-mw-of-new-solar-in-2023/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,CZECHIA",PATRICK JOWETT,"JANUARY 15, 2024",Czechia records 970 MW of new solar in 2023,"Czechia built around 1 GW of new PV plants in 2023, according to data from the Czech Solar Association (Solární Asociace).
In total, 82,799 solar power plants were connected to the grid, with a combined total output of 970 MW. The nation achieved a record-breaking year with 145% growth, connecting 49,000 more power plants than it did in 2022.
The figures mark a period of rapid growth in Czechia’s solar market. The growth has been largely driven by residential PV, with most of the new installations (80,069) being domestic PV plants, supported by the country investing an additional CZK 55 billion ($2.5 billion) in its New Green Savings program back in March 2023.
The total output of all the country’s solar plants reached almost 3.5 GW at the end of December. More than 170,000 PV plants now supply electricity to the grid, of which more than 150,000 are on the rooftops of family homes.
Looking forward, the trade body said it expects investors to shift their focus to larger-scale solar power plants. It said this move will be subsidized for the corporate segment of the Modernisation Fund and should significantly speed up the administration of projects and their construction. In 2023, 25 power plants with a capacity exceeding 1 MW were connected to the network in Czechia, alongside the first solar park connections since 2011.
“Today's growth is driven by rooftop power plants for family homes or companies,” the association's executive director, Jan Krčmář, told pv magazine. “However, if we want to use the potential of solar energy in the Czech Republic and, above all, to prepare for the very real scenario that coal-fired power plants will be shut down earlier than expected, we must add to the construction of solar parks.”
Czechia struggled with grid issues in 2023 and the absence of large energy storage continues to be a problem. In production plants above 1 MWp, the ratio of battery storage capacity to installed PV power was only 1.4%, which the association said is “critically low.” It blamed both the lack of legislation and the setting of the conditions of subsidy programs.
Jan Fousek, the chairman of Solární Asociace, said “the full use of electricity accumulation should be enabled by another amendment to the Energy Act …  The newly announced calls for the Modernisation Fund, on which we have long-term cooperation with the State Environmental Fund and the Ministry of the Environment, will already include higher point benefits for projects with accumulation. I hope that the share of large projects with large-capacity storage will start to increase soon thanks to these changes, otherwise we have a problem.”
One answer could lie with agrovoltaics, according to Jiří Bím, an agrovoltaics analyst.
“The decisive factor will be whether the necessary legislation can be adopted this year in a form that will enable the development of agrovoltaics as we know it from abroad,” said Bím.
In contrast to its large-scale energy storage issues, Czechia is among the European leaders in the use of domestic batteries in proportion to the installed power ranks for residential PV.
“For the future, home batteries offer a huge potential for aggregating flexibility to stabilize the system,” Fousek explained. “What only a few years ago sounded like science fiction, today even some domestic companies routinely do it.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/15/hungarys-2023-solar-capacity-additions-hit-1-6-gw/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,HUNGARY",PATRICK JOWETT,"JANUARY 15, 2024",Hungary’s 2023 solar capacity additions hit 1.6 GW,"Hungary deployed 1.6 GW of solar in 2023, according to new figures released by the Hungarian government. Last year’s increase is a calendar-year record for Hungary and more than one and half times the capacity additions recorded in 2022.
It takes the country’s total solar capacity to more than 5.6 GW. Preliminary figures from transmission system manager MAVIR states Hungary’s total solar capacity equate to 3.3 GW of industrial solar power plants and 2.3 GW of household-sized installations.
Hungary posted growth in terms of large-scale and residential solar capacity last year. The country’s largest solar power plant to date was connected to the grid, while the number of small, household-sized power plants surpassed a quarter of a million. According to census data, more than one-quarter of residential properties of at least 100 square meters built after 2010 now have solar panels.
In 2024, the Hungarian government says it will continue to support the growth of residential PV through the soon-to-be-launched Napenergia Plusz Program, a grant scheme for the installation of modern solar panel and storage systems with a total budget of HUF 75.8 billion ($218 million). The scheme, which is expected to support over 15,000 households, opens for applications later this month.
Kinga Máté, a Hungarian legal analyst, told pv magazine that the additional 1.6 GW is a “significant and commendable achievement,” but warned “the tightening of foreign direct investment (FDI) rules, particularly the introduction of a pre-emption right for the Hungarian State in solar power plant investments, presents a notable challenge.”
“Another novelty introduced by the amendment of the FDI Decree is the more precise description of the solar investments concerned, namely strategic companies that are to be acquired by a foreign investor and have electricity generation registered as their main or other activity in the company register,” Máté said. “These restrictive measures may dampen the enthusiasm of foreign investors, potentially limiting the scope of international transactions in Hungary's renewable energy sector. It is a factor that should be considered in every business strategy.”
There are also concerns that grid congestion could hamper the rollout of large-scale solar in Hungary. In June, the president of the Hungarian Photovoltaic Industry Association, Ádám Szolnoki, told pv magazine that 3 GW of projects that submitted applications in 2022 were told in May that that would not be able to connect before 2028. But he said there is ab0ut 5 GW of allocated utility-scale PV capacity set for construction in Hungary over the next four to five years.
Hungary has set a target of 12 GW of solar capacity by the start of the next decade.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/15/ev-owners-more-likely-to-install-rooftop-solar-on-homes/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",KAVYA BALARAMAN,"JANUARY 15, 2024",EV owners more likely to install rooftop solar,"Owners of EVs are more likely to add solar panels to their homes, according to a new behavioral study analysis from the US Department of Energy’s NREL.
The study, funded by the Department of Energy’s Vehicle Technologies Office, was based on a survey of 869 households in the San Francisco Bay area, first in 2018 and then again in 2022. It found that around about one-quarter of EV owners also own PV systems, while only 8% of people who do not own EVs have adopted distributed solar.
EV owners might have a tendency to also install solar since solar panels could help offset the energy costs of charging their vehicles at home, said Shivam Sharda, a computational research scientist at NREL’s Center for Integrated Mobility Sciences, and lead author of the study.
“Both EVs and PVs have a complementary nature, which might play a pivotal role in energy systems resiliency, addressing concerns regarding grid stability and power management strategies,” added Sharda.
On the flip side, the researchers found that owning solar panels could also influence whether homeowners buy EVs, although that correlation is not as strong.
Two aspects that could encourage a consumer to adopt either solar or EVs, or both include being aware of the technologies, and being social enough to ask about them, the study determined. For instance, if someone has a friend or family member who owns a rooftop solar panel or EV, they become more educated about the technology and its pros and cons, thereby influencing their decisions, said Sharda.
From a policy perspective, while governments currently incentivize the adoption of both EVs and rooftop solar, the study recommended implementing strategies that could accelerate the deployment of the two technologies jointly.
“Because EV owners are inclined to use PV anyway, such incentives might provide a push for EV owners to adopt solar technology much earlier than what is currently observed,” NREL said. “How soon a household adopts cross-sectoral sustainable technologies will play an important role in achieving decarbonization goals.”
The study also highlighted the need for additional holistic surveys to better understand the nexus of transportation and residential energy use.
A 2021 consumer report from SolarReviews found that an EV would cost about  $1,058 per year when using a public charger, but that costs drop to as little as $415 annually with home solar – compared to the $1,260 a year it costs to fuel a traditional, gas-powered car. The report compared a gas-powered Hyundai Kona with an all-electric one, and found that during a 13,500-mile year, the former would cost $1,260 to fuel, while the latter, when charged at home, could cost around $662 per year in California and $450 annually in a state like Florida. In fact, over a 25-year period, charging an EV with home solar could save the owner some $16,250, the study concluded.

Since the beginning of 2023, TÜV Süd has offered solar rooftop checks so homeowners and businesses can determine whether their properties are structurally suitable for PV systems.
The company has released the results of a survey conducted in 2023. Only one-quarter of rooftops are suitable for PV systems without restrictions. On 8% of rooftops, it is not possible to install solar modules for structural reasons.
The sample examined by TÜV Süd is relatively small, at about 50 rooftops, but includes different kinds of structures. They included tiled pitched roofs of single-family homes, as well as complex roof systems on industrial buildings and residential complexes with various types of roof sealing
Roof coverings and roof sealing must be taken into account when deciding whether to deploy a PV system. For flat roofs, it is particularly important to carefully examine the existing structure, including the roof sealing and insulation, and the possible effects of the planned change of use before building a PV system.
TÜV SÜD uses different criteria to analyze in advance whether rooftop surfaces are suitable for solar modules. After installation, it checks compliance with all structural requirements. It says the basic price for a rooftop with a maximum area of 200 square meters is €1,500 ($1,640).

The Desert-to-Power initiative is supporting the development of 10 GW of solar and storage in the 11 countries of the Sahel, a semi-arid region on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert, stretching across the African continent from Senegal to Ethiopia.
To effectively integrate this new capacity, Mauritania and Mali plan to build a high-voltage electrical interconnection linking their two countries across 1,373 kilometers. It will connect Mauritania to Chad, via Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.
The 225 kV line between Mauritania and Mali will have a capacity of 600 MW and will be associated with the development of solar plants planned in the region. The interconnection project is accompanied by the construction of a 50 MW PV array in Kiffa, Mauritania. This will connect 100,000 new households (80,000 in Mauritania and 20,000 in Mali) to the electricity network in the localities crossed.
“The approval of this project shows that the Desert-to-Power Initiative is gradually coming to fruition through structuring projects which will make it possible to develop means of producing renewable energy in both countries,” said Daniel Schroth, director of renewable energy for the African Development Bank.
The interconnection project will benefit from the financing of $302.9 million validated at the end of December 2023 by the African Development Fund (ADF). Around 90% of this will be devoted to Mauritania and 10% for Mali.

Their research included an economic analysis of both remote sensing-based approaches for diagnostic and fault detection.
“The use of aerial drones expedites the detection of faults within a large solar PV plant. However, if the IR camera is not fast, the drone’s moving speed must be relatively low to avoid smearing effects,” the group explained. “An airplane can cover a very large area in a shorter time, resulting in more cost-efficient flights. On the other hand, due to the carrier speed, the IR camera requires high resolution and a higher number of acquired frames per second. These are typically found in cooled thermal cameras, which are much more expensive than standard uncooled cameras.”
For their experiment, the researchers used the DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise Advanced UAV and a human-crewed airplane P2006T SMP. Both have surveyed two PV plants in northern Italy twice and at the same time. System 1 comprises 4347 polycrystalline silicon PV modules, while System 2 comprises 4158 polycrystalline silicon PV modules. Both have an installed capacity of about 1 MW.
In all of its flights, the UAV has used a DJI M2EA thermal camera having an uncooled 640 × 512 microbolometer detector, operating in the 8–14 μm wavelength range. The human-crewed airplane used in the first flight a FLIR A8580 with a 1280 × 1024 cooled sensor operating in the 7.5–12.5 μm wavelength range, while in the second flight, it used a FLIR X8581 InSb, 1280 × 1024 cooled sensor operating in a different wavelength range of 3–5 μm.

“The rationale behind using a different thermal camera during the second airplane inspection was to permit the comparison between thermal patterns obtained by two IR cameras with different spectral responses, specifically the long infrared wavelength range (LW) for the drone and the medium infrared wavelength range (MW) for the airplane,” the academics explained.
Collected visual and thermal images were processed on a computer, identifying and categorizing thermal abnormalities in the PV plants.
“Regarding the most critical defects, such as defective substring, entire module, and a string of modules, 99.6 % of them were detected by both aerial platforms. Furthermore, 87.3 % of modules with single or multiple hotspots, identified by UAV surveys, were also detected by airplane inspections,” the researchers emphasized. “Overall, about 98 % of thermal defects captured by drone inspections were confirmed by airplane inspections, with only a 0.23 K difference in temperature delta.”
The group concluded that the results show excellent agreement, which is encouraging regarding using an aircraft. With those results, the scientists went on to do a comparative analysis of costs.

“While UAV-based inspections, which are the market standard, entail daily equipment and workforce costs not as high as those of the airplane, the latter platform, however, allows for coverage of a larger daily area,” they said. “This implies that a threshold value, based on the size (and capacity) of the inspected plants, is likely to determine which technique is more economically viable.”
Per the Italian test case, the daily cost of a UAV is €800 ($876), inclusive of the expenses for the operators and the uncooled thermal camera rental. Furthermore, the rental cost for the aircraft, including the pilot, is  €2,700 per day and €120 for the cooled camera. However, it can be assumed that the UAV platform can inspect a maximum of about 20 MW in a single working day, while the airplane can do 300 MW.
“The results show that for inspections of any plant requiring more than two working days, and that the use of the airplane is economically more convenient,” the academics said. “Furthermore, the threshold decreases (and conditions for aircraft use become more favorable) if the same amount of PV power is spread across a cluster of smaller plants in the same region.”
The results were presented in “Infrared thermography monitoring of solar photovoltaic systems: A comparison between UAV and aircraft remote sensing platforms,” published in Thermal Science and Engineering Progress.

The Paris-based organization noted that ambitious project announcements should be followed by consistent demand-supporting policies to to satisfy investors.
Airbus has opened a ZEROe Development Centre (ZEDC) for hydrogen technologies at its Stade site in Germany. “The center will accelerate the development of composite hydrogen-system technologies for storing and distributing cryogenic liquid hydrogen,” said the aerospace group, noting that the ZEDC is supported by public funds. It will complement other Airbus sites in Germany, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The company says it wants to put a hydrogen-powered plane in the sky by 2035.
Gascade Gastransport has signed a grid-connection agreement with HH2E's green hydrogen production site in Lubmin, Germany. The site in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is expected to start production by the end of 2025. The production plant will be connected to the European Gas Pipeline Link (EUGAL Lines 1 and 2), which will initially transport a blend of natural gas and green hydrogen. The onshore pipeline Flow stretches to southern Germany and is part of the country's core hydrogen network. The hydrogen-blending contract is the first of its kind for both companies. 
Wood Mackenzie said clarity is emerging in key parts of the world, potentially unlocking early growth in the hydrogen sector this year. The focus will shift to projects progressing toward final investment decisions (FID), with Japan and South Korea expected to reveal subsidy schemes and emissions thresholds early in the year. The consultancy anticipates supportive policies for blue ammonia imports in these markets, facilitating faster market scaling at a lower cost. Despite needed clarity from a US Department of the Treasury decision on Dec. 22, 2023, the United States could still face delays in manufacturing scale-up and projects going online.
MIT researchers have proposed a phased approach for US hydrogen projects, focusing on tax credits under the US Inflation Reduction Act. In the initial phase, green hydrogen produced with grid electricity should receive credits under looser standards. As hydrogen demand grows, the industry should adhere to stricter standards, ensuring electricity comes from renewable sources. Over the long term, when the grid relies mainly on renewable energy, standards could loosen again, the researchers wrote in “The influence of additionality and time-matching requirements on the emissions from grid-connected hydrogen production,” which was recently published in Nature Energy. The researchers noted the importance of “time matching” and “additionality,” and said adaptive rules should align with evolving market conditions and industry changes.

It is interesting to examine the impact of widespread deployment of PV (and wind) on wholesale electricity prices.
Most of the Australian population lives on the eastern seaboard and is served by the National Electricity Market (NEM). This comprises a distribution system some 3000 kilometres long, but only a few hundred kilometres wide, and serves about 20 million people. There is no connection to other electricity grids and so the NEM must “go it alone” with sufficient storage. Solar and wind electricity cannot be traded for fossil, nuclear or hydroelectricity from other countries.
In 2023, generation shares in the NEM were coal (56%), solar (18%), wind (13%), hydro (7%) and other fossil fuels (6%). New fossil fuel capacity deployment essentially stopped a decade ago, and solar and wind deployment rapidly accelerated from 2018. The NEM is a relatively open electricity market. People can freely connect to the NEM provided that safety and grid stability requirements are met. The solar and wind shares are rapidly rising as private companies and individuals take advantage of the low and declining cost of renewable electricity. Australian grid stability is excellent.
Figure 1 shows the average NEM wholesale electricity spot price (blue bars) and the renewable electricity fraction (red line) over the 12-year period 2012-2023. Prices are corrected for inflation and are translated into current US dollars.

There is no obvious correlation between the electricity market spot price and the rise and rise of solar and wind. Australia is a major exporter of coal and gas, and world parity prices prevail in Australia. The large price spike in 2022 and into 2023 mirrored the global price spike in fossil fuels following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
In an alignment of political, environmental and economic good sense, the Australian Government and all the provincial governments agree that rapid progress towards a renewable-dominated grid is required. Considerations include: all Australian regions have access to good wind and/or solar; the largest risk to stability of electricity supply is a sudden and unexpected failure of coal power stations, most of which are reaching the end of their technical lives.; the largest risk of future price spikes similar to 2022 comes from global fossil fuel market prices; and the easiest and quickest way to make large reductions in emissions to help meet international greenhouse commitments is to push coal and gas out of electricity production.
Rooftop solar is being deployed by millions of house owners and businesses, driven by the very low cost of rooftop solar electricity compared with the retail tariff. About one third of houses now has a rooftop solar system. Solar farms and wind farms are being widely deployed close to existing transmission. However, it is proving difficult to deploy new transmission to service new solar and wind farms due to local opposition. This creates risk for solar and wind farm developers. This problem is being mitigated through sharply increased compensation for hosts of new transmission, and the development of renewable energy zones (REZ) with dedicated transmission corridors.
Although solar and wind have a compelling cost advantage over fossil fuel alternatives, there are serious risks with adequate transmission and storage. Recently, the national Government decided to mitigate risks by holding reverse auctions every six months for new solar and wind capacity. These auctions entail companies competing for a specified price range for electricity. If wholesale electricity prices are below the price range, then the government will make up the difference. If prices are above the price range, then the difference is payable to the government. Companies that offer a lower price than competitors will generally win a contract, which puts downwards pressure on prices. Sufficient capacity will be auctioned over 2024-27 to reach the Government target of 82% renewable electricity in 2030.

This is due to measurements using “transient photoluminescence,” a novel method developed by Thomas Kirchartz and his team at the Institute for Energy and Climate Research (IEK-5) at Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany.
When light hits a solar cell, electrons are released from their bonds and raised from the valence band, in which an electron hole is then created, to the conduction band. If this excited state lasts long enough, the electrons come into electrical contact and release energy. However, if they fall back into the valence band too early, they cannot contribute to the current flow. This recombination, which is primarily triggered by defects in the crystal lattice, “is the essential loss process in every solar cell,” said Kirchartz.
According to previous assumptions, recombination occurs primarily due to “deep defects” in the middle of the bandgap between the valence and power bands. This assumption is probably correct for most types of solar cells, but it has been disproven for perovskite solar cells: During the measurements, the research team found that the “shallow defects” near the valence or conduction band are crucial for recombination.
“The cause of this unusual behavior has not yet been fully clarified,” Kirchartz said. “It is reasonable to assume that deep defects simply cannot exist in these materials. This restriction may also be one of the reasons for the particularly high efficiency of the cells.”
The group published its findings in “Shallow defects and variable photoluminescence decay times up to 280 µs in triple-cation perovskites,” which was recently published in Nature Materials. 
“We show that the features indicative for shallow defects seen in the bare films remain dominant in finished devices and are therefore also crucial to understanding the performance of perovskite solar cells,” the research team said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/15/perovskite-silicon-tandem-solar-modules-must-ensure-degradation-rate-of-0-4-year-to-compete-with-crystalline-silicon/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SAUDI ARABIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 15, 2024",Perovskite-silicon tandem solar modules must ensure degradation rate of 0.4%/year to compete with crystalline silicon,"Researchers at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia have outlined a roadmap for the commercialization of perovskite-silicon tandem solar technologies in an effort to speed up the development of what the industry and the scientific research sees as the most likely candidate to represent the “next-generation” PV products.
In the paper “Pathways toward commercial perovskite/silicon tandem photovoltaics,” which was recently published in Science, the scientists explained that for perovskite-silicon tandem solar modules to become competitive with their PERC or TOPCon counterparts, they will have to show an efficiency exceeding 32 %, and their production cost should not be 30% higher than the cost of producing mainstream products.
The academics assumed a lifecycle of 25 years and different variable module costs for their LCOE comparison. They also found that perovskite-silicon modules must ensure a relative degradation rate of 0.4%/year to become competitive with conventional panels.
“The point we try to make is that it is critical to get annual degradation rates well below 1% relative, else you will need to have very high module efficiencies to start with. So working on stability is of extreme importance to get a competitive LCOE,” the research lead author, Stefaan De Woolf, told pv magazine, noting that this value highlights the importance and urgency of improving perovskite-silicon tandem tech stability.
The research team said future efforts will have to be particularly devoted to developing specific accelerated degradation tests and outdoor tests for accurate field-performance prediction and evaluation.
“The authors suggest geographical testing – akin to personalized medicine for solar cells – to optimize performance for specific locations,” the KAUST said in a statement. “The deployed solar cells must have a lifespan that lasts decades. Accordingly, tests that compress years of wear and tear into a much shorter timeframe are necessary. Understanding degradation rates is crucial for setting competitive prices and warranties.”
The proposed roadmap describes the current perovskite-silicon tandem cell configurations and their possible advances, as well as all technology used for perovskite film deposition. It also includes insight into module encapsulation and an overview of consortia and companies developing monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.
“The market for perovskite-silicon tandems is expected to exceed $10 billion within a decade,” De Wolf said. “In 2023, our laboratory reported two world records for power conversion efficiency, with five achieved globally in the same year, showing rapid progress in perovskite-silicon tandem technology.”
In May, the KAUST achieved a power conversion efficiency of 33.7% for a perovskite-silicon solar cell. A few months earlier, it had announced a power conversion efficiency of 28.1% for a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell based on textured silicon wafers. In August 2022, it claimed a 26.2% efficiency for a monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem photovoltaic device.

The South Australia Country Fire Service (CFS) has confirmed that a contractor was taken to hospital for treatment of burns after an inverter in a shipping container ignited at Epic Energy’s Mannum solar farm, causing an estimated AUD 250,000 ($167,170) of damages.
The CFS said 10 firefighters last week after an emergency call about an inverter in “bursting into flames” at the solar farm site. The facility, which is being developed adjacent to Epic’s initial 5 MW Mannum Solar Farm, is currently undergoing commissioning, following the completion of construction last year.
“CFS crews managed to keep the fire contained to the shipping container and stop it spreading to nearby solar panels,” CFS said in a statement. “A contractor on site has been taken to hospital for treatment and SAPOL (South Australian Police) investigators have attended the site to conduct a workplace safety report.”
In a statement shared with pv magazine, Epic Chief Executive Officer Clive D’Cruz said the company’s principal contractor is “working with SafeWork SA to investigate the incident … We are offering our support to our principal contractor and wish the injured personnel a full and speedy recovery. The safety of our staff and contractors is Epic Energy’s highest priority.”
D’Cruz said repairs will be “undertaken as quickly and safely as possible” as the commissioning process continues.
The stage two expansion of the solar farm is located adjacent to the Mannum 33/132 kV substation and will operate independently from the initial 5 MW stage, which has been operating since 2019, as it has an independent connection to the SA Power Networks distribution grid.
The incident follows Epic’s announcement this week that it will build a 100 MW/200 MWh standalone battery energy storage system alongside its solar farms at Mannum. Construction of the battery is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2024, with completion scheduled for the second half of 2025.

EmPower Solar, a New York-based commercial solar developer and installer, recently furloughed 40% of its workforce into 2025, and others into 2026. The move came one week after employees voted to join the United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 259.
According to union documents filed with the National Labor Relations Board, a vote was taken on Dec. 21, 2023, by 49 EmPower Solar employees, driven by concerns over working conditions and safety, as well as job security and equitable compensation. Of the votes, 29 were in favor of unionizing, 16 were opposed, one vote was challenged, and the last few votes were left uncounted.
Only two days before the official union vote, Empower Solar filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that the union engaged in “coercion, incl’g statements or acts of violence,” in violation of Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).
