According to the press release, the companies won the contract after submitting “the most cost-competitive bid” of $16.84/MWh as part of the fourth round of the Middle Eastern country’s National Renewable Energy Program auction. The plant is expected to reach financial close in early 2024 and will be connected to the grid in 2025, the announcement stated.
SPPC, a government-run department tasked with granting energy project tenders, said in its own press release that the project’s levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is SAR 6.31575 ($1.68420)/kWh.
Masdar is a renewable energy company based in Saudi Arabia. EDF Renewables develops renewable energy projects and is a subsidiary of France-based utility EDF Group. Nesma Home Company is a venture capital company based in Saudi Arabia.
The two announcements did not specify what solar technology would be used and on what date the agreement was signed.
In 2020, Saudi Arabia derived 51% of its energy supply from gas and 49% from oil, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The country has increased its installed solar capacity since that year – only 59 MW – to 389 MW in 2021 and 390 MW in 2022, according to other IRENA stats.
Saudi Arabia plans to generate 50% of its energy from renewables by 2030.

However, their path to commercialization is paved with challenges, including the need to overcome the narrow electrochemical window in aqueous systems and the poor ionic conductivity in non-aqueous systems.
Now, a research team in HKU's Department of Mechanical Engineering has designed a quasi-solid-state magnesium-ion battery boasting a voltage plateau at 2.4 V and an energy density of 264 Wh/kg, surpassing the performance of current magnesium-ion batteries, and almost matching the performance of lithium-ion batteries.
Previously, the same research team developed a water-in-salt magnesium-ion battery with an operating voltage above 2 V. Yet, it still lagged behind non-aqueous counterparts due to the dominance of proton over Mg-ion storage in the cathode.
“Hydrogen ions, or protons, are smaller and lighter compared to the metal ions. Because of their size, protons can easily get into the battery's cathode structure. However, this creates a problem because protons and magnesium ions compete for space, which severely limits how much energy the battery can store and how long it can last,” said Sarah Leong, a HKU researcher and the study's first author.
The researchers have improved on the earlier design implementing a polymer-enhanced electrolyte to control the competition between protons and metal ions and confine the hydrogen bond network.
“It is a game-changing development,” said HKU Professor Dennis Y.C. Leung. “Our quasi-solid-state magnesium-ion battery combines the best of both worlds, offering the high voltage of non-aqueous systems and the safety and cost-effectiveness of aqueous systems. It represents a major step forward in the development of high-performance magnesium-ion batteries.”
In extensive cycling tests, the research team found that even under extreme conditions of subzero temperatures (-22°C), the quasi-solid-state magnesium-ion battery retained 90% of its capacity after 900 cycles.
The battery is also non-flammable and resistant to high pressure loading, which makes it a promising candidate for consumer electronics, even in colder climates.
“The advanced electrolyte development strategy presented in our research holds potential beyond magnesium-ion batteries, extending to other multivalent metal ion batteries, such as zinc-ion and aluminium-ion batteries,” said HKU Assistant Professor Wending Pan. “We believe that this study will pave the way for the next generation of energy storage solutions that are not only efficient but also environmentally friendly.”
Their findings are discussed in “Next-generation magnesium-ion batteries: The quasi-solid-state approach to multivalent metal ion storage,” which was recently published in Science Advances.

The islands are the last inhabited locations before the North Pole and are immersed in darkness throughout the winter.
The system consists of a series of rooftop PV systems and a ground-mounted installation. It is located near Isfjord Radio, a radio station built in 1933 as a communication point between Svalbard and the mainland. Today, it also a base camp for tourists, which is only accessible by boat or helicopter.
Mons Ole Sellevold, renewables project manager for Store Norske Energi AS, told pv magazine that the pilot project could reduce the use of fossil fuels by 70% and serve as a model for Arctic communities' transition to renewable energy.
“For the ground-mounted photovoltaic system, 360 bifacial photovoltaic panels were installed, each with a power of 550 W for a total of 198 kW system and an expected energy production of 161,000 kWh/year,” Sellevold said. “For the rooftop photovoltaic system, divided into three different buildings, the panels installed are of 231 W and 415 W each and the total installed capacity is 96 kW with an estimated energy production of 60,000 kWh/year”
The project manager also provided the details of the battery storage system.
“The battery storage reaches 405 kWh while the inverter capacity is 240 kW. There is also thermal storage: 12,000 liters of hot water in 12 storage tanks.”
Regarding the works, as expected, the Isfjord Radio construction site was challenging.
“The foundations had to be poured into permafrost and the work was carried out in difficult arctic conditions, with snowdrifts and loads of wind, snow and ice,” Sellevold explained. “Furthermore, the work had to be carried out with as little disruption to tourists and wildlife as possible.”
Before the start of the energy transition, Isfjord Radio used almost 200,000 liters of diesel per year. So far, the installation of a battery bank and a thermal storage system has significantly reduced diesel consumption. It is expected that with solar panels in operation, there will be a 70% reduction in the use of fossil fuels.
“We are well underway in establishing Isfjord Radio as a pilot for emissions-free hybrid energy systems for off-grid communities in the Arctic,” Store Norske Energi CEO Heidi Theresa Ose told pv magazine. “The long-term goal is to arrive at a completely renewable solution.”
Isfjord Radio relies on an autonomous energy system, where hybrid solutions including renewable energy production, energy storage and diesel generators are being tested, which can then be deployed in many of the approximately 1,500 Arctic communities not connected to one central energy grid and rely mainly on coal or diesel as an energy source. “
“Our shared responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, security of supply, secure energy production, and the particularly high costs of fossil energy in the Arctic are critical considerations and driving forces of this energy transition,” the company said in a press release.

PCMs can absorb, store, and release large amounts of latent heat over defined temperature ranges. They have often been used at the research level for PV module cooling and the storage of heat.
The researchers explained that their new heat pump concept is intended for demand shifting in space heating and domestic hot water (DHW) applications. It consists of a heat pump, the PCM tank, and tube solar heat collectors.
“Unlike conventional bare/unglazed solar collectors, the evacuated tube collectors demonstrate superior performance in cold and low solar radiation areas/seasons,” the academics said, referring to the solar-thermal technology they chose. “By adopting evacuated tube collectors, the system can overcome the negative impact of cold weather conditions and function optimally day and night.”
The heat pump consists of a compressor, a condenser, an expansion valve, and an evaporator. Its hot water outlet temperature reaches up to 73 C for various heating loads, and its water flow rate is constant at 0.32 kg/s. The storage tank is a conventional cylindrical tank with the PCM tubes being immersed inside to enhance its heat capacity.
In the proposed system configuration, the collectors act as an evaporator of the refrigerant in the heat pump. The evaporated refrigerant is then conveyed to the compressor, where its pressure and temperature increase. This working fluid is then condensed in a heat exchanger. At a later stage, its temperature and pressure are lowered by the expansion valve.
“The PCM charging process is limited to solar hours since the heat pump can only operate during this period,” the academics explained, adding that the high-temperature heat provided by the solar collectors is transferred to a hot water loop, connected to the PCM storage tank, where the circulated water heats the PCM tubes. “As a result, the system enforces load shifting from peak times to daytime, aligning with solar energy availability.”
According to the research team, after it is fully charged, the water tank can store hot water at temperatures of up to 70 C, with the PCM temperature reaching up to 58 C. This water can be used during the nighttime or even to cover the early morning peak load, without substantial temperature decreases, the group said.
The scientists conducted a series of simulations considering a tube collector area of 31 m2, solar irradiance of 150 W/m2, and an ambient temperature of −5 C. They found the system was able to achieve a coefficient of performance (COP) of 2.3 and a 6 kW heating output. “When the heating output is reduced by 1 kW, or when the ambient temperature increases to 8 °C, the system's COP demonstrates a significant increase of 13% in both scenarios,” they added.
Compared to conventional heat pumps, the system was also found to reduce electricity consumption by 9.4% on a low solar day. “For one month of operation, the overall COP of the DX-SAHP and conventional HP units were found 3.98 and 2.33, respectively,” the researchers concluded.
The proposed system was presented in the study “Direct-expansion solar-assisted heat pump coupled with crystallisation-controlled supercooled PCM for shifting building electricity demand,” published in Energy and Buildings. The research group also includes scientists from the Hubei University of Technology in China.

Thanks to PV systems and battery storage, millions of households in Europe are already partially self-sufficient.
A German-Swiss research group has calculated the potential for European residential buildings to achieve grid independence with solar-plus-storage solutions. The team aimed to determine whether such homes could abandon the grid completely.
They based their calculations on a database that combined detailed geographic data about European buildings and households with local climate and economic factors. Using advanced techniques to simplify the process on high-performance computers, they designed cost-optimized, self-sustaining energy systems for 4,000 representative single-family homes. These results were then applied to the 41 million single-family homes they analyzed using neural networks.
“Under today’s conditions, 53% of the 41 million buildings are technically capable of powering themselves through the use of local rooftop PV systems alone, independent of external infrastructure, and this share could rise to 75% by 2050 due to improved technologies,” said researcher Russell McKenna. “If we now assume that building owners would be willing to invest up to 50% more than would be necessary for a comparable energy system with a grid connection, then up to two million single-family homes could leave the grid by 2050.”
Energy self-sufficient residential buildings show great potential, particularly in regions with stable weather patterns like Spain and areas with high electricity costs such as Germany. Electrolysis could also be a key component in cost-optimized systems.
“Our results show that a successful, cost-optimal and self-sufficient energy supply system for buildings in Central Europe will consist of photovoltaics for electricity generation as well as a combination of short-term battery storage and a long-term, seasonal hydrogen storage system,” said researcher Jann Weinand.
The key question is whether widespread adoption of fully self-sufficient, off-grid supply systems aligns with an efficient energy system. Single-family homes can contribute significantly to stabilizing a renewable-based energy system through load management, on-demand solar power injection, and provision of balancing services.
The research group was formed by scientists from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and the Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, as well as the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich) and the Paul Scherrer Institute.

Arizona-based Solestial said it has secured $849,954 for a second-phase Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract from NASA. Solestial will develop 50 kW solar array wings with its ultra-thin solar blanket technology.
Solestial makes ultra-thin, low-mass, radiation-hardened solar blankets for the harsh conditions and restrictive weight requirements of space-based PV. The company said its 20-micron thick cells demonstrate above 20% efficiency.
The SBIR proposal, “Next Generation Silicon Based Solar Arrays for Space Stations and Other Permanent Space Infrastructure,” adds on to a $149,987 first-phase contract from January 2023. The contracts were made possible through a new pilot program, SBIR Ignite, that funds commercially viable technologies from US startups to support research, development, and economic growth.
The 18-month second-phase contract will support the collaborative development of spacecraft solar wings along with Opterus Research and Development. The contract includes plans for the development of an array and space-based testing.
“The private space stations and lunar bases of tomorrow will require a tremendous amount of power, and currently, there are no affordable and scalable space solar technologies that can accommodate this demand,” said Solestial CEO Stan Herasimenka. “Our affordable and low-mass solar blankets will help to overcome size, cost, and manufacturing limitations to power large-scale spacecraft and surface infrastructure.”
Opterus will integrate Solestial’s solar blankets with its patent pending Retractable-Rollable Mast Array (R-ROMA) deployable solar structure. The R-ROMA is a tensioned solar blanket array with double z-folding panels deployed by a single rollable composite boom. The partnership between Solestial and Opterus will marry the two technologies to overcome the size, cost, and mass limitations of existing solar array technologies.
Solestial stated intent to achieve 50 kW scale and 200 W per kg array-level specific power while reducing costs.
The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) independently validated the ability of Solestial’s ultrathin silicon solar cells to effectively anneal radiation damage under sunlight at 90 C. This means the cells essentially self-heal under radiation damage.
Solestial’s silicon solar cells open circuit voltage dropped by only 4% and maintained 96% of initial value after being exposed to radiation equivalent to 10 years in low Earth orbit.
The company has been developing its technology for over a decade, beginning its life in Arizona State University. It underwent a $10 million seed funding round in October 2022. The most recent SBIR Ignite contract marks the ninth such award received by the company, bringing total funding from NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the U.S. Air Force to nearly $4 million to date.
Solestial targets a 2025 launch of a manufacturing facility capable of producing 10 MW per year of solar blankets. Read more about pv magazine USA coverage of solar applications in space.

Costa said the role of the prime minister was incongruous with suspicion of its involvement in a criminal act.
The resignation came hours after the public learned that police officers had searched Costa’s office as part of an investigation into alleged corruption involving hydrogen and lithium projects. Police also searched the homes of the Minister of Climate Action, Duarte Cordeiro, and Minister of Infrastructure, João Pedro Matos Fernándey.
Costa asserted his innocence in the criminal case in the address.
The Prosecutor General’s Office (PGO) released a statement yesterday confirming that 145 police officers, 20 magistrates, and nine Tax and Customs Authority officials had searched 17 homes, five lawyers’ offices, and 20 non-homes as part of a criminal investigation into malfeasance, corruption, and influence peddling.
Facts about the case, according to the statement, include lithium exploration concessions awarded to Romano, Montalegre, and Borroso, Boticas, mines; and a project related to a hydrogen energy production facility in Sines.
The PGO said it had issued warrants for the arrest of the prime minister's chief of staff, Vitor Escaria, and the mayor of Sines, Nuno Mascarenhas, among others.

French startup Koolboks has developed solar refrigerators for off-grid applications.
The units are equipped with solar panels and can operate either as refrigerators or freezers. The company said the fridges can offer continuous refrigeration for up to four days, even in limited sunlight.
Koolboks has also developed an energy distribution technique to promote cold storage in the system.
“We created ice compartments in the refrigerated cabinets,” the company said in a press release. “So, during the day, when the sun is available, which is often the case in Africa, ice is made in these compartments.”
At night, the energy transferred in the form of ice helps maintain the temperature of the cabinet. The ice storage system is complemented with lithium-ion batteries integrated into the freezer.
“Using this technology, we were able to reduce the cost of owning an off-grid solar refrigerator by almost 40%,” said Koolboks, adding that the refrigerators come with two LED lighting bulbs and USB ports to charge phones.
The refrigerators are marketed by local distributors who offer them for rent via pay-as-you-go (PAYG) technology, which allows individuals and businesses to be billed per month or per week. Koolboks is currently integrated with Aganza, Paygee and Solaris.
The company recently announced a distribution agreement with French telecoms giant Orange, which will market its products, initially in the Democratic Republic of Congo and then gradually in 11 other countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central Africa, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Jordan, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Senegal, and Sierra Leone.
The PAYG payment system will be integrated into its digital platform, Orange Smart Energies.

The ministry said that the capacity potential of such fences across dozens of kibbutz amounts to 300 MW.
The regulation is being implemented against the backdrop of the Hamas-Israel war to encourage local authorities to renovate old fences or introduce new ones. Enabling villages to profit from the fences will encourage local authorities to invest in protecting their residents, the administration said.
The regulation is now open for comment from the public and regional planning councils before it can go into effect. According to the plan, the PV modules will be installed on perimeter fences of up to 3.5 meters in height, and will not be allowed to exceed the height of the fences by more than 1 meter.
Every PV fence will be subjected to the approval of the Israeli police or the Israeli Defense Ministry.
“This move will introduce more green energy to Israel and more defense to the villages,” said the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure.

This CsPbI3 is being tested in PV devices as it promises to offer superior moisture and illumination stability. This perovskite material has an energy bandgap of approximately 1.7 eV and, according to several scientists, is an ideal solution for single-junction and wide-band-gap sub-cells in tandem PV devices.
“We developed a new approach for CsPbI3 solar cells that opens new opportunities for constructing all-inorganic perovskite solar modules,” the research's lead author, Jin-Song Hu, told pv magazine.
The scientists utilized a hydrogen-bonding-facilitated strategy to extract dimethylammonium (DMA) from the black perovskite absorber, which may result in local heterogeneity, defect formation, and rough morphology – all factors that could be detrimental to the cell efficiency and stability.
The strategy consists of bonding DMA with polyacrylic acid (PAA) during the formation of the CsPbI3 film, a process that would favor DMA extraction via the newly formed hydrogen bonds.
“The PAA-added sample exhibited relatively faster phase transformation and achieved the high-quality CsPbI3 film with no DMA residue,” the scientists said. “Systematic experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the hydrogen bonding facilitated the DMA extraction by lowering its escaping energy barrier.”
The group built the cell with a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), a titanium dioxide (TiO2) electron transfer layer (ETL), the CsPbI3 absorber, a hole transport layer (HTL) relying on a regioregular poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) polymer, and a gold (AU) metal contact.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, this device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 20.25%, which the scientists said is the highest efficiency reported on CsPbI3 PSCs with a dopant-free P3HT HTL.
“The device demonstrated superior moisture and operational stability in terms of maintaining 94% of their initial efficiency after aging at low relative humidity (RH) conditions for 10,224 h and over 93% efficiency after continuous illumination for 570 h,” they explained.
They described the novel cell technology and the related manufacturing process in the study “Hydrogen-bonding-facilitated dimethylammonium extraction for stable and efficient CsPbI3 solar cells with environmentally benign processing,” published in Joule.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/08/infinitypv-presents-measurement-system-for-roll-to-roll-thin-film-pv-manufacturing/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,DENMARK",VALERIE THOMPSON,"NOVEMBER 8, 2023",InfinityPV presents measurement system for roll-to-roll thin film PV manufacturing,"Denmark's InfinityPV, has unveiled a new light (or laser) beam induced current (LBIC) system, dubbed Antikythera, which is able to rapidly scan thin film solar foil to detect defects as foils wind off and onto roll-to-roll (R2R) spindles.
The new system relies on laser technology that supports pixel sizes from 100 µm to 40 µm, with a processing speed of up 90 µm/min. The foil length is “unlimited”, with foil widths of 350 to 2100 mm being supported, and standard widths of 350 mm, 700 mm, 1050 mm.
“One challenge for printed solar foil is that when endless rolls of solar cells are made the manufacturer does not immediately know whether or not the solar cells embedded on the roll are working,” the company's CEO, Frederik C. Krebs, told pv magazine, noting that the system’s software automatically locates the solar cells, identifies, and quantifies defects. “With our non-destructive system, the user can stop work on defective, faulty, or below spec devices, conserving resources and avoiding wasted material.”
The Antikythera system can be installed with other InfinityPV products, such as its laboratory roll to roll coater system (LR2RC), or its slot-die coating component. It can also be retrofitted into an existing line. It requires a 110-240 VAC line voltage source and can be installed above or below the moving web, according to the company.
The equipment’s footprint is dependent on the foil size. “A general rule is that the installation volume is around 1.5 times the foil width cubed,” said Krebs.
The Danish company has an existing LBIC product for analysis of sheet-based thin film PV, and customers for the R2R-based systems.
“Currently two such systems are in operation in the world. We anticipate that as the printed solar industry grows this will become paramount for the success of this industry including perovskite, organic, kesterite, CIGS and amorphous silicon,” said Krebs.
The equipment provider sells the R2R systems not only to PV manufacturers but also to manufacturers of other thin film products in the battery, fuel cell and medical device industries.
The product development  was supported by European Commission through the Clean4yield project headed by TNO (Project No.: 281027) and the RealNano project headed by Aristotelio Panepistimio Thessalonikis (Project No.: 862442).

Perth-based company Province Resources, which announced its 8 GW HyEnergy project in 2021, said this week that it has now secured enough licences to support initial development. The project is still in the feasibility phase, but the company wants to produce 550,000 tons of green hydrogen per annum, with the first stage of the HyEnergy project to include 4 GW to 5 GW of solar and wind for its electrolyzers.
Province Resources (ASX: PRL) said in a stock exchange filing this week that the area earmarked for its HyEnergy development has been “further defined,” with the Western Australian government providing additional licences to support studies on land and water. The licenses include more than 864 hectares of the seabed near Carnarvon, allowing the company to completed detailed feasibility studies into building a port for green hydrogen export.
The company is actually exploring two different export options at the moment. The first is a traditional loading jetty port. The company's proposed port would be located about 20 km north of Carnarvon, adjacent to an area known locally as the Town Common, it said. The second option is an undersea pipeline that would allow for offshore ship loading via a floating buoy. It has partnered with fellow Western Australian company Provaris to explore this option.
The new license, the company said, is for an initial two-year term and provides for ongoing technical and environmental marine studies and investigations to be completed, presumably helping the company to identify its preferred export route.

GUVNL has announced plans to procure 1 GW of solar projects. They will be awarded through competitive bidding. GUVNL will sign 25-year power purchase agreements (PPA) with the successful bidders.
It will provide a greenshoe option of up to 500 MW to successful bidders willing to execute PPAs at the lowest tariff in the competitive bidding process. The minimum quantum of power offered by the bidder should be 50 MW.
The successful bidders will set up PV projects on a build-own-operate basis. The projects can be located anywhere in India.
The developers can opt for connectivity at the state transmission utility (STU) or central transmission utility (CTU) substation for projects set up in Gujarat.
“Projects under construction, projects which are not yet commissioned and projects already commissioned but do not have any long term PPA with any agency and selling power on short-term or merchant plant basis will, however, be considered, in case these projects are not already accepted under any other Central or State Schemes and do not have any obligations towards existing buyers,” said the tender document.
Bidding closes on Dec. 4.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/08/novel-algorithm-estimates-global-maximum-power-point-in-partially-shaded-pv-systems/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ASIA,INDIA",LIOR KAHANA,"NOVEMBER 8, 2023",Novel algorithm estimates global maximum power point in partially shaded PV systems,"Scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati and the Shiv Nadar University in India have developed a new algorithm for the calculation of the global maximum power point (GMPP) of a partially shaded PV array.
“This algorithm is designed to be adaptable to any scenario derived by setting certain parameters in the generalized series-parallel PV array model,” the research's corresponding author, Shashank Kumar, told pv magazine. “It's important to note, however, that it may not be directly applicable to configurations that cannot be converted into this generalized model.”
The GMPP defines the ability of an inverter to sweep the IV curve of a PV system and identify the array voltage at which the global maximum power point occurs. When a PV system is under partially shaded conditions, its output power-voltage characteristic curve generates multiple local peaks. Under these conditions, the conventional MPPT methods could fail to maximize the output power as they track the local maximum power point (MPP) instead of the global MPP (GMPP).
In the study “A novel GMPP estimation technique for series parallel connected partially shaded PV array,” published in Solar Compass, the researchers explained that an accurate estimation of the GMPP of a solar power generator under partially shaded conditions is more difficult to achieve than under uniform irradiance conditions, due to the presence of multiple peaks or local maximum power points (LMPPs) in the power-voltage curve.
The proposed method utilizes PV module parameters such as connecting wires and diodes, as well as irradiance and temperature as input data.
It also uses a series of equations to find and sort all of the relevant zero points of the PV array. “It could be said that zero-points approximate the points where the 𝑃 − 𝑉 or 𝐼 − 𝑉 curve of the array changes its shape due to partial shading condition,” the academics explained.
The novel approach also offers a mathematical expression for the iteration voltage based on a generally observed property of LMPPs.
To test the new technique, the researchers ran 2,000 randomly generated partially shaded cases over their generalized model. Half of the cases looked at a 3 x 2 PV array using 252 W modules, with the other half referring to a 4 × 2 PV array with the same modules.
“In 3×2 PV array irradiances of all 6 modules are generated randomly in the range of 100–1100 𝑊 ∕ 𝑚 2 for every single case of 1,000 cases. All the diodes and modules in 3 ×2 PV array are at the temperature of 25 C,” the scientists added. “All the parameters of diodes and temperatures of 4×2 PV array are different, however, irradiances of 8 modules are randomly generated in the range of 100–1100 𝑊 ∕ 𝑚 2 for every case of 1000 cases.”

The researchers found that, in all of the 2,000 simulated cases, the maximum errors and the root mean square (RMS) errors were less than 1%. For the 3 × 2 PV system, the average computational time for each case was 0.3398 seconds. For the 4 × 2 arrays, that time was 1.23 seconds.
To validate their results, the scientists also built an experimental setup and compared their observations from it with the algorithm fed with the same data. “It is seen that the error in the GMPP power obtained using the proposed method is 2.5706% with respect to the GMPP obtained experimentally, which is well within the limit,” they concluded.
“Future enhancements are in the pipeline for the GMPP estimation method. My aim is to develop a more compact formula for GMPP specifically tailored for this generalized model,” Kumar stated.
