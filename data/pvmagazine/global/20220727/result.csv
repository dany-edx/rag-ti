Small combustion engines, due to their much lower efficiencies, spew much greater volumes of pollution on a per unit scale. In fact, the division chief at the California Air Resources Board was quoted as saying, ‘We [California] expect that ozone-contributing pollutants from small off-road engines [SOREs] will exceed those same emissions from cars around the 2020 time frame’.
Recently, California passed a law banning the sale of new gas-powered leaf blowers and lawn mowers (and most new SOREs) by 2024. And while corded electric lawn mowers and other plug-in landscaping equipment have been available for decades, it’s only in the past couple of years that battery technology became affordable and commercially available.
A story by the Press Herald highlighted a zero-emissions lawn care business run by two high school brothers – ‘Solar Mow’ – doing (nearly) emissions-free work. The family that owns the units also owns a solar contracting company with 350 employees serving New England – ReVision Energy.
Here’s a video reporting on the teenagers who run the company.
The unit used by Solar Mow is the Rival, manufactured by Mean Green Mowers of Ohio. The Press Herald article notes that the teens paid back a $24,000 loan for the mower to their farther, which operates for 6-7 hours on a single charge.
Buyers of the Rival can choose from a 52” or 60” cutting deck, as well as a 14.5 kWh or 22 kWh battery. The Rival accelerates from 0 to its top speed of 11.5 mph in a blistering 1.3 seconds. Default options include a comfort suspension seat and a cup holder.
On the accessories page of the unit, they list a 200 W solar panel that doubles as a shade canopy. There are no specification details on the module, but they claim that it can add up to 20 minutes of operating time per day.
 

The charge controller between the solar panel and the mower battery is a Genasun GVB-8-WP, manufactured by Sunforge.
From California’s perspective, SOREs consist of off-road spark-ignition engines that produce less than 19 kilowatts (25 horsepower) of gross power. This class includes lawn and garden, industrial, logging, airport ground support, and commercial utility equipment, golf carts, and specialty vehicles.

By 2028, California seeks to implement its second phase of the SORE emission reduction plan, by applying standards for generators and large pressure washers.
Remaining SOREs on store shelves at the end of 2023 and going into 2024 may still be sold, and owners of older equipment are permitted to continue operating, and polluting, with their small engines.

With the previous round having commissioned 2.6 GW of solar and wind power generation capacity, Ramaphosa told the nation this week: “The amount of new generation capacity procured through bid window six for wind and solar power will be doubled from 2,600 MW to 5,200 MW.”
The sixth bid window was previously targeting 1 GW of solar and 1.6 GW of wind capacity and it was not clear whether the doubling in scale would be carried out on a pro rata basis.
The head of state also announced plans to entirely remove the requirement for distributed-generation solar and wind plants to be licensed.
South Africa in 2021 changed the threshold at which grid-connected clean energy projects would require a license, raising it from 1 MW to 100 MW.
Ramaphosa said that move “unlocked a pipeline of more than 80 confirmed private sector projects with a combined capacity of over 6,000 MW” and, as a result of that success, committed to “remove the licensing threshold for embedded generation completely.”
No date was given for the introduction of license-free clean energy development, however, and Ramaphosa stressed new installations would still have to fulfill technical requirements for grid connection and to meet environmental standards.
A request for proposals will be issued in September, the head of state said, with the aim of procuring an unspecified volume of battery storage capacity.
The president said deeply indebted national utility Eskom had recently made available enough land near its power stations in Mpumalanga province to host 1.8 GW of new clean power generation capacity and announced further emergency moves by the electric company to secure more power.
“As an immediate measure, surplus capacity will be bought from existing independent power producers,” said Ramaphosa. “These are power plants which built more capacity than was required and can now supply this excess power to Eskom. As part of addressing the shortage of megawatts, Eskom will now also purchase additional energy from existing private generators such as mines, paper mills, shopping centers and other private entities that have surplus power.”
Promises to reduce paperwork and smooth permitting procedures inevitably draw a skeptical response from industry but the head of government said: “We will … be tabling special legislation in parliament on an expedited basis to address the legal and regulatory obstacles to new generation capacity for a limited period … We will, in the meantime, waive or streamline certain regulatory requirements where it is possible to do so within existing legislation. This includes reducing the regulatory requirements for solar projects in areas of low and medium environmental sensitivity.”
A more concrete pledge related to the domestically-made component requirements which apply to solar farms procured under the latest round of the REIPPPP.
Ramaphosa said the government would take “a pragmatic approach to the local content requirements for these projects, prioritizing the need to build new capacity as quickly as possible.”
The president said Eskom is on track to separate its electricity generation and distribution businesses into separate units this year, having already hived off its transmission operations into a separate entity.
Ramaphosa also said the treasury is working on a plan to ease the troubled utility's near-ZAR 400 billion ($23.7 billion) debts.

The researchers defined a new parameter – the PV cooler lifespan effectiveness factor – which they claim makes it easier to carry out the above-mentioned performance comparison. It defines the ratio of the lifespan of the cooling system to the lifespan of the PV array.
They warned that the proposed methodology should be utilized only with standard test conditions, a temperature of 25 C, and a reference PV system without the cooling system. “The lifespan of the material depends on weather conditions which are different from one region to another,” they explained. “Hence, the value of the PV cooler lifespan effectiveness factor will be different. This could be a limitation of the proposed method.”
Their analysis showed that there is a proportional relationship between the lifespan of the cooling system and the new factor, as well as an inverse proportional correlation between the PV lifespan and the new factor. “The PV cooler is considered to be a lifespan effective, if the lifespan effectiveness factor is greater than zero and lesser than or equals to unity,” the academics stated, referring to the scale they created to measure the effectiveness factor.
They described their findings in the paper “A new method for assessing photovoltaic module cooler based on lifespan effectiveness factor,” which was recently published in Cases Studies in Thermal Engineering. “This factor may have an implication of the classification and the decision on the PV cooler types,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/27/solar-support-in-hazardous-locations/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",BLAKE MATICH,"JULY 27, 2022",Solar support in hazardous locations,"From ISSUE 06 – 2022.
Solar panels may seem a juxtaposition in the midst of oilfields and atop offshore oil rigs. But thanks to its resilience and dependability, solar has found a home in some of the world’s most remote and hazardous locations, including those devoted to the extraction of fossil fuels.
“For remote critical power applications, PV is more often than not the only solution,” says Mark Cerasuolo, a director at US-based solar controller company Morningstar. And there is no shortage of remote critical power applications. Cerasuolo puts the global network of oil and gas pipelines at 3.2 million kilometers, featuring over 65,000 extraction and operation sites (9,000 of which are offshore). “Yet the growing influence and adoption of ‘Digital Oilfield’ technologies requires power to run on nearly every mile of pipeline and at every site – from the Indian Ocean floor to the Sahara Desert.”
And yet, while diesel and gas generators require continual refuelling, regular maintenance and often replacement (all extremely expensive tasks in remote and hazardous locations like mines or unmanned offshore platforms), a PV system requires little more than sunshine. “They can run for years without being touched,” added Cerasuolo, who pointed to solar arrays still in operation on satellites that have been in orbit since the 1960s as an example. “PV’s capex is soon offset by its superior opex, and that translates into bottom-line benefits very quickly.”
The digitization of oilfields not only enables increased productivity and savings, but means operations are a whole lot safer. However, these benefits all depend on “PV being the most cost-effective means of reliably powering remote systems and delivering ‘greener oilfield’ benefits.”

Taking an offshore oil platform as an example, a PV system powers valve and motor control, sensor systems, communications, lighting and navigation systems and even bird-deterrence systems. “The last is part of life at sea,” continues Cerasuolo. “Bird droppings are corrosive and can quickly affect machinery on a platform if not managed properly.” Moreover, “offshore platforms often have helidecks for transporting personnel” which are “equipped with powerful lighting systems, and our solar controllers have the load management capabilities these lighting systems require.”
The term “hazardous” doesn’t simply refer to a location’s remoteness or environmental dangers – it’s precisely defined. In North America, Underwriters Laboratories and the Canadian Standards Association use a Class/Division/Groups method, meaning a hazardous location is defined when gases, liquids and vapors (the Class) may be present (the Division) and which include substances such as hydrogen, gasoline, propane and others (the Group). Outside North America, the International Electro-technical Commission and the European Committee for Electro-technical Standardization use a “Zone System.”
Compared to alternatives, PV systems are much better suited to HazLoc standards. Often developers custom-design PV power systems in enclosures and skids for oil and gas customers, with some specializing in explosion-proof container systems where Morningstar’s charge controllers operate for years in a small, sealed space. Cerasuolo noted the technology’s fanless design reduces the potential of harmful vapors and gases flowing over circuitry, as does encapsulating internal components. “It’s quite common for Morningstar to be the second choice in such circumstances,” says Cerasuolo. “After the first controllers installed have failed in the field.”

It is said that an army marches on its stomach, but as Brooklyn-based solar fabric and structure developer Pvilion’s Julia Fowler told pv magazine, the US Army is already marching on its solar technology. “We have fully developed a turnkey solar powered integrated structure that provides shelter, power, and climate conditioning in remote and austere environments.”
In short, Pvilion developed a solar tent, a structure as easy to put up as it is to pack away and “fully independently powered.” While technology has advanced rapidly in recent decades, the tent doesn’t seem to have evolved much beyond the classic hutchie – a stick with a sheet draped over it. But Pvilion likes to think of its tents as “the Swiss Army knife of tents, as they are designed to provide more with less.”
“Not only do they provide shelter, but they provide power, convenience, adaptability, heating and cooling, and protection from the elements… with the goal of maximizing mission-objective readiness.” Of course, those missions are not always of the combat variety. “Our structures provide solutions in many different settings and applications,” says Fowler. “To name a few, disaster response, contingency response, emergency preparedness, hurricane relief, humanitarian aid, refugee centers.”
Part of this variability is the solar tent’s position in the energy-water nexus demonstrated by “Project Arcwater”, which sees the tent’s solar energy generation used to harvest water in an agile combat deployment situation.

In March 2022, Senior Master Sgt. Brent Kenney of the 52nd Fighter Wing, Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, received the 2022 Spark Tank trophy at the Air Force Association’s Warfare Symposium for “Project Arcwater”. In Kenney’s estimation, a three-day 30-person mission that would normally cost $40,000 would, with the help of the solar tent and its powering of other tech such as the water harvester, cost under $600 while providing the same combat capability.
That 98% cost reduction is put down to using 83% less fuel, less cargo space, no longer paying for water, and all with a package that is quicker and lighter. The water harvester alone negates the need for a new pallet of water every six days, representing a $9 million saving annually across the US Air Force.
Additionally, the solar structures come with ready-to-use battery kits further reducing dependency on diesel. “The kits provide modular 4 kWh battery kits, and are typically used in multiples of six, for a total of 24 kWh of readily available power,” says Fowler.
The Indian government’s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) aims for the country to reach 40% cumulative installed electric capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energies by 2030. But as one of the most densely populated countries in the world, India will have to take advantage of its high-altitude regions to reach its ambitious solar targets.
However, Saurabh Nirgudkar, a project engineer at Evergy Engineering India who contributed to the World Bank’s “Live Wire” series on “Installing Solar Power Plants in Snowbound Areas: Lessons from Himachal Pradesh, India,” told pv magazine that there is no shortage of hazards and obstacles when it comes to snowbound and high-altitude solar projects.
The projects themselves are susceptible to high winds capable of taking the module off the racking systems and even compromising the stability of the mounting systems themselves. Moreover, the modules need to be rated up to 4,000 m altitude while also being capable of operating at extremely low temperatures and withstanding a minimum of 5,400 Pascal of pressure from wind and snowloads.
Nirgudkar pointed to a number of ways to overcome these challenges, such as the addition of back rails to mounting structures and the use of gravity weights instead of deep drilling in fragile snowbound soil strata. Moreover, due to the high UV penetration, rain and snow, cabling should be installed within the mounting structure and under the PV modules. Any exposed cabling should sport additional plastic piping.
This notion was seconded by Olivier Haldi, head of business development for Stäubli Electrical Connectors, a company which has been at the forefront of solutions for PV in hazardous locations from projects in Antarctica, to projects 2,500 meters above sea level on the Muttsee dam in Switzerland and even as high as 5,000 meters above sea level in Chile’s Atacama Desert. Haldi told pv magazine that, “Generally speaking, if your product (connector) is already at or close to the limit under ‘normal’ conditions, it’s not designed for and won’t manage harsh environments. So you need a certain margin in your product design, technology and material.”
Combiner boxes, transformers and inverters (preferably string) also require shelter under panels and extra protection in case of exposure. What is more, these often remote and precarious locations also pose a range of logistical challenges, not only for installation but also offtake. Such challenges necessitate rigorous planning and site selection criteria.
While engineers have worked out methods to overcome the challenges of high-altitude, there remains the begging question of why high-altitude regions are suitable for PV in the first place?
For anyone who has spent time at altitude the answer is straightforward. Not only do PV systems prefer cooler temperatures, but the clear open skies above the cloud line along with higher levels of irradiance ensure greater yields. Take the focus area of the World Bank study, the Spiti Valley, which “receives almost 300 days of clear sunshine annually” and considering “the land at such high altitudes is predominantly barren and slopy terrain of low value, this cuts down on land cost significantly.”
Nirgudkar believes “there is a bright future for such projects. Huge steps are already being taken in this direction with Minister of Power India and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) looking at the possibility of setting up a 10 GW renewable energy project in Leh, Ladakh, which is at an altitude of more than 3,500 m. A battery energy storage system of 12 GWh is also proposed to be installed.”
“The local community also benefits from these projects,” continued Nirgudkar. Benefits include employment opportunities and economic boosts, not to mention a chance to alleviate a dependency on expensive diesel fuel which has come as a result of “erratic electricity supply.”

The PHP 6.9 million ($124,000) system will also irrigate vegetables and high-value crops for two farmers' groups.
An aquaculture and aquaponic aspect of the system sees water for irrigation pumped to a reservoir which can produce an estimated 75 kg to 80kg of fish such as tilapia after four months.
With a farm gate price of PHP 110 per kilogram for tilapia, that would mean PHP 8,250 of extra income based on a 75 kg return and the news agency said the use of solar would remove previous pump fuel costs of PHP 19,000 per year.
The new system also produces organic liquid fertilizer from the fish waste, which is put into the irrigation water in a process known as fertigation.
The project has been installed at a 600 m2 farm at Hacienda Myrianne in the municipality of Manapla and will benefit members of the Myrianne Farmers Development Association and the Myrianne Youth Farmers Organization.

The solar facility will have an estimated annual production of 30,000 MWh and will be able to cover more than a third of the desalination plant's daily consumption. The east-west oriented plant will rely on trackers and 32,000 high-efficiency solar panels provided by an unnamed manufacturer.
“We’re happy to launch the construction of the solar plant on our desalination unit in the city of Sur, to be able to power it with the green electricity while drastically reducing its carbon footprint,” Estelle Brachlianoff, Chief Executive Officer of Veolia said.
The $173 million Sharqiyah Independent Water Project was launched in 2007 and is Oman's first desalination unit. According to Veolia, the plant produces 80,000 m3/ day of drinking water using reverse osmosis (RO) with very high energy efficiency.
According to a recent study from the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, photovoltaics is currently the most cost-competitive way to power desalination.
The study took in a prospective analysis up to 2030, finding that PV would remain the most economical option to this point. But other options should not be excluded, the authors conclude – noting that scaling up desalination projects could make high voltage transmission lines viable and that the ability of concentrated solar power (CSP) to store heat could add important flexibility.

They used spalled Ge instead of gallium arsenide (GaAs), as the former, which is commonly used in space applications, reportedly reduces several issues associated with GaAs spalling. “It offers both alignment between a preferred growth orientation and an available cleavage system,” they specified. “Ge largely spalls flatly but the fracture can result in morphological defects, including arrest lines and river lines.”
Arrest lines can have a negative impact on solar cell performance as they tend to lead to device shunting, which reduces the current flowing through the solar cell junction and reduces the voltage from the solar cell. “Arrest line impact on device performance can vary from minimal to complete shunting of the device depending on the severity of the arrest line morphology,” the group explained. “The most evident indicator of arrest line severity is the height profile across the arrest line.”
The solar cell is based on gallium, indium, and arsenide (GaInAs) grown by organometallic vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE) directly on spalled Ge substrates that undergo minimal surface processing. “By patterning 5 mm × 5 mm cells across entire 50 mm wafers, we isolate regions that are defect-free and those that exhibit different morphological defects,” the scientists said.
Using electroluminescence (EL) and dark lock-in thermography (DLIT) imaging, the academics identified three morphological spalling defect types in the Ge substrates. They associated each spalling defect type with a distinct impact on cell behavior and performance using a variety of functional and physical characterization techniques.
The solar cell was able to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 23.36% where no spalling defects were present. It also achieved an open-circuit voltage of 1.019 V, a short-circuit current density of 28.49 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 80.45%. According to the scientists, these results show that spalled germanium does not need to be returned to a pristine, polished state to achieve high-quality device performance.
They described the cell technology in the paper High-Efficiency Solar Cells Grown on Spalled Germanium for Substrate Reuse without Polishing, published in Advanced Energy Materials.
The cost of producing solar cells based on compounds of III-V element materials–named according to the groups of the periodic table that they belong to–has confined these devices to niche applications including drones and satellites, where low weight and high efficiency are more pressing concerns than costs, in relation to the energy produced.

The Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office announced it selected the University of Arizona to develop a new method for identifying defects in perovskite solar cell development during the manufacturing process.
Perovskites are actively being researched worldwide for their ability to be manufactured at scale as readily printable materials that can be deposited as paper-thin solar cells. The flexible, lightweight cells are hailed for their numerous uses, like on low-load roofs, in aviation, wearables, and rapid delivery and rollout in disaster situations. Perovskites are naturally occurring minerals, but they also represent lab-made crystalline structured materials that imitate the natural minerals’ shape.
Perovskites have made leaps and bounds in their efficiency, growing from 3% in 2009 to over 25% today. However, the material currently struggles with stability, in part because temperature sensitivity causes them to degrade relatively rapidly. The earliest perovskites worked for only a few minutes or hours, but today they have a lifespan of several months. Improving this lifecycle is the focus of the grant-funded research at the University of Arizona, which is led by associate professor of chemical and environmental engineering Erin Ratcliff.
“Perovskites are the highest-performing printable solar cell technology,” said Ratcliff. “But the operating hypothesis in the field is that defects are contributing to instability.” Ratcliff is developing a method to detect the creation of defects not after the perovskites are made, which is the traditional operation, but rather during the manufacturing process. “What our project is about is trying to develop an in-line characterization tool to get you a quality control assessment to tell you how good the layers are in the exact moments you’re making them,” said Ratcliff. “This quality control method is also an indication for the long-term stability of the materials you’re making.”
Ratcliff is developing an electrochemical method to achieve this goal. The method can offer a more nuanced look at the potential presence of defects. It will involve using a robotic arm to apply a thin material about the thickness of plastic kitchen wrap to the solar panel being manufactured. “You stick it on there and you apply an electric field on [the manufacturing] line, and you can figure out how it works under operation, without having to make the whole device first,” she said.
The research is supported by the Department of Energy, the Office of Naval Research, and Tech Launch Arizona, the University of Arizona’s office that commercializes research projects. “Large-scale manufacturing of these robust, high-quality perovskite-based photovoltaics will require low-cost and practical quality control methods that can be integrated into an operating line,” said Laura Silva, senior licensing manager for the College of Science at Tech Launch Arizona. “Ratcliff’s approach is overcoming these challenges and making the technology much more attractive in a marketplace that’s demanding higher and higher performance.”

Spanish inventor José Antonio G. I.  has developed a system that is able to generate and store hydrogen on-site from tap water without electrolysis.
“Until now, the most common way to produce hydrogen is by electrolysis. However, this process implies a significant electrical consumption that makes it not interesting from an economic point of view,” he told pv magazine.
The prototype consists of a water tank that is initially filled with water, ferrosilicon, and sodium hydroxide. Hydrogen production begins when a 20 W compressor discharges pressurized air in the lower part of the tank.
“It is the air that causes the reaction between the different chemical components and generates hydrogen,” the scientist explained. “Then, the generated hydrogen leaves through the upper area of the tank to be introduced into an equally pressurized tank. The water in this second tank collects the possible impurities and hydrogen comes out through the upper part of the tank.”
After the hydrogen is purified, it flows via an upper conduit to another tank equipped with closed contacts, a safety valve and an outlet pipe assisted by a solenoid valve.

 
View of the invention, which has been granted a utility model certificate by the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office.
Among the advantages of the device: the hydrogen is produced at the place of consumption, so there is no need for transport. “It can be tailor-made to generate the consumption of a transport truck, or whatever is needed”, the author says. “Currently, we are developing a model with a 220-liter tank that can work with a pressure of 1 kg/cm2 and a flow rate of 30 liters per minute,” González Ibáñez went on to say. “This can generate heating, hot water and electricity for a household or a small business.”
The group is also designing a larger model that can work with a pressure of 750 Kg/cm2 and can reportedly supply a thermal power plant or a container ship.

After two years of extensive trials, Neoen’s Hornsdale Power Reserve now has the capacity to provide an estimated 2,000 megawatt seconds (MWs) of equivalent inertia to South Australia’s grid through Tesla’s Virtual Machine Mode technology.
Known as virtual synchronous machines or grid forming inverters, this technology gives batteries the capacity to help stabilize the grid by providing inertia. Along with frequency control services, inertia is necessary for operating a stable grid and is especially important after major disturbances. Until now, inertia services have only been provided by gas or coal-fired generators and their rapid retirement is causing inertia shortfalls or grid instability – especially in regions like South Australia, where renewable penetration has reached 64% over the last 12 months.
The Hornsdale Power Reserve will now be capable of providing around 15% of the state’s predicted inertia shortfall – a globally significant milestone. The use of the technology at Hornsdale has been approved by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), which has been working closely with Neoen, Tesla and ElectraNet, South Australia’s network operator, to trial the Virtual Machine Mode at Hornsdale following its expansion in 2020.
The companies now completed all the necessary studies, testing and analysis to deploy the technology at scale, with that capacity available from today. “We are proving that our assets can replace fossil fuels not only in the production and storage of electricity, but also through providing all the essential services that a power system needs to function,” Neoen’s Chairman and CEO Xavier Barbaro said. “We are keen to build on this progress, continuing to innovate and to accelerate the transition to renewables in Australia and around the world.”
Grid-scale big batteries in Australia find themselves in a funny position today where the technology is capable of providing multiple grid services, including fast frequency response, frequency regulation and energy arbitrage, and now – with advanced inverters – inertia. The issue is there are no markets yet to reward this full value stack.
 
This is slowing the rollout of the much needed services because their value isn’t reflected in solid revenue streams which would drive investment. Just yesterday though, the Commonwealth government-backed ARENA provided funds for Monash University to conduct a AUD 1.18 million ($818,448) study into alternative market designs to better support energy storage technologies and drive clearer investment signals. “Improving the economics of energy storage is going to be key in our transition to high shares of renewable electricity,” ARENA’s Miller added. Last year, AEMO published a white paper outlining the importance of grid-forming inverters/virtual synchronous machines in realizing its goal to be ready for instances of 100% renewables by 2025.
There are a number of other big batteries in planning or construction which will also deploy virtual synchronous capacities, including AGL’s 250 MW/250 MWh battery project on Torrens Island in South Australia.
In the lead up to the deployment, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) provided  AUD 8 million to trial the grid forming technology at Hornsdale, which sat alongside $15 million from the South Australian government’s Grid Scale Storage Fund.
ARENA’s CEO, Darren Miller, described Hornsdale as a “pioneering project” demonstrating “the full technical capabilities of what batteries can achieve with advanced inverter technology installed.”
Hornsdale is one of Australia’s largest lithium-ion batteries, second only to Neoen’s Victorian Big Battery which came online last year.
 
Neoen is also developing several other big batteries in Australia, including the 100 MW Capital battery outside Canberra and a 300MW and 800MWh battery in Blyth, north of Adelaide.
In total, the company has 576 MW of storage capacity either in operation or under construction. Neoen has previously said it plans to have at least one large-scale battery operating in each of the five states participating in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM).
At the end of 2021, Neoen’s global pool of storage assets sat at over 700 MW, the vast majority of which are in Australia.

“Universal Solar is taking orders now, with delivery expected in the fourth quarter 2022,” the company said in a statement released. “The company has signed Master Service Agreements for more than 400 MW of modules, and is negotiating an additional 175 MW, which would account for nearly all of the factory's 600 MW first-line capacity.”
The factory has a surface of around 18,500 m2 and will rely on production equipment that Universal Solar is currently purchasing from undisclosed industry-leading original equipment manufacturers.
The company will initially produce monocrystalline PERC panels with a power output ranging from 350 to 545 W and a power conversion efficiency between 20.04% and 21.46%. “Universal Solar will offer 25- to 30-year linear power output warranties and 12- to 15-year material and workmanship warranties,” the manufacturer further explained. “Universal Solar's modules will be 100 percent compliant with the U.S. Commerce Department's Withhold and Release Order on Hoshine silicon.”
The factory will mainly serve the US market. “The U.S. has a long-standing Free Trade Agreement with Panama, and Panama is an example of “near-shoring” in which U.S. businesses locate operations in countries close to home,” the company stated.

In the United States, and particularly in Texas, where grid infrastructure is becoming increasingly unreliable, Americans are struggling to beat the heat as peak temperatures lead to peak energy demand and scheduled rolling blackouts on the energy grid. Simultaneously, energy prices are increasing, especially during peak demand hours, making this summer a costly and uncomfortable situation for many.
Electriq Power, the provider of the home battery PowerPod 2, said its battery can both provide backup power during blackouts, but also provide smart time-of-use charging and discharging cycles that insulate homeowners from expensive peak demand charges. Home storage also alleviates pressure on the grid, making it more reliable and prices more stable for the surrounding community.
The lithium ferro-phosphate PowerPod 2 battery comes in a few different formats, each with a continuous 7.6 kW AC power output and an instant 9.12 kW output. The battery has 10, 15, and 20 kWh usable capacity configurations. It can shift between backup power, time of use, and self-supply operating modes, and it has a max DC efficiency of 97.6%.
Batteries are often placed in the garage or in a cool, dark place on the exterior of the home. The PowerPod 2 is rated for outdoor use with a NEMA 3R certification. It is also UL9540 and UL9540A certified. It can operate between –15 C to 55 C and at a maximum altitude of nearly 3,000 meters. The battery unit measures 27.5 cm x 50 cm x 9 cm while the accompanying inverter is sized at 18 cm x 33.7 cm x 7 cm. Both components are warrantied for 10 years by Electriq Power.
Powering Puerto Rico
Last month, Electriq Power announced it was chosen as the exclusive hardware and software supplier for Barrio Eléctrico, an organization that works with community partners to install solar and storage systems in Puerto Rico. The island suffers frequent power outages and heavy storms that affect the centralized grid, so the distributed solar and storage offer an alternative to keep the lights on.
Rooftop solar and a home battery can also reduce electricity costs, which is a major concern in Puerto Rico. Over 750,000 households on the island are considered low- or moderate income, but electricity rates on the island are among the highest for US residents. By reducing the need for energy generated from the grid, home batteries installed as part of this program can substantially lower a family’s utility bill, said Electriq power.
“Puerto Rico’s ongoing struggle with stable electricity makes the island an ideal location for home storage and solar,” said Frank Magnotti, CEO of Electriq Power. “Thanks to Barrio Eléctrico, there are greater opportunities for homes on the island to embrace independent electricity generation.”
“The talent and natural resources in Puerto Rico are the ingredients for a robust economy, but the unreliable electricity is a primary factor holding back economic development. The first step to solving the electricity crisis is grass-roots action in each community. Our program supports individuals in taking control of their electricity needs, while it simultaneously builds the community’s capacity to design and have a voice in the electric service of tomorrow. Because of allies like Electriq Power, which provides the fundamental components of our high quality, affordable systems, we have been able to initiate community and municipal actions towards a brighter, more equitable future.” Lauren Rosenblatt, founder and acting CEO of Barrio Eléctrico
The need for distributed energy resources and backup power resonates in the continental US, too. Grid reliability reports warned of summertime outages in the Midwest, California and Texas, especially as a widespread drought in the west limits hydropower production and a mismatch between supply and peak demand persists.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/27/dubai-mega-solar-project-to-be-finished-in-2027-and-could-be-scaled-back/,"FINANCE,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED ARAB EMIRATES",MAX HALL,"JULY 27, 2022",Dubai mega solar project to be finished in 2027 and could be scaled back,"A budget update issued by the utility developing the mammoth solar park taking shape in Dubai has brought forward the completion date by three years and hints heavily at a scaling back of its generation capacity.
The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park reached 1,627 MW of generation capacity in July and is supposed to have a total 5 GW by 2030.
However, a budget update issued by the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (Dewa) last week indicated the utility has set aside only around AED 12 billion ($3.27 billion) “to complete the independent power producer (IPP) projects in the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park” – plus two other infrastructure sites – “in the next five years.”
If accurate, that would mean completion of the vast solar field midway through 2027.
The cost estimates would also indicate 5 GW of photovoltaic and concentrating solar power (CSP) generation capacity would be unlikely by that stage.
Dewa has previously indicated a total budget of AED 50 billion for the huge project. pv magazine has tracked announced expenditure of AED 22.7 billion for phases two to five of the project, the last two of which are still under construction.
While there would have been additional investment for the modest, 13 MW first phase of the solar park completed in 2013, a final bill of AED 50 billion would mean around AED 27.3 billion still being anticipated, less the first-phase costs. The fact Dewa will split AED 12 billion between the solar field and two other projects – to complete all three – would imply a scaling back of ambition.
The fourth and fifth phases of the Dubai field were in July said to anticipate a further 1,233 MW of solar and CSP capacity, including a solar tower and parabolic trough which have been the subject of delays.
