Australia has found itself in a rather awkward position, as it needs more renewable generation but simultaneously restricts the amount of renewable generation in large swaths of the national grid. Compounding this is the fact some camps are arguing that new transmission is the only way out of this situation, but Australia’s framework for assessing transmission projects has been deemed unfit for purpose.
Curtailment of renewable projects has jumped almost 40% in the past year, Daniel Westerman, the CEO of AEMO, told a forum in Sydney on May 15.  The most impacted states are Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), though the woes extend into parts of Queensland.
“From our control room we can see that increasing amounts of solar and wind generation are being curtailed because there’s not enough transmission capacity to transport it,” Westerman said.
“From January to March, the links from Victoria to NSW and Tasmania were at their limits for 42% and 57% of the time respectively. And during those hours when the sun is producing free electrons, the links were binding for two-thirds of the time to NSW, and over 80% of the time to Tasmania,” he said. “In other words, parts of our energy highway are at gridlock.”
Ian Learmonth, the CEO of Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corp. (CEFC), said Australia is well below where it needs to be to reach its climate targets – that is, 43% emissions reduction and more than 80% renewable generation in the national grid by 2030.
The latest issue of pv magazine celebrates China’s journey from solar new entrant to the installation of more than 100 GW(AC) of panels this year – Vincent Shaw and Frank Haugwitz consider a remarkable 20-year journey. We take a look at what Indonesia needs to achieve its net-zero ambition and also explore the stirrings of a solar renaissance in Europe, via buzzing trade shows and gigafatory planning.
“In order to meet these very ambitious goals around renewable energy and emissions, we need to install an estimated 29 GW of large-scale renewables,” Learmonth said. “That’s about 3.6 GW a year or 300 megawatts a month. That’s a substantial wind farm a month.”

The process to tender 180 MW of PV capacity spread across 12 projects started several years ago, and initially attracted 42 applications.
In 2019, the ministry published a shortlist of 28 applicants. Last year, the government issued licenses to 11 successful projects, spread across four main regions: Bekaa (including the provinces of Bekaa and Baalbek-Hermel), Mount Lebanon, South (the provinces of South Lebanon and Nabatiyeh), and North (including North Lebanon and Akkar).
The tender design allowed the government to negotiate different tariffs for each of the four tender regions. For Bekaa specifically, which is the sunniest of the four regions, one investor bid $0.057/kWh, so all three 15 MW farms had to accept that tariff. Projects in the other three regions will receive a tariff of $0.0627/kWh, valid for 25 years from their commercial operation dates.
These prices have been known since 2021, “but may be changed down the road,” Gabriel De Lastours, the regional head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), told pv magazine.
The lengthy tender process is mainly attributed to Lebanon's severe and persistent financial and political crisis, raising doubts about the bankability of the 11 recently signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) and the ability of investors to achieve financial closure.
“The availability of international debt financing will depend on the implementation of structural reforms,” commented De Lastours, adding that “we [the EBRD] believe that the sovereign risk will remain a challenge.”
De Lastours mentioned that the bank is collaborating with the government and stakeholders from all sectors to create an innovative framework that tackles the heightened sovereign risk associated with the power purchase agreements (PPAs). Despite this, he emphasized that the recent signing of the 11 PPAs is a significant achievement, as it builds upon successful regional examples and the extensive efforts of the Ministry of Energy, supported by international experts and financial institutions like the EBRD, during the 2017-2020 period for wind projects.
Building upon the 20-year PPAs signed in 2018 for three wind farms in Akkar with a combined capacity of 226 MW, De Lastours expressed the EBRD's commitment to collaborating with the Lebanese government in enhancing the bankability of the PPAs.
Lebanon aims to source 30% of its electricity and heat from renewable sources by 2030, and the recent signing of the 11 solar PPAs marks the country's initial foray into utility-scale solar development.

“We propose an open-source community-backed flexible energy system model able to represent any arbitrarily large region of the world power system in high spatial and temporal resolution that leverages other existing open-source projects to serve industry, policymakers, and researchers,” the scientists said.
The PyPSA-Earth model can automatically download open data, create model-ready data, and integrate optimization features to address large-scale energy system planning. Utilizing the Snakemake automated workflow management system, it effectively decomposes complex software processes into subtasks and seamlessly integrates various data sources and open-source tools to process raw data. This enables the generation of national, regional, continental, or global data.
The model can provide energy system transition studies, power system studies, technology evaluation studies, technology phase-out plans, supply diversification studies, and electricity market simulations. It uses Atlite free software, which converts weather data into energy systems data, to model renewable energies such as solar, wind and hydropower.
The researchers validated the model for the African continent and Nigeria, in particular, for a 2060 net-zero energy planning study.
“Given the limitation of reliable datasets for power plants for the African region, the existing powerplantmatching tool has been extended to include additional datasets, such as OpenStreetMap, to fine-tune the African model and validate the results with the final goal of maximizing accuracy and quality of the result,” they specified. “Validating the African power grid is challenging. Different from Europe, where ENTSO-E provides reliable open data with continental scope, such a transparent data source is lacking in Africa, and only a few utilities release open data.”
The validation process confirmed that the new tool can generate power network and installed generation data that align with reliable national data, showcasing satisfactory accuracy. Notably, this model not only delivers realistic outcomes but also offers higher spatial detail.
The research group emphasized that many similar tools mentioned in previous literature have been discontinued or lack updates. In contrast, their objective is to ensure the continuous maintenance of the model, preventing it from becoming outdated. They also invited interested scholars to collaborate with the model initiative team, highlighting the potential for further enhancements and contributions.
The scientists presented the model in “PyPSA-Earth. A new global open energy system optimization model demonstrated in Africa,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.
The proposed model is part of the PyPSA meets Earth initiative, which is a research project aimed at improving energy system planning with open solutions.

The intermittency of renewable energy created the use of distributed energy tools such as energy storage and virtual power plants. But with new technologies at the grid and consumer level, utilities and regional transmission operators have turned to grid controls and maintenance software to orchestrate, aggregate and monitor the dispatch of clean power when the sun stops shining and the wind stops blowing.
Bidgely, a California-based energy data software start-up company, has released the 8760 Energy Model, a data set and report that provides utilities and industry stakeholders with behind-the-meter energy data tracked at the hourly level throughout the year. The data tool provides a new approach to grid planning, EV charging analytics, non-wire alternatives and load forecasting that aggregates the data across a full year, 24 hours per day.
With insight on how the daily load curve of each utility customer contributes to the grid, utilities have the ability to identify trends, predict future grid patterns, encourage grid-stabilizing customer behaviors and understand the load impact on grid assets, such as distribution transformers, feeders and substations, the company says.

“Energy consumption is constantly changing. As a result, utilities must develop agile responses to evolving pressures on the grid,” said Abhay Gupta, chief executive officer of Bidgely. “Our 8760 insights let utilities see their grids in high definition across time. They can use this insight to develop new rates, products, services and infrastructure investments that deliver greater value on both sides of the meter.”

“The cell we designed is suitable for commercial production, however, this requires intensive experimental work,” researcher Azhar Ali Haidry told pv magazine.
The researchers used the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium, to simulate several cell designs with different electron transport layers (ETLs) and hole transport layers (HTLs).
Through a series of simulations, the Chinese team found that the best possible cell configuration was provided by a device based on a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), a titanium oxide (TiO2) ETL, the CsSnI3 absorber, an HTL based on nickel(II) oxide (NiOx), and back electrodes.
“The perovskite CsSnI3 thickness of 1,250 nm is found optimum for obtaining the highest performance with each ETL and HTL thickness of about 50 nm,” the academics said. “The absorber layer with around 1200−1300 nm thickness, TiO2, and NiO with 50 nm thicknesses are considered favorable to obtain high PV efficiency.”
The best-performing device built with this architecture achieved an efficiency of 31.09%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.084 V, a short-circuit current of 31.17 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 88.68%. The researchers said the performance depended mainly on the absorber thickness, the perovskite material's energy bandgap, the acceptor level density, and the cell's central trap energy levels.
They described the cell in “Device Simulation of a Thin-Layer CsSnI3-Based Solar Cell with Enhanced 31.09% Efficiency,” which was recently published in Energy Fuels.
“The findings will provide the guideline for the fabrication of the CsSnI3-based PV device in the laboratory,” the scientists said.

State-run power producer NTPC will conduct a feasibility study for a 130 MW floating solar power plant in Gomati district, Tripura.
As of April 30, 2023, Tripura's installed solar power capacity stood at 17.93 MW, comprising ground-mount (5 MW), rooftop (4.78 MW), and off-grid installations (8.15 MW).
To boost renewable energy, the Tripura state government has signed an agreement with NTPC Renewable Energy Ltd. (NTPC REL) to develop floating solar and ground-mounted renewable energy projects.
Gujarat State Electricity Corp. Ltd. (GSECL) is seeking a consultant to establish a 1.5 GW floating solar plant in Gujarat's Tapi district, with bids accepted until June 1.
The prospective consultant should have completed a feasibility study and prepared a detailed project report (DPR) for a cumulative 100 MW of floating solar projects in India within the last seven years. The location details for the 1.5 GW floating solar park will be shared with the successful bidder upon finalization of the tender by GSECL.

RVO said the allocated PV capacity is represented by 1.051 MW of commercial and industrial PV systems. Another 862 MW comes from utility-scale PV plants to be built on land or water, with only 39 MW being assigned to wind power projects. Overall, the agency has allocated 2,813 MW of capacity spread across different renewable energy technologies, as well as other technologies for CO2 capture and heating.
The Dutch government initially allocated a budget of €13 billion ($14.6 billion) for the previous year's round, but only managed to allocate €11.9 billion. CO2 capture technologies received the largest share of €6.7 billion, while solar secured only €963 million, resulting in significantly reduced resources compared to the previous round.
The RVO said the lower budget allocation for the PV technology was mainly due to the grid congestion issues that are currently affecting the Netherlands' power network.
“In those areas, a subsidy applicant usually does not receive a transmission approval from the network operator, which is a requirement for obtaining the subsidies,” the agency said. “In addition, rooftop PV projects were required to indicate the installation constructor for the first time.”
In the previous round of the program, the Dutch government selected 3,426 PV projects with a combined capacity of 3,535 MW.
The Netherlands could reach between 100 GW and 180 GW of total installed solar capacity by 2050, according to a new report by Netbeheer Nederland, the Dutch association of national-regional electricity and gas network operators.
The country reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 16.5 GW at the end of June 2022, according to the most recent statistics from CBS, the nation’s statistics agency. It said the nation installed 3,803 MW in 2021 and 3,882 MW in 2022.

The company said the reuse of the panels is intended at improving the carbon footprint of the construction site and also at testing the performance of the PV modules for future applications where power production must be ensured for a limited amount of time and not the usual 25-year timeframe.
Japan-based industrial group Hamada Co., Ltd. provided the panels for the construction site. The company is also active in the solar panel recycling business, as well as in the supply of second-life modules.
Hamada also said it is currently seeking to increase the sales of second-life panels in the Kanto, Kansai, and Kyushu regions.
“Most of the reused panels are exported overseas, but by building a market here, it will be possible to properly dispose of solar panels that have reached the end of their life in Japan,” the company said.
In May 2021, the Japanese Ministry of Environment issued a guide outlining recommendations for the appropriate reuse of PV modules. The guidelines prioritize reuse over disposal or recycling and establish contractual terms, inspection procedures, and packaging methods for buyers and sellers involved in module reuse.

Since October, TÜV Rheinland, German energy supplier GVG Rhein-Erft, and network operator Rheinische Netzgesellschaft (RNG) have been testing the impact of adding 20% of hydrogen to the gas network in Erftstadt, near Cologne, Germany.
At the end of the heating period, the partners drew up an interim balance and found that all connected gas consumption devices were running without any faults. Prior to this experiment, the German legislation allowed a hydrogen blend of up to 10%.
According to TÜV Rheinland, homeowners and businesses were able to use their devices as usual throughout the heating period. These did not have to be converted for the changed composition of gas mixture, which also had no impact on regular gas network operations.
The field test is scheduled to last until the end of December. A total of 100 households from the districts of Niederberg, Borr, and Friesheim are taking part. The districts are particularly well suited for a field test of this type, as the network, which is around 9 km long, was built in 2007.
TÜV Rheinland conducted the first-ever field test in Germany on an L-gas network, which is distinct from the H-gas network in terms of gas composition and origin. L-gas, supplied to western Germany, has a lower energy content (80-87% methane) and is more cost-effective compared to H-gas, which contains 87-99% methane and is higher in energy content and cost.
TÜV Rheinland, GVG Rhein-Erft, and RNG collaborated to introduce hydrogen into the test area in multiple stages. Initially, they mixed 10% hydrogen with natural gas, and after four weeks, they gradually increased the proportion to 15%. Since October 2022, the gas network has been operating with a 20% hydrogen admixture.
“In the run-up, we exposed all gas-consuming devices in the test area to a test gas containing 23% of hydrogen. This enabled us to ensure the suitability of each individual gas appliance in the project area,” explained project manager Mr. Michael Thys (GVG).
TÜV Rheinland plans to expand its testing to explore the technical possibilities of a hydrogen admixture of up to 30% in suitable gas networks.

Spanish company nTeaser recently launched a new online platform to help investors to buy wind and solar projects from renewable energy developers in Spain.
“The first projects for sale are already available,” the company's founder, Carmen Izquierdo, told pv magazine at the the Solar + Storage España event last week in Barcelona.
Izquierdo said transactions can be carried out and concluded without intermediaries. NTeaser claims it has already about 150 registered industry investors on the platform.
“The renewable energy sector is not very transparent and is highly fragmented. Izquierdo said. “Asset and project sales are slow, expensive and inefficient, as they require negotiating with several investors simultaneously, with different requirements from each of them. There are also too many intermediaries who charge high commissions, which considerably reduces the profitability of a project.”
The platform, which offers the possibility of registering as a developer or as an investor, is free of charge. The marketplace includes solar and wind projects in all phases of development and geographies, and includes a filter with several parameters such as project size and ground typology.
The nTeaser team also offers free assistance and support.
“As a promoter, you will receive multiple offers from interested and verified investors in a matter of days, but anonymously,” Izquierdo said. “Then, it allows you to select up to three offers to perform due diligence, initiate negotiations and sign a purchase agreement.”
NTeaser says it does not require sales commissions or exclusivity.
“We do not try to sell other services either, we only charge the buyer 1% in case of success,” Izquierdo said.
The platform currently incorporates projects in Spain and Mexico, with plans to expand to Italy and LatAm in the near future, she added.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/17/president-biden-vetoes-legislation-to-repeal-moratorium-on-solar-tariffs/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 17, 2023",President Biden vetoes legislation to repeal moratorium on solar tariffs,"From pv magazine USA
In June of 2022, when President Biden implemented a two-year tariff exemption on solar modules made in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, he did so with the intention of boosting domestic manufacturing to support a growing solar industry. Fast forward almost a year, and in a vote of 56-41 vote, the U.S. Senate resolved to repeal the two-year pause on the tariffs. Today President Biden vetoed the repeal.
A statement released by the White House said that “for too long, because of unfair trade practices and underinvestment in domestic manufacturing, the United States has been reliant on China for solar energy products.”  Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in August, numerous companies have announced plans to onshore solar manufacturing to the U.S. The
White House said the country is on track to increase domestic module capacity eight-fold by the end of President Biden’s first term. Because it takes time to ramp up capacity, the tariff ruling supports U.S. businesses and solar industry workers, “while continuing to hold our trading partners accountable.”
President  Biden stated that he does not intend to extend the tariff suspension past the conclusion of the two-year period, which would end in June 2024.
The rule implements a temporary, 24-month bridge to make sure that when these new factories are operational, we have a thriving solar installation industry ready to deploy American-made solar products to homes, businesses, and communities across the Nation. Passage of this resolution bets against American innovation. It would undermine these efforts and create deep uncertainty for American businesses and workers in the solar industry. Therefore, I am vetoing this resolution.
“President Biden’s veto has helped preserve our nation’s clean energy progress and prevented a bill from becoming law that would have eliminated 30,000 American jobs, including 4,000 solar manufacturing jobs,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “This action is a reaffirmation of the administration’s commitment to business certainty in the clean energy sector, and a signal to companies to continue creating jobs, building domestic manufacturing capacity and investing in American communities.”
Hopper noted that the short-term tariff pause creates a bridge to a domestic manufacturing future. With the U.S. experiencing “an avalanche of solar manufacturing investment,” Hopper said that the pause could not have come at a better time.
“Every metric shows that the Biden administration’s policies are working to achieve both goals, and we thank the President for taking this action and protecting the livelihoods of 255,000 solar and storage workers nationwide,” Hopper concluded.
George Hershman, chief executive officer of SOLV Energy, a utility solar contractor, concurred that repeal of the moratorium would have “created business uncertainty, placed tens of thousands of clean energy jobs at risk, and stalled solar projects across the country.” He added that the President’s veto “of this harmful resolution is a victory for U.S. solar companies and the growing solar workforce.”
Calling the veto “a welcome step to avoid a disastrous impact on the U.S. economy,” Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council of Renewable Energy (ACORE), said that the Congressional Review Act repeal passed by Congress would have resulted in “many dozens of canceled solar projects, tens of thousands of lost jobs, and a dangerous increase in carbon emissions.”
“Thanks to the President’s veto, the U.S. solar industry can now resume its growth as we expand our domestic manufacturing base to better meet the growing U.S. demand for solar panels,” said Wetstone.
