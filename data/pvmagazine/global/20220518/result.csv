In traditional solar panels, covering just 1% of the panel can cause a 33% reduction in power output, and 10% shading can cut production altogether.
San Francisco-based Optivolt saw an opportunity here to deliver a product that can turn shaded areas into sites of plentiful photovoltaic production. The company said its proprietary shade-tolerance technology, Optivolt Pulse, delivers up to 25 times more power in the shade when compared to conventional solar panels.
Pulse is a low-cost shade tolerance system that lives in the junction box and is a drop-in replacement for bypass diodes, using the same panel connections.
When the panel is fully illuminated, the shade tolerance system does nothing, and draws no power. When the panel is shaded, the optimizer goes to work, virtually averaging the dimmed spot across the panel.
The Pulse shade tolerance system is managed by Optivolt Glide, an MPPT controller with 98% efficiency. Together, the two technologies join to form its Thin Mint panel series, devices which range from small 3 W panels for powering single electronic devices to robust 410 W solar modules.
The patent-pending device is currently competing in the Department of Energy’s American-Made Challenge for hardware.
Optivolt said its product represents the next generation of solar panels. It points to the history of solar optimization, saying that the 2000s were focused on reducing macro-scale balance of system losses in large solar facilities, and the 2010s saw the rise in maximum power point tracking (MPPT), with module-level optimization being built into panels to boost production. Now, Optivolt is introducing sub-module optimization, perhaps a new phase in the advancement of solar.
“If you assume the global solar install base was shaded an average of just 1% with a 5% standard deviation, 225 terawatt-hours of energy production was untapped in 2021 due to the limits of today’s solar technology.” said Rohit Kalyanpur, founder and chief executive of Optivolt. “This represents roughly $29B in electricity generation and 11.2 billion kg of carbon emission offsets that went uncaptured. That’s just a conservative estimate, the real figure could be much higher.”
The company said it sees immediate opportunity in distributed and off-grid applications like Internet of Things (IoT) devices, 5G infrastructure, military equipment, robotics, and electric vehicles.
Optivolt was launched in 2018, and recently the company announced its largest funding victory to date, raising $8.2 million in a seed round funding led by Atlas Innovate. Other participating investors included Social Impact Capital, Pure Ventures, City Light Capital, and Peter Relan, who was an initial investor in Discord. The new round brings Optivolt’s funding to $10.1 million.
“What excites us about the technology is that it not only produces dramatic improvement for existing solar applications, but it enables the use of solar in new markets that are in dire need of ‘must-work’ critical power, such as 5G infrastructure and industrial IoT,” said Alain Rothstein, partner at Atlas Innovate.
“Our power grid is becoming increasingly unstable due to the effects of climate change, and it’s predicted that we’ll run out of oil in 41 years at current consumption. Optivolt’s shade tolerant panels deliver reliable off-grid energy to keep machines & critical infrastructure powered even through the most adverse conditions,” said Daniel Kofman, co-founder and CTO of Optivolt.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/18/2022-pv-module-reliability-scorecard-results-show-resilience-of-the-industry/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 18, 2022",2022 PV Module Reliability Scorecard results show resilience of the industry,"The 2022 PV Module Reliability Scorecard, published today by PV Evolution Labs (PVEL), names 122 models of PV modules from 25 manufacturers as Top Performers in PVEL’s testing. PVEL is the leading independent test lab for the downstream solar and energy storage industry.
Launched in 2014 and now in its 8th Edition, the Scorecard summarizes results from the PV Module Product Qualification Program (PQP), a testing regime that PVEL established in 2012 to provide empirical data for PV module benchmarking and project-level energy yield and financial models.
Tristan Erion-Lorico, PVEL Vice President of sales and marketing, told pv magazine that as the industry matures, developers, investors and insurance companies have realized that there can be a significant difference between modules that are certified and those that go through the Product Qualification Program. Customers not only in US markets but around the world are requiring a report. “It unlocks a significant portion of the market,” said Erion-Lorico.
“The 2022 PV Module Reliability Scorecard is a testament to the resilience of an industry that is relentlessly pursuing the deployment of reliable solar power – no matter what obstacles arise. We know that the world is counting on us for the transition to clean energy. At PVEL, we create the data that matters for a greener future, and we’re pleased to report that results have improved across many of our tests.” Jenya Meydbray, PVEL CEO
Last year was the first time that the report was online-only, and 20,000 individuals from more than 100 different countries downloaded the the scorecard.
“People are using our data to help them determine manufacturers and modules that they should consider for the projects,” Erion-Lorico said. “It’s beneficial to the manufacturers who are in it because they are reaching 20,000 potential customers.”
Looking back over the eight years of PQP testing, Erion-Lorico noted that one of the biggest changes seen this year is the varying sizes of the modules and the wide range of power classes of modules.
This year a record of 12 manufacturers had one or more model types that were Top Performers in every reliability test – and six of these model types were also Top Performers in energy yield (PAN) performance. Top Performers came from four different designs, different cells sizes and from the US, China, Malaysia, and Thailand. Interestingly, all PAN Top Performers were bifacial modules.

“This is a good news story. No matter what they’re producing, they’re able to achieve excellent results that go across all tests,” said Erion-Lorico, emphasizing that it’s a sign of maturity in the industry.
The results of the Thermal Cycling and Damp Heat tests are good examples of the advancements being made in the industry. This year’s Thermal Cycling results are another good news story–they are the best in PVEL’s history. About 90% of modules tested degraded by less than 2%. As Erion-Lorico pointed out, this is basically a test of solder fatigue, which they are seeing much less of that, indicating the precision that has been achieved in this step of the manufacturing process.
Damp Heat testing, however, showed a wide range of performance with only half of test modules achieving top-performing results after the full test sequence, and one module degraded by 54%, the worst Damp Heat result in PVEL history. This is a test of the module’s lamination, Erion-Lorico said, noting that in the past, when mono PERC became more widely used there was a destabilization issue where there were high amounts of power loss.
In this year’s test, PVEL saw a 67% decrease in bill of materials (BOM) requiring boron-oxygen (BO) stabilization: Only 23% of top-performing BOMs required BO stabilization to achieve <2% degradation versus 70% in 2021. They’re not seeing that same level of destabilization but now the poor results are more related to corrosion, which could be a by-product of gallium dopant or could be related to metallization of cells, according to Erion-Lorico.
“Manufacturers overcame significant challenges in the last year, and compared to previous Scorecards, the 2022 results show that module technology is improving overall,” noted Erion-Lorico. “PVEL’s Scorecard showcases impressive examples of product performance and reliability across our rigorous testing program, allowing buyers to easily identify high-quality modules.”
PVEL generally releases new tests every two years as new failure modes evolve. For example, the Light and Elevated Temperature-Induced Degradation (LETID) test was added in 2018 to test for failure of what was mostly PERC cells. PVEL also recently added the hail stress sequence because hail became a significant issue in  recent years.
“As we see more n-type modules, TopCon and heterojunction modules, we might see failure modes specific to those module types. It’s important that the tests are relevant for the products being shipped,” said Erion-Lorico.
Participation in PVEL’s PQP and Scorecard is voluntary for manufacturers and only top-performing module model types are named in the Scorecard. To date, PVEL has tested over 500 BOMs from more than 50 manufacturers for the PV Module PQP. The Scorecard is publicly accessible in an interactive digital format, with a searchable database of Top Performing modules at. A downloadable PDF summary is also available.

Greenko has started building a 5.23 GW renewables-integrated storage project in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. 
The project, which is purportedly the first of its kind, will pair energy storage with wind and solar power. It will feature 10.8 GWh of daily pumped storage, 3 GW of solar, and 550 MW of wind.
Hyderabad-based Greenko expects the $3 billion project to become operational by the end of 2023. It has already started signing storage contracts with central utilities and large industrial customers. 
The company has an installed renewables capacity of 7.5 GW, including wind, solar and hydro, with 10 GW now under development. It is also building an intelligent, low-cost energy cloud storage platform with 50 GWh of annual capacity by 2025, followed by 100 GWh to be commissioned by 2027. In addition, it is targeting 10 GW of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030.

The commission is proposing a solar rooftop requirement for commercial and public buildings from 2027, and for new residential buildings from 2029. “I know this is ambitious, but it is realistic, we can do it,” said von der Leyen, noting that investment in renewables is the bloc’s “biggest task.”
The commission also said that it is increasing its renewable energy target for 2030 from 40% to 45%. Faster permits for renewables will play a key role in achieving the higher target, she said. It also wants member states to set “renewables go-to-areas” for swift permitting. “There the permitting process is down to one year,” a substantial improvement on the current average of six to nine years, said von der Leyen.
The strategy also sets a 592 GWac (740 GWdc) target for solar in the European Union by 2030. “This target is higher than SolarPower Europe Global Market Outlook business-as-usual projections of 672 GWdc by the end of the decade,” trade body SolarPower Europe said in a statement released.
Applications for renewable energy systems in go-to areas would be entitled to decisions within 14 days, according to a leaked document that pv magazine has seen. Repowered sites in such areas would need to be permitted within six to nine months. The same would apply to systems with generation capacities of less than 150 kW. Other proposals announced include an increase of the EU energy efficiency target for 2030, from 9% to 13%.
“Today the European Commission recognises the immense potential of rooftop solar – as well as the need for a solar workforce to roll out both rooftop and utility solar across Europe,” said Dries Acke, policy director at SolarPower Europe. “We foresee up to 1.1 million solar jobs in Europe by 2030, and the EU Solar Skills Partnership will help deliver the workers on the ground.”

They have found that each of the proposed configurations could result in low capital costs and high efficiency.
The scientists quantified the impact of the PEM RFC and RSOC on overall system degradation. Their modeling considered a typical medium-sized commercial building in Los Angeles, California. Its minimum value of electricity demand was 18.79 kW during the night, with a maximum demand of 178.30 kW in August. The rooftop solar array was assumed to have a capacity of 400 kW, with 310.15 W SPR-E19-310-COM solar modules with 19% efficiency from US manufacturer SunPower.
The 250 kW RSOC system – equipped with an air preheater, water boiler, and high-performance heat exchangers – was assumed to have a power density of 0.312 W and an overall system efficiency of 43.99. The fuel cell has a capacity of 251.4 kW, a power density of 0.284 W, with a total system efficiency of 38.18%.
The cost of the RFC was estimated at around $667/kW and that of the RSOC at $500/kW. The costs were based on a modeled 250 kW PEM stack cost and 250 kW RSOC stack cost, at 10,000 units per year. The battery is based on a nickel-manganese-cobalt cathode and graphite anode, and has a storage capacity of 400 kWh. It has a round-trip efficiency of 92.5% and a cost of $339/kW. Its lifetime is more than 5,000 cycles.
The academics found that the PV system can achieve a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of $0.0237/kWh. The levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of the RFC, RSOC and the battery was $0.04173/kWh, $0.02818/kWh, and 0.02585/kWh, respectively.
“The breakdown of the LCOS shows that capital cost accounts for more than 65% of the total LCOS, making it the most important component that needs more R&D to bring the capital cost down for these energy storage technologies,” they explained.
They found that the LCOS increases and the discharge decrease depended on the lifetime of each of the three storage technologies they used.
“The LCOS is sensitive to changes in capital costs, round-trip efficiency, lifetime, and discount rate; therefore, changes in these parameters should be carefully considered,” they warned, noting that lithium-ion batteries offer the most economical solution along with maximum efficiency, while also noting that  RFCs and RSOCs can improve a standalone building's reliability and resiliency.
The scientists presented their findings in “Techno-economic analysis of energy storage systems using reversible fuel cells and rechargeable batteries in green buildings,” which was recently published in Energy.
*The article has been amended on May 24 to reflect that the total system efficiency is 38.18% and not 31.18%, as we previously reported.

The advantage of a fiber-optic solar-cell system over a planar one is that light scatters inside the optical fiber as it moves along its length, providing more opportunities to interact with the solar cell itself on its inner surface, generating more power. Fiber solar cells also require less surface area than planar cells, as the long lengths of the fibers can be embedded into the structure of buildings, like electrical wiring.
The research team adapted the structure of the organic solar cell to optimize light scattering and absorption through nano-sized holes pierced on the surface of a special optical fiber called Optical Side Lighting (OSD).
“This enabled to install the optical fiber and the solar panel in a vertical three-dimensional structure and maintain the generation efficiency for a long time regardless of the angle of the panel,” the academics said. “The power generation efficiency is greatly improved and the maximum efficiency time of the solar panel is also increased to an average of six hours or more per day.”
They used side-emitting optical fibers to operate the system in an unstable outdoor environment. “It is also possible to adopt high-efficiency panels that have not been used in the past because they are sensitive to external environments such as heat, dust, and humidity,” they explained.
Researcher Dong Chan Lim noted that the proposed system configuration could be used for high-efficiency products.
“Recently, materials for organic solar cells with 20% or more power generation efficiency are continuously being developed, but there is a concern due to the nature of organic material which would be vulnerable to heat or humidity,” said Dong.  “This technology can significantly reduce the area for solar power generation by about a fifth or more, and be used for portable solar generators, electric vehicles, and distributed power generation systems.”
Solar Optics and KIMS said they are currently seeking to commercialize the world’s first high-efficiency solar power facilities based on the OSD, but they did not provide any additional details.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/18/lg-energy-solution-unveils-new-battery-storage-solutions-moves-to-lfp/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"MAY 18, 2022","LG Energy Solution unveils new battery storage solutions, moves to LFP","Flexibility is at the heart of the latest battery storage innovations coming from South Korean battery company LG Energy Solution. As seen at the Smarter E event in Munich last week, the business has gone one step further in modularizing its RESU Flex home battery system. It has also developed a new containerized, grid-scale energy storage solution that is delivered pre-assembled.
True to its name, the modular RESU Flex residential battery storage solution can be installed in various capacities, ranging from to 8.6 kWh to 17.2 kWh, with more than 30 different installation forms to maximize space efficiency. According to customer preferences, RESU Flex can be installed on any surface, indoor or outdoor, said the manufacturer.
Depending on the configuration, RESU Flex has a voltage range of 192 V to 531.2 V and can serve different energy usage patterns. The 8.6 kWh system, which features two battery modules and a battery protection unit, is primarily designed to support self-consumption, shaving peak hour loads and back-up critical loads in emergency. The three-battery module unit with 12.9 kWh capacity can cover energy-consuming devices, such as heat pumps and EVs, as well as provide back up to critical loads in emergency. The 17.2 kWh system is well-equipped for a wide range of applications from home to small C&I, as well as a whole home backup, depending on the functionality of the inverter.
The battery module measures 665.2 mm x 665.2 mm x 148.4 mmm and weighs in at 48.9 kg. All configurations come with a separate battery protection unit which weighs at 16.6 kg. The operating temperature range goes from -10 C to 50 C. The product also features an IP55 protection level.
In addition to single-phase inverters, RESU Flex is compatible with three-phase inverters made by Kostal, Fronius, SMA and GoodWe. As Jorg Jurgens, LGES director of energy storage systems EMEA, confirmed to pv magazine, RESU Flex is readily available for shipment. If ordered today, it would be delivered in just a couple of weeks, which is much faster than the time frames offered by most battery manufacturers. Current order waiting times are around five months in Germany, for example.
The new RESU Flex series will feature the NMC battery chemistry. The South Korean manufacturer has long been faithful to NMC, but it now plans to develop and release LFP-standard cells by October 2023 and LFP long cells by the fourth quarter of 2024. The dates are still under review. Jurgens told pv magazine that the transition will be a smooth one, as the LFP cells will be produced in the same format and sizes, so the systems will be able to use the same modules and racks as before.
The new battery cells will be made in Holland in the US state of Michigan, with double-digit gigawatt-scale production lines being added to the facility, Jurgens said. This aligns with an earlier announcement from LG Energy Solution that it is pouring in $1.7 billion to increase the production capacity for battery cells and packs at the Michigan plan, up fivefold from 5 GWh at present.
Once developed, the LFP batteries will be part of the company's expanded portfolio which will still include its existing lineup of NMC batteries.
Residential recalls 
The move to the safer nickel and cobalt-free battery chemistry follows LG Energy Solution's forced recall of some of its battery energy storage systems in the United States and Australia due to potential fire-related risks. In March 2021, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) issued a recall notice for batteries in LG Energy Solution's lithium-ion RESU residential range, due to the potential risk of overheating and catching fire.
Only a couple of months later, LG Energy Solutions itself launched a free replacement program for certain models that were manufactured between April 2017 and September 2018. The replacement program, which was assessed to cost around $350 million, was announced after overheating incidents were reported.
Last August, LG Energy Solution Michigan launched a recall campaign for its RESU 10H batteries in the US market that affected about 10,000 storage systems. “The home batteries can overheat, poising a risk of fire and emission of harmful smoke,” the manufacturer said at the time. The recall was launched on the back of five reports of the lithium storage batteries smoking and catching on fire, resulting in property damage and one injury.
The first recall of its residential batteries in the United States took place only weeks after the manufacturer launched the new line of products in December 2020. It affected 1,815 RESU 10H units sold between January 2017 and March 2019. The reason behind the recall were reports of LG Chem RESU 10H fires resulting in minor property damage but no injuries.
Other innovations that LG Energy Solutions presented last week in Munich include the new container-based ESS solution is delivered fully assembled at the factory. It said this reduces the site installation time by 40% and cost by 30%. Compared to conventional 40-foot ISO systems, the modular and scalable containerized ESS solution reduces the installation area by 15%, saving costs incorporated with land. It is designed as more than a simple battery rack system, incorporating an active ventilation system, a fire suppression system and a HVAC system.
The company also showcased other high-performance, grid-based ESS products in its portfolio, including a high-voltage rack (1,400V) and the Transportable Rack 1300, a pre-engineered rack system optimized for indoor conditions.

Researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) have reported a major breakthrough in the generation of so-called “nighttime” solar power – a process previously conceived of only theoretically.  
The breakthrough saw a team from the UNSW School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering generate electricity from heat radiated as infrared light, in a mimicking of the same system by which the planet cools itself by radiating heat into space at night. By employing a semiconductor device known as a thermoradiative diode (a similar material composition is found in night-vision goggles), the team was able to generate a small amount of power from the infrared light (approximately 100,000 times less than that produced by a solar panel). 
Though seemingly minor, the research team believes the result is just the beginning.
“We have made an unambiguous demonstration of electrical power from a thermoradiative diode,” said Professor Ned Ekins-Daukes. “Using thermal imaging cameras you can see how much radiation there is at night, but just in the infrared rather than the visible wavelengths. What we have done is make a device that can generate electrical power from the emission of infrared thermal radiation.”
Ekins-Daukes said the process is still a harnessing of solar power, for the solar energy had hit the Earth during the day, warming the planet. But instead of that energy radiating back out into space in the form of infrared light, it can now be harvested. 
“Photovoltaics, the direct conversion of sunlight into electricity, is an artificial process that humans have developed in order to convert the solar energy into power,” Phoebe Pearce, one of the co-authors of the research paper published in ACS Photonics. “In that sense the thermoradiative process is similar; we are diverting energy flowing in the infrared from a warm Earth into the cold universe. In the same way that a solar cell can generate electricity by absorbing sunlight emitted from a very hot sun, the thermoradiative diode generates electricity by emitting infrared light into a colder environment. In both cases the temperature difference is what lets us generate electricity.”  
The researchers believe the breakthrough could be the beginning of a long path toward devices that could one day capture energy at a much larger scope than currently conceived. Indeed, Ekins-Daukes likened the research to that performed by engineers at Bell Labs in 1954 who demonstrated the first practical silicon solar cell. That cell was barely 2% efficient, whereas modern day cells are able to convert around 23% of received sunlight into electricity. 
Fellow co-author Michael Nielsen noted that despite how far away commercialisation of this technology is, the evolving idea is extremely exciting. 
“By leveraging our knowledge of how to design and optimise solar cells and borrowing materials from the existing mid-infrared photodetector community, we hope for rapid progress towards delivering the dream of solar power at night,” said Nielsen. 
The scope of potential application for this technology is staggering. One such idea is power from body heat, which would see bionic devices such as artificial hearts powered just from heat generated in the body. 
“Down the line, this technology could potentially harvest that energy and remove the need for batteries in certain devices – or help to recharge them,” said Ekins-Daukes. “That isn’t something where conventional solar power would necessarily be a viable option.” 
While the technology still needs a decade of research in universities, the industry should be prepared to step in and drive advancement by seeing the enormous potential of such an energy-gathering tool.

Sembcorp Energy India’s step-down subsidiary, Green Infra Wind Energy Ltd (GIWEL), has signed a long-term wind-solar hybrid energy supply agreement with Saint-Gobain India, the India unit of French construction material supplier Saint-Gobain. Sembcorp will supply 33 MW of renewable power to Saint-Gobain’s manufacturing facilities in Sriperumbudur, Perundurai, and Tiruvallur over a period of 25 years.
GIWEL will develop the renewable power plant through a special purpose vehicle (SPV). It will hold a 74% stake in the SPV, with the remainder owned by Saint-Gobain India.
Saint-Gobain is targeting carbon neutrality by 2050.
“Aimed at fulfilling the ambitious target of 100% green power by 2027-28, the agreement with Sembcorp is another step in our continued efforts to add more green capacity through collaboration with green power generators and to meet our sustainability targets,’’ said Venkat Subramanian, managing director of Saint-Gobain's Gyproc business.
To date, Saint-Gobain India has installed multiple solar plants in India. By the end of December, these captive solar plants will replace close to 22 million units of electricity required. And by 2023, Saint-Gobain India will have 44% of its electricity consumption coming from renewables.

Ambient Photonics secured $31 million in Series A financing for a solar cell production facility, led by Amazon through its Climate Pledge Fund, and Ecosystem Integrity Fund, Future Shape, and I Squared Capital also participating in the round.
Ambient Photonics develops a unique low-light energy harvesting photovoltaic (PV) technology that the company reports can generate as much as three times more power than conventional technology. Its cells are made using an industrial printing process through which proprietary energy harvesting molecules are applied to thin and durable glass substrates to create cells of virtually any size and shape.
Compared to semiconductor vacuum manufacturing methodologies, Ambient said its rapid production process is efficient, scalable and lower cost. Ambient works with global smart home and Internet of Things (IoT) device manufacturers on embedded solar cells. The technology reportedly can deliver power density from a broader spectrum of ambient light.
By powering smart home and IoT devices with embedded solar cells, batteries are not needed—thus reducing landfill waste.
“Disposable batteries are both a consumer inconvenience and a significant environmental problem,” stated Matt Peterson, director of The Climate Pledge Fund at Amazon. “We are excited that through The Climate Pledge Fund we will invest in Ambient to help in their path toward creating innovative solutions to decrease the carbon footprint of battery-operated devices across industries.”
“We believe Ambient has the potential to catalyze more sustainable systems across growing global industries, including consumer electronics, smart home and IoT.
