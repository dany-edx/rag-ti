SMA Solar Technology AG has started building a 20 GW inverter factory at its headquarters in Niestetal, in Hesse, Germany. The new manufacturing facility will be completed by the end of 2024, pushing the company's total annual capacity to 40 GW.
“Against the background of global climate change, the entire world is pinning its hopes on renewable energy,” said SMA CEO Jürgen Reinert. “But to leverage this enormous potential, photovoltaics have to be intelligently coupled with storage systems, e-mobility, and other sectors and integrated in the overall system.”
He said the German inverter manufacturer will produce system solutions for large-scale PV power plants within two years in Niestetal.
“And shipping them out across the world,” said Reinert. “In this way, we will be making a vital contribution right here in this region to a future-proof energy supply.”
Reinert recently said that SMA Solar is also considering investing in a factory in the United states, although a decision has not yet been made. However, the subsidies from the US Inflation Reduction Act currently make it attractive to open production facilities in the US market, given that SMA also has a large market share in PV plants overseas.
“Delivering these from Hesse would mean a price disadvantage of around 20%,” said Reinert.
In the future, SMA Solar mainly plans to produce systems for the large-scale plant segment.

This is the first public call in Croatia in which subsidies will come from the European Union’s Modernization Fund, which was set up in 2021 to help 10 member states to upgrade their grids and meet 2030 energy targets. The Croatian Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development said the goal is for companies to produce energy for self-consumption, which should bring down energy costs.
Companies can secure between €100,000 and €2 million per project. Developers can apply for multiple projects, with the maximum amount per single applicant capped at €4 million. The ministry said it expects the investments to deliver 80 MW of renewable energy capacity and 20 MWh of energy storage capacity.
In addition, the ministry said it is also preparing to allocate €80 million of funds for investments in energy efficiency and high-efficiency co-generation in the processing industry.
The latest announcement closely follows the European Commission’s decision to refer Croatia, Hungary, and Portugal to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for failing to turn the EU Renewable Energy Directive into national legislation by June 30, 2021. The directive, which was adopted in 2018, sets an EU-level binding target for 2030 of at least 32% renewable energy, among other measures.
However, Croatia announced its final National and Climate Plan (NECP) in October 2021. It aims at a 36.4% share for renewable energy by 2030 and investment across the energy sector, including hydropower, wind farms, solar plants, and hydrogen energy.
According to UK-based consulting firm GlobalData, Croatia is now on target to meet to meet this target, although its solar PV deployment has been tepid thus far. The country might only add 2.5 MW of new solar capacity in 2022, and another 19 MW next year, GlobalData said in December.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) says that Croatia had 309 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2021. GlobalData expects the country to reach 770 MW of cumulative solar capacity by 2030.

It aims to bypass the congestion on the national electricity grid, as storage will allow PV-generated electricity to be used during the night when demand is higher.
The agency said developers will be allowed to build additional storage facilities without increasing the existing connection to the grid and without submitting additional applications. The measure applies to distributed-generation solar plants – mostly rooftop PV projects for self-consumption purposes, with surplus electricity to be injected into the grid.
According to the decision, if a distributed PV plant produces more solar energy than the regulated rate, the producer will receive an additional payment covering the difference between the reduced rate and the regulated rate. The reduced rate is 5% for PV installations with capacities up to 300 kW and 15% for facilities up to 600 kW in size.
“The unique rate will be given during peak hours only and will be calculated and paid to the producer on an annual basis,” the Electricity Authority said in a statement.
The agency said that by offering a supplementary tariff for stored electricity that would have otherwise been fed into the congested grid, it will be able to increase the amount of solar without putting the network under additional pressure.
“The decision will make it possible to bypass the network traffic jams and increase the scope of renewable energy production by hundreds of megawatts per year,” said Amir Shavit, the chairman of the Electricity Authority.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/19/translucent-tandem-perovskite-perovskite-solar-cells-for-bipv/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 19, 2023",Translucent tandem perovskite-perovskite solar cells for BIPV,"A group of scientists led by Germany's Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) has developed a new way to fabricate micro-patterned translucent perovskite PV cells that could be used in tandem solar modules intended for applications in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).
“While translucent perovskite multi-junction devices have been envisaged and recognized as a promising path towards high- efficiency neutral-color transparent PV, the tolerance of complex perovskite tandem stacks against extensive laser scribing has yet to be explored,” the research group said.
The researchers noted that the cells have thus far provided decent levels of power conversion efficiency while maintaining a high average visible transmittance (AVT). They used a custom-built laser scribing setup to fabricate a perovskite solar cell with n–i–p architecture and with an active area of 0.105 cm 2. The device is based on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a hole transport layer made of carbazole (2PACz), an electron transport layer made of buckminsterfullerene (C60), an absorber based on methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3), a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a gold (Au) metal contact.
They scaled up the cell area by a factor of 40 to 4 cm2 to reach an AVT of 30%. They combined four of these cells into a mini module with an area of 20 mm x 4 mm.
“The monolithic series interconnections are fabricated via laser scribing of the established P1–P2–P3 lines,” they explained.
The mini panel has an efficiency of 9.0% at 32% AVT, an open-circuit voltage of 5.5 V, a short-circuit current density of 11.1 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 74%.
The group also built a two-terminal (2T) tandem perovskite-perovskite solar cell that reached a power conversion efficiency of up to 17.7% at 12% AVT. It also achieved an open-circuit voltage of 1.95 V, a short-circuit current of 11.9 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 77%.
“Following subsequent upscaling, a translucent tandem mini-module with 12.25 cm 2 aperture area, similar device architecture and fabricated via fully scalable deposition methods provides promising 10.3% efficiency at 15% AVT while further optimizations,” they said.
The group claims that the cells are the best-performing translucent perovskite tandem solar cells fabricated at the research level to date.
“The devices successfully demonstrate the good electrical performance as well as uniform optical impression of the implemented transmittance gradients, being enabled by the versatile laser scribed translucent photovoltaics,” they said.
They described the cell technology in “Translucent perovskite photovoltaics for building integration,” which was recently published in Royal Society of Chemistry.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/19/dust-removal-for-solar-panels-via-electrostatic-cleaning/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JORDAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 19, 2023",Dust removal for solar panels via electrostatic cleaning,"Researchers from the University of Jordan have proposed the use of electrostatic cleaning as an effective way to remove dust from solar panels.
Electrostatic cleaning involves the spraying of electrostatically charged mist with low-frequency high voltage onto surfaces and objects. It is commonly used for cleaning and disinfection purposes, and may involve the use of different electrically charging disinfectants, sanitizers, and cleaners.
The scientists said the glass in solar modules contains an equal number of positive and negative charges, which means it is electrically balanced. However, friction might disrupt this balance, causing the material to become electrically charged.
“The electrical charge will create an attraction force between the dust particles and the glass due to static charge causing dust accumulation over PV modules,” the researchers explained.
The academics proposed the use of an electrostatic ionizer, which uses ions to neutralize static electricity, in order to reduce the attraction between dust particles. They used an ionizer manufactured by UK specialist Exair, which could flood the PV module surface with uniform airflow across its length, loaded with static eliminator ions. The ionizer was placed on a shaft 0.2 m the shaft attached to a screw driven by an AC gear motor above the panel.
“The charged surface attracts the appropriate number of positive and negative ions to become neutral,” the researchers explained, noting that this process is able to charge the molecules of the gasses of the surrounding air, which in turn results in a shower of ions. “Stainless steel emitter points inside the Ion Bar receive 5 kVrms high voltage, via an armored and electromagnetic shielded high voltage cable. An integrated ground wire within the power cable creates a discharge path from the emitter to the bar channel.”
The Jordanian group tested the cleaning technique on a set of four 250 W polycrystalline solar modules mounted with a tilt angle of 25 degrees at the renewable energy center of Applied Science Private University in Amman. The performance was compared to that of natural cleaning and cleaning based on anti-reflective coating.
After two weeks of testing, the scientists found that the PV modules had an energy yield loss of around 5.93% with natural cleaning. They said that the coating was also about 3.8 times more economically feasible than electrostatic neutralization under the stated conditions in the study.
“However, the vanishing of the coating material after two weeks arising a recoating issue from an economic perspective compared with electrostatic neutralization where the running cost could be eliminated via developing a fixed mechanism with no moving parts,” the scientists said.
The group claims that the performance of the electrostatic cleaning technique could be further improved by enhancing its intrinsice mechanism.
“Even though nano-coating seems economic wiser than electrostatic cleaning, electrostatic cleaning has promising future for mega solar power plants in arid regions by advantage of less affecting by harsh outside conditions which require frequent coating, and the potential to develop a practical mechanism for electrostatic cleaning with less capital and running costs,” they said.
The scientists published their findings in “Electrostatic cleaning effect on the performance of PV modules in Jordan,” which was recently published in Cleaner Engineering and Technology. In March, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a lab-scale solar module cleaning system prototype that uses electrostatic repulsion to cause dust particles to detach and virtually leap off the surface of panels.

Electrical standards provider UL Solutions has released a new cybersecurity protocol, UL 2941, to cover distributed energy and inverter-based resources.  Developed with the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), UL 2941 provides testable requirements for energy storage and generation technologies on the distribution grid. The new cybersecurity protocol provides a framework for photovoltaic inverters, electric-vehicle chargers, wind turbines, fuel cells and other distributed resources operating within a grid interconnection.
The new UL requirement prioritizes cybersecurity standards for power systems that deal with high penetration inverter-based resources, including those interfacing with bulk power systems for periods of instantaneous high wind, solar and hybrid/storage generation. UL 2941 will also promote cybersecurity measures across all new inverter-based resources (IBR) and distributed energy resource (DER) systems.
“The publication of UL 2941 is a milestone toward securing the distributed generation industry,” said Danish Saleem, senior energy systems cybersecurity engineer for NREL. “Equipment manufacturers, asset owners, regulators and government officials now have an established baseline for strengthening the security of their devices such as network-connected IBRs, monitoring devices, and parts of IBR systems that provide software-based and firmware-based controls.”
NREL is securing additional support from the US Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) to support the new standard.  With SETO, NREL will receive formal industry feedback on the listed requirements, develop test procedures, and perform beta testing of devices under the UL 2941 standard, said Saleem.
Products that comply with UL 2941 will be eligible for UL certification. The testing is designed to be an add-on service for inverters, complementing UL 1741, the current standard for power inverters, converters, controllers and interconnection system equipment for distributed energy resources.

It said it will invest around €150 million ($164.2 million) to expand the facility, which is currently divided into four units, by another 110 MW.
“The new unit, which is the object of the Contract, will have a wider range in generation mode compared to the previously planned unit, starting from 0 MW instead of 44 MW, and in pump mode it will be able to draw as low as 59 MW, while the previously planned unit had a minimum threshold of 77 MW,” it said in a statement.
Ignitis awarded the mentioned contract for the deployment of the fifth unit to German hydropower specialist Voigt Group, which is expected to finalize the project expansion initiative by the end of 2026.
“The wider parameter range of Kruonis PSHP’s 5th unit will significantly contribute towards the energy independence of the region, help ensure the development of renewable energy sources and the reliability of the energy system,” said the company.
The pumped hydro facility operates in conjunction with the Kaunas Hydroelectric Power Plant, which has a capacity of 101 MW and is able to cover around 3% of Lithuania's electricity demand.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Baltic country had an installed renewable energy capacity of 1,617 MW at the end of 2022. Of this capacity, 814 MW from wind power and 564 MW from photovoltaics. It is still heavily dependent on energy imports. A plan for energy independence by 2050 foresees the large scale deployment of renewable energy resources.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/19/grid-issues-plague-solars-comeback-in-czechia/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CZECHIA",MARIJA MAISCH,"APRIL 19, 2023",Grid issues plague solar’s comeback in Czechia,"On April 10, the state-owned Czech Transmission System Operator (ČEPS) was forced to switch off around 400 MW of solar, or about one-sixth of the country’s total PV capacity, in order to ensure power system stability.
“ČEPS decided to activate the curtailment plan after exhausting the normally available operational measures to control the electricity system,” said spokeswoman Hana Klímová.
Normally, the grid operator would dispatch surplus energy to neighboring countries, but that was not possible on April 10, as all potential importers were in surplus. Czechia is now looking to expand its PV fleet on the back of high energy prices and robust subsidies.
“The market itself is moving from residential towards commercial projects. We expect C&I to account for 80% of new projects which is a substantial change, as in past three years we had a 50/50 share,“ said Radek Orsag, CEO of local distributor SolSol. “We expect between 150 MWp to 200 MWp in the residential segment and 600 MWp to 800 MWp in commercial.“
The momentum will build on the fourfold increase seen in 2022, when a total of 289 MW were installed.
“We expect between 800 MW and 1,100 MW of new PV capacity to be added this year,” said Jan Krcmar, chairman of the Czech Solar Association (CSA), adding that first ground-mounted PV projects are getting off the ground after more than a decade of no activity in this market segment.
However, he warns that the Czech grid is not ready to accommodate a growing share of renewables.
“The problem with grid capacity is not a technical (issue), but rather a mathematical one,” he said.
Namely, Czechia does not have a transparent system in which investors can check whether grid capacity is available in a specific location. As a result, they sometimes apply to connect lots of capacity across the country, in order to see where they should buy land. However, this can block up the system.
“These reservations for big PV projects are the reason why some TSOs may refuse to connect more small rooftops even though the large ground-mounted installations may not at all be built,” Krcmar said. “Therefore, large self-consumption in some regions is impossible and TSOs can force customers to install much smaller systems or forbid them to inject any surpluses into the grid under the threat of penalty.”
In some parts of the country, grid bottlenecks are translating into delayed network connections. Specifically, in E.ON-owned EG.D’s network, customers are waiting eight to nine months for PV to be connected. As the payout of the rooftop PV rebate is linked to the connection, many wait almost a year to receive their money. This has a knock-on effect on installers, who are usually only paid after a rebate has been settled.
Asymmetrical mode
Another network-related disadvantage for solar in Czechia is Europe-wide unique phase metering on its low-voltage grid. This requires most inverter manufacturers to implement firmware changes in order to ensure that all solar consumption goes through one phase, enabling a higher self-consumption rate. Not all manufacturers are willing to implement such changes, so a few Chinese manufacturers claim the biggest market share.
“The biggest market share in Czechia in 2022-23 is claimed by GoodWe, Growatt, and Solax. However, due to a limited supply of asymmetrical inverters and their compatible batteries, we have had a shortage in the market,“ said Orsag of SolSol, which reportedly claims more than 30% of the Czech PV market.
The latest issue of pv magazine takes a look at how the long-established link between solar and cannabis cultivation can help improve margins as medicinal and recreational use of the drug comes out of the weeds. We take a trip Down Under to examine why communities are rebelling against planned renewable energy zones perceived as being railroaded through without sufficient local consultation, and we consider the “solar crime” wave sweeping the UK and Europe.
It is speculated that running inverters in this asymmetrical mode translates into shorter product lifespans of seven to eight years – ultimately leading to bigger costs for prosumers.
“The official reasons for such an electricity market design is grid stability and that it motivates people not to overwhelm the phases, but the unofficial reason is that TSOs collect grid connection costs and fees from that to the tune of several million euros a year and of course there are electricity merchants that make money off of this,” said Krcmar.
The phase metering could also create a huge imbalance in energy communities that are established on the principle of energy sharing. For instance, in apartment buildings, this would mean that one household could get cheap energy from solar on one phase, and another one would get expensive energy from the grid.
In response to lobbying by the solar industry, the Czech Senate told the Ministry of Industry and Trade to look into the grid design issue and potential changes that might be implemented to overcome such limitations.

Green Akku, a German supplier of solar modules for balconies, is now offering ZaunPV (fencePV), a plug-in PV system that can be easily mounted on garden fences.
The company supplies a complete set with selected solar modules, inverters, and special brackets, at a retail price of €416.81 ($456.3), plus shipping costs. The zero tax rate for residential PV is applied to end customers, while distributors have to pay the usual 19% value-added tax rate, according to Green Akku.
The PV system can be attached vertically to fences. It generates a higher amount of solar power, even when the sun is low and in winter. With manual skills, the plug-and-play system can also be installed on other types of fences. The inverters can then be connected directly to home networks via a safety plug.
Green Akku says the “ZaunPV” systems are designed for installation on garden fences, without the need for permits. In addition, it offers all materials needed to mount the systems on fences.
Green Akku recommends attaching the modules to fences that are positioned in south or east-west directions. Solar power is mainly produced in the morning and evening, when it can also be used directly in homes. With a southern orientation, the PV systems produce large amounts of solar power, especially during the middle of the day.

The system is pre-bolted and fixed, which reportedly eliminates the need for welding and drilling during installation.
“The mounting system can be installed directly on the balcony or wall without taking up extra space or causing damage to the building structure,” a Mibet spokesperson told pv magazine. “The mount is suitable for the main types of photovoltaic modules on the market, and only one or two people are needed for easy installation.”
The structure is made of aluminum with an anodized surface. The stainless-steel fastener has been coated via hot-dip galvanization, which purportedly gives it excellent anti-corrosion and anti-aging properties. It is available in natural silver or other customizable colors.
The mounting system is attached to balcony railings with curved hooks and can be adapted to different types of balconies. It can also be mounted on balcony or terrace walls with expansion bolts, on concrete garage rooftops, or on flat rooftops with cement ballast.
It allows for a PV panel title angle of 10 degrees to 30 degrees. It can withstand wind loads of up to 30 meters per second and snow loads of up to 1.0 KN/m2. The mounting system comes with a 10-year warranty and has TUV certification.
