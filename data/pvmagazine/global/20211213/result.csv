“The filters are intended to be applied on already commercially available PV products,” researcher Juan Camilo Ortiz Lizcano told pv magazine. “They can be placed directly on a commercial solar cell to change its colour appearance or on the front glass of a PV module to hide the cells and create a coloured module.”
The research team said that the dark blue or black color of standard PV modules usually does not comply with the aesthetics of historic building restoration projects. This is a barrier to the adoption of solar in areas with cultural heritage value.
“Architects and project engineers have expressed that color and shape of modules are a limiting factor for BIPV implementation,” Ortiz Lizcano explained.
The optic filters were modeled on two dielectric layers – silicon dioxide (SiO2) and silicon nitride (SiNX). The scientists said they chose those layers because they can both be deposited via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The layers are able to improve color purity and brightness, while exhibiting low parasitic losses.
“On a potential upscale scenario, a single-sided, low-capex and high throughput physical vapor deposition technique, such as sputtering, could be suitable to manufacture these devices,” the researchers said.

Ten pairs of the filters of different thickness combinations were modeled onto an interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) crystalline silicon solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 21.36%. The academics evaluated the reflectance, absorptance, and transmittance spectra of the colored solar cell and applied a color perception model to predict the color produced by the filter.
“The main objective of this work is to find ways to accurately model the effect of implementing a color filter on a solar cell in a simplified way,” they said.
Through opto-electrical simulations, the Dutch group was able to ascertain that the filters do not affect the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the cell, while the short-circuit current was negatively impacted. “Results showed that, for normal incidence of light, the green color reduces the efficiency of the cell by 0.78% absolute, whereas the brown presented a reduction of 1.40% absolute, mostly driven by current loss,” it emphasized, noting that the maximum efficiency loss recorded was 1.6%.
The researchers also discovered that the filters were also able to reduce the solar cell temperature, but this temperature drop was not found to bridge the gap in electrical performance between the cell with the filter and a reference cell without one.
“The techniques utilized to create the filters are readily available at an industrial scale, as well as the materials used to manufacture the filter,” Ortiz Lizcano said. “For these reasons, we believe that, from a technical perspective, the production of colored cells and modules with this approach should not represent a challenge.”
The researchers described the technique to fabricate the optic filters in “Colored optic filters on c-Si IBC solar cells for building integrated photovoltaic applications,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics..

Ecuador's Ministry of Energy and Non-Renewable Natural Resources of Ecuador has launched three different tenders to bring 900 MW of power generation capacity online and a transmission line.
Through one of the three procurement exercises – the Bloque de Energías Renovables No Convencionales – the Ecuadorian authorities intend to allocate 500 MW of installed power from hydroelectric, wind, solar, and biomass plants. These projects will be spread across different geographical regions of the country and their combined development is expected to require investments of US$875 million.
A second tender is for the construction of a transmission line connecting the National Interconnected System (SNI) with the Interconnected Electric Oil System (SIEP). The new line is intended to provide clean energy to the national oil industry and its construction should require an investment of $386 million. Through a third tender, the Ecuadorian government wants to build a 400 MW combined-cycle natural gas power plant.
Interested developers are permitted to submit their project proposals from today.
Ecuador announced in September a plan to tender for more than 1 GW of renewable energy. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Latin American country had installed just 28 MW of solar PV capacity by the end of 2020. Over the past seven years, it has deployed just 2 MW of PV.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/13/behind-pid-in-bifacial-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",MARK HUTCHINS,"DECEMBER 13, 2021",Behind PID in bifacial solar cells,"Potential induced degradation (PID) – a group of mechanisms caused by high voltage and potential difference between the module surface and individual solar cells that can cause damage and power loss to cells after installation – has long been a worry for the solar industry. The worst cases have seen modules lose a large chunk of their performance after a few years in the field, leading to losses for system owners and warranty claims for module manufacturers.
Plenty of fixes for PID are available at module and system level, and several manufacturers have been confident enough to label their modules ‘PID free’ in recent years. Different module technologies, however, are affected differently – and the appearance of bifacial modules in mainstream manufacturing over the past few years has led to warnings of other PID mechanisms, some causing underperformance that could be reversed overnight, and others that caused major, irreversible performance loss to the cells.
Better understanding these mechanisms was the goal of scientists led by Hochschule Anhalt in Germany, who used sophisticated imaging techniques to look into the effects of PID on cells. They report their findings in full in the paper Evolution of Corrosive Potential-Induced Degradation at the Rear Side of Bifacial Passivated Emitter and Rear Solar Cells, published in Rapid research letters.
The study noted a corrosive PID (PID-c) mechanism that could damage passivation layers in the cell, without causing any damage to the surface – altering previous understanding of the mechanisms. “We observed that there is nonreversible PID even if no surface damage is observable, which contradicts the PID-c behavior reported so far in the literature,” the group stated. “These results motivate a more detailed investigation of PID-c on bifacial solar cells and its characterization to be able to distinguish between less harmful, reversible PID-p and harmful, nonvisible, and nonreversible PID-c, which may reduce the reliability of bifacial solar cells drastically.”
The group found that oxidation of the silicon below the passivation layers caused cracks to form when the cell is placed under PID stress, leaving unpassivated areas with much lower electrical performance. “The working hypothesis is that PID-c is due to impurities (Ca, Na, K) in the etching solution used for this process step, making solar cells susceptible to PID-c, as these impurities lead to a high density of surface defects, which supports the formation of Si oxide at the interface of AlOX and Si bulk,” they explain.
The group notes that so far no reports of these PID mechanisms from modules in the field are known, although they note that such issues may well be protected by non-disclosure agreements, and also that they may take several years to appear in the field.
Various fixes might be possible in the cell design – adding additional conductive interlayers is one example given by the scientists at HS Anhalt. Until such solutions can be developed, however, they state that updates to testing standards will be key in spotting damage from PID before it’s too late. “Common test protocols are not valid for PID at the rear side. Due to the dynamic nature of PID-p and interaction with illumination, test set up needs to be able to measure possible transient performance,” HS Anhalt researcher Kai Sporleder told pv magazine. “Simultaneous illumination and a tracking of power changes of the solar cells with a temporal resolution of seconds are needed. It must be noted that the current standard protocol can lead to false-PID-results due to the lack of illumination.”

“The digging of foundations may be a barrier to the installation of a PV system at certain sites, as these works may disrupt commercial and industrial activities,” company CEO Yanis Desangles told pv magazine. “Our solution can be deployed in any industrial or commercial space in record time and at a lower cost.”

The patented solution is sold with several options. One of them, called WallBox, includes the integration of charging stations into the concrete structure. “We are integrating the charging station and we are looking at how it can interact with the PV system,” Desangles continued. “The electric vehicle is a good way to store energy and could, in my opinion, become a real mobile battery in the long term.”

The British government has allocated £285 million for the new auction round and has included solar and onshore wind among the competing energy sources for the first time since 2015. Only £10 million, however, has been devoted to solar and onshore wind, which the government defined as established technologies. Most of the funds have been earmarked for offshore wind, tidal, and floating offshore wind projects.
Through this round, the BEIS wants to contract around 12 GW of renewable energy capacity, which is more than in the previous three rounds combined.
“Onshore wind and solar are competing in an allocation round for the first time since 2015, and the government is seeking significant capacity from these technologies which will help us achieve the required levels of deployment in line with meeting climate change targets,” the BEIS said, noting that solar and wind combined may not exceed 5 GW in the auction and that a capacity cap of 3.5 GW was set for each of the two technologies in the procurement exercise.
Interested developers have until January 14, 2022, to submit their applications.

French energy company Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR), a unit of the Engie group, operates 400 km of dikes, which the company sees as an “opportunity to develop large scale vertical photovoltaics.”
This technology makes it possible to enhance the value of land that is already being utilized, while preserving its other uses. But it also involves many technical challenges, such as cable lengths and resistive losses.
As part of its “Photovoltaïque Grand Linéaire” innovation program, CNR is initially deploying three pilot projects with the aim of demonstrating the technical and economic viability of these parks which can be several tens of kilometers long.
Under development since 2017, the first pilot facility was commissioned this December on the Sablons dyke, in the Isère department. The 104 kW system was installed over 350m along a canal. It relies on bifacial PV panels placed on mounting systems with a height of 3 meters.

CNR is also working with the French Institute for Energy Transition INES.2S to optimize the architecture of thee vertical facilities. Their work made it possible, for example, to develop a software tool to determine the optimal cabling of such power plants and to make a precise inventory of the issues at stake.
From a societal point of view, the Sablons demonstrator is also accessible to users of the Rhône embankment. The park will not be fenced and the panels will be able to be approached closely, which will prefigure the more massive integration of solar photovoltaics on other types of uses such as electric vehicles, road railings, or building facades, among others.
The second demonstrator will consist of a 1.5 km long system installed on a section of the ViaRhôna dike, which runs along the Rhône river, with the panels being East-West oriented. Construction is expected to commence in 2023. In particular, it will allow the testing of innovative energy evacuation devices intended to reduce energy losses due to transport in electric cables.
The third, with a length of 10 to 20 km, should see the light of day in 2025. It will be the first full-scale demonstrator of a large linear photovoltaic park.

Mining giant Rio Tinto last week began construction on a hybrid wind-solar project in Madagascar.
The project will be owned 80% by Rito Tinto and 20% by the government of Madagascar and will power the ilmenite mine of QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) in Fort Dauphin, southern Madagascar.
The plant will comprise an 8 MW PV array featuring 18,000 solar panels – set to be commissioned in 2022 – and a 12 MW wind farm consisting of five turbines that is planned for 2023. Both will be connected to a lithium-ion storage system with a capacity of up to 8.25 MW.
It will be built and operated by CrossBoundary Energy (CBE) which has signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with QMM. “The park will supply all of QMM's electricity demand during peak production periods, and up to 60% of the demand,” said Rio Tinto in a video conference. “Thanks to this public-private funded project, we are aiming for less load shedding on the network and a reduction in the price per kWh, to make the price of electricity accessible to everyone and attractive to all investors,” added Jocelyn Raharimbola, governor of the Anosy region.
QMM hopes to reduce its annual carbon dioxide emissions by around 26,000 tonnes and its purchases of heavy fuel oil by 8,500 tonnes per year. “The Fort-Dauphin mine could be the first in the group to become carbon neutral in 2023,” said Stéphane Leblanc, Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium executive director. “Globally, our group has also raised its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, by less than 15% by 2025, and by less than 50% by 2030.”
The project is also an opportunity to foster local expertise. QMM and CBE are working with local authorities to develop manufacturing capabilities for equipment for the renewable energy industry at Ehoala Park, a 15-hectare industrial area open to national and international investors.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/13/jinkosolar-on-its-pv-capacity-expansion-plans-and-the-challenges-facing-solar/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"DECEMBER 13, 2021",JinkoSolar on its PV capacity expansion plans and the challenges facing solar,"Dany Qian, Vice President, JinkoSolar: We expected that the polysilicon shortage would continue throughout 2021; however, we underestimated the seriousness of the situation. Added to this issue were rising logistics prices, constraints on containers due to the continued impact of Covid-19, and tightened control on the electricity supply of manufacturers in China, all of which contributed to supply chain turmoil and rising costs.
We faced manufacturing cost challenges in 2021, specifically for materials and logistics which impacted our profits and forced us to make some upward cost adjustments. However, we continued to work closely with our customers to secure supply and deliver on cost improvements.
JinkoSolar will keep on investing to support the manufacturing and R&D of cutting-edge N-type technologies. Our capital investment decisions are based on two key disciplines: technology leadership, and flexible, responsive manufacturing.
The replacement of the PV module aluminum frame with a strengthened steel frame will be one option, to increase the mechanical load capabilities of module products.
The BIPV market is booming. From a supply perspective, the greatly increased efficiency of BIPV roofs and facades is driving the application. For example, JinkoSolar’s BIPV tile and fascia reach up to 21% efficiency which is higher than the average 16% seen in other conventional BIPV products. Furthermore, costs are significantly dropping thanks to scalability.
From a demand side, the carbon neutrality goals of both countries and businesses are helping to grow the market. BIPV is one of the most feasible and land-saving solutions for the deployment of solar PV.
The Chinese market comprises about 30% of our sales. Emerging markets are increasingly growing, including South Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Europe, and the U.S. Here, demand is continually robust and will see a huge jump once logistics and supply chains normalize.
Our current capacity comprises 31 GW of wafers, 19 GW of cells, and 36 GW of modules as of September 30, 2021. By the end of 2021, we will grow these to 32.5 GW of wafers, 24 GW of cells, and 45 GW of modules.
We have not ruled out manufacturing expansion into other regions. But we currently have no concrete plans other than those announced. Overall, China will continue to be the primary focus for JinkoSolar, and both our R&D center and most of our PV production will continue to be located there.
Our newest product, the Tiger Neo 620W PV module represents the most advanced N-Type TOPCon technology. Compared to passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) products, it will deliver an average of 3% more generation yield. More power per panel and more kWh per watt combined with significantly improved reliability under any real-world conditions makes it more valuable for PV project owners.
Our capacity planning is based on the long-term demand profile underpinned by the solar industry megatrends. We are seeing stronger engagement from more customers with N-type TOPcon. And we work closely with our customers to plan capacity. Thus, we'll focus our investments on advanced rather than mature technologies.
Today, every globalized company is facing persistent geographical tension. We must be more careful, conservative, and responsive to be more adaptive to the changing environment.
In our long-term forecast, we expect to see strong demand and we are preparing our manufacturing capacities to meet this. We also see that technology leadership can tackle many supply and demand challenges, and overcapacity will only occur for low-efficiency products.
We do expect structural demand to continue. But the shortage of polysilicon will continue throughout 2021 and may extend into 2022. Logistic pricing and constraints on containers could be another critical issue for next year’s market.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/13/japan-releases-new-guidelines-for-agrivoltaics-as-installations-hit-200-mw/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 13, 2021",Japan releases new guidelines for agrivoltaics as installations hit 200 MW,"Japan's New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) recently released new guidelines to develop and build ground-mounted agrivoltaic facilities, in a bid to increase the presence of such projects in the land-scarce country.
“The guidelines were prepared under the supervision of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI),” said Takeshi Magami of Chiba Ecological Energy, a leading player in Japan's agri-PV sector in Japan.
Magami told pv magazine that agrivoltaic projects are not allowed to exceed heights of 9 meters, due to building regulations. Projects that use trackers or facilities installed in barns and horticultural greenhouses have been excluded from the guidelines.
“This is because there are not enough examples in Japan and the necessary data for verification could not be collected,” Magami said.
He noted that existing solar plants where crop growth or livestock are brought in after the project planning and construction stages might not necessarily be seen as agrivoltaic plants.
“The difference between such solar power plants and projects that are considered agrivoltaic facilities is whether or not the plant is planned from the design stage to allow for optimal agricultural production,” Magami said. “Also, in the case of agrivoltaic power generation, the type of land is treated as farmland, so there are related tax benefits.”
Most of the operational agrivoltaic plants in Japan were built under the country's feed-in tariff scheme.
“There are also incentives for self-consumption or projects with a power purchase agreement (PPA),” Magami explained. “METI is currently providing a rebate covering 50% of a project's costs, but so far there are about 10 projects of this kind in Japan.”
According to recent statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 200 MW of grid-connected agrivoltaic projects were in operation in Japan by the end of September. The projects cover a total surface area of around 181.6 hectares and they are spread across the entire country.
According to Magami, the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) and the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization are currently mapping all the agricultural land suitable for agrivoltaics.
“Current estimates suggest that 10% of Japan's agricultural land could be equipped with agrivoltaic power generation, which is a potential of around 440 GW,” he said.
 
Agrivoltaics projects are deployed on farmland, so there are no taxation issues, and the land can be used very inexpensively, even in urban areas. As a result, the rapid increase in solar power plants under the country's FIT will gradually be replaced by agrivoltaics.

The company said Selkirk was identified as a preferred location after the extensive evaluation of possible options throughout Canada and the United States. The small city reportedly offers access to Canadian Premium Sand's high-grade silica sand quarry operation in nearby Seymourville, as well as abundant supplies of natural gas and renewable hydropower resources.
The company did not provide any additional details on the size of the planned investment or the factory's total production capacity. Upon completion, the plant will be North America's first solar glass factory.
“All solar panels manufactured in North America using patterned solar glass are made with glass imported from China and other Asia Pacific countries,” Canadian Premium Sand said. “Locating a solar glass manufacturing facility in Selkirk will add significantly to the sustainability and supply chain security for CPS’s solar panel manufacturing clients.”
The company first revealed plan to focus exclusively on solar glass production in October.
“Management discussions with domestic solar panel manufacturers have illustrated a need for a reliable local supply of high-quality solar glass to accommodate both current production and future growth plans,” the company said at the time, noting that its silica sand deposits offer the opportunity for it to be the first integrated manufacturer of patterned solar glass in North America.

India recorded about 46.2 GW of cumulative installed solar power capacity by Oct. 31. The state of Rajasthan leads the country with 8.6 GW of installed PV capacity, followed by Karnataka with 7.5 GW and Gujarat with 6.05 GW.
Power Minister RK Singh recently shared the new statistics in the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament). The nation now has a solar power potential of around 750 GWp, according to the National Institute of Solar Energy.
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is working to resolve land allotment and grid infrastructure challenges. The country aims to install 500 GW of non-fossil fuel sources, including solar, by 2030. 
The ministry has introduced new versions for better implementation of its solar park scheme to resolve land allotment issues. Mode-5 of the scheme allows central public sector undertakings to set up solar parks on their own land or on third-party land. Mode-8 provides states with incentives to facilitate the procurement of land.
The government has also waived Inter-State Transmission System charges for the inter-state sale of solar and wind power from projects commissioned by June 30, 2025. A dedicated transmission system for renewable energy has also been developed under Green Energy Corridor Scheme, said Singh.

Since sometime in late 2004, the United States has retired more fossil fuel capacity than it has built, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). During that period, the nation has seen cumulative solar power capacity grow from about 500 MW to 100 GW at the start of  2021.
Additionally, since 2011 through the end of 2020, the percentage of electricity from CO2 free sources has increased from 31% to greater than 41%; meanwhile, the percentage from solar and wind power alone has increased from less than 3% to greater than 11%.

The data come from EIA Form 860m, the “Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory.” To create the above chart, we added all new fossil facility capacities (blue line)–organized by new operating year in the “Operating” tab of the EIA 860m form–and then subtracted all retired fossil facilities based on when the year they closed (red line).
The yellow line is the annual net difference, which has been negative since sometime in 2012. Cumulatively, starting this year and looking backwards, if we subtract the retired fossil capacity from the new fossil capacity, we have to go all the way back to 2005/2004 before we see a net increase in fossil facility construction in the U.S.
Overall, during this roughly 18-year period, the U.S. has built 219 GW of fossil capacity, while retiring 211 GW.
More importantly, however, the power grid has been generating more clean electricity. The EIA’s Electric Power Monthly’s total electricity generation figures go back to 2011. Over the past decade, annual electricity demand remained between 4 to 4.2 million MWh.
Electricity generated by fossils dropped from 2.78 million MWh to 2.4 million, while renewables increased from 121 thousand to 470 thousand MWh — growing from 3% to over 11%.
Globally in 2020, and seemingly for the first time, the “entirety of new power generation growth in 2020 came from wind, solar, and hydropower,” according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Roughly 200 GW of that growth came from a combined wind and solar power.
And on December 1, the International Energy Agency announced that renewables are set to account for almost 95% of the increase in global power capacity through 2026, with solar PV alone providing more than half.
In 2022, the United States is projected to massively increase its solar and wind generating capacity. S&P Global Market Intelligence recently said that we will install 44 GW of new solar and 27 GW of new wind in 2022.
That would almost double last year’s record solar capacity deployment of approximately 23 GW, which itself was almost 50% higher than 2016’s prior record of approximately 14 GW.
