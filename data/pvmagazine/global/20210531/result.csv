Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of Total, said last week that the decade ahead is “one of transition.” The group has decided to place renewable energy and sustainable development at the heart of its core strategy.
“This is why Total is transforming itself and becomes TotalEnergies,” said Pouyanné.
The name change, now approved by a majority of the shareholders, is designed to illustrate all of the energy sources it focuses on: oil, gas, hydrogen, biomass, wind, and solar power.
Petroleum products represented 55% of energy sales to its customers in 2019, but TotalEnergies aims to reduce this to 35% by 2030. It also plans to invest €60 billion over the next 10 years in renewables. “We want to be among the top five renewable energy players by 2030,” said Pouyanné.
“Our growth will be geographically diversified and will be based on the already strong presence of TotalEnergies in Europe, where we have a portfolio of 5 million customers in France, 1 million in Belgium, 2 million in Spain, but also in … South America, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, India,” said Pouyanné. “We are in the process of identifying the best opportunities in the 50 countries where we operate.”
The company is basing part of its strategy on liquefied natural gas, with plans for projects in Russia and Mozambique.
“We also have the ambition to become a leader in the massive production of clean hydrogen, because it is only through the effect of size that we will be able to develop this key technology for the decarbonization of the transport sector,” said Pouyanné.
TotalEnergies is also working on batteries and electro-mobility. It plans to install 150,000 electric charging points, with partnerships in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, and London. It recently bought a stake in HysetCo, which operates a fleet of hydrogen taxis in Paris.
To offset the emissions from its oil and gas activities, the company also relies on CO2 capture technologies and natural wells. It claims to have planted 40,000 hectares of forest in the Congo.

Analysts from the Jakarta-based Institute for Essential Services Reform, Germany's Agora Energiewende and the Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology (LUT) have published a report on how solar can be at the heart of achieving a zero-carbon economy in Indonesia by mid century.
However, the message presented in the document is that the government will have to spend big up front to drive a wave of renewables deployment, low-carbon fuels and energy storage in an economic system which would be 20% cheaper than business-as-usual, but only by mid century.
The cost of rolling out 1.49 TW of renewables capacity by 2050 – 80% of it solar – and starting with a 100 GW-per-year PV charge this decade, would come in at around $2-7 billion per year to 2030 and $20-25 billion annually in the following decade. With Indonesia having invested just $1.17 billion in clean power in 2019, the projected total bill for a zero-carbon economy would be around $20-25 billion per year to 2030 and then $60 billion per year to 2040, in a country which only spends around $2 billion annually on its energy system, transport and industry.
The authors of the Deep decarbonization of Indonesia’s energy system study explain their costings are based on assumptions including the levelized cost of energy from solar falling from the $53/MWh recorded last year to $18/MWh by 2030, thanks in part to 30% efficient solar panels; cheaper batteries and electrolyzers; the introduction of carbon pricing; and household-generation ‘prosumer' activity of up to 20%.
The report's authors say the current fleet of Indonesian coal plants will cease to be competitive with renewables within 15 years and the government should embark upon a coal exit by 2025 “at the latest” to avoid stranded coal generation assets in a nation which is planning to expand its thermal power fleet from 38 GW to 57 GW by 2028.
The analysts also emphasized the urgent need to expand interconnector capacity between the island states of the archipelago nation in which Java is the largest center of electricity demand. Grid connections between the most populous island and Sumatra, Kalimantan and Nusa Tenggara will prove crucial if, as expected, electrification across sectors including transport and heating ensures Java will have to import 82% of its electricity by mid century.
In addition to the long-term economic savings and health and environmental benefits, the report stated, achieving a zero-carbon economy by 2050 would also bring more than 800,000 jobs by 2030 – 67% of them in solar – and more than 3.2 million by mid century.

While many of these changes promise significant advantages in terms of producing more power at lower cost, the products headed out to the field now are quite different to older modules, and reliability concerns are front and center for buyers, and laboratory testing will be key to spotting any issues.
PV Evolution Labs (PVEL) has put hundreds of modules through their paces in its Product Qualification Program (PQP), a sequence of production monitoring and testing that aims to reveal any weaknesses in a module that could result in failure or performance loss once installed in the field. The results are published in the seventh edition of PVEL’s module reliability scorecard.
The report names 117 products from 26 manufacturers as “top performers” in the various testing categories. However, it also notes an increase in failures – 26% of bills of materials included in this years’ scorecard had at least one failure during the testing sequence, compared with 20% in 2020.
“An unprecedented expansion of PV module manufacturing capacity is underway. New factories and production lines are vital as demand for solar power soars, but buyers must be vigilant to avoid the risks inherent to rapid growth,” commented Jenya Meydbray, PVEL CEO. “The preventable safety failures observed in this year’s Scorecard underscore the complex challenges that manufacturers face as they race to meet demand in a highly dynamic global market.”
PVEL notes that while it has tested more than 450 module bills of material to its PQP standard, only those that achieved ‘top performer’ are named in the report.
Among the reports’ key findings is that one in three manufacturers products saw failures in the junction box – including poor sealing of the lid, leakages in the junction box adhesive and junction box bypass diode failures – and that many of these occurred “out of the box” before PVEL had even begun testing of the modules.
With this in mind, the report notes that junction box quality may be something that’s frequently overlooked during manufacturing. They also note that this is one of the last stages in module production that is still most often carried out manually by factory operators, and has seen significant changes with new module designs. “A possible cause of increased failures is that some junction box production steps are difficult to automate. Junction boxes are usually installed and sealed manually, even in state-of-the-art factories where other processes are automated,” states the report. “Further, before 2018 one junction box per module was typically installed. Most modern modules contain three junction boxes to accommodate the electrical properties of half-cut cells, and precise placement is required so as not to shade cells. Imprecise handiwork in this process can result in defects.“
Aside from junction boxes, PVEL noted that the largest number of failures occurred during its mechanical stress sequences which were newly added to the PQP sequence to simulate extreme weather conditions in the field.
And as far as avoiding failures in the field goes, PVEL advises the industry to keep doing extensive testing, and for buyers to be specific about the bill of materials in a module, and only purchase those that have been tested. “From glass to junction box, PVEL’s latest Scorecard again demonstrates that the quality of a PV module depends in part upon the materials it contains –yet many buyers never request BOM details from suppliers,” said PVEL’s Chief Commercial Officer Tara Doyle. “Between supply chain instability and the ever-present push for lower prices, one cannot assume that every module sold under a given model type uses tested BOM components. Buyers must specify their desired BOM in supply contracts to achieve this.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/31/adhesive-mounting-system-for-any-kind-of-solar-modules/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"MAY 31, 2021",Adhesive mounting system for any kind of solar modules,"From pv magazine Spain
Spain-based mounting system provider Alusín Solar has developed an adhesive mounting structure for rooftop PV systems which it says is applicable to any kind of solar module.
The system is currently being tested on a 9.8 MW self-consumption solar project under construction by Spanish utility Endesa, which is part of Italian energy company Enel.
The main advantage of the system is that the roof is not perforated in any case. “As no holes are made, the risk of leaks is eliminated, which [is] something very important, for example, in ham-drying rooms,” the general director of Alusín Solar, Javier Font, told pv magazine.
The Gulpiyuri 30 system is made with aluminum bars that, instead of being fixed to the roof with screws, are attached through a double-sided adhesive. According to the manufacturer, this adhesive guarantees the necessary mechanical resistance and durability to mount the aluminum profiles that will hold the solar panels. Font affirms that the system works for any type of solar panel “because the structures adapt to any panel.”

The system was used for the first time two years ago, in Cantabria. Inekya was the EPC and Sice Renovables the installer. “The first project was developed in 2019 and remained in embryonic mode until they commissioned us [for] this great project, which served as an accelerator”, says the director of Alusín Solar.
The system must be installed with a particular cleaning technique. “All aluminum profiles must be cleaned with a specific product with a high alcoholic base to ensure that we remove any type of oil or dirt,” Font further explained. “Then, a specific primer is applied to them and, finally, the double-sided adhesive is glued to the profiles.”
The profiles leave the Alusín Solar factory in Asturias with one side already glued. To ensure perfect fixation, a gluing machine is used to apply a specific pressure. Once the material arrives on site, the roof is thoroughly cleaned. “It is the most critical process and for this a roller machine is used that cleans under pressure with 225 bars,” Font added. “Then, the other side of the profile is glued to the roof cover.” Once the profile has been glued, a 25kg roller must be passed onto it. This way a correct adherence is ensured and the solar panels are installed as with a conventional system.
But the novelty does not end there, according to Font. “During the assembly process, we installed a series of witnesses, indicators, which will allow us to monitor the system and visualize its aging from year to year to see how it behaves,” he went on to say. “We have … anchor measurement equipment adapted for this type of test and, with this system, we accompany the client throughout the entire useful life of the installation.”

The result was confirmed by China's National Institute of Metrology and beats the company's previous record of 24.9%, achieved in January.
“Material upgrades integrated into the cell process and fabrication on a practical size of 267.4cm2 of high-quality monocrystalline Czochralski (CZ) silicon substrates allowed the Company to achieve 25.25% cell efficiency,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “To achieve this extremely high solar cell efficiency using ultra-thin polysilicon, several advanced technologies have been implemented including JinkoSolar's high-quality N-type wafer, passivating contact technologies, advanced diffusion system, surface passivation, metallization of crystalline solar cells and other innovative technologies.”
In January 2020, when the cell had, still, an efficiency of 24.2%, Jinko said it was based on its HOT design and featured tunnel-oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) technology. The cell features a 267.72cm2 monocrystalline silicon substrate grown using the Czochralski method. At the time, JinkoSolar had also announced it achieved a 23.1% conversion efficiency for an n-type monocrystalline solar PV module based on this cell technology.

“We are now planning to fabricate the device in a laboratory,” research co-author Basudev Pradhan, told pv magazine. “The estimated cost of this type of perovskite-based solar panel could be 8-10 times cheaper, over the present silicon-based solar panels.” According to him, this type of solar cell can be easily manufactured by using roll-to-roll screen printing machines.
The lead-free perovskite solar cell has an n–i–p layout and is composed of a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, a TiO2 layer, a methylammonium tin iodide (MASnI3) perovskite film, a Cu2O hole transport layer (HTL), and a layer made of gold (Au).
The numerical simulations were made through the SCAPS-1D tool for thin-film solar cells developed at the Department of Electronics and Information Systems (ELIS) of the University of Ghent, in Belgium.
The academics explained that the optimization of the ETL is key to achieving high efficiencies and they found that a thickness in the range of 40-60 nm, which is nearly equal to carrier diffusion length, is ideal. The diffusion length is the average distance that the excess carriers can cover before they recombine.
“We have optimized different properties like doping density [and] the thickness of active materials as well as [the] hole and electron transport layer (HTL and ETL) for the further improvement of … device performance,” the researchers said. “Moreover, it has been observed that the varying HTL thickness has minimal impact on the device operation and its performance, whereas the thicknesses of [the] ETL and absorber layers significantly impact the device parameters.”
The simulations showed, the scientists went on to say, that the proposed cell configuration has the potential to reach a power conversion efficiency of 27.43%, a short circuit current density of 25.97 mA/cm2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.203 V, and a fill factor of 87.79%.
The device is described in the paper Performance optimization of lead free-MASnI3 based solar cell with 27% efficiency by numerical simulation, published in Optical Materials.

Germany saw the addition of 619.4 MW of new PV capacity in April, according to the latest figures from federal network agency the Bundesnetzagentur.
This compares to 548.6 MW in March this year and 380 MW in April 2020. The newly installed solar power generation capacity for the first four months of this year was 2,054 MW. In the same period a year earlier, this capacity stood at around 1,479.5 MW.
Of the monthly new additions, 243 MW was represented by PV installations built outside the tender scheme for projects ranging in size from 300 kW to 10 MW.
A strong decline in PV systems has been registered in the segment of rooftop projects with a capacity of 300 kW to 750 kW that, prior to the reform of the German renewable energy law enacted at the end of 2020, were entitled to receive a feed-in tariff and which have now been included in the project categories that must participate in tenders.
The Bundesnetzagentur also reported that the segment of ground-mounted systems up to 750 kilowatts in size, for which no tender is necessary, also declined. At 22.2 MW, this segment recorded its weakest month so far this year.
The cumulative capacity of all subsidized PV systems in Germany reached 55.5 GW at the end of April.
The federal network agency also published new compensation rates which will begin in June. The monthly decrease of solar subsidies remains at 1.4% while fixed feed-in tariffs for rooftop systems will range between €0.0758/kWh and €0.0577/kWh, depending on size.

Indian solar panel manufacturers who managed to keep production levels steady despite Covid-19 lockdowns this year are seeing slowing sales as they grapple with rising input costs. With the safeguarding duties slapped on foreign products due to be wound down in late July, domestic manufacturers are navigating turbulent waters.
Last year's nationwide lockdown has this year been replaced on a state-by-state basis, enabling manufacturers in regions less affected by the pandemic to continue operating under partial lockdown.
Speaking to pv magazine, Bharat Bhut, co-founder and director of Gujarati photovoltaics manufacturer Goldi Solar, said: “Different states have different impositions of the lockdown. We are situated in the western part of the country, in Gujarat, which had a partial lockdown. Industries were allowed to operate at a normal scale, with most … of the logistics and services running normally. We faced very few issues in the supply chain and delivery within Gujarat. Only states or regions that had a stricter lockdown faced a slowdown.”
The May edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
However, manufacturers have been faced with low demand as nationwide PV installation has slowed due to labor and logistics issues. 
“While there is no direct order stating that development [and] installation cannot continue in lockdown, we are facing logistical and labor issues,” said Bhut. “The demand has dropped as the installation is not at the pace that it should have been. We do not have enough offtake; we are seeing [less] demand than production.”
Haryana-based panel and lithium battery business Loom Solar also reported an impact on sales. 
“Almost all states had closed retail shops during this time so there was not enough demand in the market,” said co-founder and director Amol Anand. “Besides, warehouses were also closed as domestic demand reduced to 70%.”
Small-scale manufacturers have been most seriously affected, according to Anand. “Large manufacturers, with a plant capacity of more than 500 MW, at least have old orders from EPC [engineering, procurement and construction] companies so they are occupied in fulfilling them,” he said. “In comparison, small … manufacturers face many challenges, the biggest being financial liquidity.”
A sudden rise in raw material prices has applied further pressure on profit margins at a time when the duties applied to imported solar panels are about to finish.
The safeguarding duty on solar cell and module imports from China, Thailand, and Vietnam is due to expire on July 30 and the customs levy which will replace it is not set to kick in until April 1. Indian manufacturers fear that window will see Chinese manufacturers swamp the market with low-cost modules.
The situation is likely to mean long-term solar supply deals will not be viable for the immediate future, according to Goldi Solar director Bhut.
“It would be difficult to commit, on both timelines and prices, for a longer duration, owing to price fluctuations and [the] unpredictability of all variables: module prices, freight cost, unavailability of laborers etc,” he added.

Lightsource BP, which is 50% owned by the British energy company BP, has sealed an agreement with the Portuguese solar company Insun to develop five photovoltaic projects totaling 1.35 GW in Portugal.
The projects are in the initial phase of development and will be located in the Moura, Castelo Branco, Mogadouro, Chamusca and Viseu regions. Overall, these projects will require an investment of approximately €900 million.
Lightsource BP announced its entry into the Iberian energy market at the end of 2018, initially establishing itself in Madrid, and in 2019 it opened its office in Lisbon with a local team. In just two years, Lightsource BP has more than 2 GW in development in Spain and, with this transaction, it now has more than 3.5 GW in all of Iberia. The company says it is also actively exploring opportunities for green hydrogen.
In a separate press release, Lightsource BP also announced its entry into Greece after winning an auction and signing a 640 MWp co-development agreement with the local company Kiefer TEK. Specifically, 140 MW has been awarded, which represents more than 40% of the total capacity awarded in the latest Greek solar and wind auction. The awarded projects are part of a broader, 640 MW portfolio to be developed with local company Kiefer TEK which, according to Lightsource BP, will allow it to “launch itself as a major developer and investor.”
The solar market in Greece is mainly based on auctions. More than 1 GW of wind and solar projects were submitted to the last tender, of which contracts of up to 350 MW have been awarded. The average price awarded to the Lightsource BP projects was €38.50 per MWh.
The company expects more than 200 MW to come online in the next 24 months, including the 140 MW won in the auction. The company will initially invest around €160 million in the country. The co-development agreement includes Kiefer TEK as an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services contractor.
Lightsource BP will sell part of the project's electricity to the government at the offered price. The rest of the electricity will be sold to commercial and industrial customers and on the free electricity market.
With the addition of Greece, Lightsource BP has a presence in 14 countries, with a project portfolio of 20 GW on three continents.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/31/rystad-doubles-iea-calculations-on-solar-pv-required-by-2050/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MAY 31, 2021",Rystad doubles IEA calculations on solar PV required by 2050,"The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently released the first global “Net Zero by 2050″ roadmap, which was requested by the U.K. government’s COP26 leadership in advance of the UN Climate Change Framework Convention in Glasgow in November. The report expects solar to deliver 23,000 TWh of the 71,000 TWh forecast electricity generation needed by 2050, which would make it the world’s single largest source of total energy supply.
However, Rystad Energy describes itself as “much more bullish on the rise of solar PV capacity” than the IEA, predicting that more than twice as much solar, or 50,000 TWh, could be installed by 2050. “The world needs to grow its power generation capacity further in order to fulfill electrification goals in buildings, transportation and industry and solar PV is the cheapest and most convenient way,” it said.
At the recent Smart Energy Conference in Sydney, Prof. Martin Green – known for making the University of New South Wales a global hub of solar efficiency development – confidently asserted that by 2023, solar generation should become the cheapest form of energy the world has ever known. The IEA and Rystad Energy predict that wind and solar will collectively grow to make up around 70% of primary energy by 2050, with wind generation contributing 20,000 TWh by 2042.
The IEA sees emerging renewables, such as biomass, geothermal, concentrated solar and marine energy growing to 5,600 TWh of capacity by 2050. But Rystad Energy predicts they will only achieve around 1,900 TWh, because they’ll be simply eclipsed by the cost-competitiveness of solar.
Both teams of analysts foresee the peak investment level for fuel production and electricity generation hitting around $2.2 trillion in around 2030. There are also many projections on which the IEA and Rystad independently agree. Points of difference – such as the amount of solar capacity required and the future demand for oil – provide extra guidance and potential for adjustment.
The IEA expects oil demand to average 95 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2021, remaining flat until 2023 and declining from there to 72 million bpd in 2030 and 24 million bpd in 2050. Rystad Energy, on the other hand, foresees a road traffic comeback of 0.8 million bpd in 2022.
To achieve its projected fall in oil demand, the IEA assumes large-scale behavioral change in people deciding to drive less, pursue air travel far less frequently, and buy substantially greater numbers of EVs. It posits 64% EV sales as a 2030 milestone and expects biofuel to replace some 6 million bpd of oil used in transportation.
But Rystad Energy mostly argues against such scenarios, saying, for example, that the required tripling of biofuel capacity to achieve such a reduction in oil demand, is “very unlikely, as production technologies for advanced biodiesel are still under development.” It says dramatic behavioral changes in human mobility and travel are also implausible.
However, it ups the ante on the potential impact of EV sales, saying that if EVs could reach 72% of new sales in 2030 via state incentivization programs, and if society could steadily substitute clean tech in other transport sectors, it sees a path for oil demand to drop to 72 million bpd in 2038 and 36 million bpd in 2050. It says that could keep the 1.5 C target “within reach.”
The Rystad Energy take on an international plan for reducing emissions only strengthens the urgency of the IEA message. To have a chance of keeping global warming below 1.5 C “requires the immediate and massive deployment of all available clean and efficient energy technologies,” said the IEA.

By adding energy storage, customers can maximize the amount of solar that they self-consume (rather than export to the grid) as well as enjoy off-grid power when power from the grid is cut off. Being cut off from the grid is increasingly becoming a concern from remote communities or homes with the frequency and severity of bushfires increasing.

An estimated 15% of Australian households have had rooftop solar systems installed by 2020. New solar installations paired with an ESS is becoming the new standard, particularly as the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) debates whether to impose charges on exported power from homes at particular times.
Front of the Meter (FTM) installations will be largely driven by projects colocated with solar. ESSs colocated with renewables will drive 55% of the FTM forecast between 2021 and 2030. The value of avoiding curtailment, which occurs when voltage levels fall too low – the plant trips due to sudden changes frequency levels or the network service provider needs to manage congestion on the network – increases the value of having dispatchable solar assets. These are being promoted by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). This is in part driven by the expected retirement of 7 GW of thermal capacity by 2030 and a further 6.2 GW by 2035.
However, operating hybrid projects under the AEMO’s standards is complex, which creates barriers to entry, and can delay project commissioning. Therefore, for many of the colocated projects the assets will be operated independently, meaning the assets may share a grid connection but otherwise have limited interaction.
Additionally, BESSs can capitalize on the volatility recorded in frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) or wholesale markets. Most battery energy storage systems (BESSs) in Australia will be utilizing merchant markets, primarily focused on the FCAS in addition to arbitraging prices in the wholesale market when prices spike.
On average, frequency services make up 85% of revenues for currently operational BESS, however a wide range of revenues are possible from the wholesale market, where average net returns from price wholesale arbitrage can be anywhere from AU$39/kW to $211/kW (US$27–245/kW) depending on the year, the state, average number of cycles, and duration of the system.
Increased demand during the summer months paired with generators tripping under hot conditions or as a result of bushfires or storms, often causes summer prices to spike as high as AU$14,500/MWh (US$9,974/MWh) in wholesale markets. For example, on January 31, 2020, when transmission lines in South Australia unexpectedly tripped when a tornado hit, FCAS prices spiked to over AU$1,000/MW (US$691/MW) multiple times throughout the day. This event alone created over AU$60 million (US$41 million) of revenue for all operational BESS in Australia.
One significant issue often overlooked is the challenge in securing financing for these large scale BESS. In fact, despite making up the majority of revenues for existing operational systems, FCAS revenues are often not considered bankable enough to be taken into account in the business case – meaning some other revenue stream must form the basis. This has meant that the majority of operational FTM BESS today have some form of government funding, usually from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), or are turning to fixed contracts for system security services to provide a fixed baseline revenue.
Another growing trend in Australia is the utilization of ESS to defer investments into network infrastructure. This is applicable to both FTM and BTM solutions. Where BTM standalone power systems (SAPS), typically solar PV plus a storage system, are replacing new lines to the fringe of the grid homes and farms (buildings or towns are often only connected by a single electricity line). Or FTM where large-scale ESS are aiding with congestion and mitigating outages on transmission lines. This is an issue that will only grow as the amount of renewables installed increases in a grid with such a dispersed population.
Overall, IHS Markit continues to see Australia as a key growth market for both BTM and FTM ESS driven by the fundamental need to support such a distributed electricity network that is rapidly transitioning away from thermal power to renewables. However, the market remains volatile as federal level policies still do not fully align with rapid transition that state governments are pushing for.
Additionally, the slow – relative to the speed of renewable installations – transition in market structure paired with the perceived risk in merchant markets creates challenges to develop bankable business cases for large scale BESS.

A fire at the Callide C coal-fired power station caused chaos in Queensland’s electricity system last week, leaving about 477,000 homes without power up and down the Australian state's coastline.
CS Energy, the state government-owned energy company – and the operator of the 1.5 GW Callide Power Station near Biloela, central Queensland – said a fire occurred in one of the turbine halls at the plant on Tuesday. It said the event immediately forced both units at Callide C offline. That caused such instability that all operating units at Callide B also tripped.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) said the “significant power system event” also tripped multiple transmission lines and forced power stations at Gladstone, Stanwell, Yarwun and Mackay offline, resulting in about 3.1 GW disappearing from the Queensland grid.
A Powerlink spokesperson said the impact occurred within milliseconds of the incident at Callide. It sparked outages across the state, blacking out hospitals, airports, shopping centres, sewage treatment plants, traffic lights, businesses and households. Most of those who lost power were back online within hours. A spokesperson for New South Wales energy provider Essential Energy said tens of thousands of residents bordering the Gold Coast also lost power for a period.
In the wake of the incident, AEMO issued a “lack of reserve” (LOR) notice at 4.45 pm and a forecast LOR3 notice at 5.07 pm identifying the potential for electricity demand to exceed supply in Queensland. It later called on households to avoid using heavy appliances to “minimize stress on the system” until at least 9.30 pm to mitigate the risk of further brownouts or blackouts. This notice was later cancelled at 7.13 pm due to sufficient power supply from generators returning to service around the state.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said on Wednesday that the grid had been stabilized.
“We don’t expect to see any blackouts as a result of this incident,” he said. “The power in Queensland is stable. We worked closely across all agencies and with the national Australian Energy Market Operator to make sure they were able to bring on additional supply. We have a diverse and publicly owned generation network in Queensland – everything from nearly 700,000 households with rooftop solar, solar farms, wind farms, pumped hydro and a fleet of coal-fired generators and they’re all operating all full steam.”
Queensland Conservation Council Director Dave Copeman said the incident had reinforced the need for more utility-scale batteries to be established within the state to shore up grid stability. Copeman said the best way to provide cheap, clean electricity to Queenslanders is by investing in renewable energy and storage, including large batteries.
“This illustrates the devastating impact that relying on large, geographically concentrated thermal coal units can have, particularly as they age,” he said. “The piece of infrastructure transmission operators most needed when this failure occurred was a large-scale battery. It could have been delivering power to support the grid within seconds and may have prevented the wider network failures.”
Batteries have emerged as a critical component of Australia’s energy network, with the Energy Security Board’s (ESB) Post 2025 Market Design Directions Paper stating the projected influx of new renewable energy over the next two decades will need to be supported by between 6 GW to 19 GW of new flexible, dispatchable resources.
Queensland already has a number of grid-connected batteries operating, including the Lakeland Solar Farm (1.4 MW/5.3 MWh) in northern Queensland and one at the Kennedy Energy Park (2 MW/ 4 MWh) near Hughenden. Singapore-based developer Vena Energy has already commenced construction of a 100 MW/150 MWh grid-scale battery near Wandoan in the Western Downs, while AGL Energy plans to build a 100 MW/150 MWh battery next to the 453 MW Cooper’s Gap wind farm near Kingaroy.
French renewables developer Neoen is also planning to build 150 MW of battery storage as part of its proposed 460 MW Western Downs Green Power Hub. It will be constructed near Chinchilla. It has also submitted plans to develop a 100 MW battery project in Queensland’s far north.
In addition, the Queensland government has announced plans to install five large-scale, network-connected batteries, with a combined capacity of 40 MWh, in regions across the state as part of a community battery trial. Copeman said those batteries will be increasingly important as coal-fired power plants are retired.
The 825 MW Callide C site, commissioned in 2001, is one of Australia’s newest coal-fired plants. But Copeman said the technology has failed to keep pace with the rapidly transitioning energy network.
“When Callide C was built in 2001, it was talked about as having a 25-year life span. It’s now 20 years old,” he said. “Queensland coal has been forced to operate more flexibly than it was designed to as solar has entered the market in recent years. This potentially makes units more vulnerable to failure. Even if this incident was unrelated, it still shows the potential disruption to Queensland’s electricity supply possible in future.”
Rystad Energy Senior Analyst Dave Dixon said Queensland’s fleet of coal generators only has a very small ramping capacity, compared to Victoria and New South Wales. It can manage only 500 MW a minute, due to its reliance on coal, compared to more than 2.5 GW in New South Wales. But Dixon claimed that batteries can ramp up to 100% of capacity in less than a second.
Investigations into last week's blaze have already commenced. CS Energy CEO Andrew Bills has said that an initial inspection has revealed that unit C4 at Callide C, which is jointly owned by CS Energy and Intergen, was heavily damaged. He said it will take some time to fully understand the cause of the failure and what will be required to repair the unit, but warned that it could be a year before it is back online.
“It is too early to say with certainty when Unit 4 will be operational again, however based on currently available information, we have informed the market operator this morning that the unit will be available in 12 months,” the company said in a statement. “We are assessing the damage to other three units. This will be our priority today so that we can work out a plan to bring those units back safely.”
