In a report on emergency interventions to address high energy prices, the commission concluded that “a prolongation of these measures does not seem necessary or advisable at the current time” because “the EU electricity market supply and prices have now changed considerably from the record high levels last year.” The report states that the electricity demand reduction measures, infra-marginal revenue cap, and retail price- setting rules “contributed to a calming of the European energy markets, alongside the other emergency proposals adopted in 2022.”
The infra-marginal revenue cap on renewables, nuclear, and lignite sets a €0.18/kWh price cap and has been in place since December 2022 in most member states. It is in force until June 30, 2023, except for Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain, where it will be applied until Dec. 31, 2023.
In Cyprus, the end of the measure will be based on a decision issued by the regulator. In Slovakia, the measure will be in place until Dec. 31, 2024. And in Germany, the period of application can be extended until April 30, 2024, according to the report. The country is reportedly still deciding whether it will extend the measure.
The commission said the implementation of the infra-marginal revenue cap was heterogeneous. In a public consultation on a potential prolongation, most respondents sided against it, arguing that this heterogenous implementation resulted in uncertainty for investors and discouraged new investments. They also said the measure was difficult to implement and had high administrative costs compared with their benefits.
It said it had only limited data to report on the revenues generated from the implementation of the revenue cap. Bulgaria collected BGN 321 million ($176 million) in December 2022, while Lithuania collected approximately €10 million by March 9, 2023. Revenues from the cap were originally estimated to exceed €50 billion.
“However, those assumptions already seem unlikely to materialize by the time of the reporting,” said the commission.
The report highlights the concern that the emergency measure's impact on existing power purchase agreements (PPAs) and its discouragement of new ones are key factors in the decision to not extend the revenue cap. Specifically, it raises concerns about situations where the cap applies to fictitious income based on wholesale electricity prices, which could result in producers being forced to sell electricity at a loss.
“A potential prolongation of the measure would hinder one of the objectives set out in the electricity market design proposal, namely to incentivize the uptake of PPAs and ensure as liquid a PPA market as possible,” concluded the commission.

“Hungary imports 76% of its energy, and reducing the reliance on natural gas and increasing the share of electricity from alternative sources are key goals,” tweeted Energy Minister Csaba Lantos. “The inauguration of the Mezőcsát power plant, the country's largest solar farm, is a step toward achieving these objectives.”
Hungary-based PolSolar, the project developer, raised €174 million ($185.9 million) in in April 2022 through the issuance of a 15-year bond under the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme (BGS), which is managed by the National Bank of Hungary. These funds have facilitated the completion of the Mezőcsát solar plant. The project will sell power to the national grid under a contract for difference (CfD) scheme.
The latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) show that Hungary had installed 2.98 GW of solar by the end of 2020. New capacity additions only reached 20 MW in 2022.

Anderson Optimization's software assists developers in accurately assessing the feasibility of solar plant construction, considering factors such as interconnection, terrain analysis, solar potential, and environmental considerations.
“Usually, developers of solar projects use different software platforms to manage the different tasks of the design process of photovoltaic projects,” a PVcase spokesperson explained. “The data fields, however, differ considerably from one platform to another, posing challenges in data reconciliation and transfer, especially in European markets where some data is not yet digitized. This creates an additional industry challenge known as ‘data risk'.”
PVcase aims to address these challenges by integrating its own software with Anderson Optimization's, providing a comprehensive solution on a single platform. While Anderson Optimization's software was not previously available in Europe, PVcase will launch it in the German, Spanish, and UK markets during Intersolar Europe in Munich next week. The two companies have already synchronized the data fields used by their respective platforms, enabling seamless data transfer, said PVcase.
PVcase CEO David Trainavicius stated that European developers would see a significant reduction in the project design process, going from several weeks down to approximately 20 minutes.
“Our customers always tell us that they want a comprehensive software platform that allows them to manage the entire project life cycle,” added Jake Anderson, the CEO of Anderson Optimization. “This would allow them to drastically reduce costs and speed up project deadlines.”

Torrent Power, a private-sector integrated utility in India, has signed an agreement with the state government of Maharashtra to develop three pumped storage hydro projects aggregating to 5.7 GW capacity.
The projects will involve an estimated investment of INR 27,000 crore ($3.27 billion) and will provide employment to around 13,500 people during the construction phase.
The company plans to execute the projects over a period of five years. The projects would be executed at three sites: Karjat (3 GW) in Raigarh district, Maval (1.2 GW), and Junnar (1.5 GW) in Pune district. All of the sites are off-stream, and the projects are planned to provide a minimum of six hours of energy storage daily.
Torrent Power, with a turnover of around $3 billion, is one of the largest companies in the Indian power sector, with a presence across the entire power value chain of generation, transmission, and distribution.
The company currently has an aggregate installed generation capacity of 4.1 GW, mainly consisting of clean sources such as gas (2.7 GW) and renewables (1.07 GW). It also has a renewable capacity of 0.7 GW under development and is now strategically entering the storage space.
In a separate development, state-owned hydropower producer NHPC is exploring pumped storage projects in several states, including Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Odisha.
NHPC has completed the pre-feasibility report (PFR) for the Indira Sagar Omkareshwar Pumped Storage Scheme (525 MW) in Madhya Pradesh. It has also submitted the PFR for the Tekwa-2 Pumped Storage Scheme (800 MW).
In July 2022, NHPC signed an MoU with DVC to explore the formation of a joint venture company for hydropower and pumped storage projects. NHPC has received the letter of award for preparing the PFR for the Panchet Hill Pumped Storage Project (600 MW).
With the increasing share of renewable power in the grid, energy storage becomes crucial for load management and meeting peak demand. Pumped storage hydro, a proven and cost-effective technology, involves two water reservoirs at different elevations. Water is pumped to the upper reservoir during excess power and released to generate power during peak demand.
Pumped storage hydro offers advantages over batteries, including lower cost, longer lifespans of 40 years, and the ability to provide six to 10 hours of storage with multiple cycle operations during the day.

The document highlights the barriers to reaching 60 million installed heat pumps by 2030, according to REPower EU targets.
“The EU heat pump accelerator aims to overcome these barriers and create an improved framework for the accelerated deployment of heat pumps in line with the EU’s climate and energy security objectives,” the document reads.
The barriers include upfront and operational costs, lack of consumer information, supply chain bottlenecks, installer shortage, and inadequate power sector and energy system integration. The document noted that while at least 60% of heat pump manufacturing happens in Europe, the industry still relies heavily on non-European manufacturers for critical components like compressors.
The proposed solutions include making clean heating the standard by ending the sale of standalone fossil fuel boilers via Ecodesign, supporting European industry leadership, integrating energy systems with flexible heat pumps, facilitating consumer information and affordability through measures like 0% VAT and lower taxation on electricity, and developing the necessary skills and workforce.
“Europe is closing the door on fossil fuels and getting renewable on the path to net zero,” said Thomas Nowak, secretary general of the European Heat Pump Association. “Heat pumps are now recognized as having a crucial role, as shown by the wide range of contributors to this Heat Pump Accelerator. We thank the European Commission for receiving the Accelerator and urge it to take heed of its recommendations. Above all, the sector needs a clear signal from policymakers of their long-term support.”
A number of organizations have contributed to the initiative, including Agora Energiewende, Daikin Europe, Danfoss, the Environmental Coalition on Standards (ECOS), EIT InnoEnergy, and the European Partnership for Energy and the Environment (EPEE).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/07/photovoltaic-thermal-solar-panel-based-on-water-storage-tank/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,IRELAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 7, 2023",Photovoltaic-thermal solar panel based on water storage tank,"Researchers at the Dublin City University in Ireland have proposed a new design for photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) modules based on a water tank that simultaneously provides PV panel cooling and generates hot water for domestic use.
The group said its PVT water collector represents an attractive option to enhance the overall performance of a PV panel, with the storage tank working as a typical gas-powered geyser used for the production of hot water for domestic use.
“In general, gas-fired geysers are widely used in Pakistan to heat water for daily use, and in the last few years, Pakistan is facing a problem of gas load-shedding due to which production of hot water in winter is crucial,” it explained, noting that the proposed PVT solution would represent a Co2 emission-free solution for supplying hot water. “Water from the overhead tank is flown by gravity which is heated in geysers and then utilized in domestic operations.”
The system consists of a 170 W photovoltaic panel connected to a water tank placed at the backside of the PV module itself. The storage tank has a size of 150 cm × 66 cm x 4 cm and is made of wood coated with an aluminum sheet to avoid the degradation of the wood due to water.
“The circuit of the PV module was saved by using a rubber gasket to avoid contact of water with it,” the scientists explained. “Two headers, one for an inlet and one for an outlet, had been included. Five steel rods were bolted at the backside of the wooden sheet for structural support.”
The team compared the performance of the PVT module with that of a reference PV panel without the water storage tank. It ascertained that the PVT panel ensured high heat transfer between the PV surface and the tank, thus being able to considerably reduce the operating temperature of the PV unit. According to the group's calculations, the PVT panel had a 19% higher power yield than its pure PV counterpart.
“In addition, the hybrid PVT module was capable to produce hot water which was considered to be an additional advantage,” the academics stated, noting that the PVT panel uses around 50.04% of incoming solar radiation while the PV utilizes only 11.4%. “So, it can be concluded that hybrid PVT can be effectively utilized to produce both electrical energy and hot water from a single system.”
They introduced the system in the paper “Energy and stress analysis of a hybrid photovoltaic thermal module,” which was recently published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering.
An international research group led by the Imperial College London recently conducted a comprehensive review of all photovoltaic-thermal system designs developed to date at both the research and industry level.

The Melbourne Market Authority has switched on what is believed to be the largest rooftop solar system in the Australian state of Victoria. The 2.4 MW solar carpark will be used to load and park trucks. The system produces 3,000 MWh of solar energy per year and was installed by NGE / Beon Energy Solutions.
The carpark serves as the initial phase of a three-stage project, with the subsequent stages focusing on installing solar panels on existing market and warehouse roof space at the authority's 67-hectare site in Melbourne.
“Once the entire project is complete, the market will host a 10 MW rooftop solar panel system, which will be one of the largest rooftop installations in Australia,” said Melbourne Market Authority CEO Mark Maskiell.
The solar carpark system features 450 W LG panels and SolarEdge commercial inverters.
The newly constructed loading zone and existing warehouse now house 5,432 solar panels, which are projected to offset 10% of the wholesale market's yearly energy consumption and reduce carbon emissions by 1.77 tons.
The Melbourne Market Authority, a Victorian government entity, links fresh food and flower growers with wholesalers, retailers and distributors.

This kind of silicon offers the advantage of enabling the production of ultrathin and flexible wafers with lower impurity levels, which result in exceptional light-absorbing properties and low production costs. “Black silicon is a random nanotexture that reduces surface reflectance from all directions to a minimum, so that Si becomes black to the naked eye as opposed to conventional micron-scale random pyramids,” the scientists explained.

They used deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) at cryogenic temperatures to produce Si substrates with different thicknesses down to 10 µm. This process is a plasma-based etching technique that yields deep holes and trenches with steep sides in silicon wafers. 
The researchers utilized a Si substrate with a thickness of 40 µm to build a solar cell with IBC architecture, which they said can exploit the optical advantage of a bSi front surface in the material. “The IBC c-Si solar cell structure used is based on vanadium oxide (VOx) and laser processed phosphorus-doped silicon carbide stacks as hole and electron transport layers, respectively,” they explained.
The cells were also relying on a surface passivation layer made of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and silicon carbide (SiC). “We chose a conformal Al2O3 layer deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) as it offers excellent surface passivation of bSi nanotexture, achieving average lifetimes above 250 µm in our bSi ultra-thin wafers,” the scientists said.
The PV device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 16.4%, an open-circuit voltage of 633 mV, a short-circuit current density of 35.4 mA cm−2 , and a fill factor of 73.4%. For comparison, a reference cell with a polished front surface and without the black silicon wafer achieved an efficiency of 11.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 600 mV, a short-circuit current density of 27.1 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 70.7%.
“External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) results with bSi front surface improve the identical device with a polished front surface in all the measured spectrum ranges, from near-infrared (NIR) to ultraviolet (UV), demonstrating that the optical properties can be successfully transferred to electrical photovoltaic performance in a final, encapsulated, cell,” the scientists concluded, noting that further work is needed to improve light-trapping effectiveness of the front bSi texture.
They presented the new wafer and cell technology in the paper “Black Ultra-Thin Crystalline Silicon Wafers Reach the 4n2 Absorption Limit–Application to IBC Solar Cells,” published in Nano-Micro Small. The research group includes academics from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Spain and the Aalto University in Finland.

VDMA said this week that German PV equipment providers recorded a slight decline of 3% in incoming orders last year, with sales falling 7% year on year. All in all, this points to a demand recovery, according to the VDMA.
The pandemic's impact has largely subsided, with fewer supply disruptions in electronic components compared to the previous year, according to the VDMA. German photovoltaic machine builders generated approximately 85% of their sales from silicon and thin-film solar cell production systems, while the remaining portion comprised module integration equipment and machinery for ingot and wafer fabrication.
Currently, China dominates photovoltaic production, with German PV equipment suppliers exporting 78% of their products, of which 57% went to Asian customers. Jutta Trube, Head of VDMA Photovoltaic Production Equipment, noted that the Asian solar market remains the largest sales contributor, while the American and European markets show increasing attractiveness.
The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is driving the establishment of solar factories, leading to an 18% export share for German manufacturers in the Americas region in 2022. European mechanical engineering companies, including those in Germany, achieved a 22% total turnover share. Both regions experienced a 7% increase in turnover last year.
“It is quite clear that solar photovoltaic production is growing in regions with high incentives,” said Peter Fath, managing director of RCT Solutions. “The United States, with the Inflation Reduction Act, has created a clear framework for supporting local production, which benefits European machine and plant manufacturers.”
Fath said that there is also a positive trend in Europe, which can be enhanced through the implementation of effective industrial policies. He noted that manufacturing costs play a crucial role in investment decisions related to solar production lines.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/07/cambodia-to-scrap-rooftop-pv-capacity-charge-introduce-new-tariffs/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CAMBODIA",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JUNE 7, 2023","Cambodia to scrap rooftop PV capacity charge, introduce new tariffs","Rooftop PV installations are heavily penalized in Cambodia, with solar arrays capped at 50% of the contracted load and charged a monthly capacity fee. At the end of April, the nation's Ministry of Mines and Energy published a document, “Principles for permitting the use of rooftop solar power in Cambodia” that outlines new principles to streamline the permitting process of rooftop PV. It proposes the replacement of actual capacity charges with new tariffs and quotas for installations.
The changes are a response to the garment industry’s wish to install more rooftop solar to “reduce the carbon footprint of goods and products,” as required by international buyers, according to the document. The brief repeatedly emphasizes the government’s belief that utility-scale solar is the best way to reduce electricity prices for all consumers and minimize grid instability issues. It thus introduces a “compensation tariff of variable energy from rooftop solar” under the principle of “fairness in electricity price among all parties.”
The new tariff is calculated according to a formula with three parts. The first is the price of exporting electricity from the national grid, payable to the electricity distributor. The second is the price equivalent to grid losses, payable to the state-owned utility Electricite du Cambodge (EDC). The third is a tariff based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for each installation.
Asked whether the new tariff is a positive development for solar in Cambodia, Natharoun Ngo Son, country director at Energy Lab, gave pv magazine an ambivalent answer.
“Yes and no. Yes, it is better, because with the capacity charges, first there is a 50% cap, and then the capacity charge applies whether you use your system or not,” said Ngo Son. “Now, the tariff is paid on a usage base, which is better. Moreover, before injecting excess electricity into the grid wasn’t allowed and now it is.”
However, PV system owners injecting power into the grid would do it for free, as net metering and net billing are not allowed in Cambodia. Ngo Son argued that grid constraints, among other issues, mean it is unlikely that public utilities will implement such regulatory accelerators soon.
Ngo Son expressed concerns about the other side of the new tariff, stating that “no, it is not necessarily better. The big question we all have is: We have a formula, but what does it mean? What is the real cost the private sector will end up paying? No business today understands what the new regulations mean in terms of cents per kWh and therefore in terms of payback period. Some solar PV actors noted that it has slowed down their current operations and created uncertainty.”
Although the policy document was signed and published on April 25, 2023, its official status is currently unclear, as it has not been published on the Ministry of Mines and Energy website. Ngo Son said it is expected to be published in the coming weeks after an official consultation with the private sector takes place probably next week. He noted that an implementation schedule has not been made public yet.
The document also introduced quotas for rooftop PV installations, allocated on a first-come-first-served basis per province, provincial capitals, and zones. However, it does not specify how many quotas there are, how these are defined, or what the status of existing PV systems is within the quota scheme.
“Upon receiving a permit from Electricity Authority Cambodia, the Applicant shall commence [installing] the rooftop solar power within three months from the date of notification,” the document reads.
Despite leaving many questions unanswered, Ngo Son sees the new policy as a positive development for solar in Cambodia. This April, the Cambodian government approved five renewable energy projects totaling 520 MW. Of these, four are PV projects, comprising a 150 MW project in Pursat province, an 80 MW project in Prey Veng province, a 60 MW project in Kampong Chhnang province, and a 60 MW project in Svay Rieng province.
Cambodia published its “Power Development Plan 2022-2024” (PDP) in December 2022, setting a solar additions target of 3,155 MW by 2040. According to the latest statistics of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Southeast Asian country had 456 MW of installed solar capacity at the end of 2022.
