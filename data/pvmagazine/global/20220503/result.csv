Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have applied the process to address the low proton conductivity of cells. “Their acid-treated cells produced about 200% more hydrogen per area at 1.5 V at 600 C than did any previous cell of its type, and worked well down to 350 C with very little performance decay over extended operation,” the institute's Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering said. The team also found out that the top surface of the dense electrolyte is usually flat. In contrast, the bottom surface of the porous electrode sitting on it is bumpy, and the two come into contact in only a few places. “That precarious interface leads to both structural de-lamination and poor proton passage from the electrode to the electrolyte,” said Ju Li, a paper co-author, likening the method to sandblasting a surface before applying paint to increase adhesion. A growing body of research is currently analyzing the options of electrolyzers working at temperatures between 350 C to 600 C. The interest in electrolyzers working at these “intermediate” temperatures is growing. “Reduced operating temperature enables cheaper materials for the large-scale assembly, including the stack,” said Idaho National Laboratory researcher and paper co-author Dong Ding.
An international team involving Oslo-based CoorsTek Membrane Sciences and Norwegian research entity Sintef has shown that it is possible to preserve the efficiency of proton ceramic reactors also when scaling up from cell to stack level, which usually poses challenges to the distribution of heat and gas flows and electric current. “We demonstrate a 36-cell, well-balanced reactor stack enabled by a new interconnect that achieves complete conversion of methane with more than 99% recovery to pressurized hydrogen, leaving a concentrated stream of carbon dioxide. Comparable cell performance was also achieved with ammonia, and the operation was confirmed at pressures exceeding 140 bars,” the team said. They noted that the stacking of proton ceramic reactors into practical thermo-electrochemical devices demonstrates their potential in hydrogen production. Experts from Valencia's Institute of Chemical Technology (ITQ) participated in the project. 
ArcelorMittal has successfully tested the use of green hydrogen in the production of direct reduced iron at its steel plant in Contrecoeur, in the Canadian province of Quebec. “The objective of the test was to assess the ability to replace the use of natural gas with green hydrogen in the iron ore reduction process. During this first test, 6.8% of natural gas was replaced with green hydrogen during a 24-hour period, which contributed to a measurable reduction in CO2 emissions. The green hydrogen used in the test was produced by a third-party-owned electrolyzer and was then transported to Contrecoeur,” the company said. It is assessing the possibility of carrying out further tests in the coming months by increasing the use of green hydrogen. The potential use of electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen in Contrecoeur will mostly depend on the availability of sufficient electricity to power the units.
German Minister of Economic and Climate Affairs Robert Habeck and his Indian counterpart, R.K. Singh, have signed a memorandum of understanding on green hydrogen cooperation. The cooperation activities will include production, processing, and the application and transport of green hydrogen. “Due to the good conditions for renewable power generation, India can become a globally important production location for green hydrogen in the long term,” said the Ministry of Economic and Climate Affairs, adding that the country is interested in selling electrolyzers to the second-largest country in the world. The cooperation agreement aims to establish a task force within the Indo-German Energy Partnership – the so-called Indo-German Energy Forum. The task force would facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience in regulation, standards and safety procedures. In March, Habeck visited Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The German government also agreed on a hydrogen collaboration with Norway. 
The Canadian province of British Columbia has announced the opening of Vancouver Island’s first public hydrogen-fueling station. The government wants to expand the hydrogen-fueling network to encourage more British Columbians to switch to hydrogen-fueled cars. “Vancouver-based Hydrogen Technology and Energy Corporation (HTEC) has partnered with 7-Eleven Canada to open Vancouver Island’s first public hydrogen-fueling station at an Esso in Saanich. The Saanich station received CAD 500,000 ($389,350) from the Province’s CleanBC Go Electric program and CAD 1 million from Natural Resource Canada’s Electric Vehicle and Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Deployment Initiative,” said the provincial government.
C-Job Naval Architects and LH2 Europe have designed a brand new class of liquid hydrogen tankers. They measure 141 meters and each have a storage capacity of 37,500 cubic meters. “Liquid hydrogen provides unique challenges in ship design and engineering. As a comparison, LNG tankers use ballast water to compensate the loss of weight following delivery to ensure enough draft. As liquid hydrogen is high in volume but 20 times lighter than LNG, this required a unique solution. We have created a trapezium-shaped hull design which creates enough deck space to fit the tanks without the need for ballast,” said Job Volwater, CCO of C-Job. The tankers should be available commercially by the end of the decade. “LH2 Europe aims to have a full liquid hydrogen supply chain ready by 2027,” said Peter Wells, CEO of LH2 Europe. “We plan to initially deliver 100 tons per day (t/d) of green hydrogen and ramp up production to 300 t/d within three years, depending on demand.” The vessel is powered by hydrogen fuel cells. 
California-based RIX Industries recently presented the advantages of methanol-to-hydrogen generation technology, underscoring how the shipping industry is increasingly looking at hydrogen. “This new method of producing hydrogen offers greater flexibility to existing ships by repurposing tanks already in use,” the company said. For such designs, hydrogen is not stored, but instead created as needed through a reforming process, allowing the methanol-to-hydrogen propulsion strategy to be distributed across a vessel’s infrastructure. “While hydrogen is an appealing answer industry-wide, its deployment is deeply complicated by cryogenic temperature requirements and/or high-volume, high-pressure storage. However, the ability to generate hydrogen on-demand is breaking through these barriers, tapping into safe, convenient methanol to eliminate complexity and achieve decarbonization,” said Bryan Reid, chief sales officer for RIX Industries.

According to Frank Wouters, vice president energy transition for Reliance Industries, the six GCC countries – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates – could export up to $200 billion of green hydrogen by 2050. There has been progress in the GCC countries, with green hydrogen powered by solar and wind emerging as an alternative to the hydrogen carbon industry, he said.  
The United Arab Emirates is working on including hydrogen in its next five-year energy plan, which will be released this year. Saudi Arabia has announced a target of 4 million tons by 2030, or about 25 % of the global market. 
Sumit Shikhar, business development lead at EDF Renouvelables Middle East, said energy security has increased the momentum behind green hydrogen. Developers are teaming up with governments and stakeholders, especially tech providers supporting green hydrogen. Engineering, procurement and construction companies are considering more integrated solutions that start with renewables and go up to hydrogen and its derivatives, said Shikhar. Industry advisers are also bringing know-how to the region. 
Gurmeet Kaur, a Middle East Solar Industry Association (MESIA) board member, said it is important for the private sector to move into the hydrogen space and work with governments. She said that the key drivers to motivate private sector players in hydrogen include sufficient pipelines of projects, sensible risk allocation in contracts, and flexible, collaborative contracting. 
Abhay Sinha, a strategic adviser for MESIA, said there is now a greater focus on the supply side of hydrogen. However, he said that he believes that the focus should be more on the demand side. Policymakers need to identify customers, as hydrogen is a commodity, he added.  
Shikhar talked about what the region could achieve, assuming that the current challenges are addressed. From the production side, in the short-term period of three to four years, they could achieve $3/kg of hydrogen, he claimed. If governments help in eliminating the challenges, the price would be lower, he argued.  
Kaur said that governments should shape regulatory frameworks. She noted that there are no specific regulations that govern hydrogen projects at present. However, the Abu Dhabi government is now launching tenders to appoint advisers on hydrogen frameworks, and that could lead to new hydrogen regulations, she said.

Germany’s Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has reported that 731.3 MW of new PV systems were registered in March under the EGG incentive regime. The figure marks a significant increase from February, when new additions hit 422 MW, and from March 2021, when newly installed PV capacity came in at 548.6 MW.
According to the agency, developers also installed eight large-scale solar projects in March, totaling 175.87 MW. Those installations brought monthly PV capacity additions to around 916 MW.
Including those unsubsidized projects, the country's newly installed PV capacity for the first quarter of 2022 hit 1,972.5 MW, which compares to 1,325 MW in the same period a year earlier. The cumulative capacity of all subsidized and unsubsidized PV systems in Germany reached around 58.2 GW by the end of March.
The Federal Network Agency also published new compensation rates for May. The monthly decrease of solar subsidies remains at 1.4%, while fixed feed-in tariffs for rooftop systems up to 100 kW will range between €0.0643 ($0.0677)/kWh and €0.0488/kWh, depending on size. All systems exceeding this threshold will be given a feed-in tariff of €0.0440.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/03/australian-solar-companies-battle-to-keep-staff/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 3, 2022",Australian solar companies battle to keep staff,"From pv magazine Australia
Australian solar companies are struggling to find workers, leaving some forking out as much as 30% above normal salaries to find candidates, with others seriously revising their corporate strategies.
Andy McCarthy, CEO of RACV Solar, said that his company – which has one of the industry’s largest in-house teams – has certainly grappled with the issue. “Everyone has,” he told pv magazine Australia.
McCarthy said the shortages are so pervasive the best members of his team are getting approached weekly by companies looking to recruit.
The situation has led RACV Solar to pursue a range of measures. In April, the company acquired the Cola Solar, having bought Great Ocean Solar and Electrical not long before. These were, McCathy said, “capability acquisition as much as pipeline acquisitions.”
Which is to say, their workforces were among these companies most valuable assets. This approach, McCarthy noted, requires not only strong due diligence but is really only available to companies big enough to fork out major capital.
This is a sentiment echoed by Kosta Bourandanis, co-founder of industry group Solar Cutters. He told pv magazine Australia that while big companies have been able to cope, smaller companies are struggling and some are even stalling, unable to find enough workers to keep up with demand.
Platinum Solar Designs, a small and exclusively in-house solar company based on the New South Wales south coast, is one such example. “We’re stuck and we’ve been stuck now for about two years,” general manager Scott Mason, who formerly founded and owned Australian Solar Designs, told pv magazine Australia.
It is with the system of Clean Energy Council (CEC) accreditations that Mason sees the real heart of the issue. To be precise, it isn’t so much that Mason is struggling to find staff (though that is also true), but rather that his business can’t keep staff.
The primary reason for this retention issue, he says, is that as soon as young electricians finish their apprenticeships, they can become CEC accredited installers within a matter of days. With this accreditation, they can earn much more money subcontracting for big solar companies like Sunboost and Arise.
Why work for AUD 45 ($32) an hour, Mason said, when it’s possible to earn as much as $1,600 per job installing as a sole trader?
His company now has to watch the amount of sales it makes because it refuses to use subcontractors – a practice Mason believes disables quality control.
“My business cannot grow because I’ve only got a certain amount of [Clean Energy Council] accredited people within my business and at the end of the day, it falls on that number. I can only do so many solar installations a week because I’ve only got so many solar installers that are CEC accredited.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/03/two-battery-energy-storage-trends-for-the-electrification-of-everything/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"MAY 3, 2022",Three battery energy storage trends for the electrification of everything,"Energy storage has been, and will continue to remain, a key tool for those seeking to decarbonize. To meet their sustainability targets, companies and municipalities are turning to cleantech such as renewable energy, electric vehicles (EVs), and green buildings. All of these rely on batteries and other energy storage technologies to ensure their effectiveness and reliability. One key trend in this push towards sustainability is that the energy storage solutions themselves, including batteries, are not immune to questions concerning their environmental footprints.
For example, emissions tied to the footprint of batteries used in an organization’s facilities can be included in the carbon accounting for their operations. In the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, energy storage systems fall under scope 1 and scope 3 emissions.
Accounting for Scope 1 emissions is often easier because much of the data is available within the organization. In contrast, Scope 3 emissions are more difficult to account for because they result from activities from assets neither owned nor controlled by the reporting entity itself. These emissions typically stem from the organization’s supply chain and their assets’ end of life process, which together contributes 65-95% of the company’s carbon emissions. So, if scope 3 emissions are excluded from carbon accounting, the majority of their emissions remain unreported.
Companies that report on their scope 3 emissions stand out from their competitors who lag behind in their disclosure, and can identify and act upon areas for improvement within their supply chain. Leaders in reporting and acting on scope 3 emissions are also better equipped to manage existing and potential regulations.
The demand is growing more urgent for disclosure of scope 3 emissions tied to energy storage systems. For batteries, this disclosure includes data on their GHG, energy, water, and volatile organic compound footprints. Fortunately, up-to-date research now helps users make quantitative comparisons across battery chemistries. In energy-heavy industries such as data centers, where facilities race to showcase their sustainability, this offers a key opportunity to stand out by reducing scope 3 emissions through battery choices.
Energy storage has clearly established its role in the clean energy transition, and the importance of sustainability as a whole is hardly news. But the increase in attention to the environmental footprint of these energy storage technologies is fascinating. Companies and municipalities are no longer able to rely on surface level decisions as they set and meet their climate targets. As the role of storage in decarbonization strategies grows, so does the importance of choosing the most sustainable batteries.
Another reason why battery sustainability has become such a hot topic is the increasing number of different battery options. Gone are the days where a single battery chemistry could consider their foothold on an industry secure. Now, both established and new companies fiercely compete to capitalize on alternative battery technologies’ advantages over the incumbents.
For instance, many data centers once considered lead-acid batteries the standard for meeting their uninterruptible power supply (UPS) needs. Then, lithium-ion batteries’ market entrance triggered a migration as data center operators realized the advantages of lithium’s longer life and lower maintenance needs. Following this disruption, the market became more open to additional chemistries, such as nickel-zinc (NiZn), that provide even more advantages, for example, greater safety, more reliability, and a higher power density that delivers a smaller footprint in a real-estate focused industry.
Of course, change isn’t quick, and many of these alternative chemistries have existed for decades. Incumbent technologies have the advantage of existing infrastructure built with these batteries in mind. Even if a company were to consider swapping out a lead-acid battery for lithium-ion, they would have to address not only the batteries themselves but also the connected systems, which may not be compatible with the replacements.
Fortunately, technological advancements address this obstacle by enabling drop-in replacements for incumbents. UPS solutions include advanced battery cabinets that offer backwards and forwards compatibility with existing UPS infrastructure. With this barrier to battery replacement removed, more data centers can adopt alternative battery chemistries without overhauling their backup power infrastructure.
Alternative battery chemistries are challenging incumbents on a variety of characteristics: safety, sustainability, cost, abuse tolerance, space requirements, and more. As new technologies are tailored to excel in these areas, the energy storage industry grows increasingly competitive – making the customer the ultimate winner.
With the commercialization of alternative batteries, markets are realizing that no single battery chemistry exists that is perfect for every use case. As the concept of a “one size fits all” energy storage solution is retired, organizations can creatively incorporate multiple batteries to best meet their needs. Developers have begun to diversify the types of batteries being used in their operations, taking advantage of each chemistry’s unique strengths.
A key distinguishing factor between different batteries is whether they offer high power density or energy density. If a battery has a high power density, it can release large amounts of energy for a short period of time (also known as a high discharge rate). In contrast, a battery with high energy density may have a moderate to low discharge rate, but can supply this amount of energy for a prolonged period of time.
These separate battery types, with differing power and energy densities, can be used together for the same application in a complementary hybrid approach. Microgrids are being developed that have the option of pulling power from a power battery or energy battery, depending on the circumstance. Such an approach is particularly useful for peak power shaving and EV charging systems.
Peak power shaving is the use of battery storage to supply power to a microgrid when power demand and its ensuing costs are highest. This strategy helps operations save money while maintaining disruption-free microgrid functionality. As the transportation economy electrifies, it increases power supply stress on the grid, which in turn increases the grid’s reliance on battery energy storage. While high energy-density batteries (such as lithium-ion) are well adapted to support long duration power demand, they often are not powerful enough to meet short-term peak power demand. At these times, high-power density batteries like NiZn can respond on demand to support those types of short-term microgrid power requirements.
Another example is the power battery use case for EV charging in environments with fluctuating demand. Most battery-powered EV charging stations can support simultaneous demand for only a few level 2 charge sessions, which are slower than level 3. The increase in demand for high power level 3 charging, and simultaneous level 3 charging of multiple EVs, is driving the need for high power batteries. By incorporating multiple battery chemistry options into a single charging station, the system can adjust between providing longer duration, lower power charging or faster, higher power charging based on the needs of the situation.
The varying demands of an electrified economy now require operations to be smart about the batteries they utilize, identifying the best resources based on specific situations. These hybrid approaches show how different battery chemistries don’t always have to compete; instead, they can complement each other and provide a more effective solution.
These interconnected trends will intensify. The desire for more sustainable batteries has helped spark the exploration of new chemistries that allow developers and users to take hybrid approaches for their operations. These trends stand true across multiple industries as energy storage use becomes even more widespread. As new technologies emerge and compete, these trends can be expected to bolster the sustainability, efficiency, and value of the energy storage industry.

The IEC 61215- and IEC 61730-certified panel features 144 half-cells based on M10 wafers and a 10-busbar design. It has overall dimensions of 2,278 mm × 1,134 mm × 3.0 mm and weighs in at 32.5 kg, with the front and back glass layers measuring 2 mm thick.
The panel can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,500 V and an operating temperature between -40 C and 85 C. It comes with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.349% per degree Celsius and its power tolerance reaches up to 5%, the manufacturer claims.
“Like all Sharp half-cell modules, the NB-JD540 has three small junction boxes instead of just one, each fitted with one bypass diode,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “These junction boxes are transferring less heat to the cells above and in turn boost the longevity of the panels and the overall performance of the system.”
The new product is purportedly resistant under extreme conditions, as it has passed tests for ammonia, salt mist, sand and potential induced degradation (PID) resistance.

Announcing its first-quarter 2022 figures, the manufacturer said the new high for revenue posted during the January-March period, of $655 million, is likely to be topped by an expected $710 million to $740 million for April to June.
That first-quarter 2022 figure included solar business trade worth $608 million, a record for SolarEdge in the segment. The company expects to have generated $660 million to $690 million during the April-June period.
The company shipped 2.13 GWac worth of inverters in the first three months of the 2022, although its net income slipped 19% from the final three months of 2021 to $33.1 million. No explanation was given for the reverse in the press release issued by SolarEdge to announce the results, nor on the investor slide presentation on the company website as pv magazine went to press. But it could reflect the rising materials and shipping costs which have dogged solar manufacturers worldwide, especially as CEO Zvi Lando stated the rise in revenue was driven by business in the United States and 14 European countries.
Gross margin in the company's solar business also slipped, from 34.5% in the first three months of 2021, and 32.8% in October-December 2021, to 30.2% in the first three months of 2022. The figure could retreat again during April-June 2022, with SolarEdge stating it could range from 28% to 31%.
Whatever the explanation for the quarterly changes, they do not appear to have affected the company's bottom line. With SolarEdge raising $651 million on March 17, the cash and bank balances that amounted to $548 million at the end of December 2021 had risen to $979 million by the end of March 2022, the company said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/03/alkaline-polysulfide-air-redox-flow-battery-with-40-efficiency/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 3, 2022",Alkaline polysulfide-air redox flow battery with 40% efficiency,"Researchers at Imperial College London claim to have developed a stable alkaline-based hybrid polysulfide-air (PSA) redox flow battery (RFB) that can reduce “crossover” issues via a new dual-membrane-structured flow cell.
Crossover occurs during charging and recharging, when battery electrolyte components cross the membrane in the battery cell and the redoxmers – redox-active molecules that can store energy in the electrolytes of batteries – migrate to the wrong side of the device. This can cause capacity losses of up to 50%.
The chemistry of the battery is based on the polysulfide redox couple, which is known for its low costs and high energy density. It was chosen by the scientists as it was also used in previous research projects with PSA RFBs, and offered the lowest chemical cost of storage.
The UK group demonstrated the battery using a modular dual-membrane architecture that combined an anion-exchange membrane (AEM) and a cation-exchange membrane (CEM) in each individual cell.
“The dual-membrane design mitigates the crossover of polysulfide and enables the use of commercially available or synthetic polymer ion-exchange membranes (IEMs),” the scientists explained, noting that the design is able reduce membrane resistance and improve peak power density.

The effectiveness of this dual-membrane structure was evaluated in real PSA RFB operations at all full battery cycling. It was found to be successful in mitigating the crossover of polysulfide ions toward the airside half-cell.
“It also prevented high charging over-potentials of the CEM-based single-membrane PSA RFB. As a result, the dual-membrane-structured PSA RFB exhibited both higher voltage efficiency and high energy efficiencies,” the academics said.
The proposed PSA RFB achieved a maximum power density of 5.81 mW cm−2 at 55 C, relying on commercially available electrodes and membranes. The research team described the values as higher than the previous PSA RFB systems utilizing a precious metal catalyst and solid-state electrolyte separator.
The device also showed an average round-trip energy efficiency of 40% at 1 mA cm−2 over 80 cycles. The battery's energy and power costs were estimated at about $2.5/kWh and $1,600/kW and the academics believe there is significant room for further reduction.
The researchers described the battery in “A cost-effective alkaline polysulfide-air redox flow battery enabled by a dual-membrane cell architecture,” which was recently published in Nature Communications. “Future studies should focus on developing better electrodes, especially a highly active and reversible air electrode,” concluded the scientists.

“The solar cell was conceived for use in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), including roof tiles, facades, walls, and thin-film battery integrated perovskite solar cells for the Internet of Things and sensor applications,” researcher Mohammad Khaja Nazeeruddin told pv magazine.
The TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized in a one-step solvothermal method based on the Mannich reaction, which is an organic reaction commonly used to convert a primary or secondary amine and two carbonyl compounds.
“The favorable energy level, high electron mobility and reduced trap densities of the nanoparticles are conducive to rapid interfacial charge transfer at the m-TiO2/perovskite interface combined with a fast inter-grain charge transport between adjacent TiO2 nanoparticles,” the scientists said.
The solar cell was fabricated with an n-i-p structure and architecture consisting of a glass-coated substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), a compact anatase TiO2 layer, a high conductivity TiO2 nanoparticles layer, a film made of perovskite with a composition of Rb0.03Cs0.05MA0.05FA0.90PbI3, a spiro-OMeTAD hole-blocking layer, and a gold (Au) metal contact.
The champion solar cell developed with this structure achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.05%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.12 V, a short-circuit current of 25.35 mA cm–2, and a fill factor of 84.7%. The research team attributed higher-than-usual open-circuit voltage and fill factor to reduced charge recombination and lowered series resistance, respectively.
“Excellent reproducibility is demonstrated by the narrow distribution in the photovoltaic performances,” the scientists said.
The cell was used to build a mini perovskite solar with an active area of 24.63 square centimeters via spin-coating and vacuum quenching. The small panel exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 22.87% and a fill factor of 82.0%.
“Benefiting from its fewer intrinsic defects, the nanoparticles-based small-size device showed long-term operational stability, maintaining 90% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation for 1,400 h,” the scientists said.
For the first time, the team managed to significantly decrease the gap between a small area efficiency and a large area efficiency. This represented the lowest loss in efficiency reported to date when scaling up from cell to module.
The scientists described the solar cell in “Single-crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles for stable and efficient perovskite modules,” which was recently published in Nature Nanotechnology. The research team includes scientists from EPFL, the University of Würzburg, the University of Luxembourg, the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology, North China Electric Power University, and Xi'an Jiaotong University.

FlexSolar, a PV company in Austin, Texas, provides solutions for off-grid, travel, and recreational vehicles. It is known for its foldable solar modules, which can be propped up on the go for electricity supply wherever there is sun.
One such portable product from FlexSolar is its 200 W briefcase, which comes with two modules attached by a hinge, a kickstand to prop up the array, and a handle for easy carrying. Included with the portable modules is a 10 A, 12/24 V solar charge controller, as well as necessary connection cables.
The 200 W panel charges everyday items rated 12 V or below. Users can connect and charge a smartphone, tablet, laptops, cooler, car battery, etc. If charging a 24 V device, the kit may require an MPPT (maximum power point tracking) controller, said FlexSolar.
The monocrystalline modules have a combined output of 200 W, an open-circuit voltage of 22.8 V, and a rated module efficiency of 21.5%. The water-resistant kit is rated to operate between -40 F to 180 F. The product weighs 38.6 lbs, including the junction box, and unfolded it measures 55.2 inches x 36.5 inches x 1.3 inches. The kit comes out to a price per watt of about $1.85.
The charge controller is equipped with an LED display with adjustable modes and parameters, dual USB outputs and overcharge and overload protection for charging batteries. The briefcase features an intelligent chip for automatically identifying connected devices, optimizing output current to supply the fastest possible charging speed.
The product is warranted for two years. FlexSolar also builds a more portable 100 W briefcase, which weighs 23.2 lbs and has the same maximum power voltage as the 200 W model.
Also built by FlexSolar are several models of highly portable modules linked by numerous hinges for high adaptability. The devices are aimed at charging small USB devices and are small enough to be packed in a day backpack on a hike. There are two-module, 10 W models, three-module 15 W models, and 6-module 40 W models with USB and DC charging ports.
And for RV owners, the company sells 100 W and 200 W kits made-ready to be integrated with the vehicle. The kits are compatible with most 12V batteries (Lead-acid, Gel) and portable power stations (Lithium, LiFePO4).

Indian developer ReNew Power has signed agreements to supply close to 2 GW of renewable power, bringing its gross renewables portfolio to 12.1 GW, from 10.2 GW at the beginning of the current calendar year.
It has signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) and Punjab State Power Corp. Ltd. (PSPCL) for around 1.5 GW of utility-scale solar. Agreements have also been signed with multiple corporate buyers for the long-term supply of renewable energy. The new utility-solar projects will be located in the western state of Rajasthan and will supply power at flat tariffs over periods of 25 years.
“Two PPAs of 600 MW and 375 MW are under the SECI Rajasthan IV scheme, where ReNew will supply electricity at INR 2.18 ($0.029)/kWh. The other two PPAs with SECI for 300 MW and 100 MW are under the SECI IX scheme and have a tariff of INR 2.37/kWh. Under the PSPCL PPA of 100 MW, ReNew will supply electricity at INR 2.33/kWh. All the projects are expected to be commissioned by the fourth calendar quarter of 2023,” stated the company.
Long-term corporate PPAs for 491 MW have been signed at tariffs ranging between INR 3.06/kWh to INR 3.95/kWh. The buyers include a large US-based global technology major, Grasim Industries (part of India’s Aditya Birla Group), and Netmagic (a subsidiary of Japan’s NTT Communications).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/03/california-demand-matches-renewables-generation-for-first-time/,"MARKETS,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 3, 2022",California demand matches renewables generation for first time,"From pv magazine USA
According to the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), the US state hit a big milestone in its energy transition on April 29 by achieving 100% renewable energy supplies for a brief period. For about 15 minutes, the state’s energy demand was matched by a 101% supply availability of renewable energy – most of it supplied by solar.
This is a glimpse into the state’s emissions-free future that it envisions, and a huge accomplishment when considering California as a sovereign nation would represent the fifth-largest economy in the world, larger than Germany.
At about 2:45 pm (GMT-7) on Saturday, CAISO reported that 12.4 GW of the 18 GW of demand was supplied by solar. The remainder was picked up by generation from wind, geothermal, and other sources. After 15 minutes of peak solar irradiance, the supply dipped down to about 97% renewable energy. The peak renewable production broke a previous record of 96.4%.
“Twenty years ago no one thought we could get to 100% renewable energy. But bit by bit, bill by bill, and solar panel by solar panel we did it,” said Dan Jacobson, senior advisor to Environment California.
Jacobson and his colleagues watched the CAISO tracker closely, expecting the possibility of the milestone being reached that day. Jacobson was instrumental in the promotion and passing of California’s 2018 SB 100 bill, which mandates 100% emissions-free retail electric sales to end-use customers by 2045.
While environmentalists and solar energy developers are excited by Saturday’s milestone, disappointment is strongly related to recent federal actions that have directly contrasted with stated clean energy procurement goals. Particularly, the antidumping investigation launched by the US Department of Commerce that has pinched off the bulk of the nation’s solar module supply is of concern. 
California Governor Gavin Newsom said in a letter to the Department of Commerce that the tariff inquiry has delayed at least 4.4 GW of solar and energy storage projects. It has led him to reconsider the closure of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear plant, which has a capacity about half the size of the delayed solar pipeline. In the letter, he encouraged the department to “take immediate action to resolve this issue as soon as possible.”
“This Department of Commerce tariff issue is one of the biggest stories in the country,” said Newsom to The New York Times editorial board.
Despite these headwinds, the solar industry is pushing hard to achieve the state’s procurement mandates to decarbonize the grid. The climate-conscious eagerly look ahead to a day when no more carbon is emitted to power the economy.
“California has shown that, for one brief and shining moment, we could do it. Now we need to get our state running on 100% clean energy for the whole day, the whole week, and the whole year. It’s time to move to 100% clean energy, 100% of the time,” said Laura Deehan, executive director of Environment California.

The electricity transmission system operator (TSO), which also supplies power in Germany, is seeking flexibility from energy consumers to free up more grid capacity in the two areas, after being forced to halt new connections last year because of the number of solar projects that have come online.
A statement by Tennet in April said that it had issued a questionnaire to energy consumers asking for details about their ability to supply less electricity to the grid, and draw down less energy from it, at times of stress.
A similar study has already taken place in Zeeland, Tennet said. Further flexibility fact-finding is also planned in Friesland, Flevoland, Utrecht, and Gelderland, ahead of energy market reforms expected from the Dutch competition regulator this year.
Tennet said it will spend more than €2 billion ($2.1 billion) upgrading grid networks over the next decade. It expects the results of the flexibility study in Limburg and Brabant “before the summer,” implying by the start of June.
The electricity TSO said it is also considering use of the “vluchstrook” – which translates as “emergency lane” – to be able to connect more “sustainable projects.”
