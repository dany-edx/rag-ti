The U.K. government released its Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES) for 2020 today, published by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).
The data for total energy generation and consumption last year confirmed plunging fossil fuel generation, and a growing renewables share. Total energy demand, including petroleum fuels for transport, dipped to 1950s-era figures, due to Covid-19 restrictions. Total consumption was down 13%, year-on-year.
In terms of electricity generation, the report highlighted a coal-free period of 67 days from April 10 to June 16, followed by another window of 55 days, to August 12. Coal fell to a 1.8% share of electricity generation while gas peaker plants provided 35.7%.
Growth in renewables outpaced fossil fuels, with the DUKES data showing, since 2010, renewable generation has increased from 6.9% to the current record high.

Solar generation growth has slowed in the U.K., with its share of the renewable mix standing at 28% in 2020. Solar generation grew 4.6% last year, from 2019, largely because of better weather.
Figures from BEIS indicate only 238 MW of solar PV was added during a Covid-19-affected 2020:
A recent survey by BEIS, to understand how to get more solar on rooftops, noted small-and-medium-sized businesses in the U.K. may be forced to pay higher taxes after installing PV. When the issue was raised with survey respondents, it was met with “palpable disbelief and anger.”
The U.K. government commenced a large scale wind down of the solar feed-in tariff (FIT) in 2015.
With 13% of the U.K.'s electricity coming from offshore wind, and 11.1% from onshore turbines, the combined figure reached a record 24.1%, or 75.7 TWh, of U.K. generation in 2020. Capacity increases were said to be modest however favorable wind conditions, including storms in the first quarter, assisted in generation boosts, to notch an increase of 18% compared with the previous year. Offshore wind, in particular, was noted as generating 29% more electricity on a year-on-year basis.
Biogas was the only renewable energy listed as seeing a fall in generation, with the government attributing this to falling extraction rates at landfill gas sites.
Total renewables capacity, including wind and solar, fell to a low of 1 GW-added last year, the lowest amount since 2007 and the slowest growth rate since 2002.
The publication of the latest release of DUKES data comes following the June 30 announcement by the U.K. government that it would bring forward the ban on coal-fired electricity generation by a year, to October 1, 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/29/catl-claims-to-have-made-sodium-ion-batteries-a-commercial-reality/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JULY 29, 2021",CATL claims to have made sodium-ion batteries a commercial reality,"Battery storage is an enabler of the energy transition, especially powerful lithium-ion devices. The devices have their drawbacks, though, as mining practices and the cost of lithium have raised concerns.
Robin Zeng, chairman of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL), a battery manufacturing heavyweight, has presented a solution. The company is commercially launching lithium-free sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries.
The manufacturer says its newest product ticks all the boxes for modern customer requirements. For starters, the battery reportedly shows a high energy density, of 160 Wh/kg. That is a little short of the 200 Wh/kg achieved by the LFP devices CATL ships for Tesla, but Zeng has already suggested the second generation of Na-ion batteries will reach the 200 Wh/kg mark. Modern NMC-811 devices show energy densities more in the region of 300 Wh/kg. 
However, the sodium-ion product is apparently not lagging in its other electrochemical properties, and can reportedly charge to 80% in just 15 minutes, for example. On top of that, comes the fact the battery is said to be working well in low temperatures. At -20 degrees Celsius, the Na-ion device retains 90% of its nameplate capacity, according to its manufacturer. Also, in terms of thermal stability, Chinese company CATL says its new product exceeds national standards.
CATL will use the first generation of the batteries to address the electric vehicle (EV) market and has highlighted key features such as its low-temperature performance, which would render it suitable for automotive markets with severe winters. CATL will initially roll out battery packs for EVs that combine sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries, to compensate for the shortage of energy density. To achieve this, CATL has also developed a battery management system. 
“The lower energy of the sodium-ion cells suggests that the technology may be more suited for stationary energy storage applications, which are less restrictive, while the unveiling of battery packs combining both sodium-ion and lithium-ion cells could point towards compromise in performance for low-cost electric vehicles, with the potential to disrupt the mass market,” said Wood Mackenzie research analyst Max Reid. 
Sodium-ion batteries have a similar working principle to lithium-ion devices. In both, the ion travels between anode and cathode, dropping or absorbing electrons. Though lithium is very good at this, it is also scarce as a raw material, with most of its production concentrated in Chile, Australia, and China. 
Not only is the lithium market volatile, due to geographical concentration of the metal, but its extraction is also under fire for its intensive water use and other aspects of its environmental footprint. Sodium-ion batteries have been suggested as a lithium-free alternative.
As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
Wood Mackenzie sees the arrival of sodium-ion devices as offering the potential to relax supply constraints in battery raw materials. “About 93% of CATL's cell capacity is located in China,” said senior analyst Le Xu. “Developing sodium-ion battery technology could diversify their raw materials consumption, especially [of] lithium. Battery suppliers such as CATL, Tesla, [and] LG Chem have proactively signed supply agreements with miners in Australia and Chile which pushed lithium chemicals spot prices to a new high in the past six months.”
Sodium is one of the most abundantly available elements in the earth's crust and can be mined by performing electrolysis on sodium-chloride (table salt), for example. It can also be found in other chemical connections. 
The challenge with sodium-ion batteries, has been the larger volume of sodium ions required, compared to lithium ions. To accommodate the extra ions, particular requirements regarding the material's structural stability and kinetic properties have to be considered and attempts to date have resulted in capacity fading rapidly in Na-ion devices. 
To meet the challenge, CATL said it used Prussian white material with a higher specific capacity. The material NaxFe[Fe(CN)6]y·nH2O has been considered a potential cathode candidate for Na-ion batteries by other research teams, too, but practical limitations relating to capacity and cycling stability had inhibited a commercial breakthrough. CATL said it has solved the problem by redesigning the bulk structure of the material and rearranging the electrons. On the anode side, CATL has also developed a novel carbon-based material, the highly porous structure of which enables the storage of sodium ions, ensuring cycle performance. 
“Sodium-ion technology has long been touted for commercial battery use due to sodium's low cost and high abundance, relative to lithium, and CATL producing large scale sodium-ion batteries shows the technology's appeal is coming to fruition sooner rather than later,” said WoodMac's Reid. 
With an eye on production costs, Qisen Huang, deputy dean of the CATL Research Institute, said sodium-ion battery manufacturing would be highly compatible with currently-used production methods and equipment. CATL has started industrial production of the devices and wants to stabilize the industrial chain for such products by 2023. Doing so will require a joint effort by upstream suppliers and downstream consumers, CATL noted, and it has invited the two groups, and research institutes, to join forces to drive deployment of the product.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/29/meyer-burger-plans-to-launch-solar-pv-roof-tiles-in-2022/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JULY 29, 2021",Meyer Burger plans to launch solar PV roof tiles in 2022,"From pv magazine Germany.
The first heterojunction Smartwire solar modules have just come off Meyer Burger’s production line in Germany’s Saxony, and the Swiss company is already planning its next step.
It announced Thursday that it plans to add innovative solar PV roof tiles to its portfolio. The product will be a roof-integrated, high-performance PV system that can be installed like traditional roof tiles.
To accelerate the market launch, Meyer Burger has acquired a highly developed solution from an unnamed German engineering service provider that has already been certified and approved by the German building authorities, in accordance with IEC 61215 and IEC 61730.
The purchase agreement includes all intellectual property rights to the PV roof tile solution, including all associated patents, certifications, and building authority approval, as well as technical knowhow, said Meyer Burger. The parties agreed not to disclose the purchase price.
The roof-integrated solar PV system will expand Meyer Burger's portfolio in the premium rooftop segment. The manufacturer plans to present its solar roof at Intersolar Europe in Munich at the beginning of October.
Meanwhile, first deliveries of the PV tiles to customers are scheduled for the second half of 2022, according to the company. They will be designed in such a way that they can be easily installed and maintained by a roofer, it added.
“Integrated solar roof systems still represent a market niche today,” said Gunter Erfurt, CEO of Meyer Burger. “With our novel solar tile solution, we plan to take roof-integrated solutions out of the niche and into a larger market.”
Moreover, expanding the portfolio in this direction is a “consistent step within our growth strategy,” Erfurt added. With the integrated roof system, it will also be possible, in the future, to develop roof areas that are not suitable for the installation of standard PV modules.
The company added that it also intends to rely on its heterojunction smartwire technology for the tiles.
To date, Meyer Burger's most prominent competitor in the PV tile market is probably Tesla. The CEO of the Californian electric car manufacturer, Elon Musk, presented his vision of a solar tile for the “solar roof” back in the autumn of 2016.
Since then, he has remained rather quiet again about the solution and it is relatively unclear how many roofs are equipped with Tesla’s PV tiles. There are also several other suppliers on the market, such as Autarq, Sunroof, and Midsummer.

The off-grid solar company, which is present in numerous African nations where customers pay for the electricity they consume from its solar home systems (SHS'), yesterday announced it would enter the Sahel nation via a joint venture with French cotton company Geocoton Advens Group.
Bboxx, which has French energy giants Engie and EDF among its significant backers, said the 350,000-strong network of cotton traders managed by Geocoton across West and Central Africa would offer a foothold in Burkina Faso which would enable the London-based company to expand operations beyond the cotton farms.
The former start-up said Geocoton's network would enable it to offer solar electricity even in the eastern and northeastern parts of Burkina Faso afflicted by violence between islamic militants and government-backed militias.
A statement on Bboxx' website yesterday indicated the company would initially offer customers its SHS units, before expanding into liquefied petroleum gas clean cooking and solar-powered water pumps for farmers.
The company, whose customers pay for the electricity they consume on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) basis via their mobile phones, has been successful in attracting millions in investment from impact investors include Luxembourg-based Bamboo Capital Partners, Netherlands entity DOEN and Canadian fund MacKinnon, Bennett and Company. It has worked with Dutch cooperative Oikocredit to securitize its SHS business into an asset class and has previously stated an ambition of becoming a full-scale PAYG private utility.

No mention was made of any use of carbon capture and storage technology to mitigate the carbon emissions associated with the production of hydrogen feedstock liquid ammonia from natural gas.
With the company, whose shares are still suspended from trading on the exchange in the absence of signed-off figures for 2020, having claimed to have sold off 5.6 GW of its solar project portfolio to “restore the liabilities of the company to a healthier level,” GCL said it would work with its connected Poly-GCL Petroleum Group Holdings Ltd energy business to source the natural gas to be used for hydrogen production.
The poly maker said it had signed two strategic co-operation agreements to raise funds for hydrogen investment.
State-owned JIC Capital Management Ltd will be tasked with fundraising RMB10 billion (US$1.54 billion) for a hydrogen energy industry investment fund which GCL said it would assist “in preparing and implementing.”
A separate cash pot of up to US$800 million would be established with the help of state-owned CCB International Asset Management Ltd, which will act as general partner, with GCL as one of the fund's limited partners.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/29/spark-welcomes-takeover-talks-as-buyout-bid-reaches-almost-us4b/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 29, 2021",Spark welcomes takeover talks as buyout bid reaches almost $4bn,"From pv magazine Australia
Spark Infrastructure has told shareholders it is in the company’s interest to engage in talks after a consortium including United States-based private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co delivered a third buyout offer which values the company at $5.2 billion (US$3.85 billion).
The consortium, which also includes Canada’s Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, revealed its new, higher offer of $2.95 (USD$2.18) per security on Wednesday.
Spark, which owns a 49% stake in Victorian distribution operators Powercor and CitiPower, 49% of South Australia’s distribution network operator SA Power Networks, and a 15% stake in transmission network operator Transgrid in New South Wales, had previously knocked back two acquisition proposals from the consortium.
Spark said those bids – the initial $2.6375 and the follow up $2.7375 (in local currency) – undervalued the company but left the door open for an improved offer and provided the consortium with “limited information” on its business and its prospects.
The consortium has now provided a third offer that represents a 26% premium on the closing price of $2.30 on July 13, the day before the first bid was received.
In an ASX announcement on Wednesday, Spark told shareholders it is in the company’s interest to continue to talk with the consortium and granted its suitors access to its books.
“Following careful consideration, and consultation with its advisers, the board of Spark Infrastructure considers that it is in the interests of Spark Infrastructure’s securityholders to engage further with the consortium,” Spark said in the statement.
“Accordingly, Spark Infrastructure has decided to provide the consortium with the opportunity to conduct due diligence on a non-exclusive basis.”
While Spark said it will engage further with the North American consortium, and allow it to complete the necessary due diligence, the company also made it clear that it was open to other approaches if this one failed.
“The board notes that there is no certainty that the engagement between Spark Infrastructure and the consortium will result in a control transaction,” Spark said in the ASX statement.
“The board remains focused on maximising securityholder value and will carefully consider any proposal that is consistent with this objective.
“Irrespective of whether the engagement between Spark Infrastructure and the consortium results in a control transaction, the board considers that Spark Infrastructure has a high quality and scarce group of regulated assets that have a very attractive future and is well positioned to continue to deliver an attractive yield now with franking credits.
“Complementing its reliable and inflation-linked revenues, Spark Infrastructure’s investment portfolio also has strong growth prospects in its underlying high-quality asset base and has strong ESG credentials given its important role in supporting the multi- decade energy transition to a lower carbon future.”
Until recently Spark was exclusively an investor in regulated network infrastructure but it has begun developing a portfolio of wind, solar and storage assets, targeting more than $1 billion of investment in renewable energy generation by 2025.
Earlier this month it announced plans to develop a 2.5 GW hybrid wind, solar PV and battery storage project in New South Wales while the 100 MW Bomen Solar Farm came online last year.
The company has also revealed it has plans to construct a 60 MW extension at the Bomen Solar Farm as well as a yet to be identified 150 MW solar+storage project and a 350 MW wind farm in NSW along with a massive 600 MW wind farm project in South Australia.
