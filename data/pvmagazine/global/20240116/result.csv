The finance package, which represents the largest green loan raised in Europe to date, comes from a group of 23 commercial banks, alongside the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Nordic Investment Bank (NIB). It brings the total amount of debt and equity raised by the company to $13 billion.
“This financing is a milestone for the European energy transition. It will enable us to realize the full potential of Northvolt Ett and demonstrates that circular, sustainable business practices are fundamental to success in today’s industry,” Peter Carlsson, co-founder and CEO of Northvolt.
In addition to the expansion of Northvolt Ett’s cathode production and cell manufacturing, the financing package will enable the expansion of the adjacent recycling plant, Revolt Ett, which is approaching the conclusion of its commissioning and is processing its first materials.
“The facility recovers battery-grade metals with a carbon footprint 70% lower than mined raw materials, thereby enabling a fully integrated, circular battery production setup that has not previously existed outside of Asia,” the company said in an announcement this week.
Northvolt claims to be building the world’s greenest lithium-ion batteries with a minimal CO2 footprint. The company has managed to reduce its lithium-ion cell carbon footprint to 33 kg CO2/kWh — a two-thirds reduction compared to an industry reference. Its goal, however, is to establish 150 GWh of annual cell production by 2030 at 10 kg CO2/kWh with 50% of material for its lithium-ion cells coming from recycling.
Established in 2016, Northvolt has quickly become Europe’s best funded climate tech start-up, having secured the backing of big investors such as Volkswagen, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs. Only last week, the company secured EU approval for EUR 902 million ($982 million) in German state aid to build an electric vehicle battery production plant in the north of Germany.
The new debt deal includes refinancing of a $1.6 billion debt package raised in July 2020, and has been raised on the back of long-term offtake contracts amounting to more than $55 billion, said the battery maker.
Through its financial implementing partners – the EIB and the NIB, the InvestEU program supports EUR 392 million investment in Europe’s first circular gigafactory. The program provides the EU with long-term funding by leveraging private and public funds in support of EU policy priorities.
“We mean business when it comes to Europe's battery industry,” Commission Executive Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič in charge of the European Green Deal and the European Battery Alliance said. “It is of strategic importance and a key battleground for global competitiveness. Northvolt, our battery pioneer, showcases that the EU has what it takes to build an innovative, sustainable, and globally competitive battery ecosystem.”
Šefčovič said that he is proud Northvolt's success story, as well as of other 160 industrial projects taking shape across the entire value chain, while promoted under the European Battery Alliance.
“The EIB's role is indispensable,” he added. “We need to be strategic, bold, agile.”
In December 2021, Northvolt bacame the first manufacturer to produce battery cells fully designed, developed and assembled by a homegrown European battery company. Those first cells rolled off its manufacturing lines at Northvolt Ett, which has an installed capacity of 16 GWh. In the meantime, the company has revealed plans for three more plants in Germany, Canada and Sweden.

The proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer is the first for Amazon and is producing hydrogen to fuel more than 225 hydrogen fuel cell-powered forklift trucks at the site. The hydrogen will be compressed on site and will be stored in a gaseous hydrogen storage tank. Plug Power has collaborated with Amazon to deploy more than 17,000 fuel cells to replace batteries in forklifts in more than 80 fulfilment centers in North America. “For most of these locations, hydrogen to power the forklifts is produced elsewhere, liquified, and delivered by trucks to an on-site storage and dispensing system,” said Plug Power.
The US government has announced $623 million in grants to build electric-vehicle (EV) charging networks and hydrogen fueling infrastructure in urban and rural communities across the United States. In particular, it will allocate $70 million to build up to five hydrogen fueling stations for medium- and heavy-duty freight trucks in Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio. “The project will help create a hydrogen corridor from southern California to Texas,” said the US Department of Transportation. 
Hexagon Purus has raised approximately NOK 1 billion ($95.7 million) from strategic investors Mitsui and Hy24. “The proceeds will support Hexagon Purus's growth strategy, including its ongoing global capacity expansion program,” said the Norwegian company. The five new production facilities are in the US state of Maryland, the Canadian province of British Columbia, Germany, and China. In addition, the company plans to open a new site in Dallas, Texas, in 2024.
H2 Energy Europe has secured environmental approval for a large-scale green hydrogen production facility in Esbjerg, Denmark. “This achievement marks a significant milestone for the project, bringing it closer to a Final Investment Decision (FID),” said the Zürich-based company, explaining that the pipeline is set for completion by 2028. According to Jesper Frost Rasmussen, the mayor of Esbjerg municipality, the development sends a message to green energy companies, demonstrating that private investors can secure approvals for their projects and are prepared to start construction of large-scale hydrogen facilities. The facility will produce surplus heat, which has the potential to supply the majority of households in Esbjerg with district heating.
ArcelorMittal Bremen and energy service provider EWE have signed a letter of intent to jointly develop hydrogen production projects for green steel manufacturing. In April 2023, ArcelorMittal Bremen, EWE, and a subsidiary of EWE, SWB, started working on a 10 MW hydrogen production plant in Bremen, Germany, which is due to go into operation this year. “We want to use hydrogen instead of coal as a chemical reducing agent and thus further reduce CO2 emissions towards net zero,” said Frank Hohlweg, chief operating officer for ArcelorMittal Bremen. “Until green hydrogen is available in sufficient quantities and at competitive prices, we are planning to use natural gas in the transition phase.”
The German state of Saxony and the Czech Republic have signed a letter of intent to cooperate on the development of a hydrogen infrastructure and the use of hydrogen. “The plans include the establishment of a cross-border hydrogen network and the promotion of cooperation and exchange between German and Czech research institutions and companies,” said the government of Saxony. The two countries have agreed to convert existing natural gas pipelines to hydrogen. “This should ensure the supply of large quantities of hydrogen from Eastern and Southern Europe at low cost by 2029, if possible.” Poland, as an important trading partner, is likely to engage in new hydrogen projects with Germany, given the Polish government's new green approach, said Saxony Economics and Transport Minister Martin Dulig.
The Ukrainian government has presented its 2050 Hydrogen Strategy, saying that the move brings the country closer to European energy transition goals. The document includes pilot ideas for the production of renewable hydrogen. “The project was prepared by the experts of the Reform Support Office under the Ministry of Energy with the assistance of the Reform Architecture Fund in Ukraine (ARU Fund), which is financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD),” said the Ukrainian government.

The organization's experts considered the cost of ownership (CoO) for the production of TOPCon, heterojunction (HJT) and tunnel back contact (TBC) modules. Its assumptions were based on the idea of module manufacturing at a 10 GW integrated PV factory.
“For different PV technologies, we see that there is little difference in the cost of ownership from one technology to another (up to 8,4% between HJT and passivated emitter and rear contact, or PERC), and can largely be explained by different raw materials requirements, notably silver, and different cell production processes for innovative technologies,” the analysts said in their white paper, “PV Manufacturing in Europe: Ensuring resilience through industrial policy.”
For the TOPCon technology, production prices in China might currently range between $0.160/W to $0.189/W. In Europe, prices are likely between $0.243/W and $0.300/W. India and the United States likely have production costs of $0.195/W and $0.281/W, respectively.
According to the report, Chinese manufacturers could currently produce heterojunction panels for between $0.173/W to $0.198/W. The price range for potential European module makers is indicated at between $0.250/W and $0.305/W. Indian and US producers, meanwhile, should achieve prices of $0.209/W and $0.290/W, respectively.
As for TBC technology, ETIP PV said Chinese companies could now produce panels for between $0.162/W and $0.190/W, with the European manufacturers being able to achieve a price range of $0.245/W to $0.303/W. Indian and US manufacturers could likely produce for $0.197/W and $0.284/W, respectively.
Cost variation
The researchers said that price differences between the analyzed regions mainly depend on material and labor costs, as well as equipment and building depreciation costs.
“Material cost differences can represent up to 30% premium, which results from shipment, economies of scale and import taxes in certain countries,” they said. “Labor cost can vary by a factor of eight, while the electricity costs in Europe or the USA can be up to five times higher compared to China.”
They also said that production equipment costs could be 40% higher for Western companies, as these include import duties. “Building costs for a manufacturing plant are around two times higher in Western markets compared to China,” they said.
ETIP PV also provided a summary in its report of all incentive schemes for solar manufacturing in the analyzed regions.

Image: Lightstar Renewables
Having recently attended the second annual AgriVoltaics Europe conference, in Amsterdam, I am realizing that the United States has run through enough brick walls with regards to agrivoltaics in the last three years to almost be caught up with Europe, at least in terms of policy.
The United States has responded tremendously to agrivoltaics in recent years. There is now a 1.3 GW agrivoltaic array in northern Indiana, in New York state, which will deliver its first specialty crop array in 2024 and the Shines program, in Illinois, has more than 50 projects which are choosing to include agricultural production within half of their arrays. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) says that there is nearly 6 GW of agrivoltaic generation capacity operating in the United States, ranging from solar panels on grazing pasture to crop fields. In Amsterdam I was unable to get a concrete answer about how many megawatts of agrivoltaic capacity there is in Europe and the United Kingdom, so kudos is due to the NREL for aggregating the data at a national scale for the United States.
I would expect the small-scale, “distributed generation” programs in Illinois, New Jersey, and Maryland alone to increase their generation capacity by a gigawatt over the next 18 months and there are many more gigawatts in the pipeline at the utility scale.
In Europe, there may be more specialty-crop and commodity-crop installations but countries in the European Union are still struggling along without an overarching definition of agrivoltaics. This is leaving nations to develop their own definitions and to do more work than necessary to develop technical specifications. The United States is in a similar spot but has an opportunity to clarify the definition of agrivoltaics at the federal level through the cross-party Baldwin-Grassley Protecting the Future of Farmland Act. At Lightstar, we are hopeful that a definition of agrivoltaics will be included in the 2023/24 Farm Bill. A definition would supercharge the agrivoltaics market in the United States and streamline many questions that remain at a local level.
Europe is dealing with an increasing energy cost burden and there is a similar position in the United States because both markets still rely on a natural gas supply that is deeply vulnerable to political and economic unrest. One remark that stood out at the AgriVoltaics Europe conference was, “the end of incentives for solar in Europe is here.” That reality is driving more off-the-shelf racking to be deployed and such projects don’t look dissimilar to many configurations already used in the US utility and distributed-generation markets. I was consistently told by attendees in Amsterdam that the opportunity to scale agrivoltaics further lies in momentum, in the United States, for using two-in-portrait solar panel configurations, although, Italy did just approve €1.7 billion ($1.84 billion) in incentives for agrivoltaics.
That will go a long way because Italy maintains flexible design standards and will award incentives to projects that are a minimum of 6 ft 8 in off the ground. The height of two-in-portrait arrays in the United States is typically at least seven feet. Italy is incentivizing smart solar design without increasing materials costs dramatically.
Obviously the United States has more farmland than Europe but the fact remains that each US state is land constrained because of the finite amount of electric grid interconnection capacity and productive farmland.
It was also incredibly helpful to see large European energy companies such as RWE and EDF doing distributed-generation projects in northern Europe – that region has the same solar yield as the middle of Quebec. With our more generous solar yields, south of Canada, we know that we can grow food and produce solar at the same time. In fact, we can do it at scale. That is, provided the industry and local decision makers have sufficient courage.
The United States has utilized the last 15 years of research built up in Europe to correctly size agrivoltaics for the United States market. In my final presentation at the conference in Amsterdam, I joked that Europe may have started it but we’ll do it faster – and bigger. That’s the American way.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/16/red-sea-tensions-set-to-drive-up-solar-module-prices/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JANUARY 16, 2024",Red Sea tensions set to drive up solar module prices,"From pv magazine Germany
The prices of solar modules in all technological classes were lowered slightly again at the end of 2023. This is probably the last time this will happen over the long term and only affects in-stock items already in Europe.
PV modules that first have to be shipped or are still traveling by sea are already being offered by many suppliers at prices that are between €0.01 ($0.01)/W and €0.02/W higher. The reason is ongoing tensions in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Houthi militants have been attacking merchant ships there for weeks, preventing them from entering the Red Sea and transiting through the Suez Canal. Many shipping companies will avoid the region – the key trade route between Europe and Asia – until the conflict, which is related to the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, is resolved.
The alternative route circles the southern tip of Africa and is about 6,000 kilometers longer. The costs of transporting a container from China to Rotterdam have already almost tripled. The fact that module prices have not risen further is only due to the fact that demand remains somewhat contained at the moment.
In Germany and central and northern Europe, lower demand is mainly due to the ongoing cold wave and the uncertain political situation in some countries. In Poland, for example, the newly elected government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk has not yet become operational due to continuous interruptions and protests by members and supporters of the old government. 
If we look back at the forecasts for 2023, expectations for a drop in PV component prices starting in the second half of the year have been fulfilled. In the case of modules, the price decline has been even faster and more severe than even experts could have imagined. Thanks to the fall in the costs of PV installations, high installation figures were also achieved in the second half, especially in the small installations sector in Germany, although demand had decreased significantly compared to the previous year.
At least in the first three quarters, the backlog that still existed for many installers was cleared. Overall, construction of new PV capacity in Germany increased by almost 100%, from 7.5 GW to more than 14 GW.
Meanwhile, the long-awaited reduction in bureaucracy announced by German politicians, especially for the construction of larger PV parks, has not yet materialized, which has somewhat slowed down new construction in the commercial and utility sectors. The rapid drop in module prices has also caused a wait-and-see attitude, and the completion of some projects has been postponed to the future. There is currently little talk of a bottleneck in the installation market, but old problems could resurface at the end of the year, as soon as the market recovers.
Many offers from last year currently have to be adjusted downwards, as PV components have become cheaper and competition has intensified. Even for small- and medium-sized complete installations, not all excessively high prices should be accepted uncritically and without negotiating the price.
The improvements in favor of an accelerated expansion of renewable energies that the ruling coalition government has long expected in Germany are summarized in the so-called “Solarpaket 1,” which should have been approved at the end of 2023. However, it was postponed until the current year due to the budget debate, with the exception of three new regulations that mainly affect wind energy.
If the amendments to the law as presented are approved at the end of January, capacity will increase. The regulations provide for the granting of the right to lay cables (landowners must grant operators of renewable energy systems a right of way if necessary to be able to lay a connection cable from the system to the connection point to the network), priority will be given to the construction of ground-mounted systems in disadvantaged areas, so that less high-quality arable land has to be used. The category “special solar installations” will include floating PV, photovoltaics on wasteland sites, parking lots, agricultural photovoltaics. Repowering for self-consumption on rooftops will be allowed beyond technical defects or damage to the modules.
With component prices currently at historic lows, this opens up considerable additional sales potential for suppliers.

A study conducted at the University of Western Ontario compared both large and small solar installations and concluded that small-scale solar systems are better for the environment than even the largest, most efficient, utility-scale solar projects.
Solar is scaling up in the United States and Canada in part because solar energy is the lowest-cost form of new-build electricity in  many markets, according to an energy and resources report by Ernst & Young. It notes that the global weighted average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar is 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel alternative.
To eliminate carbon emissions and meet national clean energy goals, many more solar panels must be installed. A study that looked at the agrivoltaic potential in Canada predicted that it would need only 1% of the nation's agricultural land to offset all fossil fuels for electricity generation. While this is a modest amount of land, the researchers at University of Western Ontario questioned whether it is better for the environment to have a few large-scale solar farms or many smaller rooftop systems.
The lifecycle analysis study conducted by Riya Roy and Joshua M. Pearce compared rooftop solar systems to multi-megawatt utility-scale solar PV systems, from production to decommissioning. The researchers found that rooftop solar systems require 21% to 54% less input energy, make 18% to 59% less carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gas emissions, and consume a lower quantity of water, ranging from 1% to 12% per kilowatt-peak.

NETRA, the R&D unit of Indian integrated power utility NTPC, has demonstrated hydrogen cooking with hydrogen from a green hydrogen plant at its campus in Greater Noida, India.
“Burning characteristics of hydrogen are much different from LPG or PNG wrt flame color (almost invisible), flame temperature (1,200 C to 1,500 C), flame propagation speed,” said NETRA. “Also, unlike LPG or PNG, hydrogen cannot be premixed with air before its ignition – or else it would form an explosive mixture.”
NETRA designed a hydrogen burner for a modified cookstove. It said that the emissions consisted solely of water vapor, with no carbonaceous elements.
NTPC has successfully commissioned a blending project that incorporates green hydrogen with piped natural gas in Kawas, Gujarat. A green hydrogen mobility project is also set to be commissioned, in addition to another project for green hydrogen-based microgrids in remote locations.

The company describes the process as “simple and effective” across a wide range of perovskite compositions, device structures and areas.
“We developed the aerosol-assisted solvent treatment in the lab using a reactor with 2.5 cm x 7.5 cm. We are scaling it to 23 cm x 23 cm, to accommodate up to the M12 wafer size,” Aerosolar, founder, Joe Briscoe, told pv magazine.“The business model is to begin with consulting and design of bespoke equipment, potentially progressing to manufacturing standardized equipment.”
The company plans to apply its process in both batch-based and roll-to-roll processing, working with perovskite solar cell manufacturers who want to implement the process step. It recently received a tech transfer grant from Innovate UK, the UK's national innovation agency.
The technology was originally tested with a dimethylformamide (DMF) solution alone or with added methylammonium chloride (MACI), which enhances the grain growth of perovskite cells, reducing local defects and improving overall uniformity.
Compared to direct thermal annealing, the novel technique reportedly enables processing at lower temperatures. Aerosolar said it supports improved crystallinity and grain size, accompanied by a narrowing in grain size distribution. Also notable is that throughout the aerosol treatment, the films remain solid, and there is no dissolution of the perovskite film, with the process taking less than five minutes.
The seasonal, December and January edition of pv magazine reveals the much-anticipated winners of this year’s pv magazine Awards. We also consider the ramifications of the current global oversupply of solar panels, Australia’s prospects of refining battery raw materials, and examine how the European Union’s green hydrogen ambitions are developing.
Aerosol is targeting manufacturers of perovskite solar cells with its new solvent process. It was described in the study “Aerosol Assisted Solvent Treatment: A Universal Method for Performance and Stability Enhancements in Perovskite Solar Cells,” in Advanced Energy Materials.

Australia's Gridcog has revealed that solar fences – effectively, bifacial panels oriented east and west at 90-degree tilt angles – demonstrate promising yield and revenue potential, based on simulations comparing a vertical install to a typical ground-mount solar system.
Gridcog, which provides software to plan, track and optimize distributed energy projects, created two scenarios in the simulation: one using conventional solar and one using a solar fence configuration. It then modeled sites in London and Sydney against both scenarios and ran a one-year model against typical irradiance data for each location.
The conventional solar utilised 100 kW (DC)/100 kW (AC) systems for both sites using monofacial panels. London was oriented 180 degrees south and Sydney at 0 degrees north, both with a tilt of 40 degrees.
The solar fence scenario comprised 100 kW (DC)/100 kW (AC) of bifacial panels. The systems were oriented 90 degrees east/180 degrees west at a tilt of 90 degrees, perpendicular to the ground.

“Unlike most air-to-air heat pumps, it was developed for areas with harsh winters,” the company said in a statement. “Traditionally, air-source heat pumps have the advantage of being relatively affordable and easy to install, and like all heat pumps they can cool as well as heat. They have the disadvantage, however, of not working very well in extremely cold temperatures.
The #Bosch IDS Ultra Heat Pump, was developed for North America and it‘s operational down to temperatures of 5 degrees Fahrenheit – an attractive option for people in colder climates looking to switch from fossil fuel-based heating systems. #BoschCES https://t.co/7CQZIcXK26

According to the manufacturer, the new Inverter Ducted Split (IDS) Ultra heat pump can provide 100% heating capacity at an outdoor temperature of -15 C and can operate down to – 25 C.
The system utilizes an inverter that reportedly adjusts the speed of the compressor to optimize comfort and sound levels to a minimum.
“The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) confirmed that Bosch’s cold climate heat pump meets the requirements to progress from lab to field testing as part of the Residential Cold Climate Heat Pump Technology Challenge,” Bosch said, without providing further technical details on the new product.
The IDS Ultra Heat Pump belongs to Bosch's Inverter Ducted Split (IDS) Heat Pump series, which includes four other products – the IDS Light, the IDS Plus, the IDS Premium, and the IDS Premium Connected.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/16/das-solar-claims-record-open-circuit-voltage-of-742-mv-for-n-type-solar-cell/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 16, 2024",Das Solar claims record open-circuit voltage of 742 mV for n-type solar cell,"China’s DAS Solar says it has achieved a world record open-circuit voltage of 742 mV for an n-type solar cell based on tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cell technology, with a power conversion efficiency of 26.33%.
China’s National PV Industry Measurement and Testing Center (NPVM) has confirmed the result.
“This achievement sets a record for the highest open-circuit voltage of crystalline silicon homojunction solar cells,” the company said in a statement. The previous world record of 735 mV had been reported by Das Solar in December.
The cell has an area of 333.4 cm2 and is based on passivating contacts based on polysilicon and silicon monoxide (SiOx), which reportedly reduce carrier recombination at the metal/silicon interface, thus improving short-circuit current and fill factor.
“DAS Solar's R&D team has consistently improved the open-circuit voltage of TOPCon cells, progressing from 701 mV with TOPCon1.0 to 742 mV with TOPCon4.0 Plus. A perfect passivation structure in the cell underpins its ability to achieve high open-circuit voltage. The TOPCon technology is expected to progress towards its theoretical limit of 28.7% in the near future.” said DAS Solar CTO, Song Dengyuan.
Das Solar is based in headquartered in Quzhou City, Zhejiang province, and currently has an annual TOPCon solar module capacity of 30 GW. Its two largest shareholders are China Huaneng Group and China Merchants Group.
