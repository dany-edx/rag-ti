Cold temperatures can reduce battery performance, but it remains unclear how batteries will fare in extreme space conditions. This is why JAXA called for research proposals in 2016 and chose to cooperate with Hitachi Zosen to develop a solid-state battery that can operate in space.
JAXA will send the solid-state battery to the ISS and attach it the IVA-replaceable Small Exposed Experiment Platform (i-SEEP) on the outside of the “Kibo” Japanese research module. The team will conduct tests for six months to gain conclusive data on the performance of the solid-state battery.
JAXA will use 140 mAh batteries for the test. They will be connected with 15 cells to create a 2.1 Ah power supply. If successful, the batteries will be a lot easier to handle in space, because they won't need thick temperature protection shields. This could help to miniaturize and lighten battery designs.
In addition, the batteries won't require heating, which could improve the power consumption of battery-powered equipment in space. The team hopes to eventually use the technology to power Lunar and Mars rovers, as well as observation equipment.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/08/reusing-pv-modules-pose-opportunities-and-challenges/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",EDGAR MEZA,"MARCH 8, 2021",Reusing PV modules poses opportunities and challenges,"With photovoltaics playing an ever growing role in renewable energy generation, the efficient reuse and repair of PV modules is becoming increasingly desirable, particularly in low-income countries. According to a new study, however, unclear legislation and weak international electronic waste guidelines are hampering their efficient repurposing.
In their exploratory report on the sector, Belgian non-profit organization PV Cycle and European innovation hub Imec/EnergyVille detail the current practices, risks and challenges of the reemployment market in order to inform concerned authorities and stakeholders, and to formulate initial recommendations. They point out that in the circular economy approach, reuse and repair actions play an essential role in extending the useful life of PV modules by preventing their early entry into the waste stream, according to the report.
A reemployment market exploiting the first wave of dismantling is emerging 15 years after the beginning of the initial boom in PV installations. As a nascent industry, however, PV module reuse is a sector in which companies operate “in an unexplored and mostly unregulated area,” the report finds, adding: “Industrial and public players in PV and/or waste management have little or no knowledge of its operations.
PV Cycle and Imec/EnergyVille note that PV has rapidly become one of the most economic energy generation technologies. “The price of electricity generated by PV has reached a levelized cost of electricity of 5-10 €c/kWh, leading to a major acceleration of its deployment with over 110 GWp of newly installed capacity in 2019 alone,” the study states. Cumulative installed PV capacity is now 627 GWp and it is expected to reach over 1 TWp by 2025.
With crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV modules representing 95 % of the PV market and the terawatt era of PV modules fast approaching, important questions are being raised about end-of-life management as 5 million tons of PV waste by 2030 is projected by IRENA.
“Embracing a circular economic model for this maturing industry brings a major opportunity to make sure that PV becomes one of the most sustainable sources of energy,” the study stresses.
Some 15 companies are currently active in the PV reuse sector, a market estimated at between 500 and 600 MWp per year. “The volume traded is very difficult to estimate as neither PV site decommissioning nor PV resell markets are registered,” the report states.
PV modules represent approximately 40% of the total PV system costs, which motivates the reuse business case. However, the continued rapid decrease of PV modules prices (now down to 0.2-0.3 €/Wp) and rapid increase of PV module efficiencies (now in the range of 17 to 21%), raise questions about the economic viability of the sector.
Second-hand PV modules with lower performance and lifetime expectations but with higher financial risks are mostly in demand in low-income markets, such as countries in Africa, Western Asia and Southeast Asia, where customers seek extreme low-cost PV systems with less quality and aesthetic requirements. A rather small and temporary market of around 10 MWp still exists in western Europe where feed-in tariff regulations often require “very similar” replacement modules in case of damage.
“Overall, reused or repaired PV modules are not competitive for new residential, commercial and utility-scale PV installations in high-income countries or even in developing countries with government incentives to deploy PV,” the study stresses.
Currently, PV modules for reuse are mainly sourced from large commercial PV systems of 10 kWp to MWp in capacity or from large-scale PV plants larger than 1 MWp in Europe, the US and China that have been damaged by severe weather leading to all PV modules being removed, though many can be intact. “The most cost-effective method is to collect reusable modules at the decommissioning site with the sorting, visual and electrical testing and documentation directly completed upon removal and even including small repairs of the external electrical components of the modules (cabling, connectors, diodes),” the report notes.
Eszter Voroshazi, R&D manager at Imec/EnergyVille, says technical guidelines and standards detailing the sorting and testing steps and, most importantly, setting the technical criteria to qualify modules for reuse “are a must to ensure the high quality of reused modules. It might be worthwhile to consider only PV modules for reuse which still have a power above 70% of their initial value and to exclude PV modules with defects having an even minor concern for safety.”
The implementation of such requirements, which are currently totally absent, “would ensure homogenous product quality and build trust towards clients and the original equipment manufacturers,” Voroshazi adds.
“In principle, preparing PV modules for reuse has no negative environmental implications, hence it is a
desirable step as part of the circular economic model for PV,” the report finds. In Europe, eco-design requirements imposed on electrical and electronic equipment measuring CO2 footprints are expected to enter into action for PV
modules in the coming years.
This is likely to make reuse PV modules more competitive and desirable, according to PV Cycle CEO Jan Clyncke.
At the same time, used modules can pose an environmental threat if they are not properly recycled.
“An important note is that the environmental feasibility of the second-hand PV modules is at risk if their adequate recycling is not guaranteed after their second life,” Clyncke adds. “Thus, the current practice of exporting reused PV modules to developing countries with insufficient waste regulations is creating a major environmental concern.”
The reuse of PV modules clearly creates employment opportunities for a technically skilled and local workforce, both in decommissioning and re-installation countries, the study notes. “This should be accompanied by proper training of the workforce, which could lead to the creation of 63 jobs per 1,000 tons of electric and electronic waste according to an estimation of the RRE-USE network. It is important to note that to ensure economic viability of the sector, especially in high-income countries where PV systems are decommissioned, automation in sorting, testing, etc., would be required.
“Such market growth is not only desirable due to the generation of jobs, it also reduces energy poverty in low-income countries, which indirectly contributes to further economic and social development.”
Overall, unclear legislation, the lack of control of the European Commission's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive and the nearly complete lack of similar legislation outside the EU “raise serious environmental and safety concerns about the reuse of PV modules,” the study finds.
“At the dawn of the first decommissioning wave of PV systems, followed by an expected rapid rise of the volumes of reusable PV modules, we ask for a careful assessment of the sector and its adequate regulations in consultation with the relevant global actors.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/08/a-chemical-fuse-voltage-sensitive-polymers-in-the-fight-against-battery-fires/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,RUSSIA",MARIAN WILLUHN,"MARCH 8, 2021",A ‘chemical fuse’ – voltage sensitive polymers in the fight against battery fires,"Suppressing a battery fire is no easy task, and a critical condition of success is how fast a technology managed to detect a fault and trigger its responses. A team of researchers led by Oleg Levin, Professor of the Department of Electrochemistry at St. Petersburg University, has developed a new approach that promises to have a competitive edge in early detection and response – polymers that change conductivity as a function of heat or voltage. The researchers claim their method is cheap and scalable. Convinced of the applicability of the technology, the researchers have already received a patent for their invention.
There are multiple reasons for a battery fire, but most come down to overcharging or short-circuiting. For example, in the case of the battery fires in Arizona, local utility Arizona Public Service concluded in a report jointly developed with technical auditor DNV GL that dendrites must have been the culprit. Dendrites in lithium-ion batteries are lithium deposits on the anode. If they grow large enough, they can short-circuit a battery, resulting in a fire.
Batteries have monitoring systems in the form of microcircuits attached to them. They are supposed to track all the battery parameters and shut the circuits down should there be a problem. But Levin claims that in most incidents of the big battery fires, these monitoring systems had failed due to manufacturing defects.
“This is why it was particularly important to develop a safety strategy of the battery based on the chemical reactions to block the flow of electric current inside the battery pack,” said Professor Levin. “To this end, we propose to use a special polymer. Its electrical conductivity can adjust to the voltage fluctuations in the battery. If the battery works normally, the polymer does not prevent the electric current from flowing. If the battery is overcharged, there is a short circuit, or battery voltage drops below normal operating levels, the polymer goes into a so called isolator, circuit breaker, mode.”
When a battery fails due to overcharging or short-circuiting, the temperature rises to above 70°C or 90°C chemical reactions inside the battery are triggered, causing a self-exciting chain reaction. This chain reaction, the thermal runaway, needs to be prevented before a point-of-no-return has been reached. According to the team, this has made much of the research. When the polymer starts acting as an isolator, the damage could already be so significant that the fire will still propagate. In its current development stage, the polymer reacts to voltage rather than heat and is applied over the inner current collector's entire surface.
“The most difficult part in developing the ‘chemical fuse ‘was to find an active polymer,” said Oleg Levin. “We knew a great variety of polymers of this class. Yet choosing the one that would be suitable to create a prototype was a hard nut to crack. Moreover, we had to advance the technology by developing an industrial version to show that we had come up with an idea of effective battery safety strategy.”
Levin reports that researchers at this institute had been dealing with such polymers for the past eight years, but a bespoke project gave new impetus to the project over the last two. That is a little surprising, given the number of battery fires that occurred. According to Levin, between 1999 and 2012 that were 1,013 reported cases, according to Levin, but that number exploded to 25,000 between 2012 and 2018.
And the problem is still far from being solved. Just this week the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has formalized a recall of a home storage product line by LG Chem, due to the risk of overheating and fire.
For the time being, the polymer only works for lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries. The reason is that different cathode compositions work at different voltage levels. For LFP batteries, this is at 3.2 V. Their rival nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cathodes operate at voltages between 3.7 and 4.2 V depending on the type of NMC-cell.
“Changing the structure of the polymer might result in changing its conductivity to make it suitable for other types of cathodes that are on the market today. We have some thoughts as to how to make this safety strategy more universal by adding a safety component into the polymer to adjust to changes in temperature levels in the battery. This is expected to eliminate all fire risks associated with the batteries,” said Levin.

Hydrogels beads are micro-sized particles with cooling properties that are made from natural or synthetics polymers and are commonly applied in biomedical, drug delivery, and biological studies. Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) water-based nanofluids with three different concentrations were used by the scientists as a saturation agent for the hydrogels beads.
Dry hydrogel beads were mixed with the nanofluids through a sonication process, which applies sound energy to agitate particles or discontinuous fibers in a liquid. “Three nano particles weights were measured in fume cabinet and mixed with water to get three percentage’ weight concentrations of (0.1%, 0.25% and 0.5%),” the academics explained.

The saturated beads were then placed below the back surface of simulated PV panels and the cooling solution was tested at standard test conditions radiation with a temperature between 30 and 3 degrees Celsius, relative humidity between 40 and 50% around the panels’ surface, and a wind speed close to near zero. “The panel temperature was measured using 3 K-type thermocouples attached to each back surface and connected to data loggers,” the British-Egyptian group specified.
The experiment showed that the simulated panels with the hydrogels beads exhibited better thermal performance compared with both the uncooled panel and the hydrogel solution that was saturated only with water. “The optimized concentration of 0.5%wt. Alumina-water based nanofluid could significantly reduce the temperature by 17.9 and 16.3 degrees Celsius compared with the uncooled panel at radiation intensities of 800 and 1000 W/m2, respectively,” the academics affirmed. “The optimized concentration could enhance the electricity efficiency of the panels by approximately 10.1%.”
The additional analysis of the costs of the proposed technology showed, the researchers went on to say, that payback time ranges from 16.1 and 12 years at radiation intensities of 800 and 1000 W/m2, respectively. “It can be noticed that due to the expensive cost of the nano material, by increasing the concentration of the nanofluid, the payback period increases,” the research team explained.
“The technology is already viable for commercial production,” research co-author, Saber Abdo, told pv magazine.
The passive cooling technique is presented in the study Effect of using saturated hydrogel beads with alumina water-based nanofluid for cooling solar panels: Experimental study with economic analysis, published in Solar Energy.

EDF EN, a unit of French energy giant EDF, is considering the liquidation of its subsidiary specializing in solar module production Photowatt. According to French financial newspaper LesEchos, the company's factory in Bourgoin-Jallieu, in France's southern region of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, may be closed soon.
The Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes regional council is mobilizing to save the factory and one of its members, Eric Fournier, which is also the regional councillor for Environment, sustainable development, energy and regional nature parks, said that an unspecified company headquartered in the region may be interested in acquiring Photowatt.
LesEchos also revealed that Photowatt had recently conducted a strategic review to explore all possible ways out of its difficult situation. The newspaper said that the reason for EDF's withdrawal from the solar module business was due to its difficult financial situation and the fact that PV is not its core business. “We will make every effort to find the best solution for PhotoWatt and its employees, in particular through industrial partnerships in France and abroad,” a company's spokesperson told pv magazine.
Photowatt was acquired by EDF in 2012. Photowatt was founded in 1979 and initially it produced solar cells for spatial applications.

The ministry said in a statement that it had already identified the five dams of Hapcheon, Gunwi, Chungju, Soyang River, and Imha as potential sites for the implementation of the first floating arrays, adding that projects with a combined capacity of 147 MW were currently under development, without providing further details.
One of them is likely the 41 MW floating project that Korean module manufacturer Hanwha Q Cells announced in November for the Hapcheon dam, which is located in South Korea's South Gyeongsang province, for Korea Water Resources Corp., which is a governmental agency that manages water resources. The panel producer has developed a special series of solar modules for floating solar power plants.
The new 2.1 GW program is part of South Korea's plan to become carbon-neutral by 2050. It will add to the 2.1 GW floating solar complex the South Korean government is developing near the Saemangeum tidal flats, on the coast of the Yellow Sea. The KRW4.6 trillion ($3.82 billion) project was unveiled in 2019. It will be built in two stages, with the first 1.2 GW phase set to come online in late 2022 and adding the remaining capacity by 2025.
South Korea is resorting to floating PV on a larger scale as its PV sector is currently dealing with land availability issues.
South Korea plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030.

In these materials, an oxygen-redox reaction has been shown to store additional charge in oxide ions, as well as in the transition metal ions – potentially boosting the material’s storage capacity.
However, when integrated into a battery, such cathode materials undergo irreversible structural changes upon the first charge, immediately reducing their subsequent voltage. And the mechanisms behind these structural changes have puzzled scientists and held the materials back from further development. With this in mind, the UK’s Faraday Institution set out to observe the structural changes to these cathodes in action.
“In the ever more difficult quest to make incremental improvements to Li-ion battery energy density, being able to harness the potential of oxygen-redox cathodes and the bigger improvements they offer relative to the nickel rich cathodes in commercial use today is potentially significant,” said Peter Bruce, Chief Scientist at the Faraday Institution. “The deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of oxygen-redox is an important step in informing strategies to mitigate the current limitations of such materials, bringing their potential commercial use a step closer to reality.”
Using X-ray imaging techniques at the UK’s Diamond Light Source facility, the group was able to confirm the changes to oxygen that drive the voltage loss after the first charge, and also to develop a model that explains the entire process.

“Computational modeling has demonstrated that the evolution of molecular oxygen explains both the observed electrochemical response – the reduction in voltage on first discharge – and the observed structural changes – explained by the accommodation of the molecular oxygen within the bulk of the material,” said Prof Saiful Islam, University of Bath and CATMAT Principal Investigator. “This single unified model tying molecular oxygen and voltage loss together allows researchers to propose practical strategies for avoiding oxygen-redox-induced instability, offering potential routes towards more reversible high energy density Li-ion cathodes.”
The model is described in the paper The role of O2 in O-redox cathodes for Li-ion batteries, published in Nature Energy. The researchers go on to suggest six different strategies to develop high-energy cathode materials based on this understanding of the oxygen-redox reaction, all of which are set to be explored by the Faraday Institution in follow-up work.

Isigenere, a Spanish engineering company and provider of floating PV structures, has tested a new cleaning robot on a 500 kW floating installation built on an irrigation pond in Mérida province, southern Spain.
The hyCleaner black Solar facelift robot, produced by German manufacturer TG hylift, has a modular design and uses only water without any detergent or chemical additives to clean the panels.
At the Spanish floating plant, the robot utilizes water from an existing irrigation tank located at the facility. However, its manufacturers state that it can also make use of rainwater, tap water, and recycled water, as well as all kinds of water preparation systems.
As the dirt on the panels is only natural dirt, the cleaning water can fall back into the pond without problems.
Water supply is connected through a quick connect fitting, and power is provided by built-in lithium-ion batteries. The robot is simply placed manually on the first row of modules and can be driven by an operator, via remote control with more than 100 meters range. Its design ensures minimal disturbance of the floats as it moves across the installation, and large track wheels make it easy to move between individual modules.
Isigenere notes that, since its Isifloating design does not feature maintenance walkways between rows, cleaning robots such as this are an ideal solution. “In this way, large continuous photovoltaic surfaces are created,” the company said.
The robot also has an edge detection system, stopping it automatically when it reaches the plant edges – even if the operator keeps pressing the joystick to move forward. Once removed from this ‘danger zone', all movements are released again, and cleaning continues.
Depending on the type and intensity of the dirt, the robot can be driven at different speeds. The rotating wash brush has a width of 1100 mm and adapts perfectly to the width of the module. The surfaces of the modules and frames are cleaned in a single operation.
TG hyLIFT states that its robots are manufactured in Germany “from development to production and assembly to quality assurance and careful customer service.” It added that the robot can be used in all installations, also in inclined ones.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison unveiled the federal government’s technology investment roadmap last week as part of its AUD 1.5 billion ($1.2 billion) modern manufacturing strategy, which aims to position the country as a world leader in the renewable energy transition.
A key element in that transition is energy storage, which the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) identified as a critical enabler of cost-effective and reliable low-emission electricity in its 2020 Integrated System Plan. AEMO suggested that up to 19 GW of new dispatchable resources, including battery storage, will be needed to back up renewables in the National Electricity Market (NEM) to 2040.
Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Karen Andrews said that the new roadmap sets out a 10-year vision to build sophisticated manufacturing capability in Australia in the resources sector. She said it shows how businesses can capitalize on Australia’s access to key resources.
“Opportunities outlined in the roadmap include turning critical minerals into high-value products like batteries and solar cells,” Andrews said. “This funding will back businesses to pursue those opportunities and turn innovative ideas into high-value products so we can build on Australia’s competitive advantage and secure greater investment and market share.”
Energy Renaissance Managing Director Mark Chilcote said that Australia is the only country in the world that is sitting on all the raw materials needed to make lithium-ion batteries. He said that the new roadmap presents an opportunity to position the country at the forefront of the industry.
