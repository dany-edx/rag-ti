The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Department of the Treasury, and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that applications are open for the Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program.
Supported by the Inflation Reduction Act, the program intends to help expand access to cost-saving clean energy projects in underserved communities with tax incentives for solar and wind projects across the country.
When combined with other incentives, solar and wind projects in low-income communities could receive as much as a 70% credit, according to Jennifer Granholm, secretary of energy. The program provides an increase of 10 percentage points to the Section 48 investment tax credit (ITC) for qualifying solar and wind energy facilities that are less than 5 MWac located in low-income communities or on Indian Land, and an increase of 20 percentage points for facilities that are built as part of a Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project, or as part of a Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project.
The program allows for up to 1.8 GW of eligible solar and wind capacity to be allocated in credits each year. Treasury and the IRS established the program under section 48(e) to promote cost-saving clean energy investments in low-income communities, on Indian land, as part of affordable housing developments, and benefitting low-income households.
“The Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit program will help community-based projects deliver direct benefits to families, making solar and wind energy more affordable and more accessible — revitalizing communities and exemplifying our whole-of-government effort to support low-income and Tribal communities in their energy transition efforts,” said Granholm.
Eligible applicants can participate in the program immediately through the program’s new applicant portal. DOE is accepting applications for the initial application window over the next 30-days for the 2023 program year. After the initial 30-day application window closes, applications for 2023 will be considered on a rolling basis.
DOE’s Office of Economic Impact and Diversity is administering the Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program on behalf of Treasury and IRS.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/23/merchant-pv-growing-in-spain-germany/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE,GERMANY,SPAIN",ANGELA SKUJINS,"OCTOBER 23, 2023","Merchant PV growing in Spain, Germany","Gaëtan Masson, the CEO of the Becquerel Institute and operating agent for the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Program, told pv magazine in a recent interview that merchant PV is growing in select European markets. He said investors are “starting to jump” on merchant PV and “huge profits.”
“If we look at utility-scale PV, we have three different business cases. Tenders are absolutely not risky. Then PPAs are a little bit more risky, simply because especially with commercial PPA you rely on private companies [and] things can happen during 20 years,” he said. “The last option is probably riskier – it's merchant PV. But if you look at Germany or Spain with merchant PV, and the prospects for high wholesale market prices, the perspective for huge profits are significantly higher than then the risk associated, so it's a different kind of investments.”
Masson said he sees this trend gathering steam in certain European markets, such as Spain and Germany. It is starting to gain pace in Italy, he said, but it is not as pronounced because of the country's unstable solar regulations.
“Europe is probably the best case for the time being because of relatively high wholesale prices, and predictably high wholesale prices,” he said. “If you look at the LCOE of PV in south Spain, which is around €20 ($21.17)/MWh when you have market prices in between €50 and €100, it's a no-brainer.”
Masson co-authored a recently published IEAPPSP report, “Trends in photovoltaic applications 2023.” It identifies key shifts in the PV sector from the past year, including the growth of merchant PV opportunities in numerous countries for the second year in a row. This shift is particularly apparent “in established markets where it is pulled by high electricity consumption prices,” the report states.
“The design of the electricity market plays an important role for the emergence of this type of business model as the market should provide both short term and long term incentives,” the report continues. “Norway saw its first [merchant-based PV plant] project licensed in 2022, Australia has 18% of its nearly 20 GW capacity exposed to spot markets, Hungary and Italy already have merchant PV systems. Experts estimate that up to half of future utility scale projects in Spain could be merchant PV.”
Masson, who is also co-chair of the European Solar Manufacturing Council, said he believes that merchant PV sales will rise – up to a certain point.
“Something that California popularized a few years ago is the concept of the curve, where the more you produce PV in the midday, the more wholesale prices are going down,” he said. “We don't see it yet in Europe, but it will most probably happen in Spain at some point.”
Masson said something that consistently surprises him while researching international PV trends is that data collection is unequal.
“We are developing a technology that is considered mainstream, but few countries know what exactly is happening in their own country,” he said.
An example of the impact of this failure is utilities rolling out inappropriate solar tenders, Masson said, noting Vietnam as a case study.
“I went there and I worked with Vietnamese operators and utilities and they were thinking about installing 800 MW of PV,” he said. “And the other way around … if you look at some African countries, no one has any idea of what is installed. No one. How can you define the renewable energy development policy if you don't have any idea what you have at the time?”
This could be amended if all solar stakeholders – from distribution operators and grid operators to installers – report installed capacity, according to Masson.
Stagnant policy is also affecting the scope of solar deployment. This is visible in the scale of manufacturing compared to installed capacity in 2022, Mason said.
“The market could have been significantly higher in 2022,” he argued, “But it wasn’t. Why? Because we start to touch the limits of existing policies.”
Social acceptance and training a skilled workforce remain huge hurdles to widespread PV utilization. Masson said he is confident that these challenges cannot be overcome without “strong approval from policymakers.”
“The energy transition starts to destroy – massively – jobs in the conventional energy industry. That's normal. But we have to create similar jobs in the PV industry,” he said. A means of creating these jobs is scaling up Europe’s solar PV manufacturing capabilities, which will reassure policymakers that there is job creation in the sector, Masson said. “All these political obstacles or barriers are slowing down the speed at which the market is growing. Otherwise, we will be at 400 GW this year.”

Aneel has approved the opening of a public consultation to discuss alternative regulatory solutions for the integration of storage systems in the Brazilian electricity sector.
The proposal aims to advance the regulatory process to allow the integration of storage systems, including pumped storage plants, as a tool to support the sustainable energy transition.
Aneel will implement the provisions in three phases. Phase one (2022-23) focuses on defining storage resources and services, including addressing access, regulatory adjustments, and eliminating barriers, lasting 18 months. Phase two (2023-24) deals with pumped hydro storage specifics and regulatory sandboxes for revenue stacking, also lasting 18 months.
In the last cycle (2024-25), Aneel will explore complex topics, including the creation of aggregators, computational model simulations, new business models for curtailment mitigation and revenue stacking. This 18-month phase aims to facilitate the integration of new storage solutions into the Brazilian electricity sector, with five specific objectives supported by eight normative and five non-normative solutions.
The Public Consultation will receive contributions from 10/19 to 12/18/23, through an electronic form, on the Forms platform, which will be made available in Public Consultation No. 039/2023 at this link.

Reliance Industries, which is setting up a fully integrated battery gigafab in the Indian state of Gujarat, has started trial runs of its swappable EV batteries with online grocer BigBasket in Bangalore. For now, the batteries are being made in-house with imported LFP cells, the company representatives told pv magazine. 
The company is currently focusing on the e-mobility market, particularly electric two-wheelers, and has established swappable battery charging stations in Bangalore. EV users can use a mobile app to find and reserve the nearest charging station, operated by Reliance, to exchange their depleted battery for a fully charged one.
These batteries can be charged with grid or solar power and paired with inverters to power home appliances. Additionally, Reliance has created an advanced energy management system for consumers to monitor, manage, and measure their electricity consumption through a mobile app.
“It can take in the grid, your battery, solar power generation, DG, and home loads and manage which load should be powered from where and what needs to be charged,” said a company representatives.
Reliance Industries is betting on cobalt-free  LFP technology and sodium-ion for its proposed fully integrated energy storage giga-factory in India. Following the acquisition of sodium-ion battery provider Faradion, Reliance Industries, through its Reliance New Energy unit, acquired Netherlands-based LFP battery specialist Lithium Werks.
The Lithium Werks assets acquired by Reliance include its entire patent portfolio, manufacturing facility in China, key business contracts, and hiring of existing employees. 
Reliance's use of LFP battery technology aligns with the global shift toward cobalt-free cathode chemistries due to cobalt's availability and price challenges in manufacturing metal-oxide batteries like NMC and LCO. Approximately 60% of global cobalt supply originates from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a region associated with human rights violations, corruption, environmental harm, and child labor in cobalt mining.

A Dutch solar-powered electric car team from Eindhoven University has successfully completed the North African test race with its road-legal solar car, Stella Terra, covering a route from northern Morocco to the Sahara Desert.
The Stella Terra vehicle has a top speed of 145 km per hour, weighs 1,200 kg, and has a range of 710 km when there’s enough sun. The Eindhoven University team said the vehicle achieved an average range of about 550 km, depending on the surface, which included dry riverbeds, forest area, along steep mountain trails and loose desert sand.
The Eindhoven University team was once a regular in Australia’s iconic Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, a biennial 3,000 km expedition from Darwin to Adelaide, and boasts four wins in the Cruiser class. But the team has this year chosen to focus on the development of its solar-powered off-road car.
Among the teams that will line up in the race this year is the University of New South Wales (UNSW). The team’s Sunswift 7 solar-powered electric car holds the world record for the fastest electric vehicle over 1,000 km on a single charge. The team will be seeking to better that when it lines up in this year’s edition of the race, which starts in Darwin.
The team’s most recent car design, the Sunswift 7, will compete in the Cruiser class, where once the Eindhoven team pushed them in competition. The Sunswift team must complete the three stages across 3,600 km using only the power of the sun.

Peak Energy has set out to use cheaper and more abundant raw materials to design sodium-ion battery energy storage systems (BESS). While a sodium-ion BESS is 30% less energy dense than those made from lithium-ion chemistries, they are also about 20% to 40% cheaper, says Landon Mossburg, who co-owns Peak Energy with Cameron Dales.
The United States has 19% of the world’s soda ash, from which sodium is derived. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, six companies in Wyoming and California comprise the US soda ash industry. which is the largest in the world.
Peak Energy sees the ability to scale as another bottleneck. To overcome this challenge, the company is leveraging partnerships with international and domestic sodium cell manufacturers to introduce this technology to the United States, while generating enough income to establish a local engineering site and gigafactory.
“We’ll do this in three phases,” Mossburg said.
Currently ongoing, the first phase involves importing the sodium-ion battery cells from manufacturers based in Asia, Europe and North America while producing packs in the United States. The company plans to launch small-scale demonstration systems early next year with an expected energy capacity and duration of 3 MWh.
“When stacked together, they can create a larger scale utility system,” Mossburg said.
The company will scale these systems to several 100 MWh commercial projects throughout 2026.
Peak Energy is currently testing cells from potential partners to decipher the best technology for US markets. However, Dales suggests their systems will likely consist of a hard carbon anode and a layered oxide, Prussian white or polyanion cathode.

People working in residential solar are familiar with the “solar coaster,” which is an experience of boom and bust that the industry has experienced as market and regulatory changes cause wild oscillations in business results. The residential solar sector is currently suffering a deep drop on the “solar coaster.”
A few macro forces are crushing the sector today. High interest rates have worsened the attractive loan packages made available to homeowners, and loan dealer fees have skyrocketed. Utility electricity prices have stabilized and even fallen from last year, making the prospective savings for a rooftop solar customer murkier.
Major residential solar stocks have shed 30% or more of their value in a single day following a foreboding Tesla earnings call, and reports of bankruptcy filings have surfaced.
Most installers are increasingly moving to a third party-owned lease or power purchase agreement model as loan terms have become increasingly unattractive to customers.
What’s more, California, which represents about half of the United States’ residential solar market, essentially set its residential solar market on fire with its new net metering rules. As the backlog of customers who rushed in to secure legacy Net Energy Metering (NEM) 2.0 rates dries up, the devastation of NEM 3.0 has begun to reveal itself.
NEM 3.0 slashed compensation for delivering local, clean electricity generated by a rooftop solar array to your neighbors. Rates paid by the utility for exporting solar were cut by about 80%. Installations have pulled back by 40% to 80% in California following the decision.
The onslaught may continue for California, as its commission mulls enabling investor-owned utilities to assign income-based fixed charges to its customers. It is also weighing a decision to limit the value of multi-family rooftop solar installations, despite spending the past two years justifying NEM changes based on a desire to make solar more accessible to renters and low-income customers.
Bernadette del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA), said that the state’s utility commission has taken the approach of “the beatings will continue until morale approves” for residential solar.

The new approach, which the researchers called SpatIo-temporaL scIentific ComputatiONs (Silicon), is based on a geographic information system (GIS), which helps analyze geographical cells at a spatial resolution of 100 m.
“To tackle the issue of country-specific cost elements, the model incorporates a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) breakdown often used by governmental and intergovernmental organizations,” the research group clarified. “The proposed approach can be utilized to develop national and regional strategies focused on large-scale PV installations, facilitating the attainment of renewable energy goals.”
The method comprises two main modules: one intended to analyze land eligibility and another one focused on techno-economic assessment.
As for land eligibility, the method uses two kinds of datasets, either in raster or vector format. A raster dataset is a GIS dataset format that represents data as grids of cells or pixels and is ideal for continuous phenomena like elevation and temperature. A vector dataset, on the other hand, represents features as points, lines, or polygons with precise boundaries, making it suitable for marking data like roads and cities.
“In the case of vector datasets, geometries are either expanded through the application of a buffer or converted into a raster format,” the researchers said. “For raster datasets, map pixels representing the geographic extent of the country are assigned binary values. Subsequently, exclusions pertaining to the availability of land are applied to indicate buffer distances and land specifications.”
The model is trained to find an area that will fit a utility PV system, based on some exclusion criteria. For example, the method knows not to place a system within a 5 km distance from an airport, 120 m from power lines and 200 m from bird protection areas. It also excludes geographical areas with elevation above 2,000 m or slopes above 30 degrees.
The output of this first step is all the eligible land that a country might offer for large scale PV deployment. This output is then used as an input in the techno-economic assessments model, which yields results such as the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) in the same resolution of 100 m. To make that calculation applicable to different economic zones, the method asks to input information, such as local installation, hardware, and soft costs.
“The second component relies on established financial concepts, such as capital investment costs, operational and maintenance costs, and the levelized cost of electricity,” the academics further explained, noting that the costs can be transformed into formulas adaptable to various case studies.
To validate their model, the scientists applied it to Poland and found that around 3.61% of the country's available land may host utility-scale solar PV systems, corresponding to an area of about 11,277.70 km2. Depending on land use efficiency, that area can be used to host a PV capacity ranging from 394.64 GW to 563.77 GW. The results also indicate the LCOE could range from €0.043 ($0,045)/kWh to €0.049/kWh, with a national average of €0.045/kWh.
“Furthermore, it was found that most of the suitable sites for the deployment of utility-scale PV systems are concentrated in four regions located in the central and western parts of Poland (Ło´dzkie, Lubelskie, Podlaskie, and Mazowiecki),” the team added. “These regions account for more than 50% of the total capacity and electricity production potential. Additionally, Mazowiecki represents around 20% of the installable capacity potential.”
The new approach was introduced in the paper “A GIS-based method for assessing the economics of utility-scale photovoltaic systems,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.

Inverted perovskite cells have a device structure known as “p-i-n”, in which hole-selective contact p is at the bottom of intrinsic perovskite layer i with electron transport layer n at the top. Conventional halide perovskite cells have the same structure but reversed – a “n-i-p” layout. In n-i-p architecture, the solar cell is illuminated through the electron-transport layer (ETL) side; in the p-i-n structure, it is illuminated through the hole‐transport layer (HTL) surface.
The scientists said they anchored the SAM on a nickel oxide nanoparticle surface to form the charge extraction layer, which they said optimized the dipole moment for fast hole extraction and led to a low defect density.
“We discovered that high-temperature exposure can cause the chemical bonds within SAM molecules to fracture, negatively impacting device performance. So our solution was akin to adding a heat-resistant armor – a layer of nickel oxide nanoparticles, topped by a SAM, achieved through an integration of various experimental approaches and theoretical calculations,” stated the researchers.
The SAM is able to stabilize the interface between the perovskite absorber and the hole transport layer (HTL) made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx). The energetic alignment, the favorable contact and the binding between the HTL and the perovskite reduced the typical voltage deficit of perovskite cells, leading to strong interface toughening effects under thermal stress, according to the research team.
“By introducing a thermally robust charge extraction layer, our improved cells retain over 90% of their efficiency, boasting an impressive efficiency rate of 25.6%, even after operated under high temperatures, around 65 C for over 1,000 hours. This is a milestone achievement,” said CityU researcher Zhu Zonglong. “This breakthrough is pivotal as it addresses a major obstacle that previously impeded wider adoption of perovskite solar cells.”
The academics presented their innovation in the paper “Stabilized hole-selective layer for high-performance inverted p-i-n perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Science.
In April 2022, the same research group fabricated another inverted perovskite solar cell based on an organometallic compound known as ferrocenyl-bis-thiophene-2-carboxylate (FcTc2), which is claimed to improve both the efficiency and stability of the PV device.
