Researchers are testing a variety of different routes to reproducing the already impressive results shown in small-scale laboratory devices in an industrial setting, which will require a move away from the spin-coating processes used in research.
Slot die coating, where an ‘ink’ flows from a rectangular slot onto a moving substrate below, is one of the most promising approaches, proven in other industries to allow low cost, reproducible production at scale. And perovskite researchers have been hard at work optimizing perovskite precursor solutions to be deposited in this way, and to maintain stability and performance over a much larger area.
Crystallization
Controlling the crystallization of the material as it is coated is key to producing efficient solar cells, and this was the focus for scientists at Germany’s Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin (HZB) working on a perovskite material suitable for slot die coating. “One of the most important aspects to optimize slot‐die coating for MHP [metal-halide perovskite] deposition is to develop reproducible coating processes where the MHP crystallization is selectively induced during the coating process,” the scientists explain.
The group found that adding a ‘coordinating solvent’ to the precursor material gave them additional control over this crystallization process, and that adding exactly the right amount improved the quality of the resulting thin film.
The additive, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), was shown to encourage the growth of perovskite crystals and improve the quality. Add to much though, and other processes begin to have a negative effect. “It's like seasoning a soup,” explains HZB scientist Eva Unger. “If you add too little, it remains bland. If you add too much, it won't taste good either. So you need to add just the right amount to make it best.”
At a concentration of 11.7 mole-percent (mol%), the group was able to produce solar cells at 20.83% efficiency (stabilized at 20.55%). The work is described in the paper 20.8% Slot‐Die Coated MAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells by Optimal DMSO‐Content and Age of 2‐ME Based Precursor Inks, published in Advanced Energy Materials.
The group also investigated how long their inks would last, finding that the 11.7 mol% solution could still produce 19.5% efficient cells after 18 days in storage, while higher concentrations of DMSO could not produce good quality coatings at all after this time. “This is an aspect that has received little attention so far”, Unger explains. “The age of a perovskite precursor ink can influence device performance. This is an important factor that must be considered when developing inks and processes.”

Switzerland‘s solar energy industry association Swissolar estimates that between 430 to 460 MW of new PV systems have been installed in 2020. If confirmed by official statistics, this would represent growth of 30-39% compared to 2019, when around 330 MW of solar was deployed.
According to the association's analysts, the residential and commercial segments both performed strongly on the back of recent improvements to the country's solar rebate scheme and an increased awareness of climate issues, which is pushing homeowners and businesses to become prosumers.
The Covid-19 pandemic has also played a role, visible in the fact many citizens have found the time to follow through on projects, and because of an increased availability of capital due to fewer spending opportunities. Swissolar is currently unable to assess whether these effects will continue into the current year, however.
Despite the good performance, the association said the current level of solar development will not be enough to reach Switzerland's climate targets. “In order to replace the nuclear power that is no longer available and to cover the additional electricity demand for the electrification of transport and heating, the annual growth must be increased to around 1,500 MW over the next few years – almost four times as much as last year,” said director David Stickelberger.
In its “Energy Strategy 2050”, the Swiss Ministry of Energy is targeting an installed solar PV capacity of 37.5 GW in 2050. However, Swissolar considers the current framework conditions inadequate to achieve this result.
To address the issues, the association has proposed a set of measures that should help to significantly accelerate the pace of expansion. For example, it is demanding greater funding for rooftop PV systems that are not intended for self-consumption. It further highlights the opportunity for numerous roofs, for instance on stables or warehouses, that do not currently host PV systems because the electricity cannot be consumed on site. The same applies to carports or noise barriers.
Furthermore, Swissolar has requested that the hurdles currently hindering the development of utility scale solar plants be removed.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/03/new-parameters-to-improve-prediction-models-for-snow-cover/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CANADA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 3, 2021",New parameters to improve prediction models for snow cover,"Scientists at the University of Alberta in Canada have developed a new set of parameters to improve short-term models to forecast the impact of snow on PV installations.
The researchers said that the new parameters should enhance the accuracy of snow-cover prediction models that forecast electricity losses by estimating snow conditions. Grid operators often use these models to assess the impact of snow accumulation on PV systems in the winter months.
The academics considered solar irradiance, including irradiance that can penetrate through snow and reach solar panels. Their parameters also include the warming effect of irradiance on the back surface of panels and their thermal capacity, which may also contribute to the melting of snow.
The scientists conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the contribution of each of these three parameters for snow melt predictions. They tested their approach on three panels mounted on a frame that allowed the tilt angle to be adjusted from 13 degrees to 71 degrees.
“The frame was constructed of wood to reduce the heat transmission between the panels and frame,” the scientists said. “To prevent additional obstructions to snow clearing, the panels were installed without any hardware protruding beyond the front surface of the panels and the mounting frame was not in the path of sliding snow.”
They took pictures of snow accumulation depths on the panels at two-minute intervals during each snowfall and melting event, and manually measured the snow thickness on-site. They defined a “melting event” as any visually identifiable melting over a large section of a panel, while they defined “sliding” as any displacement of snow down the surface of PV panels. The research team also tested the thermal capacitance of the panels and the amount of irradiance absorbed by their surface to understand how much the snow could melt or slide away from the modules.
“The results of this study suggest that replacing front (plane-of-array) irradiance with absorbed irradiance can substantially reduce the uncertainty in identifying the beginning of snow clearing.” the scientists said. “The coefficient of determination was improved by a factor of four and further modeling improvements were achieved by considering the thermal capacitance of the panels.”
They claim that their proposed model can be applied to all types of PV systems in different regions. They described the new parameters in “A sensitivity analysis on effective parameters for sliding/melting prediction of snow cover on solar photovoltaic panels,” which was recently published in Cold Regions Science and Technology.

Spanish renewable energy company Ibereólica has submitted a proposal to build a 1.17 GW hybrid wind-solar power plant to Chile‘s environmental evaluation service SEA.
The ERNC Antofagasta project, which is being planned by Ibereólica ERNC Antofagasta, a special purpose vehicle company owned by Ibereólica, will consist of a 496 MW wind farm and a 675 MW solar PV plant.
“We are very serious about this project, everything will depend on the environmental evaluation in Chile, which is quite strict,” the general director of Ibereólica, José Manuel Ramos, told pv magazine. “But are confident that it will be launched, as we already have long experience in developing projects in the country.” The project is set to be located in the region of Antofagasta, in northern Chile.
Last summer, Repsol and Ibereólica sealed an agreement to create a 50% joint venture. By virtue of this agreement, Repsol will have access to a 1.6 GW portfolio of projects that Ibereólica has in operation, construction or development in Chile. Recently,  the joint venture obtained approval for the development of the 500 MW Antofagasta Solar Project in the country. The Chilean joint venture has a diversified portfolio comprising 52% wind and 48% PV. The agreement includes the option for Repsol to take control of the company from 2025. 
In 2019, the Spanish oil group established a renewable energy subsidiary, Repsol Renovables. The company plans to have 4.5 GW of clean energy generation capacity by 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/03/creating-an-alternative-pv-supply-chain-in-the-us-is-no-cakewalk/,"INVERTERS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,CHINA,UNITED STATES",,"MARCH 3, 2021",Creating an alternative PV supply chain in the US is no cakewalk,"From pv magazine USA
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) in December launched a campaign against forced labor, announced the development of a supply chain traceability protocol for materials used to produce solar modules, and said it was “strongly encouraging” member companies to move their supply chains out of the Xinjiang region of China.
In early February, SEIA and 175 member companies signed a pledge opposing forced labor in the solar supply chain. In an interview with pv magazine USA, SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper announced a goal for companies to readjust their supply chains by June.
Global solar wafer production is almost completely in Chinese hands, but mostly not located in Xinjiang (with the notable exception of one major vertically integrated manufacturer).
What will likely happen is this: Wafer manufacturers, who usually blend polysilicon volumes from different suppliers, will exclude feedstock from Xinjiang from the mix for part of their production in order to offer “Xinjiang-free” wafers. Those can then be used for solar cells and modules destined for export to the U.S.; European customers will probably demand products untainted by forced labor as well.
Service providers, such as Clean Energy Associates, will conduct supply chain audits that ensure the necessary evidence at customs.
In terms of volumes, this shift in wafer production will not pose a major challenge. PV installations in the U.S. and Europe together made up roughly 30% of the global market in 2020.
In contrast, around 45% of the global solar-grade polysilicon output in 2020 came from the four Xinjiang-based manufacturers: Daqo, Xinte, Xinjiang GCL and East Hope. Conversely, this means that 55% was produced outside Xinjiang (35% in other Chinese regions and 20% outside China).
That’s more than enough to supply the PV markets in the U.S. and Europe. Should international project developers jump on the anti-forced-labor bandwagon, however, the PV supply chain could experience major friction.
Michael Parr, executive director of the western Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance, has now suggested that excess polysilicon production capacities in the U.S. and Europe could support the shift of supply chains away from Xinjiang. Such a contribution – if realistic at all – would be very small, though.
Apart from a tiny 1,600-ton facility in Germany, it is not clear where Parr sees dormant polysilicon factories in Europe. In the U.S., REC Silicon’s mothballed plant in Moses Lake, Washington, and decommissioned reactors at Hemlock Semiconductor might provide an additional capacity of 40,000 metric tons. Compare this to a capacity of 330,000 tons which the four players in Xinjiang are aiming to achieve by the end of this year.
Tensions are heating up globally surrounding the issue of forced labor, with calls increasing for supply chain transparency, and EU draft legislation recently published on corporate due diligence and accountability to improve upon the currently available voluntary measures. Against this backdrop, pv magazine’s UP Initiative will spend Q2 2021 looking at what solar and energy storage companies can do to lead by positive example when it comes to the workers, often far removed, involved in the production of their products and services.
Even if an additional 40,000 tons was available in the U.S., a wafer production capacity of 14 GW outside China would be required to process these volumes. This magnitude is not yet in sight.
Creating an alternative supply chain will be no cakewalk – it is a monumental task.

Spanish solar company Transición Energética Solar (Tranesol) and Sapiens Energía, a non-profit cooperative specialized in the creation and management of energy communities, have joined forces to promote the first agrivoltaic projects in Spain that will be built under the energy community formula.
In a first phase, Sapiens Energía and Tranesol will build two projects in the Valencian community, in the towns of Picassent, with an installed capacity of 1.5 MW; and in Montserrat, where the project will have an installed power of 1 MW.
The two companies specified that the two projects, which could be expanded at a later stage, are expected to meet, each, the energy needs of some 500 users. The generated power will be shared between individuals, companies and public bodies. 
Construction of the two facilities should begin before the summer, with completion being scheduled by the end of 2021. Valencia-based company Ingeniería y Desarrollos Renovables (Inderen) will act as EPC contractor. 
Tanesol specified that the two agrivoltaic facilities are the first high voltage renewable energy community (CER) projects to be developed in Spain. The projects will be co-financed by Spain's Institute for Diversification and Saving of Energy; the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); and users that join the project as partners of the energy community through the Sapiens Energía cooperative. The project is also open “to companies with concern for their social and environmental impacts, to join.”
Currently, of the 33 projects of local energy communities registered in Spain by the Institute for Diversification and Saving of Energy that are in different stages of development, eight are framed in the Valencian community. The Valencian Institute of Business Competitiveness (IVACE), dependent on the Ministry of Economy, has announced that this year it will quadruple the line of non-refundable grants for the development of photovoltaic installations in local energy communities, with up to €2 million. The grants cover up to 65% of the total investment.

The company said that a memorandum of understanding for the ‘Base One' project was signed in mid-February with the state governor Camilo Santana and that the planned facility should generate over 600 million kilograms of green hydrogen per year. “Enegix’s planned next-generation facility will be run completely using renewable energy, with zero emissions, and will harness the great renewable energy potential that Ceará has available, with solar and onshore and offshore wind to be realized, allowing Base One to be expanded to over 100 GW to meet global demand,” the Australian company said in a statement.
The US$5.4 billion plant is expected to be powered by around 3.4 GW of combined wind and solar capacity, which Enegix Energy said has already been contracted with Brazilian renewable energy company Enerwind. The chosen location is claimed to have direct access to all major international markets via ocean freight. “Our partnership with the Ceará state government is a major milestone for the company. Base One will turn Ceará into a major hydrogen export location and establish Enegix as a global renewable power producer aligning with our vision and strategy to replace expensive, high-emission power grids with renewable, baseload, and cost-effective zero-carbon grids,” Enegix Energy CEO Wesley Cooke stated.
The company has recently hired an unnamed international engineering firm for the feasibility study on the project and is currently seeking investors through an open capital round. The hydrogen plant construction may require up to four years.
The Brazilian state of Ceará is currently seeing strong development of unsubsidized PV projects linked to power purchase agreements. The region has very favorable climatic conditions for solar power projects.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/03/raising-the-temperature-on-module-standards/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MARCH 3, 2021",Raising the temperature on module standards,"Scientists led by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) laid out the rationale behind a new set of specifications, titled Guidelines for qualifying PV modules components and materials for operation at high temperatures, or IEC 63126: 2020 ED1, published last year by global standards body the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
The group at NREL noted that current standards regarding temperature rely on broad assumptions that may not take into account the range of temperatures, and extended periods operating at an elevated, that a module could experience in the field – particularly for hotter regions with a hotter climate such as India or Saudi Arabia, whose capital Riyadh the group took as a model to demonstrate their approach to temperature in PV module testing
The new IEC specification outlines a different approach to testing, which should allow for better understanding of different installation environments to be worked into PV module testing earlier on. “The 2016 versions of IEC 61215 and IEC 61730 contain references to ‘rack-mount’ versus ‘roof mounting’ installations, which only indirectly reflect the actual concern which is the microenvironment of the module,” they explain. “The microenvironment is a function of both the geographic location and the means by which the module is mounted. The committee writing a high temperature module standard, IEC 63126, decided to define the module microclimate temperature by its 98th percentile temperature because this was found to be a robust, representative, and easily measured value.”
Where other approaches have focused on the maximum temperature a module operates at, the group at NREL found that dropping this down to the 98th percentile was more representative. “…there is only a very small amount of time, measured in hours per year, where the temperature is within a few degrees of this maximum.”
At the 98th percentile, meanwhile, NREL calculated that modules would operate for at least 175 hours per year, with several days where the module runs at this temperature continuously for three hours or more. They verified their approach by modeling various system types based on the climate in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Full details of this modeling are found in the paper Standards development for modules in high-temperature microenvironments, published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
While previous module testing standards often assumed a maximum module operating temperature of 90 degrees Celsius, the new standards split this into two levels – 90 and 110 degrees, and allow system designers to determine the most relevant level for a particular setting. The NREL group found that an even higher level might theoretically be needed, for example for modules insulated at the rear and installed in a high-temperature region, but was unable to find actual examples of installations like this. “There is a general belief that heat transfer restrictive installation methods would not be favored in such locations due to performance loss,” they explain. “As such, the project team holds open the possibility for higher Level, but they are considered unnecessary at this time.”

“The results of some key tenders which were announced recently, show a price increase of between 10 and 15% and an even higher increase is being considered for the upcoming ones,” she told pv magazine. “[The] China market has a crucial role as a solar PV price indicator as it brings to the forefront the raw material shortage.”
Qian cited a recent 30 MW tender linked to agricultural production and held by Chinese energy company Guangdong Energy Group Co Ltd. “According to the bidding analysis, the highest quotation of dual-glass modules is RMB1.79/watt ($0.27),” Qian explained. “Therefore the market still sees the trend of increased prices.”
According to her, this hike in prices depends on the shortage of supply of module frames and raw materials such as polysilicon, glass, and silver, as well as the lack of manufacturing capacity to meet current strong demand. Qian also cited a recent report from the China Silicon Association which revealed that the price range of monocrystalline is currently between RMB102,000 and 107,000 ($15,800-16,600) per ton, and the average transaction price is RMB103,400 RMB/ton, up 11.78% month-over-month.
“Since March, the monocrystalline wafer price of Longi has been comprehensively raised; [the] G1, M6 (170μm) monocrystalline silicon wafer quotation[s are] RMB3.55/piece ($0.55) [and] RMB3.65/piece, with an increase [of] up to 9%,” the vice president said. “Based on this, 175μm has increased by RMB0.05/piece ($0.01). The price rise is as high as 9.6%.” She also explained that raw materials such as iron and steel and aluminum have also seen a sharp price increase recently.
Qian also stated that, although glass and polysilicon producers are seeking to increase their capacity–as well as other raw material suppliers–setting up more factories and production lines will require time. “When combined with the U.S. dollar's continuous depreciation–following stimulus measures to ease public hardship during the pandemic–a further increase in PV panel prices can be expected in no time,” she added. “The rushing demand cannot stop prices from rising at least for [the] next six months or longer, until sufficient capacity ramps up.”
The current shortage, according to her, has left panel manufacturers unable to cope with the rising cost transferred from upstream that occurred since the second quarter of last year.

A town that lists one large letterbox and a replica coal mine among its top attractions probably isn’t the setting that springs to mind when you think of the global race to produce a crucial component of  lithium-ion batteries. But Collie, a town of 7,000 people in Western Australia, is precisely that.
Soon, Collie could be home to one of the world’s first battery anode material producers outside of China. The key component of battery anode material (BAM) is graphite. Often overlooked, the mineral is at the heart of battery anode materials in lithium-ion batteries. And niche as it may sound, BAM is claiming its position in the energy sector’s limelight more and more by the day.
“The opportunity is right now in terms of timing, in terms of demand for the product, and in terms of buyers of the product openly stating in the media and in person that they need to have more than one geographic source of supply,” International Graphite CEO Neil Rinaldi told pv magazine Australia.
The Perth-based startup is one of just a handful of companies seeking to diversify BAM production away from China in time for the imminent global battery boom. But Rinaldi acknowledges that when he heard the startup had decided to open a plant in the remote town of Collie, his first reaction was “Really? And then the penny dropped, and the penny-dropping event was cheap power.”
China currently controls 90% of the market for the purified product that goes into BAM, according to Rinaldi. And that is something that leaves many in the world of battery production a little uneasy, he says.
“It doesn’t take a genius to work out why,” he says, noting that a lot of battery manufacturers are eager to diversify their BAM supply. “We intend on being one of the first outside of China. We’re sort of in the first wave of producers, but I think the industry is going to grow quite dramatically over the coming decades – but you’ve got to start somewhere, right?”

“The Shuttle lift system has been developed based on the strength and stability calculations of our RS Tower 52-S,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The special end-frame enables you to put the solar panel safely and easily onto the work platform.”
The system consists of guide profiles, a winch, and various consoles. The guide profiles are easy to clamp to the rungs and the winch is operated by a cordless drill, the company said.
“Rubber strips on the inside of the clamping system prevent damage to the solar panel,” the spokesperson explained.
