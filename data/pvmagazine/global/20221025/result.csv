The US real estate company installed a 25 m solar array was installed on the side of the company’s seven-story building near Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with the support of Arch Solar. The array, which is now operational, is expected to produce about 58 MWh of electricity annually and will help defray the cost of electricity for tenants in the office building.
“Arch Solar covered the building facade was covered with 120 solar modules with an output of 450 W each, which were provided by Chinese manufacturer ZNshine,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. The installation uses SE100k inverters and P960 optimizers provided by Israel-based manufacturer Solaredge. The optimizers are intended to overcome shading from neighboring buildings.
“Solar represents a huge market opportunity for commercial office locations,” explains Mike O’Connor, Co-Founder of Dominion Properties. “Being an office building – where typical working hours are when the most energy is used – a proportion of the building’s energy will come from solar. This means our tenants can enjoy savings on their energy bills, particularly important today as the cost of energy continues to skyrocket. This project is the first of many, and we hope that it will encourage other developers to make use of otherwise wasted space on high-rise buildings by embracing solar as a clean, cost-saving energy source.”
Attaching traditional solar modules on the side of a high-rise building takes some innovation and Arch Solar used masonry anchors to secure the modules to the side of the building in an array that’s 25 m high by 23 m wide. Because the building is in a populated area, the challenge was to avoid reduced output due to shading from surrounding buildings. Arch Solar attached SolarEdge’s power optimizers to the modules technology as well as three SolarEdge Inverters with Synergy Technology to ensure maximum power generation.
“This far North in Milwaukee, the ideal installation for modules is at a 23° angle for maximum sun exposure and to help snow clear. However, for wall installations such as the vertical high-rise array with Dominion Properties, this is a more complex challenge, as the modules need to be mounted at a 90° angle. If you don’t want to lose power efficiency, then really SolarEdge’s inverters and Power Optimizers are the only choice,” said JD Smith, head of business development at Arch Solar. “For Dominion Properties, maximizing power generation to ensure maximum savings for tenants was a non-negotiable, so having access to this technology is what made this project possible.”
Smith noted that the Synergy inverters can be oversized by up to 200%, so Dominion has the option to add more modules without additional investment in power electronics.

The government also said it wants to become a catalyst for the global transition towards greener shipping and aviation.
Jakson Green has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the government of Rajasthan to invest about INR 224,000 million ($ 2.7 billion) in a green hydrogen and ammonia project developed in phases in the 2023-2028 period. “Jakson Green will set up a 3,65,000-tons-per-annum green hydrogen and green ammonia plant along with an integrated hybrid renewable power complex in a phase-wise manner,” wrote the Indian company. Jakson Green is an energy transition platform backed by India's Jakson Group. The government of Rajasthan said it would facilitate the project with registrations, approvals and incentives.
Evos, Hydrogenious and Port of Amsterdam have signed an MoU to jointly realize large-scale import facilities for hydrogen at the Port of Amsterdam. The facilities will comprise storage facilities and a LOHC dehydrogenation plant with a final release capacity of between 100 and 500 tons of hydrogen per day. “The objective is to have the first plants for delivery of hydrogen to local off-takers in operation before 2028, with the potential of further upscale. In total, the handled LOHC volumes will be at least 1 million tons per annum,” the parties wrote. The tank storage company, the LOHC company, and the Port of Amsterdam have completed a feasibility study on different liquid hydrogen carriers, suggesting that thermal oil benzyl toluene (LOHC-BT) technology is a compatible solution with the existing infrastructure at the Port of Amsterdam.
Jericho Energy Ventures and Exogen Hydrogen Solutions have executed an MoU to bring to the EU a hydrogen boiler technology, known as Dynamic Combustion Chamber (DCC) Boiler. “Hydrogen Technologies, a fully owned subsidiary of JEV, has patented a breakthrough method for burning pure hydrogen and oxygen in a vacuum chamber to create high-temperature water and/or steam with zero greenhouse gases,” wrote the North American company. Traditional H2-ready boilers burn H2 in the presence of atmospheric air, generating emissions that must be vented via a smokestack. JEV and the London-based Exogen expect additional industry partners to be announced in the coming months. They expect the first DCC Boiler to be installed and commissioned in Europe in 2023.
Germany received the first blue ammonia shipment from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The 13-metric-ton delivery at the Port of Hamburg was agreed upon during a trip by a German delegation to Abu Dhabi in March. The second delivery will arrive in Hamburg at the beginning of November, with more to follow.
Bakken Energy has signed an MoU with Cummins and Schneider National Carriers to work together on the design of the Heartland Hydrogen Hub to serve the needs of long-haul trucking in the US states of North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Montana.
Centrica will inject hydrogen into its existing gas-peaking plant in Brigg, Lincolnshire, as part of a 12-month project exploring the role of hydrogen in power production. “During the trial, getting underway in Q3 2023, no more than 3% of the gas mix could be hydrogen, increasing to 20% incrementally after the project,” wrote Centrica. The British energy company teamed up with HiiROC, whose technology converts gas into hydrogen and carbon black through a thermal plasma electrolysis process.

(CSI) announced it started mass production of its independently developed inverters for residential, commercial and industrial applications. According to the manufacturer, the devices will have a power output ranging from 5 kW to 125 kW. In June 2021, CSI announced plans to expand its inverter capacity to 3 GW per year.
Panel provider GCL Integration announced it will invest around CNY 8 billion ($1.11 billion) in its 20 GW TOPCon solar cell factory in Wuhu, Anhui Province. It plans to build the manufacturing facility in two 10 GW phases by the end of 2024. This new capacity is also intended to serve the company's 15 GW TOPCon module factory in Hefei, around 100 km northwest from Wuhu.
Polysilicon producer GCL Technologies said its total Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR) cellular silicon capacity recently reached 100,000 MT per year. This capacity was achieved by the 40,000 MT factory in Leshan, Sichuan Province, which reached full capacity this week, and by the facility in Xuzhou, which has a capacity of 60,000 MT. According to the company, FBR-based polysilicon production accounts for more than 10% of China's total polysilicon output.
Panel manufacturer Longi said it shipped mono-crystalline wafer products of more than 60 GW in the first nine months of this year. PV module output in the same period also exceeded 30 GW. The company said it also commissioned a 15 GW cell production line in Xi’an, Shaanxi Province.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/25/huasun-launches-400-w-all-black-heterojunction-solar-module-with-21-96-efficiency/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 25, 2022",Huasun launches 400 W all-black heterojunction solar module with 21.96% efficiency,"Chinese PV module manufacturer Huasun has unveiled a new all-black heterojunction (HJT) solar panel for rooftop applications.
“Recently Huasun’s Himalaya M6 series 120-cell full-black light-weight HJT module gained the TUV certification and is about to be put into mass production,” the company said in a statement. “The module adopts an integrated pure black design, and the fashionable appearance is perfectly integrated with the roof.”
The new product is available in five versions with a power output of 380 W to 400 W and a power conversion efficiency ranging from 20.86% to 21.96%. The open-circuit voltage is between 44.83 V and 46.20 V and the short-circuit current spans from 10.54 A and 10.74 A.
The panel measures 1,755 mm x 1,038 mm x 30 mm and weighs 19.5 kg. It features 120 half-cut monocrystalline PERC cells measuring 166 mm x 83 mm. “The HJT cells have the advantages of low-temperature coefficient, high bifaciality and low PID and LID, while the multiple busbar design reduces the current transmission distance and improves the optical utilization,” the panel maker stated.
The new product can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and also features an IP68 enclosure and black anodized aluminum frame. It has a temperature coefficient of -0.26% per C and its operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
The new product comes with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 88% of the nominal output power.
In July 2021, Huasun said it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.26% for an HJT solar cell — a result confirmed by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin in Germany. Last year, the manufacturer installed 2.7 GW of heterojunction production lines at its factory in Anhui Province.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/25/pv-infolink-forecasts-polysilicon-prices-to-be-halved-by-end-of-2023/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 25, 2022",PV InfoLink forecasts polysilicon prices to be halved by end of 2023,"PV Infolink forecasts polysilicon prices to decrease from around CNY 300 ($36.64, excluding VAT)/kg currently to below CNY 150/kg by the end of 2023, it revealed in a joint webinar with analysts Exawatt and Roth Capital Partners.
Prices are expected to decline gradually in the first half of 2023 and then see a steep decline in the second half of the year. The consulting firm expects polysilicon production capacity to increase from 293 GW earlier this year to around 500 GW by the end of 2022, spiking to 975 GW by the end of 2023. However, “there will likely be a meaningful lag between nameplate and effective capacity,” a company statement reads.
China is likely to remain the world’s largest polysilicon producer for the foreseeable future, with both PV Infolink and Exawatt predicting non-China polysilicon to represent up to 10% of total global capacity. Following the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) in the US, the country is expected to increase polysilicon production. Other countries are also ramping up or starting production, including Norway, Turkey, and Germany. Both firms expect prices for polysilicon from outside of China to be higher by between 5% and 10%.
PV Infolink predicts that it will take between two to three years of operation for new entrants to be competitive with established players like Chinese manufacturers in terms of capacity, yield rate, and purity.
Cell, wafer, and module prices are also predicted to decrease. PV Infolink expects cell pricing to be roughly $0.16/W through 2022 and fall slowly next year to around $0.10/W by year-end. It puts current pricing for a 210 mm mono wafer at around $0.21/W, which could fall to around $0.13/W by end 2023. Module pricing may fall slightly to between $0.22 to $0.23/W at the end of 2023 from the current $0.25 to $0.27.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/25/alpine-vs-urban-solar/,"INSTALLATIONS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,SWITZERLAND",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 25, 2022",Alpine vs. urban solar,"Scientists from several research institutes across Switzerland claim to have demonstrated that alpine PV installations are able to provide a higher market value of the produced electricity compared to solar arrays located in urban environments.
The Swiss group utilized the market value approach, which is a methodology assigning a value to a business based on market forces in comparable situations. They defined the market value as the average market price of photovoltaics per MWh over all hours and measured the financial viability in terms of average panel revenue per kW/year. “We also consider average panel revenue, a measure of the financial viability of new capacities (€/kW/year),” it further explained. “To this end, we couple two complementary numerical models to explore economically viable placements of PV, both allowing and forbidding alpine locations.”
They also defined two models to identify the optimized values for PV installation location and corresponding financial viability in Switzerland: the Optimized Renewable Energy by Evolution Strategy (OREES), which allows simultaneous optimization of the placement and the share of renewable electricity generation technologies that are to be added to a system; and the Swissmod, which is a bottom-up electricity market model for Switzerland that includes a detailed electricity network and hydropower representation.
They used the models to compare two main optimization scenarios, for alpine and non-alpine locations, respectively, against a control, urban PV installation scenario.
The alpine scenario includes locations that are lower than 2,700 meters above sea level, at least 150 meters away from slopes steeper than 30 degrees, and within 500 meters of a road. North-facing slopes were excluded, with a total of 600 km2 of land being considered suitable for optimized alpine installations. For the non-alpine scenario, the elevation limit was lowered to 800 meters above sea level, reducing the PV potential area to 450 km2.
Their analysis showed that the altitude constraint that limits the scenarios has a strong impact on the economic performance of the panels, which means that the higher the PV system is located, the better it is for its revenue generation. Both the alpine and the non-alpine scenarios showed higher market values than the urban, low-altitude, PV scenario.
The findings also revealed that placing photovoltaic installations in alpine areas would increase the market value of the produced electricity the most. For example, comparing the scenarios for the year 2040, the control scenario has a market value of €76.84 ($75.36)/kW/year; the non-alpine €83.83/kW/year; and the alpine €93.73/kW/year. That means that the alpine scenario is 21.98% and 11.8% more financially viable than the control and non-alpine scenarios, respectively. On average, the modeled alpine PV installations offer revenues that are on average 20% higher than those of urban installations.
The scientists also found that the Swiss Alps offer the highest market values, with the first 1 GW of potential installed capacity offering revenues 33% higher than the standard scenario. “PV panels located in the Alps can produce much more electricity in winter than anywhere else in Switzerland. Higher solar radiation and higher ground reflection from snow can be exploited with steeper installations geometry to maximize winter production,” the scientist said.
They recently presented their findings in the article “Optimized market value of alpine solar photovoltaic installations,” published in the journal Renewable Energy. The research group includes academics from the University of Basel, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), the Centre for Energy Policy and Economics (CEPE), and ZHAW School of Management and Law.

Gurugram-based solar startup Su-vastika has launched a lithium battery-based three-phase uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system that can be widely used as an alternative to polluting diesel generators (DGs), from residential and commercial buildings to educational facilities, hospitals and shopping malls.
The UPS system is available with power ratings of 10 kVA to 500 kVA and is able to work on a bi-directional technology based on an insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT).
The company claims the UPS system's running cost is 75% less than DG sets. The batteries are based on lithium ferro phosphate technology and can be recharged to 100% in four hours, according to the manufacturer.
The system also uses advanced static switches that reportedly reduce switching time to between 2 m and 5 m, which is fast enough to prevent a computer and the majority of sensitive equipment from resetting.
The backup time provided by the UPS system can be extended by using solar power in conjunction with the battery bank. “The heavy-duty UPS by Su-vastika are a far superior alternative to DG sets due to their high-capacity energy storage, fast switching technology, negligible maintenance cost, long-lasting batteries, and capability to protect machinery and appliances during power surges,” stated the company.
“The UPS systems have Wi-Fi and GSM connectivity (optional). Our application will monitor your UPS and send regular reports to Su-vastika technicians. In case of any issues, an automatic alert will be sent, and a service call will be made,” it added. The company’s online monitoring system also keeps track of the battery bank usage and sends an alert when the replacement of the battery bank is required.

Both particles are embedded in anti-reflection polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer applied on the frontside of the cell to convert ultraviolet (UV) to visible light and increase the total transmittance of ARC film, thus raising the efficiency of the solar cell itself.
The SiO2 nanoparticles have a spherical shape and are used to improve light scattering affected by the presence of phosphors. This combination helps reduce light reflectance by increasing the diffuse transmittance.
The scientists said their cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.5%, which compares to 22.48% in a reference cell without the ARC.
“Moreover, the PCE of the device with the ARC film was sustained for 120 hours, maintaining 91% of its initial value, while the PCE of existing devices dropped to 90% of its initial efficiency after five hours, and then decreased to 50% after 20 hours,” they stated. “In addition, the initial efficiency of the solar cell has also increased by nearly 4.5% compared to the previous one.”
They presented the coating technology in the study “Improving Light Absorption in a Perovskite/Si Tandem Solar Cell via Light Scattering and UV-Down Shifting by a Mixture of SiO2 Nanoparticles and Phosphors,” published in Advanced Energy Materials.

OCI said this expansion plan will require an investment of around $40 million.
Mission Solar Energy is aiming to start commercial operations of its new production lines by the end of 2023. The manufacturing facility, which currently produces only panels for residential applications, will also manufacture M10 solar panels for commercial and large-scale projects.
“OCI plans to preemptively respond to the growth of the US solar market, which is expected to see increasing demand thanks to the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA),” the Korean company said in a statement. “OCI wants to actively respond to the growing demand for modules in the US by expanding its facility and establishing a stable supply chain by procuring polysilicon at its Malaysian plant.”
OCI added that it also wanted to expand its downstream business in the US solar market, which it entered in 2012 by constructing the Alamo Project, the world's largest solar power plant at the time. The company said it was currently developing a total of five solar power generation projects and one storage facility in Texas through its US subsidiary, OCI Solar Power.
OCIM Sdn Bhd (OCIMSB), the Malaysian unit of OCI, is currently operating a 35,000 MT polysilicon factory in the Samalaju Industrial Park in Sarawak, Malaysia. The group's total annual polysilicon output – including its 3,000-MT factory in Gunsan, South Korea – amounts to 38,000 MT. The company shut down its second Korean plant in Gunsan in February 2020 due to downward price pressure in the South Korean polysilicon industry.
