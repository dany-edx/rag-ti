Industry body the Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanREA) has welcomed the findings of the North American Renewable Integration Study (NARIS), and pointed out the government has raised its climate change ambition since the modeling exercise was started, three years ago.
With the NARIS study – carried out by Natural Resources Canada, the United States Department of Energy and the Secretaría de Energía de México – having made its solar prediction based on an 80% reduction in carbon emissions across the three nations' energy systems by mid century, CanREA has pointed out Ottawa and the U.S. have since pledged to attain net zero economies by 2050, with Canada aiming to eliminate carbon from its energy system by that point and the U.S. promising to do so by 2035.
The NARIS findings modeled by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory predicted the route to an 80% carbon free energy system in Canada would require 7-32 GW of rooftop solar, depending on the scenario mapped in an exercise which examined four broad outcomes plus 38 variations.
The Canadian industry body, which welcomed the findings of the study on its website yesterday, used the occasion to call on the federal government to ramp up the roll-out of solar and wind generation capacity and improve electricity network links between the nation's provinces.

The engineering, procurement and financing phases are expected to take at least three years. The construction and commissioning phases are predicted to take five years. “The green hydrogen facilities will lift Kazakhstan among the global leaders of renewable energy and hydrogen at very competitive, ultra-low production costs. We trust that, for green hydrogen, Kazakhstan is the place to be,” commented Svevind’s majority owner and CEO Wolfgang Kropp.
Norwegian state-owned oil and gas company Equinor said on Tuesday it tripled its U.K. low carbon hydrogen production ambitions to 1.8 GW. “Without CCS and hydrogen, at scale, there is no viable path to net zero and realizing the Paris goals … The projects will also contribute to provide hydrogen and low carbon solutions to 3-5 industrial clusters by 2035. We will do so by working together with governments, partners and customers,” said Equinor’s president and chief executive officer, Anders Opedal, after a Monday meeting with U.K. energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng and Norway’s energy minister, Tina Bru. The increased hydrogen goal is principally related to low carbon hydrogen supplies to the Keadby Hydrogen power station which Equinor is co-developing with the SSE Thermal unit of Australian-owned British utility SSE. According to Equinor, the power station could come online before 2030, potentially becoming the world’s first large scale 100% hydrogen-fueled power station. The U.K. has a target to reach 5 GW of clean hydrogen capacity by 2030.
Aker Clean Hydrogen, a hydrogen-focused arm of Norway’s Aker group, has invested in Meraker Hydrogen, resulting in 20% ownership of the company. “The aim of the investment is to accelerate the development of green hydrogen production in mid-Norway and decarbonize local transportation and industry,” read a note released last week. The company intends to build a plant in Meråker municipality, to produce up to 10 tons of green hydrogen per day – equivalent to 23 MW of installed electrolyzer capacity – using local renewable energy sources. Production start is expected early in 2024. “Meraker Hydrogen is well positioned to create green value chains and decarbonize local shipping and transportation sectors in addition to other potential industry [uses],” Knut Nyborg, chief executive officer of Aker Clean Hydrogen, commented.
Saga Pure, the first listed green investment company on the Oslo Stock Exchange, has announced the acquisition of Hyon, a maritime hydrogen solutions provider. Following a subsequent transaction, Saga Pure, Nel ASA and Norwegian Hydrogen will each have 29% ownership of Hyon, with key employees holding the remaining shares. Hyon will focus on developing hydrogen and ‘bunkering solutions' for harbors. “Sustainability is at the top of the agenda within the maritime sector and hydrogen will play an important role in the future maritime fuel mix. An entirely new value chain needs to be developed and a key part of that is transferring hydrogen from the harbors to the vessels. Hyon is currently developing solutions for [the] production and fueling of hydrogen ships and we look forward to be[ing] an active part of the further development of these solutions,” Bjørn Simonsen, CEO of Saga Pure, commented in a note released on Tuesday.
Ways2H, a joint venture between U.S.-based Clean Energy Enterprises and Japan Blue Energy, will deliver facilities that convert garbage into hydrogen to U.K.-based Element 2. The facilities will supply Element 2’s network of hydrogen refueling stations as part of a cooperation on the production and distribution of renewable hydrogen fuel for transport in the U.K., Ireland and continental Europe. The two companies envision as many as 40 sites that could each provide from 500kg to a ton per day of renewable hydrogen fuel. The first project should take place in Scotland. “Our hydrogen supply agreement with Ways2H is an important step in Element 2’s plan to deliver 2,000 hydrogen refueling stations across the U.K., Ireland and Europe by 2030,” Element 2 CEO Tim Harper commented, in a note released last week. Ways2H recycles municipal solid waste and sewage sludge, converting them into a gas from which pure hydrogen is then extracted. The company recently completed its waste-to-hydrogen facility in Tokyo.
Canada is stepping up its efforts to promote hydrogen-powered electric vehicles. After Alberta, British Columbia is now bracing to invest in hydrogen-powered heavy-duty transportation. The province’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) offered service provider Hydra Energy a $1.9 million (US$1.54 million) credit to build a hydrogen fueling station in the northeastern part of the province by early 2023. According to the plans, 65 diesel trucks will be retrofitted to use 40% hydrogen fuel which will be captured at a local sodium-chlorate facility. “By working with hydrogen suppliers and the trucking industry, we’re hauling B.C. toward a low-carbon future. Hydrogen fuels allow us to reduce emissions in our transportation sector,” Bruce Ralston, minister of energy, mines and low carbon innovation, commented in a note released on Monday. British Columbia is set to present its hydrogen strategy, which aims to make the province the “world leader in the production, use and export of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen.”

The M6 (166mm) and G1 (158.75mm) products will be sold for at RMB4.72 (US$0.731) and RMB4.62 (US$0.715), respectively, marking a RMB0.41 (US$0.063) reduction for each.
Manufacturer Golden Glass is planning to set up a 1.2 GW heterojunction cell and module production line in the Wujiang district of Suzhou City in Jiangsu province. The company wants to invest RMB832 million (US$129 million) in the factory and to start construction “soon,” with completion being scheduled within eight months. Manufacturing is expected to start by the end of February. Golden Glass said the new lines will be highly automated and compatible with large wafers, including 182mm and 210mm products.
Module maker Trina Solar has joined forces with energy company China Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec) to reduce the carbon footprint of Sinopec's gas stations. The partners plan to deploy distributed PV, energy storage and green hydrogen facilities at the gas stations after a pilot project was developed at a Sinopec station in Jiangsu province. That facility can generate 140 MWh of clean power annually and can sell excess electricity to the grid.

The lake covers an area of 8.89km2, is up to 4.4km long, and 18m deep. According to the company's executive director, Nikola Rovčanin, the deployment of the plant will not raise any legal dispute as it will be located on a water surface owned by EPCG and will not consume agricultural land.
The project will also be in line with the technical guidelines of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), to mitigate the impact of renewable energy sources on biodiversity.
Rovčanin added that some unnamed Danish companies are interested in developing the project, without providing further details.
EPGC and Finnish utility Fortum are currently building a 100 MW ground-mounted solar plant in Montenegro. The facility, located in the southernmost and sunniest part of the country, will sell power to the local grid under a long-term PPA.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country had installed solar power of just 6 MW at the end of 2020. The vast majority of Montenegro’s electrical power demand is currently met by the 225 MW Pljevlja thermal power plant in the north of Montenegro, and two large hydropower plants, at Perućica (307 MW) and Piva (363 MW).

Revolt Energy Green, a French lighting and electrical distribution equipment specialist, is leasing solar kits with capacities ranging from 4.3 kW to 30 kW, in multiple configurations.
The 4.3 kW arrays can be deployed with 15 kWh energy storage systems.
“It can be installed with a modular approach on maritime containers or containers for construction sites,” CEO Fabrice Lefebvre told pv magazine. “It allows the production of energy for self-consumption and in total autonomy.”
For mobile solutions, the company offers solar trailers with capacities up to 5.25 kW, linked to 23 kWh batteries. The plug-and-play solution, which can also be equipped with remote monitoring, can be adapted to different construction sites.
The company's largest and most powerful solution is a semi-mobile 74 kW solar system with a 153 kWh energy storage unit.
“This can be used, for example, for one-off events, such as festivals that take place outside large cities,” said Lefebvre.
The entire range is equipped with solar panels from France's Voltec Solar, while minigrid specialist Ecosun has agreed to handle the integration of the mobile systems. Germany's Victron Energy supplies the converters, solar charge controllers and battery management systems.
Revolt Energy Green's first customers have included recreational centers, music festivals, and French telecoms group Orange, which uses the solar+storage systems to provide power for its antennas.
It has also developed an electricity generator that runs on hydrogen to replace fossil fuel power generators. Developed in cooperation with startup H2Sys, the system includes a 3 kW fuel cell.
“For now, they are filled with blue hydrogen, but our ultimate goal is to move to a green hydrogen supplier,” said Lefebvre.

Jinko wants to list its main business, Jinko Solar Co Ltd, on the exchange in a RMB6 billion (US$929 million) initial public offering (IPO) and devote RMB4 billion of the receipts towards the RMB5.6 billion (US$867 million) cost of a factory in Haining able to produce 7.5 GW of cells per year and/or 5 GW of modules, the company announced yesterday.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
The Chinese business said it would invest RMB500 million (US$77.4 million) towards a RMB750 million R&D center at the site and expected to bank a further RMB1.5 billion from the listing, which will see its stake in the unit diluted from around 73% to almost 55%, and possibly further, in the event of an over-allotment option being exercised beyond the planned 2.67 billion shares issuance.
Jinko has trailed the plans since September.
Sino-Canadian company Canadian Solar had planned the IPO of its CSI Solar Co Ltd manufacturing and Chinese solar project operation for even longer, having announced the plan in July and raised US$260 million towards the costs in the third quarter of last year plus a further US$230 million by issuing convertible bonds.
Canadian, which in November said the Shanghai float would be complete this quarter – giving it until close of play tomorrow to stay on track – was less specific about how much the IPO could be expected to raise and what the proceeds would be spent on.
The company said yesterday: “The proceeds of the offering, which are subject to the actual size and pricing of the offering, will be used to strengthen CSI Solar and the company's market leadership position by investing in capacity expansion across the solar value chain, research and development, and additional working capital for CSI Solar.”
A press release about the IPO added the plan is to issue around 541 million shares, plus any over-allotment, diluting Canadian Solar's holding in the business from around 80% to around 64%.
The Nasdaq-listed company reportedly settled on the Shanghai market after initially also considering the merits of the Shenzhen exchange's ChiNext board and high-profile CEO Shawn Qu has said the China listing will give his company access to cheaper capital.

The solar project is part of the Rijnlandroute project under development by French construction conglomerate Vinci. It includes the construction of the new road and a 2.2km tunnel segment, as well as the widening of motorway sections totaling 12km in length, and several adjustments on the two motorways.
The solar plant will rely on 4,600 photovoltaic modules with a size of 2m2 each and which will have an east-west orientation. The local government explained that floating PV was chosen as it allows to deploy more panels on a limited space as there is a minimal distance between the module rows. “The advantage here is that the panels are placed low and out of sight in the landscape as much as possible,” it said in a statement.
The PV system will be linked to an unspecified type of flow battery. The power stored in it should be used to power the tunnel at night. “The N434 will consume approximately 2,000,000 kWh of electricity annually, for ventilation, lighting and other installations in the tunnel,” the regional government stated. “One of the other innovations used to save energy is the lighting of the tunnel entrances with solar fiber-optic lenses that collect light and rotate with the sun.”
Several solar power projects are currently being planned or built along, or close to Dutch motorways. Four large scale facilities are being developed close to on-ramps and off-ramps of the A7 highway, which connects Zaandam, in the province of North Holland, to the German border.
Furthermore, Rijkswaterstaat – the water management agency of the Netherlands, under the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management – is planning to build a large scale solar plant along Highway 35 in the northeastern Netherlands, and a solar park along the A37 in Drenthe province. Shell also plans to install 48 MW of solar capacity near Rijksweg 59, a highway that spans the provinces of Zeeland, South Holland and North Brabant.

“In this new form of energy transfer, called power by light, the laser energy is delivered either through the air or via an optical fiber to a photovoltaic cell whose properties match the power and the wavelength of the monochromatic laser light,” the scientists explained. “Compared to conventional power transmission via copper wires, power by light systems are especially beneficial for applications which require a galvanically isolated power supply, lightning or explosion protection, electromagnetic compatibility, or completely wireless power transmission, for example.”
Laser energy transmission systems are not very different from energy transmission systems based on microwave technology. These systems convert the power source into an emitter that generates a directional electromagnetic radiation, which is subsequently absorbed in a receiver. The latter can then convert this energy into electricity, heat, or hydrogen. These systems can be used for the monitoring of wind turbines and high-voltage lines, as well as fuel sensors in aircraft tanks and passive optical networks, among other things.
The cell was built with layers grown on gallium arsenide substrate, which was then subsequently removed, and a highly reflective mirror applied to the back surface of the ultra-thin remaining semiconductor structure. The reflector was optically optimized through a combination of ceramic and silver and the cell's absorber was based on nitrogen-doped gallium arsenide and p-type aluminum gallium arsenide.
“This thin film approach has two distinct advantages for the efficiency,” explained the head of the Fraunhofer ISE research team, Henning Helmers. “First of all, photons are trapped in the cell and the absorption is maximized for photon energies close to the bandgap, which simultaneously minimizes thermalization and transmission losses, making the cell more efficient. Secondly, the photons additionally generated internally by radiative recombination become trapped and effectively recycled. This extends the effective carrier lifetime, thus additionally increasing the voltage.”
Other Fraunhofer ISE researchers achieved in April a 35.9% conversion efficiency for a III-V monolithic triple-junction solar cell based on silicon. In August 2020, the research institute announced a 25.9% conversion efficiency rate for a III-V tandem solar cell grown directly on silicon. This cell is a modified version of a 34.5%-efficient III-V solar cell that is manufactured through a process known as direct wafer bonding, where the III-V layers are first deposited on an aluminum gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate and then pressed together.
Researchers at the Tampere University in Finland have recently developed a III-V multi-junction solar cell which is claimed to have the potential for reaching a power conversion efficiency of close to 50%. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the United States announced last year a 32.9% efficiency for a tandem cell device utilizing III-V materials.

State-run power producer NTPC has kicked off an expression of interest (EoI) among Indian and global companies to set up 1 GWh of grid-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) at its power plants in India.
The BESS could be deployed at a single location or could be split across multiple NTPC power plants. The applicants identified through the EoI will be asked to submit proposals.
NTPC produces around 300 billion units of electricity annually through its more than 65 GW of capacity. Its operations include gas, coal, hydro and renewables-based power stations across the country. It plans to reach an installed power generation capacity of 130 GW by 2032, with 60 GW from renewables.
It will increasingly be required to operate its conventional fleet flexibly to support the grid, as the penetration of variable renewable energy increases in India’s power system. NTPC is looking to deploy grid-scale BESS in cooperation with POSOCO, a unit of Powergrid Corp. of India, and the Ministry of Power.
The aim is to provide the Indian grid with flexible storage systems, test NTPC’s ability to integrate BESS into its future operational regime, and simultaneously extend such facilities for ancillary operations by POSOCO to enhance grid reliability.
The BESS could be deployed along with thermal/renewables generators for several different applications. It could be used to store surplus energy during low demand periods and supply stored energy during peak demand hours. It could also be designed to supplement thermal generation in meeting statutory ramp-up and ramp-down requirements, provide ancillary services in line with grid requirements, and minimize unscheduled interchange (UI) and optimize UI returns.

Australia’s only solar PV module manufacturer, Tindo Solar, has secured AUD 1 million ($755,300) in federal government funding, which will help it to transition to new M10 cell technology and boost production capacity with a new manufacturing facility in Adelaide nearing completion.
Tindo Solar CEO Shayne Jaenisch said on Monday the AUD 1 million grant, announced as part of a AUD 55 million package awarded under round two of the Manufacturing Modernisation Fund (MMF), would allow the company to compete on equal footing with the world’s biggest module manufacturers.
“We’re looking forward to being able to take the next step,” Jaenisch told pv magazine. “It allows us to compete at the front end of technology. Once we bring the new line into production in January I think we’ll be able to compete with the top 10% of manufacturers globally in performance. We’ve always had the quality. Now we’ve got to that point where we can compete head on with some of the biggest manufacturers around the world.”
The cash injection marks the first funds the company has received from any level of government. Tindo Solar has been manufacturing solar PV modules at its Mawson Lakes facility in Adelaide’s northern suburbs for more than a decade. But the company recently announced expansion plans to allow it to satisfy growing demand for its Australian-made modules.
The new plant will boost the company’s production capacity to 150 MW per annum. It will see Tindo Solar transition to the latest M10 cell technology. Jaenisch said a 144-cell 550 W module  will be among the first modules to roll off the new line.
Tindo Solar is one of 86 businesses across Australia to share in the latest round of MMF grants. Sun Cable, the Singaporean consortium behind the AUD 26 billion Australia-ASEAN Power Link (AAPL), also recently secured a AUD 1 million grant under round two of the MMF to progress its plans to develop a proposed solar array manufacturing assembly facility in Darwin.
Earlier this year, Sun Cable announced plans to construct a facility to manufacture the prefabricated, pre-wired Maverick solar systems, designed by Sydney-based manufacturer 5B. The system has been selected as the module of choice for the AAPL project – a 14 GW solar farm and approximately 33 GWh battery energy storage system to be constructed in the Northern Territory’s Barkly Region.
Sun Cable said the first stage of the proposed manufacturing facility will pilot a semi-automated production line, which will provide opportunities to supply other solar farms across northern Australia with the Maverick solar array systems. Phase two of the development will expand the facility to manufacture systems for the AAPL project.
Sydney-based E3Sixty was also included in the list of MMF grant recipients, securing $469,950 to help finance a AUD 1.9 million e-waste recycling facility in the city’s western suburbs. E3Sixty Solar, which incorporates PV Industries, recently secured a site in Auburn, where it has already commenced a solar module recycling operation.
Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Christian Porter said the MMF, part of the government’s AUD 1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy, is designed to help business to modernise their manufacturing processes, improve productivity and target new export opportunities. Businesses are required to match government funding on a three-to-one basis, with government grants covering up to 25% of eligible project expenditure.
The minimum grant amount is AUD 100,000 and the maximum grant amount is AUD 1 million. Projects must be completed within two years.
“Australia’s manufacturing sector is vitally important to our economy, directly employing more than 900,000 Australian workers and contributing almost $120 billion to our export earnings last year,” Porter said. “Investing in the latest manufacturing technology and equipment helps them to remain internationally competitive by improving their productivity and increasing their capacity to target new export markets for their products. Just as importantly, these investments also help to grow well-paid and highly skilled jobs in the modern manufacturing sector for Australian workers. We know that for every manufacturing job we create, at least three additional jobs are created in other areas of our economy.”

Increasing renewable generation up to 90% by 2050 in the contiguous United States would yield lower system costs than maintaining the current generation mix, according to a new research paper published in Joule.
Those lower system costs do not count public health, environmental, or climate benefits from the increased use of renewables, say the study’s eight co-authors. Seven of the authors are with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
Assuming no new federal or state policies beyond those in effect as of June 2020, the least-cost system would reach 57% renewables by 2050, with average levelized costs of $30/MWh, or 3 cents per kWh. Moderately higher system costs of $36/MWh would result from a requirement to reach 90% renewables a decade earlier, in 2040. Reaching 100% renewables by 2050 would be possible with existing technologies, yielding costs of $39/MWh, the study said.
The results are largely driven by the use of updated cost projections for utility-scale solar from NREL’s 2020 Annual Technology Baseline. Those projections were well below the prior year’s projections. The “moderate” cost projections used in the study showed a cost of about $24/MWh for utility-scale solar in 2030, versus the prior year’s projection of about $38/MWh in 2030. The study found that incremental costs of the system would rise steeply for the last few percentage points of renewable generation, as the system approaches 100% renewables.
Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University energy researcher, said in a LinkedIn comment that annual costs would be reduced even more compared to fossil fuels by “including electrification of transport, buildings and industry; eliminating energy in mining and refining fossil fuels and uranium; and accounting for demand response and heat/cold storage.” He cited a new Stanford study for each of the 50 states presenting those results.
Jacobson said that in 2009, when his team first published modeling of 100% renewables, “utilities claimed that 20% renewables on the grid was infeasible,” and that in 2015, “critics claimed that 80% was infeasible.” With the new NREL study, he said, “their claims are now debunked.”
Modeling methods
The NREL study found that reaching high renewables levels sooner than 2050 would cost more for three reasons. First, because the study discounted costs at 5% per year, costs incurred earlier had a higher discounted cost. Second, capital costs for renewables were expected to continue declining through 2050, yielding lower costs for later deployment. Third, retiring fossil generators before they were fully paid for was modeled as “resulting in additional costs from stranded assets.”
To model its base case results, the study used mid-range assumptions for capital and operating costs of generators, and for electricity demand. The research team used NREL’s ReEDS model for capacity expansion analysis, and the commercial PLEXOS model for production cost modeling. Scenarios were run on NREL’s high performance computer.
To ensure resource adequacy, the study team modeled seasonal firm capacity requirements equivalent to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation reference reserve margin levels.
The study also considered 22 additional sets of assumptions, including low costs for renewables and batteries; a near-doubling of electricity demand due to electrification with 34% of total demand available as flexible resources; or no new transmission. These other sets of assumptions were modeled only with the ReEDS model.
