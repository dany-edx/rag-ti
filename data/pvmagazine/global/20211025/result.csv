Dubbed IQ8, the 97%-efficient device is said to be the most powerful microinverter developed by the company to date and is capable of forming a microgrid during a power outage by relying exclusively on PV power and, simultaneously, to provide backup power without the need for battery storage.
“Since the company’s inception, we invested in custom application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips for our microinverters, and today we see the payoff with a software-defined microinverter smart enough to form a microgrid, unlocking value for homeowners,” said Enphase CEO, Badri Kothandaraman.
The micro-inverter is available in four versions: the “Solar Only” product, which a standard grid-tied system with no battery included; the “Sunlight Backup” device with no battery but with a grid-agnostic configuration; the “Home Essentials Backup” solution with the same grid-agnostic configuration of the second product and a small battery; and the “Full Energy Independence” with a large battery and the grid-agnostic approach.
“For homeowners who want a battery, there are no sizing restrictions on pairing an Enphase battery with the solar system,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “And all configurations can be customized for homeowners with the help of Enphase installer partners.”
All three devices with the so-called grid-agnostic configuration must be equipped with an Enphase System Controller to isolate the home during a blackout.
“The IQ8 family includes five types of software-defined microinverters, IQ8, IQ8+, IQ8M, IQ8A and IQ8H, with peak output AC power of 245VA, 300VA, 330VA, 366VA and 384VA, respectively,” the company specified. “The multiple types of IQ8 enable seamless pairing with a full range of solar modules, even up to 540W DC.”
The manufacturer added it will ship the first products in North America in December.

These storage systems have a combined capacity of 251.9 MW and a maximum storage capacity of 404.9 MWh. This compares to 115.9 MW/186.3 MWh of distributed storage capacity at the end of December 2019 and 189.5 MW/295.6 MWh at the end of 2020.
The newly installed capacity for the first six months this year was 59.9 MW/106.58 MWh, which represents the strongest six-month period ever recorded in the country for storage deployment to date. For comparison, in full-year 2020 newly deployed distributed storage capacity was 73.7MW/106.5 MWh.
According to the new figures, most of the devices – 48,904 for a total capacity of 246.0 MW/319.5 MWh – are based on lithium-ion technologies, with the remaining share represented by lead batteries and other technologies.
Most of the storage systems are deployed in the region of Lombardy – some 14,379 units with a combined capacity of 62.9 MW/107.2 MWh.
The regional government is implementing a multi-year rebate scheme for residential and commercial storage systems coupled with PV and in September it allocated another €20 million in rebates.
The Veneto region, which is also supporting distributed storage deployment through an ad hoc scheme, has the second-largest volume of storage capacity, at 38.6 MW/67.6 MWh.

The project was financed by South Africa-based equity investor Inspired Evolution, the U.K. government-funded Renewable Energy Performance Platform (REPP), and Gigawatt Global itself, while the construction loans were refinanced by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC).
Additional direct and indirect financial support was provided by the Energy and Environment Partnership (EEP) set up by Finland, the U.K., and Austria, as well as by the Belgian Investment Company for Developing Countries (BIO).
The US$14 million installation is located near the village of Mubuga, in the Gitega Province, and has increased Burundi’s total generation capacity by over 10%. The electricity generated at the site will be sold to the country’s national electric company, REGIDESO, under a 25-year power purchase agreement.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Burundi had an installed solar power of around 5 MW at the end of 2020. The country's current total power generation capacity is around 108 MW, of which 48 MW comes from hydropower and 51 MW from conventional power plants.
Access to electricity in the Sub-Saharan country is among the lowest in the world at around 11% and access to clean cooking is less than 5%.

Renewable-energy powered green hydrogen will be used to form the e-ammonia ‘powerfuel‘ which will contribute 60% of shipping's mid-century decarbonization effort, under IRENA's pathway to a world that will see global heating this century capped at 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Such a fuel transition will require 866-1,299 GW of global solar generation capacity by 2050, according to IRENA, from a projected global clean energy generation capacity of 2,799 GW.
Pick up your copy of the latest edition of pv magazine for an in-depth look at the fire hazard concern of lithium-ion battery systems, with a focus on the blaze at Australia’s Victorian Big Battery which caught the world’s attention. Also, Saul Griffith, the guru of electrification, talks to pv magazine about reshaping the climate conversation; we delve into the evolution of residential PV in China; and we continue our coverage of global PV supply-chain issues and ask: Is there an alternative to Made in China?
A Pathway to Decarbonise the Shipping Sector by 2050, a report recently published by the UAE-based international body, notes the crucial role that could be played by Morocco in achieving zero-carbon shipping, given the nation's vast renewable energy potential and strategic location, with access to the Atlantic and Mediterranean sea lanes.
The 116-page report lists the policies required to support a sector that, in 2018, contributed around 3% of global carbon emissions and is outside national climate change regulations. The suggestions included identifying the world's most promising renewable energy generation sites and establishing a shipping industry body to coordinate renewables plant development in such zones with national governments, to feed a raised appetite for the clean power needed to produce green hydrogen and, indirectly, e-ammonia.
With global trade body the International Chamber of Shipping having last month proposed a carbon levy per ton of carbon and equivalents emitted by tankers with a gross tonnage of more than 5,000 tons, the IRENA report also noted the vital need for a realistic carbon levy to level the playing field for sustainable fuels against fossil fuel-based alternatives.
The study estimated e-ammonia costs will fall from around US$143-219/MWh today to around $67-114/MWH by mid-century and predicted ‘blue ammonia' – requiring the use of nitrogen and natural gas-plus-carbon-capture powered ‘blue hydrogen‘ – is likely to play a “transitional role.” However, over-expanding natural gas-powered shipping options runs the risk of stranding such assets further down the line, the report warned.
If IRENA's expectations are borne out, the sector will require 46 million tons of green hydrogen in mid-century, of which 73% will power e-ammonia, 17% e-methanol, and of which 10% will be used directly to power vessels, probably on shorter, domestic shipping routes.
The report stressed the need for global policymakers to act now to expand the storage and refueling options at key ports such as Singapore; Fujairah, in the UAE; and Rotterdam, in the Netherlands; as well as at shipping ‘pinch points' in the Panama and Suez canals and the Straits of Malacca, because large and very large vessels have an operational life of 25-30 years.
IRENA estimated commercial e-ammonia vessels will be operational in 2023 and noted a project by Finnish company Wärtsilä and Norwegian business Grieg Edge which is aiming to develop the world's first greenhouse gas-free renewable ammonia-powered tanker by 2024, with the help of $5.34 million from the Norwegian government.

Canada-based Solarmass Energy Group is seeking to commercialize its Ergosun solar tile in Europe. The company is currently in talks with product distributors and installers from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.
The manufacturer said the current load per solar cell of the tile has recently been optimized, which has helped increase its overall efficiency to 19.22%.
According to the product sheet, the solar tile is available in charcoal and terracotta and has a size of 298×335 mm. Its power output is 15 W and the power temperature coefficient is -0.35% per degree Celsius. The open-circuit voltage is 12.0 V and the short-circuit current is 1.55 A.
“With a matte finish, the tiles reflect less light, enabling more light to be converted to power both in low light conditions and with non-optimal orientation when compared with conventional solar panels,” the Canadian company said. “Whether building from new or retrofit, the system can be designed with no need for holes through the building envelope.”
A bypass diode embedded in the solar tile is intended to prevent the reduced output power of one module from affecting that of other modules. Solarmass offers a 10-year product guarantee and a 25-year performance guarantee.

A 3.5 kW PV system has been deployed across the entire roof surface of an 18-ton electric truck produced by German specialist Framo GmbH. It will now be tested for one year in the surrounding area of Freiburg by German technology company Alexander Bürkle GmbH.
Readings will be made via the IVImon mode, which has also been developed by the Fraunhofer ISE and will provide relevant data of the battery storage units used in electric vehicles. The PV system is connected to the 800-volt traction battery embedded in the truck and is reportedly able to cover between 5-10% of the vehicle's electricity demand, depending on location.
Designed by Fraunhofer ISE scientists, the solar modules were manufactured by Germany-based Sunset Energietechnik GmbH and installed on the truck's roof by vehicle cooling system provider TBV Kühlfahrzeuge GmbH. “To ensure that the electricity yields are high and the material and cabling costs are low, the solar modules in the truck roof are connected in series,” the Fraunhofer ISE said in a statement. “The resulting high voltages of up to 400 volts could pose a safety risk in the event of an accident.”

The research group placed a separation device in each of the solar modules' junction boxes. It claims this device is able to disconnect the panels within milliseconds in the case of an accident. Furthermore, partner companies M&P Motion Control and Power Electronics GmbH equipped the panels with a DC power controller that communicates with the vehicle control system via a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus – a message-based protocol designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate in common automobiles.
“This truck, the first equipped with these PV modules, has now passed the technical inspection, marking a milestone towards more climate-friendly road freight transport,” the German research institute said, without providing further details on the tested technology.
In a recent interview with pv magazine, Bonna Newman, program manager for PV and Mobility, Module Technologies at the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), said that electric cars incorporating PV modules on their bodywork or roof have the potential to reach more than 10,000 km per year of pure solar-powered driving and that the modules could have a payback time of just three to four years. According to her, the benefits of vehicle-integrated PV are proportional to the solar radiation levels of a given area, its demand for electric vehicles, and power prices.
Germany's Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin (ISFH) is currently developing a light commercial vehicle prototype equipped with vehicle-integrated photovoltaics (VIPV). The researchers have built the prototype based on the “Work L” small truck, which is manufactured by Germany-based StreetScooter GmbH. The vehicles feature a total area of 15 m2 on which 10 PV modules can be deployed.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/25/flowable-silicone-sealant-to-repair-damaged-solar-module-backsheets/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BELGIUM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 25, 2021",Flowable silicone sealant to repair damaged solar module backsheets,"An Austrian-Belgian research group has developed a flowable silicone sealant that can be used to create an insulating and protective layer on damaged solar module backsheets.
The scientists used a special sealant that is known as Dowsil 7094 Flowable Sealant and which is produced by U.S.-based silicone adhesives and sealants provider Dow Corning. This black sealant is usually utilized as a paste for solar panel frame sealing, but the research team decided to make it flowable and use it as a repair material. The latter is described as consisting of a mixture of calcium carbonate particles acting as a filler, and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer that cures the damaged backsheet upon exposure to ambient moisture.
“The moisture cure system results in an inward directed curing process starting from the surface in contact with air, with the cure rate slowing down as the barrier for moisture diffusion becomes wider,” the academics stated. “After cure, the material is a solid elastomer with a high elongation at break, which develops good adhesion to backsheet materials.”
The sealant was initially tested on four backsheet material types: one based on co-extruded polyamide; a product made of polyvinyl fluoride (PVF) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET); another one based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and PET; and a primer-based product made with PET.
The sealant was applied onto the air side of 2.5cm wide and 10cm long rectangular strips cut out from the four backsheets. “Then, a second strip, air side down, was placed on top of the first one and pressed so that the silicone material between the two backsheet strips had a thickness of about 1mm,” the group further explained. “The excess silicone material was removed from the side, and the samples were left to cure at 23 degrees Celsius [and] 50% relative humidity for 28 days.” The cured samples were then put into a climate chamber at 85 degrees Celsius and 85% relative humidity for 1,000 hours.
The new solution was found to offer good adhesion for all the selected materials, with 100% cohesive failure on all types.
The flowable sealant was then tested on solar modules based on an AAA backsheet that were damaged by deep longitudinal cracks and have operated for around seven years. The sealant was used to fill the cracks, and then spread with a spatula into a uniform flat layer over the backsheet surface. The repaired panels were also placed into a climate chamber at 85 degrees Celsius and 85% relative humidity for 1,000 hours.
The measurement taken by the scientists showed that the cracks were no longer visible and that the repaired module achieved restored insulation resistance, above the resistance requirement for safe operation. “After damp heat treatment, the module maintained a high insulation and again passed the wet leakage test,” they specified.
The researchers also decided to test the repair technique at an existing solar plant located in southern Germany. “The silicone was applied from a cartridge and then distributed and [smoothed] over the whole surface via a broad spatula,” they emphasized. “The repaired modules were left to operate in the field for about two months.”
A wet leakage test showed that the damaged panels were able to retain high insulation resistance and operate normally. “Early results also indicate that the module status is stabilized, but further long-term testing is needed,” they also stated. “It is unclear whether the repaired backsheet provides the same barrier to moisture as the original, undamaged backsheet.”
The sealant was presented in the paper Repair and preventive maintenance of photovoltaic modules with degrading backsheets using flowable silicone sealant, published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The research group comprised scientists from Belgian silicone product manufacturer Dow Silicones Belgium SRL, a unit of U.S.-based silicone adhesives and sealants provider Dow Corning; the Austrian Research Institute for Chemistry and Technology; and research center Silicon Austria Labs.

The scientists said the result is a world record for this kind of solar cell and that the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) certified the achievement of a 25.5% efficiency for the device.
The cell was built with an interlayer between a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) electron-transporting layer and a layer made of a halide perovskite layer by coupling chlorine-bonded SnO2 with a perovskite precursor containing chlorine. “This interlayer has atomically coherent features which enhance charge extraction and transport from the perovskite layer; and fewer interfacial defects,” the academics explained.
The defect-free connection layer is said to eliminate the risks related to passivation, which may not always provide the desired interface defect reduction, as the surface-treatment agents on the electron-transporting layer may dissolve while coating the perovskite thin film.
The cell was also able to retain around 90% of its initial efficiency after 500 hours under standard illumination. “Our findings provide guidelines for designing defect-minimizing interfaces between metal halide perovskites and electron-transporting layers,” said UNIST researcher Seok Sang-il.
The technique to develop the solar cell is presented in the study Perovskite solar cells with atomically coherent interlayers on SnO2 electrodes, which was recently published in nature.
In April, a group of researchers from UNIST and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) achieved a conversion efficiency of 25.6% in a single-junction perovskite solar cell. The result edges out the previous record of 25.2%, achieved in February by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and UNIST's earlier result of 25.17%, achieved in November 2020.

Australian solar start-up 5B has launched a new, more powerful version of its pre-assembled and relocatable modular Maverick solar solution as it seeks to accelerate the deployment of solar PV and smooth the way for manufacturing and deployment partners to join its “platform ecosystem”.
5B chief technology officer Simeon Baker-Finch said the new generation Maverick features a higher capacity 48-50 kW DC solar array and “plug-and-play” wiring designed for faster, easier and safer on-site deployment ideally suited for mining, commercial and industrial, and large-scale solar power generation.
“It’s 30% more powerful than the last generation. It’s plug and play pre-wired, easier to manufacture, and safer and faster to deploy,” he said.
“It is compatible with and optimized for the new 540-550 W module class which is fast becoming the preference for our customers in the utility scale solar industry.
“We’re now deploying 5B Mavericks all around the world so we needed to streamline the components, optimize the structure and accept that larger module class.”
Baker-Finch said the new generation Maverick is compatible with all Super League and Tier 1 silicon modules and each array comprises 90 pre-installed modules with preconfigured electricals for rapid connection of return cables to inverter onsite. Each of the nine A-frame beams comprises two rows of five in-portrait modules, connected via a hinge and anchored by a ballast. Each array weighs less than 6000 kilograms and when deployed measures six meters wide and 45 meters long.
The new Maverick features a new concrete-steel composite beam design which the company said enhances stability in high-wind environments, making it suitable for deployment to sites with 48 m/s wind speed. 5B said the system can be deployed on sites with wind speeds as high as 75 m/s with minor upgrades to configuration.
5B said the increased power capacity of the new Maverick delivers improved shipping density with four arrays able to fit compactly into a standard 40-foot shipping container while the design enables arrays to be positioned more closely onsite, improving land utilization.
Baker-Finch said the design changes would make it easier for manufacturing and deployment partners to become a member of the 5B “platform ecosystem”, helping accelerate the global deployment of solar.
“That is key,” he said. “We don’t need to just get faster in terms of how fast we can deploy a solar array, the reality is that we need to get faster in how quickly we can scale this industry.
“We needed to create a win-win solution where the end customer sees the benefit of the Maverick when it’s deployed on the ground but also that all of our partners, those being the folks that assemble the Mavericks in factories and those that deploy the Maverick on the ground, are able to do so in the most efficient way possible.
“The strategy is to design one and build many. That is what we’re trying to get at with this new generation.
“We have optimized a design that is easier to manufacture so it is much easier to scale up.”
Since the launch of 5B in 2017, the company has completed 52 solar PV projects worldwide totaling more than 32 MWp capacity.

5B’s Maverick arrays have proven popular with remote mining operations. Included in that portfolio is a 12 MW system which it delivered with Enerven for SA Water and a 4.3 MW project it delivered with independent power provider Nomadic Energy Australia for miner Northern Star Resources in Western Australia.
5B’s Maverick system is also the preferred technology for Sun Cable’s massive 17-20 GW solar farm being developed in the Northern Territory with the intent to export solar power to Singapore via a subsea transmission cable.
Baker-Finch said the new generation Maverick would allow the company to “shift the dial so we could get to the next level of volume”.
“We’ve booked more than 100 MW of sales of this new product across four countries (Australia, the United States, Latin America and India) already,” he said.
5B, which has its own manufacturing facility in Sydney, has already teamed with manufacturing partners in Adelaide and Vietnam.
The consortium behind the Sun Cable project is also looking to establish a solar module manufacturing facility in the Northern Territory to feed the $30 billion-plus project. Sun Cable earlier this year lodged a development application for the first phase of a manufacturing and assembly facility to be constructed in Darwin as it continues to progress plans for the world’s biggest solar+storage project.

SolarEdge Technologies announced its North American launch of two products: its Energy Bank battery and Energy Hub inverter.
SolarEdge said the DC-coupled residential energy storage battery provides 9.7 kWh of backup power. It can be connected in parallel with eight additional batteries, delivering up to 87 kWh of backup capacity. It has a round-trip efficiency of 94.5%, said the company. It said its DC-coupled technology requires one power conversion, rather than the three conversions that are needed with  AC-coupled technology.
The battery is able to be charged while simultaneously exporting power to the grid for utility bill credits.
The Energy Hub inverter ranges from 7.6kW to 11.4kW PV power and 10.3 kW backup power, with 200% DC oversizing to deliver higher energy yield for the home. The company said the backup power inverters simplify installations by reducing the need for main panel upgrades.
The devices can be connected wirelessly, and can link up with the SolarEdge Home EV charger. The equipment can be monitored and managed from the company’s mobile app. The software helps prioritize loads based on homeowner preferences, and applies algorithms that aid economical decisions, while accounting for external factors like weather events.

Research published by the Webber Energy Group at the University of Texas at Austin and nonprofit group The Ray has led to a partnership with geographic information system (GIS) mapping company Esri to create a highway right-of-way (ROW) solar evaluation tool.
The study found that installing solar panels at highway exits could generate up to 36 TWh per year. That is enough to power 12 million passenger electric vehicles, and has an estimated value of energy of $4 billion per year, said Esri.
Installing solar arrays at interchanges, exits, rest areas, visitor centers, which are maintained by state governments, can be challenging due to safety, environmental, and future land-use concerns. To address this, The Ray partnered with Esri to configure a solar mapping tool that analyzes how suitable and economically valuable a given ROW location might be.
The tool uses Esri’s ArcGIS software suite, and includes 3D modeling, solar radiation calculations based of elevation and surface, and viewshed analysis. The tool reduces what used to be a weeks- or months-long process into a fraction of the time, and does it more precisely.
The Ray has a solar test bed west of Georgia’s I-85, which the group said functions as a proving ground for solar, EV charging, and smart landscape architecture. The Ray now works in 15 states and over two dozen transportation agencies to replicate the results of the Georgia test bed.
(Read: “Solar in uncommon spaces”)
In addition to modeling the value of the solar array, the Esri model enables department of transportation developers to anticipate unintended consequences, such as the interruption of a scenic viewshed. It allows for preliminary site planning exercises, including altering shape, size, and scope of the project to evaluate different levels of impact to the surrounding community.
GIS continues to play a growing role in solar development. Some providers offer free, open-source resources , as well.
