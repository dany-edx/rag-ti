It combines lithium batteries and vanadium redox flow batteries at a facility owned by the group's AMG Graphite subsidiary in Hauzenberg, Germany.
The company said it will use the storage facility to flatten production-driven spikes in electricity demand, as a backup power supply and black-start source in case of full power failure.
“The battery was developed by AMG Engineering and AMG LIVA, and it is also suitable for solar energy storage,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The representative said that the battery will be integrated with a large-scale solar power plant in the future. The aim is to further lower the facility's energy costs and enable it to also provide grid services.
“All critical main parts are manufacturer of assembled in Germany,” the spokesperson said. “The vanadium redox flow battery is assembled in Hanau and the vanadium electrolyte in Nuremberg. The lithium-ion-modules for the Lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) battery come from strategic partners and the battery system is also assembled in Hanau.”
The company says the new battery ensures the optimal use of the technical and electrochemical properties of both storage technologies in a virtual battery configuration, and an optimal design for the energy storage assets. It reportedly takes advantage of lithium-ion battery tech's high power and energy density, fast response time, and high degree of standardization. It also benefits from the high cycle stability, fast charging-discharging, and flexible power-to-energy scaling of the vanadium redox flow battery concept. In addition, the battery offers automated monitoring and optimization based on self-learning algorithms.
“The economic implications of our approach is that the battery offers advantages in terms of both power and energy costs,” the spokesperson said, noting that the system has an expected lifecycle of more than 20,000 cycles.
AMG Group is currently developing three additional LIVA batteries. It says one at AMG Titanium Alloys’ plant in Nuremberg will focus on peak shaving, the integration of solar power, and the production of green hydrogen. Another, at AMG Chrome in Rotherham, England, will be used for solar power integration. A third one at AMG Engineering in Hanau will be used as a demonstration facility for a range of applications, the company said.

The so-called Pepperoni project will establish a pilot manufacturing line in Thalheim, Qcell’s headquarters in Germany. The name stems from the broader project titled ‘Pilot line for European Production of PEROvskite-Silicon taNdem modules on Industrial scale' or PEPPERONI.
The silicon-perovskite tandem cells will have a bottom silicon cell based on Qcell’s Q.ANTUM technology. “The project aims to scale up the active area of perovskite/Si tandems from the 1cm2 of today’s record devices to industry-relevant dimensions,” the group said in a statement.
The project will identify and address barriers to speeding up the technology’s mass manufacturing and market penetration. One of the project’s goals is to minimize scaling losses by using innovative materials and equipment. It will also develop thin-film deposition processers and equipment, with the ultimate goal of building a new production capacity in Europe.
“At HZB we have developed the tandem technology to world-record efficiency level on lab scale,” said Bernd Stannowski, head of group industry compatible processes at HZB. “We are now looking forward to cooperate in the Pepperoni consortium with partners from science and industry to jointly scale this new and very promising technology up and transfer it to industry.”
The four-year project is partly funded by Horizon Europe, to a total of €14.5 million ($14.9 million). It includes 17 partners from 12 countries across Europe, with a key objective to demonstrate 26%-efficient modules or higher on industrial scale

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/23/sweden-set-to-install-750-mw-of-new-solar-in-2022/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,SWEDEN",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"NOVEMBER 23, 2022",Sweden set to install 750 MW of new solar in 2022,"Sweden could potentially add 750 MW of solar in 2022, according to data from research firm Becquerel Sweden. In 2021, the country added 499.7 MW of solar, up by about 25% year on year from 2020.
The International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme‘s (IEA-PVPS)’s Task 1 recently published a report on PV applications in Sweden in 2021. While PV systems for self-consumption dominate Sweden’s solar market, unsubsidized utility-scale solar parks are starting to proliferate. Becquerel estimates between 110 MW to 150 MW of capacity will be added by the end of this year.
“When collecting the data we conducted interviews, and the general word from the developers is that larger projects were postponed until 2022, mainly due to supply chain constraints,” said Amelia Westerberg, a PV market analyst at Becquerel Sweden and the co-author of the report.
This growth has occurred despite the removal of solar from the Swedish-Norwegian renewable electricity certificate system on Dec. 31, 2021. The system works by trading electricity certificates, both Swedish and Norwegian, on the Nord Pool exchange for a price agreed between purchasers and sellers. The two countries release these certificates to renewable energy producers for every megawatt-hour they generate for the first 15 years of a plant’s lifetime.
However, solar had minimal market share, so the removal of the subsidy did not seem to have a significant impact on the large-scale segment. Some unsubsidized projects are already under development in the country and their current growth in popularity is more likely connected to generally favorable conditions for solar.
Corporate power purchase agreements and PV cooperative models are expected to dominate the large-scale solar market, according to IEA-PVPS.
“This market segment is now entirely reliant on uptakers buying PV-generated electricity above spot market price, which they are often glad to do,” said Westerberg.
Despite the recent growth, extensive permitting processes are still a barrier to rapid growth in the segment, according to Westerberg.
“Whether this is a short-term problem caused by inexperience of such processes in the deciding institutions or whether it is a long-term problem for the industry remains to be seen,” the IEA-PVPS team concluded.

It will select developers to build the projects in Manje, the province of Tete, and Chimbunila, Niassa province. Bidders can apply to develop either or both projects. Interested developers have until Jan. 17, 2023 to submit their bids, with prequalification requirements provided on request to interested parties.
ARENE launched the tender as part of a wider renewables procurement program called Promotion of Renewable Energy Auction Programme (PROLER). It received funding from the European Union through the French Development Agency. In total, PROLER will procure 120 MW of solar and wind.
Mozambique has not installed much solar so far, with installations standing at just 55MW by the end of 2021, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). However, a number of sizable projects are currently in development. The country is planning its first floating solar project.

“Microwave is competitive price-wise due to the production on a large industrial scale of magnetrons and electronic controls,” the scientists said, noting that the technology can provide heat uniformly, so it does not harm the glass or the rest of the components in solar panels.
The system initially uses electromagnetic waves to heat the panels. It then conveys the generated heat from the silicon to the ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) layers for delamination.
In their first tests, the academics used the process by applying an internal temperature to process the separation process ranging from 45 C to 55 C and a power of 100 W for two minutes. They achieved a separation force with a different area of glass and saw it increase depending on larger areas.
“After heating the PV panel with a microwave, the results showed that removing the glass panel could be conveniently conducted easier than a non-heated panel by about 50% to 60% of the force,” they said. “The adhesive strength of EVA was lowered after a microwave heating process after demonstrating that the approach allowed for easy separation of broken glass from the PV panel.”
Higher process temperatures could improve the overall recycling process and the removal of those components from the PV laminate, while retaining the integrity of the solar module. It might also enable the removal of all glass parts from the sample surface.
The next print edition of pv magazine – due out on December 6 – will visit Ukraine to examine the extent of damage caused to the nation’s energy infrastructure, including its solar plants, and we will include coverage of how PV has been affected in the newly-liberated region of Kherson.
The scientists presented the new technology in “Glass separation process for recycling of solar photovoltaic panels by microwave heating,” which was recently published in AIP Conference Proceedings. The research team includes scientists from Kasetsart University, Mahidol University, and Chiang Mai University.
“In summary, the microwave frequency appeared to be an attractive option for delaminating expired or damaged PV panels,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/23/building-renewables-emits-carbon-but-building-them-faster-emits-far-less/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 23, 2022","Building renewables emits carbon, but building them faster emits far less","From pv magazine USA
The construction of clean energy components produces carbon emissions. New research by Columbia University Climate School’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory looks at just how much carbon the world could emit as it mines, manufactures, transports, constructs, and maintains solar and wind resources.
The report shows that emissions related to the energy transition are non-negligible, but there is a positive feedback loop in which the faster we build, the less emissions we produce. Having non-emitting power on hand to build more renewable energy resources will only lower the embodied emissions and stem the tide of climate change more rapidly. The researchers published their findings in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The amount of emissions tied to an electricity generating facility from raw materials to operations is often referred to as “carbon backpack.” The current pace of renewables buildout is currently predicted to lead to about a 2.7 C temperature increase by 2100, resulting in 185 billion tons of carbon backpack. This is equivalent to about five or six years of global emissions at current rates. 
The backpack is lighter with a more aggressive path. If humanity is to build infrastructure quickly enough to limit global warming to 2 C, which international agreements aiming to come under the 2 C mark, the carbon backpack would be cut nearly in half to 95 billion tons by 2100. If the energy transition exceeds all expectations and we limit temperature rise to 1.5 C, the carbon backpack would be more of a handbag – amounting to 20 billion tons by 2100, or about six months of current global emissions.
“The message is that it is going to take energy to rebuild the global energy system, and we need to account for that,” said researcher Corey Lesk. “Any way you do it, it’s not negligible. But the more you can initially bring on renewables, the more you can power the transition with renewables.”
Lesk and his colleagues said that these are likely conservative estimates. The study includes generation-side emissions, and omits the cost of deploying energy storage and transmission. Distributed energy resources require much less of this type of infrastructure than centralized power, so the profile of solar and wind projects will impact this outcome greatly.
The study also modeled carbon emissions from adapting to sea-level rise. It found that construction of sea walls and moving cities inland where necessary would generate 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2,100 under the 2 C scenario. More energy will need to be expended to control inland flooding, irrigation in areas that might become drier, and adapting buildings to higher temperature extremes.
Lesk remains optimistic. He said that given cost decreases in recent years for renewable technologies, 80% to 90% of what the world needs could be installed in the next few decades, especially if current subsidies for fossil-fuel production are diverted to renewables.
This global clean energy transition is estimated to cost $3.5 trillion per year every year through 2050 in order to reach net-zero emissions, according to one study, or up to about $14 trillion for the United States alone in the same timeframe, according to another report.
“Despite these limitations, we conclude that the magnitude of CO2 emissions embedded in the broader climate transition are of geophysical and policy relevance,” said the researchers. “Transition emissions can be greatly reduced under faster-paced decarbonization, lending new urgency to policy progress on rapid renewable energy deployment.”

The team recently installed a 4.3 kW PV system on top of a storage container at Oliktok Point, Alaska. The system uses bifacial solar modules from an undisclosed manufacturer.
“Data collected at Oliktok Point will track daily energy gains and help develop predictive models of energy performance based on the tilt angle and orientation of the solar modules,” said the research institute.
Temperatures at the remote location can go as low as -43 C, with a wind chill factor of -57 C. Structures are covered by ice for most of the year and are exposed to harsh shoreline conditions.
“Oliktok Point is a very environmentally relevant field site – it checks all the boxes,” said Andrew Glen, the manager of atmospheric sciences at Sandia National Laboratories. “We go from permanent ice through the winter, with permafrost, to the sea ice breaking up, to open water and a melt season where the ground softens and turns to mud.”
The results from the system will show which system designs and technologies are most efficient in northern environments with limited sun in the winter.
“Alaska, and Oliktok in particular, represents an edge case for PV deployment,” said Bruce King, the director of Sandia’s Photovoltaic Systems Evaluation Lab. “Learning about edge cases helps inform conventional system design and may identify opportunities to increase energy harvest that might not otherwise be considered. This can be particularly important for PV deployments in other geographic areas that are also not optimal.”
The team said that it hopes the Oliktok Point project will help to facilitate the rollout of climate-optimized PV systems for remote off-grid communities in Alaska.
