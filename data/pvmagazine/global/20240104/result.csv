Cleantech Solar, a supplier of renewable energy to corporate entities, has secured a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with US module manufacturer First Solar. It has agreed to construct 150 MW of solar and 16.8 MW of wind-generating assets in India, supplying around 7.3 GWh of clean electricity to First Solar’s new 3.3 GW vertically integrated solar manufacturing facility in the state of Tamil Nadu.
Once it is fully commissioned by the third quarter of 2024, the solar and wind generation assets are expected to cover up to 70% of the facility’s anticipated electricity needs. They are expected to displace almost 7,000 kilotons of CO2 emissions over the duration of the PPA.
Cleantech Solar will procure 150 MW of advanced, India-made Series 7 thin-film solar panels from First Solar, for use in the PV component of the project. The modules are expected to be delivered in the first half of 2024.
First Solar’s cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film modules have among the lowest carbon and water footprint of any commercially available PV modules. The modules are included in the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) registry for sustainable electronics, signifying strong performance on metrics evaluating the management of substances in the product, manufacturing energy and water use, product packaging, end-of-life recycling and corporate responsibility.
“Our new manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu sets a high benchmark for responsible and sustainable vertically integrated solar manufacturing, not just in India, but globally,” said Sujoy Ghosh, vice president and manging director of First Solar India. “By powering our operations with clean, renewably-generated electricity, we are working to further reduce our environmental footprint, which is already the lowest in the industry.”
First Solar’s Tamil Nadu plant, located in an area of high baseline water stress, is purportedly the world’s first net-zero water withdrawal solar manufacturing facility.
“This collaboration extends beyond powering First Solar’s flagship manufacturing facility in India; it involves leveraging their advanced, ultra-low carbon thin film solar panels to energize our solar assets,” said Sachin Jain, chief executive officer of Cleantech Solar.
With this latest agreement, Cleantech Solar’s total portfolio in Tamil Nadu now stands at nearly 500 MW (including solar, wind and hybrid power projects under operational and construction stages).
Singapore-based Cleantech Solar has built numerous solar and wind projects across India and Southeast Asia, with around 1.2 GWp of assets in various stages of development. The company is backed by Keppel Corp., Keppel Asia Infrastructure Fund, and Shell Singapore.

The figures, based on statistics from regional grid operators in Slovakia, represents a significant year-on-year increase in PV capacity. In 2022, Slovakia deployed 60 MW, while in 2021 it added 5 MW.
SAPI Director Ján Karaba told pv magazine the main market drivers in 2023 were a legislative framework supporting prosumer PV installations, a grant scheme for small residential PV systems, and a grant scheme for commercial and municipal PV installations that expired at the end of the year.
“By far the most capacity was installed in residential and C&I segments,” Karaba said.
This was likely supported by a new phase of the Slovak Innovation and Energy Agency’s residential PV rebate scheme, which launched in July and offered a total budget of €140 million ($153.3 million) for 2023, covering up to 50% of purchase and installation costs.
The good performance of the rooftop segment, however, was not matched by the utility-scale PV segment.
“Only a handful of large scale installations were connected to the grid last year,” Karaba explained.
The utility-scale solar segment needs the national regulator to overhaul the way grid-connection costs are charged to producers, because now they are one of the highest in the European Union, he added.
SAPI estimates that Slovakia’s solar market will grow by around 300 MW in 2024 and by roughly the same amount in 2025.
In November, Slovakia’s Ministry of Economy published a call for bids in the capex auction scheme under its recovery and resilience plan, which will close later this month. The auction call will not allocate any capacity, but will accept bids of up to 5 MW of installed power. Meanwhile, a capex financial support scheme for enterprises will start this year, and Karaba said it will “likely boost the C&I segment.”
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Slovakia had around 537 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2022. If SAPI's figures are confirmed, the country surpassed 737 MW at the end of December 2023.

PowerChina Chile, Renewable Energy – a unit of energy and infrastructure developer PowerChina – has finished building a 480 MW solar plant in María Elena, in Chile's Antofagasta region.
Claudio Araya Aguilar, the company's head of human resources and labor relations, announced the plans on LinkedIn. He said that the facility he manages is now Chile's largest operational solar farm.
The company built the plant with 882,720 panels provided by an undisclosed manufacturer, on a plot of land spanning 435 hectares.
Araya Aguilar said that the company is using an unspecified robotic panel cleaning technology to reduce water consumption by 80% at the facility.
The project is connected to a 9.6 km transmission line that will connect to the National Electric System at the Miraje Substation.
Construction work began in June 2022 under the Generadora Metropolitana joint venture between Chilean power company AME and France's EDF. They said at the end of 2021 that they had obtained $980 million of financing, part of which would be invested in the construction of the solar plant.
Before this project, the largest solar plant in Chile was the Guanchoi facility, at 398 MW. It was developed by Enel Green Power Chile and began commercial operations in July 2023.

Square LFP battery cells suffered the biggest blow with a 10.1% price reduction in December, followed by Pouch NCM523 with 7% and Square NCM523 with 6.7%.
“A combination of lower-than-expected market demand and rapid capacity expansion led to oversupply and significant inventory build-up, evident since the third quarter of 2023,” TrendForce said in a press release. “Intense competition in the bidding process pushed centralized procurement prices (bulk orders negotiated on price) below CNY 0.40 ($0.06)/Wh, undercutting the production costs of some manufacturers.”
TrendForce said fewer market orders and suppliers’ need to stabilize cash flows led to the low-price strategies, with consumer demand also cooling in the final month of the year.
But as the electric vehicle market is projected to grow by up to 20% in 2024, and supply chain inventory also expected to normalize, lithium battery product stock levels and prices should return to normal in the second half of 2024, according to the company.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/04/idaho-commission-cuts-rooftop-pv-compensation-driving-industry-concerns/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 4, 2024","Idaho commission cuts rooftop PV compensation, driving industry concerns","From pv magazine USA
Slipping the resolution through in the final days of the year, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (PUC) passed a resolution to cut net energy metering for rooftop solar. The new rule-making decision also approved electric rate increases that are expected to disproportionately impact low-income customers.
Net energy metering (NEM) involves the electric utility providing credit to rooftop solar customers for delivering electricity to the grid. It is an essential factor in the return on investment for rooftop solar and helps encourage local sharing of clean energy.
Utility Idaho Power will no longer be required to pay retail rates for net-metered electricity, instead shifting to a net billing format. The Sierra Club estimates that the new average annual net billing rate will be under $0.06/kWh.
Over the past decade-plus, the United States has launched its residential solar industry, bringing predictable and often low-cost, local, and clean energy to homeowner’s rooftops. Rooftop solar is a source of financial stability for customers, and for its tens of thousands of employees, it has created decent paying jobs.
Idaho now follows California in slashing NEM. The move caused California, which was once among the most robust rooftop solar industries in the world, to suffer an 80% drop in installations in the immediate aftermath of the cuts. A major insurer of California rooftop solar businesses told pv magazine USA that 75% of California rooftop solar companies are now at high risk for bankruptcy, and as many as 17,000 jobs have already been lost. California’s struggles serve as a warning to the rest of the nation, but Idaho has not heeded that warning.
“The commissioners are saying the voices and expertise of thousands of Idahoans and small businesses are not as important as the voice of the state’s largest monopoly utility,” said Alex McKinley, Owner of Empowered Solar.
During recent Idaho PUC public hearings, not one public testimony came in favor of the resolution. Despite this unified opposition from the public, the utilities commission ruled in favor of Idaho Power’s plan.
Idaho Power justified the unpopular decision based on an internally produced report called “Value of Distributed Resources Study.” Sierra Club and other environmental groups hired an independent analyst, who concluded that the Idaho Power report severely undervalued rooftop solar’s contribution to the grid. The report was based on selective, internal utility data, said the analyst.
“The proposal willfully misleads the public on the value of rooftop solar to Idaho Power, ignores the huge environmental advantages of distributed clean energy and is likely to kill Idaho’s solar industry and the good paying jobs it brings to our state,” said Mike Engle, chair at Portneuf Resource Council.
From a business perspective, the motivation for utilities to suppress the value of customer-owned rooftop solar is clear. Idaho Power would much prefer to sell as much electricity as it can to customers in its territory, rather than sustain a market that enables homeowners to achieve a degree of energy independence and pricing clarity for the long run.
To add insult to injury, the PUC also approved a rate increase for all Idaho Power customers, assessing a monthly fixed fee called a “service charge.” Customers will be charged $10 per month in 2024, and $15 per month in 2025, regardless of power usage. The move is expected to be particularly damaging to low-income customers who monitor their energy use to avoid high bills.
“Fixed rates are regressive. They disproportionately raise rates on your poorest customers while barely increasing rates for the wealthiest,” said Lisa Young, director of Idaho Sierra Club.
Who’s next?
More utility attempts to quash rooftop solar are inevitable as other states see the “success” of California utilities in crushing the industry. The results may illuminate which utility commissions across the nation are truly operating in the interest of the public they serve.
In Oregon, Idaho Power is attempting to pass the same solar rate changes it implemented for its Idaho customer base. Oregon rejected the plan, though Idaho Power is expected to continue pushing the change.
In West Virginia, utilities Mon Power and Potomac Edison are attempting to cut rooftop solar export rates by more than half. The state’s public utility commission suggested a less severe cut, but installers in the state are warning that popular low-income solar programs will not be able to operate under the proposed rate structure.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/04/color-characterization-technique-for-bipv/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,SWITZERLAND,WESTERN EUROPE",LIOR KAHANA,"JANUARY 4, 2024",Color characterization technique for BIPV,"Researchers from Switzerland have developed a novel color characterization technique for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).
The method, dubbed large area illumination (LAI) colorimeter, uses a fiber optic spectrometer and large area illumination. With that, it can overcome the issues of existing color characterization techniques, which struggle to accurately determine color when it is behind a transparent layer, such as a solar PV laminate.
“We are currently working on enhancing the method by testing light sources and designing a portable device to characterize the color of BIPV modules,” corresponding author Alejandro Borja Block told pv magazine. “We are studying light sources, and calibration procedures, and proposing a suitable portable tool.”
The novel LAI method uses an optical fiber spectrometer to detect color characterization signals. It was positioned at a 45-degree angle relative to the samples and 7 mm above their rear side. As the measurements depend on the lightning, the illuminated area must be greater than the measuring spot. To achieve that, the researchers used a diffuse lamp with a visible spectrum signal similar to D65, which roughly corresponds to the average midday light in Western and Northern Europe.
To prove the utility of the new method, the scientists measured the differences in color measurement between color foils without glass and with glass thicknesses of 3.2 mm and 6.4 mm. They did this over eight different foil types, ranging from high-reflective white to low-reflective clay. Then, they compared the differences detected by the novel method to those detected by existing color characterization techniques – a scanner, a portable colorimeter, and an integrated sphere spectrometer.

“These devices produce accurate reflectance measurements when the samples under investigation are positioned in the aperture of the integrating sphere or the colorimeter,” they emphasized. “In the case of integrated PV modules, the front layer is based on several-millimeter-thick glass, which creates measurement artifacts. The above-mentioned devices send a light probe through their aperture to process the signal. A reduction in reflectance is observed due to the thickness of the transparent layer.”
According to their findings, when using the LAI method, the signal is only slightly decreased when changing the sample from free foil to glassed foil. Compared to that, and with the same samples, a high reflectance reduction is found with the integrated sphere spectrometer and the portable colorimeter. For example, while the commercial portable colorimeter had measured the color change at 57, the results of the LAI were only 3.
In addition, the scientists also found that standard scanner machines cannot accurately assess colors in PV modules because the light is trapped in the glass. “The measurements comparing the characterization techniques indicate that the LAI colorimeter performs much better than the commercially available solutions in terms of accuracy,” the research group highlighted.
Its findings were presented in “Accurate color characterization of solar photovoltaic modules for building integration,” published on Solar Energy. The scientists come from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/04/renewables-powered-high-temperature-heat-pumps-are-cheapest-option-for-industrial-steam/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HEAT PUMPS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRIA,EUROPE,SPAIN,WESTERN EUROPE",LIOR KAHANA,"JANUARY 4, 2024",Renewables-powered high temperature heat pumps are cheapest option for industrial steam,"A research team at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in Austria has suggested that policymakers subsidize industrial projects using heat pumps to generate steam with a tariff of €3 ($3.2) per gigajoule (GJ). That is the result of a pricing analysis of the environmental impact of different steam techniques, which found heat pumps working with renewable energy to be the least costly. “Taking into account the 43.20 Terajoules (TJ) produced over the lifetime of the plant, a subsidy of €129,600 could be paid,” the researchers stated.
Although the research has focused on wind energy as the renewable source of electricity, co-author Lukas Zeilerbauer told pv magazine that using solar energy should yield very similar results. “PV generally has a higher impact on global warming potential than wind power, but of course still much lower than fossil energy carriers,” he said. “The PV exhibits a shadow price of €1.46 ($1.58), so it is nearly the same as wind.”
In the paper “Life cycle assessment and shadow cost of steam produced by an industrial-sized high-temperature heat pump,” published in Sustainable Production and Consumption, the scientists explained that they utilized Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) to compare different steam-generating techniques used on an industrial scale, including high-temperature heat pumps (HTHPs). Other steam-making techniques include steam-biogas processes, solid biomass processes, and other processes based on natural gas and light fuel oil.
The researchers considered two different scenarios, one in which steam is produced with 2-bar pressure and one with 5-bar pressure. For both scenarios, they took into account use of wind or grid electricity.
“The issue with LCA methods is that they usually consist of more than ten damage categories and hence different results dealing with different areas, and it is difficult to find weighting factors between these very different results,” the research group explained. “However, experts have proposed using monetary values early on. One of those approaches is shadow price, which has the underlying idea that in the end a government, representing its people, has to ‘repair’ environmental damage and is therefore interested in mitigating these costs.”
Not surprisingly, the academics found the combination of heat pumps with wind power has the lowest cost of €1.44 per GJ in the 2-bar scenario, and €2.24 in the 5-bar case. Changing wind energy to the Spanish grid mix has resulted in LCA prices of €3.83 and €6.23 respectively. In comparison, the use of solid biomass for the steam process had an environmental price of €17.2 per GJ, and light fuel oil cost €9.81.

Looking more in-depth into the environmental effects of the different methods, the research has found the best-case scenario to reduce 98% of greenhouse emissions. However, other environmental measures showed more mixed results, as, for example, toxicity-related results fluctuated between the heat pumps and the benchmarks.
“An unexpected finding was that the working fluid and its leakage did not have a significant contribution to the global warming potential but was almost solely responsible for the ozone depletion potential,” the researchers highlighted. They assumed the use of R134a as the working fluid, as it is the only one with available information in the LCA academic literature.
The HTHP examined in this study was designed for implementation in the pickling line of a steel plant in Spain. It has a nominal heat supply capacity of 250 kW and includes a custom-designed flash tank for steam generation, as well as a circulation pump.
“Although the steam-generating heat pump considered in this study was designed to be implemented in the finishing line of a steel plant, the results of this study can be applied to many other industrial sectors, as steam is a universal heat carrier for many industrial processes,” the academics explained. “This heat pump could be used in any other process that requires low-pressure steam of up to 5 bar.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/04/hemetsberger-wages-battle-for-gender-parity-at-solarpower-europe/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",ANGELA SKUJINS,"JANUARY 4, 2024",Hemetsberger wages battle for gender parity at SolarPower Europe,"This month Walburga Hemetsberger celebrates five years as the CEO of SolarPower Europe – the European Union’s largest association advocating for the solar panel industry from the seat of European policy, Brussels.
Speaking to pv magazine, the former competition and finance lawyer – who made a stunning switch to a career in the energy industry in 2009 – said she has a lot to be proud of over half a decade steering SolarPower Europe’s ship. From the outside looking in, one could assume the high points were navigating the solar surge and numerous European Union policy shifts to meet demand.
But a surprising milestone for Hemetsberger is achieving almost equal male-to-female representation on the board of her 39-year-old workplace.
“When I came in, I was working with a board which was male-only,” Hemetsberger said. “By now we've already almost reached equal representation of men and females.”
Six female board members are sitting on the 15-member strong leadership team, recommended and appointed by the respective companies. Additionally, 28 of SolarPower Europe’s 50-member workforce identifies as female. This means that almost half of SolarPower Europe is staffed by non-males.
Hemetsberger said she knew she needed more women on the board on her first day of work.
“We were just encouraging companies who wanted to have a board seat to put forward women,” she said. “At some point, we discussed whether we should put forward quotas, but then the development was just very positive so there was no need.”
According to the sector’s leading research agency the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), this parity is almost par with recently published data that found 40% of the 4.9 million-strong workforce in 2022 was female. This is twice as much as oil, wind and gas.
Despite the optimism, women’s employment in solar was reportedly “uneven” – non-males were mostly hired to fill administrative positions (58%) followed by science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) jobs (32%) and managerial roles (30%). An even smaller amount (17%) held senior management positions.
The Paris-based International Energy Agency said the historically male-dominated energy sector is impacting pay packets, and in 2018 women in the energy sector earned an estimated 15% less than their male counterparts – a pay gap wider than other industries.
In contrast, the three-year-old Brussels-based association representing the local solar manufacturing sector, the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC), has no women on its 14-member strong board and only one female staff member out of four employees. pv magazine sent questions to ESMC about the lack of female employment and board member representation. Secretary General Johan Lindahl said the two associations could not be compared in size and age but conceded that the ESMC's all-male board represents the “unfortunate reality” of the solar sector's gender imbalance.
“There are far too few female founders and C-level executives among the approximately 200 companies in the European PV manufacturing industry,” he said. “The same goes for the downstream sector, but I don't have current numbers on this. But yes, the scarcity of female leaders in European PV manufacturing is reflected in the current composition of the ESMC board, which regrettably consists entirely of male members.”
Although Lindahl said the topic of gender diversity is relevant, “I think it's wise to start looking at the industry first.”
In Nov. 2022 the European Commission adopted new rules on corporate board gender balance aiming to help “break the glass ceiling.” This includes targets, such as 40% of non-executive director positions and 33% of all director positions held by the underrepresented sex. However, the directive falls short of calling for quotas – something Hemetsberger personally advocates for but has not pursued on a SolerPower Europe level; she said it is not her association's job to mandate rules but to recommend best practice. But in saying that, Hemetsberger does believe a policy framework could be established to attract and retain women in higher-paying, senior positions.
“We're trying to encourage companies in the sector to look at the great benefits that more diversity has, and encourage them to look at the best practices that we've been bringing to the forefront,” she said.
Getting women excited and employed in solar should start well before they want to climb the professional ladder, Hemetsberger said, adding “it needs to start in the kindergarten to get girls excited about more technical jobs.”
Data published by the organization STEM Women shows women graduating from these higher education programs in the UK grew to 26% in 2019. But few role models, exclusive workplaces and harmful stereotypes about women’s intelligence could be driving those who graduate out of the industry, according to the American Association of University Women (AAUW).
There are also unspoken deterrents specific to women working in solar, such as the predominance of men, according to Solar Energy International. But there are efforts to combat this. The Colorado-based training organization runs a specialized program encouraging female participation and claims to have connected more than 450 women and non-binary individuals to solar energy training, networking and mentorship opportunities.
Then there is the Women in Solar Europe (WiSEU) advocacy group, spearheaded by Carmen Madrid, the founding director of London-based renewable energy consultancy firm Circular Synergies. The organization aims to address external and internal barriers preventing women from progressing in their PV careers and gaining leadership positions. WiSEU does this through in-person networking, mentorship matchmaking, masterclasses and other initiatives.
Asked whether Hemetsberger has personally experienced any sexism during her time in the PV industry, she said there have been no “aggressive barriers”. But sometimes during discussions she has to stand her ground, “maybe a little more than the men have to do,” she said. Compared to her previous workplaces, however, she describes solar as “cool”.
At the top of SolarPower Europe, Hemetsberger has ridden the ups and downs of the solar wave for five years. The technology itself has changed, as well as access, manufacturing and policy. She has played a hand in balancing the gender scales within her association and believes that the whole team “can be proud” of the achievement. But Hemetsberger is aware other businesses, organizations and institutions need to ramp up their efforts to attract and retain women in the solar renewable race because according to her, “it’s not good enough yet.”

“Through the combination of synergistic additive-modified wide-bandgap perovskite and a meticulously designed device structure with optical and electrical considerations, we successfully fabricated a 1 cm2 tandem perovskite/perovskite/silicon triple-junction solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 26.4%,” the research's lead author, Stefaan de Wolf, told pv magazine.
“This achievement not only represents the highest reported efficiency in the field but also crucially validates the viability of the triple-junction solar cell concept, laying a robust foundation for future research in this domain,” co-author, Fuzong Xu, added.
The scientists sought to address the challenge of wide-bandgap perovskites by using synergistic additives such as potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) and methylammonium iodide (MAI). This modifies organic-inorganic perovskites, while resulting in defect passivation, grain enlargement, and mitigating thiocyanate-induced phase segregation.
For the top perovskite cells used in the triple-junction device, the researchers utilized a perovskite material known as Cs0.1FA0.9PbBr2.1I0.9, which they modified with KSCN and MAI. For the mid cell, they used the FAPbI3-based perovskite.
The triple junction cell was fabricated with a 15.0%-efficient top perovskite cell with an energy bandgap of 1.98 eV, a 22.9%-efficient mid perovskite cell with an energy bandgap of 1.52 eV, and a bottom silicon cell with an efficiency of 19.5% and an energy bandgap of 1.12 eV.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the triple junction device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 26.4%, an open-circuit voltage of 3.04 V, a short-circuit current density of 11.9mA/cm2 and a fill factor of 72.9%. The team claims this remarkable performance is mainly due to the high efficiency of the perovskite bottom cell, which is one of the highest ever reported for a cell with such a high bandgap.
“The choice of the synergistic additives was strategic, mitigating the negative impact, accelerating photo-induced phase segregation, of the confined thiocyanate ions by utilizing their reaction with the MA+ to evaporate out of films in the form of MA and HSCN gas under 100 C,” explained Xu.
“Regarding the device structure, it is noteworthy that the ultra-thin gold interconnection layer, commonly used in perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cells, proved unsuitable for triple-junction devices due to significant absorption in the middle junction’s light response region, thereby limiting the overall efficiency,” added de Wolf.
The solar cell was described in the study “Monolithic perovskite/perovskite/silicon triple-junction solar cells with cation double displacement enabled 2.0 eV perovskites,” published in Joule.
“Perovskite/perovskite/Si 3-J solar cells with modified top cells display a remarkable power conversion efficiency improvement compared with the previous state-of-the-art ones, paving the way toward monolithic perovskite-based 3-J tandem solar cells with an efficiency greater than its 2-J counterparts,” the scientists concluded.
