Concretely, during his visit, the two countries launched the so-called “Supreme Strategic Cooperation Council (SCSC)”– a new institution aiming to forge stronger business ties between Greece and Saudi Arabia in various economic areas, including green energies and hydrogen.
And there is no doubt that the most significant agreement signed concerns the East to Med data Corridor (ECM) project, which is a subsea and land data cable system that will connect Europe with Asia through Greece and Saudi Arabia.
The agreement for the eye fabric optic data cable was signed by MENA Hub, owned by Saudi Arabia’s STC, the Greek Public Power Company (PPC), the Greek telecoms and satellite applications company TTSA, and the Cyprus Telecommunications Authority (CYTA). The project has an estimated cost of €800 million and construction is slated to begin by the end of the year, with completion scheduled for 2025.
In line with the launch of the SCSC, bin Salman told Greece’s prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis that “we have also historical opportunities … we’re going to finalize a lot of it today, linking the grid of electricity which we can provide Greece and Southwest Europe through Greece with much cheaper renewable energy. And we are going to sign a MoU about that today.”
He continued, “Also we are working about hydrogen and how to turn Greece as a hub for Europe to hydrogen. That’s a game changer for both of us. Also we are working in linking the telecommunication grid. All of these three items, it’s big items that are going to change the position of Greece and Saudi Arabia and are going to support Europe, especially South and West Europe, with much cheaper energy and more efficient energy coming from renewable energy.”
In addition to the above mentioned agreements, the two states also signed several memorandums of understanding (MOUs). Specifically, Greece’s foreign ministry said 16 private agreements had been inked between a total of 100 Greek and about 40 Saudi Arabian enterprises concerning a wide spectrum of business activities, including in the energy, waste management, maritime, and air transport sectors.
Perhaps the most significant MOU in the energy field was the one signed between Greece’s Mytilineos Group and Saudi Arabia’s Ajlan and Bros Holding Group which aims develop energy and hydrogen projects in both countries. However, no further details were provided and  it should be noted that both groups also invest heavily outside of green power.
The Saudi crown prince told the Greek prime minister, “I promise you that when I come to Greece, I will not come empty-handed. We have a lot of stuff that’s going to be game changer for both countries and also for the whole region.”
However, although he appeared to bear gifts, the value of them is highly contested. Indeed, comments were made alluding to the fact he should try to push renewable energy development in his homeland before embarking on an intercontinental mission.
Saudi Arabia is a laggard in renewable energy development and until a decade ago it was actively blocking the world’s green energy transition. Following the global energy paradigm shift, and more specifically the shift of its neighbors (most notable the United Arab Emirates), towards renewables, Saudi Arabia tried to embrace low carbon energies. In 2016, for example, it launched the so-called Vision 2030, aiming to achieve zero emissions by 2060 and generate 50% of its electricity by renewable energies by 2030.
However, the Vision 2030 remains largely dormant and according to data published by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the Kingdom fueled nearly all of its electricity generation in 2020 with natural gas (61%) and crude oil (39%). A number of big announcements for new energy master plans and renewable tenders have never materialized and the country has only built a handful projects.
By comparison, Greece has made concrete progress towards its green energy transition over the past few years. In addition to setting ambitious goals, it has also updated its energy laws to make for a faster licensing scheme, it runs regular renewable power tenders, and if it doesn’t get derailed by the current energy crisis and the war in Ukraine, it has a lot of chances to transition to a green energy system. Therefore, Saudi Arabia can learn from Greece.
Bin Salman’s visit to Greece on July 26 and 27 is followed by an official visit to Paris, France.

“Combining the NAS battery with the PV system will enable electricity to be supplied to important equipment at the plant for up to 10 hours when power from the grid is interrupted,” the company said in a statement. “Moreover, it will be used as a countermeasure against instantaneous voltage drops caused by lightning strikes and so forth. This will contribute to the stable supply of products by averting problems with equipment, production line shutdowns, and so forth due to instantaneous voltage drops.”

NGK Insulators said it will evaluate the battery's ability to prevent production losses at the factory. Both the battery and the PV system are due to begin commercial operations in 2024.
NAS batteries use sodium for the negative electrode and sulfur for the positive electrode. According to the manufacturer, the devices make a 24/7 power supply feasible with solar power for six to 10 hours and a NAS battery for 14 to 18 hours at one-third of the rated output. The systems can be cascaded to sizes over 100 MW.
The Japanese company recently acquired an unspecified stake in EneCoat Technologies, a Kyoto University PV technology spinoff. Enecoat develops perovskite solar cells through a wet process based on organic chemistry, a low-temperature coating process and roll-to-roll printing.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/28/us-to-extend-investment-tax-credit-for-solar-at-30-to-2032/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 28, 2022",US to extend Investment Tax Credit for solar at 30% to 2032,"From pv magazine USA
In a surprise victory for the solar and clean technology industries, US Senator Joe Manchin and Democrats reached an agreement on a reconciliation bill, dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The bill includes $370 billion in spending for renewable energy and climate measures.
One of the most impactful provisions in the bill, which can be read in full text here, is the long-term extension of the Investment Tax Credit, which has been instrumental in launching the solar industry we know today. The bill calls for a 10-year extension at 30% of the cost of the installed equipment, which will then step down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. The tax credit applies to individuals adopters of solar technology.
The 30% credit also applies to energy storage whether it is co-located or installed as standalone energy storage. This enables the retrofit of a battery to a solar array while taking advantage of the credit.
One measure that was hoped for, but is not in the bill, was the “refundability” clause. Refundability means that if the tax credit value exceeds taxes owed on the year, it would be paid as a cash refund. This provision was not included, which hampers the value of the credit for some individuals. However, the credit can be rolled over to a following year.
There are also several “adders” for the tax credit depending on the type of organization, domestic product use, and project location. ROTH Capital Partners said that the investment tax credit could reach as high as 50% for some projects with the right adders applied.
The credit also includes the “direct pay” provision. This would allow a developer with little or no tax liability to treat the amount of credit as an overpayment of tax which would result in a cash payment refund in the amount of such overpayment being made to the developer.
“With long-term incentives for clean energy deployment and manufacturing, the solar and storage industry is ready to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and get to work building out the next era of American energy leadership. This is a crucial window of opportunity that we cannot miss, and now Congress must seal the deal and pass this legislation,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association.
The bill is expected to head to the Senate floor for a vote as early as next week.

GreenYellow's value is estimated at around €1.4 billion ($1.42 billion), Ardian said in a press release, without providing further details on the deal.
Prior to the transaction, Groupe Casino held a 72.3% stake in GreenYellow, while the remaining share was owned by French public investment bank Bpifrance and Paris-based asset manager Tikehau Capital.
“As part of the transaction, the Casino Group, incubator and reference shareholder of GreenYellow since 2007, will retain a minority stake and will remain a leading business partner for the company,” Ardian said. “Similarly, BPI and Tikehau, who became shareholders in 2018 when they identified GreenYellow's growth potential, will reinvest part of their proceeds in the company.”
In May, French financial daily Les Echos reported that French energy giants Engie and TotalEnergies had emerged as potential buyers.
GreenYellow, which recently raised €200 million of fresh funds, was set up by Groupe Casino in 2007. In 2016, the solar unit obtained authorization to implement the sale of power to final clients and power providers through its subsidiary, GreenYellow Vente d'Énergie. The company has mainly installed solar projects on the French mainland and in the nation's overseas territories as well as French-speaking Madagascar.
In 2018, GreenYellow and Engie set up a solar joint venture to develop PV projects for self-consumption purposes.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/28/uzbekistan-is-steaming-ahead-in-the-race-to-carbon-neutrality/,"MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UZBEKISTAN",,"JULY 28, 2022",Uzbekistan is steaming ahead in the race to carbon neutrality,"Uzbekistan can be described as a “good performer.” Since 2016, it has enacted significant economic, social, and political reforms and changes, and has promoted renewables, including solar. How are these actions paying off today?
An immediate, tangible, example of the dire need to act against climate change in Uzbekistan are the projected reductions in water resources and changes in rainfall patterns that are expected to lead to long droughts, thus putting significant portions of its population at risk of food and water insecurity.
Water shortages are causing diminishing crop yields that will be insufficient for the country’s fast-growing population. This problem is magnified by the drying up of the Aral Sea which has already lost 57% of its area, 80% of its volume and 64% of its depth over the past four decades.
To tackle this, the country has set very strong climate change targets via several initiatives that aim to reshape the energy mix. They include:
Uzbekistan has understood the challenge and the need for support in terms of funding and technology providers, hence the need to attract foreign investors. It is therefore worth exploring how the country has successfully managed this transformation and what is the current status of its renewable energy and PV markets there. This could offer interesting international growth opportunities to potential strategic partners.
Since arrival of the current President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in 2016, who was the former Prime Minister, re-elected in October 2021, the Government of Uzbekistan has adopted a mid-term development strategy, “The Strategy of Actions for 2017-2021.” In general, thanks to the comprehensive and deep economic reforms, the country’s economy has shifted from its former Soviet model to a more dynamic one, where the living standards of the population have significantly improved.
The reforms have also improved the investment climate, removed major market distortions, and unlocked potential for private entrepreneurship. As a result, Uzbekistan’s economy has become a much more open and market-oriented economy.
Here is a summarized list of the main reforms and investment-related laws necessary for promoting renewables that have been adopted over the last five years:

These reforms immediately translated into a radical restructuring of Uzbekenergo JSC, the State-owned, monopolistic, utility company. Three joint-stock companies have since been organized under the umbrella of the latter: Thermal Power Plants, National Electric Networks (Transmission operation) of Uzbekistan, and Regional Electric Networks (Distribution operator).
A new Decree 4477 has also been introduced to foster a green economy transition. It:
Changes to the country’s law in 2020 rapidly led to an overhaul of the tariff structure for the electricity and natural gas sectors. Like in many other countries, a differentiated flexible electricity tariff for the population by the time of day, working/weekend days was approved.
Thus, consumers now receive the right to conclude contracts either at a tariff differentiated by the time of day (when, as a rule, electricity is cheaper at night), or at a single rate tariff (that is, the same price of electricity during the day). In addition, a tariff differentiated by consumption volumes (using the base rate) is used.
At the end of 2020, the Concept Note for Ensuring Electricity Supply in Uzbekistan in 2020-2030 was also approved. This envisages an increase in generating capacity from 12.9 GW in 2019 to 29.3 GW in 2030. It is also planned to achieve up to 8 GW of electricity generated from renewables, comprising 3 GW of wind farms and 5 GW of solar farms.
However, these targets were not sufficient, so 2021 was announced as the year of the launch of country’s wholesale electricity market. In Q1 2021, a draft of Presidential Resolution “On Additional Measures to Reform the Electric Energy Industry” was announced which aims to establish a competitive electricity market in Uzbekistan between 2020 and 2025.
The draft provides for the establishment of an independent regulator in charge of electricity and natural gas, which will not be part of the government as it is today but will be subordinate to the president and the parliament. Beyond standard control and licensing roles, some relevant functions of this institution envisaged in the draft resolution are:
These changes open the doors to the implementation of the Concept of Transition to a Competitive Electricity Market for 2021-2025 which could lead to a competitive electricity market, improve the quality, reliability, and stability of power supply through effective management of the power industry by the transformation of state-owned companies, and form a competitive wholesale and retail power market.
The concept establishes the following models for the competitive wholesale electricity market:
This note has not yet been fully voted on due to the current geopolitical events but is underway.
Mixing ambitious sustainability targets (like carbon neutrality) and modern energy trading mechanisms requires significant investments whether from a grid perspective, or modernizing Soviet-era infrastructure, raising the quality and storage of power, and the management of technical intermittency.
In these respects, the laws passed in 2019 on renewable energy and PPPs have paved the way for numerous build–operate–transfer wind and solar tenders to be organized by 2022. Leading development finance institutions, like the International Finance Corporation, Asian Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, are supporting the government in these tenders.
To date, five tenders have been implemented for a minimum of 800 MW in wind and solar. These tenders consist generally in the design, financing, construction, operation, maintenance, and transfer of large-scale power plants. They have thus far been successful for the offtakers as they attracted leading developers such as Masdar, Acwa Power and Total Eren, with record low tariffs.

Having said that, one should not forget the risk for a government to offer a market to a restricted number of players. Allocating 92% of a whole sector to two companies does pose risks. Evidence of that is the bid ratio (number of final bidders to qualified applications) that the tenders attracted, which is low (sometimes up to 25% only) and between 4-10% if compared with Expressions of Interest. This means some partners will be discouraged, considering the competition too fierce and unbalanced.
See tables below for more details:

Uzbekistan plans to develop around 9.9 GW of renewables by 2030, of which 5.24 GW are to be tendered by 2030. Considering the former remarks, the government adapted the rules to more balanced proposals whereby one bidder can only be allocated one project for the segment they qualify have been imposed. This should promote the diversification of power suppliers.


In addition, laws have been adapted to ensure the bankability of projects over the tenders. For example, providing SPV creation was not part of the original model. Today, current tender models propose, among other benefits:
All these elements have been successful in mitigating a liquidity risk as individual finance institutes have confirmed appetite for long term PPAs structures.
A general sub-investment grade risk remains, particularly against the backdrop of the Russian invasion of Ukraine which has direct implications for Uzbekistan. These implications include rising external security risks given the potential for deteriorating political relations with Russia.
The war will also impact Uzbekistan economically due to an expected weaker external demand, higher inflation, and lower remittance inflows. However, the government has demonstrated strong resilience and perseverance in reform implementation to reach its targets.
The market appetite appears to be there and confirms the interest in stakeholders to participate in the transformation of the Uzbek power model.

GO is a compound of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen that is obtained by treating graphite with oxidizers and acids. It consists of a single-layer sheet of graphite oxide that is commonly used to produce graphene-family nanomaterials for various applications, including electronics, optics, chemistry and energy storage.
The scientists developed an ink of GO mixed with Nafion that can be spin-coated on an n-type silicon wafer to form a high-quality passivating contact scheme. “Low interface recombination is provided by the Nafion and carrier selection by the GO,” they explained, noting that the passivation scheme also includes an electron-selective passivation contact comprising n-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon with an indium tin oxide (ITO) overlayer aimed at improving light trapping and reducing surface recombination.

“Graphene was also shear force mixed in Nafion at a concentration of 8 mg mL–1,” they further explained. “Either of these inks were then spin-coated onto the back of the Si wafer, a thin film of Ag was evaporated on top of this and finally an electrical Ag paste was applied for encapsulation and to block the ingress of small quantities of water. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that the GO:Nafion layers completely covered the Si surface and a root mean roughness of 89 nm was recorded.”
According to the researchers, the GO:Nafion layer simultaneously creates a p–n junction with silicon and passivates the surface defects at the GO:Si interface. The graphene-silicon solar cell is reportedly able to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 18.8%. “Pseudo J–V curve shows a pseudo fill factor of 80.6% without the serious resistance effect, and potentially predicts that an efficiency of 21.59% could be achieved with further optimization.”
They presented the solar cell in the paper “High-Efficiency Graphene-Oxide/Silicon Solar Cells with an Organic-Passivated Interface,” published in Advanced Materials Interfaces. The research team comprises academics from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany, the Hebei University in China, and Chinese module manufacturer Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., Ltd. “The scalable fabrication and good wettability of the GO:Nafion ink provides a favorable direction toward development of carbon-based PV in the future,” they concluded.

Indian energy company NTPC has launched a tender for the construction of 1,150 MW of photovoltaic projects and 150 MW/150 MWh of storage capacity in Cuba.
NTPC, a corporate partner of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), was chosen as a preferred partner for the implementation of photovoltaic solar parks by the Cuban government.
In January, NTPC invited developers to submit bids to develop 900 MW of photovoltaics in Cuba. In principle, that tender covered the installation of solar parks distributed in 175 towns of the 15 provinces of the island.
Now that projection has been extended by an additional 250 MW, to which storage capacity has been added.
The project is part of the goal of implementing 2,100 MW of solar projects on the Caribbean island. Annual generation is expected to be 2,400 MWh.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Cuba had an installed PV capacity of 246 MW at the end of 2021.

The tension between Russia and Europe has continued to increase in the past month. The uncertainty around the reopening of the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany and increased risks in gas storage – whose levels in Europe are currently at 59% of its capacity, slightly below the 61% average of the 2015-2020 period, have led to a drastic rise in gas and electricity prices expected for 2023.
European governments have launched emergency plans and measures. Germany, for example, plans to reclaim 6 GW of reserve coal and oil power plants and is reassessing its exit from nuclear power, while Austria and other countries have approved state subsidies for affected industries. France has announced that it will fully nationalize energy company EDF, which owns most of national nuclear power assets.
The rise in gas and electricity prices, however, has not been reflected this time in PPA prices. The war continues to prevent the signing of PPAs and has caused prices to rise in most European markets, with Pexapark's Pexa EURO index posting an overall decline of 11.3% month-on-month for June.

The monthly Pexapark index also reported that Estonia saw its first PPA last month between Eesti Energia and Telia, while Denmark has been in the lead in terms of announcements.
In line with the trend of recent months, the vast majority of new contracts were driven by companies, accounting for nine of the 10 deals signed in June, with the remaining transaction carried out by a utility. Solar power dominated the June PPAs with six deals.
The total new capacity announced amounts to about 380 MW. However, most of the announcements did not reveal the exact capacity under the PPAs. The largest agreement by volume in June was between Statkraft and H2 Green Steel for the supply of 2 TWh per year of hydroelectric energy for seven years. These large volumes will be used to power a green hydrogen electrolyzer for green steel production in Sweden.
Analyzing the first six months of the year, Pexapark said there was a decrease of around 15% in PPAs and 44% less new capacity compared to the activity of the first half of 2021, which was the strongest to date.

Rays Power Infra, a Rajasthan-headquartered solar developer and EPC provider, has commissioned another 50 MW (AC) open-access solar plant in Karnataka after switching on an equivalent capacity in the state earlier this year.
The latest plant is located in Bennur and will supply power to industrial customers under long-term power purchase agreements.

The heat pump is electrically powered and can operate with zero CO2 emissions when powered by electricity from renewable sources.
“The heat pump utilizes waste heat from all sorts of industrial processes, including drying, distillation, and brewing, among others,” FutraHeat's CEO and founder, Tom Taylor, told pv magazine. “We can also take heat recovered from the ground, water, or air by a lower temperature heat pump and increase this to more practical temperatures.”
The core of the heat pump is FutraHeat's TurboClaw compressor, which the manufacturer describes as a cost-effective, zero-carbon solution to industrial process heating. “TurboClaw isn’t itself a steam compressor, although we have built such a machine and plan to commercialize this too in the future, but uses Honeywell’s Solstice R1233zd, ultra-low-global-warming-potential (LGWP) refrigerant in a closed loop system, which then generates steam via a heat exchanger,” Taylor explained. “The compressor itself is driven by an electric motor which directly spins TurboClaw up to a modest 20,000 rpm, ‘concentrating’ low-grade recovered heat up to higher, useful temperatures.”
US conglomerate Honeywell developed its refrigerant as a replacement for R-123, which has been phased out in several countries because of environmental concerns. “Honeywell’s Solstice Solstice R1233zd has a global warming potential of 1 and can operate up to temperatures in excess of 150 C,” Taylor said. “Its properties, such as density, make it a particularly good match for TurboClaw.” The refrigerant is based on hydrofluoro-olefin technology and, according to the manufacturer, offers similar efficiency to R-123 in low-pressure centrifugal chillers to cool large buildings and infrastructure.
The two companies claim the heat pump can operate at reduced speeds without oil, which lowers manufacturing, operating and heating costs. It can reportedly recover waste heat from as low as 70 C, and deliver high-grade heat up to 150 C. “Because of the advantages of TurboClaw we estimate that we can produce our heat pumps more cost effectively than others and deliver a quick return on investment in our target applications,” Taylor said, noting that payback time is estimated between two and three years.
Futraheat recently received a GBP 500,000 ($607,821) grant from Innovate UK to build a 300 kW TurboClaw demonstrator. “We expect it to be available for demonstration in September,” Taylor said.

Singapore-headquartered solar manufacturer Maxeon Solar Technologies, which sells in Australia under the SunPower Maxeon brand, said the partnership with Reclaim PV will ensure its panels that have come to the end of their useful lives will be recycled and not discarded into landfill.
With the rollout of rooftop and large-scale solar PV in Australia showing no signs of slowing, the number of end-of-life solar panels is destined to grow exponentially. Analysis from international consultancy firm Rystad Energy indicates that solar PV waste will grow to 27 million tonnes per annum by 2040. The Federal Government projects that in Australia, more than 1.5 million tonnes of solar PV waste will be generated each year by 2050. Currently, almost all broken or expired solar panels go into landfill.
Reclaim PV, which launched its first recycling facility in Adelaide last year and expects to collect more than 90,000 panels or the equivalent of 3,000 tonnes of PV modules in 2022, is among a suite of Australian companies looking to re-use or recycle solar panel materials.
Reclaim PV director Clive Fleming said the partnership with Maxeon is an important step forward in the responsible recycling of end-of-life solar panels. “Maxeon is one of the first manufacturers to adopt responsible recycling in their supply chain and to partner with Reclaim PV to help solve the PV recycling challenge that Australia is facing,” he said. “We look forward to continuing to work with them to keep solar panels out of landfill.”
Reclaim PV uses a recycling process known as pyrolysis – a thermal deconstruction technique that breaks down and separates PV panels into their component parts by passing them through a high-temperature furnace. Upon completion of the thermal extraction process, the recovered components are sorted and placed into collection bins for delivery to materials companies, ensuring all recoverable materials are available for re-use.
Fleming said Reclaim PV also provides services beyond collection and recycling with the company also compiling and storing information on the materials in the panels it recycles. This additional data collection service will help to build a complete and transparent picture of the materials being extracted from the solar panels and where they are supplied back into Australian supply chains, with a carbon offset value calculated to show the positive effects of recycling.
“The importance of the data recording and supply mapping process is that we are able to bring transparency to the material recovery and supply process and can now make informed decisions on how we can in part replace the use of virgin mined materials within other industries with recycled materials from solar panels,” Fleming said. “This is something that both Reclaim PV and Maxeon see as having huge potential for both the solar panel supply chain and the entire circular economy.”
Maxeon’s APAC vice president Chris O’Brien said the manufacturer’s partnership with Reclaim PV is a sign of the company’s commitment to a circular solar economy. “We take sustainability very seriously and continue to innovate by developing more efficient, more sustainable and longer-lasting panels that ease the burden of the recycling process and ensure a positive impact on people and the planet,” he said. “Our partnership with Reclaim PV in Australia is a tangible demonstration of our commitment to ESG principles and goals.”

Enphase Energy, a leading provider of solar microinverters and battery energy storage, announced record revenues in Q2 2022, beating expectations and quickly sending the company’s stock up 10% in after-hours trading.
The consensus for Enphase was $508 million in revenues and 85 cents per share. The Fremont, California-based company beat these numbers handily, posting 102% earnings per share growth at $1.07, and revenue growth of 67% with $530 million in revenues posted.
The growth was heavily influenced by rapid expansion in the European market, with second quarter growth of 69%. It was also supported by strong performance in the US market and the success of its IQ8 microinverter, which ROTH Capital Partners said has a 15% premium over the previous IQ7 model.
As of the end of 2021, Enphase has shipped 43.4 TWh of microinverters, representing over 42 million microinverter units, deployed across nearly 2 million solar projects. That number continues to grow, supported by strong interest in the IQ8 inverter, which can form a microgrid with a home solar array and no energy storage.
The IQ8 is a novel technology for its ability to keep the power running during a grid blackout without the need for energy storage or a generator. The device can react to real-time usage in the home and adjust accordingly. The system will feed as much electricity as it has access to based upon sunlight available and solar power capacity, and it will adjust on the fly. When too much energy from the house is being pulled – more than sunlight and installed capacity could provide – the whole system shuts down, only to instantly restart when the excess load is removed. This feature may be increasingly popular as power outages continue to rise, particularly across the western United States.
Looking ahead, the company issued very upbeat guidance for Q3 revenues, expecting between $590 million to $630 million. Enphase’s microinverter sales are expected to continue to bring the lion’s share of revenues in the near term.
Its energy storage segment lags some expectations as it said it estimates it will ship 130 to 145 MWh of battery energy storage in Q3 2022, slightly lower than ROTH’s previous estimate of 156 MWh. The company also operates in the EV charging segment and shipped 8,250 ClipperCreek/Enphase chargers to US customers. It said it expects healthy growth in this segment.
ROTH reissued its buy rating on the stock following the quarterly call and raised its 12-month price target from $270 to $310.
ROTH said factors that may slow Enphase on the progress towards its price target include lower than expected PV demand, unexpected decrease in inverter pricing or gross margins, a lack of available project financing for residential and commercial PV projects, or the accelerated adoption of competitive technologies like DC power optimizers.
The firm said Enphase trades at an elevated valuation due to its unique position as the globally dominant microinverter provider, with close to 100% market share of microinverters.
