But this week, the Italian car manufacturer presented an ambitious plan to offer electric versions of all of its models by 2025 and shift to EV-only sales by 2030. With such a timeline, Maserati is looking to become “the first luxury brand to complete its electric lineup by 2025”, all part of its parent Stellantis' 2030 strategic plan announced earlier this month. On top of that, the automaker announced its plans for the market launch of its electric range Maserati Folgore, with the next-generation GranTurismo sports coupe as the first EV to come out of that product lineup.
After creating a separate EV business, US-based Ford has announced plans for seven new electric models in Europe, a battery assembly site in Germany and a nickel cell manufacturing joint venture in Turkey. “Ford is all-in and moving fast to meet the demand in Europe and around the globe,” said Jim Farley, Ford's president and CEO. Following the introduction of the all-electric Mach-E in 2021 and Mach-E GT this year, plus the launch of the E-Transit in the next quarter, Ford unveiled plans for three new passenger vehicles and four new commercial vehicles to join the Ford family in Europe. Starting in 2023, Ford will begin production of an all-new electric passenger vehicle, a medium-sized crossover, built in Cologne with a second electric vehicle added to the Cologne production line-up in 2024. In addition, its top-selling passenger vehicle in Europe, the Ford Puma, will be available as an electric version made in Craiova, Romania, starting in 2024. As part of the major EV push on the European continent, the automaker will invest $2 billion into building new passenger car at its Cologne Electrification Centre in Germany, where it expects production to increase to 1.2 million vehicles over the next six years. The investment includes a new battery assembly facility scheduled to start operations in 2024. Finally, it also announced it is pushing forward with the production of its own EV batteries, through a joint venture business with SK On and Koç Holding to build one of the largest manufacturing plants for commercial vehicles in Europe. Located near Ankara, the plant would manufacture high nickel NMC cells for assembly into battery array modules. Production is intended to start as early as mid-decade with an annual capacity likely to be in the range of 30 to 45GWh.
Plans for another European gigafactory were floated earlier this week by Northvolt. This time around, the Swedish battery developer said it intends to establish a battery gigafactory in Heide, Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany, increasing its pipeline of battery manufacturing capacity under development to more than 170 GWh. With an annual potential production capacity of 60 GWh, Northvolt Drei will deliver a supply of sustainably produced lithium-ion batteries to the European market, sufficient for one million electric vehicles. The factory will source significant volumes of its raw material requirements from recycled battery metals, as part of Northvolt’s commitment to source 50% of its raw material needs from recycling by 2030. Alongside battery production, Northvolt Drei will target an on-site battery recycling plant which will ensure efficient reuse of byproducts from the production process and provide a sustainable solution for end-of-life EV batteries recovered from European markets. The German gigafab announcement comes only months after the first lithium-ion battery cell has rolled off Northvolt's production lines in Sweden.
Meanwhile, South Korea-based battery cell manufacturer Samsung SDI has started building a pilot line for solid-state batteries. Samsung SDI is planning facilities and systems for the production of cathodes and solid electrolytes as well as the introduction of new production processes there. The so-called ‘S-Line’ at Samsung SDI’s R&D center in the city of Suwon will be about 6,500 square meters in size. With the pilot production, Samsung SDI says it wants to achieve “market-leading research results and production technologies for solid-state batteries”. The company provides very little information with regard to the production capacity and the technology's development status in a short announcement issued earlier this week. Two years ago, Samsung SDI presented a solid-state pouch cell in a prototype stage said to be capable of 800km of range and cycle life of over 1,000 charges. Thanks to a new, ultrathin silver-carbon (Ag-C) coating on the anode, the Samsung team reported it had managed to increase energy density up to 900Wh/L and mitigate dendrite growth by reducing the anode thickness.
Indeed, solid-state batteries continue to garner interest in the automotive space with some legacy manufacturers describing them as one of the key levers for determining the cost, scalability, and energy density of EV batteries, and newcomers to the market looking to prove the technology's potential. This week, California-based Sakuu, developer of the 3D printed solid-state battery, announced the benchmark energy-density achievement of 800 Wh/L in its first-generation non-printed lithium metal battery. This marks a significant milestone on Sakuu’s roadmap to fully 3D printable solid-state batteries capable of greater than 1200 Wh/L by 2023, substantially surpassing lithium-ion batteries found in today’s top-selling EVs that function in a range of 500–700 Wh/L. “The arrival of a safe, sustainable, and high-performance SSB, manufactured with a totally novel 3D printing method can solve critical supply chain and safety issues while moving beyond limitations of today’s lithium-ion batteries,” states Robert Bagheri, Sakuu's founder and CEO. In addition to the 800 Wh/L mark, the first-generation lithium-metal battery is demonstrating high energy retention at 97% after 200 cycles. The battery, while remaining dendrite-free, is expected to record 80% retention at 800 cycles once cycling has been completed.
This week, Volkswagen AG‘s Chief Financial Officer Arno Antlitz revealed that some of the group's battery electric vehicles are sold out until 2023, whereas many other models require long wait times. “We see better scale, we see better margins, we see high customer demand. Originally we thought it takes two to three years until we see the parity of ICE and battery-electric vehicles,” he told Bloomberg. Last year, the group sold about 762,400 plug-in EVs, including 452,900 all-electric – up 95.5% year-over-year. However, due to supply chain crunches, Volkswagen Group might be forced to increase EV prices, just like many other of its competitors. “Raw materials are clearly a headwind for us. There might be also the time when we need to pass on some of the increases to the market,” Antlitz said.
A member of the VW Group, Porsche, updated on Friday its electrification plan with the release of its financial results. The German luxury sports car maker has now set a new goal for more than 80% of sales to be all-electric by 2030. After launching its first and currently only fully electric vehicle Taycan in 2019, Porsche is now looking to offer its 718 mid-engine sports car only as a fully electric version by 2025. Last year, the automaker delivered 301,915 vehicles globally and 41,296 of them were Taycan sedans, which sold even more than Porsche's 911 iconic sports car. Towards its electrification goals, Porsche noted that it is heavily investing with its partners in high-end charging stations as well as in the establishment of its own infrastructure. It also continues to make other significant investments in battery technology with its new Cellforce group focused on developing high-performance battery cells that should be ready for mass production by 2024.

South Korea-based solar module manufacturer Hanwha Q-Cells announced that the Dutch Court of Appeal in The Hague has upheld the cross-border injunction against Longi Netherlands Trading B.V. that was previously imposed in early October by the District Court of Rotterdam. According to the preliminary decision of the Court of Appeal, the list of countries in which Longi is not allowed to sell the solar modules affected by the patent infringement proceedings has been expanded from nine to eleven.
The injunction provides that Longi Solar's Dutch subsidiary may not encourage customers to infringe the EP ‘689 patent in countries where Hanwha Solutions Corporation is the registered owner. Longi is not allowed to offer for sale, sell or distribute the affected solar modules in Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, France, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Austria, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. In addition, Longi is to send a list of its customers in these countries to Hanwha Q-Cells.
Moreover, the Court of Appeal has ordered Longi NL to send recall letters to customers. According to Hanwha Q-Cells, they will be asked to return the modules affected by the patent dispute. The judges in The Hague ruled that Longi NL not only acted unlawfully in inciting customers to infringe the patent, but also directly infringed the EP ‘689 patent itself, as it sold its solar modules in countries where the patent was declared valid.
According to Hanwha Q-Cells, the Longi solar module types Hi-M03, Hi-M03m, Hi-M04, Hi-M04m, Hi-M05 and Hi-M05m could infringe the patent concerned and are subject to immediate reimbursement and must be returned to Longi NL. However, the solar module types HIH, HIB and HIBD will be excluded.
Hanwha Q-Cells reports that if Longi does not comply with the requirements, the verdict provides for a daily fine. The written list of customers and the recall letters to the customers will also have to be sent within two weeks after the judgment.
pv magazine asked Longi Solar for a statement on the court's decision. We will add the company's response as soon as we have it.
The patent dispute between the photovoltaic manufacturers dates back to spring 2019. In March 2019, Hanwha Q-Cells filed a patent infringement lawsuit in both Germany and the United States, and shortly afterward in Australia, against Longi, REC and a third defendent, JinkoSolar. According to the company, its three competitors have illegally used its patented technology in their products. In June 2020, the Regional Court of Düsseldorf in Germany ruled in favor of Hanwha Q-Cells in the first instance. REC and Longi Solar appealed against the decision, whereupon Hanwha Q-Cells initiated the preliminary enforcement of the decision. In Hanwha Q-Cells' view, Longi Solar and REC did not take sufficient measures to comply with the court-ordered recall obligation, which is why Hanwha applied for a fine.
That legal dispute, by which Hanwha Q-Cells wants to prevent the distribution of patent-infringing solar modules in European third-party countries, has been swelling since the summer of 2021. At that time, a court in Rotterdam ordered the seizure of a delivery of Longi solar modules.

The train will be tested on the Augsburg-Füssen route, among others, beginning in mid-2023. Pilot operations in the rail network of Bayerische Regiobahn (BRB) are initially planned for 30 months. The train is expected to officially enter passenger service as of January 2024,” Siemens Mobility wrote on Wednesday. The contract is a follow-up to the letter of intent signed in July 2021. The train deploys roof-mounted fuel cells and underfloor batteries supplied by Saft.
The Danish government has reached an agreement on Power-to-X, including a government tender for DKK 1.25 billion (€0.17 billion). Denmark plans to build up an electrolysis capacity of 4-6 GW by 2030. “High ambitions for green fuels are crucial to phase out fossil energy, reduce climate loads, support green growth and loosen Russia's grip on Europe's energy supply,” the Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities wrote on Tuesday. The government wants to launch the tender “as soon as possible”. With the new measure, the Danish government has approved a total of €400 million support for PtX technologies since 2019. “If we are to succeed, we must dare to take political decisions more quickly in the future,” commented Rasmus Helveg Petersen, Radical Party spokesman on climate, energy and supply. The Danish government floated the idea already at the end of January, but the agreement throughout the political spectrum suggests developments could accelerate, becoming the government's priority. The multi-party agreement aims to create green fuel for planes, ships and trucks both at home and abroad.
Germany and Norway agreed to conduct a feasibility study on large-scale hydrogen transport, including via pipeline. “In order to realise the fastest possible high-volume imports of hydrogen and ensure the rapid availability thereof, we will also jointly plan the use of blue hydrogen for a transition period. In this context, we will ensure environmental and climate integrity by establishing for example the highest possible standards for Carbon Capture and Storage,” reads the joint statement published on Wednesday. The two countries will also team up on offshore wind projects in the North Sea, also eyeing collaboration in the green hydrogen sector in the longer term, despite the current focus on blue hydrogen. 
State Premier Reiner Haseloff and Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Svenja Schulze handed over the approval notice for a green hydrogen plant in Saxony-Anhalt to German developer Getec green energy. The facility will be built on the former Zerbst military airfield, Saxony-Anhalt's government wrote on Wednesday. According to reports shared by the German state, the company will be investing €75 million to build, among other things, seven new wind turbines, a weather station, and a 16-kilometer pipeline.
The development of green hydrogen projects will strongly depend on location, wrote consultancy WoodMackenzie on Wednesday, commenting on the agreement between British oil and gas company bp and Oman. “With the entire green hydrogen value chain being nascent, getting access to the best location for consistent renewable power has a significant impact on project values. Therefore, the importance of capturing and analyzing the renewables data on a large scale is analogous to geological surveys aimed at identifying technically and commercially visible hydrocarbon reserves,” wrote Claude Mourey, director for Hydrogen and New Energies for the MENA region. WoodMackenzie's analysis suggests that Oman's green hydrogen levelized costs could reach less than US$2/kg by 2030. A stable mix of wind and solar adds to the other factors already outlined by previous research: water, proximity to export infrastructures and existing local demand for hydrogen.

Energy company China Power yesterday published full-year results for 2021 indicating it installed 1.22 GW more solar generation capacity last year while removing 1.2 GW of its coal plants, as soaring coal prices dragged the company into a loss-for-shareholders of RMB516 million (US$81.2 million). The company sold 7.09 TWh of solar electricity, 49% more than in 2020 – with associated businesses selling a further 108 GWh – for an average tariff of RMB0.469/kWh (US$0.074), down RMB0.103/kWh (US$0.016) from the previous year as subsidies were phased out. Nevertheless, China Power’s solar business posted a RMB574 million (US$90.3 million) profit as the coal operation lost RMB2.08 billion (US$327 million), with the utility stating: “The results of the group’s coal-fired power segment turned from profit to loss-making, dragging on the overall performance of the company.”
Polysilicon manufacturer GCL-Poly on Wednesday told the Singapore Stock Exchange its offer to buy back up to US$53.4 million of its own 10% senior notes, due in 2024, at a slight discount, had been oversubscribed.

All these characteristics make them potentially suitable for several applications, including their use in redox flow batteries.
A Dutch-Danish research team has used these compounds, which are also known as 1,2,4-benzotriazin-4-yl radicals, to build a prototype of a symmetric redox flow battery for applications in stationary storage. “Blatter radicals combine tunable redox potentials and high stability in all relevant redox states necessary for application as redox-active components in redox flow batteries,” the academics stated.
The scientists selected a single molecule that is intrinsically stable and that can accept or donate electrons, which means it can be used on both sides of the battery and, at the same time, show how minimal capacity fade during battery cycling.

The special compound was used in a small electrochemical cell and was found to remain stable over 275 charge/discharge cycles. “We need to bring this up to thousands of cycles; however, our experiments are a proof of concept. It is possible to make a symmetrical flow battery that has good stability,” said Edwin Otten, Associate Professor of Molecular Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Groningen.
“Another advantage of our symmetrical design is that it is not a big problem if some of our compound crosses the membrane during use,” explained Otten. “This could result in a slightly higher volume in one of the tanks but any imbalance is easily restored by simply reversing the polarity,”
A full description of the battery technology can be found in the study Blatter Radicals as Bipolar Materials for Symmetrical Redox-Flow Batteries, published in ACS Publications. The research group includes scientists from the University of Groningen and the University of Eindhoven in the Netherlands, as well as from the Technical University of Denmark. “We have shown that 1,2,4-benzotriazin-4-yl radicals combine bipolar electrochemistry with high chemical stability in all states of charge, which renders these compounds promising energy-storage materials for symmetric redox-flow batteries,” it concluded.
Looking forward, the academics are planning to develop a water-soluble version of the Blatter radicals.

“The modular system design also facilitates other printing and coating processes such as multi-nozzle dispensing or gravure printing,” the research institute said in a statement. “The potential applications of the new system extend far beyond the metallization of silicon solar cells.”
According to its creators, the new machine is able to achieve a cycle time of just 0.6 seconds per solar cell, which means a throughput increase by a factor of 1.5. “The machine has the technical potential to double the throughput compared to screen printing machines,” said Andreas Lorenz, project manager at Fraunhofer ISE.
“Metallization by screen printing is currently limited to a throughput of approximately 0.9 seconds per solar cell and line. This makes the printing step a bottleneck in the production process of silicon solar cells as well as in the printing process of single components in many other industries,” said Florian Clement, Head of Department Production Technology – Structuring and Metallization at Fraunhofer ISE.
The scientists also developed a special transport system for their new machine. It consists of transporting the printing components on autonomous shuttles at high speed and with precision through rotary printing units produced by Swiss engineering company Gallus Ferd. Rüesch AG, a Swiss machine engineering company which is part of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG. ” Depending on the specific requirements, a flexographic printing or a rotary screen printing unit can be used for the printing process,” the Fraunhofer ISE stated.

Another cell type, heterojunction (HJT) is also at the center of the move, with big plans in place – for European manufacturing projects in particular.
HJT holds most of the records for silicon solar cell efficiency, and bringing its costs down has been a key focus for researchers in recent years. This week saw the publication of new analysis from scientists led by Saudi Arabian university KAUST discussing the technical and economic factors and challenges remaining in the way of mass production for HJT. Their full analysis is published in Joule. As previous studies have noted, they find that higher initial investment for production equipment and high silver consumption are among the biggest concerns, alongside wafer quality, process control, dependence on indium, and processes for low-temperature cell interconnection.
Further HJT analysis published this week came from Australia’s University of New South Wales, which examined the possible adoption of transition metal oxide layers, deposited using atomic layer deposition. “Using a bottom-up cost and uncertainty model with equipment cost data and process experience in the lab, we find that the production cost of these variations will likely be lower per wafer than standard HJT, with the main cost drivers being the cost of the ALD precursors at high-volume production,” the group explained.
The analysis is published in full in Progress in Photovoltaics. While the group finds that lower per-cell production cost would likely be possible with this approach, whether it can really amount to a cost reduction would depend on the cell efficiency that can be achieved with the as-yet uncommercialized transition metal oxide technology. They note that one part of their approach – replacing indium tin oxide with aluminum zin oxide as the transparent conducting layer – has particular potential as it would eliminate the need for rare and costly indium.
Over in the United States, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) this week offered an annual update into its DuraMAT program, first launched in 2016 in consortium with Sandia National Laboratories and the Berkeley Lab in California, to focus on module durability and lifetimes.

Among the project’s successes in 2021 was a procedure to validate stress testing of backsheet materials, by comparing samples post lab-based stress testing with others that had failed in the field, to compare the stress tests against actual field conditions. In 2021 the project also received an additional $36 million in funding from the US department of energy, and says it will shift focus to confirming the reliability of newly introduced PV technologies. “Solar needs to keep improving, and product development cycles can be a lot faster than reliability testing cycles,” said DuraMAT director Teresa Barnes. “We need to find a way to assess reliability and durability at the speed of product development as the industry scales up rapidly.”
The project’s long term goal is to facilitate modules that last for 50 years – and its likely one that much of the PV industry shares, with a recent push from manufacturers to extend the current standard 25-year performance warranties to 30 years, with one manufacturer even issuing a 40 year warranty this year. Barnes is also keen to state that the DuraMAT project also operates with sustainability and practicality firmly in mind. “We know there are going to be big material and energy impacts from ramping up deployment as fast as we need for the energy transition,” she said. “But our question is, ‘How can we do that in a way that’s environmentally sustainable and in a way that our supply chain can keep up?’”

French Minister for Ecological Transition Barbara Pompili announced on March 17 a plan to reduce the grid fee for renewable energy sources, heat pumps and EV charging stations.
The measure is part of the French government's Climate and Resilience Law Climate intended to help households and businesses cope with the current energy crisis.
Over the next days, an ad-hoc decree is to be published and the measure is expected to include all PV systems not exceeding 500 kW in size, which are already being supported through feed-in tariffs. Currently, PV system owners are paying 60% of the grid fee to connect their installations and, with the new measure, they will pay only 40%.
Similarly, connection costs will be reduced for electric charging stations and for the installation of heat pumps, which will likely only pay 20% of the grid fee.
“The connection grid fee can be a brake on the deployment of certain small renewable electricity production projects as well as the installation of heat pumps, the development of which is nevertheless an essential issue in our energy policy,” said Pompili. “Reducing connection costs will make it possible to speed up their installations, especially in rural areas. This is a concrete step forward in advancing the country's energy transition.”

In Brazil, there are two commercial environments in the electricity market: the Regulated Contracting Environment (ACR) and the Free Contracting Environment (ACL). In the first case, distributors buy energy through auctions and the price is determined by the National Electricity Agency (Aneel). In ACL (Ambiente de Contratação Livre), consumers negotiate power purchase agreements (PPAs) directly with generators or trading companies.
According to a recent report from Sao Paulo-based consultancy CELA Clean Energy Latin America, the contracts for large-scale wind and solar projects in the ACL grew by 2.6 GW (37%) between January 2021 and February 2022.
The study is based on interviews and questionnaires carried out by the largest renewable energy generation companies in the country and provides information and analysis on 91 PPAs already signed in the free market for wind and solar photovoltaic, equivalent to an average of 2.6 GW. It reports that 34 of the contracts were for wind power and 57 for solar power.
Overall, bilateral PPAs related to wind and solar reached an installed capacity of 10.7 GW, which corresponds to 41% of the total wind and solar capacity of Brazil, which is currently of around 26.1 GW.
“In 2021 and 2022, the performance of the wind and solar photovoltaic sector in the free energy market has been consolidated, and companies are not only more prepared to develop these PPAs, but also to understand the main needs of energy consumers,” said Marilia Rabassa, director of CELA.

“Our research project is still in an early phase and some testing has not yet started, for example, field testing outdoors, testing of mechanical properties, and testing of ice adhesiveness,” the project manager, Arvid Olofsson, told pv magazine. “However, we plan to proceed with those parts during 2022 and also to explore several different coating technologies, both in the lab and through outdoor experiments.”
The coating technologies that currently are under development and testing are hydrophobic, superhydrophobic and slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS). While the hydrophobic concept relies on a smooth surface, the superhydrophobic effect is achieved through the formation of air pockets between the surface and the snow or ice layer, which requires a suitable surface structure. As for the SLIPS tech, the snow or ice layer is in contact with a lubricant that is held in place by the porous structure in the coating. “Additional coating technologies might be considered at a later stage in the project,” Olofsson added.
According to him, there are pros and cons to all types of coatings. Hydrophobic coatings, for example, are durable and commercially available. However, they have lower performance in terms of ice and snow repellency compared to state-of-the-art coatings. Superhydrophobic coatings have shown the ability to shed ice, but their durability is a challenge.
A disadvantage of superhydrophobic surfaces, for example, is that the surface structure can easily be damaged when it is exposed to abrasion during, for example, ice removal. “If the surface structure is damaged, the superhydrophobic properties are lost and the effect could be reversed so that water drops and ice sit even harder than on an uncoated smooth surface,” the research group emphasized.
As for the SLIPS surfaces, Olofsson they have shown extremely low ice adhesion values in previous research, but the challenge is to resist lubricant depletion with time.
The developed coating should exhibit anti-reflective properties to which snow and ice repellent properties will be added without severely impairing the optical properties of the glass cover. “Ideally, the coating should also be chemically and mechanically robust and have a service lifetime that corresponds to that of the PV module,” Olofsson added. “In addition, we will benchmark the developed coatings against two or three commercial coatings, and we will primarily work with glass substrates.”
The goal of the new technology is to halve ice adhesion compared to standard modular glass and ensure 96% light transmittance. “Our aim is that coated modules in operation should not accumulate any snow or ice if installed with a tilt angle of 10 degrees or more,” Olofsson explained, noting that research work will also include optimization of coating thickness and the choice of proper binders and lubricants.
The coatings will be tested outdoors in Norrland, the northernmost region of Sweden, where weather conditions are harsh and the snow load on PV systems can be considerable. “During the winter in Sweden, both the electricity demand and the electricity price are generally higher compared to the summer, which makes winter produced solar electricity particularly valuable,” Olofsson stated.
The research project is being supported by the Swedish Energy Agency Energimyndigheten.

The agrivoltaic facility is expected to range in capacity from 1 to 3 MW and will have to be designed to comply with landscape requirements and the agricultural practices of NeoruraleHub, which applies a blue economy model to agriculture. According to a definition given by the World Bank, the blue economy is the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods and jobs while preserving the health of ocean ecosystem.
“For us, agrivoltaics do not mean joining two worlds but creating a new one, where energy is not produced at the expense of either the soil, the landscape, nor agricultural production, but it means a new solution that optimizes the two distinct ones in a logical virtuous,” said Piero Manzoni, founder and CEO of NeoruraleHub.
“Italy can be a living laboratory,” Alessandra Scognamiglio, coordinator of the task force on sustainable agrivoltaics at Italian research agency ENEA, told pv magazine in October. He stressed that Italy has ambitious energy objectives but is constrained by two factors: having the world's highest concentration of UNESCO sites, and globally popular agricultural production.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/18/polo-ibc-solar-cell-with-23-7-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 18, 2022",POLO-IBC solar cell with 23.7% efficiency,"A group of scientists from the Leibniz Universität Hannover and the Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH) in Germany has developed two different kinds of solar cells based on n-type doped electron-collecting poly-Si on oxide (POLO) junctions with an aluminum-alloyed p+ junction for hole collection — a back-contacted back junction cells (POLO-BJ) and an interdigitated back-contacted cells (POLO-IBC).
“We developed both technologies in parallel, as their process flow is very similar and the development showed many synergies,” Robby Peibst, the research project's corresponding author, told pv magazine. “One of the main motivations for the parallel development was certainly risk minimization, as initially, it was not certain that we would be able to solve the respective challenges. For the POLO-BJ device, for example, the question was whether it was really possible to print an aluminum finger grid so thin that it would be suitable as the front-side metallization of a high-efficiency solar cell, which now seems to be the case.”
The scientists explained that the aluminum-alloyed p+ junction for hole collection is the standard in the manufacturing of PERC solar cells and can be inexpensively formed during the metallization process without the necessity for boron diffusion or silver metallization. Through simulation-based sensitivity analysis on the quality of these hole-collecting junctions, the German group was able to ascertain that the reduction of Al-p+ recombination and resistance is of high importance for both cell structures. “A reduction of pre-factor of the recombination current density from current values of 600 (830) fA/cm2 down to 400 fA/cm2 is compatible with a high-efficiency potential of 25.4% for POLO-IBC and 24.6% for POLO-BJ,” it further explained. “We conclude that the optimization of the quality of the Al-p+ region is a solvable challenge and not a road blocker. An even better quality of the Al-p+ region would facilitate even higher efficiencies.”
The champion POLO-IBC device developed by the academics achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.71%, an open-circuit voltage of 711.5mV, a short-circuit current of 41.3mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 80.9%. The best-performing POLO-BJ cell reached an efficiency of 22.9%, an open-circuit voltage of 714mV, a short-circuit current of 39.6mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 80.9%.
“The IBC cells required an additional patterning step and the development of a ‘non-standard' module interconnect technology,” Peibst emphasized. “Therefore, POLO-BJ initially seemed to us to be a more obvious upgrade to PERC.” According to him, however, there is currently a significant momentum in the industry towards IBC cells. “Nevertheless, double-side contacted cells will certainly continue to dominate at least in the mid-term. Perhaps POLO-BJ could be the first upgrade of a PERC line, and POLO-IBC a subsequent version,” he affirmed.
The solar cell was described in the paper On the chances and challenges of combining electron-collecting nPOLO and hole-collecting Al-p+ contacts in highly efficient p-type c-Si solar cells, published in Progress in Photovoltaics. “I personally see it as an attractive option that parts of our development can flow into mass production,” Peibst went on to say. “If, for example, we can successfully demonstrate with POLO-BJ that front-side metallization with Al fingers is possible and allows stable module interconnection, this would also be an option for saving silver in n-type TOPCon cells. Our work on Al metallization of poly-Si is also relevant for this purpose.”
The same research group recently conducted a series of numerical simulations to assess how photonic crystals may increase the efficiency of IBC solar cells based on POLO junction at the minus contact of the cell and a hole-selective p+-type POLO junction at the plus contact. The simulated cell was assumed to rely on a standard wafer thickness of 150 μm and the scientists found it may achieve an efficiency of over 28% under normal incident light.

The solar generating station that went online this week will bring Stanford University to an 80% reduction in campus greenhouse gas emissions, as part of a complete overhaul of the university’s entire energy system, and it brings the university to 100% renewable electricity.
This milestone of 100% renewable electricity is a major step toward our goal of net zero emissions by 2050.  Stanford has worked to transform its campus into a living laboratory for environmental action and aims to model sustainability across all aspects of campus life.  Lincoln Bleveans, executive director of sustainability and energy management expressed hope that these efforts will also provide insights that help other universities, jurisdictions and entities looking to transition to a zero-carbon future.
The 67MW Stanford Solar Generating Station No. 1 in Rosamond, California, went online in 2016. In 2017, 5MW was installed on rooftops on campus. And the Stanford Solar Generating Station No. 2, which went online this week, is an 88MW array near Lemoore, California, through a power purchase agreement with Recurrent Energy.
Stanford embarked on this path in the 1980s, when it implemented net metering on its facilities for the purpose of understanding how and where energy was being used. In 2009, the university released its long-range energy and climate action plan. That plan is now in its third edition and includes high-efficiency standards for new buildings, continued efficiency improvements for existing buildings, and the cutting-edge energy supply system known as the Stanford Energy System Innovations (SESI) project.
SESI moved the university from a 100% fossil-fuel-based combined heat and power plant to grid-sourced electricity and a more efficient electric heat recovery system. SESI uses the technology roadmap for building heating and cooling recommended by the International Energy Agency, which the United Nations Environment Programme also recently discussed in a comprehensive report for district-level implementation.
Stanford was recognized in 2021 as one of only 11 US universities to achieve the “platinum” rating and is the top-ranked doctoral university in the “energy” category in the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education’s (AASHE) 2021 Sustainable Campus Index. It has also taken further steps as it transitions to clean energy.
It was the first US college or university to issue bonds carrying dual climate and sustainability designations for financing campus construction and renovation projects in 2021 ($375 million). And the school has a goal of zero waste by 2030, which is defined as 90% diversion of waste away from the landfill.
The current diversion rate is approximately 67%, of which waste is composted, reused, or recycled. In addition, Stanford has implemented a water conservation plan that reduced total campus potable water use by 48% since the program began in 2001.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/18/concentrating-solar-power-with-heat-storage-could-compete-with-batteries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"MARCH 18, 2022",Concentrating solar power with heat storage could compete with batteries,"From pv magazine USA
Concentrating solar power plus thermal energy storage (CSP+TES) could be cost-competitive with battery storage for achieving a low-cost, 100% renewables grid in the continental United States, researchers have found.
For seasonal storage, power-to-gas-to-power had lower costs than CSP+TES. The researchers used a simple model of the grid that assumed free lossless transmission across the continental United States. They said that their results could guide future studies using more detailed models, and expected that a model realistically representing transmission would not fundamentally alter the relative roles of the generation and storage technologies they evaluated. The study was published in the journal Advances in Applied Energy.
With CSP, mirrors direct sunlight onto receivers containing a heat transfer fluid, and the heat is used to run a steam turbine. Adding thermal energy storage allows electricity to be generated later.
CSP alone costs more than solar PV, and when researchers ran the model without TES, it selected no CSP. But TES costs less than battery storage, and when TES is added to CSP, the technology combination becomes competitive with batteries, the study found. The system cost savings of adding CSP+TES to a system with batteries was slight, at only $0.07/kWh.
For increased uptake of the combined technology, cost reductions for CSP would be more important than cost reductions for TES. Yet ongoing cost reductions for batteries, as projected by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), would counter increased uptake of CSP+TES.
With power-to-gas-to-power (PGP) technology, renewable power is used to generate hydrogen from water, using electrolyzers. The hydrogen is later used to generate electricity using fuel cells, in the approach modeled by the researchers.
Seasonal storage needs in a 100% renewables grid were met with PGP storage capacity reaching 89,000GWh, the model showed. Short term-storage, typically with daily cycling, was met with far less capacity: 620GWh of thermal energy storage capacity, supplying 0.6% of total electricity supply, and 350GWh of battery storage capacity.
Demand response was represented in the model by allowing the system to supply less than the historical use profile “by paying a high cost.” Efforts to increase demand flexibility “could minimize the value” of CSP+TES, the authors said.
When methane gas units at varying percentages of generation were permitted, in a sensitivity analysis, the model selected batteries when methane gas generation was reduced to 5%, selected PGP with methane gas at or below 2%, and selected CSP+TES with methane gas at or below 0.1%.
The open-access article presents all cost elements for the generation and storage technologies considered. It is titled “The role of concentrated solar power with thermal energy storage in least-cost highly reliable electricity systems fully powered by variable renewable energy.”

The renewable power division of Goldman Sachs said that it has started commercial operations at the Slate solar and energy storage project in California.
The 390MW solar and 140.25MW/561MWh battery storage facility is one of the largest in the state. The project, which began development in 2015, was originally developed by Recurrent Energy, a subsidiary of PV manufacturer Canadian Solar.
The Kings County solar facility has five power purchase agreements (PPA) attached to several California-based organizations: the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), Stanford University, and the Power and Water Resources Authority (PWRPA), a publicly owned organization. PWRPA has energy demand that fluctuates from 20MW to 120MW from winter to summer, consuming 290GWh to 520GWh of energy per year to convey, treat and recycle water for their growers and consumers.
Stanford University said it recently achieved 100% renewable energy operations. The university is targeting net zero emissions by 2050.
Central Coast Community Energy and Silicon Valley Clean Energy are also served by the project’s PPA. The organizations both offer opt-in contracts for customers who desire a higher share of renewable energy generation attached to their electric bills.
“Slate is a landmark project that will help California meet its leading renewable energy targets. We started developing Slate in 2015, and we’re proud that this project was contracted as one of the first utility-scale solar and energy storage projects in the state, thanks to the forward-thinking leadership among the projects’ customers.” said Shawn Qu, chairman and CEO of Canadian Solar.
The project is expected to generate enough power for 126,000 California homes, displacing roughly 369,310 metric tons of carbon per year in the process. Over the past year, the project has employed 405 workers at peak construction, 90% of which were local King’s County residents. Skilled tradespeople from local unions were hired for the construction.
Goldman Sachs’ renewable team was established in 2017 and has now sponsored more than 2.6GW of capacity across 850 solar and storage projects in 27 states.
