The global energy storage market is expected to enter a “prolonged period of growth” this year, with annual installations reaching more than 30 GW by 2030, up 250% from 2021 levels. That’s according to a new report from IHS Markit.
The firm forecasts that the energy storage industry will notch rapid growth this year, with installations topping 12 GW. That would be an increase of more than 7 GW from 2020. Annual global installations are forecast to exceed 20 GW in 2024 and 30 GW by 2030.
The company said its outlook is underpinned by a growing number of national energy storage targets linked to stronger decarbonization goals. It said of particular note was China’s recently announced 30 GW energy storage target by 2025, which will help Asia to account for a growing share of global demand in the coming five years.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has said investment over the next decade will be critical in determining long-term hydrogen objectives. “Every year until 2030, investments of $7 billion in electrolyzers will be required (30 times recent record investments), and $4 billion in FCEV [fuel-cell electric vehicle] deployment will be needed (14 times record investments),” the IEA wrote in its Global Hydrogen Review 2021, published last week. “To achieve net zero emissions by 2050, global cumulative investments must increase to $1.2 trillion by 2030 and $10 trillion by 2050.” In the executive summary of the report, the IEA said global electrolyzer capacity, which doubled in the last five years to reach just over 300 MW by mid-2021, needs to accelerate. “Around 350 projects currently under development could bring global capacity up to 54 GW by 2030,” added the report. “Another 40 projects, accounting for more than 35 GW of capacity, are in early stages of development. If all those projects are realized, global hydrogen supply from electrolysers could reach more than 8 Mt by 2030. While significant, this is still well below the 80 Mt required by that year in the pathway to net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 set out in the IEA Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector.” The IEA wrote, Europe is leading electrolyzer capacity deployment, with 40% of global installed volume, and is set to remain the largest market in the near term, while Australia, Latin America, the Middle East, the U.S., and China could catch up in the long term. On the other hand, Canada and United States are the leaders in the carbon capture, storage and use technology needed for blue, natural gas-fired hydrogen production.
Swedish bearing and seal manufacturer SKF is teaming up with Luleå University of Technology to develop fossil-free steel for bearings. SKF will fund research on hydrogen use in industrial processes from the university’s CH2ESS initiative. It will also take part in research to speed up the development of fossil-free bearing steel. “Mechanical components are very important to ensure … function and operation in future hydrogen systems,” Victoria Van Camp, president of SKF Technology said in a press release today. Research areas will include hybrid ceramic bearings, and electric vehicles. The two partners will also develop and commercialize fossil-free bearing steel production. “SKF’s expertise in fluid machinery, material science, production technology and IoT [internet-of-things] solutions will actively contribute to the work,” added the press release.
London-based green H2 business Octopus Hydrogen, U.K.-focused, U.S. private equity-backed solar developer Innova Renewables, and Gloucestershire-headquartered renewables consultant Novus have formed a strategic partnership to build green hydrogen production facilities alongside their 4 GW of U.K. solar, wind, and battery projects. Octopus Hydrogen, part of London-based asset management business Octopus Energy Group, will design, build and operate hydrogen production plants at several of Innova’s renewables sites, said the companies, adding that electrolyzers will typically be between 2 and 20 MW in scale. “The green hydrogen production facilities will be directly connected to on-site renewable energy [generation] which will be purchased via long term power purchase agreements, producing between 500 and 2,500 kg of hydrogen per day,” read an announcement today.
In preparation for the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow next month, the British government has announced measures to support climate action and energy transformation. Last week, it awarded funding to 15 projects to help U.K. airports handle new types of electric and hydrogen aircraft. “In the future, we believe there will be a hydrogen-electric engine in every aircraft as this is the only viable way to deliver truly zero-emission aircraft and to comprehensively tackle the industry’s growing climate impact,” said Val Miftakhov, chief executive of the U.S.-based ZeroAvia company which is designing such aircraft. “When we deliver our first hydrogen-electric powertrains into service, in 2024, operators need to be able to fuel their aircraft with low-carbon hydrogen, and today’s announcement is a big step towards that.” U.K. prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce at the Conservative Party conference that all of Britain’s electricity will come from renewables by 2035.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Moroccan Research Institute for Solar Energy and New Energies have signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on renewables, green hydrogen, and new technology. “The EBRD is fully committed to supporting the development of green hydrogen value chains,” said Harry Boyd-Carpenter, EBRD managing director for the green economy and climate change, last week. “In combination with competitive renewable electricity, green hydrogen is a key ingredient in accelerating the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors and has strong potential in Morocco. We are very pleased to start our cooperation with [the Moroccan Research Institute for Solar Energy and New Energies].”
Lifte H2, a company focused on hydrogen supply chains, is expanding its presence in Berlin and Boston while launching a ‘technology-differentiated hydrogen infrastructure development service.' “In an industry where hydrogen-specific product and project experience is hard to come by, Lifte provides a unique combination of relationships, experience, technology, and capabilities,” said CEO and co-founder Matthew Blieske in a press release yesterday. The company expects to double the size of its workforce by early next year, to meet demand.

The project, approved by the executive committee of the National Economic Council headed by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, will be majority funded with Indian credit.
Applicants for the contract must have worked on supervising the development of a solar project with a generation capacity of at least 25 MW within the last 10 years, on the basis of a single contract, and to have included supervision of construction of an electricity transmission line of at least 132 kV and 10 km. Consultants can also bid as part of a consortium as long as the lead partner has experience of preparing tender documents and design, review, and approval services.
The successful consultant will have to review a project feasibility study drawn up by Dhaka-based EQMS Consulting Limited; prepare drawing design specifications of an engineering, procurement and construction tender document for the 100 MW solar plant and 132 kV, double circuit transmission line; and supervise the transmission line and substation installation works, among other duties. The deadline for bids is on October 24.
The Indian government will reportedly supply $131 million of soft loans towards the estimated $177 million cost of the 325-acre solar project, planned chiefly on Ministry of Land-owned fallow fields near the Jamuna river.
The government of Bangladesh will directly contribute $40 million to the project with the state-owned Rural Power Company supplying a further $5.9 million.
The plant is due to come online in December 23 and government officials have stated the authorities are planning a second, Chinese-backed 100 MW solar site nearby.
Rural Power Company MD Abdus Sabur said the Jamuna river project will generate electricity for the nearby districts of Mymensingh and Dhaka.
Bangladesh has around 775.84 MW of clean power generation capacity, around 3% of its power mix, and aims to source 40% of its electricity from renewables by 2050.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/05/sunways-talks-new-pv-inverter-products-manufacturing-plans-and-strategic-direction/,"INVERTERS,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,EUROPE,INDIA",VINCENT SHAW,"OCTOBER 5, 2021","Sunways talks new PV inverter products, manufacturing plans, and strategic direction","Li Kui, Vice President, Global Sales and Marketing, Sunways: This year, we will present large current inverters and storage inverters for large power output PV modules like the 182 mm and 210 mm products. Sunways is now the first company to successfully lift the current of residential inverters to 15 A which can better fit large-size panels on residential rooftops. Meanwhile, our storage products, including the single-phase inverters in our STH series (ranging from 3 to 8 kW) and three-phase inverters (ranging from 4 to 33 kW) are the only storage inverters using string technology and which possess a large power output.
To meet the complicated grid requirements from different countries, our products have been designed with a series of industry-leading features to maximize performance redundancy. For example, our inverters provide a maximum of two times AC overloading ability, 0~110% phase unbalanced output, seamless on and off grid switchover, and are also supportive of multiple inverters paralleling connection on the back-up side. All these features integrated in our hybrid inverters makes our products highly adaptable.
One of our advantages is that we react quickly to new technologies and new scenarios. For example, along with the development of 182 mm and 210 mm sized PV panels, our new products were quickly developed for higher currents and larger power. We also take efficiency and reliability – two most important characteristics of PV inverters for both PV and storage – very seriously. The temperature control of Sunways’ products is good – usually 5 to 10 degrees centigrade lower than our competitors – which ensures our inverters are both high efficiency and operate reliably. We further provide cloud-based monitoring platforms for our customers’ daily O&M needs, if required.
Currently, Europe, China, Latin America, Australia, and India are our target markets. Particularly the European and Australian markets are core for our storage inverters. In the future, Sunways will also develop new products for the U.S. market. We currently serve markets in over 50 countries and this figure continues to grow. Our shipment to the European market accounts for over 50% of our total output. Next May, a new production base located in China’s Cixi City, Zhejiang Province will be finished and production will commence. Here, we plan for at least 5 GW of PV inverter capacity which will help Sunways serve more customers globally.
String inverters are starting to take the place of centralized inverters and will eventually dominate the market, due to their advantages, which include being lightweight, and easy to install and maintain. With increasingly different types of energies and power loads, power grids are confronted with more challenges regarding safety, stability, and reliability.
As the brain of a solar PV system, hybrid inverters connect PV arrays, batteries, power loads, meters, and the utility grid, and control the energy flows, which can optimize system operations and solve instability problems associated with PV generation. They will also help lower system levelized costs of electricity (LCOEs) and eventually push smart home development.
Sunways has developed a series of products with intelligent monitoring via operations and maintenance (O&M), covering PV inverter and storage inverter products that are focused on the distributed PV sector. For example, we have the STS series of residential PV inverters ranging from 1 to 11 kW. For small Commercial & Industrial (C&I) projects, we offer inverter products with power ranging from 4 to 25 kW, and for larger C&I projects and for the utility-scale sector, we offer the STT series of inverters, ranging from 50 to 125 kW. We also provide storage inverters (via the STH series) ranging from 3 to 8 kW, single-phase high voltage inverters for residential PV projects, and three-phase high voltage products (ranging from 4 to 33 kW) for business customers.
We plan to develop 1500 V inverters for the distributed smart micro-grid sector soon, based on our optimistic view of this market in the coming decades.
Sunways was established in 1993 in Konstanz, Germany, and focused its business on the manufacture of PV components, including solar cells, PV panels, and inverters. Affected by the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties applied in 2012, Sunways experienced difficulties and was eventually acquired by Shunfeng Clean Energy in 2014. Since then, we have established a professional and experienced workforce at Sunways, partially based on its original German team and with professionals who transferred from PV module manufacturer Suntech. Meteocontrol further helps provide the highest level of meteorological support for our products, upon the customer’s request.
By 2018, Sunways achieved its vision: “Energy Connects All”. Our products and services now cover PV inverters, storage inverters, smart meters, PV monitoring and O&M equipment, among others.
When we talk about “Made in Germany”, the first impression is safety, reliability, and excellent quality. Sunways has tried very hard to maintain these qualities. Firstly, all our products are designed using German technologies and professionals. With the right integration of hardware and software, our inverter products are stable and achieve high conversion rates.
Secondly, we implement strict product standards and tests throughout the entire manufacturing process. This not only ensures our products and solutions are of high quality, but that they also meet all environmental requirements. Meanwhile, we imported and deployed Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) in our production which has helped to improve both yield and quality.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/05/rate-of-indian-commercial-and-industrial-solar-installation-fell-34-in-the-second-quarter/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 5, 2021",Rate of Indian commercial and industrial solar installation fell 34% in the second quarter,"From pv magazine India
Commercial and industrial (C&I) solar clients installed just 332 MW of solar generation capacity in the April-to-June window, to post a 34% retreat from the 501 MW added by businesses in the first three months of the year.
The second quarter figure comprised 127 MW of ‘open-access', off-site solar projects and 205 MW of rooftop panels, according to India Corporate Renewable Brief compiled for the second quarter by analyst Bridge To India.
The latest installation data indicates India’s cumulative C&I solar capacity reached 10,817 MW by June 30. That figure is split between 4,595 MW of open-access solar and 6,222 MW of rooftop arrays.
The Bridge to India report cited lockdowns in multiple states as the main reason for the reduced installation level in the second quarter and the analyst has predicted more activity in the last quarter and the current three-month window, due to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.
According to the report, the price for mono-PERC modules rose to $0.255/W (INR18.93) in the second quarter, 4% higher than in the January-to-March period. The total engineering, procurement and construction cost for C&I solar rose 3%, according to the analyst, to INR32.69/W for open access arrays and INR39/W for rooftop systems.
Bridge to India expects costs to have fallen 8-10% last quarter, thanks to the expiry of a 14.5% safeguarding duty imposed on solar imports which came to an end on July 30. However, the analyst pointed out, solar developers face a huge challenge in securing supply as Chinese manufacturers appear reluctant to book fresh orders.

An Energy Sector Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality in China considers two possible paths to achieving the climate change ambitions announced by Chinese president Xi Jinping last year: An ‘announced policy scenario' (APS) based on stated government ambitions, and a more ambitious ‘accelerated transition scenario' (ATS) which illustrates the potential for China to turbocharge its net zero goal.
Interestingly, while the report repeatedly emphasizes the importance of China working hand in hand with its global partners to combat climate change, the section devoted to persuading Beijing decision-makers to go for the raised ambitions of the ATS route, dangles the carrot of continued global domination of the clean energy sector.
Pick up your copy of the October edition of pv magazine for an in-depth look at the fire hazard concern of lithium-ion battery systems, with a focus on the blaze at Australia’s Victorian Big Battery which caught the world’s attention. Also, Saul Griffith, the guru of electrification, talks to pv magazine about reshaping the climate conversation; we delve into the evolution of residential PV in China; and we continue our coverage of global PV supply-chain issues and ask: Is there an alternative to Made in China?
“China's central role in the global clean energy technology value chains, as both a technology developer and producer, as well as user, will be strengthened by a faster energy transition,” states the IEA document, before adding, China's dominance of the world's solar and battery manufacturing industries can be replicated in areas such as fuel cell and electrolyzer technology, if the nation opts for a faster race to net zero.
On the subject of raw materials sourcing and processing, which has so vexed policymakers in Europe and the U.S., the 304-page study adds: “China's vast resources of critical minerals, from which metals required for the manufacturing of those technologies can be extracted, gives it a large competitive advantage over other countries.”
Those are sentiments likely to be less welcome in European capitals than the prospect the IEA holds out of a faster energy transition offering a net gain of 1.3 million high-quality jobs for China – some 900,000 more than is estimated to be on offer from the APS outlook modeled.
Such an approach would be undeniably good for Chinese solar companies, with the ATS path – which would focus on net zero by mid century, rather than the 2060 mark currently envisaged – adding up to 1.4 TW of solar and wind generation capacity in 29 years' time. Even the APS model estimates 200 GW of solar would be added annually from 2030 to 2060 – plus 57 GW per year of wind farms – although that power source would arrive alongside four 1 GW nuclear reactors per annum from last year, to ensure the world's biggest nuclear fleet by 2060.
By 2060, the report states, almost half of Chinese PV will be on buildings with that volume of facade and rooftop solar panels accounting for 2.2 TW of generation capacity. If 60% of that building-based PV is used for self-consumption, the report's authors calculate, some 2-3 TWh of surplus electricity will be available to the grid daily – which will be important, given the projected development of green hydrogen.
If ambition can be raised – with the help of a beefed-up emissions trading scheme (ETS) and accelerated liberalization of the electricity market – the renewables revolution can start even earlier, with around $125 billion invested into solar and wind facilities from 2025-30, securing around 160 GW of generation capacity during that period, compared to the 40 GW per year envisaged in the APS model.
On the green hydrogen front, the IEA notes China has plans to develop more than 2 GW of electrolyzer capacity with the 30 MW facility operating at Ningxia Baofeng Energy Group‘s coal-to-olefins operation in Ningxia set to be expanded to 100 MW this year, in a move which would see it become the world's largest dedicated hydrogen-production electrolyzer.
The relative youth of the nation's natural gas network offers an obvious opportunity to plan for national hydrogen distribution, states the study, although the IEA expects green hydrogen, at a price of $1.30-1.80/kg, to only become competitive with the natural gas-plus-carbon capture ‘blue' version of the gas, and coal-plus carbon capture option, by 2050.
The development of solid state batteries will see cell-level energy density double this decade, states the study, helping China maintain its global leadership of the battery storage industry.
The opportunity for continued Chinese dominance of global supply chains, the emphasis on nuclear and carbon capture and storage roll-out, and the continuing use of coal-fired power generation are likely to cause disquiet among various commentators but the central importance of China's climate change ambitions in keeping the global temperature rise this century below 1.5C is repeatedly emphasized.
Simply maintaining the use of China's existing fossil fuel assets – without any new plants – will consume about a third of the ‘carbon budget' a 1.5C world is estimated to have up to 2060, note the authors of the report.
Returning to the issue of global co-operation in a line from the report which may already appear dated amid fresh diplomatic tensions with the U.S. and Australia, the IEA document notes combating climate change “is a race against time, not against each other.”

The solar cell was built with graphite and carbon black from Beijing Dk Nano Technology Co., Ltd, α-Terpineol from Titan Technology
Co., Ltd, lead iodide (PbI2) and methylammonium halides (CH3NH3I) from Advanced Electronic Technology Co., Ltd, 5-ammonium valeric acid iodide (5-AVAI) and titanium oxide (TiO2) from GreatCell Solar, zirconium dioxide (ZrO2 paste) from WonderSolar Co., Ltd, and γ-butyrolactone (GBL) from Acros Organics. “And waste toner carbon powder used here was got from office of ourself,” the scientists explained. “All materials were used as received without further purification.”

The carbon paste for the electrode was made with 5.6 g of waste toner carbon powder and graphite, 1.06 g ZrO2, and 0.8 g ethyl cellulose dispersed into 15 g α-Terpineol. Four samples were created with a weight content of 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 17 wt% and 23 wt%, respectively.
The variations in the amount of carbon paste used have a different impact on the solar cell performance, as these change considerably the electrode's morphology, charge recombination, hydrophobicity, work function, and conductivity. “As a result, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) reaches as high as 11.78% with 10% weight content of waste toner carbon,” the Chinese group stated, “The best performance is determined by the electrode morphology and hydrophobic characteristics, which in turn affects the injection of perovskite precursors, crystal formation, suppression of charge recombination, and charge extraction and collection.”
The cell also achieved an open-circuit voltage of 0.88 V, a short-circuit current density of 24.64 mA cm, and a fill factor of 54.56%.
The proposed technique is described in the paper Photovoltaic green application of waste toner carbon on fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells, which was recently published in Solar Energy. The scientists claim the novel technology opens up a “new pathway for the green application of waste toner carbon.”

The Brazilian government's A-5 auction on Thursday resulted in the allocation of 860,796 MW of projects involving different renewable sources. Solar accounted for 236.40 MW of the total across 20 projects.
With a discount of 12.63% from the ceiling price of BRL 191.00 ($35)/MWh, solar reached an average sale price of BRL 166.89/MWh. On average, 47% of the electricity will go to so-called “captive” consumers. The other 35 MW of capacity that was not contracted in the auction will be negotiated in the free market under power purchase agreements.
About 27.8 MW of wind capacity was also contracted, in addition to another 27.8 MW from the São Roque hydroelectric plant. Biomass was the source that sold the most energy in the auction. The average prices for the other sources were BRL 160.36/MWh for wind, BRL 271.26/MWh for biomass, and BRL 549.35/MWh for solid waste.
The selected projects must begin commercial operations by 2026.
 
Source: CCEE
The amount of more expensive sources such as biomass was higher than the volume of solar and wind capacity, which is a red flag for the federal government and consumers, said the Brazilian Association of Photovoltaic Solar Energy (Absolar). However, Rodrigo Sauaia, the executive president of the association, said the auction results reinforce the competitiveness of solar PV.
“However, the contracted volume was very low compared to the very high number of projects that participated in the auction,” he said. “This caused high competition among entrepreneurs, producing average prices below the reference of the photovoltaic solar source in Brazil, which demonstrates a high competitive capacity of the source, even in times of macroeconomic turbulence.”
The solar projects contracted in the procurement exercise are located in the northeastern and southeastern parts of Brazil, in the states of Ceará (96.24 MW), Piauí (60 MW) and São Paulo (80.16 MW).
Absolar has urged the federal government to increase the contracting of solar in Brazil.
“The scarcity of water further reinforces the strategic role of solar energy as part of the solution to diversify and strengthen the country's electricity supply, essential for the resumption of national economic growth,” said Anderson Garofalo Concon, Absolar's vice president of centralized generation.

The factory already hosts two “DUO machines” from Midsummer. “Midsummer's manufacturing equipment is by far the best for producing these types of solar cells and our ambition is to increase the number of DUO machines in our factory to the maximum number of eight in 2022,” said Sunflare CEO Philip Gao.
The U.S. company currently makes four different flexible panels at the manufacturing facility. The Flex 60 panel is available in 165 W to 185 W versions, with efficiencies ranging from 13.3% to 15%. The 60-cell frameless panels can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V, with a temperature coefficient of 0.35% per degree Celsius, and a bypass diode per cell. It measures 1,660 mm x 990 mm x 1.7 mm and weighs in at 5 kg. Its open-circuit voltage is 35-4-36.6 V and its short-circuit current is 7.3-7.5 A.
“The 127 mm stainless steel substrate allows for generous curvature,” said Sunflare.
The PowerFit 2 module has a power output of 60 W and a power conversion efficiency of 15.0%. The 20-cell frameless panel measures 3,439 mm x 388 mm x 1.7 mm and weighs 1.6 kg. Its open-circuit voltage is 12.0 V and its short-circuit current is 7.3 A. It can operate with a system voltage of 1,000 V and has the same temperature coefficient as the Flex 60 product.
“With PowerFit there are no roof penetrations needed,” the manufacturer said. “The modules come with a butyl adhesive backing – just peel and stick for a secure, water-tight hold that can withstand gale force wind.”
The Litemount 60 panel has the same electrical specifications and is the same size as the Flex 60 product, but it has a black anodized aluminum frame and is a bit heavier at 7.1 kg. Sunflare has described the module as the only lightweight panel that seamlessly integrates with every existing metal roof attachment system.
The fourth product is a 105 W frameless module with a conversion efficiency of 11.0%. The 40-cell Xplor panel measures 1,202 mm x 828 mm x 1.7 mm and weighs 2.9 kg. Its open-circuit voltage is 21.0 V and its short-circuit current is 7.4 A. It can operate with a system voltage of 1,000 V and has the same temperature coefficient as the other three products. The panel can also be used for mobile applications.
All of the modules are purportedly 75% lighter than conventional crystalline solar panels and 95% thinner. Their output is guaranteed at 90% of the original efficiency for 10 years and at 80% for 25 years.

Now, scientists at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE have worked with equipment supplier M10 Industries AG to demonstrate a new type of shingled layout for modules, and its applicability at industrial scale. The approach, which the two companies have dubbed ‘Matrix Shingle Technology’ (MST), places cell shingles offset from each other, similar to how bricks are laid in a wall. The creators claim this approach allows better occupation of the entire module area, leading to improved efficiency and shading tolerance, and an aesthetically pleasing homogenous appearance – according to Fraunhofer ISE, the matrix shingled technology will produce that perform between 2% and 6% better than a conventionally connected half cut cell module layout.
In work presented at last month’s EU PVSEC conference, the group found that its MST approach also leads to much better tolerance of partial shading, since current can flow around the shaded areas of the module. This could make the modules particularly suitable for building, or even vehicle, integrated solar. “Matrix shingle modules are predestined for integrated applications, especially in building façades,” says Achim Kraft, head of group Interconnection and Encapsulation at Fraunhofer ISE. “Particularly in building integration, maximum area utilization, shading tolerance and appealing aesthetics are important.”
Straight to scale
Having proven the potential of MST modules in various applications, Fraunhofer ISE worked with equipment supplier M10 Industries to demonstrate how the modules could be produced at scale. “The matrix approach has enabled us to implement a completely new machine concept. Our system has a much higher throughput than classic shingle stringers and is in no way inferior to conventional stringers in terms of megawatt output,” explained Phillipp Zahn, CEO of M10 Industries AG.
The prototype, set to be demonstrated at the Intersolar Europe Restart beginning tomorrow in Munich, can process 12,000 cell shingles per hour, and can be integrated into conventional module lines. Fraunhofer says it took only seven months to develop the tool, and that it has a prototype machine in up and running in Freiburg, and available for further testing.

The plan is part of a new €12.9 billion fund that the Irish government has allocated for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) by the end of the decade, as part of the revision of the country's National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2030.
Part of this sum – around €1.3 billion – has been collected from carbon tax receipts and is intended for use in retrofitting 500,000 homes to a building energy rating of B2, and the expected heat pump deployment is expected to play a major role in this transition.
“This investment will support significant numbers of free energy upgrades for low-income households and those at risk from energy poverty over the coming years,” said DECC minister Eamon Ryan. “It will be complemented by the government’s Housing for All [policy], which commits to the retrofitting of 36,500 local authority houses by 2030.”
The government also said it wants to raise the share of renewable electricity in the generation mix up to 80% and to allocate around 15.5 GW of wind and solar capacity through the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). Of this installed power, 5 GW is planned to come from offshore wind, 8 GW from onshore wind and 2.5 GW from utility scale solar.
Recent research from the European Heat Pump Association (EHPA) found that the Irish market is currently largely dominated by air and water source heat pumps, with small market shares left to ground-source and air-to-air and air-source heat pumps. At the end of 2020, around 44,000 heat pumps were operational in the country.

Global PV supply chains have experienced considerable disruption over the past 12 to 18 months, with a series of shocks delaying module shipments and increasing prices. In the latest development in the global marketplace, the U.S. authorities have prevented some modules from being imported into the country, as they are under the suspicion of having been produced, at least in some part, through coercive labor programs in the Xinjiang region of China.
Something very similar could occur in Australia, warns Maxeon Solar Technologies Vice President Chris OBrien. He points to the progress of the Modern Slavery Bill (2018) moving through the legislative process of federal parliament as indicative of action being taken. He argues that the legislation will see solar supply chains come under much more scrutiny.
“What we will see is that there will be a lot more of a focus on it,” says O’Brien.
In the United States, the focus on potential slave labor in manufacturing has moved right to the very start of the solar supply chain – metallurgical-grade polysilicon, the feedstock for PV ingots and cells. There are significant operations in the Xinjiang region, and it is difficult for PV cell and module makers to prove that the silicon in their modules is entirely free from forced labor.
“We go through a process, and have been for some time, of auditing our suppliers, our suppliers’ suppliers, and tracing all the way down to the origin of the raw material,” says O’Brien. “And we don’t have any breaches of our own policies.”
O’Brien reports that this is important for PV project investors and financiers, as they do not want to put their money behind projects that use modules which could potentially be tainted by suspect labor practices.
“We are dealing with financiers in Australia on utility-scale projects and their key priority is sustainability. You can imagine one of the big utilities coming back six or 12 months later and asking, ‘are our panels ok in terms of sustainability of forced labor?’ People are wanting to get in front of it now,” he elaborates.
Earlier this year Maxeon published its first Sustainability Report. “It was good timing having that report come out,” says O’Brien.
Maxeon was spun off from SunPower a little over a year ago. The company has its headquarters in Singapore and is making the APAC region a strategic priority. It supplies its modules through the former company’s manufacturing facilities in Southeast Asia, along with the JV production facility for its shingled P-Series modules in China.
“One of the key messages is the growth of APAC,” says O’Brien. “Bloomberg are talking APAC doing 34 GW [of PV] this year and 77 GW in 2030. If 77 GW comes to pass over the next 10 years, it will be a massive growth of the importance of APAC in the global PV market. And that’s APAC without China I’m talking about.”

A pair of newly released documents reveal how the work of renewable energy developers has brought about major improvements to the accessibility and quality of publicly available power grid data. The documents also show that renewable project development has been bankrolling grid upgrades for years.
First, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) released Key Decisions for Hosting Capacity Analysis. The document is described as a tool for regulatory staff and stakeholders to identify the critical decisions that go into developing a public facing, state level, power grid Hosting Capacity Analysis (HCA) map set.
And while the analysis was released as a tool for policy makers to learn how HCA maps are deployed, it also painted a picture of the data collection work needed to compile the vast, detailed information describing the “largest machines in the world.” The broad volume of information needed by solar developers also drove the development of these tools.

IREC proposed three main options for using the HCA map tool:
Solar developers already use these hosting capacity maps to mitigate siting challenges. If a local substation or set of power lines appear to be overloaded, developers are more likely to avoid the location.

The above hosting capacity map of solar-heavy New Bedford, Massachusetts, shows that many power lines in the region are already at maximum capacity (burgundy colored lines). By itself, this information does not fully signal whether or not solar can be installed.
The type of information delivered in these maps varies by state, with IREC’s report presenting a commonly shared set of information. The substation information below shows some of what might be found in the maps.
Of course, the electric utilities have had this information all along, they simply weren’t collecting or sharing it in an organized manner. Access to the information required the sort of byzantine search process that only a monopoly industry with little outside pressure can get away with.

Pressure points
So why is this information being made available now? Well, mostly because the distributed solar industry spent years pressuring the electric utility companies with their projects. Electric utilities hold billions of dollars in publicly funded assets, and yet were unable to provide clear records.
Developers had to challenge utilities so that their projects could exist. Interconneting solar to the grid was and still is an aggressively opaque process.
The other emerging reality is that on the large scale, solar and wind power are upgrading the transmission power grids as part of their required installations.
The second report, from the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), Just and Reasonable? Transmission Upgrades Charged to Interconnecting Generators Are Delivering System-Wide Benefits, showed that utility-scale upgrades by wind and solar power in the Midwest are bringing greater benefit to all electricity generators. It also showed that utilities have frequently violated standard cost sharing rules.
Per ACORE’s report, interconnection rules in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region stipulate that 90% of the cost of significant upgrades – 345 kilovolt powerlines and larger – are to be paid for by the newly interconnecting generators. Others already connected to the grid pay 10% of those upgrade fees. In the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) managed region, newly interconnecting generation must pay all of the upgrade costs.
It might, intuitively, seem as if newly connected generation should foot the bill for its own, necessary grid upgrades. However, evidence shows that these upgrade costs are not equitable.
The first point is that practically all new generation across the nation now comes from solar and wind (including the MISO and SPP power grid regions). New solar and wind developments are currently shouldering nearly all the costs of upgrades across the power grid.
The second point is that the massive benefits these grid upgrades provide – many tens of millions of dollars annually – are passed on to existing generators, and society in general.
In the chart below, ACORE research lists 12 power grid upgrades driven by renewable energy, along with the costs for and benefits of those upgrades. Across all the projects, roughly $1 billion in benefits (APC Savings) flowed not to renewable projects, but to the whole of the power grid.

If we’re honest about our current power grid development reality, we will accept that it is renewables that have clearly been footing the bill for upgrades to the power grid. Cost-benefit accounting has revealed inequities that hamper technological progress, potentially affecting future grid security.
As soon as we admit these faults exist, utilities and developers can start to compromise on more equitable process development.
