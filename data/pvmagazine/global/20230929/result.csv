Federal guidelines recommend solar PV installations be sited a minimum distance 100 meters from residential houses, but Choe told pv magazine many local governments trying to expand solar have “resorted to exceptional clauses to bypass the separation distance regulations,” he said.
“But these measures can be a temporary fix at best and cannot solve the fundamental issue,” he added.
South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) introduced recommendations for sited solar requirements in 2017. A year following the announcement, 68 local governments introduced their own guidelines. Choe said the federal guidelines did not “reflect the challenges” facing local governments, which respond to residents’ queries and complaints.
Choe’s fresh criticism comes as SFOC, in collaboration with researchers from the University of Maryland, this week published a research brief stating Korea’s current Electricity Basic Plan and Carbon Neutrality Plan were not congruous with the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target. The target sets out to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030.
The report blamed South Korean policy misalignments and delayed coal-to-renewable energy transitions for not reaching the mark.
“As of August 2023, there are 30 coal-fired power plants (85 units, a total of 40.2 GW) in operation, and two new units (2.1 GW) under construction in Samcheok City,” the report stated. “Following the announced retirements and a 30-year lifetime for the remaining plants, 51 units (28.7 GW) remain operating by 2035, and a complete coal phaseout does not occur until 2050. Therefore, accelerated coal retirement is needed to close the gap.”
The paper claimed that “rapid decarbonization of the power sector” was key to achieving the 1.5 C low-overshoot pathway.
“Our analysis suggests that by 2030, 45% of total electricity generation that is provided by renewable sources of energy, mostly solar and wind generation, can exceed both the prior target and the current 10th Electricity Basic Plan. To achieve this level of generation, over 100 GW of renewable capacity needs to be installed by 2030, which requires adding 10–12 GW new capacity per year between today and 2030,” the report reads.
Choe said the government introduced renewable portfolio standards (RPS) in 2012 to accelerate the procurement of renewable energy, including solar PV. “Yet, the government has lowered the RPS ratio earlier this year,” he said. “It also downgraded the 2030 national target for renewable energy generation from 30.20% to 21.6%, which subsequently lowered this year’s goal for additional procurement for solar energy from 3 GW to 2.5 GW.”
The five-year Korean feed-in tariff (FiT) scheme ended this year without an alternative policy, Choe added.
Jinsun Lee, SFOC’s head of power market and grid, told pv magazine that South Korea could get back on track if the coal-to-renewable transition was expedited “as quickly as possible”. “The expansion of solar is important for the same reasons that renewable energy deployment is critical,” she said. “It will help the country utilize the full potential of its resources while reducing emissions and mitigating the climate crisis.”

They suggest large-scale storage in proven salt caverns, primarily in Poland, Germany, and the United Kingdom, with less potential in southern Europe. Underground storage of compressed hydrogen in lined rock caverns and depleted hydrocarbon fields is being explored, with contamination concerns requiring further study. Smaller-scale storage options like above-ground tanks, liquid hydrogen, and ammonia may also be viable depending on specific situations.
US and Singaporean researchers have introduced a low-cost aluminum formate (ALF) capable of storing significant hydrogen quantities at non-cryogenic temperatures (>120 K) and low pressures. ALF, with a binding energy of 8.6 kJ/mol, requires cooling to approximately -100 C for maximum hydrogen storage. This molecular sponge, composed of inexpensive aluminum and organic compounds, shows promise for mass-market applications, potentially serving as fuel storage for industrial backup power. ALF is priced at $2 /kg, one-fifth of the community goal for nickel-based MOF production costs, making it an attractive option for safe hydrogen storage systems supporting fuel cells
Nikola has introduced its hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle at its manufacturing site in Coolidge, Arizona. The American heavy-duty vehicle manufacturer reported 223 non-binding orders from 23 customers and highlighted the truck's impressive attributes: a 500-mile range and a quick 20-minute fueling time.
New York State Governor Kathy Hochul has unveiled a $100 million funding initiative for zero-emission school buses statewide. This initiative marks the first round of funding under the $4.2 billion Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act of 2022. Starting on Nov. 29, manufacturers and dealers of zero-emission battery electric (BEV) or hydrogen fuel cell electric buses can apply to receive funding.
Salzgitter has chosen Andritz to construct a 100 MW electrolysis plant at its Salzgitter Flachstahl site on an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) basis. The plant will incorporate pressurized alkaline electrolyzer technology from HydrogenPro. Expected to commence operation in 2026, this facility will produce approximately 9,000 tons of green hydrogen annually, which will be utilized in the production of green steel, as stated by the German steel manufacturer.
The International Energy Agency says that rapid progress has been observed in commercial-scale demonstrations of solid oxide hydrogen electrolyzers, with two large demonstrators commencing operations in 2023. However, according to the latest update to its Roadmap: A Global Pathway to Keep the 1.5 C Goal in Reach, electrolyzers are still falling behind. This assessment holds true even when considering preliminary manufacturing projects, indicating a gap in achieving the targets for 2030 in a Net Zero Scenario.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says that the Just Transition Fund is investing €1.6 billion in Czechia to establish new hydrogen valleys in regions currently dependent on coal. She emphasizes that their investments span the entire clean hydrogen value chain, covering production, storage, transport, and industrial applications. Additionally, von der Leyen highlights that Czech Tatra Trucks will unveil the first hydrogen-powered heavy-duty vehicle in November.
The European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will go into effect during its transitional phase on Oct. 1. During this stage, CBAM will exclusively cover imports of cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity, and hydrogen, according to the European Commission. This phase aims to enable EU institutions to gather data on embedded emissions and improve the methodology for the definitive application period, commencing in 2026.

She discussed the commission's efforts to advancing the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, which is currently undergoing consultation. Simson noted that this initiative, along with a series of measures implemented since the start of the Ukraine war, aims to reduce reliance on Russian gas.
“Policy developments will be critical to heat pump implementation and more accessible financing will be crucial,” she said. “We want the heat pump industry to stay in Europe.”
EHPA President Martin Forsen noted the EU's efforts to promote heat pump adoption. He pointed to the swift launch of REPowerEU shortly after the start of Russia-Ukraine hostilities, but expressed concern about the potential barriers to heat pump deployment in the United Kingdom and Germany. He said that rumors of scaling back and internal opposition within these governments are threatening their plans.
“We need brave decisions,” he said, noting that levies and taxes on electricity are currently much higher than those imposed on gas. “We need to have decent European energy price ratios for gas and electricity.”
The event has also shown that heat pump companies and utilities are now pursuing several business models to overcome one of the sector's biggest challenges – the need for high upfront investment.
Oliver Franz, VP European Associations at E.ON SE, noted the significance of capex. He said that utilities are grappling with the challenge of persuading customers to embrace a technology that remains unfamiliar to many homeowners and commercial businesses.
“And we don't have to forget there is a tradeoff between costs and comfort,” said Sonja Soar, COO and co-founder of smart energy company Kapacity.io. “And we don't have to forget that, sometimes, the level of comfort depends more on the dwelling.”
She emphasized the importance of savings and suggested that homeowners should be informed about the level of comfort they are willing to sacrifice to achieve greater savings.
“Customers all scared by capex,” said Andy Bradley, partner at energy consultant LCP Delta. “Providing heat pumps on a service-as-a-service basis may currently be a good solution to have more accessible financing.”
Aimee Clark, head of commercial for Octopus Energy Group, emphasized the importance of subsidies in this market phase. She said that the service-as-a-service model could be a good solution to partially compensate for the lack of high incentive levels.
During a panel discussion on financing, Csaba de Csiky, chairman and managing partner at EnerSave Capital, underscored the need for the heat pump industry to develop large project pipelines.
“Money is not the issue,” he said. “But investors are looking for big pipelines.”
For example, he mentioned that investors would readily finance real estate developers seeking to renovate large apartment buildings with decarbonized solutions.
“Think big, dream big,” he stated and also noted the difficulty of changing patterns in approaching heat pump technologies. “Some people simply can't get over boilers,” he concluded.
The event also focused on the need for innovation, research, and standardized industry solutions.

Dark clouds hang over the European solar market, and SolarPower Europe has even spoken of a “perfect storm.”
Module prices have plunged by nearly 30% since January, with utility-scale PV offers hitting €0.11/W ($0.12/W). The solar industry's cyclical nature is resurfacing when the EU Commission and German government plan to rebuild their PV supply chains.
A debate has ignited among industry participants on the need for measures to restrict Chinese module imports, sparking heated debate on social media. Saxony-Anhalt Energy Minister Armin Willingmann, leading Germany's energy ministers' conference, has addressed the problem. They have cited unfair competition and have attributed the “module glut” to a US import ban over forced labor allegations in Xinjiang, China. The belief is that unsellable US stock is flooding European warehouses, driving down prices, and exacerbated by Chinese “dumping.” Potential measures, yet undefined, could include import duties or bans in response to dumping and forced labor concerns.
Cost concerns
However, analysts find that explaining the module price drop solely as Chinese dumping is overly simplistic. Some gauge module supply by comparing export data from major Chinese ports with European installation volumes, despite the lack of official export data from China.
These estimates are subject to short-term fluctuations and will become more accurate with time, acknowledging some inaccuracy in module inventory data. However, on a European scale, this discrepancy amounts to just a few gigawatts. For context, the German Federal Ministry of Economics anticipates a European Union photovoltaics market of 70 GW to 100 GW by 2023.
In June, analysts at Rystad Energy first observed module accumulation at the Rotterdam port, initially projecting a year-end module inventory of 100 GW. However, Marius Mordal Bakke, an analyst at Rystad, revised his year-end module inventory forecast in an interview with pv magazine. He noted that market adjustments led to significant order reductions. Examining module export data from China to Europe, he observed inventory levels stagnating at around 40 GW, suggesting that manufacturers respond to demand signals from wholesalers and project developers.
The 40 GW accumulation is the result of market dynamics in Europe. The Ukraine conflict and energy crisis drove many homeowners to invest in photovoltaics, heat pumps, and electric vehicles in 2022. Concurrently, ongoing pandemic disruptions in Chinese manufacturing capacities hindered production ramp-up. Wholesalers frequently struggled with deliveries, often leaving new customers underserved. Orders were declined, and existing customers were categorized based on priority, leading to a subsequent market downturn.
“Retailers across Europe saw their inventory running low and ordered massively to be able to deliver to their customers immediately,” said Edurne Zoco, an analyst at S&P Global. At that time, the wholesalers' sales representatives were fighting for every container from China, as well-known wholesalers unanimously reported to pv magazine.
As a result, module manufacturers' sales teams repeatedly increased their demand forecasts, prompting manufacturers to expand production capacities. The market shifted from being a “distribution market,” where scarce goods were rationed, to a “buyers' market,” where price became the primary concern, and demand could be met.
Taking lessons from 2022, wholesalers, mindful of not disappointing customers again, stocked their warehouses generously. Any excess that couldn't fit in the warehouse remained at the port. During the summer, analysts from Rystad, BNEF, and S&P Global consistently observed a gap between module imports and installations, ranging from 40 GW to 60 GW.
The European market also underwent changes, with energy prices gradually returning to normal levels.
“Rooftop market growth in Europe in 2022 was significant due to the energy crisis and high electricity prices, but this sense of urgency for installations in the residential and commercial sectors has waned as electricity prices came back from record prices,” says Zoco.
Verivox reported that on Jan. 1, the average cost of a kilowatt-hour for new customers in Germany was about €0.44 (§0.47). Since then, prices have consistently fallen, with new customers now paying an average of €0.29/kWh. This trend has a clear impact: as electricity prices decline, the incentive to invest in photovoltaics diminishes.
Additionally, rising interest rates have made financing considerably more expensive. Negative publicity surrounding the Building Energy Act has further discouraged potential solar installations, especially in conjunction with heat pumps.
End of the party
Although demand in the rooftop segment remained relatively strong, it did not meet the expectations of manufacturers and many wholesalers during the first quarter, resulting in demand falling significantly short of expectations. An oversupply of modules led to price declines, posing a serious challenge for wholesalers who had purchased modules at higher prices than they could currently sell them for.
Wholesalers who obtained 500 W modules at €0.25/W are now struggling to sell them for only €0.15/W, resulting in substantial capital losses on inventory. This situation has led to some retailers facing financial difficulties, raising the risk of insolvency. To cope with the oversupply, both Chinese module manufacturers and European wholesalers are working to offload their inventory, even if it means selling below value, prioritizing cash flow over profit.
The World Trade Organization's definition of dumping includes not only prices below production costs but also whether manufacturers charge similar prices in export markets as in their home market. Inquiries in China revealed offers for new p-type modules ranging from €0.156/W to €0.164/W, with slightly higher average prices for new n-type modules, ranging from €0.166/W to €0.176/W. The minimum value of €0.11/W likely represents discounted pricing for older PERC modules.
“We have confirmation of distress sales to reduce inventory as well as redirection of some volumes to other parts of the world,” Zoco said.
According to some analysts, the problem of particularly large module stocks is a global one. Zoco, for example, names Brazil as the destination for module redirections.
The widespread transition to TOPCon technology is contributing to the decline in prices for PERC modules. PERC manufacturers are required to switch to TOPCon technology promptly, resulting in the rapid depletion of PERC cell stocks, which are being processed into modules, suspected by both wholesalers and analysts, albeit cautiously. While the process appears plausible, it is challenging to definitively prove.
The swift adoption of TOPCon and Heterojunction technologies is naturally driving down prices for PERC modules. Some manufacturers are enticed by the prospect of “fire sales,” prioritizing the release of capital tied up in modules. Delaying sales could lead to higher losses, although some manufacturers urgently need the funds to remain financially stable.
Chinese manufacturers are also facing a challenging situation, incurring losses due to the ongoing price war. Jenny Chase, an analyst at BNEF, foresees the possibility of bankruptcies among Chinese manufacturers, a recurring occurrence in the cyclical solar industry. The decisive factor in this regard will be internal Chinese demand for modules in 2024 and 2025.
“It is too early to know whether this will have an impact on consolidation at the manufacturer level,” said Zoco.
Wright's Law?
The debate centers on whether prices fall below production costs. Analysts note that most mainstream modules are sold for €0.14/W to €0.16/W in projects exceeding 10 MW. The cost learning curve evaluates industry development, traditionally yielding a 20% cost reduction with production capacity doubling since 1976 when Wattpeak cost $100, maintaining a favorable trend with an outlier in 2008.
As of 2020, global installed capacity reached 774 GW, with mainstream module prices at €0.21/W according to the pvXchange index. With cumulative installed capacity in 2023 at 1,500 GW, post-learning curve costs could be around €0.168/W. While prices may vary due to supply and demand, this suggests that the price decline doesn't seem fundamentally implausible, requiring direct explanations of subsidies or dumping.
Analysts and wholesalers anticipate it may take until the first quarter of the next year to normalize inventory levels. The ongoing debate regarding measures to restrict Chinese module imports mirrors the situation during the 2013-2018 “tariff period.” Many individuals we interviewed, including wholesalers, project developers, and analysts, express doubts about tariffs effectively stimulating European production. Higher photovoltaic product costs could lead to decreased demand, potentially necessitating additional public funding.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/29/wind-speed-increases-could-cause-pv-yield-losses/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,SPAIN,WESTERN EUROPE",LIOR KAHANA,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2023",Wind speed increases could cause PV yield losses,"New research from Spain’s University of Alcala reveals that higher wind speeds can result in mismatch and power yield losses in solar power plants. In “Energy losses in photovoltaic generators due to wind patterns,” recently published in Communications Engineering, the researchers challenge the conventional belief that increased wind speed benefits ground-mounted PV plants by enhancing solar module cooling.
“In these previous cases, the interface module/air flux is small to appreciate a full airflow development in natural conditions,” the scientists said. “In big PV generators exposed to wind patterns, the module temperature depends on its position inside them, as the air flux affects how the module exchanges heat with it. This is the reason why the wind speed increase did not necessarily bring the best PV performance.”
The researchers conducted real-world measurements on a PV system situated at the Technical University of Madrid, consisting of 21 south-oriented modules, each with a 245 W output. They used a thermographic camera to measure transient temperatures resulting from slight wind fluctuations in a single cell. Additionally, temperature and voltage were recorded at various points on the PV system using resistance temperature detectors.
Their findings indicate that when the system faces headwinds, it experiences higher mismatch losses compared to winds coming from the rear. Specifically, daily energy loss with headwinds was 0.28%, while tailwinds reduced energy production by 0.21%. Under the same conditions but with lower wind speeds, headwinds resulted in a 0.25% mismatch loss, while tailwinds caused a 0.17% loss. On days with very low or no wind, the observed loss was 0.13%.
“In other words, a decrease of the energy losses with the wind speed decrease,” the group said. “This apparent counter-intuitive argument follows the fluid mechanics theory, as the wind interaction with the PV generator induces air flux variations that modify the heat transfer from the modules to the air. The thermal behavior that leads to these losses is intrinsically linked with the airflow properties.”
The researchers also found that monthly mismatch losses follow the same patterns as daily losses.
“As the typical lifespan of a PV power plant may last some decades, this must represent an important uncertainty source to ensure the reliability of the PV plants,” they explained. “This suggests that the hitherto depreciated local wind patterns for energy estimations must be taken into account for a proper energy estimation during their lifespan.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/29/construction-begins-on-massive-merchant-wind-solar-hybrid-plant-in-bulgaria/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,BULGARIA",ANGELA SKUJINS,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2023","Construction begins on massive, merchant wind-solar hybrid plant in Bulgaria","Konstantin Nenov, director of Bulgaria-based investment firm Renalfa AD, told pv magazine that construction has started on Bulgaria’s first hybrid wind-solar energy project.
Called Tenevo Solar, the project is planned to have a solar capacity of 237.58 MW, a wind capacity of 237 MW and a storage capacity of 250 MW-500 MWh.
The location of the 200 ha plant in Bulgaria’s east, Tenevo in the Yambol region, represents a shift away from fossil fuels, he said.
“The project is located in Tenevo, which is close to one of the biggest coal mining areas in the country,” Nenov said, referring to Bulgaria’s largest lignite mine, Marista East, which is located 191 km south of the project. “It's a very good example of transition.”
The park’s battery operations should start by 2026 latest. The developer will use n-type solar modules and bifacial trackers for the project.
Managed by Renalfa AD’s subsidiary group, Solarpro, the project is a joint investment between Denmark-headquartered Eurowind Energy, a renewable energy project company, and Austria-headquartered Renalfa IPP, an independent power producer. Both companies are participating in a joint venture titled EURA UPP.
Although Nenov remained tight-lipped around a power purchase agreement (PPA), he said, “We are currently considering a merchant” and the consortium was “prohibited” from entering into PPAs at this point.
The consortium selected Tenevo as the location for the plant as received optimal amounts of solar irradiation and wind, Nenov said.
Speaking more broadly about Bulgaria, he said despite there not being any current subsidies for solar, regulations were “developing” and the country was “favorable” to renewable projects. Large-scale solar PV arrays in development include the 227 MW solar project in Silistra, northeastern Bulgaria, managed by Rezolv Energy, and the 124 MW solar Verila solar project on Verila Mountain in western Bulgaria, managed by Sunotec.
In 2022 Bulgaria's Electricity System Operator (ESO) announced the country was in “urgent” need of grid expansion to support the country's burgeoning electricity transmission system. Nenov said while there was still work to be done for grid access and market liberalization, “We see good signs of improvement, and that's why a lot of investors are looking current now to Bulgarian markets.”
In 2021 the Bulgarian government committed to phasing out coal by 2038, and in May 2023 launched a scheme aimed at ramping up installations of solar water heating systems, rooftop PV arrays and batteries.
Bulgaria recorded 1948 MW solar PV installed capacity at the end of 2022, according to recent statistics published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Dutch companies We Drive Solar and MyWheels have said that the project will establish Utrecht as the world's first city to provide bidirectional energy services using electric vehicles.
The companies expect to connect 300 electric shared cars in the city to bidirectional charging stations by the end of this year. These vehicles will be able to charge from the stations and also discharge energy, in order to serve as a neighborhood energy storage facility.
“The available solar and wind energy is used to charge the shared cars and can be fed back at times when there is a higher demand for sustainable electricity,” the two companies said in a statement. “Shared cars as neighborhood batteries on wheels can play an important role in countering grid congestion and thereby accelerating the energy transition.”
The station will features 25 Ioniq 5, a V2G technology developed by South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor. V2G technology is used to feed the energy stored in EV batteries back into national grids, which can help to stabilize power supplies during high-demand periods. However, in order for this technology to have a sufficient impact on grid operations, large-scale deployment is necessary.

Some states could lose up to 17% of their daily solar energy production, according to data collected by Solcast, a DNV company, via the Solcast API. The path of the eclipse tracks across the southwestern United States, from Oregon to Texas, before continuing through Mexico, Central America and ending in Brazil, though impacts will be seen across all of the contiguous US and the top of South America.
This eclipse is an annular eclipse, meaning that the moon will not appear big enough to completely block the sun, as it does in a total eclipse. This means irradiance will not drop to 0%, and the sky will not darken completely. As the ‘eye’ of the eclipse passes over an area, the total clearsky irradiance will drop to 9.5% of normal clearsky levels. The total duration of the eclipse effect will be 3 hours in some locations, though the peak will only last for seconds.
This image shows the total loss in clearsky irradiance across the day, where blue represents the areas that will see the greatest losses on October 14th.

At the time of writing, the eclipse is 14 days away, which is too far for accurate cloud predictions. However, it is possible to calculate the maximum irradiance losses, i.e. the impact in the absence of clouds.
As can be seen in this image the path of the eclipse peak impact will hit Oregon first, at 0920 local time, before passing over Northern California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and reaching Texas at 1150 local time. Texas will be hit hardest by the eclipse. The event occurs in the middle of the day when solar energy production is at its peak. As a result, some areas in Texas will experience losses of up to
17% in solar energy production.
The eclipse could significantly impact power grids like CAISO and ERCOT in the U.S. According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the most affected states had 40.756 GW of operational large-scale solar assets as of August 2023. This includes 13.046 GW in Texas, and represents a significant proportion of the 80.368 GW total nameplate capacity of large scale Solar PV in the US.

The total difference can be seen in the above comparison, contrasting total daily irradiance with and without the effects of the eclipse. The largest net impacts are over Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, Central America and Columbia. Whilst Texas will suffer losses up to 17%, the peak loss will reach 20% in Central America.
In South America, the eclipse will make its way in the afternoon and evening. It will track over the Yucatan Peninsula and Central America before reaching Colombia and finally ending in western Brazil at 1620 local time. As the eclipse will pass at or near the middle of the day, when irradiance peaks, losses will be greatest from Texas to Columbia, and proportional daily losses will be lower in Oregon at the start of their day, and Brazil at the end of theirs.
Solcast will continue to track the impacts of the eclipse, including calculating solar impacts once accurate cloud forecasting is possible.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/29/while-solar-is-thriving-european-manufacturers-are-concerned-they-wont-be-able-to-survive-without-protective-measures/,"EVENTS,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,EUROPE",,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2023","While solar is thriving, European manufacturers are concerned they won’t be able to survive without protective measures","At the 40th edition of the EU PVSEC conference, which took place in Lisbon last week, the mood was upbeat within the PV community. And why shouldn’t it be? As Nancy Haegel from NREL pointed out in her closing presentation, 2022 marked the first time in history that, on a global scale, solar power accounted for more than 50% of the net expansion of electricity capacity. In terms of global electricity generation, solar still only contributed 4% last year while fossil fuels stood for more than 66%. By 2035 wind and solar together could account for roughly 50% of the global electricity generation, if all countries finally realize the enormous social, environmental and economic gains that a rapid transition to renewables would entail.
Which brings us to the hottest topic discussed on the exhibition floor and during the coffee breaks in between the presentations: which countries outside of China will benefit from the massive growth in demand for photovoltaic hardware?
Manufacturing support
Both India and the US have already implemented ambitious support schemes to ensure that there will be a renaissance of solar manufacturing in their respective countries. First successes from these policies can already be observed this year, with local champions like Tata, Reliance and First Solar significantly increasing their domestic production capacities.
Europe has also formulated the ambitious goal that it wants to re-establish the entire crystalline photovoltaic value chain on its continent, with the aim that roughly 40% of the European PV demand can be supplied by domestic manufacturers going forward.
Yet until now the corresponding supportive measures have not been put into place to match these ambitions. This is why Europe thus far has had to settle for the more symbolic victories in this respect: this year’s Becquerel Prize was awarded to Gunter Erfurt, the CEO of Meyer Burger for his engagement in re-establishing advanced manufacturing of silicon solar cells and modules in Europe. Erfurt was bestowed the award at the opening ceremony of EU PVSEC.
Meyer Burger manufactures heterojunction solar cells and modules built on their own equipment in factories in Germany. Driven by the lure of a generous support mechanism available in the US, namely the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Meyer Burger has halted all of its European capacity expansion plans and now fully concentrates on establishing a 2 GW cell and module factory in the US instead.
In the run up to EU PVSEC in Lisbon, prices for crystalline PV modules have seen a pronounced drop in key markets, fueling the fear that the European PV industry, which was just beginning to re-establish itself might get crushed as a collateral victim of the infight between the leading Chinese PV manufacturers. The latter have aggressively expanded their production capacities over the past 18 months which has resulted in an increasingly pronounced oversupply situation. The extent of module oversupply became truly apparent in May of this year.
Module prices
On average module prices have declined by more than €0.06/Wp in just three months, with the effect that a number of European manufacturers had to scale back their production as it became increasingly difficult to bridge the rising price gap between modules manufactured in China and those assembled in Europe.
Both Solar Power Europe as well as the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) have turned to the European Commission asking for immediate relief actions in order to avoid another wave of bankruptcies, which they fear for their members, should prices continue to remain at levels between €0.15/Wp and €0.17/Wp – as have been observed in the market lately.
The biggest threat the current price deterioration causes is the consequence that it will be virtually impossible to attract any equity funding for the numerous hopeful European plans to re-establish the photovoltaic value chain. If the impression persists that the photovoltaic industry, namely the leading Chinese manufacturers, are again willing to sacrifice margins over market share and expand their capacities at a faster rate than is met by the rising demand.
This would equate to a fatal blow to all European dreams to re-establish the photovoltaic industry domestically. Every day of the week in Lisbon there were panel discussions and how this worst case scenario could still be avoided. One fraction of the industry voiced the conviction that without protective measures that would directly or indirectly reserve a certain market volume for European manufacturers they would stand no chance to survive. By contrast a second fraction suggested that convincing the leading Chinese manufacturers to establish joint venture PV production facilities in Europe could avoid trade disputes with China and ensure that the benefits of the incredible growth and success story of photovoltaics is more evenly spread around the world.
When it comes to its own ecosystem, the EU PVSEC event was able to demonstrate that it is possible to have an even split between different stakeholder groups even if they do not have equal starting conditions. As an example, both of the poster awards as well as the awards for the oral presentations by students – the so called student awards – were evenly split between the genders, despite female authors accounting for less than a quarter of the abstract submissions.
The strength of attendance at EU PVSEC 2023 was also encouraging. More than 1850 scientists and researchers from more than 60 countries had gathered in Lisbon. There were more than 1050 oral and visual presentations, discussing the latest findings in cell technology, module reliability and renewable policies around the globe.
In 2024 EU PVSEC will be held in Vienna, Austria from September 23 through 27.

TotalEnergies has finalized the acquisition of Ombrea, a French greentech company that specializes in agrivoltaics, but it has not disclosed the financial terms of the deal.
Ombrea – founded in October 2016 in Aix-en-Provence – designs and sells mobile PV shade structures that create a favorable microclimate for plant development and crop protection in agrivoltaic projects.
The startup, which has about 10 operational sites and is researching around 50 crop varieties, previously collaborated with TotalEnergies on an 85.6 kW pilot project in the Aude department of France.
It also established a partnership with Spanish energy supplier Iberdrola to develop large agrivoltaic projects in France, each with a minimum installed power of 10 MW, covering approximately 16 hectares.
This acquisition further strengthens the partnership initiated between Ombrea and TotalEnergies in 2019. For Ombrea, it supports its expansion plans in a highly competitive market, while TotalEnergies stands to benefit from Ombrea's expertise in accelerating the development of its 1.5 GW portfolio of agrivoltaic projects.
TotalEnergies will now offer Ombrea's solutions to the global agricultural sector under the Ombrea brand. Additionally, TotalEnergies intends to establish a dedicated agrivoltaics center at the Ombrea site in Aix-en-Provence.

The high cost of producing solar cells based on compounds of III-V element materials, named according to the groups of the periodic table that they belong to, has confined these devices to niche applications, such as drones and satellites, where low weight and high efficiency are more pressing concerns than the cost of energy produced.
“For the first time, the successful application of mask and plate metallization on such devices is demonstrated,” the researchers stated. “Considering cost and scaling potential, mask and plate has the potential to transform the processing of any III–V-based photovoltaic device.”
For mask and plate front metallization, the group used metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE), which is a chemical vapor deposition technique used to produce single- or polycrystalline thin films, and also implemented a new two-step printing scheme that reportedly allows for the realization of extremely narrow mask openings.
“Using such narrow mask openings, plated contact fingers were realized,” the academics said, noting that the metallized area of the sample cell did not exceed the parts confined by the mask. “It demonstrates that fingers with a shading width of (10.5 ± 0.8) µm can be realized using mask and plate processing.”
They also fine-tuned drop spacing at the fingers’ mask openings, where they meet busbars, in order to avoid resistive losses. “This ensures great homogeneity in width of the final fingers and, thus, supports the light-generated current flow out of the cell,” they explained.
They then formed the contact fingers by nickel electroplating into the mask openings and said the plated fingers stood out by great homogeneity and sharpness at the finger edges. “The fact that the finger edges do not show bleeding-like structures underlines the high quality of this metallization,” they emphasized.
The champion solar cell built with the proposed architecture achieved a power conversion efficiency of 31.6%. “This clearly demonstrates the great potential of this metallization approach for III–V//Si solar cells,” the scientists concluded.
Their approach was presented in the paper “Mask and plate: a scalable front metallization with low-cost potential for III–V-based tandem solar cells enabling 31.6 % conversion efficiency,” published in scientific reports.

Germany-based RTC Power has commissioned a “Giga-Fab” hybrid inverter factory in Augsburg, southern Germany. The facility features two new production lines for its DC 8 and DC 10 inverter models.
The company said it will produce around 5,000 hybrid inverters per month in the future. With the new lines, its annual production capacity has reached 600 MW. The expansion has created more than 100 jobs at the Augsburg location.
RCT Power views the opening as a commitment to Germany, developing battery systems and inverters offered as complete packages. It has achieved success with its systems, winning multiple tests in electricity storage inspections by the Berlin University of Applied Sciences (HTW). Such tests determine the actual performance of solar power systems with battery storage in homes during regular use. In addition, RCT Power said demand for its storage systems is steadily rising.
“The new production lines are the first step on our expansion course. In 2024, we intend to complete two more lines with a total capacity of over 1.2 GW. Then over 10,000 battery inverters can roll off the production line every month,” says Eric Rüland, managing director of sales for RCT Power. “Electricity storage plays a central role in the energy transition and the achievement of climate goals. The fact that this technology is now increasingly being produced in Germany is a very important signal.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/29/irish-solar-energy-association-raises-concerns-over-failure-rates-in-renewables-auctions/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,IRELAND",ANGELA SKUJINS,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2023",Irish Solar Energy Association raises concerns over failure rates in renewables auctions,"The CEO of the Irish Solar Energy Association, Conall Bolger, told pv magazine that while the latest round of tenders for the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) was “good” – as a majority of solar PV utility-scale projects were deemed provisionally successful – he remained highly cautious about the success rate of the procurement exercise, which allocated 497 MW of PV capacity.
ISEA had been collecting figures from the first RESS round, finalized in August 2020, which revealed a “high rate” of project attrition, he said.
“For RESS 1, the last estimate we saw was something in the order of 450-ish MW which was going to reach the finish line. To put that in context, 796 MW was awarded and that's just from a solar perspective,” he said, referring to the first round of the auction scheme. “We're seeing a slightly concerning rate of drop off in terms of projects being able to get through the process.”
Bolger said ISEA will have the finalized data from the second round, launched May 2022, by mid-next week, but what the organization knows already is that 1,534 MW was awarded to solar PV projects in RESS 2 with a delivery deadline of 2025. There have not been enough project notices from this second round, leading ISEA to believe many were not connected, he said.
“What one would be expecting to be seeing by now is a rush of announcements around financial closes achieved, construction entered and so forth,” Bolger explained. “We're seeing some but we're probably not seeing the volume that would line up with achieving those timelines.”
The Irish government and network regulator EirGrid this week published the names of 23 solar PV projects, representing 497 MW, deemed provisionally successful in the latest RESS 3 scheme. Selected developers will be awarded a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA). In a press release, Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Eamon Ryan said this round targeted “mature, shovel-ready projects” that already have planning permissions and grid connection offers.
Asked if the projects from the first round were not “mature” enough to connect to the grid, Bolger responded: “In the first auction there were probably lessons learned for everybody… But that's still a significant drop-off rate.” Issues preventing projects from reaching completion include “red tape”, grid issues and the “misalignment” of dates, Bolger said, adding that the association had attempted to request flexibility from the government, “[but] we haven't been getting it thus far.”
“Sometimes there is a process of misalignment in the bureaucracy, ‘permitting’ – to use of the European terminology – which is causing a problem to projects that have planning, they have grids, but then they have to reconsent to the grid route,” he said.
The grid in particular is causing major headaches, Bolger said, with some projects’ completion dates being delayed 6—12 months. “It’s very challenging,” he said, “and it raises significant concerns about the auction program.” Aside from market issues, Bolger was also concerned about the volume of MW awarded to solar projects, saying it does not go far enough. “This is our third RESS auction and it was the smallest one in terms of volume, and the most expensive, which must be something of a concern,” he said.
“We congratulate the awarded project winners as yet, again, it was a strong showing for solar. It's a victory in terms of increasing energy security, reducing import dependence, but it's deeply concerning when we have a significant project pipeline raring to develop, raring to be delivered, and we're running into issues with the auction.”
Ireland has deployed around 680 MW of solar power spread across 59,888 generators to date, according to a recent report by the Irish Solar Energy Association. Most of this capacity originates from seven large-scale plants surpassing 5 MW, totaling 349 MW, and 208 MW from microgeneration solar arrays, encompassing systems up to 12 kW.
The Irish government set a target of producing 80% renewable electricity by 2030.

The company said it will use the funds to expand the business and its services that support homeowners with retrofitting advice. Existing investors include social impact investor, BonVenture, real estate-oriented Proptech1, and private investors, such as Felix Jahn, founder of McMakler, and Christoph Behn, founder of impact-oriented business angel club Better Ventures.
The 42watt technology platform has an algorithm that uses ten data points, such as electricity consumption, or year of construction, to drive the modeling and information modules.
“The algorithm, developed in collaboration with the Technical University of Munich, provides information on the right measures, investment and subsidy amounts, energy cost savings, return on investment and payback period,” Marcus Dietmann, co-founder of 42watt, told pv magazine.
Measures and investments related to items like solar PV, heat pumps, new windows, or better insulation are some of the things that the company offers. Furthermore, there are savings calculators, and guidance on grants at the local, regional, and federal level.
“The data points are used to create a 3D model of the house to simulate energy potentials, such as heating load and PV coverage. In addition, other information such as transmission heat losses (U-values) are calculated over the age of the building,” said Dietmann.
In the future, 42watt plans to offer specialized energy advice modules. “Energy retrofitting a building must become as easy as subscribing to Netflix,” said the company's CEO, Jörg Überla. “That’s why our services will help millions of homeowners on their way to a carbon-neutral home and help Germany achieve its climate goals.”
The name 42watt refers to the goal of reducing energy consumption of existing buildings to less than 42 kWh per year and m2 on average to meet Germany’s climate targets in the building sector by 2045.

Dragonfly Energy has manufactured a lithium-based battery cell using high-purity lithium hydroxide that was recovered from recycled batteries. The proof of concept could help to build a more sustainable, circular battery manufacturing industry, it said.
The lithium hydroxide was recovered by Aqua Metals, which is working on recycling solutions for materials used in energy storage and electric vehicle supply chains. The two companies are working on creating a closed lithium loop – where lithium batteries are sourced, manufactured and recycled – all in Nevada.
Using recycled lithium addresses two major initiatives for Dragonfly Energy, said CEO Denis Phares.
“It helps close the loop by filling in that all-important recycling component, and it provides a ready and sustainable supply of lithium for use in upcoming cell production,” he explained.
The Reno, Nevada-based Aqua Metals pulled the lithium hydroxide from “black mass” – a term that refers to a mixture of crushed and shredded battery cells that have already been used, which contains lithium and one valuable raw materials. Dragonfly Energy used this lithium hydroxide to produce a battery cell with a patented dry powder coating process.
The companies are eyeing the potential of building a closed lithium loop in Nevada, a state they believe is well-positioned to be “the starting and ending point for lithium batteries.” Nevada is believed to have the largest source of lithium in North America, according to the companies, and is also an expanding market for electric vehicles and energy storage technology applications.
Recycling is essential to creating a robust and sustainable energy storage industry in the U.S. and ensuring the country remains globally competitive in the clean energy sector, Aqua Metals’ Cotton told pv magazine USA.
“Recycling lithium ion batteries is the most immediate route to developing domestic supplies of critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel, which are facing increasing supply shortages as the world ramps up clean energy manufacturing,” said Cotton.
The biggest challenge to closing the lithium loop in Nevada as well as other parts of the country will be timing, Cotton said. It is expected that the United States will have nearly a terawatt-hour of lithium battery manufacturing operational by 2030, enough for 12 million to 13 million electric vehicles a year, he said.
“What we won’t have by then is the mines, mineral processing, and refinement capacity to satisfy the raw resource demand,” Cotton said.
Mines can take seven to 10 years to come online and begin producing battery-grade materials, while recycling facilities – which can be operationalized in six months – are constrained by the availability of recyclable materials, he added.
“Making the timing work out for resource demand, manufacturing, and our decarbonization ambitions will be a significant challenge as we create the closed loop systems necessary for a robust electrified economy,” said Cotton.

EnergyAustralia has confirmed that it has secured approval from the New South Wales state government to conduct vital site surveys for the detailed design of the proposed Mt Piper Battery Energy Storage System, which is being developed near the town of Lithgow.
The battery, which will have up to 500 MW of capacity and a duration of up to four hours of dispatchable energy, will be built near EnergyAustralia’s 1.4 GW coal-fired Mt Piper power station, which is set to close in 2040 at the latest.
EnergyAustralia said the battery, first announced late last year, will use the existing electricity and transmission infrastructure and will help to improve diversity and reliability of the electricity network as coal generation retires and more renewables enter the system.
“Energy storage projects, such as this one, are an important part of the national transition to a more secure and reliable energy future,” the company said. “It will store excess energy generated by renewables and release it to customers when needed, providing critical firming support to the [New South Wales] energy market.”
While the Mt Piper project is in the early stages of assessment and planning, EnergyAustralia, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hong Kong-based energy company CLP Group, has previously said if approved, the battery could be operational by the end of 2026.
If the Mt Piper battery project proceeds it will be the second EnergyAustralia-owned battery energy storage system under development.
EnergyAustralia has committed to building a four-hour utility-scale battery of 350 MW capacity on the site of its gas-fired Jeeralang power station at Hazelwood North in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley.
The Wooreen Energy Storage System is scheduled to be commissioned by the end of 2026, ahead of Yallourn’s planned closure in mid-2028.

This is the first time this quarter that wafer prices have decreased across the board.
The price of Mono M10 wafers dropped by 7.79% to $0.379 per piece (pc), while the price of Mono G12 wafers fell by 5.43% to $0.505/pc when compared to the previous week.
Wafer prices have decreased earlier than anticipated, multiple industry sources claimed. The increase in wafer output has outpaced demand to an excessive degree, which is the primary reason that has pushed wafer prices downwards, they concurred.

After the two leading wafer producers, Longi and TCL Zhonghuan dropped their list pricing for Mono M10 wafers to CNY3.1/pc in succession on September 25 and 26, an influential Tier-2 specialized wafer manufacturer reportedly offered Mono M10 wafers for CNY3.05/pc, according to a source.
This source stated that the market price will probably approach the price of this producer, adding that “this manufacturer has a certain market pricing power due to the expansion of production capacity; its newly expanded 40 GW wafer production capacity is currently being installed with manufacturing equipment on site.”
For another source, wafer inventory levels right now are still under control. However, because wafer prices are declining, wafer producers are concerned that, as they create more wafers, future wafer price declines may cause them to lose more money, the source said.
“However, this loss seems inevitable given that cell manufacturers have curtailed their wafer orders out of concern that wafer prices would continue to fall. Wafer stockpiles would build up as a result,” the source continued.
Looking ahead, the degree of the drop in wafer pricing may largely depend on the manufacturing strategies of cell makers and their enthusiasm for buying wafers, a source stated.
