Energy Dome's emission-free energy storage method uses carbon dioxide in a closed loop charge/discharge cycle that can store and dispatch renewable energy onto the grid over periods from four to 24 hours. Energy Dome reports that it plans to build energy storage projects at half the cost of lithium-ion battery storage technology globally. Energy Dome’s first commercial CO2 Battery storage facility is under construction in Sardinia, Italy and now offers the CO2 Battery on utility scale, with performance warranties. Energy Dome also recently signed an agreement with Ansaldo Energia that envisions developing as many as 30 energy storage facilities over the next five years in Italy, Germany, the Middle East, and Africa. The facilities will use Energy Dome’s non-flammable, non-toxic carbon dioxide-based energy storage solution to store and dispatch power around the clock.
BNEF Pioneers annually identifies the most promising and impactful technologies that can accelerate global decarbonization and halt climate change. Pioneers such as Energy Dome are innovators in sectors including energy, transport, materials, manufacturing, consumer products, and agriculture.
“To be selected as a BNEF Pioneers 2022 winner is not only a huge honor, but also a strong validation of our technology and product, the CO2 Battery, which we are deploying at commercial scale,” said Claudio Spadacini, Energy Dome founder and CEO . “We are already seeing strong global interest in the CO2 Battery, which uses tried and tested components, costs half of lithium-ion technology, is highly efficient (Round Trip Efficiency 75+%) and has no performance degradation during its 30+ year project lifetime. We believe the CO2 Battery will help significantly accelerate the clean energy transition by replacing baseload fossil fuels with fully dispatchable solar and wind energy.”

The latest one to up the ante in the electrification race is Japanese automotive giant Honda which has revealed plans to launch 30 EV models globally by 2030 with a production volume of more than two million units annually. This week, the company said it will invest 5 trillion yen ($39.9 billion) to further accelerate its electrification over the next ten years. Honda is striving toward 100% electric sales by 2040, which is a less ambitious goal than the industry average. In terms of production, Honda said it would look to set up EV plants in the Chinese cities of Guangzhou and Wuhan, in addition to plans for a dedicated EV production line in North America. On the battery front, Honda said it is planning to build a demonstration line for the production of all-solid-state batteries with an investment of approximately 43 billion yen ($343.2 million) with a goal to start production in spring next year. Just like Nissan, Honda aims to make solid-state batteries in-house whereas carmakers in the West have been more eager to explore this energy-dense battery tech through partnerships with specialized manufacturers. Honda aims to bring vehicles powered by its next-generation batteries to the market in the second half of the 2020s.
Meanwhile, widespread Covid-19 lockdowns in some parts of China continue to negatively impact the battery supply chain and broader EV industry. Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory remains closed for production since late March, missing out on some 24,000 units to date. Furthermore, Chinese EV maker Nio was forced to suspend operations due to local supply chain issues caused by the impact of further Covid-19 restrictions in several places including Jilin, Shanghai, and Jiangsu. “The price momentum for battery raw materials against the weakened sentiment caused by the pandemic means a slow production pace for the EV battery supply chain is likely in the short term, including precursor, cathode, and batteries,” says Echo Ma, an analyst at Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy. In the meantime, metal supply concerns are driving carmakers to secure core battery component supply deals and explore new upstream solutions. As Rystad Energy says in its battery materials market note, lithium shortage continues to be a major bottleneck in the supply chain and rising costs combined with a directional push to lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistries will continue to see more automakers moving upstream to secure metals supply.
Only this week, US-based General Motors has signed a multi-year sourcing agreement with raw materials company Glencore to supply the U.S. carmaker with cobalt from its Murrin Murrin operation in Australia. The cobalt will be used in GM’s Ultium battery cathodes, which will power EVs such as the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC HUMMER EV, and Cadillac LYRIQ. Glencore already has a long list of cobalt customers including Samsung SDI, SK On, Britishvolt and Tesla. Another upstream deal was announced by Ford. The U.S. carmaker has signed a preliminary agreement to buy lithium from a Lake Resources NL facility in Argentina, marking the first time the automaker has publicly announced where it will procure the EV battery metal. Ford aims to buy 25,000 tons annually of lithium from Lake’s Kachi project in northern Argentina, which is being developed in collaboration with privately held extraction startup Lilac Solutions. Lithium will be mined at the site using Lilac’s direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology, a relatively novel approach that involves filtering the metal from brines and uses far less acreage than open-pit mines and evaporation ponds. Other carmakers that are also pursuing DLE through deals with other extraction companies include BMW, GM, and Stellantis.
Speaking of raw material sourcing, BMW has pledged to use sustainably sourced aluminum wheels from 2024 onwards. According to BMW, the production of wheels has accounted for around 5% of supply chain CO2 emissions, mostly due to the energy-intensive electrolysis used in producing aluminum and the wheel-casting process. Presently, the BMW Group procures around 10 million light-alloy wheels each year, with 95% of these made from cast aluminum, and a shift to a more sustainable production chain is hoped to reduce these emissions by more than half. “Green power is one of the biggest levers for reducing CO2 emissions in our supply chain. We have already signed more than 400 contracts with our suppliers, including suppliers of wheels and aluminum, requiring them to use green power,” says Joachim Post, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG. Through independent audits, the carmaker hopes to save up to 500,000 tons of CO2 per year. Previously, BMW began sourcing aluminum from the United Arab Emirates that was manufactured exclusively using electricity generated by the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park.
Meanwhile, legacy carmakers continue to explore the possibilities offered by the two-way flow of electricity from EV batteries known as vehicle-to-grid (V2G). German automaker Porsche has recently demonstrated the V2G capabilities of its all-electric Taycan in a pilot conducted together with German grid operator TransnetBW and consulting firm Intelligent Energy System Services. The demonstration pilot used five Taycans connected to the grid through the Porsche Home Energy Manager both in domestic and laboratory environments. The pilot was underpinned by a cloud-based pooling system developed by IE2S, which coordinates and controls the charging processes of the electric vehicles in real time. During the test, detailed measurements showed that the target values from the grid control system were met. This applied to both the primary (FCR: frequency containment reserve) and secondary (aFRR: automatic frequency restoration reserve) balancing power. FCR is required to stabilize the grid quickly, while aFRR has five minutes to become fully available.
Finally, when it comes to cutting-edge charging technologies, there is also wireless charging of EVs. One of the pioneers in this field, Israeli startup Electreon has announced the extension of its wireless electric road for trucks and buses in Sweden. Since the initial implementation of the Smartroad Gotland wireless charging project in November 2019, the company has demonstrated the operation of Electric Road Systems utilizing a 40-ton e-truck and a commercial passenger e-bus and has now been approved a €2 million ($2.17 million) budget for the extension. The funds allocated by funded allocated by the Swedish Transport Administration will be used for an upgrade of 400 m of the existing installation as well as to increase the capacity of its receivers to transfer energy to approximately 30 kW and examine a new generation of its technology. The company will also deploy software capabilities, such as its billing feature, which allows it to invoice vehicle subscribers using the Electric Road System. The company will also extend the run of the electric airport shuttle bus, which will continue to undergo testing and simultaneously be available for commercial rides as of summer this year. To date, Electreon’s patented technology has been integrated with a number of vehicles, as part of its ongoing collaborations with auto manufacturers including Renault, Stellantis, Iveco, and Volkswagen.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/18/ai-method-learns-from-experienced-staff-on-perovskite-solar-production-lines/,"MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CALIFORNIA,CHINA,MASSACHUSETTS",MAX HALL,"APRIL 18, 2022",AI method learns from experienced staff on perovskite solar production lines,"There's no substitute for experience and researchers in the US have acknowledged the fact by coming up with a machine learning method for producing perovskite solar cells which can incorporate the observations of seasoned production line staff.
Academics from US institutions MIT and Stanford – plus the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Science and Technology – have come up with an artificial intelligence (AI) system which can include input from experienced workers as well as data from experiments conducted by other researchers, to help control the many variables which can affect mass production of perovskite cells.
The researchers, whose paper has been published in the latest issue of Joule, came up with the AI system to improve the rapid spray plasma processing (RSPP) production method they have suggested for commercial production of perovskite solar cells. An article published on the MIT News website on Wednesday about the research stated: “The [RSPP] manufacturing process would involve a moving roll-to-roll surface, or series of sheets on which the precursor solutions for the perovskite compound would be sprayed or ink-jetted as the sheet rolled by. The material would then move on to a curing stage, providing a rapid and continuous output.”
The machine learning code developed by the academics has been placed on open-source software development site GitHub, from where perovskite solar manufacturers can download it and MIT professor of mechanical engineering Tonio Buonassisi said the researchers are contacting PV companies to make them aware of the code and their RSPP approach to perovskite manufacture.
The AI method has been directed by the researchers to optimize the power output of perovskite cells but Buonassisi said his colleagues are working on being able to direct it to maximize cost and durability, as well as other potential characteristics, at the same time.
Former MIT research assistant Zhe Liu, one of the academics who worked on the project and is now at the Northwestern Polytechnical University, in the Chinese city of Xi-an, told MIT News Chinese perovskite solar companies are focused on small products such as solar roofing tiles but three manufacturers are being pressed by investors, or are already on track, to produce full-sized perovskite solar panels “within two years.”
The research, which was backed by US public bodies the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation, also involved Stanford academics Reinhold Dauskardt, professor of materials science and engineering; doctoral graduate Nicholas Rolston; and Austin Flick and Thomas Colburn; as well as Zekun Ren, of the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Science and Technology.
