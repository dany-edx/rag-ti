https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/24/chinese-researchers-hit-70-kw-density-in-vanadium-flow-battery-stack/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 24, 2024",Chinese researchers develop high power density vanadium flow battery stack,"Vanadium flow batteries are one of the most promising technologies for large-scale energy storage, due to their long cycle life, excellent recyclability, and low fire risk. However, their uptake is largely limited due to their low energy densities compared to lithium-ion technology as well as high upfront cost.
Now, a team of researchers from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed a 70 kW-level high-power density vanadium flow battery stack. Compared with the current 30 kW-level stack, the new one comes at a 40% lower cost.
Boasting a higher power density of 130kW/m3, the new stack is smaller in volume, which results in the lower cost under the same power output conditions. By using this stack, a 20-foot container energy storage unit can be upgraded from 250 kW to 500 kW without greatly increasing the size of power units and the cost of system-supporting facilities.
The research team designed the new stack based on self-developed highly selective weldable, porous composite membranes and weldable highly conductive bipolar plates. It also used a short flow path, an ultra-thin battery structure, and low flow resistance and high distribution uniformity flow channels.
The energy efficiency of the stack is 81% under 70 kW rated power charge and discharge conditions, and 82.1% under 60 kW constant power charge and discharge conditions. In addition, the stack operates stably after more than 1,200 cycles, with only 1.7% energy efficiency decay, the researchers have reported.
“This 70kW-level stack can promote the commercialization of vanadium flow batteries. We believe that the development of this stack will improve the integration of power units in energy,” said Prof. LI Xianfeng, the research team leader.
With a lifespan of more than 20,000 cycles, redox flow batteries can provide a lower levelized cost of storage (LCOS) than lithium-ion batteries. However, the CAPEX per kWh of the most widely deployed type of flow chemistry, the vanadium redox flow batteries, is higher.
With lithium-ion less suitable for storing energy at durations greater than six hours, redox flow batteries offer a cheaper alternative for longer storage durations by vitue of their decoupled power and energy scaling. Namely, increasing duration of redox flow battery storage requires only the scaling of electrolyte storage tanks and electrolyte volumes, whereas cell stack configurations can remain unchanged.

The researchers warned that exclusively considering upfront costs for heat pump could be misleading for homeowners willing to assess their potential savings. They said other crucial factors include future operating costs for gas-condensing boilers using fossil gas, biogas or hydrogen, as well as PV, heating costs, pellet heating prices, and various building efficiency standards.
“When investing in a new heating system, many homeowners primarily look at the investment costs,” the research group said. “Instead, all expected costs, especially the energy source price including the CO2 price share, should be taken into account over the life cycle. The ratio of electricity, gas and, if necessary, district heating is particularly important when choosing the most cost-effective heating system.”
Fraunhofer ISE said in its report that the profitability of heat pumps could also depend on the trajectory of CO2 prices in the future.
“From 2027, supply and demand in emissions trading will then determine the CO2 price,” they added, noting that the price cap will then be abolished by the European Union.
The researchers found that in small German buildings, long-distance heat, air-water, and brine-water heat pumps offer more cost-effective heat supply than gas condensing boilers.
“Even in unrenovated apartment buildings, the current government's incentives ensures lower costs for systems with heat pumps than a gas boiler, because both fossil gas, biogas or hydrogen lead to high operating costs over the life cycle,” they stated. “Profitability can then be increased with the installation of a PV system.”

Italian power utility Enel has secured a €560 million financing package for a 3 GW heterojunction solar module factory in Catania, southern Italy.
“The financing was made possible through a collaborative effort between the European Investment Bank (EIB), supported by InvestEU, and a pool of Italian banks, led by UniCredit and comprising BPER Banca  and Banco BPM, backed by SACE,” Italian bank Unicredit said in a press release. “The EIB financing also includes intermediated loans to commercial lenders for €118 million, which could be increased to up to €342 million in 2024, bringing the total EIB intervention in support of 3Sun to €389.5 million.”
The total investment in the module factory amounts to €600 million, with the European Union and the Italian government contributing up to €188 million to the TANGO (iTaliAN pv Giga factOry) project.
Enel's unit Enel Green Power started building the factory in May 2023, with completion initially scheduled for summer 2023.
The company is betting on n-type heterojunction (HJT) cell with an efficiency of 25.5%. It said this could result in module efficiencies above 24%. From 2026, Enel plans to offer even more efficient solar modules based on tandem silicon-perovskite cells.

According to predictions in a new report shared with pv magazine, annual average growth will be flat over the next eight years, bucking a trend of rapid growth over the last decade. Between 2024 and 2032, global solar installations are expected to reach around an average of 350 GW each year, peaking at 371 GW of installed solar in 2025 and 2030.
“Starting in 2024, the industry is officially past the inflection point, characterized by a slower growth pattern. The global solar market is still many times larger than it was even a few years ago, but it’s natural for an industry’s growth to slow as it matures,” the report says. “In this new era of solar growth, companies will need to be more diligent and focused than ever. Competition amongst suppliers will intensify and efficiency improvements will be critical to remaining profitable”. 
Wood Mackenzie says a few major markets are driving this new growth pattern. China’s solar market is expected to reduce slightly in 2024. While it will continue to be the world’s largest market, it is predicted to shrink due to grid infrastructure investments not keeping pace with project growth, changing revenue schemes for utility-scale solar reducing prices and distributed solar growth slowing.
Europe, which saw annual installation growth of 38% in 2022 and 26% in 2023, is expected to see an average annual growth of 4% over the next five years. The report cites a spike in retail rates as the energy crisis wears off, the slowing down of distributed solar growth and grid infrastructure capacity limits for the slowing down.
Average growth in the United States, which reached 27% between 2019 and 2023, is expected to fall to 6% between 2024 and 2028. But Wood Mackenzie expects the full breadth of the Inflation Reduction Act to materialize in 2024. It predicts this will lead to more contracted utility-scale solar projects, benefits for the distributed solar segment, and see the US domestic module manufacturing sector nearly triple in 2024, with 40 GW of capacity expected to be operational by the end of the year.
The analysis firm also forecasts solar manufacturing will face “a reckoning” in 2024.
Market expansion has been primarily driven by China, whose module manufacturing capacity alone is already nearly three times global demand. This oversupply is driving China to module price record lows and Wood Mackenzie says cheaper Chinese modules will challenge many countries’ plans to build out vertically integrated domestic solar supply chains. It predicts many planned facilities will fail to materialize, while existing facilities will be hard-pressed to stay in business as utilization rates decline.
“This is not new – solar manufacturing is known as being a notoriously challenging business. But the sector has also never been this large. With global demand growth slowing, manufacturers will have to be as innovative as ever to remain a going concern,” the report states.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/24/thermoacoustic-refrigerator-heat-pump-with-direct-coupling-configuration-2/,"HEAT PUMPS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 24, 2024",Thermoacoustic refrigerator-heat pump with direct-coupling configuration,"A group of researchers led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has developed a heat-driven thermoacoustic refrigerator/heat pump (HDTAR/HDTAHP) for high heating-temperature operation. They described the system as a promising technology for low-carbon, high-efficiency and reliable cooling and heating.
“The system can be easily combined with PV energy,” the research's corresponding author, Ercang Luo, told pv magazine. “For instance, a considerable amount of waste heat can be produced during PV power generation and the waste heat can be utilized as the cold source in our thermoacoustic heat pump system and its temperature can be lifted to meet different heating supply demands.”
The scientists explained that HDTAR/HDTAHP systems use the reverse thermoacoustic effect for refrigeration or heat pumping and utilize helium or nitrogen as a working medium. An embedded thermoacoustic engine (TAE) uses the resonance of a standing wave in the working medium to convert heat into acoustic energy.
The proposed system was conceived with a direct-coupling configuration, which the research group said can help reduce the mismatch between the acoustic power generation of the TAE and the acoustic power consumption of the TAR/TAHP subunit. “Due to the energy flow mismatch, the extra acoustic power generation ultimately becomes energy loss in the thermoacoustic system, leading to the decline of working performance but not as it should be,” it explained.
The scientists used a stepped piston (SP) to separate the outlet acoustic power of the direct-coupling unit. This is intended to convey a part of acoustic power in the regenerator of TAE subunit and the rest of into the TAR/TAHP subunit, thus enabling the acoustical power matching.
“Both the outlet acoustic power from the TAE subunit and the bypassed acoustic power enter into the TAR/TAHP subunit. In the TAR/TAHP subunit, the acoustic power is consumed and the heat is continually pumped from the cold-side heat exchanger,” they stated, noting that the outlet acoustic power of the TAR/TAHP returns via a resonator to the inlet of the direct-coupling unit. “So far here to this extent, the system finishes a whole cyclic operation.”
Through a simulation via the one-dimensional calculating software Sage, the academics compared the perfomance of the system based on the SP with that or a reference device with a conventional mechanical piston, with both systems having a direct-coupling configuration and a cooling capacity of 1 kW.
The testing showed that the system with the SP achieved a coefficient of performance (COP) of 1.694 while the reference device reached a value of only 0.6825. This is due to the fact that the heating temperature of the reference system is “seriously” limited by the ambient and cold-side temperatures. “Varying the heating temperature will cause the mismatch between the acoustic power generation in TAE subunit and acoustic power consumption in TAR/TAHP subunit, and eventually lead to the global cooling performance deterioration,” the researchers stressed.
They also noted that the proposed system may achieve a three times higher efficiency at heating temperature of around 500 C and explained that the enhanced heat-to-acoustic conversion efficiency in TAE subunit at higher heating temperature is responsible for the improvement of the cooling performance. “The novel configuration shows different acoustic field distributions because of the bypass component and can significantly decrease the exergy loss occurred in engine’s regenerator,” they concluded.
The system was described in the paper “A highly efficient heat-driven thermoacoustic system for room-temperature refrigeration by using novel configuration,” which was recently published in Applied Energy. “We haven't estimated and compared its cost with the traditional absorption refrgieration system, but it's believed that this refrigeration-heat pump system achieve in low-cost in the future,” Luo said.

Rio Tinto will drive the development of the largest solar power project in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) after agreeing to buy all electricity from the proposed 1.1 GW Upper Calliope Solar Farm for 25 years as it progresses plans to power its operations in the Gladstone region with renewable energy.
Pending development and grid connection approvals, the Upper Calliope solar plant will be built and operated by the Australian arm of Danish-headquartered developer European Energy on a 2,400-hectare site about 50 kilometres southwest of Gladstone on Queensland’s central coast.
Once approved, construction of the solar farm is expected to commence in 2025 or 2026. The project is expected to take two years to construct.
Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm said the solar farm, which is expected to generate 2.8 TWh of clean energy per year, is a key element of the company’s plans to green its aluminum production facilities in the state.
“This agreement is a first important step in our work to repower our Gladstone operations and illustrates our commitment to keeping sustainably powered industry in central Queensland,” he said. “The task remains challenging, but we have a pathway to provide the competitive, firmed power our Gladstone plants need, and we are continuing to work hard with all stakeholders, including the Queensland and Australian governments, on getting there.”
Rio Tinto, which is aiming to halve its global Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions this decade, said the Upper Calliope solar plant has the potential to lower the company’s operating carbon emissions by 1.8 million tons per year.
European Energy Chief Executive Officer Erik Andersen said the supply of renewable and reliable energy to what is one of Australia’s key industrial hubs marks a new standard for industrial energy consumption.
“The Upper Calliope Solar Farm is not just a solar power project; it’s a testament to our shared vision for a greener future,” he said. “This project underlines our dedication to driving the transition towards renewable energy in Australia and demonstrates the potential of solar power in transforming the energy landscape of the region. We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Rio Tinto and other stakeholders to create a sustainable and energy-efficient future for Australia.”
European Energy, which established its Australian office in Melbourne in 2022, is developing a portfolio of wind and solar assets with a combined capacity of more than 2.5 GW. This includes the 1 GW Sawpit Solar Farm being developed near Biloela in central Queensland and the 56 Mokoan Solar Farm which is being constructed near Winton in Victoria.
The Upper Calliope Solar Farm is the first successful applicant in a formal Request for Proposals Rio made for an estimated 4 GW of wind, solar farms and firming capacity to power its operations in the Gladstone region, which include the Boyne smelter, the Yarwun alumina refinery and the Queensland Alumina refinery.
Rio Tinto said it was continuing to assess other proposals, solutions and partnerships to help competitively meet the energy needs of the production assets which require more than 1 GW of reliable power to operate.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/24/all-perovskite-triple-junction-solar-cell-achieves-25-1-efficiency-via-new-passivation-technique/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 24, 2024",All-perovskite triple-junction solar cell achieves 25.1% efficiency via new passivation technique,"An international group of researchers led by the University of Toronto in Canada has developed an all-perovskite triple-junction solar cell that reportedly shows improved homogenization of the halide perovskite film.
The scientists said their new strategy to improve the film quality and the cell efficiency was intended to overcome a typical challenge of monolithic all-perovskite triple-junction PV devices, which usually exhibit increased band offset with charge transport layers and defect density in the wide-bandgap perovskite absorbers. This keeps their efficiencies at lower levels than those achieved by their double-junction and single-junction counterparts.
“We sought to improve bulk and interfacial halide homogeneity in bromium-rich 2 eV wide-bandgap perovskite absorber to reduce energetic losses,” the research corresponding author, Edward Sargent, told pv magazine.
Their approach consisted of a dual bulk and interface passivation technique aimed at promoting halide homogeneity at the interface between the perovskite absorber and the hole-transport-layer (HTL). It involves the introduction of a diammonium halide salt known as propane-1,3-diammonium iodide (PDA) during film formation.
The cell had an area of 0.049 cm2 and an inverted configuration. Inverted perovskite cells have a device structure known as “p-i-n”, in which hole-selective contact p is at the bottom of intrinsic perovskite layer i with electron transport layer n at the top.
The device was designed with a glass substrate, a hydrogen-doped indium oxide (IOH) transparent back contact, a hole transport layer (HTL) made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx) and phosphonic acid called methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz), a wide-bandgap perovskite absorber, a spacer based on phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and polyethylenimine (PEI), a tin oxide (SnOx) buffer layer, an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, another HTL based on NiOx and Me-4PAC, a mid-bandgap perovskite absorber, a buckminsterfullerene (C60) electron transport layer (ETL), another SnOx buffer layer, a gold (Au) metal contact, another HTL based on the polymer PEDOT:PSS, a narrow-bandgap perovskite absorber, an ETL made of C60, another SnOx buffer layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
The energy bandgap of the three absorbers was 1.97 eV, 1.61 eV, and 1.25 eV, respectively.
The researchers said that PDA was found to be effective in interacting with the perovskite precursors and slowing the formation of perovskite films during spin coating, with the films exhibiting delayed crystallization. “We thus speculate that PDA enables controlled growth among halide species and facilitates homogeneous transformation to intermixed perovskite phases,” they explained. “PDA cations bind strongly to the interfaces of adjacent perovskite fragments, allowing more relaxation time for different halide ions to exchange and thereby the formation of uniform mixed-halide perovskite phases.”
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the triple-junction device showed a power conversion efficiency of 25.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 3.33 V, a short-circuit current of 9.7 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 0.78. The device was also able to retain 80% of its initial efficiency after 200 h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT).
The US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL), meanwhile, has certified an efficiency of 23.87% for the device using the asymptotic maximum power scan protocol.
“We observed that while the diammonium salt does not suppress light-induced halide segregation, the wide-bandgap cell retains high operational stability under prolonged illumination, beyond the stability of previous approximately 2 eV cells reported in literature,” the scientists said.
The cell was described in the study “Halide homogenization for low energy loss in 2-eV-bandgap perovskites and increased efficiency in all-perovskite triple-junction solar cells,” published in nature energy. The team included academics from the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands and the University of Washington in the United States, as well as from the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.

Pioneer Power Solutions has announced the launch of an off-grid and mobile EV charging platform. The new product, developed in partnership with Nomad Transportable Power Solutions, is a towable lithium-ion battery system with integrated EV charging. The device is designed to serve events, remote locations, and disaster-response events, in addition to supporting flexible EV fleet management.
The “Zero Emissions e-Boost (ZEeB)” system is a 500 kW unit featuring Kore Power lithium-ion battery cells with 1.3 MWh of energy storage capacity. It can deliver more than five hours of EV charging with a 240 kW charger, and more than 10 hours with a 120 kW charger. The company said it plans to release 750 kW and 1 MW versions later this year.
“While many battery energy storage solutions are available in the U.S. market, they are severely limited by dependence on a high-power, near-site grid connection for recharging,” said Nathan Mazurek, chief executive officer of Pioneer Power Solutions. “By pairing a mobile battery energy storage solution with a mobile, low-carbon recharge system, we are opening immense possibilities for our customers.”
The company said that the ZEeB is charger brand-agnostic and can connect with three-phase, two-phase, and single-phase devices. It supports 480 V, 240 V, or 120 V power applications.
“Whenever electricity becomes unavailable at a site, these units transform instantly into integral parts of a microgrid or Distributed Energy Resource, which we believe places them years ahead of their competition when it comes to peak demand shaving and resiliency,” said Mazurek.
