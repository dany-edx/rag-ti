Alstom's Coradia iLint trains are “now used on the world-premiere, 100% hydrogen train route, in passenger operation,” said the French industrial group. The train can run all day on one hydrogen tank, before being fueled overnight at the Linde hydrogen filling station. The trains are outfitted with Cummins fuel cell systems. “Cummins will provide an additional 54 fuel cell systems to Alstom for an order of 27 Coradia iLint trains that will be delivered to the Frankfurt metropolitan area,” said the US company. They carried out trial runs for almost two years, in addition to Coradia iLint tests in Austria, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden.
University of Connecticut researchers have developed a novel design for a tubular polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell with a replaceable inner electrode and electrolyte. The patent-pending concept design could have nearly twice the energy density of other tubular PEM fuel cells. Planar fuel cells use sandwich-like stacks of rectangular flow field plates made of graphite or metal, which account for about 80% of their weight and 40% of their cost. UConn's design uses a single tube-shaped flow field that reduces its weight by half and requires fewer precious metals. The team said the novel design also addresses compression issues, uneven current distribution, problems with reactant gas transport, excess water removal, and fabrication challenges associated with the design of planar fuel cells. The concept is still in discovery and has I-Corps and Partnership for Innovation (PFI) funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF).
ABB and Hydrogen Optimized (HOI) have signed a new hydrogen-focused agreement. The deal includes an investment by ABB in Key DH Technologies, the parent company of HOI, to accelerate green hydrogen production. “The companies will leverage their respective capabilities and resources to rapidly commercialize HOI's patented RuggedCell high-power water electrolysis technology,” wrote the Canadian company. HOI expects its high-power alkaline technology to be deployed in large-scale hydrogen plants in combination with ABB's high-power rectifiers. The companies said they expect installations from hundreds of megawatts in size to multiple gigawatts. “Other technologies available now operate at low current, which limits the size of each installation – usually at or below 20 MW, and in many cases considerably less. It is the RuggedCell electrolyzer's high-power architecture that makes it possible to have single, large-scale installation of 100 MW and ultimately at gigawatt scale,” Hydrogen Optimized told pv magazine. The RuggedCell is iridium/platinum-free.
SPP-D said that its H2Pilot project in Blatná na Ostrove, Slovakia, shows that hydrogen can be safely distributed in existing gas grids. “From a technical point of view, the mixing device works reliably, dosing continuously and in the required volumes,” SPP-D's press officer, Milan Vanga, told pv magazine. Chromatographic measurements performed on a weekly basis reportedly demonstrate the homogeneity of the distributed mixture, approximately 10% in all parts of the municipal network. “Inspection of the most risky appliances – 32 oldest and/or atmospheric boilers and 25 stoves – after a month of use with a 10% mixture showed positive results in all cases,” Vanga said, in reference to ignition, flame stability, and functionality. The gas distributor said that customers have not reported any relevant issues. SPP-D launched the project on June 15.
First Hydrogen has announced that its two hydrogen demonstrator vans have completed initial commissioning trials. This “step enables the vehicles to be tested in mixed road and driving conditions and to confirm performance ahead of First Hydrogen's real-world operational trials with major fleet operators in early 2023,” said First Hydrogen.
Plug Power has signed a supply deal with Amazon to provide liquid green hydrogen starting in 2025. “Amazon and Plug have signed a deal for Plug to supply 10,950 tons per year of liquid green hydrogen to fuel Amazon operations,” wrote Plug Power. “Using Plug's electrolyzers, liquefaction capabilities and cryogenic tankers, Plug will deliver hydrogen to Amazon beginning Jan. 1, 2025.”
 
 
 
Namibian Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said last week that green hydrogen is set to become a core pillar in the country's economic and developmental agenda. The government selected several green hydrogen pilot projects during a recent two-day conference. Four of them will receive NAD 500 million ($2.98 million) of German-backed funding. 
Germany has approved the co-financing of €223 million for eight hydrogen projects around its biggest port, Hamburg. The German government has selected a total of 62 major industrial projects in Germany for federal and state funding.
Foton Mobility and Transit Systems have announced the arrival of the first two hydrogen fuel cell buses in Australia. Foton has manufactured and delivered more than 1,100 units, including 450 hydrogen buses used during the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022. SinoHytec and Toyota jointly developed the fuel cell systems for the buses.

“Based on the zinc-air secondary battery technology that we have developed over many years, we aim to establish a low-cost, high-capacity energy storage technology with a new ‘flow' design,” the company said in a statement.
Sharp said the new devices will be safer than lithium-ion batteries, as the electrolyte in which the zinc is soaked is a water-based liquid, and the possibility of ignition is extremely low.
A ZAFB consists of two electrodes – a Zn anode and an air cathode. The anode and cathode are separated by a separator allowing ions to transfer across the cell. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) aqueous solution is commonly used as an electrolyte.

“In batteries with a ‘flow' design, the cell and the tank are independent of each other, so it is possible to easily increase the capacity by increasing the size of the tank,” Sharp said. “During charging, zinc oxide (ZnO) chemically changes to zinc to store electricity and, in the discharging phase, when zinc returns to zinc oxide by the action of oxygen contained in the air, the stored electrons are released, so electricity can be extracted.”
The company said the research project has the support of Japan's Ministry of Environment. It did not provide any additional technical details.
*The article was amended on August 29 to reflect that the battery developer is Sharp and not Panasonic, as we previously reported.

The project consists of 11 sub-installations covering a total rooftop space of roughly 665,000 square meters in an industrial park. The entire project uses the CITIC Bo BIPV-Zhiro solution, and is expected to generate around 120 GWh of solar energy per year. Sungrow said the installation should meet 100% of the industrial park's needs.

Traditional rooftop PV is the easiest solution for commercial and industrial (C&I) companies to reach their emissions reduction targets, said Arctec. But it noted that the roofs of the ceramics factories were old, and mostly made with asbestos tiles, and unable to withstand a traditional rooftop PV installation. Instead of installing new rooftops to enable PV, Arctech's BIPV solution performs both tasks at once, by directly replacing the old roofs with a BIPV smart-roof solution.
Sungrow provided inverters for 11 separate rooftops. The company's vice president, James Wu, described the 120 MW plant as “a milestone” in the history of BIPV.
In a January 2022 interview with pv magazine, Arctech's general manager of international business, Allen Cao, said that BIPV has become a mainstream solution for distributed PV. In addition to the 120 MW project in Gaoan, the company has a 40.9 MW BIPV project and an 11.5 MW BIPV project in China.

The Central Bank of Brazil last been consecutively raising the interest rate since March 2021 to fight soaring inflation, which eased to 10.07% in July 2022. With high interest rates, the Brazilian PV market is particularly sensitive to the capex of solar projects. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) still takes a backseat in driving purchasing decisions.
The Brazilian federal government and some states have set up credit lines with more attractive interest rates to incentivize the installation of solar systems. Private banks like Santander and Banco Votorantim have marked their presence at Intersolar South America, while Aldo Solar, Brazil’s biggest distributor, announced a partnership with fintech Sol Agora, offering financing for both consumers and integrators. Other financing lines, like Banco Votorantim’s Meu financiamento solar, were also represented at the trade show.
The Brazilian PV market is headed for more growth over the next five years, but financing will play a key role in consolidating the market and focusing on quality. Companies that have been in the market for longer, with data from installations dating back five to seven years, believe opex and LCOE will become more important decision drivers.
The third and last day of Intersolar South America event was busy until the end. According to the organizers, Solar Promotion, the tradeshow had a record of around 44,000 visitors, surpassing the 28,000 visitors record of last year's edition. The organizers put the number of attendees on the first day at around 13,000, and 18,000 on the second day.  The show had more than 400 exhibitors. Next year’s show will feature an extra pavilion, bringing the total to four.

The results have been confirmed by TÜV Nord in Germany.
“In March, Trina Solar brought the maximum efficiency of 25.5% for large-area 210 × 210mm i-TOPCon cells, setting a new world record for industrial large-area n-type i-TOPCon cell, the company said in a statement. “Trina Solar's researchers in State Key Laboratory of PV Science and Technology developed multi-busbar and novel encapsulation technologies, together with non-destructive laser cutting technology to improve module efficiency. By using large-area 210mm n-type i-TOPCon cells, they brought the maximum aperture efficiency of 24.24% for large-area 600 W+ modules with an area of 2.807 m2.”
The manufacturer said this is the first time that a module aperture efficiency of more than 24% has been achieved with industrial large-area n-type i-TOPCon cells.
In mid-July, Trina achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.5% for a p-type PERC solar cell based on 210 mm wafers. These results, confirmed by the State Key Laboratory of PV Science and Technology in China, represented a world record for this cell type, it claimed. In August 2021, the cell still had an efficiency of 23.5%, which means that it had gained 1 percentage point in less than 12 months.
In a recent interview with pv magazine, Helena Li, president of the company’s global cell and module business, presented plans to release new TOPCon solar modules. However, she said the whole n-type transition is now being postponed. The company now plans to raise its capacity for new n-type products from 500 MW to 20 GW by the end of 2023.
“We are also looking at interdigitated back-contact (IBC) and heterojunction, but first we want to expand our TOPCon business,” said Li.

The cabinet has also approved a proposal to broaden the definition of “vulnerable citizens” who can apply for such subsidies. Energy Minister Natasa Pilides said this means that another 30,000 vulnerable households will be able to apply for state funding, bringing the total number of vulnerable households that can request assistance to 80,000.
Under the government’s program, Cypriot households will be able to apply for funds to help them to install PV systems that operate through the net-metering program and the virtual net-metering scheme. Households that apply for PV net metering only will receive €375/kW, but for vulnerable households this increases to €1,000/kW. However, the maximum subsidy is capped at €1,500/kW and €5,000/kW for non-vulnerable and vulnerable households, respectively.
The ministry of energy said Cyprus has also introduced or plans to introduce €160 million of additional programs for self-generated electricity and energy-efficiency measures in households, businesses, and municipal buildings by the end of this year. Earlier this year, the country launched a new €1.5 million scheme to support installations of PV and battery systems, specifically targeting the owners of electric and hybrid vehicles.
The nation's net-metering and net-billing segments of the solar market have added about 100 MW of capacity to date. The country’s cumulative installed PV capacity stands at about 335 MW.
Renewable power currently accounts for a mere 16% of the nation’s electricity generation. But even more disappointing is that the Cypriot target for 2030 aims for just a “26% share of renewables in gross final electricity consumption.”
pv magazine ran a detailed analysis of the Cypriot solar market in July. It found that the government's sluggish electricity market reforms, as well as its outdated view of solar power, have cost electricity consumers significant amounts of money.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/26/is-the-canada-germany-hydrogen-deal-overly-ambitious/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CANADA,GERMANY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"AUGUST 26, 2022",Is the Canada-Germany ‘hydrogen deal’ overly ambitious?,"Canada and Germany have agreed to support the development of hydrogen by establishing a trans-Atlantic supply corridor to facilitate Canadian hydrogen exports by 2025.
Paul Martin, co-founder of the Hydrogen Science Coalition, said the project is still at a very early stage. “I would be shocked if this is making much less shipping ammonia by 2025,” he told pv magazine, adding that the project has not gone through an environmental impact study yet. 
The so-called “hydrogen deal” signed this week includes a wind project, a hydrogen plant, and an ammonia synthesis loop, or “synloop.” The project is focused on ammonia as a way to ship hydrogen.
“There is the expectation of starting to export clean hydrogen by 2025. Of course the volumes were not discussed,” Ivette Vera-Perez, the president and CEO of the Canadian Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association (CHFCA), told pv magazine.
The details are still not clear, but under their first memorandum of understanding (MoU), EverWind Fuels Company and Uniper have agreed to negotiate a binding offtake agreement for 500,000 tons per annum of green ammonia.
“The signing of this MOU with Uniper in addition to the simultaneous signing of another offtake MoU today results in EverWind having commitments to put in place offtake for one million tonnes per annum of future green ammonia production at Point Tupper,” wrote the Canadian company. 
The two countries focused on green hydrogen, as it is coherent with their energy strategies and ambitions.
“Canada did not develop its LNG export potential in the 1980s, and watched Australia become one of the world’s top exporters. Clean, low-emissions hydrogen gives Canada a second chance, and the government is determined to lead, this time with a zero-emission fuel,” Matthew Klippenstein, Regional Director for Western Canada for CHCFA, told pv magazine. 
Canada and Germany are also strengthening ties in research, and other sectors. For instance, Canada signed two new MoUs with Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz to advance collaboration in Canada across the automotive, battery, and critical minerals sectors. The agreements include Canadian cobalt, graphite, nickel and lithium.
Canada is also clinching deals with companies from other European and Western countries. Sweden’s ABB recently signed a deal with Canadian company Hydrogen Optimized, for example. And Fortescue Future Industries could take part in other hydrogen projects.
“And this is only one of four hydrogen projects being proposed in the Atlantic provinces,” said Vera-Perez.
According to the Canadian Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association (CHFCA), local governments, and indigenous communities are largely in favor of wind and ammonia projects.
“Hydro capacity was also mentioned, but the conversation was centred on on-shore wind, with the understanding that off-shore wind capabilities are also being developed: there was an Irish company invited to participate and showcase their floating wind facilities,” said Vera-Perez.
Not everybody agrees on the potential of Canada in the hydrogen sector, at least from a financial perspective. Canada isn't really a low-cost location for the production of green hydrogen for export, said Toronto-based Martin.
“Newfoundland wind capacity factors aren't any higher than those in Europe as far as I know, nor are costs of deploying wind turbines there dramatically lower either- and then you need to add the costs of making hydrogen and then ammonia rather than just carrying power to a ready market via HVDC cables,” Martin said. “Other locations, where wind plus solar give capacity factors of 70% rather than the around 35% expected from onshore wind, should be able to make ammonia much more cheaply.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/26/rystad-predicts-jump-in-us-solar-wind-deployment/,"MARKETS,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 26, 2022","Rystad predicts jump in US solar, wind deployment","From pv magazine USA
Rystad Energy says the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) could increase total deployments of wind and solar power by an additional 155 GW by 2030.
With the signing of the IRA, long-term projections for solar are rising. About 85 GW of the expected 155 GW of new renewables capacity will come from wind, with 70 GW to come from utility-scale solar.
The solar industry is currently digging itself out of an anti-dumping import tariff investigation that President Joe Biden put on hold for two years while the government worked on the details. However, shortly after that industry crisis was put on hold, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act required 3 GW of solar modules to be held at port.
Some of the benefits that come from the IRA are based on domestic content requirements. It will take time for the United States to ramp up production of solar panels and its supply chain, and at this point it’s mostly speculative as to whether or not the nation will actually hit 40 GW to 50 GW of capacity. However, Q Cells and Meyer Burger recently announced that they will build substantial new manufacturing facilities.
Rystad said that it will take until 2024 for the US solar industry to really begin to ramp up and take advantage of the IRA. It said that offshore wind could greatly benefit from the new law, but it warned that there is limited supply of wind turbine installation vessels that would meet US standards.
The company noted that the IRA gives utility-scale developers a chance to choose between the 30% tax credit (ITC) or a per kilowatt-hour production tax credit (PTC). The group said a 250 MW solar project would benefit more from the PTC versus the ITC right up until high interest rates start to bite, due to the heavy up-front costs.
