However, there are challenges on both the operational and economic levels that need to be addressed to promote different energy community models.
Researchers at the University Carlos III of Madrid have modeled the operation of an energy community with renewables and storage under different technical and economic conditions and analyzed the impact of new hydrogen production and storage technologies on community operation and risk management.
They studied how community management can be directly undertaken by an arbitrageur that, making use of an adequate price-based demand response (real-time pricing) system, serves as an intermediary with the central electricity market to coordinate different types of prosumers under risk aversion.
Their results indicated that the optimal involvement in futures and spot markets is highly conditioned by the community’s risk aversion and self-sufficiency levels. They also found that the external hydrogen market has a direct effect on the community’s internal price-tariff system, and depending on the market conditions, may worsen the utility of individual prosumers.
“We show how an arbitrageur can effectively coordinate the operation of several prosumers and manage uncertainty by participating in two-stage wholesale markets and by setting an adequate demand response program,” the researchers wrote in “Risk management of energy communities with hydrogen production and storage technologies,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.
The arbitrageur hedges its risk by allocating an adequate trading amount in the futures market and by charging the prosumers with a real-time pricing mechanism when the spot market trading takes place.
“Regarding the risk trading part, we can observe that the higher the self-sufficiency level of the energy community, the lower the impact of potential unfavorable scenarios,” said the researchers.
They have also observed how high-risk aversion levels may decrease forward trading in periods with low renewable generation while increase forward trading in periods with high renewable generation. Moreover, they found that the battery storage system could effectively assist in load shifting for the prosumers, reducing their operating costs and benefiting the entire community. Meanwhile, an external hydrogen market could help prosumers to bring in additional profits, while also managing cost volatility.

US-based Revkor Energy Holdings Inc and German industrial equipment provider H2 Gemini Technology Consulting GmbH have announced a plan to build a solar cell and module factory in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.
“Under the terms of the partnership, Revkor and H2 Gemini will collaborate to establish high-efficiency HJT PV cell and module production across multiple project sites, with a targeted capacity of 20 GW by 2026,” the two companies said in a joint statement. “The first phase of the project will focus on building a 5 GW annual production facility, aiming for production to begin by the second quarter of 2024.”
The partners already have a 1 million square foot production plant under construction.
In the Utah partnership, H2 Gemini’s role is to supply the HJT/perovskite manufacturing equipment as well as to provide project management for the HJT production lines, delivering, implementing production processes and transferring IP technology.
Revkor will secure the remaining funding for the manufacturing and research facilities, estimated to be over several billion dollars. The company is engaging with several funding programs that are part of the Inflation Reduction Act as well as the Department of Energy loan guarantee program and CHIPS Act. The Department of Economic Development in Salt Lake City, Utah and the Governor’s office have also been tapped for funding support.
Also planned is the establishment of a research center, which will be a second 1 million square foot facility within the manufacturing complex. The partnership reports that its goal is to use its Utah-based manufacturing and research center to drive advancements in perovskite as well as graphene, plastic recycling and new tire vulcanization methods.
Revkor, headquartered in Miami, Florida, is involved in multiple aspects of the solar energy industry, from solar cell and module manufacturing to EPC services and electrical contracting.
H2Gemini, based in Switzerland and Germany, specializes in making the equipment to manufacture high efficiency solar cells. The company was founded and is led by two former executives from Meyer Burger and Schmid Group.

The device directly produces hydrogen from solar with 20.8% efficiency. It uses an anticorrosion barrier that insulates the semiconductor from water without impeding the transfer of electrons. The researchers published their findings in Nature Communications. “You needed two layers to the barrier, one to block the water and one to make good electrical contact between the perovskite layers and the protective layer,” said Austin Fehr, one of the study's lead authors.
Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) says it will acquire Nikola’s Phoenix Hydrogen Hub (PHH) project. The companies are working toward a hydrogen supply agreement to support Nikola’s Class 8 zero-emission trucks. The PHH is a fast-to-market, green hydrogen project in Buckeye, Arizona. Building activities will proceed in phases to scale alongside demand. Hydrogen production is anticipated by the middle of this decade, but the companies did not comment on the size of the hydrogen investment.
Wien Energie, RheinEnergie, Siemens Energy, and Verbund are conducting a joint operational test on a combined heat and power plant operated by Wien Energie in Vienna, Austria. The partners are mixing hydrogen with natural gas. “This test is the first of its kind in the world on a commercially used gas and steam turbine plant in this power class,” said Wien Energie. The gas turbine model used in the Donaustadt power plant is used in more than 115 systems in Europe alone.
Wilo launched its four modular green hydrogen production systems. The German company said the product is available in four different sizes that can generate power equal to the annual demand of either three, five, or 20 households. The system uses electrolysis to convert renewable energy into green hydrogen, but can also run fuel cells to convert the hydrogen back into electrical power.
Enapter has supplied 30 AEM EL 2.1 electrolyzers and 15 DRY 2.1 dryers for a hydrogen refueling station in Japan as part of a cooperative deal with Tokyo Gas. The German company said the Senju station is the first commercial hydrogen refueling station to use AEM electrolysis in Asia. It added that Enapter's AEM electrolyzers are used to produce hydrogen on site to refuel vehicles.

The IAF has developed special power electronics for electrocaloric heat pumps to considerably raise their electrical efficiency.
With the electrocaloric effect, electrical voltage is applied to an electrocaloric material made of special ceramics or polymers, and the material heats up. As soon as the stress is removed, the material cools again, with the entire process being almost completely reversible.
The IAF scientists claimed to have created an ultra-efficient circuit topology for voltage converters with an electrical efficiency of 99.74%. Today’s heat pumps are limited to about 50% of the physical Carnot limit due to technology, but the electrocaloric heat pump could theoretically reach 85%.
These solid-fuel heat pumps are to be brought to market as an alternative to those based on the prevailing compressor technology, as they promise greater efficiency and do not require refrigerants.
The scientists are now researching components based on the semiconductor gallium nitride (GaN) for higher power density and efficiency. They have succeeded in developing an ultra-efficient circuit topology for voltage converters based on GaN transistors, with an electrical efficiency of 99.74%. The GaN-based multilevel DC/DC converter far surpasses the current state of research of less than 90% recharging efficiency for the electrical control of these new heat pumps.
The increase in the efficiency of the power electronics also has a direct impact on the performance of the entire system, directly leading to a higher coefficient of performance for the entire heat pump system. However, there is still a great deal of research to be done in order to make solid-fuel heat pumps a more efficient and completely emission-free solution for heating and cooling.
“Essential for the realization of a high coefficient of performance of electrocaloric heat pumps is a very high efficiency in the materials, the electronics and the heat transfer,” said Kilian Bartholomé, manager of the ElKaWe project. “If you get all this under control, electrocaloric technology has enormous potential.”
Six Fraunhofer institutes were involved in the ElKaWe project. They have published their results in the IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics.

In the first six months of this year, the country added 78.42 GW of new PV systems, with 17.2 GW deployed in June alone. New solar power installations hit 20.37 GW in the first two months of 2023, followed by 13.29 GW in March, 14.65 GW in April, and 12.9 GW in May.
The China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) says that polysilicon production increased by 65% year on year in the first half to more than 600,000 tons, while silicon wafer production rose by 63% to 250 GW. Solar cell production jumped 62% to over 220 GW in the first six months of 2023, and PV module production surged by 60% year on year to about 200 GW. China also exported more than $29 billion of PV products, for a year-on-year increase of about 13%. Europe was the largest module market for Chinese exports and Asia was China's largest market for silicon wafers and solar cells.
Canadian Solar says that its majority-owned CSI Solar subsidiary has signed an agreement with the government of Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, to invest CNY 11.5 billion ($1.6 billion) in a vertically integrated factory. The facility will produce 40 GW of ingots, 10 GW of wafers, 10 GW of cells, and 5 GW of modules. Ingot production is expected to start in March 2024, with the rest of the production lines to open in the second half of 2024.
The China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association (CNMIA) says that polysilicon prices rose this week for the first time since February. N-type monocrystalline polysilicon prices currently stand at CNY 70,000 to CNY 82,000 per metric ton, up 2.01%. Prices for p-type monocrystalline polysilicon currently stand at roughly CNY 65,000/MW to CNY 76,000/MW, up 2.67%.

“The solar value chain is extraordinary in its responsiveness to crises,” Norway-based residential solar specialist Otovo, Andreas Thorsheim, told pv magazine. “Only a year ago we were in desperate need of inverters and modules, and luckily manufacturers responded with a magnificent increase in capacity that is now benefiting solar buyers.”
In the 13 markets in which Otovo operates, equipment prices are down 9-15% so far this year, indicative of installers seeing their order books shrink and their inventories building up, according to Thorsheim.
“Modules always get sold and installer companies are usually resourceful in getting rid of equipment,” he added. “But of course, if you are hoarding hardware purchased in the first half of 2023 into late summer at the same time as module and inverter prices drop you are building up risk … My view is that residential, commercial, and governmental buyers can expect the lowest prices per watt seen since before the pandemic and energy crises. This autumn is going to be a strong buyer’s market.”
Thorsheim said consumers are somewhat more on the fence.
“But I’m not sure that’s rational,” he said. “As always in solar, those who wait are those who lose. A distributed value chain will always get some price signals slightly wrong, and be a bit oversupplied or undersupplied at times. But then again that’s natural when it’s moving at these crazy speeds, and over time it is one of the factors that makes solar ever more competitive against traditional energy generation.”
He noted that Otovo has a “zero inventory strategy” as a rule.
“During the energy crisis of 2021-22, we did some strategic procurements in order to unblock the worst bottlenecks, but we are luckily done with those,” he said. “At the end of Q2, we held less than €300.000 euros of inventory for a €200 million yearly revenue run rate. Our view is that costs will come down on overhead, equipment and installation labor and we position ourselves to be at the forefront of those declines with no working capital or inventory on the line.”
Thorsheim said the company is looking to concentrate its whitelist with fewer manufacturers of modules, inverters, and storage in order to leverage its ability to influence the direction of purchases in the installer ecosystem and reduce the complexity of catering to many different models.
“The drop in prices at the consumer end of the market, as seen on the Otovo platform, is monotonous and downward, and uniform across Europe. Norway is down, France is down, the UK is down, Italy is down … I could go on and on,” he stated. “The latest modules off the boat are the cheapest. Of course, you should get those new panels.”

The US Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Reclamation have received a letter signed by more than 125 groups urging them to create an initiative to develop solar facilities above federally owned and operated canals and aqueducts.
The request, signed by many leading climate and environmental groups, highlighted the opportunity to cover 8,000 miles of open-air canals with solar capacity. An estimated 25 GW of renewable energy, enough to power nearly 20 million homes, could be installed on these locations, the group said.
“The Bureau of Reclamation has full authority to execute this plan. Congress has provided the Department of the Interior with the clear authority to grant leases to authorize uses of Bureau of Reclamation lands, including for utilities, transmission lines, and other appropriate uses,” said the letter. 
Installing solar over canals comes with significant additional benefits. First, it saves public land from development. The Energy Act of 2020 created a mandate to deploy 25 GW of onshore renewable energy on public lands without destroying an additional acre of habitat. Covering Bureau of Reclamation canals alone could meet this goal.
Further, a solar canopy over canals leads to less water evaporation through shading and cooling. The groups estimate that tens of billions of gallons of freshwater evaporation could be reduced as a result. This may prove critical, as despite having a wet winter, much of the western United States remains in a long-term drought that is likely to worsen as climate change intensifies.
“The Bureau of Reclamation and the states dependent on the Colorado River are already considering unprecedented water cuts to protect the water supplies for 40 million people who rely on the river,” said the letter. “In a study examining similar action on water canals within California, scientists estimated that shade provided from solar panels could reduce the water loss due to evaporation by 63 billion gallons of water per year, an amount equivalent to annual water consumption of roughly 2 million people per year.”
Many federally operated canals are located in Environmental Justice communities, meaning that adding significant solar capacity can help push out the use of fossil fuels in these communities that are most impacted by the negative health outcomes of fossil fuel production and consumption.
California’s Central Valley Project, a large canal system, alone uses approximately 1 billion kWh of electricity annually to pump water. Bringing solar power closer to these systems would offer an efficient system for moving water, displacing the diesel generators used today.
“Given the Bureau of Reclamation’s long history of creating hydroelectric power, the generation of gigawatts of solar power on its canals would be a purely additive benefit, and could even help address shortfalls in electricity generation as when hydroelectric facilities are unable to operate due to low water levels,” said the letter.
Canal-top solar is gaining popularity throughout the world. Projects in California, India, Spain, and France are now underway, with many packing in large utility-scale capacities.

The cell has a p-i-n structure, which means the perovskite cell material is deposited onto the hole transport layer, and then coated with the electron transport layer – the opposite way round to conventional n-i-p device architecture. Inverted perovskite solar cells typically show strong stability, but have lagged behind conventional devices in terms of conversion efficiency and cell performance.
The device also utilizes an “upper” interface between the perovskite and the buckminsterfullerene (C60) electron transport layer and a “lower” interface between the perovskite and the hole transport layer made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx). Both interfaces were treated with an ammonium salt known as 2-thiopheneethylammonium chloride (TEACl). The results were compared.
The scientists said the dual-layer treatment resulted in enhanced efficiency, with a relative power conversion efficiency (PCE) increase of 9% compared to a reference non-treated device.
“Optimization of these interfaces can consequently minimize losses and improve energy extraction, resulting in increased device efficiency and operational stability,” stated the researchers, noting that this architecture creates a 2D perovskite layer at the interface. Cells with this configuration usually exhibit large exciton binding energies and are generally more stable than conventional 3D devices due to the protection provided by the organic ligands. 
Described in full in the paper “Minimizing the Interface-Driven Losses in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules,” published in ACS Energy Letters, the cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.17 V, short-circuit density of 24.5 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 84.6%.
“Besides the increase in efficiency, we also observed a remarkable stability,” stated Tom Aernouts, R&D manager of the Thin-Film Photovoltaics team. “Indeed, after 1,000 h of continuous operation under one-sun illumination, the devices showed a 97% retention of performance, which is among the current bests.”
The group also found that the cell retained 88% of its initial performance after 1,850 h, compared to 55% in non-treated cells.
The academics also used the cells to fabricate a mini module of 3.63 cm2 that achieved an efficiency of 22.6% and a fill factor of 82.4%. “However, commercialization of such applications requires industry-compatible processing techniques, which overcome current stability issues, amongst others,” they specified.

This event, unprecedented for the Netherlands, was named “Poly” by the German Weather Service. It hit the Dutch coast the morning of Wednesday 5 July causing road, train and air travel disruptions, large amounts of damage and unfortunately the loss of two lives.
The Dutch Meteorological Institute, KNMI, and German officials both issued red warnings for areas of their countries.

 
The unseasonal storm was created by a strong low pressure system moving across from England into the North Sea. The adjacent broad high pressure system sitting over Russia resulted in the large pressure gradients that brought strong wind to northern Europe.
This was further exacerbated by “sting jets”, small areas of rapidly cooling air, which saw the Netherlands’ highest-ever recorded summer gust (just over 146 km/h at IJmuiden). Storms such as this one are typically a feature of winter months and are rarely seen outside of October to March.
Poly’s impact on daily irradiance as it tracks across the Netherlands, northern Germany and into Scandinavia can be clearly seen in Solcast maps.

Poly’s low pressure created large areas of cloud that reduced the solar power production for the Netherlands and Denmark but strong winds it brought also saw increases in on and offshore wind generation.
Data from energy.info shows that Solar production on July 5 was significantly impacted, dropping to 944 MWh, one of the worst days for Dutch solar production this month and less than half the production of a clear day. Increased wind more than made up for this gap, with the extensive wind assets contributing over 60 GWh to the grid.

 
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

Tesla has revealed that it has added a new “Charge on Solar” feature to its Powerwall app, enabling automatic charging of vehicles on battery-stored solar generation. By using the app, Tesla drivers can ensure that their vehicles are fully powered by local, emissions-free electricity.
Following a few simple prompts, users can set charge limits and locations, charging batteries to predefined levels, while relying only on electricity produced by rooftop solar arrays.
The app will enable vehicles to adjust charge power approximately every 10 seconds to match excess solar power and power consumption elsewhere in an owner's home.
The batteries will delay charging until there is at least 1.2 kW of stable excess solar to maximize the efficiency and lifetimes of the charging equipment. This helps to account for variability in solar power and home loads.

The scientists used the EnergyPLAN simulation software to determine the renewable energy generation capacities, economic costs, and supply strategies needed to balance the projected future electricity demand in SSA, with the proposed new network, by 2040.
They also utilized Matlab software to assess the possibility of integrating electric vehicles and hydrogen production. “The method and model presented in this study can also be adopted by individual countries as well as regions or continents as a solution to energy poverty and a pathway to net-zero emission attainment,” they specified, noting that wind and solar were the only two renewable energy sources resources considered within the scope of the study, with pumped hydro playing a special role for energy storage.
The 12 countries that would be touched by the proposed transmission line are Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Mozambique, and South Africa. The research group said they chose these countries to follow the grid line and to enhance easy expansion in the future. “The countries have been selected based on data availability, proximity to other countries with sufficient data, land size, and economic status within SSA,” the paper explained.
The academics developed six different scenarios for the years 2030 and 2040, respectively. They estimated an electricity demand for the 12 countries of 678 TWh/year for 2030 and 760 TWh/year for 2040. The average electricity demand is estimated to be 77,186 MW.
Through their modeling, the scientists found that around 665,000 MW of PV deployed in Nigeria, Sudan, Niger, Mali, Chad, Ethiopia, and South Africa may help reduce significantly the energy poverty in SSA by 2030, with the support of pumped hydro storage.
“For the additionally 100 TWh/yr electricity demand in 2040 (800 TWh/yr), the 2030 PV plants capacities will increase by 42,000 MW for Nigeria, 60,000 MW for Sudan and Niger, 80,000 MW for Mali and Chad, 40,000 MW for Ethiopia and 90,000 MW for South Africa,” they noted, adding that Chad, Mali, and Sudan may dominate CSP plant development in the future, due to their enormous solar potential for this specific technology. “To meet the energy demands in 2040, there will be a huge increase in the CSP plants' installation capacities in 2030.”
The researchers found that PV offers the cheapest option in terms of annual investment cost, while wind provides the less expensive solution for total investment cost, which they said makes wind preferable.
They said that to have energy security and achieve decarbonization from electricity production by 2030 or 2040, the ‘Hybrid with High Storage' case scenario is the most viable option, referring to the possibility of high levels of integration between the two renewable energy sources. “It is noteworthy that the RE technologies in this study can be installed centrally or in smaller units in different parts of each country.”
The proposed grid project is presented in the paper “Juxtaposing Sub-Sahara Africa’s energy poverty and renewable energy potential,” published in scientific reports. The research team comprises scientists from the Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology, the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, the Cyprus International University, the Chrisland University in Nigeria, and the University of Sharjah in the UAE.

Indian manufacturers exported $1.03 billion of solar cells and PV modules in fiscal 2023. The United States accounted for 97% of all PV module exports from India during this period, supported by higher demand for modules amid restrictions imposed on modules sourced from China.
The significant ramp-up in domestic module manufacturing capacities over the past 18 months has also supported growth in exports.
In fiscal 2023, solar modules accounted for the majority of India’s PV exports. PV cell exports accounted for just 0.1% of the total.
Export demand depends on US restrictions on imports from China and the development of domestic module manufacturing units in the United States under the US Inflation Reduction Act.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/21/china-solar-module-prices-rebound/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JULY 21, 2023",China solar module prices rebound,"The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for modules from China, rose to $0.168/W, in a week that saw the market contend with a weakening U.S. Dollar and growing prices across China’s solar value chain.
This 5% increase – CMM’s first move up in almost six months following recent record lows according to OPIS data – comes as most contacts noted prices of around $0.17/W and pointed to how the Dollar has depreciated in preceding days.

The upstream segments in China, from polysilicon down to cells, all saw gains this week, buoying module prices. China Mono Grade, OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon in the country, increased for a second week running to CNY64.42/kg, or almost $8/kg.
Module makers in China are raising production now, concurred multiple sources, although they offered different reasons for the move in the current low-price environment.
“Demand is rising now that prices are low,” with the third and fourth quarters a peak period for module sales, one source explained. Key export markets are exhibiting a normal growth rate, a solar industry veteran said. It is smaller, hardly-covered markets of below 1 GW each that, when combined, are driving demand, the veteran added.
For major tier-1 players, increasing production has “literally no correlation with demand,” according to a source at one such company. A Tier-1 manufacturer can squeeze smaller players out of the market and gain market share if it keeps on lowering its prices, according to an experienced market observer.
Moving forward, module prices are unlikely to keep rising as too many manufacturers mean intense competition in this sector, many contacts agreed. “In order to snatch orders, companies will choose to relinquish profits,” explained one source. Echoing the sentiment, another source said there isn’t much profit left to be taken, but it would be good if prices can stabilize at least.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/21/novel-separator-tech-to-prevent-battery-fires/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"JULY 21, 2023",Separator tech to prevent battery fires,"Nuvola Technology has unveiled its patented direct deposition separator technology, which could replace conventional film separators and deliver incremental improvements in safety and performance.
The SafeCoat Direct Deposition Separator material is the first product launched by the Los Angeles-based startup, formerly known as Millibatt. Under its previous name, the venture-funded company focused on small, rechargeable, high-density batteries for wearables, biomedical uses, and Internet of Things sensor applications.
Nuvola said that it has been selected as one of 10 winners in LG Energy Solution's annual 2022 Battery Challenge. The competition brought together more than 100 companies with new battery technologies and business models.
SafeCoat is described as a chemistry-agnostic, drop-in solution for lithium-ion batteries compatible with mainstream lithium-ion manufacturing techniques. The porous polymer coating sprayed directly on the entire electrode surface encapsulates and protects them from a thermal runaway and a potential fire.
According to Nuvola, the battery system’s weak point are thousands of tissue-paper thin folded sheets of a porous plastic membrane that keep electrodes apart and make the battery prone to manufacturing errors and failure.
“During the battery assembly process, a single sheet separator can become damaged, creating an undetectable wrinkle, misalignment, misfolding, or even a tiny tear allowing the electrodes to come in contact. This may cause a fire – days, months, or years later,” said the company.
In addition to improving safety, Safe Coat is said to increase the active battery material volume, improving the energy density by up to 20%. Decreasing the thickness of the separator from the plastic film separator’s 20µm to SafeCoat’s 5 µm layer leaves more room for lithium ions in the same physical space.
According to the company, the Nuvola SafeCoat product is now under evaluation by several major battery producers and car manufacturers. It expect products using the technology to hit the market in 2025.
