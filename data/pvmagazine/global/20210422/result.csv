“This decision,” wrote Rossington, “marks a major milestone in the transition to the smart, flexible energy system essential to Britain achieving its net-zero climate goals at the lowest cost to consumers.”
Ofgem estimates half-hourly settlement will save consumers around £1.6-4.5 billion (€1.84-5.18 billion) by 2045, by enabling smart usage of the network which will facilitate energy demand to play a greater role in the market and, therefore, reduce the need for new, large scale generation facilities.
“Implementation of the new system is expected to take place over a period of four-and-a-half years and to be complete by October 2025,” wrote the interim director. “This transition period will allow extensive testing to take place so any issues can be resolved before the new system goes live.”
It is a timescale which can in no way be considered swift. Chris Hewett, chief executive of trade body Solar Energy UK, said: “One might question the overly cautious length of time set aside for testing in the midst of a climate emergency, but otherwise it is fantastic to see Ofgem is moving the dial on the matter of half-hourly settlement. The decision will undoubtedly enhance innovation in the market, and the role of solar and battery storage in supporting the grid.”
As hinted by Hewett, the half-hourly settlement matters a lot for the PV industry, as well as for other types of on-site renewables, energy storage and demand-side response systems.
Half-hourly settlement – with consumption measured every 30 minutes and billed accurately according to usage – is nothing new for heavy electricity consumers such as manufacturers and large businesses. However, households and small firms have traditionally had their consumption estimated and only recalibrated, through extra payment demands or refunds, after irregular meter readings.
With the U.K. government's Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) estimating 23.6 million smart and advanced meters had been deployed by the end of 2020, the ground is being prepared for all electricity users to be billed according to their half-hourly usage. Covid-19 may have slowed the rate of smart meter roll-out but 3.2 million more were installed last year, according to BEIS.
More accurate consumption data will enable power companies to accelerate the offer of flexible ‘time-of-use' tariffs, which charge varying prices for power consumption depending on the hour of day.
With smarter tariffs available, technology which maximizes the financial benefits of time-of-use consumption – on-site renewables, battery storage and electric vehicles – should also become more desirable.
Ofgem's newly-announced ‘Market Wide Half Hourly Settlement' (MHHS) policy is part of a wider Electricity Settlement Reform Significant Code Review launched by the regulator in July 2017.
The national electricity and gas markets body consulted the energy industry on MHHS from late January until early last month, with the consultation document stating it planned “to place responsibility for management and delivery of the implementation of MHHS with industry.” The regulator has, accordingly, appointed the Elexon non-profit entity formed by energy market participants to manage the MHHS program under its oversight.
While Solar Energy UK welcomed half-hourly pricing, the planned policy would appear to conflict with Ofgem's decision, in 2019, to fix ‘residual charges' for consumers, thus removing one of the benefits of renewables generation offered to companies which had invested capital in reducing their carbon footprint.
As part of its Targeted Charging Review (TCR), the residual charges, which are applied to all electricity consumers to recover the costs of running the grid, were applied on a blanket basis, regardless of whether companies had reduced their grid power consumption by investing in solar, storage or demand-side response systems.
pv magazine has previously reported on the braking effect the TCR has had on the ability to vary electricity price tariffs and on the interplay between residual charges and decentralized generation. By preparing to usher in half-hourly settlement, albeit some way down the line, Ofgem appears to be walking an inconsistent path to net zero.

Transitioning new vehicle sales to electric vehicles (EVs) would support greater deployment of low-cost solar and battery storage, reducing wholesale power costs below current levels, said a report from UC Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy. Consumers would also save on vehicle purchase and operating costs.
To meet the increased electricity demand from an EV transition in the early 2030s, additions of solar capacity would double and storage additions would triple. Those additions were in comparison to a scenario without vehicle electrification, that a UC Berkeley-led team analyzed in a report last year.
Transmission investment needed in either scenario would mainly be short transmission spurs connecting new renewable generation to existing transmission “rather than new investments in bulk transmission,” said the study, which was based on computer modeling. The authors said that recent studies that account for low renewable energy and battery storage costs indicate similar findings.
Vehicle owners would also save with an EV transition, as purchase prices for electric vehicles were projected to dip below those for internal combustion vehicles in the early 2030s. That drop is due in part to expected battery pack cost declines to $61 per kWh capacity by 2030. EVs were projected to have lower operating costs as well.
To power the electric vehicle scenario with clean energy would require adding an average of 73 GW of solar and 30 GW of wind capacity per year through 2035, plus 28 GW of battery storage per year.
The “ambitious target” for renewable and storage additions under the electric vehicle scenario would require policy support, the authors said. A companion report offered policy recommendations.
The electric vehicle scenario would reach 88% clean power by 2035, including existing hydropower and nuclear power. Existing gas units would provide the remaining power and help ensure power reliability at all times.
The study used the same modeling tools and renewable energy cost assumptions as in last year’s “90% clean” analysis from UC Berkeley. The study’s co-lead authors, Amol Phadke and Nikit Abhyankar, of UC Berkeley, were joined by 12 co-authors from UC Berkeley, GridLab, Energy Innovation and UCLA. The study was funded by ClimateWorks Foundation, GridLab and others.

Swiss heterojunction module manufacturer Meyer Burger has concluded wafer supply contracts with several manufacturers and has assured that suppliers will provide wafers made of polysilicon coming from European manufacturer Wacker Chemie.
Meyer Burger needs the wafers for the production of its heterojunction solar cells and solar modules. The company plans to start production at the Bitterfeld-Wolfen and Freiberg factories in Germany this quarter. The facilities will initially have an annual capacity of 400 MW each, that will be expanded to 5 GW by 2026.
By using silicon from Wacker Chemie, Meyer Burger claims that it is meeting the high footprint requirements in the French photovoltaic market, among other things. “By disclosing the supply chain, we are underlining our high demands on the sustainability of our products,” said Gunter Erfurt, CEO of Meyer Burger.
The photovoltaic company claims it wants to produce not only the best but also the cleanest solar modules, whereby not only will the raw materials play a role, but also high ecological and social production standards. “Our new patented technology allows the use of particularly thin wafers that can only be produced with high-quality polysilicon,” continued Erfurt.
Meyer Burger plans to officially present its heterojunction solar modules, with Smartwire technology, on April 27. The delivery of the products should then, probably, begin in the summer. The company is bringing important parts of the photovoltaic supply chain back to Europe with the construction of its production facilities. “Our goal is to source as many of the components of our product as possible in Europe,” concluded Erfurt.

It could be the largest solar park in Germany to date. On Wednesday, the city council of Anklam, a town in the Western Pomerania region of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, approved, by a majority, a resolution for the construction of a photovoltaic power plant with a capacity of 300 MW.
The announcement was made by the project developer, Bavarian photovoltaic company Anumar. After securing this first approval, the company will begin, now, the land-use planning. “We see this as a credit of trust and it is now up to us to present a coherent and binding concept to all those involved in the next few months,” said Anumar managing director Andreas Klier, after the city council voted.
With a swift construction-management process, Anumar can probably start construction of the photovoltaic power plant in mid or late 2022, a company spokeswoman told pv magazine. The solar park will be built on an agricultural field and green area and should be completely refinanced through power purchase agreements (PPAs). Solar parks of this size are not funded by the German renewable energy law, the so-called EEG.
Anumar, however, has already gained experience with large scale unsubsidized PV projects. Recently, the company completed a solar park with an installed power capacity of 120 MW in Bavaria, of which 90 MW are refinanced through PPAs. It had also secured contracts for a further 30 MW in previous public tenders. In addition, in February the city council in Rosenthal, Hesse, gave it the go-ahead for a photovoltaic power plant with a capacity of 75 MW. The solar power plant will sell electricity via a PPA.
According to German consultancy Enervis, at the end of February Spain was the largest market for solar PPAs in Europe, with a project pipeline of 2.18 GW, which represents more than half of the announced subsidy-free photovoltaic projects in Europe. Germany and France are the second and third largest markets, with 786 MW and 392 MW, respectively.

The new budget, which would be available only for private citizens, is intended at meeting the stronger than expected requests for the subsidy registered for the rebate scheme until the end of last year, when the program expired. On the other hand, the government had already allocated an additional SEK260 million for municipalities and businesses in December.
“This is great news and shows that the Swedish government has the ability of steering speed,” Anna Werner, CEO of the Swedish solar energy association, Svensk Solenergi, told pv magazine. “The government's message is, sadly, vaguely worded, though. We do not yet know how many people … will receive the compensation.” 
Werner specified, it is not known, yet, the level of the compensation. In the latest program's round, rebates for a proportion of the cost of buying and installing PV systems ranged from 10-20%.
“Svensk Solenergi has contact with the ministry and tries to help them make a generous, yet waterproof decision,” the CEO further explained. “Relative to everything else, this is a small amount of money for the state but makes a big difference for the private individuals who are affected and, of course, no one should fall between two support systems in the way that happened last autumn.”
The government also recalled that, at the beginning of the year, it introduced a tax break for labor and material costs associated with the deployment of small sized solar, storage and charging points for electric vehicles.
The Swedish Energy Agency (Energimyndigheten) has devoted around SEK4.8 billion to the solar rebate program for the 2009-21 period. The agency said in June that Sweden’s operational PV capacity increased from 689 MW at the end of 2019 to 1 GW at the end of 2020. In March, it revealed that solar generation will likely surge in the 2018-22 period, in line with an anticipated rise in wind power output.

That figure, of which only 570 MW were for use by Longi businesses, saw the Chinese company inherit the ‘world's biggest' crown from domestic predecessors Suntech, Yingli, Trina Solar and JinkoSolar.
The fact sales revenue rose just 66%, year on year, on that much bigger shipment figure tells a tale of falling panel prices but still saw Longi generate RMB54.6 billion ($8.41 billion), for net profits of RMB8.55 billion ($1.32 billion), up 62% on 2019.
The weighted average return on net assets reported by the company was 25.9%, for a 2.84 percentage point advance from the previous year. Net cashflow from operating activities rose 35% to RMB11 billion ($1.69 million).
At year-end, monocrystalline solar manufacturer Longi had an annual production capacity of 85 GW for wafers, 30 GW for cells and 50 GW for panels. Those figures had all risen after the commissioning of projects including a 15 GW ingot and wafer fab at Yinchuan, 10 GW more ingot casting capacity at Longi's Tengchong factory, 10 GW of ingot and wafer facilities at its Qujing base, 7.5 GW of solar cell production capacity at its Xi’an factory, a 5 GW mono cell production project in Xi’an, and four 5 GW module manufacturing lines: at Taizhou, Xianyang, Chuzhou, and Jiaxing.
With Longi estimating its global share of the panel market rose 11 precentage points to 19% in 2020, the company also shipped 58.15 GW of wafers, 31.84 GW of them to external customers.
As demand for solar grew worldwide, Longi said 70% more of its revenue came from the overseas market, with the RMB21.5 billion generated from foreign buyers accounting for 39% of total revenues.
The company launched its first building-integrated PV rooftop product last year and invested RMB2.59 billion ($399 million) into R&D. Its development efforts saw it reduce the average non-silicon cost of ingot casting 9.98% and lower the average non-silicon cost of wafer cutting 10.82%.
Last year saw Longi sign co-operation agreements with major state-owned power companies China Huadian Corp, China Huaneng Group, China Datang Corp, and China Petrochemical Corporation. The business also made commitments in the fields of solar project development, green hydrogen production and industrial supply chain collaboration.
The manufacturer pledged to encourage employees to switch to electric vehicles within a decade and to reach 100% renewables-powered operations in future, during a year which saw it sign up for the RE100, EV100 and EP100 pledges set up by London-based environmental lobbying organization The Climate Group.
pv magazine is setting a new editorial agenda. Via our global UP sustainability initiative, we are diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable, looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly investigations have been carried out into topics including the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green financing and circular manufacturing. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
Those climate and energy consumption commitments, however, appear unlikely to rein in further production capacity expansion, with Longi aiming to raise its figures for wafers, cells and solar panels, this year, to 105 GW, 38 GW and 65 GW, respectively.
The solar giant wants to ship 80 GW of wafers this year, and 40 GW of panels, to generate sales of RMB85 billion ($13 billion).

The company, which includes among its board members Paddy Padmanathan, the president and CEO of Saudi energy giant ACWA Power, is planning to deploy the project, which would consist of 7 GW of solar capacity and 3.5 GW of wind in Morocco. “Xlinks are in discussions with Moroccan community leaders and government regarding the exact sites of the solar farm and working on permitting with the relevant departments,” the company's CEO, Simon Morrish, told pv magazine.
The company is planning to hold international tenders for the project construction and expects to bring online the first 1.8 GW cable at the beginning of 2027 and a second cable two years later. “The technical design for the generation site uses PV modules and wind turbines that are available on the market today,” Morrish specified. “However, this may be revised as emerging technology becomes proven.”

The huge complex would be connected to the UK power network in Alverdiscott, Devon and Pembroke, Wales, via a 3,800 km high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line, which the developer said would comprise four separate cables and will be the longest subsea power transmission link in the world.
The cable would cross international waters and dip into the territorial waters of European countries such as Portugal, Spain and France on four occasions, which, according to the developer, should make planning permits easier to obtain. “For its deployment, three different routes were considered and the one not touching territorial waters reached depths of 3,000 meters, so we opted for the shallowest route that goes no deeper than 700 meters,” Morrish said. “This means we do go inside the territorial waters of Spain, Portugal and France and we are now in the process of beginning the related approval requests.”
Cable losses along the entire transmission line are estimated between 10 and 12%, but these are justified, according to the CEO, by a very low LCOE for the solar and wind power plants in Morocco, which he expects ultimately to be very close to the world record low price of $0.0104 reported for the second round of Saudi Arabia's renewable energy program. “We are currently calculating an LCOE of $0.013/kWh, but we are being very conservative on this, given the size of our project,” he stated.
The company is currently in talks with three major European cable manufacturers for the construction of the transmission lines and the biggest constraint for the project development may be a bottleneck for the cable supply, as the offshore wind industry has a strong need for these components.

When fully completed the project will deliver 26 TWh of firm and flexible power to the UK each year. “The project is expected to generate 7.5% of the UK’s electricity demand and significantly contribute to net zero targets,” Morrish affirmed.
The company is planning to sell the power to the UK grid under a contract for difference (CfD) scheme. “We are hoping to complete a bilateral negotiation with the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS),” Morrish specified. “But we could also compete in future auctions if there was an allocation for this sort of project.” Without the CfD option, the project would have limited chances of being implemented.
Xlinks is planning to inject power into the UK for a CfD price of around £0.048 ($0.067)/kWh, which would be a bit more than around £0.040/kWh for current off-shore wind tenders and much less than the £0.0925/kWh for the controversial Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant currently under construction. “However, the supply of power would be similar to nuclear baseload as it would be able to deliver at least 8 hours during any peak demand for more than 363 days in the year,” he explained.
Overall, Xlinks expects to invest about £18 billion in the project. “We are not doing anything exceptional from a technological point of view,” Morrish stated. “All we are doing is putting various pieces of the puzzle together to deliver a very valuable electricity supply to the UK grid and aid further penetration of offshore wind and the overall decarbonization of the country.”

India's solar imports were badly hit by last year's Covid-19 crisis. The value of imported solar cells and modules — INR2916 crore ($389 million) — from last April to January, was around 75% lower than the figure recorded for all of the previous fiscal year.
That was also down to the impact of an extension to safeguarding duties applied on products from China, Vietnam and Thailand.
China, the largest source of solar imports, saw the value of goods shipped to India from April to January fall 73%, compared with the figure for fiscal year 2019-20, from INR9239 crore ($1.23 billion) to INR2488 crore ($332 million). The impact was even more profound on goods from Thailand and Vietnam which, with respective values of INR115 crore ($15.3 million) and INR95 crore ($12.7 million), saw falls of 86% and 90%, albeit managing to remain the second and third largest sources of imports.
Solar imports from troubled Myanmar, however, soared 403%, to INR35 crore ($4.67 million), during the first ten months of the last fiscal year, from the whole-year 2019-20 figure. Malaysia, which has been exempted from safeguarding duty, appeared to be on course to maintain its pre-Covid shipment levels, with modules worth INR28 crore ($3.74 million) exported during April-to-January. 
The exporters of Chad (INR179 lakh/$239,000), France and the U.K. (INR45 lakh/$60,000 each), and Russia (INR17 lakh/$22,700) also increased their share of the Indian solar cell and module market, although the combined import value of goods from those countries formed a small proportion of the overall April-to-January solar import figure.

French energy company Engie has sold its 60.5% stake in Italy-based storage specialist Engie EPS to Taiwan's largest cement company, Taiwan Cement Corporation (TCC), for around €132 million.
“The sale of Engie's stake in Engie EPS SA is part of the group's strategy to simplify its business and focus on its core activities,” stated Engie CEO Catherine MacGregor.
Announced in September, the new strategy is aimed at focusing on the company's expertise as a developer and owner of assets as well as as an integrator of solutions, rather than owning and developing energy storage technologies directly.
Following this sale, which is still subject to the usual regulatory approvals and authorizations, the company will however continue commercial partnerships with Engie EPS and other major storage solution providers on the market.
The operation will also reduce the French group's net financial debt by around €165 million and generate a capital gain of around €80 million.
TCC announced in early April a plan to invest NT$10 billion (US$352 million) in the construction of a battery factory in Kaohsiung, the largest city in southern Taiwan. The 1.8 GW facility will produce high-charge-discharge nickel lithium-ion ternary batteries, which the manufacturer described as “super batteries.”

Spanish independent power producer Soto Solar España is developing the largest photovoltaic park in Spain, with 1,000 MW of installed power. The company plans to link the huge facility, known as Erasmo, to energy storage and green hydrogen production.
According to its developer, the project has already secured the necessary land for its construction and will be located in the municipality of Saceruela, near Ciudad Real, in the southern part of the country
The storage facility will have a capacity of 80 MW and rely on lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries, a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
It will consist of 20 storage systems with a capacity of 4 MW, which the company said are capable of providing the power-frequency reserve. In addition, Soto Solar has signed a strategic agreement with Spanish gas provider Enagás to set up green hydrogen production through an on-site hydrogen plant that will use part of the energy generated by the Erasmo project.
Soto Solar also told pv magazine that it expects to reach an installed electrolysis power of about 100 MW, the largest associated with a project in Spain. In this regard, the company is working with the National Hydrogen Center (CNH2) to enable the use of hydrogen for the production of methanol, direct sales to industries, injection to the natural gas network, and use in fuel cell electric vehicles. This collaboration will also explore various options for the use of hydrogen.
The solar plant could start production in 2023 or 2024 and will have a generation capacity of more than 2,000 GWh/year that would be equivalent to the annual consumption of more than 200,000 households, up to 3% of Spain's 2030 national renewable generation target.
The project also participated in two Expressions of Interest published by MITECO in February 2021 and December 2020, respectively, which will facilitate the allocation of EU recovery funds towards the energy transition. Soto Solar has been developing the project since 2019 and “has already completed elaborate technical and environmental studies that certify the good state of progress,” the company told pv magazine. It added that “given the magnitude of the project, respect for biodiversity will be prioritized by following the best practices and complementary measures for environmental improvement, including the implementation of circular economy actions.”
Soto Solar, a company founded by Stecc and Hartenlust Solar based in Madrid, became operational at the end of 2018. In 2019, it sold a 50% stake in its business for more than 100 million euros to a group of international investors, which will allow Soto Solar to achieve its main objective for the next five years: the installation of a total photovoltaic solar capacity of 2 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/22/battery-testing-builds-certainty/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"APRIL 22, 2021",Battery testing builds certainty,"From pv magazine 04/2021
DNV’s “Battery Performance Scorecard” helps investors, lenders, and developers inform their energy storage system (ESS) purchasing strategies. It also creates a roadmap for managing and operating specific battery technologies, assessing warranties, estimating replacement costs, and anticipating safety needs.
Much of a project’s success depends heavily on battery performance. As such, a strong focus is placed on the cell and system-level warranties and performance guarantees.
But a manufacturer’s warranty may be designed to cover a broad spectrum of conditions. As such, a battery that performs well in one case can be inappropriate in another. Battery testing helps investors and operators understand an energy storage system’s (ESS) limits in a particular application, allowing for optimal planning and operation. This certainty reduces risk, which increases the project’s value.
The Battery Performance Scorecard, now in its third edition – published in December 2020 – provides results from rigorous, independent testing at DNV’s Best Test and Commercialization Center (BTCC) in Rochester, New York. DNV has logged over 5 million channel-hours in performance and safety testing. The scorecard gives unbiased and transparent information and analysis, so buyers aren’t relying solely on supplier assurances.
Degradation factors
DNV tests four categories of abuse: average state-of-charge (SOC), SOC swing, cell charge and discharge rate (C-rate), and temperature. Those variables govern a battery’s degradation behavior and provide information about replacement intervals, and therefore replacement costs, in a project’s financial model.
DNV also evaluates battery performance in terms of cumulative throughput, which is a battery’s total cumulative discharged amp-hours over its lifetime of operation. DNV prefers “throughput” over “cycles,” particularly as batteries often operate in partial cycles, across different SOC ranges, and at varying current or power levels.
DNV also measures turnovers, which is a battery’s throughput divided by its original capacity. Turnovers are like cycles when the battery is new, but as the throughput increases and a battery degrades, the number of turnovers becomes smaller than the number of cycles. At the system level, a turnover equates to an equivalent full cycle of an ESS as described in many storage off-take contracts.
On average, commercial batteries can attain 1,800 turnovers before degrading to 90% of their original capacity.
Generally, operating a battery at a lower C-rate increases longevity. A higher C-rates implies higher current through the battery. A major factor contributing to degradation at high C-rates is self-heating of the battery cells driven by these higher currents.
The state of charge and SOC swing affect batteries in several ways. Optimum SOC conditions vary between battery chemistries and manufacturers. It is difficult to isolate intermediate regions with precision, but DNV’s tests can generally identify the most degrading SOC range within 12.5-25% of the full range. The presence of this SOC “sour spot” can create operational challenges for a battery, though one can manage them with a battery management system and dispatch control parameters.
And in terms of temperature, most batteries perform best at or near 25 C, around room temperature. Some perform well at higher temperatures, some at lower. Liquid thermal management, which can provide more consistent temperature management, can mitigate some of the risk around performance at different temperatures.
Battery safety
With the release of the 2020 NFPA 855 standard, providing the minimum project requirements for mitigating the fire hazards associated with ESS, the industry now faces a new era of storage safety guidelines and requirements. Burn testing data referenced in this standard, along with the mechanisms of thermal runaway, and the propensity to cascade to other modules, is now assessed through the UL9540A standard.
ESS designs continue to evolve, and it is difficult to create uniform definitions for different cell, module, and rack configurations. For instance, a “unit” varies largely by manufacturer, and the industry still uses a broad array of cell form factors, including cylindrical, pouch, and prismatic cells.
An increasing number of storage manufacturers have new system designs that remove the hazard of human entry into the system itself. Such cabinet-style systems, with controls and access on the outside of the unit, will shift the industry away from intermodal shipping containers, allowing for easier integration of liquid cooling and risk-management features. Furthermore, most new systems include ventilation in the event of a flammable gas release.
With these variations in design, it is difficult to aggregate test data to benchmark the propensity for a given manufacturer’s design to cascade. NFPA 855 offers no prescriptions regarding thermal runaway risk – the extinguishing, ventilation, and spacing requirements in NFPA 855 remain, and rely on the interpretation of UL9540A test results. As battery use and the number of applications grows, this calls for further input from the industry.
DNV has built new safety testing capabilities at BTCC. At the cell level, testing for thermal runaway determines gas release rates and characterizes the composition of off-gas (that is, by-product gases). At the module level, tests determine propagation behavior within battery modules and the thermal energy released when batteries go into thermal runaway. These findings help industry meet the UL9540A standard, assess thermal runaway risks, design battery safety and fire-protection systems, and develop emergency response plans.

The device is based on an 18.6% efficient highly near-infrared transparent perovskite cell built by Dutch research institute TNO, EnergyVille, a joint venture between the Flemish research partners KU Leuven, VITO, UHasselt, and Imec, and the Eindhoven University of Technology, which are all members of Solliance, and a prototype of a c-Si interdigitated back contact (IBC) silicon heteroJunction (SHJ) cell developed by Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic.
Improvements on the perovskite solar cell, which measures 9 mm2, were the decisive factor to increase the overall efficiency of the tandem cell by around 1.5%, the researchers stated, adding that they tuned the optoelectrical properties of the perovskite solar cell to better match the optical properties of the other cell. “Next, we determined the loss factors in the four-terminal configuration and minimized these step by step,” said TNO researcher Dong Zhang. “Finally, we optimized the light management of the complete tandem device, in other words, we maximized light absorption in the tandem solar cell.”
The perovskite cell was also combined with other kinds of solar cells and remarkable efficiencies were also achieved. In combination with a commercial c–Si metal wrap through (MWT) SHJ cell co-developed by TNO and Japanese solar manufacturer Chosu Industry, the efficiency reached 28.2%. In another combination with a c-Si PERC cell provided by Solarlab Aiko Europe GmbH, the German subsidiary of Chinese module maker Aiko, the efficiency was 27.7%.
Furthermore, the research team combined the transparent perovskite cell with a flexible copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) tandem solar cell built by MiaSolé Hi-Tech, a U.S. unit of Chinese thin-film specialist Hanergy, and the efficiency was 27.0%.
“These excellent results form the basis for the next phase in the development, which includes upscaling of the area and the processes,” said researcher Mehrdad Najafi. “Currently, low–cost upscaling processes for large area modules and maintaining the same performance are being developed by the Solliance partners TNO and imec/EnergyVille.”
The scientists also specified that the four-terminal perovskite/c–Si tandem cell could be applied in bifacial c–Si solar modules, as it is able to deliver a total power generation density of 320 W/m², depending on the albedo.
Solliance announced a 26.5% power conversion efficiency for a solar cell combining two different thin-film PV technologies in a tandem configuration in February. In November 2019, MiaSolé announced a new record of 18.64% for a flexible CIGS cell. The landmark achievement represented a significant improvement on the previous record of 17.44%, set five months earlier. In January 2019, the consortium achieved a 21.5% efficiency for a flexible copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) tandem solar cell based on perovskite.
Solliance and the TNO had also said in March 2018 that they had recorded a 26.3% efficiency rate on a transparent perovskite solar cell combined with a crystalline silicon solar cell. A month later, Solliance also announced a new record performance for large-area perovskite modules, with a 14.5% conversion efficiency level.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/22/australian-regulator-proposes-rewards-for-new-ultra-fast-services-in-the-electricity-market/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 22, 2021","Australian regulator proposes rewards for new, ultra-fast services in the electricity market","Electricity market rule maker, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) is proposing to bring new, ultra-fast frequency services into the national electricity market in a bid to secure the system as the penetration of renewables grows.
The AEMC says the fast frequency services will come largely from batteries – but also from wind and solar PV. There is also potential for energy users to change their demand for electricity in response to market needs, also known as demand response, it says. These new services will need to respond in two seconds or less – compared with the existing fastest services that operate over timeframes of six seconds.
The new market ancillary services for fast frequency response (FFR) would be procured through spot market arrangements, which the AEMC says is consistent with the Energy Security Board’s spectrum for how essential system services should be procured.
The need for quick response services is increasing as fossil fuel-based power plants, which have traditionally acted as a buffer against changes in frequency, are being retired. The AEMC says its draft blueprint is a way of rewarding how valuable rapid-fire services are to the market as it looks for the industry to grow in this direction.
“These ultra-fast services have never been provided before and this will introduce more flexibility into the fleet as well as spur on market innovation as solar, wind, demand-response and batteries compete to provide these sought-after services,” AEMC Chief Executive, Benn Barr, said in a statement.
“That’s good for consumers because it will keep costs down compared to an alternative of producing more of different types of frequency response which aren’t as granular. This, plus the benefits of competition and innovation will lower costs to consumers.”

The AEMC also said its fast frequency response work released today aligns with the Energy Security Board’s wider program to develop essential system services – a key plank of its post 2025 market design, which is poised to significantly shift Australia’s electricity system design.
“The foundation of a low-carbon future for the energy sector is building new ways to keep the system in balance and stable through the transition,” Barr said.
“System security is the most critical issue in the national electricity market and a key priority area for the Commission. Our draft determination released today paves the way for valuing new types of fast-response services that can keep the system in a secure operating state – balancing electricity supply and demand in real time. Achieving that balance through stable frequency means the system can ride through most power disturbances.”
Electricity frequency variations, which occur when supply and demand don’t match, must stay within a range of around 50 hertz to avoid blackouts. While small imbalances in supply and demand are common and easily accommodated, larger imbalances are harder to control.
As Australia’s energy mix shifts towards renewables, which generate power intermittently, the level of inertia in the system is forecast to decline – meaning more and faster services to control frequency are needed.
“Today’s draft determination is part of a suite of long-term security and reliability measures the Commission is working on as we think ahead to the services that will be needed in a new-look power system and shift the focus away from emergency solutions. It is the first of the new markets that will be put in place to value system services and introduces arrangements to allow the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to procure fast frequency response services to better tailor the speed of response in the power system,” the AEMC’s release this morning read.
The draft determination follows an initial rule change request from Infigen Energy and extensive consultation with stakeholders.
Submissions to the draft are due by 3 June 2021. If approved, the changes will be in place within three years, which allows AEMO time to develop a product specification and make required IT and system changes, it said.
The Commission is also working on a separate rule change request from AEMO to improve incentives for primary frequency control during normal operation, with a draft determination expected by 16 September 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/22/sunpower-builds-two-brownfield-solar-projects-in-the-us/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 22, 2021",SunPower builds two brownfield solar projects in the US,"From pv magazine USA
SunPower said it will work with Baltimore County to build two brownfield solar projects on the sites of former landfills.
The projects will generate 30 MW of clean energy, equivalent to the power used by one-third of the county’s municipal buildings, including government facilities. The installations will be located on the closed Hernwood and Parkton landfills, and will be the first large-scale solar energy projects in the county.
Construction is expected to begin in 2022 and the two will enter service by 2023.
Under power purchase agreements (PPAs), the county will pay no upfront costs; SunPower and its financiers will cover the cost of developing and constructing the arrays. Over the 25-year PPA timeline, Baltimore County will pay a flat, fixed rate per kilowatt-hour. Through Maryland’s aggregate net metering rule, Baltimore Gas & Electric will credit the solar generated at the landfills against electric loads at other county buildings.
The two installations will provide a big first step towards helping the county reach its sustainability goals, which were announced April 21. County Executive Johnny Olszewski signed an Executive Order setting a goal to complete future renewable energy projects to meet 100% of Baltimore County’s electricity demand by 2026 and 125% by 2030.
In 2016, the prior administration announced a goal to generate or displace at least 20% of the county’s electric demand from renewable energy sources by 2022. With the announcement of the two landfill projects, that goal is expected to be achieved.
