“The system is suitable for renewable energy sources in particular wind and solar and is flexible in terms of geographical adaptability,” researcher Morris Mugyema told pv magazine. “The system does not require ropes and rather utilizes linear electric machines which provide better utilization of shafts.”
Linear machines are motors that produce a linear force along their length and without rotating or producing torque like conventional motors. They have high force density, which results in a lower footprint and more adaptability in small spaces.
The linear electric machine-based gravity energy storage system (LEM-GESS) uses linear machines to vertically move multiple solid masses, or pistons, to store and discharge electrical energy. It consists of a piston, a shaft, a translator, a primary mover and a power converter. The power converter synthesizes electrical power to correct standards for the grid during discharge and to the LEM-GESS during the charging cycle
The system operates in two cycles. First, it uses grid electricity to raise pistons to a given height. It then converts it back into electrical energy as the pistons move down the shaft.
“The energy capacity of a complete system is scaled up by adding shafts to the system,” the researchers said. “The shafts are arranged in such a way that more can be added side by side, which makes it flexible and easy to add more storage capacity.”
The research group designed two different systems for different heights of 100 meters and 1,000 meters.
“The manufacturing and construction cost is assumed to be double the material cost,” they said.
They compared the performance and LCOS with that of lithium-ion storage, vanadium redox flow batteries, and flywheel storage systems.
“The LCOS was determined considering 5000 annual cycles and a discharge duration of 30 min in order to have a fair comparison,” the academics said.
They found that the 1,000-meter system achieved an LCOS of $ 137.20/MWh. They described this as “very cost competitive … the sensitivity analysis highlights that the LCOS of the LEM-GESS is sensitive to CAPEX, efficiency, discount rate and discharge duration.”
The research group introduced the system in “Levelized cost of storage comparison of energy storage systems for use in primary response application,” which was recently published in the Journal of Energy Storage.
“This technology uses solid masses and can achieve high energy density and cycle efficiency which makes it economically viable for specific applications,” the scientists said. “The system can also be used above-ground taking into consideration the technical system height limitations. However, the modular nature of the system would allow easy scale-up in system capacity to meet with the use requirements.”

New Zealand’s first big battery is scheduled for construction in Ruakaka, on the country’s North Island, about 150 kilometers north of Auckland. The battery system is the first stage of a project that will go on to include a co-located 130 MW solar farm. The battery and solar farm will be part of Meridian Energy’s envisioned Ruakaka Energy Park – one of the biggest renewable projects planned for the country.
French-headquartered Saft will supply 80 of its modular “Intensium Shift” battery containers and power conversion equipment for the project. It will also handle installation and commissioning, and provide 20 years of operational services.
The 3 MWh containers, described by Saft as “scalable building blocks,” use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) technology with 40 inverters, Freemaq PCSK GEN3, 20 medium-voltage power stations, and a third-party power management system.
Construction on the Ruakaka battery energy storage system is set to begin in the first quarter of this year. The battery is expected to go online in the second half of 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/11/q-cells-announces-2-5-billion-investment-in-us-solar-supply-chain/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 11, 2023",Q Cells announces $2.5 billion investment in US solar supply chain,"From pv magazine USA
In what is being called the largest investment in US solar history, Q Cells has announced that it will invest more than $2.5 billion to build a complete solar supply chain in the United States. This makes the South Korean company, a subsidiary of Hanwha Solutions, the first to establish a fully integrated, silicon-based solar supply chain in the US market.
Q Cells intends to break break ground on the new, state-of-the-art facility in Bartow County, Georgia, where it will manufacture 3.3 GW of solar ingots, wafers, cells, and finished modules. It also has a facility in Dalton, Georgia, where it will assemble an additional 2 GW of modules. With plans to boost Dalton production by another 5.1 GW, Q Cells anticipates that its total production in the state will reach 8.4 GW in 2024.
The announcement was made by Q Cells’ parent company, Hanwha Solutions, headquartered in Seoul, South Korea.
“As demand for clean energy continues to grow nationally, we’re ready to put thousands of people to work creating fully American Made and sustainable solar solutions, from raw material to finished panels,” said Justin Lee, CEO of Q Cells. “We are committed to working with our customers as well as national and Georgia state leaders to bring completely clean energy to millions of people across the country.”
Q Cells cited Senator Jon Ossoff’s Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, now part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), as playing a key role in promoting additional investments in the United States. The IRA offers numerous tax credits for clean energy manufacturing.
Q Cells has been a top player in the US solar market for the past five years, according to the Q4 2022 US PV Leaderboard report by Wood Mackenzie. It has also been the leading module provider for the US commercial sector since 2019. But now, Q Cells plans to thwart the solar supply chain challenges that are currently stalling development by producing ingots, wafers, and cells, as well as modules.
Q Cells is already involved in the production of silicon. In March 2022, parent company Hanwha Solutions became the largest shareholder in REC Silicon, a silicon producer based in Moses Lake, Washington. That facility is expected to start production in the second half of this year.
Back in March 2022, Lee hinted at the company’s intention to manufacture across the solar supply chain.
“Our commitment to the US is more serious than ever before,” said Lee. “We plan to make investments to secure capabilities across the entire solar supply chain, with the goal of supplying our partners with ‘Made in America’ products that will help the US regain its leadership in clean energy solutions.”
US President Joe Biden made the following statement on QCells' announcement:
“Hanwha Q CELLS announcement to make the largest solar investment in U.S. history is a big deal for Georgia’s working families and the American economy. And, this investment is a direct result of my economic plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. Hanwha’s Q CELLS investment will create thousands of good-paying jobs in Georgia, many of which won’t require a four-year degree. It will bring back our supply chains so we aren’t reliant on other countries, lower the cost of clean energy, and help us combat the climate crisis. And, it will ensure that we manufacture cutting-edge, solar technology here at home. It’s a win for workers, consumers, and our climate. Under my leadership, the United States can and will lead the world in manufacturing once again.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/11/romania-to-expedite-permitting-process-for-solar-on-agricultural-land/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ROMANIA",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 11, 2023",Romania to expedite permitting process for solar on agricultural land,"Romania’s president has promulgated a new law to substantially simplify the permitting process for the development of renewable energy projects on agricultural land.
The move follows the Romanian parliament's adoption of amendments to Land Law No. 18/1991 in June. The changes allow PV, wind, biomass, bioliquid, biogas, storage projects, and transformer stations to be built on plots of agricultural land that are less than 50 hectares in size.
Such land must fall under fertility classes III, IV, or V, with I denoting “very high fertility.” However, it remained unclear after the amendments if the development of small-scale projects still required a zonal urban plan (PUZ), which is one of the most time-consuming stages of the permitting process.
“The entire industry expected that the PUZ would no longer be required for such projects,” Mihaela Nyerges, Partner at law firm Nyerges & Partners told pv magazine. “However, despite the non-unified practice of the local authorities, the general interpretation was that PUZ was still mandatory. Such interpretation was based on the fact that, although not expressly required by the Land Law, PUZ continued to be a requirement for the issuance of the building permit according to the general construction and urbanism legislation.”
Now, the new law removes the PUZ requirement to develop renewable projects occupying less than 50 hectares of agricultural land, with fertility classes III, IV, or V. An amendment to Constructions Law No. 50/1991 also establishes that such projects do not need to present urbanism documentation to be developed. Once the law goes into effect, the only permitting requirements for the aforementioned projects will be building permits and approvals to remove specified land from the agricultural circuit.
“This amendment is a huge breakthrough, as it may reduce the duration of the development process by up to nine months,” said Nyerges.
The new law and respective amendments do not apply to renewable projects exceeding 50 hectares of land, or land with fertility classes I or II.
“Nevertheless, this PUZ process is still blocked at the level of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, which refuses to issue its mandatory PUZ endorsement,” said Nyerges.
Romania has completely halted approvals for projects covering more than 50 hectares, according to Nyerges. The country might limit large-scale solar to projects covering less than 50 hectares. Nyerges estimates that such projects would probably not exceed 42 MW in size.
The new law will soon be published in Romania’s official gazette. It will go into effect within three days of publication.

Australian renewables startup Sun Cable has entered voluntary administration after what it describes as a “difficult” decision in a shareholder dispute.
“Whilst funding proposals were provided, consensus on the future direction and funding structure of the company could not be achieved,” a company statement read.
The Australian newspaper described the news as a “spat” between Sun Cable Chairman Mike Cannon-Brooks and Fortescue iron-ore magnate Andrew Forrest. Whether or not the two major players have had a “spat” is not clear, but Cannon-Brooks' optimism surrounding the company’s future suggests administration is primarily a strategy to get around the impasse.
Cannon-Brookes said he was confident the cornerstone Australia-Asia PowerLink project, which proposes up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of battery storage in Australia's Northern Territory, still has a future. “I’m confident it will play a huge role in delivering green energy for the world, right here from Australia. I fully back this ambition and the team, and look forward to supporting the company’s next chapter.”
The latest edition of pv magazine considers how industry heavyweights are increasingly planning gigawatt-scale assets, looks at the huge potential repowering could unlock for German solar, and examines how solar can help trucking companies in the energy transition. A packed edition also features a focus on the Middle East.
Likewise, Sun Cable founder and CEO David Griffin described the megaproject as remaining “well placed for completion.”
FTI Consulting has been named as Sun Cable's voluntary administrator. FTI Consulting’s Christopher Hill, David McGrath, and John Park will now work with Sun Cable’s management to determine the company’s future. Recapitalization or the sale of the business appear to be likely moves.

It has agreed to buy electricity at $0.102/kWh from the solar facility, which is currently under construction by Bangladesh-China Renewable Energy Company (Pvt.) Limited (BCRECL).
The project is scheduled to begin commercial operations by the end of 2023.
“We are now giving priority to renewable energy,” the board secretary of BPDB, Mohammad Selim Reza, told pv magazine, adding that BCRECL is also developing another solar power plant in Pabna district and a wind power plant in Patuakhali district, from whihc the BPDB plans to buy power upon completion.
Nirod Chandra Mondal, the joint secretary of the power division of the BPDB, said the PPA tariff was approved by the government.
“We are trying to lessen the power shortage by raising electricity from renewable sources,” he told pv magazine.
Chinese company Sinohydro was selected as the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor last year. BCRECL is a joint venture of Bangladesh’s North-West Power Generation Company and China National Machinery Import and Export Corp.
Bangladesh currently has a 950 MW of renewable energy capacity, with 716 MW coming from solar.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/11/perovskite-silicon-tandem-pv-cell-with-textured-wafers-hits-28-1-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SAUDI ARABIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 11, 2023",Perovskite-silicon tandem PV cell with textured wafers hits 28.1% efficiency,"Scientists led by Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have achieved a power conversion efficiency of 28.1% for a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell based on textured silicon wafers.
“Texturing silicon wafers is an important process to reduce reflection losses,” researcher Michele De Bastiani told pv magazine. “The process etches the crystalline silicon along precise crystallographic directions, resulting in a surface covered by uniformly distributed random pyramids.”
The scientists said that texturing the surface of silicon wafers with alkaline solutions is an established process in the PV industry. This enables the formation of randomly distributed pyramids with a uniform size to reduce the front reflection of incoming light, thus improving light trapping and increasing the cell's current output and densities.
In the tandem configuration, the texturing helps to achieve the current matching condition, when each sub-cell generates the same current, at higher values. This is turn results in better performance.
“The direct deposition of hybrid perovskites on textured wafers via solution is not trivial, it is important to control and tune the texturing to avoid shunts at the top of the pyramids,” De Bastiani said, noting that wafer texturing reduces the need to widen the perovskite bandgap and the variations due to the thickness of the perovskite film.
The academics built the bottom cell on n-type float-zone double-polished wafers. The device uses a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, an electron transport layer made of buckminsterfullerene (C60), an amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layer for passivating the wafer surfaces deposited via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and a solution-deposited perovskite film.
Under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved an efficiency of 28.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 1,851 mV, a short-circuit current of 18.9 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 80.1%. The researchers presented the solar cell technology in “Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandems with >28% Efficiency: Role of Silicon-Surface Texture on Perovskite Properties,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.
“The configuration of the bottom cell must be tailored to accommodate the perovskite top cell processing, aiming at high tandem performance,” the scientists said, noting that perovskite-silicon cells could reach higher efficiencies in the future with some adjustments.

Silicon is the semiconductor material at the heart of most solar cells. Thanks to advancements in technology, solar is now powering the world with a lot less silicon.
Research by Fraunhofer ISE shows that in 2004, 16 grams of silicon were needed to produce a single watt of solar cells. By 2021, that number had shrunk to just over 2 grams. That year, when the world’s largest solar farm – at just over 5 MW – was switched on in Germany, it was using 150 W solar panels. At the time, just one of these modules would have included 2,400 grams of the processed material.
In 2021, Maxeon signed a deal under which 1.8 million of its Performance 5 UPP solar modules would serve as the powerhouse of the world’s eighth-largest solar facility – the Primergy Solar farm in Nevada. If we assume that this 545 W panel uses 2.2 grams of silicon per watt, we get 1,199 grams per module. That’s approximately 360% higher output per solar panel – using only half of the silicon.
Of course, we’re going to use massively more silicon in 2023 than we did in 2004. In 2004, we deployed 1,044 MW of solar power, using just over 16,000 t of silicon globally. Bloomberg reports that 268 GW of solar was deployed in 2022, which is about 250 times more capacity than what was deployed in 2004. At 2.2 grams per watt, the 268 GW used approximately 590,000 t of silicon, or 35 times more silicon than was used in 2004.
