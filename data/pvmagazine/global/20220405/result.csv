The usual thermal processing process is reportedly problematic. “Reducing atomic defects concentration and improvements in crystalline order of the metal-oxide thin films would require thermal processing temperatures between 850 C and 1,000 C – but the glass substrate melts already at 550 C.” said HZB. It said that flash-heating the metal-oxide thin film through high-powered lamps could solve the problem. “This heats it up to 850 C without melting the underlying glass substrate,” HZB's solar fuels unit said on Monday. Rapid thermal processing (RTP) heating improved crystallinity, electronic properties, and performance, “leading to a new record performance of 1 mA/cm2 for this material, higher by 25% than the previous record,” it said.
The Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications and the Fraunhofer Heinrich-Hertz-Institut (HHI) in Germany are working on fiber-optic-based hydrogen sensors with a special functional coating around the glass fiber sensor. As the hydrogen sector grows, the focus on security is also increasing. Günter Flachenecker, senior scientist at Fraunhofer HHI, said commercially available safety sensors for hydrogen – typically catalytic heat tone sensors or electrochemical cells requiring an electrical power supply – are dangerous. “Both variants could act as a source of ignition and trigger the explosion that they are supposed to prevent, if the device or the electrical supply lines have a defect,” said Flachenecker. He added that their fixer optic sensors do not have this risk, as they do not require complex wiring. “We work with catalytic layers, for example palladium or palladium alloys. Palladium has the ability to soak up hydrogen, much like a sponge. As soon as the two substances meet, the hydrogen disintegrates into its atomic fragments and the hydrogen atoms that are released penetrate the crystal framework of the palladium. This causes elongation in the optical fiber, which can be measured instantaneously,” said Flachenecker. According to a Fraunhofer HHI press release last week, optical fibers are predestined for sensory applications in a safety-related environment, “because they are robust and have only a small diameter of around a quarter of a millimeter.” 
NTU Singapore is developing new technologies to extract hydrogen from liquid organic hydrogen carriers. It has the support of the National University of Singapore (NUS). Japan’s Chiyoda Corp. and Mitsubishi Corp., Singapore’s PSA Corp., and Sembcorp Industries are also collaborating on the project, according to NTU Singapore.
The European Energy Exchange (EEX) has started working on a hydrogen index based on price assessments by market participants, in order to establish reliable marketplaces for hydrogen. EEX has also said that it is participating in the German-government-supported H2Global Foundation, joining Siemens Energy Global, Thyssenkrupp, Deutsche Bank, Salzgitter, and Uniper. “In the interest of the federal government, the German economy and, last but not least, society, we see it as our urgent task to establish a strong and internationally diversified supply chain for green hydrogen. Trading on an exchange is absolutely a part of this as an allocation and coordination mechanism,” said H2Global CEO Markus Exenberger.
Indian Oil, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), and ReNew have signed a binding term sheet to potentially form a joint venture to develop the green hydrogen sector in India. The three companies would each hold equal stakes in the proposed ventures. “Indian Oil and L&T have signed a binding term sheet to form a (venture) with equity participation to manufacture and sell electrolyzers used in the production of green hydrogen,” New Delhi-based Indian Oil said on Monday. Draft guidelines for India's National Green Hydrogen Energy Mission indicate that around 40% of the hydrogen produced in the country (around 5 MMT) will be green by 2030. 
Green Energy Oman (GEO), an Oman-focused consortium, awarded a contract to Australian engineering company Worley to support its 25GW low-carbon fuels project. “Worley is providing concept feasibility study services to develop and challenge GEO's defined green hydrogen energy project. The project includes optimizing around 25GW of wind and solar generation, transforming this renewable energy through electrolysis into green hydrogen, as well as the production, storage, and export of green ammonia,” Worley said on Tuesday. The consortium includes the Sultanate of Oman’s integrated energy company OQ, InterContinental Energy, and EnerTech, a Kuwaiti government-backed clean energy investor and developer. Worley said the project aims to produce more than 1.8 million tons of low-carbon green hydrogen.
Aragon Hydrogen Valley, the Hydrogen Valley of Catalonia, the Basque Hydrogen Corridor, and the Green Hydrogen Agenda of Navarre agreed on Monday to jointly create the Ebro Hydrogen Corridor, a project that will enhance inter-territorial coordination between regional initiatives in northeastern Spain. The project is supported by regional entities and the government in Madrid. The Ebro Hydrogen corridor will target the installation of 1.5GW of renewable hydrogen production capacity, as well as annual production of 250,000 tons of renewable hydrogen products by 2030. Repsol CEO Josu Jon Imaz opened the launch event. 
The European Investment Bank (EIB), Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO), and Iberdrola have agreed to produce green hydrogen for industrial use. “To this end, Iberdrola will receive €53 million from the EIB and €35 million from ICO,” said the EIB on Monday.
Uruguay's Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mining (MIEM), the Technological Laboratory of Uruguay, and the National Agency for Research and Innovation have launched the Green Hydrogen Sectoral Fund, which aims to finance research, innovation, and training projects. National legal entities, private sector groups, and companies with a proven track record with electrolyzers of at least 1 MW in size can potentially benefit from the fund.
Suncor said it plans to divest its wind and solar assets while strengthening its focus on hydrogen and renewable fuels. The Calgary-based energy company has also announced plans to partner with ATCO on a project to build a world-scale hydrogen project in the Canadian province of Alberta and deploy renewable fuel technologies. “By doing so, we use our strengths, competitive advantages and resources,” Mark Little, Suncor chief executive officer, said on Monday. 
ZeroAvia and ZEV Station have signed a deal to develop green hydrogen refueling infrastructure for airports in California. Several publications have also reported that Hyundai might step up its hydrogen fuel cell aircraft plans, with a focus on longer-range eSTOL aircraft.
Hyundai Motor Group, Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Aramco) and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have agreed to jointly develop an advanced fuel for an ultra lean-burn, spark-ignition engine, with the aim of lowering the overall carbon dioxide emissions of vehicles. “BEVs and FCEVs will be Hyundai Motor Group’s ultimate technologies to achieve carbon neutral mobility,” Alain Raposo, executive vice president of Hyundai Motor Group, said last week. 
Nel Hydrogen – which will open its new hydrogen factory in Herøya, Norway, on April 20 – has received two new purchase orders. Biproraf ordered one hydrogen fueling station for fuel cell vehicles and forklifts in Poland. And Hydrogen Technology and Energy Corp. has ordered a hydrogen-fueling module for zero-emission light vehicles in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The latter order is in line with British Columbia's efforts to open an office to expand hydrogen deployment, with the aim of streamlining projects from proposal to construction. “The BC Hydrogen Office will work with federal and local governments to help attract investments and simplify the multi-jurisdictional review and permitting processes,” the provincial government said last week.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/05/edp-wins-project-with-negative-bid-in-portugals-263mw-floating-pv-tender/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,PORTUGAL",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"APRIL 5, 2022",EDP wins project with negative bid in Portugal’s 263MW floating PV tender,"Portugal's Directorate General for Energy and Geology (DGEG) wrapped up the country's first auction for floating PV projects this week.
The regulator selected seven projects ranging in size from 8MW to 100MW, for a total capacity of 263MW. It launched the procurement exercise in late November. The projects will be built at seven different dams: Alqueva, Castelo de Bode, Cabril, Alto Rabagão, Paradela, Salamonde, and Tabuaço.
EDPR, the renewables unit of EDP, won the biggest project, at 100MW. The floating PV plant will be built under a contract for difference (CfD) regime at a negative price of –€4/MWh over a period of 15 years. This means that EDP will pay the electrical system €4 for each megawatt-hour the floating solar plant generates over the course of 15 years. Neither the additional 14MW of solar nor the wind power is included in the CfD. The project will come online in 2025, with immediate connection availability, according to the company.
In a statement to Portuguese Securities Market Commission (Comissão do Mercado de Valores Mobiliários), EDPR said it “expects that the grid connection capacity awarded in the auction will allow the installation of up to 154 MW of renewable energy, including 70 MW of floating photovoltaic solar energy selected in the auction, in addition to 14 MW of additional solar and the hybridization of 70MW of wind capacity, both excluded from the auction.”
 
In the announcement for the late-November launch of the auction, former Portuguese Environment Minister João Pedro Matos Fernandes said that the grid capacity awarded in the auction would be for a period of 30 years. He explained that “the production would be ensured for 30 years,” but the auction contract would be for 15 years. “Whoever bids, for 15 years produces electricity in the conditions that result from the auction. Then they have the other 15 years to produce under normal market conditions.”
In November, EDPR paid €600 million for an 87.4% stake in Sunseap, a floating PV specialist and Southeast Asia's fourth-largest solar operator.
Endesa Portugal also said this week that it has won a floating solar project in Alto Rabagão, in the district of Vila Real, from the third-largest lot in the tender. The project will start operating in 2023, with 42.5MW of floating solar, 48MW of wind power, and 16MWh of battery storage.

The price for G1 products (158.75 mm/223 mm) is CNY 5.74 ($0.90) per unit, up 2.5% over the previous price. M10 (182 mm) wafers are priced at CNY 6.79 each, 2.1% higher than the previous price. The price of G12 (210 mm) wafers is CNY 9.05, up 2.26%. For the largest size of 218 mm, the price is CNY  9.77, or 2.2% higher than before.
China Resource Power, the energy unit of state-owned China Resource Group, has launched a tender to procure 5.1GW of solar modules. The company is seeking the panels through six different lots, with capacities of 600MW, 1,150MW, 1,250MW, 850MW, 1,100MW, and 150MW. The tender will be finalized on April 25. In February, CR Resource Power finished competed a similar tender to procure 3GW.
The provincial office of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region announced a plan on Friday for the deployment of 16.65GW of solar capacity. Most of the investors are state-owned energy giants. China Energy Engineering Corp. (CEEC) has secured the largest portion with 3.74GW, followed by CHN Energy with 2.5GW, State Power Investment Corp. with 2.4GW, and China Datang with 1.15GW.
Pandemic restrictions ensured that solar developer CSmarter Energy could not publish its 2021 figures by Thursday’s deadline, so it released unaudited annual numbers showing revenue falling from HKD 450 million ($57.4 million) in 2020 to HKD 204 million last year. The annual loss for shareholders also fell from HKD 772 million to HKD 352 million. Trading in the company’s stock has been suspended since April 1, 2021, and CSmarter has been the subject of a winding-up petition since December. The company last year made provisions for payments of CNY 325 million in relation to seven legal cases, in addition to the $4.52 million and HKD 5.51 million that prompted the winding-up petition.
Clean energy developer Beijing Energy International raised CNY 1.2 billion on Wednesday by selling and leasing back solar and wind power sites and PV project inverters to state-owned ABC Financial and Citic Financial Leasing. With 10-year and 12-year terms applying, the developer will eventually pay back the leasing entities at total CNY 1.51 billion.
Polysilicon producer GCL-Poly will now be known as GCL Technology Holdings Ltd., following  shareholder approval to rebrand.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/05/solar-the-energy-workhorse-in-latest-gloomy-ipcc-verdict/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MAX HALL,"APRIL 5, 2022",Solar the energy workhorse in latest gloomy IPCC verdict,"The latest doom-laden report issued by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has highlighted solar as having the biggest potential for energy sector emission reduction this decade.
The “Climate Change 2022 Mitigation of Climate Change” document published yesterday by the IPCC estimated solar panels could reduce carbon emissions by 4.25 gigatons per year this decade, with more than half that potential at a lower cost than reference electricity prices, rising to an additional $50 to $100 per ton of CO2 abated. The report noted, however, that estimate does not include the cost of integrating solar into electric grids.
That carbon emission reduction potential compares to around a billion tons per year abated by industrial materials efficiency; 750 million tons per year from each of building-hosted renewables, such as rooftop solar, and light-duty electric vehicles (EVs), such as passenger cars; and around 250 million tons from heavy-duty EVs, including e-buses.

Buildings are key to our daily lives and significantly impact our health and wellbeing. The majority also have substantial carbon footprints and employ heavy use of fossil fuels across their lifetimes, from construction to their use and demolition. pv magazine’s UP Initiative has focused on the role solar and energy storage can play in greening the world’s urban spaces. Read our urban solar coverage here.

Reiterating the 85% price falls seen for solar in the last decade – and the tenfold rise in deployment volumes – the report stated renewables will remain the best-cost option for generation this decade but will require greater sector coupling and use of energy storage, smart grids, demand-side management, and green hydrogen and its derivatives to fulfill its potential to drive down energy sector carbon emissions.
Only supporting policy, technology availability, finance, and public and political support will enable the ironing out of global imbalances which, for instance, have seen such low take-up of solar in sub-Saharan Africa, the IPCC noted.
The critical importance of the energy sector's workhorse role in limiting global temperature rises this century was emphasized by the authors of the 64-page policymaker summary of the full, 3,675-page report. “In modeled global pathways that limit warming to 2 C … or lower, most remaining fossil fuel CO2 emissions until the time of global net zero CO2 emissions are projected to occur outside the power sector, mainly in industry and transport,” they wrote.
Low-carbon transport
The study estimated transport will be unable to hit net-zero this century, despite the low-carbon contributions of EVs, green hydrogen and derivatives such as ammonia and synthetic fuel (synfuel). That means negative carbon emissions will have to be found in other sectors, including from the direct capture of carbon from the air, which the IPCC said would make a contribution of less than 1% to the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction efforts in its renewables-heavy future scenario.
While green hydrogen and its associated fuels will have to come down in price, the report stated: “Electric vehicles powered by low-emissions electricity offer the largest decarbonization potential for land-based transport, on a life cycle basis.” The document added, more will have to be invested in EV infrastructure, and raw materials supply fears will have to be addressed by resource diversification, circular materials flows, and energy and material efficiency improvements.
While electrification can make a contribution to carbon reduction from short haul shipping and aviation, the sector will need to have much more ambitious climate change aims and governance to do its part, the IPCC stated.
The crucial role to be played by low-carbon electricity and energy carriers in reducing the CO2 footprint of global transport is a notable example of the sector coupling called for by the UN body.
Demand management, materials and energy efficiency, circular material flows, and hydrogen will all be needed to decarbonize industry, with synfuels, ammonia and heat pumps making a contribution in light industry, mining, and manufacturing, the report stated.
The IPCC also noted the potential for renewable energy resource-rich areas of the globe to claim new chemicals and steel industry facilities, as has been noted by African commentators who oppose the idea of exporting all African hydrogen.
Building sector
Solar can also play a part in reducing the carbon footprint of buildings, through retrofitting in established global cities and as stipulated in building codes which could green the building materials supply chain in emerging urban centers. The report stated: “The 2020-2030 decade is critical for accelerating the learning of knowhow, building the technical and institutional capacity, setting the appropriate governance structures, ensuring the flow of finance, and in developing the skills needed to fully capture the mitigation potential of buildings.”
The IPCC reiterated a familiar refrain, that the world must invest three to six times more on climate change mitigation and adaptation to stay below a two-degree temperature rise this century, depending on the scenario modeled. The biggest funding shortfall in such measures concerns the agriculture and forestry sector, the report noted, an industry where more intensive farming and production for less meat-intensive diets could free up more sites for solar and wind plants.
Carbon price
The study said carbon pricing has proven useful to drive emission reductions from low-cost technologies but less so for the more expensive measures needed for hard-to-abate sectors such as industry. The report's authors did take encouragement, however, from a lack of evidence emissions trading schemes had led to carbon leakage, thanks to their design.
As far as paying the bill to stave off catastrophic climate change, pushing the developed world to meet its commitment to provide $100 billion per year to developing countries would be a start, as would sharing, and thereby reducing, investment risk in developing markets, the IPCC added.
And the cost of not coughing up? According to the study, the policies in place around the world at the end of 2020 have us on target for a 3.2 C average temperature rise this century.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/05/carbon-based-htl-free-perovskite-solar-cells-with-26-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,IRAN,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 5, 2022","Carbon-based, HTL-free perovskite solar cells with 26% efficiency","An international research group has proposed a new design for perovskite solar cells without a hole transport layer (HTL), based on carbon-based materials to replace the metal contact and the HTL.
The researchers said that carbon-based perovskite solar cells have reached efficiencies of around 15%, which is considerably lower than those achieved by cells equipped with HTL/metal back contacts. Nanoparticles of titanium oxide (TiO2) in the electron transfer layer (ETL) increase recombination due to the trapping of electron carriers and the low mobility of carriers in the perovskite-filled mesoporous structure, thus leading to the lowest performance.
“This, in turn, affects hysteresis behavior in measuring the efficiency and instability of the device due to the ion migration,” the researchers explained. “Providing a carbon-based planar structure by removing mesoporous TiO2 can not only reduce the device's hysteresis behavior, but also take another step toward commercializing perovskite-based solar cells by reducing the cost of mass production.”
In the proposed cell design, two plasmonic nanoparticles known as Ag@SiO2 and SiO2@Ag@SiO2 were added to the cell photoactive layer and a copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) interlayer was placed at the perovskite-carbon interface. The latter purportedly has excellent semiconducting properties, including high hole mobility, wide bandgap, optical transparency, and thermal and chemical stability.

The HTL-free optimized plasmonic cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 19.72%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.918 V, a short-circuit current of 28.05 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 76.57%.
“The used solution-processed inorganic p-type CuSCN layer with a thickness of 30 nm at the perovskite-carbon interface has increased the device power conversion efficiency by 35% to 26.58%, thanks to the increased open-circuit voltage and fill factory to 1.156 V and 81.64%, respectively,” the academics said, referring to the results of the simulation. “The remarkable improvement of the open-circuit voltage is attributed to better interfacial energy alignment between the perovskite and CuSCN.”
They said they obtained similar results by increasing the carbon working function with suitable additives or binders to the carbon ink. “These results pave the ways to achieve high efficiencies in carbon-based perovskite solar cells,” they concluded.
“Compared to metal electrodes, carbon materials are eco-friendly, flexible, hydrophobic, and have high surface areas and porosities. Hydrophobicity of carbon allows it to be used as the top electrode and HTL, which results in an air-stable solar cell even without encapsulation,” the research's corresponding author, Mojtaba Abdi-Jalebi, told pv magazine. “Flexible solar panels with air-stable properties that can be attached to a variety of surfaces at a lower cost will be possible with these properties. Technology advancements are also catching on in the areas of wearable electronics and indoor photovoltaics. Due to their lower cost and excellent performance, carbon materials are also appealing commercially.”
They described the solar cell design in “Impacts of plasmonic nanoparticles incorporation and interface energy alignment for highly efficient carbon-based perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports. The research group includes scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, University College London, and the University of Isfahan in Iran.
*The article was updated on April 6 to specify that the efficiency increases were achieved through a simulation and to add a statement from the research's corresponding author.

AC Energy, the renewable energy unit of Philippines-based conglomerate Ayala Corp., and Citicore Power, which is affiliated with Megawide Construction, said the project is already providing electricity to the local grid. It is now being assessed by National Grid Corp. of the Philippines (NGCP).
“This huge solar plant shall be managed and operated in-house by our Citicore Property Managers,” said Citicore CEO Oliver Tan. “We have eight solar farms and one micro-grid solar rooftop under our management.”
The new 72MW solar plant is expected to generate 105GWh of power per year. However, the companies did not reveal any additional technical or financial details about the project.
In February, AC Energy completed and switched on a 40MW/60MWh storage facility at the 120MW Alaminos Solar plant, one of the largest operational PV projects in the Philippines. The nation currently supports large-scale renewables via an auction scheme. A growing number of utility-scale solar projects are now being developed and constructed under power purchase agreements.
The country plans to install 15GW of clean energy by 2030. Recent statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) show that the Philippines had a total installed PV capacity of 1.04GW by the end of 2020. Much of the country's build-out has been driven by the national renewable energy law. Most of its solar capacity has also been built and operated under the old feed-in tariff regime, auctions, and net metering programs.

The first of two 150-ton electricity transformers has been trucked into the New England Solar Farm site near Uralla,  in the Australian state of New South Wales, with the second to arrive next Sunday.
The AUD 768 million ($584.3 million) project – developed by UPC/AC Renewables Australia, a joint venture between UPC Renewables and AC Energy – will eventually see a 720MW solar farm colocated with a 50MWh battery. The lithium-ion battery could eventually grow to a capacity of 400MWh. Construction of the first 400MW stage of the solar farm is already underway, including the installation of the tracking system, perimeter fencing and the substation – to which the transformers belong.
German manufacturer Siemens supplied the transformers. They will be fitted by MegaVolt. The project’s construction director Tim Greenaway described the deliveries as a “major milestone.” The project reached financial close in February 2021 and work started just a month later. Two more large deliveries are expected to reach the site over the next month, including the prefabricated building structures containing the switch and control rooms.
Regional transformation
The New England Solar Farm’s two solar fields sit within the area of the New England Renewable Energy Zone (REZ). The project secured transmission approved from TransGrid before the 8GW REZ was announced in July 2020, however.
Once completed, the project will produce around 1,800GWh of electricity per annum, helping plug the gap left by the region’s rapidly closing coal stations.
Last week, AGL shut off the first of Liddell’s four coal fired turbines, marking the beginning of the end for the plant, which will retire this year. While the Liddell closure has been looming for quite some time, operator Origin Energy made headlines when it said in February that it would retire its nearby Eraring coal plant in 2025 – bringing the closure date forward to the minimum notice period.
While Cornwall Insight Australia’s principal consultant, Ben Cerini, estimates that there may already be enough solar in the region to cover the massive exit, the network will require significantly more dispatchable power (such as that from battery storage), as well as additional transmission infrastructure and the acceleration of the renewable energy zone developments to plug the gap.
The New South Wales government plans to deliver at least 12GW of renewable energy into the grid before 2030 to fill the gap left by the closure of the state’s coal-fired power plants.

Tata Power‘s Tata Power Renewables Energy Ltd. (TPREL) unit has commissioned a 300MW solar project in the Indian state of Gujarat.
The solar plant, located in Dholera, is India’s largest PV project with single-axis trackers. It uses 873,012 monocrystalline PV modules and spans 1,320 acres. The project is divided into six plots of 220 acres each.
TPREL, through Tata Power’s EPC unit, Tata Power Solar Systems, completed the project according to schedule, despite challenges posed by extreme weather and Covid-19. Tata Power customized the installation according to local conditions.
“The weather conditions at the site during the construction period were unpredictable due to very heavy rains leading to the 33kV cable trench being submerged in water. However, with the help of floaters, the execution team laid HT Cables at the location,” said Tata Power. “Pre-cast ballasts were also used to lay power cables 500 mm above the ground instead of conventional underground laying. Despite the challenges like weather, machinery, and manpower movement, the project was commissioned successfully.”

The electrolyzer is sold with a compressor, a pressure storage module, and a fuel cell or a Wankel engine to produce electricity.
“Our system is specially designed to work in combination with rooftop PV power generation,” the company's owner, Markus Ostermeier, told pv magazine. “A solar array with a battery may offer the optimal solution for the configuration we are proposing.”
OHS currently produces the system at its headquarters in Schweitenkirchen, near Munich, Germany. It is selling the system for seasonal storage starting from €160,000 ($175,400), depending on the project size and applications.
 “We sell our devices to schools, agricultural and commercial businesses, as well as to multifamily buildings,” said Ostermeier. “One electrolyzer has been recently sold to the university Hochschule Bremerhaven, two to Fraunhofer Institutes in Germany, and another one to a private company in Aalen, in Baden-Württemberg. We have other clients in Switzerland, Finland and France, and we are planning to produce around 10 electrolyzers this year and another 20 in 2023.”
The system works with tap water and is being offered together with bottles to store hydrogen and a fuel cell or a Wankel engine that OHS buys from external manufacturers. The electrolysis kit is hosted by a 19-inch “ERM” cabinet. The basic version consists of the electrolysis module, the base module, and the control module. The electrolysis module's stacks are provided by German specialist H-TEC Systems. The system has capacities ranging from 1kW to 100 kW, which corresponds to hydrogen production of 0.2-20 Nm3/h.
As for the power supply, the system operators may choose between an AC/DC power supply with a 400VAC three-phase connection or a DC/DC power supply with a 48 VDC connection. The stack of the electrolysis module is cooled during operation by a standard cooler based on deionized water and the operating temperature is between 55 and 65 C. The heat can be used to support the production of hot water.
“The hydrogen from our system can also be utilized for laboratory applications or as fuel for cars, trucks, forklifts or other vehicles,” Ostermeier said.
Given an electricity price of around €10/MWh, the system should be able to provide green hydrogen at a cost of approximately €12 per kg. “Thanks to its modular design, hydrogen production can be individually and cost-effectively adapted to the different areas of application,” said Ostermeier.

Geothermal heat pumps use the thermal properties of subsurface rock to help heat and cool buildings, and when powered by solar, they eliminate the use of fossil fuels. While geothermal is becoming the new clean heating and cooling system for residential use, they can also be used in commercial or community installations.
At the University of California, Berkeley, engineers have been digging a massive hole eight inches wide and 400 feet deep in order to study the properties of the bedrock. The want to see if it’s a good candidate for a geothermal heat pump system. If so, the clean energy system would help push UC Berkeley closer to its goal of moving off of all fossil fuels by 2030.
“Nobody has ever drilled this deep beneath the campus,” said Kenichi Soga, the chancellor’s Pprofessor and Donald H. McLaughlin chair in mineral engineering at UC Berkeley. “Most of the boreholes that we have on campus are used for designing new buildings and typically only go down to 60 or 80 feet. Now, we’re going to 400 feet. It’s going to let us see what is happening at that depth and better understand the possibility of using geothermal heat pumps on campus.”
The campus is currently heated with steam and electricity from its 30-plus year old on-campus natural gas-fired cogeneration plant that serves over 100 buildings and 12 million square feet.  While the cogeneration plant is nearing the end of its life and will need to be replaced, it is also a major emitter of greenhouse gases, responsible for 71% of the 190,00 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent produced by the campus every year. If the school turns to geothermal for all of its heating and cooling needs, Berkeley will be the first University of California campus to achieve on-site zero-carbon energy goals and meet the State’s intent to get large emitters to reduce emissions to levels below Cap-and-Trade thresholds, according to the Berkely Clean Energy Campus committee.
Geothermal heat pump systems use the thermal properties of the near underground to provide heating and cooling through a network of water pipes that run through shallow boreholes that extend approximately 400 to 500 feet below the surface. The way the systems work is by taking heat that is generated by cooling buildings during the summer and storing it underground, where it can be used to heat buildings during the winter.
By replacing the cogeneration plant with a new geothermal system that uses electricity for power and thermal needs, and providing the electricity from wind and solar, the campus’s future power, heating and cooling needs would be entirely carbon-free.
“We need to replace this cogeneration plant because its useful life is almost over, and we want to pivot and build something for the future,” said Kira Stoll, chief sustainability and carbon solutions officer at UC Berkeley. “Our goal is to have the campus transition to using 100% clean energy to heat and cool our buildings by 2028. I’m looking forward to finding whether we do have geothermal potential on the campus and whether we can integrate that into our plans to make a very efficient clean energy system.”
To determine the feasibility of geothermal for campus-wide use, the research team will be making detailed measurements of the geological conditions hundreds of feet below the campus
Typically, ground-source heat pumps are used for residential homes and are not as commonly used for larger installations, such as for a campus community. But for three years, through a project sponsored by the US Department of Energy’s Geothermal Technologies Office, researchers from UC Berkeley and Berkeley Lab have been investigating how communities can use ground source heat pumps and other geothermal technologies to provide clean energy to communities.
Before the school can commit to geothermal, the team will need to thoroughly explore the geological conditions hundreds of feet below the surface of campus.
“Designing geothermal systems correctly is very important for reducing costs and ensuring their overall effectiveness,” Nico said. “The better you understand what’s happening underground, the better you can design and build your system.”
To make its geological studies, the research team will install a variety of instruments to monitor the conditions underground. These instruments, which were donated by Berkeley Lab or funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation, include a geothermal heat loop, which will pump water deep into the borehole and back out again, allowing the team to monitor how the trip underground impacts the water temperature. In addition, fiber optic cables will measure the temperature and vibrations at different strata of the soil, and pressure gauges will measure the groundwater pressure at different depths.
Taka’aki Taira, a research seismologist at the Berkeley Seismology Lab, will also be installing a device called a geophone to measure seismic activity. Data from the geophone, along with the Seismology Lab’s network of seismic sensors, will be used to explore micro-earthquake activity near the campus.
“If you put the sensor deep in the ground, you can minimize the noise caused by cars or humans,” Taira said. “It makes it easier to see small vibrations, such as those caused by the Hayward Fault.”
The data gathered from the borehole will allow the research team to build a “digital twin” of the campus heating system, which is a detailed model of both the heating needs of the buildings above ground and the rock and groundwater conditions below ground.
With this model, the researchers will be able to run simulations to determine the most efficient design for the new system.
When installing geothermal for a residence, only one or two boreholes are needed, as opposed to a large system such as that required on the Berkeley campus. To heat and cool its large buildings they may need hundreds of boreholes. And because drilling boreholes is one of the largest costs associated with geothermal heat storage, it is critical to know how many are needed, how deep they should be, and where they should be located
“Our research is looking at whether these systems are more efficient using a centralized field of ground source heat pumps, where you have a lot of boreholes placed in one location, or whether it better to have boreholes placed in discrete locations across campus,” said Soga.
In addition to contributing to a new clean energy system on campus, the project is also helping to train the next generation of scientists and engineers on how to design and implement these systems in the future. Soga said he hopes the undergraduate and graduate students working on the project start to see how these different technologies, including geothermal heat pumps and renewable energy, can work together to help decarbonize our energy needs.
The primary support for this initial borehole was provided by The Green Initiative Fund, a grant program funded by UC Berkeley student fees and administered by a student-majority committee.
