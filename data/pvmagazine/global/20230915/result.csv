The company cites data from China’s National Energy Administration as showing CNY 134.9 billion ($15.8 billion) of investment in domestic PV construction in the first half of 2023 – the highest among all power generation sources. The Norwegian market research company also predicts 165 GW of potential installations in 2024 and 170 GW in 2025. It expects China's installed solar PV capacity to double over the next three years, from 500 GW in 2023 to 1,000 GW by the end of 2026. Yicong Zhu, senior renewables analyst at Rystad, attributes this anticipated growth to a “significant boost in large-scale projects” under a national program that was launched in June 2021. “Although most distributed PV systems are installed on rooftops, not all of them are used for residential purposes,” says Zhu. “Around two-thirds of the distributed PV capacity in China is utilized by the commercial and industrial sectors and these projects can vary from tens to more than 100 MW.”
GCL says that one of its subsidiaries, Henan GCL Energy Technology, has signed an investment agreement with the municipal government of Luohe, Henan province. The CNY 6 billion ($833 million) deal involves the construction of a lithium factory with a capacity of 100,000 tons.
Canadian Solar Inc. says will have 50.4 GW of ingot casting capacity and 60 GW of wafer cutting capacity by the end of 2024. It also expects to expand solar cell production to 70 GW and PV module production to 80 GW.
Mingyang Group has signed a CNY 10 billion investment agreement with the municipal authorities in Maanshan, Henan province. The wind power specialist says it plans to build a 10 GW heterojunction (HJT) solar cell and module factory in the city. In May 2021, Mingyang invested in 5 GW of HJT cell production capacity in Yancheng, Jiangsu province. It also set up a separate 2 GW HJT cell capacity factory in Shaoguan, Guangdong province.
Three Gorges Group has announced the results of its 2023 PV module framework centralized procurement exercise, with winning bids from JA Solar, Das Solar, Tongwei, Trina Solar, and JinkoSolar. JA Solar secured a contract to supply up to 3 GW of P-type 182 mm modules, with power outputs of 545Wp or higher. Tongwei has been chosen to supply 500 MW of P-type 210 mm panels, with power outputs of 660 Wp or higher. JinkoSolar a deal to supply N-type TOPCon panels, with 182 mm wafers or higher.
Xinyi Solar Holdings says it plans to issue ordinary and new shares, representing up to 10.00% of company shares, pending shareholder approval, as it shifts from the ChiNext Market to the main board of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The company plans to allocate about 30% the funds for the fifth phase of investment in a solar glass production line in Melaka, Malaysia. It will use 25% for solar glass production in China's Yunnan province, and 15% to set up a solar glass production line in Jiangsu province. The remainder will be used as general working capital.

Their study – “Feasibility analysis of green hydrogen production from oceanic energy,” recently published in Heliyon – underscores the significance of marine farms with capacity factors equal to or exceeding 50% and wind speeds surpassing 7 meters per second for offshore wind farms. Proximity to the coast enhances economic viability and flexibility while minimizing energy losses. The researchers said that the most suitable equipment for marine conditions are PEME electrolyzers, due to their faster response times to intermittent energy from marine energy sources. They also discussed cost-effective approaches to transport and store wind energy, electric cables for short distances, and hydrogen shipping for distances exceeding 1,000 km. For large hydrogen quantities, they recommend storage in salt caves.
Turkey has started talks with the United Arab Emirates to produce hydrogen and construct an offshore wind facility in Mediterranean waters. “We have a great potential in renewable energy, especially solar and wind,” Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar reportedly said. On social media, he outlined Turkey's energy goals: 42,000 MW of solar, 18,000 MW of wind, and 5,000 MW of offshore wind power by 2035. He also emphasized Turkey's focus on technology transfer in negotiations with Russia for a second nuclear power plant.
Lhyfe and Exogen have agreed to jointly provide decarbonization solutions for industrial steam, district heating, and mobility applications using green hydrogen. Lhyfe said there is a growing demand from multinational companies and industrial clusters seeking operational efficiencies through the integration of thermal and mobility solutions fueled by green hydrogen. These mobility applications include hydrogen refilling stations for forklifts, vans, delivery trucks, and cars. The two companies will primarily target industries with substantial process steam requirements, including pulp and paper, food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, and the oil and gas sector. Exogen provides hydrogen-powered steam plants, pre-assembled in container-sized units.
TotalEnergies and Air Liquide have signed an agreement for the long-term supply of green and low-carbon hydrogen to a TotalEnergies refining and petrochemical platform in Normandy, France. Air Liquide will build and operate the Normand'hy electrolyzer, with a total electrical capacity of 200 MW. TotalEnergies will supply around 700 GWh/year of “renewable and low carbon power” to the Air Liquide electrolyzer for half of its capacity.
TotalEnergies has also launched a call for tenders to supply 500,000 tons per year of green hydrogen by 2030. The French energy company will use it in its six European refineries in Antwerp (Belgium), Leuna (Germany), Zeeland (Netherlands), Normandy, Donges, and Feyzin (France), and its two biorefineries in La Mède and Grandpuits (France).
Everfuel has decided to prioritize green hydrogen production capacity development and reduce refueling network investments by high-grading its existing portfolio of refueling stations and projects. It said the decision follows a realignment of strategy, with a new focus on scaling green hydrogen production “to capture significant value creation opportunities led by recent market developments in Germany and Denmark.”

This increase in projects is likely due to new measures that were recently introduced to help domestic independent power producers build and operate new renewable energy plants.
The country's solar project pipeline recently increased by another 300 MW of capacity, spread across three different projects. In addition, the Bangladeshi cabinet approved two 100 MW projects this week.
Singapore-based Ditrolic SA International Pte and Powernetic Energy secured the permit to deploy one of the two solar plants in Cox’s Bazar, where it already operates a 20 MW solar project, installed back in 2018.
The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) will buy electricity from the facility for a period of 20 years at a rate of $0.0998/kWh. The developer will have to install a 14 km 132 kV double circuit evacuation line to reach the nearest grid substation.   
The second project, which will be located across the Dinajpur and Thakurgaon districts, was secured by a consortium formed by Green Progress Renewable B.V. and IRB Associates.
 The agreed tariff rate for the power plant is also $0.0998/kWh. The two companies will install the facility on a build-own-operate basis.  The developer will have to build 11 km double-circuit power evacuation lines for the electricity to reach the Pirganj grid substation.
State-owned utility Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh (EGCB), meanwhile, has announced plans to set up another 100 MW solar power plant in the Sonagazi sub-district in Feni district. It will feed the economic zones there.
Hero Future Energies Asia will serve as a partner of the EGCB in the new joint venture. The EGCB will provide the required land, while the Singapore-based company will provide the required funds for the construction of the plant.

The new plant will be constructed near the southern village of Ashalim under a public private partnership (PPP) agreement.
The selected developer will be expected to finance, construct, and maintain the facility for a period of 25 years. At the end of that period, the plant is to be given back to the Israeli government.
According to a statement by the head of the Israeli Electricity Authority, Amir Shavit, the new plant is scheduled to be operational by the first quarter of 2027.
“This new PV plant will be added to four other renewable energy projects in the area of Ashalim, that are already up and running,” said Shavit. “We are happy that actors from the local and international markets are already interested in the new tender.”
The Ashalim area currently hosts two PV plants and two CSP plants. The four projects currently inject about 300 MW into the Israeli grid.

Their findings are based on data from seven different field studies and around 550 heat pumps. “This commentary finds that well below 0 C, heat pump efficiency is still significantly higher than fossil fuel and electric resistive heating systems at an appliance level,” the academics said.
Regarding the comfort of using heat pumps, one of the article's authors, Duncan Gibb, told pv magazine that “one of the studies we looked at, in the Northeastern United States, showed that 32 of the 42 owners of a cold-climate heat pump reported being ‘very satisfied' with their heat pump in the past year, 3 ‘satisfied,' and 7 ‘somewhat satisfied.'” He also added that “in a European-focused study, across 670 responses where a heat pump was newly installed, comfort improved in 81% of cases and decreased only in 1%.”
Mild cold climates are defined by the articles as those with average January temperatures above −10 C. For their research, the scientists aggregated field studies from places with such climates, including regions in Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and China.
“When the outside temperature was between 5 C and −10 C, the mean COP across all systems was 2.74 and the median was 2.62, sufficient to meet heating loads at much higher efficiency than fossil heating and electric resistance heat alternatives,” they emphasized. “As most European countries experience milder winters with minimum temperatures above −10 C, our analysis suggests that heat pumps can be successfully installed in these conditions without concerns over performance or the need for backup heating capacity.”
Scientists have also looked at what they defined as extreme cold climates, which are regions with average temperatures below −10 C in the coldest month. For that, they have aggregated data from studies done in the US states of Alaska and Minnesota, as well as commercial studies of Mitsubishi and Toshiba that took place in Finland.
“For climates that experience extremely cold temperatures, performance testing has shown that heat pumps can operate with a COP between 1.5 and 2. Performance data have shown that heat pumps can provide heat at efficiencies up to double that of resistive heating,” they added, emphasizing however that more analysis is required, especially regarding the need for a backup heating system.
“In more extreme climates, cold-climate heat pumps can provide full heating but tend to be much more expensive,” Gibb added. “It is also worth noting that ground-source heat pumps are a highly relevant technology for the coldest climates. In all cases, the heat pump must receive a high-quality design and installation and the building should have reasonable levels of insulation.”
The research's findings were presented in the paper “Coming in from the cold: Heat pump efficiency at low temperatures,” which was recently published in Joule.

“When temperatures are extremely low, most heat pumps rely on energy-intensive, electric resistance ‘strip' heating, which can significantly increase utility costs and strain the electric grid,” said the US-based cooling and heating specialist. “To maximize efficiency and not compromise heating performance, it's often more sustainable to use the furnace as a backup heat source during the coldest days of the year.”
The company said the new air365 Hybrid system uses a Hitachi Mini VRF electric heat pump as its primary heating and cooling source.
“When the air365 Hybrid system is in heating mode, a smart sensor monitors the outdoor temperature,” the company explained. “If it reaches a temperature where the heat pump cannot efficiently meet the indoor heating demand, it automatically switches from the heat pump to the furnace.”
Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning offers three versions of the dual fuel system, weighing from 30.6 kg to 38.1 kg. The smallest system has a rated cooling capacity of 36,000 British thermal units (BTU)/h and a rated heating capacity of 40,000 BTU/h. The largest system has a cooling capacity of 60,000 BTU/h and a heating capacity of 66,000 BTU/h.
“The Mini VRF heat pump offers reliable performance across a wide range of temperatures – as low as -5 C outdoor ambient temperature in cooling mode and as low as -20 C in heating mode,” the manufacturer said. “All models feature night shift, which allows the outdoor unit to operate very quietly, as low as 44 decibels, or 10 decibels less than the average household refrigerator.”
The dual fuel system also features the Affinity Gas Furnace from US manufacturer York, which is a subsidiary of Johnson Controls.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/15/printable-mesoscopic-carbon-perovskite-solar-cell-achieves-17-13-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2023",Printable mesoscopic carbon perovskite solar cell achieves 17.13% efficiency,"Researchers from the East China University of Science and Technology have developed a new manufacturing process to fabricate printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p-MPSCs). They claim that the new technique is able to overcome the typical challenges posed by this cell technology, namely their interfacial passivation and layered assembly.
Mesoscopic PV devices are commonly produced with an absorber layer that can be conducted by a solution-based approach and non-vacuum processing, which makes their production costs relatively lower than those of conventional solar cells. Using organic-inorganic layer structured perovskites has recently enabled scientists across to world to reach efficiencies of over 10%.
“We have replaced expensive metals with carbon materials as counter electrodes and utilized screen printing techniques instead of vapor deposition,” the research's lead author, Wenjun Wu, told pv magazine. “This not only reduces the manufacturing cost but also provides a more convenient coating process.”
The scientists utilized two thiophene-based molecules known as thiophene [3,2-b] thiophene (TT) and 2,5-dibromothiophene [3,2-b] thiophene (TT-2Br) as passivation agents for the grain boundaries in p-MPSCs. “This configuration allowed for the creation of a cross-interface bidentate passivation molecule,” Wu explained. “By exploiting the selective matching of the molecular lattice, we achieved efficient chelation with under-coordinated lead ions, thereby bridging crystal boundaries and improving charge transport.”
The chelation strategy modulated the strain of the crystal lattice of perovskite films, which resulted in an improved power output and voltage for the overall PV device.
In order to address the limitation of non-layered assembly caused by the carbon electrode's full light absorption in p-MPSCs, the scientists employed an artificial reflector device, which they claim allows for dual-sided four-terminal tandem assembly, with TT-2Br serving as the small molecule interfacial passivating agent.

The Chinese group built the cell with a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), an electron transport layer (ETL) based on carbon–titanium dioxide (C/TiO2), a photocatalyst containing mesoporous titanium dioxide (m-TiO2), a zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) interlayer, a carbon electrode, and the perovskite absorber.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 17.48%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.01 V, a short-circuit density of 22.92 mA cm-2, and a fill factor of 75.33%. “Our innovative strategy also significantly improved the bifacial power output (BPO) to 20.44 mW cm-2 and the open-circuit voltage (VOC) to 2.03 V in series-connected devices,” Wu said. “In parallel-connected devices, the BPO increased to 25.84 mW cm-2, and the short-circuit current reached 39.96 mA cm-2.”
The solar cell was described in the study “Lattice‐Selective Cross‐Interface Bidentate Passivation for Efficient Bifacial Tandem Carbon‐based Perovskite Solar Cells – Shao – Solar RRL – Wiley Online Library,” published in RRL Solar. “Our approach opens up new possibilities for high-efficiency passivation and efficient assembly of photovoltaic devices in p-MPSCs, offering potential applications in practical usage,” Wu said.

Toshiba said in a press release that the consortium has already secured a long-term PPA for the project from an unspecified semiconductor manufacturer. It has not indicated the precise location of the planned facility.
“The Solar Fishery Symbiosis project started construction in August this year and is scheduled to supply renewable energy at the end of 2024,” said the Japanese company. “Photon and Ark have plans to construct and supply an additional 360 MW project bringing the total supply capacity of renewable energy to 480 MW.”
Toshiba said the PV system will be installed on the rooftop of the fishery infrastructure, but it did not provide any additional technical details.
Developers of huge solar parks in Taiwan still face resistance from the government, other industrial players, and the farming sector. In Taiwan, just like in neighboring South Korea, land shortages are a big issue for solar deployment, as roughly two-thirds of the island is mountainous.

This increase comes in a week where China’s polysilicon players head to Baotou in Inner Mongolia for a major silicon conference to contemplate their market.
“At present, solar wafer production exceeds polysilicon production,” observed a solar market veteran. In a period when their inventories are seeing reductions, “polysilicon factories will definitely not take the initiative to lower prices,” he explained.

What remains up for debate is whether China polysilicon’s two and a half months of increasing prices is reaching its conclusion. The rate of increase is to a much smaller extent this week than in preceding weeks, observed a different market veteran. “This might be an early sign of leveling off or is even the tipping point” for polysilicon prices.
Some new production capacity has started operations this month, raising the country’s overall rate, one source said. A different source disagreed, for in his view “most capacity has come online already.” Consequently, he does not see much fluctuation in polysilicon prices come the fourth quarter of 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/15/indian-government-says-pv-module-capacity-to-hit-100-gw-by-2026/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2023",Indian government says PV module capacity to hit 100 GW by 2026,"From pv magazine India
“We aim to position India as a leading global supplier of renewable energy equipment,” said MNRE Secretary Bhupinder Singh Bhalla this week in New Delhi.
Bhalla said the government has made significant efforts to build a solar manufacturing ecosystem through the production-linked incentives (PLI) Scheme and other policy measures.
More than 48 GW of new PV manufacturing capacity will be supported through the PLI scheme. These capacities are coming up in different buckets of integration: poly-to-module, ingot-wafers-to-module, and cells+modules. Currently, India has a solar PV module manufacturing capacity of 28 GW and cell capacity of 6 GW per year.
Bhalla said many of the companies are not only producing the quantum allocated [under the PLI Scheme] but setting up much bigger capacities.
“Therefore, we estimate that by 2026, after the PLI scheme is fully implemented and other manufacturing capacities also come up, we should be in a position to have 100 GW of solar PV module manufacturing capacity,” he added.
India is targeting 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based electricity generation capacity by 2030, including around 300 GW from solar. With 71.6 GW of solar capacity installed as of Aug. 31, 2023, the nation will need to add 30 GW to 40 GW per year of solar power capacity to reach the 2030 target.

Talking with pv magazine, one of the scientists behind the research Dr. António Couto said that their “methodology was designed for real-time operation and was validated using historical real data allowing to compare our forecasts with observed results.” One major drawback, he added, is that the projections were based on only one statistical method. “In the future, we will include more methods to choose the best one for each situation,” he said.
The research team used data from three existing wind farms in Portugal – one in the south of the country, a second one in the north and a third one in the west – and assumed their hybridization with either 5 MW or 10 MW of PV power. In their calculations, the total power of the hybrid plant was 20 MW, meaning either 15 MW or 10 MW of wind energy.
Then, the scientists used technical and economic metrics for different hybrid project architectures and scenarios to analyze their impact power forecasts. “Although no consistent and significant differences were observed, the results suggest that using separate forecasts for each technology appears to be the most suitable approach,” the academics added.
This approach yielded the best market value and remuneration for a specific project located in northern Portugal, for which the market value of the wind facility increased by 5.31%. This project also saw its remuneration increase by 26.42% compared to a wind-only site. The project in western Portugal had an increase in market value by 2.24% and experienced a 21.18% higher remuneration. As for the project in the south, these values were at 3.6% and 30.63%, respectively.
“The work uses a forecast methodology based on a sequential forward feature selection algorithm which employs two different objective functions and an artificial neural network approach,” the researchers explained. “The methodology uses as input data from a numerical weather prediction model and iteratively selects meteorological features to achieve the different objective functions implemented, namely minimization of the root mean square error; or maximization of the market remuneration.”
The researchers have also found that, by utilizing the feature selection algorithm, the forecast parameters such as wind gusts, mean sea level pressure gradient, planetary boundary layer height, and wind shear are crucial for hybrid wind-solar projects.
“The findings emphasize the importance of properly selecting the meteorological features and objective functions to calibrate the forecast approach based on user requirements,” the academics concluded.
Their findings are available in the study “Wind power plants hybridized with solar power: A generation forecast perspective,” published in the Journal of Cleaner Production. “We are working on enhancing the methodology by incorporating more advanced statistical techniques comparing to the one presented in the article based on artificial neural networks,” Dr. Couto added. “Preliminary results indicate these research lines can, in several cases, reduce the forecast errors compared to the original methodology.”

Fire incidents caused by DC inverters in rooftop solar installations have increased sharply over the last 12 months in Australia, according to data gathered by the ABC.
In the Northern Territory this year, 11 fires have been caused by DC isolators, compared to just four in 2022. The state of Victoria saw 27 fires caused by isolators in the last financial year, up from 15 the year before. Meanwhile, Queensland had 11 last year, and Western Australia had 14 fire incidents caused by DC isolators. The Australian Capital Territory had at least one incident in the last year, while New South Wales authorities did not respond to requests for data. No data was shown for Tasmania.
Until 2021, Australia mandated DC isolators be part of every system. It was the only country to have such a requirement. After industry experts lobbied against the use of DC isolators, saying they actually made systems more vulnerable to fires and faults, the mandate was finally abandoned in November 2021. Since the requirement for DC isolators was only revoked in practice six months later in mid-2022, most solar installations on Australian rooftops will have DC isolators.
A spokesperson from Energy Safe Victoria told the ABC that a key driver in the increase in fire incidents was a lack of servicing of rooftop solar systems. He said that their research showed that although people with photovoltaic installations on their roofs understand the importance of servicing, they still don’t do it.
While existing laws recommend owners have their PV system inspected regularly and annually for system components like DC isolators, regular inspections are not required under state and territory electrical safety laws.
As pv magazine reported in November 2021, another disadvantage of isolator components is that they can degrade from environmental exposure. This can be due to specific installation methods and product types, increasing the likelihood of water ingress and ultraviolet radiation damage. This was again reflected in the accounts of those experiencing the fires in a report broadcast by the ABC yesterday. In 2021, pv magazine concluded that DC isolators may need to be replaced within the life of the panels of a PV system.
NT Worksafe has now issued a safety warning and advised people to check their solar installations – especially to make sure that DC isolators were not on or near wooden surfaces.

India and Southeast Asia saw above average August irradiance due to the developing 2023 El Niño event. In India, El Niño acts to weaken the Indian Summer Monsoon, while over the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, El Niño acts to suppress cloud events.

Southern India was the standout in terms of unusual irradiance, with 40% more than the August average. This brought the average irradiance up to 6 kWh per day. This is normally a time of lower irradiance due to cloudy conditions during the Indian Summer Monsoon, but the monsoon has been weak this year, with anomalously low wind and rainfall. This is attributed to the developing El Niño event.
The benefits for solar production brought by the weak monsoon were outweighed by the loss of wind and hydroelectric power generation due to the same phenomenon. The overall deficit of renewable energy sources led India to increase its coal generation during August. At the same time, hotter days and the need for more irrigation pumping in dry conditions, increased power demand.  According to Grid India data, there was record power usage of 243.9 GW on 31 August, which exceeded available capacity by 7.3 GW.
This underlines the benefit of good analysis and forecast information for renewable energy resources to enable the management of power networks in the face of weather-sensitive intermittency.
El Niño is generally associated with drier than average rainfall over southeast Asia. Consistent with this, Solcast’s analysis showed that solar production was above normal in Thailand, Cambodia, southern Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia, with areas of solar irradiance up to 130% above the August average.
The cloud associated with typhoons can significantly reduce solar generation potential, besides the more direct impacts these events can have on power generation and distribution infrastructure.  El Niño is typically associated with a shift of Western Pacific typhoon activity to the east away from Asia. Despite this, August saw several impactful typhoon events. Of the 7 typhoons for the month, 4 made landfall.

Over western Japan, Typhoons Khanun and Lan caused widespread cloudiness during 5-10 and 14-16 August, leading to overall irradiance for the month being down 10%. This contrasts with northern Honshu which was missed by the typhoons and experienced 30% more irradiance than usual for this time of year.
These weather systems brought over a dozen deaths, flooding and widespread damage in Japan. During Khanun, 160,000 households lost power, while Lan brought powerlines down and cut power to 100,000 homes.
Long-lived Khanun went on to traverse the Korean peninsula from south to north, which is a typhoon track that hasn’t been observed since records began in 1951. It brought flooding and landslides and left 40,350 people without electricity in South Korea.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.
