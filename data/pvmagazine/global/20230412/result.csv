CSI Solar aims to dramatically increase solar supply chain manufacturing capacity in 2024. By the end of the first quarter of next year, it intends to add capacity for 30 GW of ingots, 15 GW of wafers, 10 GW of cells, and 25 GW of modules.
CSI Solar’s manufacturing capacity expansion from 2023 levels to 2024 targets would see increases in ingot production from 20.4 GW to 50.4 GW, wafers from 35 GW to 50 GW, cells from 50 GW to 60 GW, and modules from 50 to 75 GW. The company’s 2022 capacity was at 20.4 GW of ingots, 20 GW of wafers, 19.8 GW of cells, and 32.2 GW of modules.
“All our new capacity additions for 2023 and 2024 will be in the latest N-type technology, enabling us to better meet strong market demand and accelerate growth,” said Shawn Qu, chairman and CEO of Canadian Solar. “In addition, by increasing the level of vertical integration, we continue to improve our control over technology, raw material sources and costs. These business plans will help us further strengthen our long-term leadership position not just across our end markets but also throughout our supply chain positioning.”
CSI Solar President Yan Zhuang said in March that the subsidiary had “achieved significant growth and profitability improvements throughout 2022.” Zhuang noted that the vertical integration of manufacturing capabilities has allowed the company to increase control over costs.
CSI Solar achieved more than $1 billion in contracted battery storage revenues as of Jan. 31, 2023, he added. Looking ahead, Zhuang expects significant growth driven by the company's solar and battery storage offerings.
Canadian Solar, which just rebranded its global energy subsidiary as Recurrent Energy, is awaiting completion of the China Securities Regulatory Commission registration for CSI Solar's initial public offering. The company is now preparing CSI Solar's IPO, which Qu confirmed had been recently approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission.

Our study brought two layers together,” said Adam Nielander, a researcher at the SLAC-Stanford joint institute. The system mitigates chloride from getting to the anode and oxidizing it. Protons pass through one of the membrane layers to a place where they can be collected and turned into hydrogen gas by interacting with the cathode. The second membrane in the system allows only negative ions, such as chloride, to travel through. One membrane layer contains negative charged groups fixed to the membrane. “The negatively-charged membrane proved to be highly efficient in blocking almost all of the chloride ions in the team’s experiments, and their system operated without generating toxic byproducts like bleach and chlorine,” the SLAC team said. 
The Spanish government awarded Swiss startup Destinus grants for two projects worth a total of €26.7 million ($28.94 million). A €12 million grant will go towards demonstrating flights powered by hydrogen in partnership with Spanish engine manufacturer ITPAero. Additionally, the Spanish Institute for Energy Diversification selected Destinus for a new €14.7 million project to demonstrate the feasibility of supersonic flight with hydrogen. “We are currently testing a gaseous hydrogen post-combustion jet engine (afterburner) while working to advance other engine technologies using cryogenic fuels such as liquid hydrogen,” Destinus said. “These technologies will undergo extensive ground testing over the coming year and be integrated onboard our next supersonic prototype, Destinus-3, in 2024.”
Brooge Energy announced that the Technical Concept Study of its green hydrogen and green ammonia plant in Abu Dhabi conducted by thyssenkrupp Uhde has been completed. The Cayman Islands-based company planned to develop the UAE plant in two phases for a total maximum production capacity of 1,950 mtpd green ammonia. The plant, which uses green hydrogen from solar energy for export purposes, is based on thyssenkrupp nucera’s alkaline water electrolysis and thyssenkrupp Uhde ammonia synthesis technologies. “This analysis explored multiple scenarios to identify optimal plant designs coming along with various supporting documentation dealing with technical and execution concepts on a fully integrated approach,” the company said. 
The United Kingdom and South Korea have agreed to intensify their collaboration on renewable and nuclear energy. Energy Minister Lee Chang-yang said that “Korea has technological prowess in hydrogen applications, having harnessed it to distribute first-rate hydrogen cars” and that “the UK retains leading technological capabilities in solid polymer electrolysis (SPE) and hydrogen production.”
Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein have agreed to strengthen their hydrogen collaboration. “We are focusing on the future in the north,” said Schleswig-Holstein Premier Daniel Günther. The two states will jointly push the interests of northern Germany at the federal level, calling the government to connect Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein at an early stage to the HyPerLink III European hydrogen pipeline network being developed by Gasunie. 
Barclay Pearce Capital has announced a joint mandate with The Ince Group to raise pre-IPO capital for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle leader H2X Global Limited. The agreement confirms H2X's plans to list on the London Stock Exchange in the next 12 months.

The “future-proof” installation has been operational since December. It features two 11 kW Toshiba ESTIA air-to-water heat pumps for space heating, domestic hot water, and cooling during the summer months. The heat pumps use R32 as the refrigerant and have a coefficient of performance (COP) of up to 4.88.
One of the ESTIA systems serves around 90 square meters of underfloor heating in the open-plan kitchen and dining area, while the other provides hot water. It also heats the upstairs radiators and towel rails from a 300-liter water tank. The ESTIA indoor units include a 3 kW backup heater to ensure operation at low ambient air temperatures. Toshiba said that the system delivers hot water at 62 C when outdoor temperatures fall to -25 C.
The heat pumps are powered by a 16 kW rooftop PV system from an undisclosed manufacturer. Excess energy is stored in an 11 kW battery energy storage system. Homeowner and renewables consultant David Meseck said the property is now “energy-neutral” during the summer months, with generated and stored energy offsetting electricity consumed from the grid.
“The whole system has been running since December last year and the way it has transformed the house is fantastic,’’ said Meseck. “It was important to get everything right; the project was sized correctly and the equipment installed properly. Together with the other measures, we now have an efficient, all-electric heating system with the added benefit of cooling in summer, and the annual servicing cost is comparable to boiler cover. As well as helping to future-proof our home and reducing energy costs, the changes have added value to the property.”
The system was installed by Mansfield-based Woburn Mechanical Services.
“This is by some distance the biggest domestic project we have undertaken,” said installer Peter Franks. “The customer knew exactly what he wanted and now has a comprehensive heating and cooling system. The Toshiba equipment is excellent in terms of performance and reliability and comes with a seven-year warranty. We wouldn’t be fitting it if we didn’t have complete confidence in it.’’

EntX, an Adelaide-based tech company, has obtained permission to examine the potential to store hydrogen in underground salt caverns near the town of Elliston, Australia.
EntX’s newly granted Gas Storage Exploration Licence will allow it to start early exploration work on the Polda Basin salt deposits, which have been flagged by Australian Resources Minister Madeleine King as a potential storage location for hydrogen, following research from Geoscience Australia in 2022.
South Australia has the nation’s most up-to-date hydrogen exploration regulations, and that has led to something of a “gold hydrogen” rush in the state. These exploration regulations extend to hydrogen storage in underground salt caverns – a pathway that has a global foothold.
Salt deposits form naturally underground, and are increasingly being used to store hydrogen gas because of their low permeability which can trap the notoriously difficult hydrogen molecule. In the Netherlands and the  United States, massive salt cavern hydrogen storage projects are already underway, with Australia’s Future Fuels Cooperative Research Centre recently determining that Australia could potentially store 310 million tons of hydrogen underground in places such as salt caverns.
EntX, formerly known as PhosEnergy, says it would create the hydrogen storage by drilling into the Polda Basin salt deposit and pouring in freshwater. The Polda Basin’s salt deposits are thought to be 1 km to 2 km underground and extend hundreds of kilometers into the sea.
This storage exploration is part of EntX’s bigger plans to produce hydrogen on the Eyre Peninsula. The Western Eyre Green Hydrogen Project is still in its early stages, and the company is now looking to produce a feasibility study. It is aiming for a final investment decision by 2025.
“Coupling [Western Eyre’s] renewable energy potentials together with the storage of hydrogen, which has always been a challenge in the development of large hydrogen projects, we think we can develop one of the Eyre Peninsula and South Australia’s biggest hydrogen projects,” EntX’s general manager of hydrogen and clean fuels, Glenn Toogood, told the ABC.
Toogood said the salt cavern hydrogen storage component alone would be a AUD 4 billion ($2.67 billion) project.

The solar arrays will supply power to the airport terminal building under a small-scale PPA and to the EV recharging stations operated by Tanegashima Oil on the airport premises. EV owners will buy electricity from the PV systems under a pay-as-you-go billing system.
The companies said EV users will be allowed to choose between renewable and grid electricity when selecting the energy they need. “This will be possible at a cheaper unit price compared to quick charging,” they said.
The demonstrator consists of a PV system with a capacity of 54.7 kW and three 6 kW charging stations. The system will feature Idemitsu's Idepass technology, which enables the selection of power in facilities such as shopping malls, airports, and government buildings. The technology is reportedly able to capture the flow of power generation and consumption in units of one minute.
“This package is scheduled to be rolled out nationwide from 2023,” the companies said. “In addition, we are also considering commercialization such as sales and licensing of the Idepass system.”
Idemitsu noted that it will test the facility at at the Tanegashima Airport over a four-year period. The company is the parent of Japan's Solar Frontier.

GMR Energy is now moving forward with a 1.3 GW portfolio of storage projects across eastern Australia, albeit on a delayed timeline. Its standalone 240 MW/480 MWh Mornington Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), south of Melbourne, follows the company’s pivot from solar to storage around 2021.
The Mornington project has secured development and connection approvals, and GMR Energy CEO Morris Zhou says its partner, Victorian network AusNet, has begun early works and is procuring long-lead items. To this end, Zhou noted that supply chain disruptions have led to a “significant bottleneck in the availability of transformers and other materials required.”
AusNet will build the transmission infrastructure required for the Mornington project, which sits adjacent to AusNet’s existing Tyabb substation. GMR Energy says it is also in “final negotiations” with the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor to build the Mornington battery, although it is not clear which company has won the contact.
The Mornington project will rely on energy arbitrage and supplying frequency and grid control services to generate revenue.
GMR Energy has another five projects in its pipeline, including the 225 MW/450 MWh Gould Creek BESS in South Australia, which also has been given development application approval. Alongside this, the company has lodged development applications for three battery projects in New South Wales, including a 150 MW project in Armidale, a 200 MW project in Tamworth, and a 100 MW project in Lismore – all of which will have two hours of storage duration.
The latest issue of pv magazine takes a look at how the long-established link between solar and cannabis cultivation can help improve margins as medicinal and recreational use of the drug comes out of the weeds. We take a trip Down Under to examine why communities are rebelling against planned renewable energy zones perceived as being railroaded through without sufficient local consultation, and we consider the “solar crime” wave sweeping the UK and Europe.
All of these projects will miss their original completion dates, which the company had scheduled for either this year or last. It is worth noting that the company did seem rather ambitious in its initial timelines, frequently forecasting just a year between public announcements and completion.
In May 2022, the company publicly announced its biggest project to date, the AUD 1.6 billion ($1.06 billion) Merriwa Energy Hub, which includes a 550 MW solar farm and a 400 MW/1,600 MWh battery energy storage system in the Hunter region of New South Wales.

The new design of the Vanguard 2P has been optimized to reduce balance of system costs in harsh soiling conditions and scenarios with higher pile requirements. It purportedly improves on its Vanguard predecessor by using multiple motors on one tracker row. The new solution reportedly withstands higher wind loads and reduces tilt angle misalignment.
“The second generation of Vanguard 2P uses a multi-motor control system to replace the original mechanical method,” Trina Tracker said in a statement. “In the new drive system, the main controller sends commands and the secondary controller receives commands to drive the motors. The self-developed intelligent mechanism enables the synchronization of multiple motors to avoid potential structure failures, which can save time and costs on operations and maintenance.”
The upgraded tracker solution also reportedly improves the structure’s compatibility with larger-sized modules up to 685 W. “All these improvements reduce system costs, lower levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and better fit the most challenging sites,” Trina Tracker said.
Trina Tracker launched the first version of the Vanguard 2P in 2021 and delivered 3 GW of trackers globally by the end of 2022.
“For the past few years, we’ve seen more projects in sites with slope terrains, deserts, and near coastal regions,” said Andrew Gilhooly, Head of Utility, Commercial and Industrial Solutions for Trina Solar Asia Pacific. “This requires solar components to meet more severe quality standards and include more innovative developments to operate under those harsh scenarios.   The second generation of Vanguard 2P aims to successfully solve such challenges,” he concluded.

“We found that, with ATES, a huge amount of energy can be stored, and it can be stored for a long period of time,” said researcher A.T.D Perera. “As a result, the heating and cooling energy demand during extreme hot or cold periods can be met without adding an additional burden on the grid, making urban energy infrastructure more resilient.”
The researchers conducted a simulation with a stochastic optimization model and designed distributed multi-energy systems (DMES) that use ATES as long-term thermal storage. In the proposed system configurations, renewable electricity from wind and solar is used to pump water up from existing underground reservoirs and heat this water at the surface during the summer, or in times with high excess wind power. Then, the same water can be pumped back down to restart the cycle.
“It actually stays fairly hot because the Earth is a pretty good insulator,” said researcher Peter Nico. “So then when you pull it up in the winter, months later, that water’s way hotter than the ambient air and you can use it to heat your buildings. Or vice versa, you can pull up water and let it cool and then you can put it back down and store it until you need cooling during hot summer months. It’s a way of storing energy as temperature underground.”
The academics considered costs, grid-integration levels, and fuel consumption. They then designed a case study of a neighborhood in Chicago featuring 58 two-floor, single-family residences with typical residential heating and cooling systems.
“The results showed that adding ATES to the grid could reduce consumption of petroleum products by up to 40%, though it would cost 15 to 20% more than existing energy storage technologies,” the scientists explained. “But, on the other hand, energy storage technologies are having sharp cost reductions, and after just a few years of developing ATES, we could easily break even.”
The team presented its findings in “Enhancing flexibility for climate change using seasonal energy storage (aquifer thermal energy storage) in distributed energy systems,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.
“ATES will also make the future grid more resilient to outages caused by high power demands during heat waves – which happen quite often these days in many high-population U.S. areas, including Chicago,” they concluded. “Because ATES-driven cooling uses far less electricity than air conditioners, it only needs enough power to pump the water around.”

The China Academy of Metrology and Science has certified the result, which Jolywood said currently represents a world record for an n-type TOPCon cell. It improves upon the company's previous record of 26.1%, which was achieved in November 2022.
The Chinese solar module maker said it achieved the new results due to its independently developed Plasma Oxidation & Plasma Assisted Insitu-doping Deposition (POPAID) technology. POPAID reportedly overcomes issues with similar doped amorphous silicon technology.
“Through continuous technological innovation, Jolywood has successfully developed various cutting-edge technologies such as impurity extraction in silicon wafer body region, a local polysilicon layer, hydrogen content regulation of polysilicon film, new metal damage repair, and ultra-fine gate line printing,” the company said. “By adopting mass production equipment and materials in the production line, Jolywood has achieved a conversion efficiency of 26.7%, pointing out a clear technical direction for the future improvement of the mass production efficiency of the TOPCon cell.”
Jolywood recently commissioned a 1.5GW TOPCon solar cell factory in Taizhou, in China's Zhejiang province.
“With this new manufacturing facility, our TOPCon solar cell production capacity has now reached 3.6GW,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
In October, the company presented a bifacial 700W TOPCon solar module at Intersolar in Munich, Germany. In January, it unveiled a 615W TOPCon product.

They used PEDOT:PSS, a polymer known for its low cost and easy preparation properties, as a hole transport layer in a silicon (Si) heterojunction cell.
To form electrodes without using costly processes like screen printing, electroless plating, and vacuum evaporation, the academics employed a highly conductive silver (Ag) ink agent to coat the semiconductor materials as the electrodes. Their solar cell fabrication process thus comprised only three coating processes: coatings of a PEDOT:PESS layer on a bare Si wafer, of a top Ag electrode on the PEDOT:PSS layer, and of a bottom Ag electrode on the back surface of the Si wafer.
The researchers then explored the optimal process condition and sequence that maximizes the solar cell performance. They found the best results for cells fabricated using first a wet hydrofluoric acid treatment to remove the native oxide layer on the Si surface, then the coating on the back of Si wafer, followed by submerging the Si wafer in deionized water, then coating the PEDOT:PSS layer, and finally coating the top of the wafer.
Following this process, the team said it found “a drastic change in the cell efficiency on the submerging time [of the wafer in deionized water,] where too shallow or intense oxidation of the top Si surface severely degrades the cell.” The scientists found the optimal time period for this process to be one minute and the ideal rotation velocity for the spin coating of PEDOT:PSS to be 5,000 rpm.
A lab-scale 8 mm2 cell fabricated under these conditions showed a conversion efficiency of 10.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.57 V, a short-circuit current density of 33.3 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 0.53.
The academics said the efficiency value is far from the state-of-the-art PEDOT:PSS/Si HJT solar cells “due to severe restriction of the process condition … The low fill factor severely limiting the efficiency is attributed to the relatively high series resistivity.”
Nevertheless, the scientists noted that their fabrication approach “may lead to convenient, low-cost, high-throughput photovoltaic device manufacture, particularly beneficial for the use in the developing countries and educational sites.”
They shared their findings in “An all ambient, room temperature-processed solar cell from a bare silicon wafer,” which was recently published in PNAS Nexus.

The French government will launch two new tenders to allocate 2.3 GW of solar capacity in June, according to two French renewable energy associations – Syndicat des énergies renouvelables (SER) and Enerplan. In a joint statement, the two trade groups said they welcome the government's decision to launch the additional tender round.
The authorities said that the capacity will be split into a 1.5 GW procurement exercise for ground-mounted projects and an 800 MW tender for rooftop installations. The new capacity will compensate for the high failure rate of the previous tender round for large-scale solar plants, which only had seven winners, for an allocated total of 115 MW. The tender concluded with an average final price of €82.23 ($89.73)/MWh.
Earlier tenders, for both ground-mounted and rooftop projects, were also significantly undersubscribed.

Gujarat-based Rayzon Solar has become the first Indian PV manufacturer to expand its module manufacturing operations to the United States. The company said it plans to set up a 500 MW TOPCon module manufacturing facility in Atlanta, Georgia. It said it expects the factory to start production by June 2024.
Rayzon’s entry to the US market comes at a time when Indian PV module exports to other countries, especially the United States, have started to surge. Chirag Nakrani, the director of Rayzon Solar, told pv magazine that the company's decision to enter the US solar market was mostly driven by the country's PV installation potential.
“Several major and small firms have thought about entering the solar market as a result of the sector’s spectacular expansion in India and other nations. The US residential solar PV market size was valued at $14.21 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.3% from 2023 to 2030,” said Nakrani. “The US solar energy market is expected to record a CAGR of 17.32% during the period 2022-27, reaching a solar installed capacity of 270 GW by 2027.”
Rayzon Solar said advancements in PV cell manufacturing technology and high manufacturing efficiency would help it to minimize its manufacturing costs. The company plans to increase its manufacturing capacity in India to 2.5 GW by December with the addition of a 1 GW line equipped to produce mono PERC and TOPCon modules.
