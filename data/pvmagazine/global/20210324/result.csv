Urging the European Parliament and Council of Ministers to adopt suggestions made by the commission–and the EU executive body itself to accelerate plans to invest in European minerals extraction and map the stock of valuable raw materials in the bloc–the EESC cited the solar and energy storage industries as particularly dependent on Chinese imports.
As part of pv magazine’s global UP sustainability initiative, we focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. You can read about lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo and the development of raw material recycling. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
“The EU produces less than 5% of world production of mineral raw materials,” said the EESC, adding China produced 98% of Europe's rare earth elements and 66% of lithium-ion batteries. European member states, by contrast, account for less than 1% each of the world's silicon-based PV products and lithium-ion batteries.
With international body the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicting world metals use could double by 2060, from 8 billion to 20 billion tons, the EESC said Europe imported 75-100% of its metals–depending on type–in 2018.
The EU committee, which comprises representatives of employers, trades unions and other civil bodies, called for urgent investment to identify European mineral sources and fund mining, smelting, transforming and re-purposing of such materials, and cited the example of the €2 billion plan for four big industrial projects to supply 80% of the bloc's lithium needs by 2025.
Whilst the designation of raw materials plans as ‘important projects of common European interest‘ and EU Horizon research funding were mentioned as possible routes, the EESC went further and suggested the deployment of state aid to the sector, as happens elsewhere around the globe, as well as loan guarantees, tax credits and dedicated depreciation rules. In a further remark that could trouble environmentalists, the committee mentioned a need to “help change the perception that extraction industries are not eco-friendly,” with specific reference to deep-sea mining. The statement added: “There are cases in which they are ‘eco-friendly,' thanks to sustainable mining practices.”
On the subject of potentially valuable materials leaving the bloc as part of waste shipments, or lurking in stocks of other components, the EESC said the commission's pledge to map such ‘secondary raw materials' by next year should be brought forward to this year.
It was noted the mining skills abundant in European coal mining areas could be harnessed by new extraction operations as part of a ‘just transition‘ in the bloc and the EESC also mentioned the need to diversify the supply chain by focusing on Africa and South America, as well as Western Balkans reserves closer to home. The committee noted, however: “The fact is, that there are extremely few examples of raw material exports in developing countries triggering sustainable economic and social development from which broad sections of the population would have benefited. Rather, the situation often entails social exploitation and environmental pollution with usually only a few profiteers on the winning side.”
Europe should use its economic and diplomatic heft to persuade companies to pursue more ethical strategies and should also take a firm hand with its foreign and trade policy, said the committee. Ironically, with committee members having called for state aid in the raw materials sector, it went on to mention a “level playing field” in the scramble for raw materials would entail dealing with trade barriers outside the bloc, including the dumping of cheap goods and “public procurement.”

Researchers who observed the process claim to have developed a polymer-based method which counters the related fire hazard inherent in lithium-ion batteries.
Academics from the U.S.' National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL); NASA; University College London; the Faraday Institution, in Didcot, England; the National Physical Laboratory, in London; and the European Synchrotron, in France, drove nails into cylindrical ‘18650 cells' (measuring 18x65mm) of the type commonly used in automotive applications. The researchers were attempting to reproduce the type of mechanical stress electric vehicle (EV) batteries must sustain in crashes.
The nails trigger a short circuit inside the cells, which causes their temperature to rise. To study in greater detail what exactly happens inside a cell when a nail penetrates it, the researchers used a high-speed X-ray camera which captures the event at 2,000 frames per second.
“When a battery does fail, it fails very quickly so it can go from being completely intact to being engulfed in flames and completely destroyed within a couple of seconds,” said Donal Finegan, a staff scientist at NREL whose work involves improving the safety and performance of lithium-ion batteries. “It's very fast and very difficult to understand what happens in that two seconds. But it's also very important to understand exactly what happens, because it is the management of those two seconds that is important for improving the safety of batteries.”
If not moderated, the battery temperature rise of a strike-induced thermal runaway has been shown to go beyond 800 degrees Celsius.
Battery cells contain an aluminum and copper current collector and the research team used a polymer coated with aluminum for the same role and observed their current collector shrank under heat and arrested the flow of electricity immediately. The short circuit heat shrinks the polymer and the reaction creates a physical barrier between nail and negative pole, halting the short-circuit.
During the experiments, all cells without polymer current collectors burst into flames if a nail was driven through them. By contrast, none of the polymer-equipped batteries exhibited that behavior.
“It is very rare that batteries fail catastrophically but when that does happen, it can be very damaging,” said Finegan. “Not only just for the safety and health of people involved, but economically as well, for a company.”
With companies which are integrating battery cells in mind, the NREL pointed to its Battery Failure Databank, which features hundreds of radiography videos and temperature data points generated by hundreds of abuse tests on lithium-ion batteries.
“Small manufacturers don't always have the time and the resources to test batteries in such a rigorous way that we have over the past five to six years,” said Finegan. “They can just, for free, come to the NREL website, download all of this data and make their own assessment of how safe the batteries are that they may or may not choose for their application.”
Researchers in Russia also recently mooted the idea of using polymers to prevent battery fires. Oleg Levin, professor of the department of electrochemistry at St Petersburg University, and colleagues, developed and patented a method that uses a polymer which changes conductivity as a function of heat or voltage. The team dubbed the approach a ‘chemical fuse.'
For the time being, the polymer from the Russian scientists only works for lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries as different cathode compositions work at different voltage levels. For LFP batteries, this is 3.2 V. Rival nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cathodes operate at voltages between 3.7 V and 4.2 V, depending on the type of NMC-cell.

One of the most important ones is the orientation of the tracker.
At latitudes lower than 30 degrees, using bifacial modules on a single-axis tracker will increase energy yields by 45% if the trackers are set up in an east-west orientation, rather than the fixed-tilt north-west setup for bifacial modules. At latitudes above 30 degrees, fixed-tilt bifacial installations tend to outperform tracking mono-facial installations by 5-15% in terms of energy yield. These points are among the key findings of “Global analysis of next-generation utility-scale PV: Tracking bifacial solar farms,” which was recently published in Applied Energy. 
The researchers – from universities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the United States – used multiple irradiance and temperature-dependent energy gain models to determine optimal system parameters for various locations. The team took values of pitch, view factor, and historical weather data for specific areas into account and modeled the energy yield of installations. By modeling different plant setups in various locations, the team was able to reach a number of conclusions regarding each site's optimal plant layout.  
They concluded that fixed-tilt bifacial installations outperform mono-facial single-axis tracking installation by 5- 15% at locations in latitudes higher than 30 degrees. Additionally, north-south tracker orientations in regions where the seasons are more pronounced can improve energy yield during the winter. In contrast, east-west orientations improve energy yield during the summer months. 
The researchers therefore suggest that for installations above 50 degrees latitude, north-south orientations should be used for bifacial trackers. But in regions closer to the equator, 50-degree, east-west-oriented trackers with bifacial modules are the best choice. “Thus, in terms of energy maximization, a bifacial tracking PV would be a worthwhile farm technology (sic) in most locations,” the scientists said.
The team also analyzed which land types promise the highest yields for bifacial tracking installations. To do this, the researchers put land into 17 different categories and analyzed the modeled yearly albedo for each land type. Reportedly, the maximum energy gain can be expected in the “Evergreen and Deciduous Broadleaf Forests” land category. However, the researchers said that such locations should be preserved for the sake of biodiversity. Project developers should therefore eye deserts and savannahs as the next best locations for PV generation. 
Another variable in single-axis tracking is the pitch-over-panel-height ratio – the figure changes with different module and land costs. A pitch-in single-axis tracker solar array describes the spacing between the rows. Leaving cost aside, a project's energy yield increases the higher the pitch gets, as there is less inter-row shading and more unshaded space to improve albedo light collection. But bringing in the module-to-land cost ratio shifts the optimum pitch. For a modeled east-west installation in Washington, D.C., for example, the perfect pitch was between 2 meters and 3 meters for different cost-ratio scenarios.
The researchers aim to use their model to determine the economic viability of bifacial PV for agrivoltaics. They have suggested comparing the cost for vertical and tracking bifacial modules. The model they used in their research can reportedly be extended to model crop-specific tracking algorithms.

Swiss energy provider Axpo is not only installing innovative photovoltaic power plants in the Alps, but is also expanding its large scale storage business.
On Tuesday, the company announced that it will take over the operation of a new 1.25 MW storage facility owned by German power provider Rhiienenergie AG in the canton of Graubünden.
The storage facility will be commissioned on Friday, a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. Axpo wants to use the storage facility to generate primary and secondary balancing energy to stabilize the Swiss power grid. “With the increased expansion of renewable energies and the associated increasing volatility, it is important to stabilize the grids and ensure the security of supply, and this service is, of course, remunerated accordingly,” added the spokesperson.
Axpo has gained a great deal of experience in managing hydropower plants as energy storage and this is expected to be transferred to battery storage. It is also not the first large scale storage system that the energy company has operated. A battery storage system with a capacity of 2 MW had already been installed in Rapperswil-Jona, in the canton of St Gallen, in 2019.
At the end of last year, Axpo announced the construction of a 6.25 MW storage facility in Rathausen/Lucerne. In addition, the largest indoor battery storage facility in the country was put into operation in Arbon in February.
Since 2020, Axpo has also taken over the operation of a 30 MW storage facility in Yllikkälä, Finland. Overall, the company now operates almost 100 MW of battery storage across Europe.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/24/guide-to-help-installers-detect-hidden-costs-in-high-power-modules/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"MARCH 24, 2021",Guide to help installers detect hidden costs in high-power modules,"From pv magazine Spain
A few months ago, in pv magazine, we published a series entitled Light and shade of 500 W-plus solar panels, in which high-power PV modules were analyzed from a technological point of view. Now, the Spanish provider of photovoltaic products Techno Sun has carried out a complete study in which it analyzes the consequences of these large modules for professionals in the sector.
In particular, it has defined how to calculate the additional costs of a high-power solar panel from several points of view, including installation and transport, among others.
The new power ratings in such solar panels entail, at this technological stage, a significant increase in their size that exceeds current standards. In addition, the increase in electrical values means that many inverter manufacturers have to adapt their models or produce new ones. All this represents a qualitative leap that generates consequences for the entire infrastructure currently developed by installers and distributors.
“When we think about the costs associated with solar panels, we have the concept that the larger the panel, the higher the power, and therefore it is more economical,” said Techno Sun. “This idea is erroneous when forgetting other, indirect factors which greatly impact the final purchase and installation price, highlighting that the panels that have the best power/cost ratio are not the larger ones.”
The company also explained that more hidden costs may be found for smaller installations, in particular when the length of the panel exceeds 2.1m. Its experts categorized three predominant sizes of solar panels: ‘Small', with panels less than 1.5m high and featuring 72 cells; ‘medium,' for products around 1.7m high and with 120 cells; and ‘large,' for modules around 2m high and higher (up to 2.4m can already be found) and with a variable number of cells depending on their technology.
Techno Sun states that it is not only the module purchase price that must be taken into account. “In our experience, there are nine key factors that will greatly affect its value and for which we optimize the portfolio of solar panels for our customers,” the company said. These factors are installation; transport; special machinery; mounting structure; inverter compatibility; power rating and surface; maintenance; replacement; and storage.
“When installing a solar panel, you have to consider how simple it could be to install and operate it. A large panel with 1x2m size or more, and an approximate weight of 30kg, makes it difficult for a single person to handle, which means at least two people are needed to deal with their handling,” said Techno Sun.
In addition, depending on accessibility to the installation site, it is likely that a third person, or special machinery, will be needed to lift a larger and heavier panel. However, a panel considered medium-sized by Techno Sun, with a height and weight closer to the current standards, can be handled by a single person in a large part of the process. “This implies that in each installation we are saving the costs of an additional worker, with a considerable reduction in final installation costs,” the report notes. 
Another important factor that must be considered to calculate the cost of a solar panel is its transport, which often goes unnoticed. “From Techno Sun, we warn professionals that transportation is one of the factors that can significantly increase the final price of the products,” it affirmed. It must be taken into account that, if the size of the panel is large, more trips will be necessary to transport all the material necessary to carry out the installation, or a larger vehicle, since it occupies a greater volume of transport.
“For example, if we have a typical installer's van as a reference, with a large panel, there is little space for anything other than the pallet of panels, as no weight can be placed on it to avoid damaging the cells,” the company said. “On the other hand, if it is a medium panel, there would be space for other elements of the installation, such as the inverter, battery, or simply the tools that we are going to use.”
That becomes even clearer if a small truck is taken as a reference. “In this box, we can put up to three pallets of medium panels but it is only possible to fit one of the large panels,” Techno Sun emphasized. “This relationship of three to one can be decisive when calculating the cost of the installation by means of transport and the number of trips to the site.”
Closely related to transport is the use of specialized machinery used both for the loading and unloading of material from the van or truck and for its installation.
“We must bear in mind that the panels of two meters or more come on specialized pallets that are a few centimeters larger,” Techno Sun stated. “For a panel of 2.2m in height, we need pallets of 2.3m long.”
When loading a pallet like this in a van or truck, special machinery will be necessary, since the forks of a mechanical forklift range between 1m and 1.2m. In this way, the panels cannot be loaded horizontally and therefore a conventional forklift cannot be used without the risk of damaging the panels due to the weight in the air or even the pallet falling to the ground. As a consequence, a deep forklift is needed, which results in additional cost in machinery.
In small installations, where the panels have to be raised to roofs or terraces, the smaller products can be transported by a single person, both by stairs or elevators, but in the case of larger ones, special machinery is necessary to be able to upload them to the installation sites, with the large increase in price that this may entail.
The fourth factor is related to the mounting structure used in a PV system. The size of the mounting system is determined by the size of the modules, which means holding a panel measuring 1m and weighing 27kg is not the same as holding one longer than 2m, and of around 30kg.
In current structures, the panels are fastened with two rails and four lateral anchoring points. This is sufficient for a medium-size module as it ensures a good grip, and that the panel will not suffer from movement or twisting when the wind exerts forces on the front and rear sides of the panel. However, in the case of larger panels, if the solar panels are to avoid possible damage and ensure proper operation, they should be installed with three rails instead of two, with an additional rail placed in the center, and with six anchor points to ensure them the stability they need.
Therefore, if a solar panel is installed properly, the costs will be higher, as there are a greater amount of structures to place, with the corresponding increase in time and money invested in materials. If, on the other hand, the installer risks installing a high-power product as if it was a smaller panel, the risk of malfunction or damage increases, resulting in increased costs due to poor installation that impairs the durability of the product.
When choosing an inverter for a solar array, it is necessary to consider that the higher the power of the panels, the fewer inverters will be compatible with them, leading to having to choose large-capacity inverters to install products of more than 500 W.
This is due to the relationship between the maximum output current of the solar panel and the maximum input current of the inverter. Solar panels over 505 W have a maximum output current that can reach above 17 A, while panels between 480 W and 505 W range between 11.5 A and 12 A; modules between 430 W and 480 W are among 10.5 A and 11 A for maximum output current; and those under 430 W are below 10 A.
This means that more than 40% of the inverters on the market are not prepared for panels of more than 505 W and those that are compatible are usually for large scale installations. In turn, around 30% of the inverters on the market do not support panels of more than 450 W.
“Retrofitting installations with higher-power panels will result in the need to also replace the inverter,” Techno Sun highlighted.” At the same time, costs will increase in new installations with high-power panels as installers have to opt for a larger and more expensive inverter with the capacity to withstand their maximum current.”
The common belief is that the larger the size, the greater the power output from an installation, but this assumption is not entirely true, as one of the key factors is space and surface.
Although a large panel has more power than a medium one, the size versatility of the second can allow more panels to be deployed. For every two medium panels, there will only be space for one large one; for three of the first only two of the second; for four, three; for five of one, four of the other; and for six small, only four of the large ones.
That means being able to install more power on the same surface by using smaller panels, in addition to the other advantages that this may entail in possible maintenance and replacements.
Whether a panel needs maintenance or repair, its size is a determining factor for cost.
“The repair and maintenance of larger panels are more complicated, due to the difficulty of handling them, so, as with the installation, it is likely that more personnel will be needed, and therefore more labor costs,” the company said. “We will also lose more total power in the installation if a large panel with more power than a medium one breaks down.”
If it is necessary to replace one solar panel with another, it will be more expensive for the customer to replace a larger and more powerful one than a smaller one. This operation may also include the change of mounting systems. Their cost is higher because the cost of the product itself is higher, as well as its installation and transport.
As with transport, the larger the size, the higher the storage costs. This logistical detail can be crucial as it is not the same to be able to store two pallets in the same place as one.
For a professional, having less stock implies that it will be necessary to place a greater number of orders as stocks are consumed and the greater the number of orders, the higher the costs associated with them.
According to Techno Sun, if an installer is looking for the best final ratio between power and price, opting for medium panels, rather than large panels, should be considered the best option. “Thanks to the cost savings derived from the smaller size, the cost per panel throughout the entire supply and installation chain will be lower and, cumulatively, there will be savings in expenses and a sustainable business margin with the reality of the professional sector,” the company concluded.

The demonstrator devices feature a technology that the researchers refer to as “photonic sunflower.” The tech purportedly maintains a constant angle between the cell and the light source, which maximizes its efficiency as the light moves.
“Such wireless, light-responsive, heliotropic (sun-following) systems could potentially enhance light-to-energy conversion efficiency for the solar power industry,” the researchers said.
The photonic crystals in the cell feature an opal-like film made of silk fibroin, doped with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and an underlying substrate of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is a silicon-based polymer. The crystals were combined with an elastomeric composite that can be manipulated to respond to illumination. Elastomeric materials are able to regain their original shape when a load is removed from the material itself.
“In addition to remarkable flexibility, durability, and optical properties, silk fibroin is unusual in having a negative coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), meaning that it contracts when heated and expands when cooled,” the academics said. “PDMS, in contrast, has a high CTE and expands rapidly when heated.”
They claimed that this combination makes one layer heat up faster than the other, so the material bends as one side expands.
“With our approach, we can pattern these opal-like films at multiple scales to design the way they absorb and reflect light,” said researcher Fiorenzo Omenetto. “When the light moves and the quantity of energy that’s absorbed changes, the material folds and moves differently as a function of its relative position to that light.”
They used a water vapor treatment to design various film patterns and positioned stencils of various sizes on the surface of the films from the silicon monoxide (SIO) side.
“Then, the masked bilayer films were placed above a heated water surface (about 40 C) to directly expose the SIO surface to water vapor for a set of different durations,” the scientists said.
The solar cells have a three-junction tandem structure, an active area of 650 × 650 square micrometers, and are based on indium gallium phosphide (InGaP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and indium gallium arsenide antimony nitride (InGaAsNSb). The scientists described the cells in “Light-activated shape morphing and light-tracking materials using biopolymer-based programmable photonic nanostructures,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.

The Contrasting European Hydrogen Pathways report produced by the Institute of Energy Economics of the University of Cologne and the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, has suggested the willingness to embrace natural gas-fired, ‘blue' hydrogen production demonstrated by the U.K. and the Netherlands may be a wiser approach than the zero-carbon route planned by Germany.
The report's authors explain there is little point ramping up electrolyzer capacity if it would eat into the electricity supply from solar and wind power projects and thus, potentially, drive more fossil fuel power generation. A better alternative, the authors suggested, may be to use natural-gas fired hydrogen–with carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS)–or nuclear electricity, as a bridge solution until sufficient solar and wind generation capacity has been installed to be able to meet both domestic electricity demand and hydrogen production.
Although the U.K. government is yet to publish the hydrogen strategy it has promised this year, the outline of its net zero plans released in December hints at an enthusiasm to embrace blue hydrogen and CCUS, perhaps not surprisingly given the extensive gas operations of domestic energy companies such as Shell and BP.
The most ambitious zero-carbon future energy scenario prepared by U.K. electricity transmission system operator National Grid posited 188 TWh of electrolysis-driven hydrogen in mid century, a figure which would require 100 GW of methane reformation and CCUS capacity, or 60 GW of new wind farms, by that stage.
Germany, by contrast, wants purely green hydrogen–generated from solar and wind power–to power 5 GW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity by 2030, with that ambition to double between 2035 and 2040. However, the German plan hinges on huge volumes of renewable hydrogen imports, chiefly from the solar farms of Southern Europe and offshore wind farms to the north. As the authors of the hydrogen study point out, it is by no means certain the nations Germany wishes to import hydrogen from will have enough clean energy capacity to satisfy their own needs and feed an export industry.
Spain, at least, hopes to be able to deliver, with plans for an €8.9 billion Renewable Hydrogen Roadmap towards 300-600 MW of electrolyzer capacity by 2024 and 4 GW-plus by 2030. The output of such a scale of production would more than meet domestic demand, the authors pointed out, even if Spain's electricity demand trebles by that point. Spain's hydrogen-fueled industries are much smaller than those of regional neighbors such as Germany, France and the Netherlands and the “huge” solar–and wind–potential of the resurgent PV nation means green hydrogen is being considered as a potential seasonal storage solution for clean power.
Elsewhere in potentially renewables-rich Southern Europe, the picture is less clear in Italy. While the authorities have hinted at a 5 GW electrolyzer ambition, by 2030, there are no clear targets in the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) and the green hydrogen industry may have to wait until a net-zero-carbon strategy emerges this year, or even until next year, when the NECP is expected to be revised. Until then, there are just sketchy ambitions about electrolysis driven by clean energy, probably in the sunny south of the nation, although hydrogen-driven PV project announcements have yet to materialize.
Similarly, talk of importing hydrogen from North Africa is little more than an undefined longer-term idea in a nation which has just been forced to elect another new government, this one led by finance technocrat Mario Draghi.
While the Netherlands does not suffer from such political chaos, its politicians are still trying to catch up with EU peers in decarbonizing their power sector. As the hydrogen pathways study states: “Climate policy in the Netherlands will focus initially on the promotion of renewable power generation, so it is less clear the extent to which hydrogen will be a priority for policymakers.”
The Climate Agreement finalized in June 2019 established an electrolyzer capacity target of 800 MW by 2025 and 3-4 GW by 2030 and that national ambition is eclipsed by the 6 GW the northern Netherlands region is gunning for by the latter date–three-quarters of it green and the balance blue.
One key advantage held by the Northern European nation, which will look to northern waters to power any clean electricity, is the unusual dual nature of its natural gas infrastructure. The report explained the nation has two networks, one for the low-calorific gas mostly drawn from the Groningen field and another to transport higher calorific fuel from other gas suppliers. That set-up means one of the two pipelines could be devoted to hydrogen transport to ease the transition from natural gas.
The outlier among the six nations studied is France, thanks to its high dependency on nuclear-powered electricity. The option of using nuclear energy to power hydrogen production at times of low domestic electric demand has enabled policymakers to set the EU's most ambitious electrolyzer target–6.5 GW by 2030.
With the French government having committed to spend €3.5 billion on hydrogen to 2023, and the same amount thereafter to 2030, nuclear-fired ‘purple' hydrogen could be a significant factor in the European industry, at least initially.
With such a varied approach to national hydrogen strategies considered, the authors of the paper found little commonality other than the fact policy support will be crucial to hydrogen production, particularly given the cost premium of the green form of the gas over fossil-fuel-powered, ‘grey' hydrogen. Hydrogen-consuming industry will have to be incentivized away from the conventional form of the energy storage medium and, the authors of the study suggest, it may be wise for governments to already mandate new gas-fired power plants–and even household boilers–should be installed ‘hydrogen ready' for the anticipated transition.

Steven Davies, EMEA market manager, DuPont Teijin Films: Sustainability has increasingly become central to what we do, and this is reflected in our mission to deliver products that generate a positive environmental, social and economic impact to the communities we serve.  Our participation in the solar industry is a very good example of this approach, as at an industry level it is hard to argue with the positive impact that continues to be delivered through the growth of solar, and we believe that Mylar based backsheets deliver what we call “sustainability without compromise”.
In terms of the environmental impact of the product we benefit from a low carbon footprint and clean manufacturing process, which generates no hazardous waste products, and as Mylar is halogen free, there are end-of-life options that are safe and economically viable, such as incineration, pyrolysis or monomer recycling. However, the start and the end-of-life are irrelevant if the backsheet fails to protect the PV module throughout its lifetime, and this is where the rigorous product testing and our track record of over a decade and 50 GW of installed capacity gives us the confidence to make the claim of “sustainability without compromise”.
We actively measure and track our emissions, energy, water usage and waste in order to minimize the environmental impact of the manufacture of our products, and the ISO14001 framework provides us with a robust environmental management system that enables us to achieve our environmental goals. As a business, we are committed to a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2030 based on a 2019 baseline and we are proud to say that our Luxembourg plant operates at zero waste to landfill status. One of the recent developments we are very proud of is the launch of our range of products with post-consumer recycled content which has been processed through our multi-award winning LuxCR monomer recycling process. Not only does this allow us to give another life to post consumer and post-industrial waste, but it also reduces the carbon footprint of our product by up to 1.4kgs of CO2 equivalent for every 1kg of recycled material we process. 
Ultimately the carbon footprint of such different materials is driven by the raw materials used and the production processes required to make the product. Polyester benefits from extremely large scale of production and a very simple, clean and energy efficient production process. The average carbon footprint of Mylar UVHPET products is 3.36 kgCO2eq per kg, and there is a further 10% reduction with our new range of products with recycled content. Based on the data that we have available we estimate that a Mylar based backsheet has an approximately 80% lower carbon footprint than a glass equivalent and 25% lower than a typical fluorinated backsheet. 

We are currently sourcing our post-consumer recycled material from mechanically recovered packaging waste. The key strength of our LuxCR depolymerisation process is that we are able to “upcycle” waste material, rebuilding or even enhancing the mechanical, optical and chemical properties to ensure it is fit for use in demanding applications such as PV backsheets. We are in the process of running proof of principle trials to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of a true closed loop recycling process where PV backsheets can be recovered and used as a raw material for new production, and I hope to be able to give a progress report on this before the end of the year. 
Before marketing the rPET material or even discussing it publicly the first stage was to ensure the film passed our stringent internal trials. Industrial trials with our customers are now underway and our goal is to offer an rPET version across the entire range of Mylar UVHPET products. 
We test all of our backsheet films to recognized UL standards, and also have the ability in house to tailor damp heat testing and UV testing to meet our customers specific requirements. We also believe that sequential testing can be a useful tool to replicate the impact of weathering and we have tested our full range of films using the Marker Sequential Test (MaST) protocol with excellent results in terms of maintaining optical and mechanical properties.    
Although testing in our labs is obviously important, we also feel like there is no substitute for real life data. We have test installations of our films in direct exposure to sunlight in a variety of different climatic conditions with the data showing our products will continue to perform after 25 years of use as a backsheet. As important as all the test data is, ultimately the proof is in the performance of our products and we are proud of our track record of supplying Mylar UVHPET with over 50GW of installed capacity. To put that into context it is over 200 million modules without a single report of a field failure caused by a drop in performance of our products. 
Chemical recycling is a catch all phrase used to distinguish a range of different processes from mechanical recycling, and it is probably more accurate to use the term monomer recycling to describe the process we are researching. Mechanical recycling is the lowest cost and carbon form of recycling plastics, but it does lead to a downward cycle of material properties after every process. With monomer recycling, we break down waste material through a glycolysis process to BHET which is the monomer building block for PET manufacture. This monomer is then repolymerised and converted into film which is indistinguishable from virgin material. The process does not generate any additional chemical waste and the majority of the impurities removed during the process will be suitable for incineration or pyrolysis. 
Bio based backsheets are not currently on our to do list, although we have made films for other applications with 30% bio derived content in the past and we have been involved in early-stage developments to make 100% bio derived PET. My personal view is that industry has to be very careful when making decisions on raw materials, and bio-derived products in particular are one of those areas which sound positive but can have negative impacts in terms of increased carbon footprint, additional water usage and issues around land usage and food security.
pv magazine launched the UP initiative in 2019 to dive deep into the topic of what it meant to be truly sustainable in the solar and storage industries. Each quarter, we highlight a pertinent sustainability issue, like green finance, module recycling, circular manufacturing, and agriPV, among others. Read all about our efforts to date.

We are currently conducting trials to assess different methods of mechanically separating backsheets, and through participation in pv magazine’s UP Initiative I would love to do more in this area with other interested parties from the value chain. I have spent many years in the packaging industry where we have been tackling the difficult question about how to increase recycling rates, and I would say that “design for recycling” is the key to success. I am really encouraged by some of the cross-industry work which is starting to look into the impact product design has on recyclability in the solar industry, and fully support the concept of clear product identification where hazardous materials that can impact the efficiency or safety of recycling processes have to be listed and where possible eliminated from products. 
We are in a fortunate position as we are largely vertically integrated with only a small number of large multi–national raw material suppliers. Increasingly we are engaging with our raw material suppliers and encouraging them to sign up to sustainability rating schemes such as Sedex and EcoVadis. 
In addition to participating in Sedex and EcoVadis, we are involved in the discussions around ecolabeling and similar initiatives and support these industry wide initiatives through our membership with SolarPower Europe. One of the reasons for joining the UP Initiative is to share best practice and ideas across the industry, and I am keen to hear from the wider industry on which of the many sustainability schemes and programs are most relevant to their businesses.  
DuPont Teijin Films are aligned to DuPont’s core values of safety, health and protecting the planet. We are – and have always been – committed to upholding the highest standards for the wellbeing of our employees, our customers and the communities in which we operate. We are driven by innovation that will deliver us to a more sustainable future.  To deliver on our purpose of empowering the world with the essential innovations to thrive, we are constantly working to strengthen our innovation engine, and ensure it’s connected to our customers, as well as applied to meet global needs. To support our innovation platforms, we have developed our 2030 Sustainability Goals – launched in 2019 – that are aligned and draw inspiration from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A few examples include our innovations in clean water to promote health and sanitation; investments in automotive electrification and light weighting to reduce emissions; and our work in 5G high-speed connectivity to enable more connected, sustainable communities.  
I believe the PV industry is at a crossroads when it comes to the sustainability debate, and I think there is a fantastic opportunity for the industry to not only build on our impressive green credentials but also to focus more on areas of concern such as raw material usage, hazardous materials and the lack of recycling infrastructure. I have seen first-hand from the packaging industry that the only way to tackle these kind of challenges is for the entire value chain to work together, both to champion what we are doing well but also to improve those things that we are not.

SunPower and its loan partner, Technology Credit Union (TCU), said they have started offering 15-year 0.99% annual percentage rate loans and 25-year 1.99% loans for Equinox, SunPower’s home solar system, and SunVault, its residential and light commercial storage product.
At $72 a month for a 4 kw Equinox home solar system, the electricity savings could equal the monthly cost of the 25-year loan, said Norm Taffe, executive vice president at SunPower. Under the loan program, a 13 kWh SunVault energy storage system would cost an extra $61 a month, he said. Individual dealer pricing might vary.
The loans are available to applicants who have a FICO score of 640 or higher in 17 states. As SunPower’s loan platform provider, TCU makes money charging interest to borrowers and through fees charged to SunPower. SunPower does not charge additional fees to borrowers.
According to Taffe, the declining cost of solar, the solar investment tax credit, the current low interest rate environment, and demand for solar across the United States prompted SunPower to create the loan offerings.
“The recent blackouts in Texas are making it even more evident to consumers everywhere that solar can help ensure energy continuity,” he said.
With the increased demand for solar nationally, there has also been a shift in how consumers finance their systems. In 2014, about 70% of residential solar installations were financed via leases. Since 2017, however, cash and loan financing have dominated. According to Wood Mackenzie, in the first three quarters of 2020, nearly three-quarters of solar installations were purchased through cash or loans.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/24/australian-developer-to-start-building-250-mw-pumped-hydro-plant/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 24, 2021",Australian developer to start building 250 MW pumped hydro plant,"From pv magazine Australia
Genex said on Wednesday that it will raise AUD 90 million ($68.4 million) through a share offering to institutional investors, while Japanese electric utility J-Power will make a AUD 25 million equity investment to increase its stake in the company.
Genex has also confirmed that the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has conditionally approved up to AUD 47 million in funding for the pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES) facility in northern Queensland, which will be located alongside the existing 50 MW Kidston Solar Farm.
It said that the latest funding announcements, in conjunction with AUD 610 million of previously approved concessional debt finance from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, will provide the AUD 777 million in funding that is required for the construction of the pumped hydro project to commence.
“Securing the balance of funding required to take the Kidston Pumped Storage Hydro Project to financial close is a significant achievement for the company,” said Genex CEO James Harding. “More importantly, to be in a position to finance the project on a 100% equity basis and retain full ownership and control of the asset is a favourable outcome for Genex and its shareholders.”
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said that the project will be the first pumped hydro plant to be built in Australia in almost 40 years. It will also be the first to be used specifically to support the integration of variable renewable energy generation from solar and wind. Miller said the PHES plant will provide reliable, dispatchable and affordable renewable energy to the grid.
“This is a landmark project for all involved and paves the way for renewables to play a larger role in Australia’s electricity grid,” he said. “Genex will be delivering the first pumped hydro project in Australia since 1984 and the first to be used solely for energy storage and generation rather than water management.”
Part of Genex’s renewable energy hub is located at what was once Australia’s largest gold mine. The project is a 250 MW/ 2,000 MWh PHES, equivalent to eight hours of energy storage.
Two existing mining pits at the former gold mine site will serve as the upper and lower reservoirs for the PHES to minimise construction time and costs. During peak power demand periods, water will be released from the upper to the lower reservoir, passing through reversible turbines. During off-peak periods and when the sun is abundant, water will be pumped back from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir using electricity imported from the National Electricity Market (NEM).
A 187-km transmission line will be needed to connect the Kidston Renewable Energy Hub to the NEM. This transmission line is also expected to facilitate the connection of further renewable generation projects in the region.
“Large-scale storage will play a key role in ensuring security and reliability of Australia’s electricity system as we transition to renewables,” Miller said. “Pumped hydro is expected to be a key technology enabling us to store abundant solar and wind energy when it is available and dispatch this energy back into the grid during the evening and other times of peak demand, so it is imperative these projects get underway.”
Sydney-based Genex said that financial close is expected to occur in mid-May, with construction activities to commence in late April. Construction is expected to be completed by 2024.
EnergyAustralia will be the project offtake partner for a period of up to 30 years. A joint venture of John Holland and McDonnell Dowell is the EPC contractor.
“Having championed this project from conception, and having supported pumped hydro feasibility studies across Australia, we are very excited to see this project reach financial close and commence construction,” Miller said.
