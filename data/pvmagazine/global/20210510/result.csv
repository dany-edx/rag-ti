Tesla watchers report that the company has shifted to cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for its 3 MWh Megapack energy storage product. The shift to LFP cathode batteries could cut costs and ease demand for supply-constrained nickel-based battery production capacity.
LFP batteries are typically less expensive to produce, but they also are less energy-dense than the nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cells used by Tesla in its electric vehicles.
The Megapack has a maximum energy capacity of 3 MWh per unit and is claimed to require 40% less space and fewer parts than other systems on the market. Reports said that with LFP batteries, the Megapack could see lower production costs, which could be passed on to customers of grid-scale storage technology.
Last year, the EV car manufacturer deployed 3 GWh of storage in a single year for the first time. That was an 83% increase against 2019. The company attributed much of this growth to the popularity of its utility-scale storage product, Megapack.

A joint press release issued today by the three finance bodies behind the project stated the EIB will provide a loan of €43.7 million for the facility, with loans of €21.8 million each being supplied by London-based international development entity the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and by the Proparco, private-sector arm of French development financier Agence Française de Développement. Rounding up of the exact figures results in a total loan package of €87.4 million.
The solar field is being described as one of the first private-sector renewable energy facilities in Uzbekistan thanks to the involvement of French energy company Total as its developer, via the Tutly Solar LLC unit of its Total Eren clean energy operation.
Total will sell the energy generated by the field to project operator National Electric Networks of Uzbekistan under a 25-year power purchase agreement.
pv magazine has asked the EBRD when the solar project is expected to come online.
The government of Uzbekistan is aiming for 8 GW of solar and wind power generation capacity this decade. In its latest set of figures, the International Renewable Energy Agency estimated the nation had 8.33 MW of solar and wind capacity at the end of 2020.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/10/new-accountant-to-probe-whether-gcl-project-payment-was-between-related-parties/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",MAX HALL,"MAY 10, 2021",New accountant to probe whether GCL project payment was between ‘related parties’,"GCL-Poly says the accountant it has appointed to investigate a pre-payment made in 2019 for a silicon project which never took shape will examine whether the money passed between related parties.
The Chinese polysilicon manufacturer has been unable to publish its 2020 accounts over the matter and trading in its shares has been suspended since the end of March as a result.
Auditor Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu questioned the commercial rationale behind the payment of RMB510 million ($79.5 million) to a contractor in September 2019 for a silicon manufacturing project which was never subsequently constructed. Although GCL said it had received a refund of RMB495 million ($77.2 million) – minus the contractor's expenses – last month, Deloitte refused to sign off the accounts and recommended the appointment of an independent accountant to investigate the matter.
After starting an internal investigation, GCL on Friday announced a Shanghai-based accounting and advisory firm which is a member of international accountancy body Mazars would conduct a forensic audit of the matter. In addition to questioning the commercial reasoning behind the pre-payment, GCL said the firm would also probe “whether the parties to the EPC contract were related parties.”
The solar manufacturer, which has been in cross-default since the end of 2020 after non-payment of a $500 million senior note at the end of January, announced its latest solar project sell-off on Friday.
GCL, which last year shed its crown of being China's largest solar plant owner to Chint Group, announced the sale of an 86 MW solar farm to the SPIC Chongqing Electric Power Co Ltd unit of utility State Power Investment Corp for a net RMB252 million.
The sale will book a gain of RMB51 million despite RMB4.6 million ($717,000) worth of “engineering and compliance defects” and will remove another RMB431 million of liabilities from the heavily-indebted accounts of GCL's New Energy solar project development operation.
The solar project in question is yet to be added to the national Renewable Energy Tariff Subsidy List and, if it fails to be listed this year, its state-owned purchaser will have the right to insist GCL repurchase the facility.
According to Chint's annual report, the power transmission and distribution equipment provider held 5.7 GW of solar farms in China at the end of 2020. GCL's estate had fallen to around 4.83 GW by that point, according to its stock market announcements, and the sell-off has continued into this year as the company awaits approval of a senior note swap plan to reorganize its problematic $500 million debt.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/10/perovskites-stick-together-for-better-performance/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MAY 10, 2021",Perovskites stick together for better performance,"Having proved their potential for high efficiency and low-cost manufacturing, perovskite solar cells have caught the eye of manufacturers, and already made significant progress toward commercialization and large-scale production.
There is still a lot of caution though regarding stability and the tendency to quickly lose initial performance when exposed to moisture and other conditions they would certainly face in the field. Scientists have suggested a wealth of different approaches to this issue. And while it’s not clear which of these might be picked up in industrial production, there is general consensus that the problem can be solved.
Scientists led by Brown University in the U.S. demonstrated another approach to improving perovskite solar cell stability, working with a “molecular glue” added during processing that served to dramatically improve adhesion between the light-absorbing perovskite layer and the electron transport layer. “A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and we identified this interface as the weakest part of the whole stack, where failure is most likely,” explained Nitin Padture, who directs the Institute for Molecular and Nanoscale Innovation at Brown. “If we can strengthen that, then we can start making real improvements in reliability.”
With this in mind, the group began experimenting with a group of materials called self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). “This is a large class of compounds,” Padture continued. “When you deposit these on a surface, the molecules assemble themselves in a single layer and stand up like short hairs. By using the right formulation, you can form strong bonds between these compounds and all kinds of different surfaces.”
Settling on a SAM made up of silicon and iodine atoms, and applying this to perovskite solar cells using a dip-coating process conducted at room temperature, the group was able to demonstrate an impressive effect on the cell structure. “When we introduced the SAMs to the interface, we found that it increases the fracture toughness of the interface by about 50%, meaning that any cracks that form at the interface tend not to propagate very far,” said Padture. “So in effect, the SAMs become a kind of molecular glue that holds the two layers together.”
In testing, solar cells treated with the SAM achieved 21.4% efficiency and retained 80% of this after 4000 hours under 1-sun illumination and continuous maximum power point tracking. A set of control cells produced without the SAM treatment reached 20.2% efficiency and fell to 80% of the initial value after around 700 hours in the same test conditions. The experiments are described in full in the paper Interfacial toughening with self-assembled monolayers enhances perovskite solar cell reliability, published in Science.
“One of the other things we did, which people don't normally do, is we broke open the cells after testing,” said Zhenghong Dai, a Phd student at Brown who led the research. “In the control cells without the SAMs, we saw all kinds of damage such as voids and cracks. But with the SAMs, the toughened interfaces looked really good. It was a dramatic improvement that really kind of shocked us.”
The group now plans to extend its work to strengthening the bonds between all of the other layers in the perovskite cell stacks, as well improving the mechanical strength of the individual layers themselves. And they recently received $1.5 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy to pursue this. “”This is the kind of research that's required in order to make cells that are inexpensive, efficient and perform well for decades,” concluded Padture.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/10/indias-sterling-and-wilson-solar-establishes-eu-headquarters-in-spain/,"SPONSORED,EUROPE,SPAIN,WESTERN EUROPE",,"MAY 10, 2021",India’s Sterling and Wilson Solar establishes EU headquarters in Spain,"With a focus on serving European PV markets and projects best suited to benefit from its vast experience, multinational Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) firm Sterling and Wilson Solar Limited (SWSL) has opened a new office in Seville, Spain.
With this new office, SWSL brings to the European market an EPC portfolio of over 250 projects totaling 10.8 GW of capacity, as well as an operations and maintenance (O&M) portfolio of 8.1 GW. The multinational company employs over 1,300 professionals and is able to serve markets eager to deploy solar with cost-competitive design and engineering experts based in India.
Market opportunities abound in Europe, driven in part by favorable economics and in part by accelerating efforts to decarbonize the continent’s electric power supply chain and address threats posed by climate change.
The European market has steadily improved from where it was a decade ago. Back then, high duties on PV modules offered a cloudy future at best for many solar projects. Projects typically required some form of government subsidy in order to be financially viable.
SWSL is no stranger to Europe, or to Spain. The firm already had a presence in Vigo, Spain, where it managed Latin American solar projects. With that initial foray, the company learned firsthand how Spain’s engineering workforce is virtually unmatched in Europe, making it an ideal location to base its regional operations.
No less important, Spain offers a stable and well-integrated supply chain for solar equipment with access not only to Chinese manufacturers, but European suppliers as well. And, as a multinational company, SWSL found many of its peers already doing business in Spain, allowing the company to leverage important existing relationships and forge new synergies.
Between 2017-2018, the cost of solar modules began to drop dramatically, and the European market showed encouraging signs of improvement. SWSL monitored those improving metrics but was intent on establishing its presence in the Latin American and Australian EPC markets, where, by the end of 2020, the company had secured around 700 MW and 1,100 MW of solar EPC work, respectively. Prudent management led the company to be cautious about expanding too quickly into a market as important as Europe.
Then, as it did with virtually every other international firm, the global Covid-19 pandemic forced a pause in SWSL’s European expansion plans. But as 2020 drew to a close, the company concluded that the time was ripe for it to open its full-service European office.
The company sees growth potential in Europe both for utility-scale projects (including storage solutions) as well as for commercial and industrial solar deployment. It sees on the order of 7-8 GW of capacity additions each year, growing to anywhere from 20-25 GW by mid-decade. Its approach to the market is to be highly strategic in securing new business.
From its base in Spain, SWSL plans to target opportunities across the Iberian Peninsula, as well as in Italy, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria, and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. For example, in 2019 the company won a competitive bid for a 250 MW solar project in the Ulcinj solar site in Montenegro in the Balkans. The pandemic put work on hold, but the project is expected to be built by the end of this year.
In pursuing solar EPC work, the company targets a sizable number of projects that are not only commercially viable but also open up multiple opportunities in markets that may not grab all the headlines. Northern European markets are great, but SWSL intends to find growth opportunities in markets that typically do not attract the same amount of attention.
The company recognizes that European markets are made up of two principal segments. The first includes the full range of turnkey projects, which often are built with non-recourse financing.  The second, includes a significant number of projects that are financed on the balance sheet and that need the expertise of a well-established EPC firm.
It’s here that an EPC firm’s bankability becomes a key criterion for developers to consider. Multiple European banks have already rated SWSL as a highly bankable EPC. To be sure, the company has established strong relationships with European banks for projects in Africa and in Latin America. SWSL’s established bankability is a major strength as it pursues projects across its target markets.
In its plans for the European market, SWSL also intends to establish a presence as a solar developer and the company is currently evaluating a number of greenfield opportunities. As those ventures reach maturity, it will transfer the assets to investors and secure the EPC business to construct and commission the projects, playing to the company’s core strength. Currently, the company is pursuing almost a gigawatt of development bookings for 2021; those projects could enter service by mid-decade.
In addition to its roles as developer, EPC contractor, and owner, SWSL also plans to enter Europe’s third-party project O&M service market. Here, the company has already executed O&M contracts for 8 GW of projects in multiple markets including Latin America and Australia and has secured long-term O&M contracts of up to 30 years with European developers in other geographies.
Sterling and Wilson Solar Limited is well positioned to support the European solar market across the value chain and deliver superior EPC solutions to markets and projects that otherwise might not have expected to benefit from such premium service. The firm’s existing relationships with developers and financial institutions alike offer the company unmatched insight into specific engineering challenges and opportunities, not only in the Iberian Peninsula, but across the continent as a whole.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/10/the-best-worlds-regions-for-compressed-air-storage/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 10, 2021",The best world regions for compressed air storage,"Storing intermittently generated renewable energy with compressed air energy storage (CAES) seems to have become more than a feasible solution in recent months, as several large-scale projects have been announced in the United States, Israel and Canada.
According to Christian Breyer, professor of solar economy at the Lappeenranta University of Technology in Finland, the potential for this kind of storage technology is scattered all around the world, and ultimately dependent on underground geological conditions. “All major regions in the world have access to respective underground geological resources, but there are also vast regions without a suitable potential, at least according to our analysis,” he told pv magazine, referring to a study he conducted with fellow researcher Arman Aghahosseini.
Although cost reduction for this technology may be more limited than for other storage systems – as it is site-specific, like pumped hydro energy storage, which has, also, a rather limited cost reduction potential – CAES may become an interesting option for all those countries and regions that have a small interconnection with their neighbors. “The more nationally a highly renewable energy system is designed, the more relevant CAES becomes,” Breyer further explained. “We have regularly noticed in our results that strong cross-border grid integration reduces the need for CAES, and vice versa.”
He also specified that building, regularly, such plants around the world would create a specialized industry with experience aggregation which leads to optimized project planning, and also some economies of scale in engineering, permitting, site selection, and technical components. According to Breyer, although CAES may not be considered an optimal solution for daily storage or seasonal storage, it will be probably become a mainstream solution for all those markets where weekly storage is strongly needed.
“The main reasons for the slow progress of CAES, that have been discussed in the literature, are relatively low efficiency and high fuel consumption of the conventional CAES plants, as well as the need to identify suitable geographic features for the formation and locations,” Aghahosseini told pv magazine. “There have been some efforts to increase the efficiency of such storage and as a result, second generation of CAES has emerged. In addition, adiabatic CAES (A-CAES) can be operated without fossil fuels' requirement for the combustion process. This complements CO2-neutral generation of electricity from renewable energy, in particular solar PV and wind energy, when needed.”
In their paper, Breyer and Aghahosseini had assessed the CAES potential of 145 countries divided into nine major regions. Their analysis considered geological resource potential, including formations such as salt deposits, porous rock and hard rock. They found that North America and sub-Saharan Africa have the largest portion of suitable areas for this kind of storage technology. “This can be explained by the fact that North America has huge salt deposits and favorable geology for CAES,” the study notes. “Likewise, sub-Saharan Africa has large aquifer reservoirs and salt deposits which match with appropriate geological formations.” Western Canada was identified as the region with the largest potential in the world.
Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) area, which includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, are pointed out as the regions with the least potential for CAES.
Crucial for the identification of an ideal location for large scale CAES projects, should be the proximity to renewable energy infrastructure and the electric grid. “Less than 5% of the global geological resource potential of about 6,574 TW of electricity storage, may be necessary in a 100% renewable energy scenario for the very unrealistic case that all electric storage would have to be provided by CAES,” the two researchers concluded.

SPIC, through its 70% holding in the newly-established Shanghai Yuanye New Energy joint venture (JV) set up with Jolywood, has awarded an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) deal to install 7.2 GW of residential solar panels over five years.
Under the terms of the arrangement, Jolywood will fit 1.2 GW of household solar within a year, with a further 1.5 GW to follow annually for the remainder of the contract.
Jolywood agreed a first-year price of RMB3.50 per Watt ($0.54) for the arrays, with the value for subsequent periods to be set annually. Under those, first-year terms the total value of the deal would be RMB25.2 billion ($3.92 billion). Jolywood, which produces tunnel-oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) modules, had a market value of RMB6.8 billion ($1.06 billion) at the end of April and the RMB4.2 billion ($654 million) guaranteed from the first 12 months of the EPC contract alone will represent 83% of the revenue generated by the manufacturer last year.
However, solar panel manufacturing input costs are rising and the state-owned electric company is likely to expect installation costs to fall in subsequent contract years, putting further pressure on the manufacturer's margins.
Factory explosions and flooding last year led to a shortage of polysilicon which saw the price of the solar panel raw material more than double in the second half. A lack of chips during the first three months of this year has driven panel prices up further and shortages of EVA backsheets, cables and glass have further pressured input costs.
The contract also stipulates a performance guarantee by Jolywood subsidiary Zhonglai Minsheng amounting to 10% of its shares in the Shanghai Yuanye New Energy JV plus 5% of the total contract value.
The deal was entered into by Jolywood subsidiaries Zhonglai Minsheng and Zhonglai Energy Engineering, with the JV. News of the contract saw Jolywood's share price spike 17.34% before settling 13.4% up in the following day's trading.
The extensive contract would account for a significant chunk of China's residential PV market, which saw 5.3 GW of household solar added in 2019 and 10.1 GW last year and which is expected to continue to grow this year, to an estimated 15 GW.
This copy was amended on 10/05/21 to reflect Jolywood and SPIC have agreed a price of RMB3.50/W for the first year of the contract and to add in details about the effect of the contract on Jolywood's share price.

Around 101.4 MW of this new capacity was registered in April alone, and brought the country's cumulative installed solar power capacity to 7,065.4 MW. “Most of this capacity comes from rooftop PV and around 146 MW are from the YEKA tenders,” Eren Engur, a board member of the energy storage committee at the Turkish PV association, Günder, told pv magazine.
In 2020, the newly installed PV capacity had reached 672 MW while in 2019, new PV additions had totaled 932 MW.
The Turkish PV market is currently being driven by self-consumption and net-metered rooftop PV. Turkey introduced net metering in May 2020 and the market has responded by starting to shift away from the megawatt-sized projects which have traditionally dominated.
The Solar Energy Roadmap report published by the Turkish PV association in 2019 predicted the nation could install 38 GW of solar by 2030. A separate study, published by the Istanbul-based Shura Energy Transition Center, in May 2018, had predicted solar could pass 20 GW by 2026.

The academics stated that organic PV technology is particularly suitable for this kind of application due to its low cost and flexibility, which enables its integration into internet-connected devices. “Powering a large portion of connected mobile Internet-of-Thing (IoT) devices using flexible OPVs is an attractive solution to overcome the burden of having to charge devices regularly,” they also explained.
The PV device was built with an inverted architecture based on metal oxide-based charge-selective transport layers and metal electrodes made of gold and silver, which the British group said improves the device's performance stability. It consists of a 4×2.5mm photoactive layer fabricated with a bulk heterojunction of a polymer donor and fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors.
“Under 1 Sun intensity (100 mW/cm2), these solar cells demonstrate a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.8%, and under artificial indoor low-light-intensity illumination (0.3–6 mW/cm2), the PCE is 14%,” the researchers specified.
Four cells of this kind were assembled with a laser-based point-to-point OWC system to build a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system consisting of four laser diodes. The PV devices have separate contacts and the output current from each of them is individually accessible, which means the cells can be used as separate receivers or their signals be combined so that the whole system acts as one receiver.
“The transmitted power of each laser is 56.2 mW,” they further explained. “A data rate of 147.5 Mb/s is achieved with a single-input single-output (SISO) OPV-based system, which is the highest reported data rate with OPVs to the best of the authors’ knowledge. […] These values are further increased to 221 Mb/s or 363 Mb/s and 6.8 mW or 10.9 mW of harvested energy by implementing a 2-by-2 or 4-by-4 OPV-based MIMO system, respectively, for the first time.”
The proposed system configuration, the scientists stated, is designed for a system with four light transmitters and four OPV cells integrated into a single panel, The methodology they applied, however, is claimed to be generally applicable. “As a result, by using the proposed method, it is possible to trade the physical size of the system for both harvested energy and data rate,” they added.
The system is presented in the paper Organic photovoltaics for simultaneous energy harvesting and high-speed MIMO optical wireless communications, published in Light | Science & Applications.

Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. (MSEDCL) has issued a tender to procure up to 500 MW of solar power from grid-connected PV projects through competitive bidding. 
The bidders selected by MSEDCL must have existing solar power plants or be able to set up new capacity to supply the power. In case of newly proposed plants, the solar power generators will be responsible for design, financing, land procurement, engineering, construction, operations and maintenance.
For new projects, the electricity distribution companies will enter into power purchase agreements with the successful bidders for periods of 25 years from the scheduled commercial operation date.
Separately, New Delhi-based Rising Sun Energy (RSE), a unit of Malaysia-based Yinson, is setting up a 190 MW (AC)/285 MWp (DC) grid-connected solar project at the Nokh Solar Park in the Indian state of Rajasthan.
The developer recently opened bidding for EPC service providers to set up the project on a turnkey basis. The project will be developed under the “Open” category, and will allow the use of solar cells and modules of any origin.
Rising Sun Energy has received a letter of award from state-owned producer NTPC Ltd. for the development and operation of the project. The developer will supply the electricity to NTPC at a fixed tariff rate of INR 2.25 (USD 0.031)/kWh under a 25-year PPA. The plant is scheduled to become operational by April 2022. 
The Nokh Solar Park is about 30 kilometers from the 140 MW Rising Bhadla 1 and 2 solar plants, which are owned and operated by Rising Sun Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/10/solar-101-how-to-evaluate-solar-contractors-for-rooftop-projects/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MAY 10, 2021",Solar 101: How to evaluate solar contractors for rooftop projects,"From pv magazine USA
The first articles in our Solar 101 series, (Is my roof ready for solar?) and (Attaching your solar system to your roof) examined how the age and physical characteristics of a roof affect the design and payback of a prospective solar system. We also discussed the design constraints resulting from wind, dirt, and precipitation. And, in Working the angles to maximize your solar system’s output, we looked at the relationship between a panel’s latitude, pitch and azimuth to its solar electricity output.
Now, we’ll look at how to find a solid solar contractor to build your solar power system.
A well-designed solar system should last 20 or 30 years, or longer. The mounting hardware, which attaches directly to your home, will typically require drilling holes in your roof. But don’t fear. This guide for choosing the right contractor should help ease your concerns.
Experience counts
One rule of thumb: Find someone experienced. Installing solar panels, like anything else, involves doing a set of similar actions over and over. Experience represents more than just the labor of attaching solar panels and the required electrical gear. For instance, experience usually indicates:
Recent research by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Berkeley Lab suggests that more experienced contractors offer better pricing.  This chart from their annual Tracking the Sun report doesn’t explicitly break down experience, but it does show how pricing can vary by contractor.
Experienced solar contractors have a truck filled with various odds and ends leftover from prior solar jobs. These little components often mean the difference between finishing a project in a day or two, versus two or three days with several trips to the local hardware store mixed in.
The question then becomes “how do we find an experienced solar contractor?”
Local connections
First off, ask your friends. And as strange as it may sound, knock on the door of someone who has already installed solar power and ask them. These folks have real experience with a contractor, and can give you a tip or two as you ask questions of prospective contractors.
If you know contractors who have done good work for you already, ask them who they would hire to install a solar system on their roof. Roofing and electrical contractors often have pre-existing relationships with solar contractors because their businesses have a lot of overlap. Your HVAC contractor may also have a good working relationship with a solar contractor. And finally, local professional engineers (specifically structural and electrical) will have knowledge of the local solar contractors because they have to sign off on solar design drawings.
Another technique is to reach out to your local town hall to learn who the local permit office likes to deal with. Be sure to ask which solar contractors always seem to submit the right paperwork. This question may be more important than it appears, because paperwork is a huge part of a solar installation.
And one last technique: Call your local contractor supply houses. Again, the supply houses have relationships with contractors that buy the most hardware from them. For this call, come prepared with a few key questions: Who pays their bills on time, who’s been in business the longest, and who is most organized?
Cold calling
One way to vet a contractor is to simply call them and see how they follow up with you. Their follow-up will give you an idea about the quality of service you might receive later in the process.  Be sure to call an actual local contractor, and not a sales organization that will simply hand the lead off to a contractor.
A few items to consider when the contractor representative shows up:
After reaching out to locals and others in the know, the next place to go is Google. But beware: Companies – and especially sales organizations – specialize in placing themselves high up the Google search results.
Contractors, on the other hand, specialize in building things. Many good builders lack grammar and/or web development skills. Look the other way and evaluate them on attributes that matter: reliability, knowledge, experience, and work product.
The one place that this author regularly sends people is SolarPowerWorldOnline’s Top 500 list. You’ve got to be smart, however, about using this list.
First, make sure you choose your own state because the default list is national. Second, recognize that companies pay a fee to get on the list. And third, consider that the companies near the top of the list are likely the largest national companies.
Second path
A second path to follow without cold calling is to use EnergySage. Contractors submit their profile to the company, must have at least 10 installations with positive reviews, and are regularly re-vetted.
Here’s the key value kicker from EnergySage: After you submit your address, you will get a few quotes from contractors who  know very well that they are competing with at least two or three other contractors. This will likely force these contractors to work their numbers to be competitive.
Contractors pay commissions to EnergySage – about $1,000 if the customer ends up installing. However, that commission is comparable to what a door-to-door salesperson might make.
Of course, you should also consider the largest national companies, with Sunrun, Sunnova, and Tesla being the big three these days. These companies all have unique offerings, and also some similar products, so research each of them and their offerings to know which might best fit your needs.
Sunrun and Sunnova are best known for their solar lease products. In essence, you rent your rooftop to them in exchange for a “free” solar power system. Tesla’s main business is to sell you a system that you fully own, whether it be standard solar panels or their new Solar Glass roof product. Both Sunrun and Sunnova will also sell, but their system costs typically don’t compete with Tesla’s pricing model.
The compromise: You will likely get the cheapest price for residential solar hardware from Tesla, but there also will probably be less personal interaction and system optimization.
A small local company might not be able to provide the lowest hardware prices, but will likely put more effort into customizing a design to fit your specific application. And always keep one eye open. Some mid-sized companies will quote twice as much as their competitors.

Agilitas Energy is starting pre-construction work on what is expected to be the largest standalone battery energy storage project in Rhode Island – a 3 MW/9 MWh lithium-ion system in Pascoag.
The project will provide peak shaving services to the Pascoag Utility District and ancillary services to ISO-New England. It is the first battery energy storage system to be built by Agilitas Energy in Rhode Island. It is scheduled to go into service by the second quarter of 2022.
The project is being constructed to support Governor Gina Raimondo’s 2020 executive order committing the state to meeting all of its electricity demand with renewables and non-fossil fuel resources by 2030. In addition to supporting the state’s renewable goals, the project is also being constructed to avoid the costly reconstruction of existing transmission lines in the area.
With this project, Agilitas Energy is now constructing more than 40 MW of solar and over 70 MWh of energy storage projects in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York.

Engineering groundwork for the AUD 20.3 million ($15.9 million) Yadlamalka vanadium flow battery near Hawker, South Australia, is now moving toward completion. With production of the 41 Invinity VS3 battery modules now ramping up for delivery later this year, pv magazine Australia recently caught up with Matt Harper, chief commercial officer of Invinity Energy Systems, to talk tech.
Invinity was formed when two vanadium redox flow battery companies – U.K.-based RedT and North American innovators Avalon Battery – merged in April 2020. At 2 MW/8MWh, Yadlamalka Energy’s storage solution is Invinity’s largest solar-powered vanadium flow battery to be built to date. It is co-located with a 6 MW solar PV array on land held by the Yadlamalka Land Trust, adjacent to Yadlamalka Station.
Yadlamalka, a 1,000-square-kilometer sheep and cattle farm 60 kilometers north of Port Augusta, is the family property of Andrew Dorman, a former senior director of McKinsey & Company and an entrepreneur with a passion for investing in new technologies that help to combat climate change. Dorman is the main investor in the Yadlamalka Energy project, which is also supported by an Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) grant of AUD 5.7 million.
pv magazine Australia: This is the largest vanadium flow battery to be constructed by Invinity to date, and perhaps the largest of its type in the world. Is this a demonstration case for the capabilities of vanadium flow technology?
Matt Harper: It’s certainly the first example of a project, close coupled with solar, where we are operating as a direct producer of electricity onto the grid. Most of our projects to date have been in behind-the-meter applications where we’re installing our batteries in service of electricity users or companies who are trying to decrease their electricity costs, so they’re using the battery to offset peak tariff period utilisation, or they’re looking to more effectively manage their own solar generation, say on the roof of a factory.
You’ve said that grids increasingly powered by renewables really need a diversity of storage technologies. Why do we need more than lithium ion?
The fundamental difference between a lithium ion battery and a vanadium flow battery is that in vanadium flow batteries, you don’t have the same cycle-charge degradation that you see with other technologies. You know, when you charge and discharge your cell phone battery, in two or three years you’ve lost 20% or 30% or 40% of the charge. In terms of building large-scale, heavy infrastructure for the electricity grid, you need something more durable. It doesn’t mean that lithium ion batteries aren’t good grid participants. They are tremendous for replacing so-called peaking power plants, that are required to dispatch for a few hours on maybe 50 or 100 days of the year to meet the absolute highest demand on the grid.
But we’re focused on working exclusively with renewable power, in this case solar energy, and taking a portion of that generation from the middle of the day to shift it, every day, into the evening peak period, when that electricity is most in demand and is most valuable. And because we don’t have that sort of degradation every time we charge and discharge the battery, we can do that every day of the year to match the 20- to 30-year life of solar or wind-generating plants colocated with the battery.
How much more expensive are vanadium flow batteries compared to lithium ion?
They’re slightly more expensive today for the initial capital cost, but if you look at the cost of every megawatt-hour delivered by the battery over its lifetime, they’re significantly less expensive.
Why do you think we don’t have more of them in the grid to date? Is the technology just new and untested?
The technology was actually invented at the University of New South Wales back in the late 1980s. But it’s really only in the last five to 10 years that there have been significant deployments of vanadium flow batteries to commercial industrial facilities. Bringing any new technology into the grid to serve a large part of grid users’ needs takes a long time. Think about solar power: Solar panels were invented, or first built in large numbers, in the late 1970s, early 1980s, but it took three decades before they started to become a meaningful part of the generation mix on the electricity grid. Similarly, lithium ion batteries were invented in around that same time frame, and it’s really only in the last five or six years that lithium batteries have become a big part of the energy mix. We argue that the vanadium flow battery is complementary to these two types of devices, that it takes over where lithium leaves off in terms of providing that day-to-day very long-duration cycle. But when it comes to the grid, no-one wants to be first.
How is Yadlamalka’s grid connection progressing?
We are in the middle of the regulatory process. The advantage that we have in this case is that we can serve multiple applications within this one site. For example, not only are we taking solar in the middle of the day and deploying in the evening when it’s needed. The battery will also participate in some of the regulation services that help the local grid maintain frequency, voltages and sufficiency of energy 24 hours a day. From the grid operator’s perspective this project is hugely beneficial. It may be a new approach, so there isn’t necessarily a crystal clear regulatory path for us to go down, but our interests and the interests of the regulator are very well aligned. So, where we don’t necessarily fit the common mould we’ve been able to come to an effective resolution that’s acceptable for everyone.
Are you generally supporting the National Electricity Market, with this battery, or is there a local need for energy-shifting at Yadlamalka?
It is very much a local set of constraints that pushed in this direction. Originally, the landowner  wanted to install solar and found that it was going to be difficult to connect to the grid because of some of the local capacity constraints. What our battery is allowing him to do is to modulate when that power flows out onto the grid and therefore get a larger solar project installed in the local area.
What does it mean to Invinity to have ARENA support this project?
First of all, we’re enormously grateful for their financial support. Without their contribution, it would have been much harder to make the project come together. There’s a higher degree of risk that comes along with a project like this, especially with some of the regulatory hurdles and new-technology integration challenges. The other aspect is that on my side of the world, up in Canada, ARENA has a tremendous reputation for its ability to nurture the adoption of new and emerging technologies onto the grid, to help advance sustainability and greenhouse gas targets while at the same time building an economically stable future energy system.
Do you expect that ARENA’s publication of the results of this project will validate the deployment of vanadium-flow batteries at scale on the grid?
It’s one of the things we’re most excited about. It’s all well and good for us to go to the market and talk about the things that we’re doing, but for us to be involved in this project with a third party agency like ARENA who are independently observing, recording and publishing the results of the project is a huge piece of external validation.
