The new product, which features a conversion efficiency of 21.6%, was conceived for large scale solar power projects and is the most powerful panel manufactured by the company to date.
Trina said the panel is based on 210mm wafers, non-destructive cutting, high-density interconnection, and multi-busbar (MBB) technology. “The MBB and high-density interconnection improve the module efficiency to up to 21.6% while the non-destructive cutting pioneered by Trina Solar significantly reduces the risks of cell micro-crack[-ing] and power loss,” it explained.
The module, as with other powerful products of the Vertex series, is claimed to reduce, significantly, both the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the balance-of-system (BoS) costs of a project, due to the reduced number of arrays that can be achieved with bigger and better-performing panels. “In large scale power plants, the 670 W Vertex has 28 modules on each string,” said Zhang Yingbin, head of global product strategy and market at Trina Solar.
Trina estimates the module can provide a 12% drop in transportation cost and 5-7% decrese in installation cost, as a result of a reduction of the non-silicon cost of silicon wafers and cells for the upstream supply chain, and a cost reduction for trackers, pile foundations, cables and labor. “Compared to other 500 W+ modules in the industry, BoS cost savings are at least RMB0.08-0.09 ($0.012-0.013) per watt hence … a significant overall advantage,” the manufacturer said. The module is also claimed to optimize container-space utilization in transportation.
Trina launched its 635-660 W Vertex series last summer. It also unveiled a 600 W version of the Vertex panel.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/11/adding-solar-to-offshore-wind/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE,NETHERLANDS",MARK HUTCHINS,"MARCH 11, 2021",Adding solar to offshore wind,"As solar continues to grow its share in the world’s energy mix, the issues of land availability and intermittent generation become ever more important to deal with. Combining solar and wind generation has shown several advantages in balancing energy yields over a longer period – since sunny and windy conditions tend to occur at different times.
A recent study from Ireland suggests that adding more solar to the country’s considerable wind capacity could help to stabilize prices in the long term; and plans for large solar-wind hybrid projects are in action all over the world. Meanwhile, on the land usage side, floating solar projects have been implemented successfully on inland waters for several years now, and developers are beginning to consider the much larger challenge of installing PV at sea.
Looking at both of these opportunities to further solar’s growth, scientists led by Utrecht University in the Netherlands carried out a feasibility study for a floating solar installation incorporated into a new 752 MW wind farm located in the North Sea close to the Netherlands southern border. The study is presented in the paper Pooling the cable: A techno-economic feasibility study of integrating offshore floating photovoltaic solar technology within an offshore wind park, published in the journal Solar Energy.
The wind farm in the study is connected to the Dutch grid via a 700 MW transmission cable, and the researchers focus on the optimal use of this cable capacity. The group first combined historic wind and solar irradiance data to calculate the potential energy yield of the wind, and calculated the effects of adding PV in increments of 100 MW – finding, for example, that 300 MW of PV could be integrated at the site, and only 1.72% of its yield would need to be curtailed due to exceeding the cable capacity.
Factoring in the high investment costs due to limited experience in floating PV at sea, the group finds integrating the two would only be feasible for now with a subsidy to support the technology’s development. However, their calculations show that adding solar could lead to better usage of the connection cable, and that if offshore PV can achieve further maturity the approach could be useful in the future. “The combination of an offshore solar PV system and a wind farm can be beneficial in technical and economical terms,” the scientists state. “We have calculated optimal wind and solar combined capacity given meteorological conditions in the North Sea, showing that curtailment of solar is quite limited.”
The case study also demonstrates that for any potential site for an offshore solar-wind hybrid project, the weather conditions need to be carefully analyzed, along with the costs, to determine the optimal combination and capacity for either technology.
According to a recent report from DNV GL, the North Sea may host around 100 MW of floating solar capacity by 2030, and 500 MW by 2035. The LCOE of offshore PV systems is currently estimated at around €354/MWh but in the future it should be close to that of ground-mounted solar parks.

“A consortium led by Hanhwa Q Cells has been selected as preferred bidder,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine, without disclosing more details.
The manufacturer will likely supply its special panels developed for floating PV plants. These products are already being used in a 41 MW floating project that the company will build at a dam in Hapcheon, in South Korea's South Gyeongsang province, for Korea Water Resources Corp, which is a governmental agency that manages water resources.

With the South Korean chemicals business having banked a net KRW6.1 billion ($5.39 million) in the July-to-September period, the latest KRW263 billion ($233 million) impairment on its idled domestic poly production lines dragged the last quarterly figure into the red, even if the result was far better than the KRW661 billion shed in the final quarter of 2019 after previous write-downs.
Announcing its fourth-quarter figures on Tuesday, OCI said it had recognized a KRW750 billion ($663 million) impairment in 2019 after a sharp fall in the polysilicon selling price and intensified competition from expansionist rivals prompted it to idle its Gunsan facilities. At the time, said OCI, it was considering alternative uses for the production lines but an inability to do so, in part caused by the travails of Covid-19, has driven the latest asset write-down.
The chemicals company noted the fab is being maintained and any future use of the equipment could see the impairments altered, not least now the company has decided to concentrate on lower-grade polysilicon production for electronics in Gunsan whilst its solar poly will be made in its Malaysia factory.
That Malaysian production base aims to ramp up production from its current 30,000-metric-ton (MT) annual capacity to 35,000 MT by 2022, with the help of debottlenecking, and also intends to drive down production costs 15% from last year's figure. A three-year, $850 million polysilicon supply deal with Chinese solar manufacturer Longi will, no doubt, help, and OCI said it is considering “additional expansion.”
Full operation at the Malaysian site saw the ‘basic chemical' division of OCI which produces polysilicon post a 50% rise in manufacturing and sales volume from the location, compared with the third quarter, also prompting an 18% quarter-on-quarter fall in poly production costs.
The ‘energy solutions' division which includes OCI's solar plant development operation complained of rock-bottom prices for the renewable energy certificates generated by its solar farms and sold to companies which would otherwise fail to meet their mandated commitment to low-carbon power procurement.
With the basic chemical operation contributing 40% of OCI's revenue–versus energy solutions' 16%–the Gunsan-related fourth-quarter loss contributed to the parent posting a KRW135 billion quarterly rise in net debt as its gearing ratio rose from 75% to 86%.

The newly created company, called GreenIT, will be owned 51% by Eni and 49% by CDP Equity and will invest around €800 million in wind and solar projects by 2025. This sum, according to Eni, would be enough to deploy around 1 GW of renewable energy capacity.
Eni, whose largest shareholder is the Italian government with a 30.33% stake, specified that properties owned by CDP and the Italian public administration may be used to build the power plants. The project pipeline will also comprise the repowering of existing renewable energy facilities and shovel-ready projects that have already secured approval.
Eni has recently completed a 31 MW solar plant at one of its chemical industry sites in Sardinia and is planning to install 220 MW of PV power plants in the country, as well as a 14 MW floating PV project. It also launched a partnership with Italian state-owned utility Enel to bring online 20 MW of hydrogen capacity between 2022 and 2023.

Off-grid solar and mini-grids are generally associated with rural electrification projects in countries with weak power networks and in locations that are difficult to reach in terms of logistics and transport in Asia, Africa or the Americas. This kind of project, however, may also be beneficial for special applications in countries with strong energy systems.
The Austrian motorway company Asfinag, for example, is building a hybrid solar mini-grid to supply with power a motorway maintenance unit near Klagenfurt. The solar-plus-storage facility is mainly intended to immediately provide solar power to the entire site during nighttimes as well as at times when the electricity network fails. The project, which is being developed in partnership with Austrian general contractor KEM, is part of a plan to install similar mini-grids at all the company's maintenance facilities.
The mini-grid at the station in Klagenfurt was built with a 220 kW system and a storage system with a capacity of 522 kWh. The facility is linked to the power network but can also be disconnected, if necessary, and work as an independent power supply.
In the event of a failure of the power grid, the storage system seamlessly takes over the supply of the standalone grid with the help of the energy management system which was supplied, together with the batteries, by German specialist Dhybrid. In the battery operation mode, the energy management system also regulates the load management of three connected charging stations for electric vehicles from Asfinag with an output of up to 70 kW. If the capacity of the energy storage system is exhausted in the event of a persistent power failure, a fully automated back-up diesel generator is switched on.
When the blackout is over, the mini-grid is automatically reconnected with the network.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/11/manufacturing-amid-market-concentration/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"MARCH 11, 2021",Manufacturing amid market concentration,"From pv magazine 03/2021
Manufacturing capacity continues to grow across the PV supply chain. As manufacturers are ramping up to stay competitive and optimize costs, the impacts of unbalanced supply and demand will become even more pronounced. Manufacturer strategies and market trends are becoming clear toward the end of the first quarter.
The supply chain will see growing concentration of manufacturing capacity, with the polysilicon and wafer segments showing the dominance of a few big fish. The market share of Tier-1 polysilicon and wafer manufacturers is expected to reach 78% and 90%, respectively. Tier-1 cell and module makers also continue to ramp up capacity in response to large size trends. Capacity distribution is shifting toward large companies. PV InfoLink calculates that the estimated market share of Tier-1 cell and module manufacturers will respectively reach 87% and 60% this year.
From a supply perspective, Tier-1 manufacturer capacities are enough to meet market demand. With advantages in costs, technology, and branding, Tier-1 manufacturers will push Tier-2 players to slow capacity ramps and even edge them out of the market.

As PV production capacity increases, the market risks imbalance. Due to rising costs from accident-induced polysilicon shortages last year, vertically integrated companies announced capacity expansion plans. Consequently, cell capacity becomes excessive this year, and PV InfoLink calculates that continued expansions will bring the self-sufficiency rate of the 10 largest vertically integrated manufacturers to more than 80% by the end of the year.
Cell makers will need to transform to compete with these rivals. Since 2020, manufacturers have formed strategic alliances and signed long-term supply contracts. Some manufacturers have also begun to plan roadmaps for next-generation technology in the face of solar cell overcapacity. Longi, Jinko, Aiko and Tongwei, for example, may all earmark new production lines to be installed later for n-type. However, the progress of capacity expansion of HJT and TOPCon has been slow, as HJT needs to drive down costs and TOPCon needs to overcome technical barriers. The progress of GW-scale projects, the materialization of capacity expansion plans, and market consolidation trends will be crucial this year.
In addition to pushing supply chains to become integrated, the 10 largest vertically integrated companies have announced long-term glass supply plans to ensure smooth supplies. Against this backdrop, last year saw increasing monopolization, and as the market shifts to large-sized products, PV manufacturers will face a structural change in supply and demand, as well as competitive prices.
Size shift
The supply chain has experienced a shortage of products differing in size since 2020, thanks to the rapid size transition in China. This has occurred more slowly in overseas markets, resulting in a gap between end-user demand and products being promoted. Thus, solar products and bill of materials underwent short-term price turbulence, with prices for 158.75 mm G1 mono PERC cells exceeding that of 166 mm M6 cells for the first time. The size shifts suggest that such short-term structural gaps may occur at the final stage of a product’s life cycle: Prices will rise in the short term and decline as demand shifts.
The structural gap may also occur in the glass segment due to limitations in furnaces and longer time requirements on capacity expansion and adjustment. This year, Xinyi Glass, Flat Glass Group, CSG Holding, and Almaden will be ramping up capacity, while small-sized glass manufacturers reopen older production lines or plan to expand capacity. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has relaxed regulations on glass capacity expansion. However, supply of large-format glass will remain short because it will take time for new capacity to come online. In light of this, vertically integrated companies are active in signing long-term contracts in advance.
Price trends
Polysilicon shortages sent prices in the mid- and upstream segments up in Q1. As polysilicon and module bill of materials prices are expected to remain high in Q2, module manufacturers face rising cost pressures. Module prices will remain at a high level throughout the first half, with modules using M6 wafers expected to sit at $0.202-0.208/W, with a price gap of $0.01/W for modules based on 182 mm M10 wafers. The average prices of modules based on the 210 mm G12 wafers may be slightly higher.
Given that new production lines are expected during Q2 and Q3, in which the low season will fall, monofacial modules based on M6 wafers may decline to lower than $0.20/W. Moreover, manufacturers that supply large-format modules become more monopolized, and supply of large-format glass won’t be sufficient compared with conventional sizes. Therefore, there won’t be much price reduction in Q3. Prices for M10-based modules will decline to $0.202-0.21/W, but prices won’t collapse as they did after China’s June 30 installation rush in previous years. Overall, high module prices, high freight rates, and a weakening U.S. dollar, as well as the ongoing pandemic, may impact PV demand.
Vertically integrated companies are tightening controls over their supply and moving production in house, while manufacturers are active in forming partnerships to secure supplies and stay competitive amid the transition to large sizes. Some manufacturers are also planning n-type technology roadmaps to stay ahead in a rapidly changing market. Clearly, manufacturer strategies play a defining role in market concentration.

The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN), an exchange-traded fund that tracks solar and renewable energy companies, decreased 10.5% in February, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 1.8% and 3.8%, respectively.
Within the solar industry, the top five stock performers in the U.S. market for February were SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (SEDG), Sunnova Energy International, Inc. (NOVA), Daqo New Energy (DQ), Enphase Energy (EPNH), and First Solar (FSLR). These companies witnessed changes of -5.1%, -6.0%, -10.5%, -11.3%, and -12.6%, respectively.
Rising prices
The decline in the solar industry over the past month can be attributed to market headwinds, including increased pricing throughout the supply chain. More specifically, this applied to many of the major PV module components, including polysilicon, glass, and silver.
China’s forced labor issue potentially affected polysilicon supplied from Xinjiang, and there was a healthy correction after markets reached historic highs in January.
Bounce back
Despite the downturn in February, the overall global solar market maintains a positive outlook. Anticipated demand in both China and Europe remains strong.
Module prices are expected to begin to decrease, after polysilicon pricing reached a resistance level of CNY 100 (approximately $13.68/kg) earlier this month.
Additionally, the U.S. House of Representatives has reintroduced the Growing Renewable Energy and Efficiency Now (GREEN) Act, which aims to extend a 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for five years. It will likely be passed in the months to come.

That was the verdict of Longgen Zhang, CEO of Chinese polysilicon producer Daqo New Energy as he presented his company's unaudited fourth-quarter and full-year figures this week.
Zhang spoke of the prospect of “tremendous growth over the next few years without the need for government subsidies,” and the reasons for such unabashed bullishness were laid out in a set of almost flawless numbers presented by a company which manufactures the basic ingredient of solar panels.
Daqo manufactured a record 21,008 metric tons (MT) of polysilicon in the final three months of 2020 and bumper sales, particularly in November and December, meant the business posted a new landmark in that respect too, shifting 23,186 MT to customers in the October-to-December window.
Those record volumes come on the back of an aggressive production capacity expansion program and, with Zhang predicting demand for monosilicon-grade poly will mean “the supply of polysilicon will continue to be very tight throughout the year, given very limited additional polysilicon supply this year,” that strategy shows no sign of stopping.
With Daqo's main Xinjiang subsidiary preparing for an IPO on the science and tech Star market of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the CEO said the funds raised would finance ‘Phase 4B' of the production capacity plans to bring another 35,000 MT of annual manufacturing capacity into full service by April next year. Construction of the new lines is set to start next week, Zhang indicated, with the building to be finished this year.
With the trade numbers all pointing in the right direction–even though silicon raw material costs rose between the third and fourth quarters and year-round average selling prices dipped slightly from 2019–Daqo has already started paying down the bill run up by its new production facilities.
Total borrowings sat at $194 million at the end of the year, down from $271 million at the end of September and $280 million at the close of 2019, and the company had $118 million in the bank at the end of the year, up from $110 million at the end of September and $115 million on December 31, 2019.
Daqo was able to keep the bank manager happy on the back of those record sales volumes and rising average selling prices during last year which added up to revenue of $248 million during the fourth quarter and $676 million for the full year. Those figures compare with $119 million and $350 million, respectively, for the same periods of 2019.
The resulting net income for shareholders was $73 million for October-to-December and $129 million for the 12 months, up from $20 million and $29.5 million, respectively.
With Daqo having manufactured 77,288 MT of poly last year and sold 74,812 MT–up from 41,556 MT and 38,110 MT a year earlier–the business said it expects to produce 19,500-20,500 MT in the current three-month window and to sell 20-21,000 MT of it, as part of an anticipated 2021 production run of 80-81,000 MT.

It is abundant in nature, non-toxic, and can be supplied at a low cost. Furthermore, it has a near-optimal direct bandgap of about 1.3 eV, a high level of environmental and chemical stability, and a high absorbance coefficient.
Although the efficiency of solar cells built with this technology lags behind other established thin-film solar materials, such as cadmium telluride (CdTe) or copper, indium, gallium selenide (CIGS), tin sulfide can potentially be produced at such a low cost that their application on small devices or in building-integrated PV should be a possibility.
With this in mind, a group of scientists from Japan's Tohoku University has built an SnS single-junction solar cell. Despite the low conversion efficiency of 1.4%, the group claims its approach brings with it the potential to push SnS solar cells beyond the highest efficiencies achieved so far, which stand at 4-5%.
The device developed by the Japanese group was fabricated with a special p-type film of the compound. “P-type SnS is easy to fabricate, but the same cannot be said of n-type SnS,” it explained. “The complexity of fabricating n-type SnS has stalled the manufacturing of the p-n homojunction for SnS solar cells.”
The researchers built the device with p‐type thin films consisting of columnar grains and large n-type SnS single crystals. The interface of the p-n single junctions was designed to be void‐free and compositionally sharp. “The large crystals were grown using an original technique released in August 2020,” they said. The process consists of facilitating the growth of crystals measuring up to 24mm in diameter. Crystals of this size are necessary to form a junction with the much easier to fabricate p-type equivalent.
The solar cell showed a conversion efficiency of 1.4% and an open‐circuit voltage (VOC) of 360 mV, which the scientists described as the highest VOC value ever reached for SnS‐based heterojunction solar cells. “This is remarkable since this is only our first prototype,” said researcher Sakiko Kawanishi, adding that the result was achieved with no device optimization.
The solar cell is presented in the paper SnS Homojunction Solar Cell with n‐Type Single Crystal and p‐Type Thin Film, published in RRL Solar. The group also measured the cell's fill factor (FF) at 53% and a short-circuit current (JSC) of 7.5 mA cm−2.

The urban planning department of the municipality of Santiago do Cacém, Portugal, has told pv magazine that the environmental authorities are currently evaluating a proposed 1 GW solar project with Tesla batteries.
Several Portuguese newspapers, including Expresso and Diario Campanario, have already revealed that the project is being developed by Sunshining. However, the unit of Spanish-Portuguese solar developer Prosolia has thus far declined to comment on the project, which will likely require an investment of around €1 billion.
At the beginning of January, Portuguese grid operator Redes Energéticas Nacionais (REN) said that 80 power projects, totaling 17 GW of capacity, are under consideration for the national electricity system. However, Portugal's grid capacity is already strained. Now, the only way to develop PV projects in the country is to participate in public auctions or to obtain a grid-connection approval among hundreds of project proposals that have yet to reach the status of “projects of interest” for the system.
Prosolia secured a project in the solar auction held by the Portuguese government in 2019. If built, its new project could almost double the nation's total installed PV capacity, which stood at  1,030 MW by the end of October 2020.

That meant solar developers had zero access to critical power grid connection information, substation status, and other local solar plant connections. We were flying blind.
In practice, this is how it worked from a solar sales perspective:
1. Find a viable business owner interested in solar
2. Owner signs deal
3. Developer submits the interconnection request … and hopes for the best.
The risks could be mitigated somewhat by knowing the power grid well, or by tracking down an insider willing to answer specific questions. However, the developers’ obligation to take on power grid risk slowed efficient markets from forming.
Since then, multiple states have created legal requirements forcing electric monopolies to share their power grid data with solar developers via what are known as hosting capacity analysis (HCA) maps. States that now provide HCA maps include California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. More recently, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council and the Clean Coalition of California have made large contributions to the maps.
With the evolution of these HCA maps, developers now have access to something that previously was elusive: useful data. As outlined in an earlier pv magazine USA article, these still-young hosting capacity maps haven’t always shown the most accurate information, meaning that solar developers might not have reached out to customers in these regions.
Rhode Island HCA maps
Utility National Grid operates in Rhode Island and illustrates local line capacities with its HCA map. Surplus availability for solar capacity – always listed in AC/inverter sizing terms – is determined by the utility and based on the minutia inherent to each circuit. The highest capacity locations are seen in dark blue.
Additional information includes total solar already on the circuit, the circuit’s voltage, whether the circuit is three-phase or single-phase, and a range of substation bank information.
Each utility has a set of rules and disclaimers governing the information they release, and what that information represents on their maps. Adding complexity, there’s still the human factor involved, because the numbers aren’t entirely accurate in all places; think of them as a guide.
For example, a recent 200 kW (AC) project in Rhode Island learned when the interconnection application was submitted that no additional solar power was on either the local circuit or at the substation. But by the time the project’s interconnection was returned, a 5 MW solar project had won approval at the substation. As a result, the smaller 200 kW project was told that the substation was full, and that it would have to share a roughly $650,000 upgrade cost, potentially delaying the project until the upgrades were complete.
As it turned out, the larger-scale ground-mount project was moving slowly due to local resistance. Without offering an explanation, when the final interconnection for the 200 kW project was approved, the utility assessed no new fees. As of today, that big solar power plant is still pending, but the small one is complete.
Grid resources
Properly designed, the hosting capacity maps offer the ability to look closely at our power grid resources. Southern California Edison’s hosting maps contain a built-in function enabling users to filter sites based on available capacity above a certain threshold. As a solar developer and individual cheering for a strong power grid, few pieces of data are as useful as site data sorted by grid demand.
Knowing exactly what circuits can handle – and which circuits are arguably in need of solar power – is like a treasure map.

London-based Eco Energy World (EEW) has announced plans for a AUD 500 million ($385.4 million) solar green hydrogen plant in Gladstone, Australia. EEW, which is already developing a 300 MW solar project in Ragland, Queensland, plans to combine the PV plant with a major green hydrogen project.
Gladstone, a traditional coal and gas hub, is on its way to becoming a green hydrogen mecca, with several ambitious projects already in the pipeline, including Hydrogen Utility’s proposed industrial complex for the large-scale production of green hydrogen and ammonia. The H2-HubTM Gladstone facility will be built in stages.
Sumitomo also announced plans in February to build a hydrogen production plant in Gladstone. These developments mean that the regional city is well on its way to becoming one of the world’s major export hubs for green hydrogen. 
EEW’s plan is to combine the 300 MW solar plant, which is currently at a ready-to-build stage, with a 200 MW hydrogen plant and a 100 MW energy storage facility. EEW estimates the project will be able to produce 33,000 tons of green hydrogen annually. 
EEW Chairman Svante Kumlin said that the state of Queensland and Gladstone in particular are “well-positioned strategically to act as a major player in the future generation and export of hydrogen. This is due to its existing gas pipeline infrastructure, access to a deep-water export port at Gladstone and significant solar resources that make it an extremely attractive location for this emerging industry.” 
Generate green hydrogen using solar and wind, convert it into ammonia for ease of transport, and ship it globally. Sacha Thacker, chief strategy officer of Intercontinental Energy – the project manager and major stakeholder in the 26 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub in Western Australia’s Pilbara region – told pv magazine Australia that the world needs solutions now. 
“We are not at all worried about excess supply or lack of demand because the demand drivers are there. More and more countries are committing, Korea, Japan, China, the U.S. has changed its stance,” Thacker said. “There is a lot of demand and not that many choices, and even fewer choices that can be produced at scale.”
