The Dublin-based independent power producer (IPP) announced the closing of a €240 million construction equity facility with a consortium of lenders managed by Eiffel Investment Group, along with Belgian insurer Ethias and the European Investment Bank.
The solar projects are expected to begin commercial operations in 2025. The first phase of investment will total €100 million. It will be used to build solar assets benefiting from power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed with Microsoft and another undisclosed technology company. The remaining solar projects were awarded tariffs in the Irish RESS2 auction, according to a PCRE statement.
“This new European support for 1.2 GW of solar power investment across Ireland is a vote of confidence for Irish renewables,” said the Irish Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications Eamon Ryan. “It will enable solar electricity to replace fossil fuel usage to power Ireland on sunny days and contribute to our target of up to 5 GW of solar energy by 2025.”
PCRE will use €100 million to build its remaining solar project pipeline. It said it might assign another €40 million to support its international expansion plans.
“It is fantastic to attract a club of such significant investors into the Irish solar sector. We have already commenced construction and expect 230 MW to be completed by late this year across counties Cork, Wexford, Louth and Meath,” said Justin Brown and Peter Duff, co-CEOs of PCRE. “Having the support from Eiffel Investment Group, EIB and Ethias will allow us to rapidly expand our construction roll out over the next years.”

“These microinverters are the cost-effective versions added to Hoymiles classic HMS series,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “They have four input channels, meaning that one microinverter can be connected with four solar panels at once – which is why we call it a ‘four in one.' Therefore, for the same capacity demand, users can just have one microinverter instead of four regular ones.”
The recommended PV module voltage range is between 320 W and 670 W, with a maximum input voltage of 65 V. The HMS-C line has efficiency ratings up to 96.7% and a nominal maximum power point tracker (MPPT) efficiency of 99.8%.
“What makes the new C series different from the previous HMS series is that they have two MPPTs rather than four, meaning that two panels share one MPPT,” the manufacturer claimed. “This twist offers a great balance between efficient performance and affordability.”
The nominal output voltage is between 220 V and 240 V, and the adjustable output voltage ranges from 180 V to 275 V.
The microinverters measure 331 mm x 195 mm x 42.6 mm and weigh 5.32 kg. They feature an IP67 enclosure rating and a cooling system based on natural convection. The series is connected to Hoymiles’ smart monitoring platform, S-Miles Cloud, so that users can access visual data on the system’s energy production and usage. The new HMS-C series is available in Europe, North America, and Oceania.

Established in 2008, the $3 million ZSP recognizes organizations and high schools that can demonstrate real-world impact through innovative sustainability solutions in the fields of health, food, energy, water and global high schools. Each winner receives $600,000. One consistent feature among many of the diverse group of nominees and winners of the 2023 ZSP was the utilization of solar.
The top award in the energy category was taken by Jordan-based Neurotech, a company that develops AI-based algorithms with a blockchain-based transaction system, in order to better manage energy access in refugee camps. A Neurotech spokesperson told pv magazine that prior to its smart energy management intervention, more than 10,000 Syrian refugees in Azraq, Jordan, were limited to a maximum of 13 hours of energy access daily.
“Our solution has now enabled 24-hour energy access and can be replicated at other remote sites in a tailored fashion,” the spokesperson said.
By optimizing the energy coming into the camp from PV and from the grid, Neurotech reduced pressure on the camp's medical facilities during the Covid-19 pandemic, specifically enabling the 24/7 respiratory section.
Neurotech's ZSP-winning solution has also prioritized energy management for lay people. Neurotech's spokesperson said the technology solution provides simple informational cues to help people uneducated in moderating electricity consumption better moderate their usage.

Solar schools 
It is no secret that younger generations are adapting to a sustainability mindset much easier than older generations. Among the innovative schools to receive 2023 ZSP awards are Kamil Muslim College in Fiji and Romain-Rolland Gymnasium in Germany.
Students from Kamil Muslim College told pv magazine their school's 14 kW rooftop solar installation is the basis of community-wide benefits. The school's system is capable of operating both on and off the grid, making it a hub for the local community in times of need.
Thanks to the school's reliable solar power, the student-led program enables, among other things, an onsite nursing infirmary. The students are now looking at using the ZSP prize money to expand solar capacity, add a solar water pump featuring an “air to water converter,” and potentially invest in energy storage, but also a hydroponics system so food can be produced for school lunches. The school hopes to generate 219 MWh of solar power annually in the near future.
The Romain-Rolland Gymnasium in Berlin is just as forward thinking. The school proposes to build a working student-built and solar-powered electrolysis based hydrogen fuel cell. Student representatives told pv magazine they want their school to become an “innovation hub where students will be able to see how these technologies work.”
By expanding this project the school hopes to boost their renewable energy usage from 2% to 10%, while inspiring students to research in the fields of renewable energy generation.
UAE minister of industry and advanced technology, chair of Masdar and director general of the ZSP, Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, said that “as the UAE prepares to host COP28 later this year, the Zayed Sustainability Prize stands as a critical reminder of the UAE’s commitment to accelerating practical solutions needed to help societies mitigate and adapt to climate change.”

The demonstration module has a power output of 566 W, an average efficiency of 22.9%, and features a gapless design. The HJT cells are manufactured in France on CEA’s pilot line at INES and include innovations limiting the consumption of indium and silver.
“It achieves a very low carbon footprint of 317 kgCO2eq/kWp compared to standard Chinese products (700 to 800 kgCO2eq/kW) and places our laboratories among the leaders in Europe,” CEA said in a statement.
The new module uses Norwegian-made silicon wafers with a thickness of 130 microns instead of 170 microns, thereby reducing the carbon footprint on a cell scale. The wafers’ polysilicon was sourced from Germany.
The panel is fully assembled in France and uses 2 mm glass. It features a frame made of wood material available in Europe, replacing the standard aluminum frame. This reportedly reduced the carbon footprint by more than 50 kgCO2eq/kW.
The low carbon mix in the electricity mix in Germany, Norway, and France was the main factor in reducing the module’s carbon footprint. According to CEA, these countries have a carbon mix of 650 gCO2eq/kWh, 29 gCO2eq/kWh, and 52 gCO2eq/kWh, respectively, compared to the Chinese mix, with a carbon balance of 1023 gCO2eq/kWh.
“A ‘design for recycle' approach has led to the choice of fluorine-free thermoplastic encapsulants and back sheets of European origin, which will facilitate recycling,” said CEA.
The eco-design approach included a life cycle assessment in accordance with ISO14040 and ISO14044 standards.

The risk of a nuclear incident in Ukraine is extremely high. In 2022, Ukraine not only became the arena for a level of military aggression in Europe not seen since World War II, but a testing ground for the cynical use of nuclear facilities as a tool for intimidation and blackmail. When news of the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant emerged in April, the world was shocked. There has never before been a military conflict, using all types of modern warfare, in a country with multiple nuclear power plants. The largest nuclear site in Europe, third largest in the world – Zaporizhzhia – is directly in the combat zone.
Solving the issue of nuclear security in Ukraine and therefore, Europe, unfortunately lies more in the military-political sphere than the technological one. Russia continues to destroy Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. Before the war began, on Feb. 24, the Ukrainian and Russian energy systems had been synchronized, so all vulnerable points are known to Russia.
As of Dec. 15, Ukraine has lost 43% of its energy infrastructure, including substations and power lines, and 48% of its electricity generation capacity. These facilities will be partially restored but a significant portion will need building from scratch. And this is assuming there will be no further missile strikes against them by Russia, which is unlikely.
It is a miracle Ukraine has managed to ensure the safety of its nuclear facilities until now. Thanks to the tireless efforts of Ukrainian and international specialists, it was possible to avoid a nuclear disaster in November that would have significantly surpassed the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear accidents.
Ukraine operates 15 nuclear power units with a capacity of 13.8 GW. Almost all have been in emergency mode for two months and the 6 GW Zaporizhzhia – captured by the Russians in April and put into cold mode – is not generating at all.
On Nov. 15, 2022, Russian missiles destroyed a transformer substation in the Khmelnytskyi region and cut off four 750 kV power lines, causing the Khmelnytskyi nuclear plant to lose access to electrical networks and rely on diesel generators, for over 10 hours, to cool the reactors. If those emergency systems had failed, Europe would have experienced a major incident as the reactor melted.
On Nov. 23, a missile strike caused an emergency shutdown of all power units at the South Ukraine nuclear plant. Russian rockets knocked out the high-voltage electricity line to Odesa.
The Rivne nuclear plant lost connection to a 750 kV power transmission line, causing the VVER-1000 units to shut down, and left two smaller reactors with a combined capacity of only 600 MW. This imbalance caused the disconnection of electricity for more than 70% of Ukraine, with the rest receiving electricity for only a few hours per day.
It is difficult to stabilize the energy system during the conflict. However, it is important to note the current critical situation is also the result of centralized energy infrastructure and the Ukrainian government’s – and oligarchs’ – focus on nuclear, which has meant neglect of alternative energy sources such as renewables. Decentralization of energy supply and the development of renewables could have helped prevent the current situation, but such ideas were met with skepticism and dismissed in favor of prioritizing profit over long-term stability.
The current lack of electricity in Ukraine and the lesson the situation should serve for nuclear lobbyists everywhere highlights the importance of diversifying energy sources and considering the potential consequences of relying solely on centralized, potentially vulnerable systems.
Today, the optimal strategy for Ukraine in the energy sector would be to develop a decentralized infrastructure of co-generation plants using a variety of energy sources, including liquefied gas, ethanol, natural gas, and renewable energy sources. The idea is to create an energy cluster in each region that is tailored to local needs and opportunities.
While this strategy may result in higher electricity prices, it would provide stability and energy security. I would also suggest building gas-fired power plants near Ukraine’s main gas pipelines, as these are Russia’s main infrastructure for supplying natural gas to Europe. It is unlikely that Russia would be willing to strike these facilities and disrupt its own gas supplies as the country heavily relies on its gas resources.
In chaos of war, it would be more beneficial for Ukraine to develop distributed generation of renewable energy sources, such as biomass, wind, and solar power with energy storage, rather than relying on centralized power plants fueled by coal, gas, and oil. This would not only make it more difficult for the enemy to destroy a large number of small energy-generation facilities but it would also reduce the country’s dependence on various types of fuel. In the future, I believe, Ukraine will shift from a testing ground for new weapons to a testing ground for the latest energy technologies. My forecast is that by 2030, half of the country’s electricity production will come from renewable sources.

Mesia has highlighted the most important achievements of key regional solar markets over the past year in its latest report, with a look at national solar goals up to 2030.
Algeria added 59 MW of new solar capacity in 2022, up from 12 MW in 2021. The country inaugurated a new PV module factory with an annual capacity of 200 MW. It manufactures p-type PERC M3 modules with outputs ranging between 405 W and 415 W. This year, it will start producing M10 and M12 sizes, according to Mesia.
Bahrain continues to run its net metering scheme, but it still has yet to implement a feed-in-tariff (FIT) scheme and renewable energy mandate for new buildings, as outlined in its 2017 renewable energy legislation.  
In Egypt, renewable energy reached 20% of the electricity mix by the end of 2022, but solar accounted for just 2% of the total. The country’s net metering scheme is expected to support the expansion of distributed PV going forward, particularly utility-scale projects for onsite consumption in the agriculture, cement, and commercial sectors, Mesia said.
Iran added 8.29 MW of rooftop solar in 2022, reaching a cumulative solar installed capacity of 519 MW. The Iranian government has revoked power purchase agreements with private developers of utility-scale projects. Going forward, the commissioning of large-scale PV projects will only be organized through government tenders.
Jordan is expected to introduce energy storage legislation in 2023. It currently has 1,498 MW of commercial PV projects under PPAs and 1,027 MW of small-scale installations under net metering and wheeling schemes. It will start operating an electric connection with Iraq in 2023, initially for 150 MW of electricity, with a potential capacity expansion to 900 MW in the future.
Lebanon experienced “exponential growth in the solar PV and [battery energy storage] segments” in 2022, according to Mesia. However, the country does not keep any official records of its installed solar capacity. The Lebanese government approved a distributed renewable energy production law in March, allowing renewable energy producers to directly sell electricity to end users, distributors, or other electricity suppliers through on-grid or off-grid PPAs.
Morocco’s cumulative solar capacity reached 830 MW in 2022. The Moroccan commercial and industrial (C&I) market is expected to take shape in the years to come, following the passage of a long-awaited law allowing businesses to connect their renewable sources to the medium-voltage grid.
Oman commissioned its largest PV park in 2022, the Ibri Solar Power Plant with a capacity of 500 MW. Commissioning of two other solar plants with a cumulative capacity of 500 MW is scheduled for the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024.
Qatar plans to introduce net metering regulation in 2023. The 800 MW Al Kharsaah Solar Power Plant was inaugurated in October 2022.
Saudi Arabia expects to have a 40 GW solar market by 2030, with growth to be driven by auctions, unsolicited bilateral utility contracts, corporate PPAs, and state-owned projects. A 2 GW solar park is scheduled to come online by the end of 2025.
Sudan’s cumulative PV capacity has reached 200 MW according to the latest official statistics, but “the number is expected to be much higher, given that most installed projects are off-grid,” according to Mesia. In November, the Sudanese government announced a new net-metering scheme for projects with a capacity under 1 MW. The country’s largest solar plant was commissioned last year, with a capacity of 54 MW.
Tunisia commissioned MENA’s first floating solar plant in June 2022, according to the report. The 200 kW installation is located in Tunis.
Turkey started updating its storage legislation in 2022 and is expected to pass it soon, said Mesia. Last year it started mandating all buildings with construction areas of more than 5,000 square meters to generate at least 5% of their energy use from solar or wind.
In 2022, the United Arab Emirates introduced regulation to increase the percentage of renewables in the country’s electricity mix to 60% by 2035. “These regulations are the first legally binding regulatory framework for clean and renewable energy in the electricity sector in the Middle East,” concluded Mesia.

It has also secured exemptions from customs tax and value-added tax, in addition to other fiscal sweeteners and employees.
According to a document in the Turkish official journal, the company has secured a total of TRY 3.7 billion for its factory, including the new tranche. With the expansion plan, the ingot-to-module factory's annual solar module capacity will likely increase from 1 GW to 2 GW.
Kalyon inaugurated its manufacturing facility in August 2020. It is part of a wider project involving the construction of a 1 GW solar plant 260 km south of the Turkish capital, in Konya.
The project was tendered by the Turkish government in 2017. A consortium formed by Konya Solar and Hanhwa Q Cells was the winner, but the South Korea-based solar manufacturer walked away from the deal a few months later. Chinese state-owned conglomerate China Electronics Technology Group Corp. (CETC) replaced Hanhwa Q Cells as a new project partner in October 2019.
In October, another Turkish manufacturer, Smart Solar Technologies, secured TRY 7.62 billion of funding from the Turkish government to set up a 2 GW vertically integrated solar module manufacturing facility in Izmir, Turkey.

Trina Solar said it filed the lawsuit with the Suzhou Intermediate People’s Court (IP section), which accepted the complaint.
“Hanwha Q Cells is unlawfully exporting and selling solar modules, infringing a patent granted to Trina Solar by the China National Intellectual Property Administration in 2016,” the Chinese solar module manufacturer said in a statement to pv magazine. “The lawsuit involves the core cell technology commonly used in Hanwha's current modules produced in China and sold globally. The alleged infringing products include Q.PEAK DUO BLK M-G11A+, Q.PEAK DUO M-G11 and other key products.”
The company said that several Hanwha products related to the patents that were ready for shipping have already been seized by the customs authorities in China.
“If unlawful infringement is established, Hanwha will be prohibited from producing and selling these products and is likely to be forced to pay significant compensation to Trina Solar,” said Trina.
If Trina succeeds in proving its claims in China, Hanwha Q Cells could be prohibited from producing and selling the infringing products in China and other countries. It could also face high infringement compensation for past production and sales.
Hanwha Q Cells (Qidong) was established in 2004 in Qidong, in China's Jiangsu province. It soon became one of Hanwha’s major solar module production units. According to Taiwanese consultancy PV InfoLink, Hanwha Q Cells had a total module capacity of 9.9 GW at the end of 2022, with at least 2 GW coming from its Qidong factory.
“Hanwha Solutions is committed to its ongoing endeavours to establishing a healthy industry landscape in which time- and capital-intensive R&D efforts are properly protected,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “Q Cells sets exemplary standards in this matter, and as such we are confident that the company can successfully defend and ultimately have this particular legal case decided in our favor because we strongly believe that our products do not infringe the patent in question.”
In late December, a German court issued a preliminary injunction ordering Trina Solar to stop selling its Honey and Vertex X solar modules in Germany, as they allegedly infringe upon the patented passivation technologies of Hanwha Q Cells.
In late October, Hanwha Solutions filed a preliminary injunction request in which it claimed that Trina Solar (Germany) had been improperly selling solar modules in the German market. It claimed that the Trina Solar panels infringed upon one of its own patents for its proprietary Q.ANTUM passivation technology. It say this technology plays a key role in improving the performance of silicon-based solar cells.

The system uses a vapor compression refrigeration system with R134a refrigerant. It has two separate compartments for warming and cooling, with a volume of 50 liters each. The condenser operates at 50 C and lies at the bottom of the heating compartment. The evaporator works at -2 C and is placed at the top of the colling space.
“This arrangement is informed by the physical phenomenon that hot air rises and cool air descends,” the scientists explained.
The warming and refrigerant compartments use the same compressor. The scientists simulated the system’s heat loads using MATLAB, showing a heat load of 433.5 kJ and a cooling load of 3,550.7 kJ. To meet these loads, they selected a 12 V DC compressor with a capacity ranging from 149 W to 186 W. The academics calculated the system’s performance using the modeling system ANSYS, estimating a coefficient of performance (COP) for refrigeration of 3.32 and for heating of 4.32.
They built a prototype of the dual system using two small household fridges as cooling and heating compartments and tested it in Bellville, Cape Town. The system uses two 90 W monocrystalline silicon PV panels from an undisclosed manufacturer measuring 1,200 mm x 544 mm x 25 mm. It also includes a 12 V DC battery and a 10 A charge controller.
The team tested the system between December 2020 and January 2021 – the summer months in South Africa. The results show that the heat pump warmed the hot compartment to a maximum of 55 C during peak sun hours, between noon and 2 pm (SAST).
“However, it was observed that once the door was left open for more than 15 minutes, a drop in temperature was evident at 3 pm … while running the heat pump system,” the investigators said.
The refrigerated compartment reached a low temperature of 2 C. The scientists also compared the performance of the solar modules with zero- and 30-degree tilt for a north orientation. They said that they found that “the 30-degree tilted PV panel received higher irradiance, which caused both systems to reach their design temperatures right before noon; therefore it proved best suited for the entire system’s performance.”
The academics shared their findings in “A solar powered refrigerator and heat pump for urban street vendors,” which was recently published in MATEC Web of Conferences.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/17/soiling-a-multibillion-dollar-issue/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,SOILING,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JANUARY 17, 2023",Soiling – a multibillion-dollar issue,"Soiling – where PV modules become coated with dust, dirt, sand or snow and thus receive less sunlight – is still an underestimated problem for solar power systems. Specialized solutions are now available in the form of anti-soiling glass coatings, automated and manual cleaning products, and models to predict the ways to use them most economically. But our understanding of the issue is still evolving, particularly as PV systems move into new regions with different environmental conditions, and the technology itself continues to change and improve.
A new report by IEA-PVPS Task 13 seeks to push understanding of soiling a step further, taking a detailed look at the mechanisms causing soiling right down to the size and shape of the individual particles that build up on module’s surface, and the surrounding conditions that lessen or worsen its impacts.
The report estimates that in 2018, soiling caused at least a 3% to 4% loss to global annual energy production from PV – amounting to lost revenue of €3-5 billion. And this is expected to increase to around 4% to 5%, and €4 billion to €7 billion this year, thanks to an increase in PV installations in regions highly prone to soiling, economic pressures, and the fact that more efficient PV modules will suffer larger losses to their output due to soiling.
The report shows that soiling is a highly site-specific issue, and that even different areas within a single site can see quite different conditions. This leads the authors to place emphasis on accurate monitoring of these as a key part of the solution.
“An ideal solution should be installable with as little maintenance as possible and be able to detect heterogeneous soiling at both module and site level with high accuracy,” the scientists said.
Meanwhile, additional work is needed to develop accurate models to predict soiling rates at a given site, with current efforts either limited to a very small area, or based only on satellite data that is too generalized to give an accurate portrayal of site conditions.
They note encouraging progress in soiling reduction – with both preventive and corrective solutions now widely available – including anti-soiling coatings and design aspects such as optimized tilt angle, as well as cleaning solutions carefully designed not to damage modules or remove the aforementioned coatings. However, the best solution for any project will depend on the site conditions, and can be a delicate economic calculation placing emphasis on accurate monitoring and measurement.
The authors also note encouraging progress in both models and technologies to deal with snow loading on modules – as solar installations move into more regions affected by snowy conditions. Here they note that further work is needed on specialized components and designs for snowy conditions, with frameless modules, steeper tilt angles, snow-shedding coatings, bifacial modules, and attention to array heights to minimize snow accumulation on the bottom edges of modules all promising approaches.
The report does not address “anthropogenic, zoological or biological sources” of soiling – such as pollution, bird droppings or moss growth. The conclusion for all though is similar, as noted in the report.
“PV soiling will continue to be a global issue, which is expected to be exacerbated by climate change with rising global temperatures and subsequent droughts,” the researchers said. “Further advancements in soiling modelling, adaptation and mitigation are critically necessary.”
