The engine is based on a high-pressure, multi-point inlet air injection technology and low-inertia turbocharging. “Yuchai will use its extensive experience and advantages in the research and development of internal combustion engines to develop a solid process to transform hydrogen-powered engine [development] into large scale, mass production of these engines,” the company said. “The YCK05 hydrogen engines may be widely applicable in bus, municipal, sanitation, logistics and distribution markets.”
Lincoln, Nebraska-based hydrogen company Monolith has received conditional approval for a $1.04 billion (€918 million) loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. “Established via the Title XVII Innovative Energy Loan Guarantee Program, the loan will allow Monolith to expand its clean hydrogen and carbon black production facilities in Hallam, Nebraska,” wrote the company two days before Christmas. The loan guarantee program supports projects which feature new technology to avoid, reduce or sequester non naturally-occurring greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants.
French transport tech company Gaussin has announced a hydrogen vehicle partnership with Saudi energy company Aramco with the latter also sponsoring Gaussin’s H2 Racing Truck, the first hydrogen-powered truck to take part in the Dakar Rally, which is currently staged in Saudi Arabia. The truck started the race on Saturday. “It is already a victory in itself to have successfully built a vehicle in eight months,” said Gaussin CEO Christophe Gaussin. “And we are there to push the whole industry and show that the technology is there.” The chief executive described his company's vehicle as “the first racing hydrogen truck.” The company said the truck has two 450hp electric motors, four 100hp fuel cells, and 14 hydrogen tanks at 350 bar. Gaussin recently announced a partnership with Terminal du Grand Ouest – operator of the multipurpose cargo and container terminal near Saint-Nazaire in Montoir, France – to test a hydrogen-powered heavy handling tractor. “With a power of 230kW, the Gaussin APM H2 75T tractor will be able to tow 75 tons of goods and will consume about 10 kilos of hydrogen per day: a first on [French] national territory,” wrote the company in late December. Gaussin is also teaming up with Qatari companies to test its electric tractors.
French hydrogen production and distribution equipment company McPhy has been selected as preferred supplier for the GreenH2Atlantic project in Sines, Portugal. The project envisages a 100MW electrolysis plant which would convert green electricity into more than 41 tons of clean hydrogen daily. The electrolyzer would be made of scalable modules of up 8MW capacity each. “Heads of terms have been negotiated and [a] supply agreement [is] expected to be finalized during the first semester [of] 2022,” wrote McPhy at the end of the year. “The project aims to demonstrate the viability of green hydrogen on a scale of unprecedented production and technological application.” The project in Sines will be developed by 13 partners, including Portuguese utility EDP and compatriot energy company Galp; French utility Engie; Portuguese chemicals business Bondalti and compatriot construction group Martifer; Danish business Vestas Wind Systems A/S; and Portuguese energy and electric vehicle infrastructure player Efacec.
Australian fertilizer and chemical manufacturer Incitec Pivot and compatriot iron ore company Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) are negotiating an agreement to move forward a project to replace natural gas as a feedstock for ammonia production in Brisbane. Preliminary studies by the partners last year indicated the Gibson Island plant could be switched to green ammonia production and the companies want to produce a front-end engineering design study to “refine cost, schedule, permitting and commercial agreements, and inform a potential final investment decision,” Incitec said in mid December. The company said a water electrolysis plant could produce up to 50,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen annually, which would then be converted into more than 300,000 tonnes of green ammonia. At the end of December, Fortescue produced hydrogen using an electrolyzer designed and built by its team. “FFI has developed a number of new electrolyzer technologies that will form part of their electrolyzer patent family,” the Australian company wrote on December 20.
The first hydrogen vehicle from French brand Peugeot rolled off the production line in mid-December. “Peugeot becomes one of the very first manufacturers to offer, in addition to its combustion and battery electric versions, a hydrogen fuel cell powered version in the commercial vehicle segment,” wrote the company on its website. Franco-Italian-American parent company Stellantis is starting production of commercial hydrogen vans from its Citroen and Opel marques.
Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen said in her new year speech that within eight years Danish people must fly without causing emissions. “By 2025 at the latest, Danes must be able to fly green on a domestic route,” said the PM. “And by 2030, at the latest, we must be able to fly completely green when we fly domestically in Denmark.” Frederiksen, who said flying would become more expensive as a result, added the European Union should become a climate union. Denmark's hydrogen plans rest mainly on wind power generation.

Six module makers were selected as preferred bidders with JinkoSolar securing the largest order, for 1.85GW of panels, followed by Risen Energy and Canadian Solar, which secured 1.11GW and 740 MW, respectively. The other successful bidders were JA Solar, GCL Integration, and Longi, with orders for 400MW, 240MW and 160MW of products, respectively. According to PetroChina, the panels will have a power output ranging from 445-540W and will be used for solar farms planned in 24, mostly northern Chinese provinces. PetroChina had issued three sub-tenders in the exercise last month, for the northwest, northeast and north of the country, with capacities of 2.6GW, 1.1GW and 800MW, respectively.
PV module glassmaker Xinyi Solar has completed sale and purchase agreements over the last five days with related Xinyi businesses which will bring in up to RMB95.6 million (US$15 million) this year but commit it to spend up to RMB334 million (US$52.5 million), plus a further RMB15 million (US$2.36 million) annually for the next two years. The income relates to an agreement to supply up to 600,000 tons of silica sand this year to manufacturer Xinyi Glass, whose major shareholders also control Xinyi Solar. That arrangement, announced yesterday, will net Xinyi Solar up to RMB95.6 million, up from the RMB66.2 million (US$10.4 million) ceiling set last year. On the other side of the scale, Xinyi Solar agreed to buy up to 130,000 tons of low-iron silica suitable for use in solar panels from Xinyi Glass this year, with a ceiling value of up to RMB45.6 million (US$7.17 million). Xinyi Solar also, on Wednesday, agreed to pay Xinyi Glass subsidiary Wuhu Jisanshi up to RMB235 million (US$37 million) this year for production equipment, up from RMB232 million (US$36.5 million) last year, and will also spend up to RMB26.6 million (US$4.18 million) on up to 10,000 tons of Xinyi Glass float glass to be used for the rear of solar panels. In addition, Xinyi Solar will take up to 80,000m2 of Xinyi Glass architectural products for its buildings this year. The RMB38.2 million (US$6 million) total cap on those two agreements is less than a third of the RMB125 million (US$19.7 million) level set last year. Xinyi Solar also committed, on Friday, to pay the Xinyi Energy business up to RMB15 million this year, to manage its solar parks, with the same ceiling agreed for next year and 2024.
Slippers-to-air conditioning business Golden Solar on Thursday placed 50 million shares to raise an estimated net HK$498 million (US$63.9 million). The company, which is switching its focus to heterojunction (HJT) solar manufacturing, said it will spend HK$192 million (US$24.6 million) on raw materials and sub contracting fees to produce cast monosilicon wafers and solar modules. Some HK$75 million (US$9.62 million) will be spent on modifying casting silicon furnaces and HK$60 million (US$7.69 million) will be devoted to other “peripheral” production equipment. Golden Solar said HK$18 million (US$2.3 million) would fund production equipment for flexible solar modules and HK$3 million (US$385,000) would be spent on the associated raw materials. With the company having announced, on Wednesday, progress with four partners on a joint venture to develop an HJT cell production line in the Zhangjiakou Renewable Energy Pilot Zone, Golden Solar added it would devote HK$50 million (US$6.41 million) of the proceeds of the shares issue to fill a shortfall in the planned HK$120 million needed for equity investments to get partners on board with such projects. Golden Solar will hold a 51% stake in the JV, via solar manufacturer Gold Stone (Fujian) Energy Co Ltd which is a connected party to the investment vehicle which has signed up for 10 million of the new stock issued by the HJT maker. Public body the State Development and Investment Corp Power Holding Co Ltd will own 20% of the cell project with Hua Yuan Power Co Ltd holding the balance. The other project partners are the People’s Government of Zhangjiakou and Zhangjiakou Zhonghe New Energy Group Co Ltd. The cells to be made at the project will feature Golden Solar’s cast mono wafers. The other new investor in Golden Solar is Kwok Tai East International Group Ltd, which has signed up for 40 million of the stock placed.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/04/india-added-935mw-of-private-contract-backed-solar-in-first-nine-months-of-2021/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 4, 2022",India added 935MW of private-contract backed solar in first nine months of 2021,"From pv magazine India
The nine months to the end of September saw India install 935MW of open-access solar generation capacity – built by developers to meet the needs of private, usually corporate customers, with the electricity ‘wheeled' to clients via the state grid.
That figure, published today by U.S.-based analyst Mercom India Solar in its latest survey of the Indian open-access market, represented a 143% increase on the 385MW added in the same period a year earlier. It meant India reached a cumulative 4.8GW of open-access solar by the end of September, the analyst said.
The Mercom report stated India added 307MW of open-access solar capacity in the July-to-September period alone, to mark 85% year-over-year growth compared with the 166MW added in the same period of 2020. 
By the end of September, Mercom said, the development pipeline for open access projects stood at more than 1.1GW.
“The demand for procuring renewables in the open-access market is increasing every quarter, indicating the market’s high potential,” said Priya Sanjay, managing director at Mercom India. “Corporates are trying to match their power demands through renewable sources. Commercial and industrial (C&I) establishments across the board are sourcing solar through open access to meet their commitment to sourcing renewables and mitigating climate change.”
The report cited the power crisis triggered by depleting coal stocks at thermal power plants in the July to September window as a major wake-up call for commercial and industrial electricity users, who opted for alternative sources of power. Several states experienced power cuts from conventional sources, rendering open access solar generation more attractive.
The pace of open-access project development picked up after the second wave of Covid, according to the Mercom report. “However, the rising prices of [solar panel] raw materials, and thus [solar] components, have dampened the speed of installations,” stated the document. “The hike in goods and service tax (GST) is a major hurdle for the installers as it increases the overall project costs.”
During July to September, five States – Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Karnataka – accounted for around 96% of the overall 307MW of new open access solar capacity. Uttar Pradesh led, with around 35% of the segment, on the back of robust policy and a supporting regulatory framework, easy access to land, and efficient power evacuation facilities.
Tamil Nadu showed quarterly growth of more than 381% from the April-to-June period due to the state's favorable regulatory framework and tariff structure, the report stated.
Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Karnataka accounted for 11%, 10%, and 7%, respectively, of open access installations during July to September.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/04/heat-protective-film-to-reduce-solar-module-temperature-by-3-5-degrees-celsius/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA,MALAYSIA,RUSSIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 4, 2022",Heat-protective film to reduce solar module temperature by 3.5 degrees Celsius,"Scientists from South Ural State University (SUSU), in Russia, announced, in March, they had patented a new technology to prevent PV modules from overheating. The proposed technique consists of a holographic film based on prismatic concentrators known as “prismacons,” which are made of a transparent material containing holographic lenses of very small dimensions. It was claimed, at the time, to significantly reduce the operating temperature of solar panels, including thermal-photovoltaic devices, and to improve PV module efficiency even in cloudy weather.
A few months later, the same scientists, supported by other researchers from the Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP) and the Manipal Academy of Higher Education, in India, have developed a thermal model to assess the performance of the novel heat-protective film and decided to unveil more technical details on the film.
The research group explained that the holographic film, which can be simply laminated on the panel surface, works by reflecting the infrared rays from its metallized top layer, which prevents the module from overheating. Its core consists of a layer made with tiny mini pyramids/spectral concentrators that are able to absorb sunlight and refract it before directing it onto the solar cell due to internal reflection, regardless of the angle of incidence.
The technique was tested under standard illumination conditions on a 100W monocrystalline panel mounted with a tilt angle of 45 degrees and located in Qurghonteppa, in Tajikistan. The performance of a reference panel with the same characteristics, and without the holographic film, was also tested for comparison.
The operating temperature of the module with the film was found to be between 32 and 65 degrees Celsius, and that of the panel without the film to range from 35 to 75 degrees Celsius. “The silicon surface temperature reduction is 3.54 Celsius degrees, according to the data analyzed in this work,” the scientists stated. “According to simulation findings, even a small temperature difference of 3.54 Celsius degrees improves electric power generation performance significantly in larger solar systems under hot and warm climatic conditions.”
They explained, once again, that the sputtering of rare earth metals on the upper side of the holographic film is what makes it able to reflect and absorb the infrared radiation from the solar spectrum but they again did not specify which kind of rare earth metals were used.
The holographic film was described in the paper “Thermal model of a photovoltaic module with heat-protective film,” published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering. Looking forward, the research team said it wants to assess the costs of the new technique and to improve the thermal model to make it suitable to predict more accurately the temperature and power output of PV modules with filters in other climates.
Holographic films are very thin, flexible plastic films that can be laminated onto different types of materials. They can diffract the usable frequencies of sunlight and direct the generated energy toward solar cells. Their application in PV research is not new as several kinds of holographic foils and patterns have already been tested in both PV and CPV devices. However, the technology has not been developed for commercial production thus far.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/04/weathering-the-solar-industry-storm-how-growatt-overcame-2021s-challenges/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"JANUARY 4, 2022",Weathering the solar industry storm: How Growatt overcame 2021’s challenges,"
Lisa Zhang, global marketing director, Growatt: On the back of impressive global growth in the residential PV and energy storage markets, we saw a dramatic increase in sales in Europe and Latin America, etc. Our total revenues saw an over 60% increase compared to 2020.
The shortage of chips was unexpected and had a negative impact. We have thus had many discussions with leading global chip suppliers and have established strategic cooperations with them to ensure supply. We have also expanded our supplier base for other components with tests and verifications being completed to enhance our supply chain.
We think the situation will continue to be difficult and won't be completely resolved this year. The capacity expansion of chip manufacturers takes time, and therefore it’s difficult for the situation to improve until that expanded capacity comes online.
The storage sector is one of Growatt’s most important business sectors. On one hand, we have seen rapid growth in the renewable energy and Electric Vehicle (EV) markets around the world, which will push the development of energy storage. On the other hand, many countries have promulgated encouraging and supporting policies for energy storage. Another positive factor is the high residential electricity prices in western countries, and this also promotes the deployment of energy storage in residential solar systems.
Growatt is one of the earliest PV inverter producers and we first promoted our storage products back in 2015. Now we provide storage systems with DC- and AC-coupled solutions for residential and small commercial use. In 2021, we launched our “Battery Ready” system, and we allow our users to easily upgrade and install battery systems to establish safe, reliable, and efficient storage systems. Furthermore, our customers can build up their own home energy management systems to integrate solar PV, storage, electricity load, and EV chargers, etc.
By the end of 2021, we delivered around 3.7 million sets of our PV inverter and battery systems. Around one million active global users were connected to our cloud platform for daily operation and maintenance.
Presently about 75% of our revenue comes from overseas markets. We believe the Chinese PV market will continue to grow strongly, benefiting from the country’s ‘3060 Target’ and blanket rooftop solar program. This is good news for Growatt as we have strong competitive advantages in rooftop solar. Meanwhile, overseas solar PV and energy storage markets will continue to expand steadily, benefiting our sales growth and we expect our overseas revenue to continue taking a larger proportion.
The EU is our biggest overseas market, particularly in Holland, Italy, Germany, and other emerging EU markets. In Latin America, we have grown to be the number one brand in distributed generation in Brazil. And we have developed quickly in Australia and India.
We’ve been present in the United States since 2013 and we highly value this solar market. In 2021, Growatt launched the MIN 3000-11400TL-XH US inverter series, which can be coupled with our ARO storage battery for solar energy storage applications. We’ve also completed product tests and obtained product certifications for the market. In recent years, we’ve expanded our US team to serve American customers with dedicated local support. With continuing investments, we expect fast growth soon.
Our current production capacity located in Huizhou Guangdong Province, China, can meet our shipment expectations. At maximum, we can deliver an annual capacity of up to 20GW of PV inverters and 400,000 battery modules.
Our R&D work is focused on two aspects: the first is to track industry trends closely for product innovations and upgrades, and the second is to ensure our products meet different requirements from different markets around the world.
In 2022, Growatt will launch its first storage system for large commercial applications. We’re also developing solar inverters that can work better with high-power modules.
According to IHS Markit, the residential sector will expand steadily in 2022 while commercial solar will see an annual increase of over 8%. Overall, we expect distributed solar to keep its growth momentum next year, especially in Europe, Latin America, Australia, China, and India. We also see the market trend to integrate EV charging and battery storage with solar PV applications continue in 2022.

The two series were dubbed JW-HD156N and JW-HD108N and have a power output of up to 615 and 425W, respectively. “The first module was conceived for the C&I rooftop and utility scale segment to provide higher generation gains,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The second product has an all-black design and will be mainly used in residential rooftop projects.”
The JW-HD156N panel is available in six versions, with nominal power ranging from 590 to 615W and a front side power conversion efficiency of 21.11 to 22%. The open-circuit voltage spans from 54.1 to 55.1V and the short-circuit current from 13.8 to 14.1A.
The double-glass product has dimensions of 2,465×1,134x35mm and a weight of 34.5kg. It is fabricated with 2mm glass and an anodized aluminum frame. The module can operate with a system voltage of 1,500V and in temperatures ranging between -40 and 85 degrees Celsius. It features a temperature coefficient of -0.32% per degree Celsius.
The JW-HD108N module is sold with six different wattages, ranging from 405 to 425W and an efficiency spanning from 20.7% to 21.69%. This product can operate with a system voltage of 1,500V and has a power temperature coefficient of -0.32% per degree Celsius. The open-circuit voltage ranges from 37.3 to 38.3V and the short-circuit current is between 13.75 and 14.12A. It has a size of 1,728×1,134x30mm and weighs in at 24,5kg.
For both products, Jolywood offers a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee. Annual linear degradation over 30 years is indicated at 0.4% while degradation for the first year of the panel’s lifetime is capped at 1%.
Jolywood recently commissioned a 1.5GW TOPCon solar cell factory in Taizhou City, in China's Zhejiang province. “With this new manufacturing facility, our TOPCon solar cell production capacity has now reached 3.6GW,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. The other 2.1GW of capacity comes from another factory located in the Jiangsu province. “Our new production plant will produce cells based on larger wafers with a size of 182mm.”
In October, the company presented its bifacial 700W TOPCon solar module at Intersolar in Munich, Germany.
*The article was updated on January 5 to reflect that the output of the JW-HD108N module is 405-425 W, and that the product guarantee for both products is offered for 25 years.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/04/higher-pv-module-prices-may-point-to-stable-demand-and-more-sustainable-pricing-trends/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"JANUARY 4, 2022",Higher PV module prices may point to stable demand and more sustainable pricing trends,"The former Trina Solar Chief Scientist has been a forceful voice for the sustainability of PV cell and module materials as the industry grows towards gigawatt scale. Veteran solar researcher Pierre J Verlinden has pointed to silver and indium at the consumption levels in high-efficiency heterojunction cells.
Verlinden’s work on this issue has been advanced in additional work conducted by University of New South Wales (UNSW) researchers.
Additionally, he has argued that sustainability in solar pricing should be considered. He says that if race-to-the-bottom pricing prevails, PV cell and module makers will be unable to invest in R&D to advance PV technology, nor will they have the financial wherewithal to honor warranties.
So, with prices trending from US$0.21/Wp in 2020 up to US$0.33/Wp in 2021, as reported by Rystad Energy, does it make for more favorable market conditions and long-term business sustainability for PV cell and module manufacturers? Indeed, with the analyst predicting that module prices will surge to US$0.41/Wp in 2022 it could be argued that a new era of more sustainable pricing is emerging.
A closer look at PV cell and module costs, however, reveals that even with higher prices, margins may remain slim, with manufacturers continuing to be squeezed.
In November, Rystad Energy produced an analysis investigating price trends and cost drivers. It concluded that commodity prices across the board have been significantly driving up costs.

“For the modules some of the key ones, polysilicon, silver, copper, aluminum, and glass [which have gone up in cost],” said Dave Dixon, a senior analyst, renewables for Rystad Energy.
Further upstream, the news is worse. PV wafer and cell producers have had to grapple with the biggest cost increase, in the form of polysilicon – with prices surging throughout the year.
“Polysilicon just blows everything out the water,” says Dixon. The raw feedstock for crystalline silicon ingots and wafers increased by 175% in the first six months of 2021 alone. And while new capacity is set to come online, many see high prices continuing through at least the first half of 2022.
These developments are a particularly bitter pill for PV cell and module makers to swallow, as they have made impressive progress in driving manufacturing costs out of their operations.
“There are three key bars [of the chart above] that have come down rapidly – and that is module assemble, cell processing, and wafer processing,” said Dixon. “Module suppliers have done an excellent job in reducing their costs, also thrifting with their commodity inputs.
“We are now at a stage where manufacturing makes roughly 30% of module costs, while inputs comprise around 70% of the cost and those are out of control for the manufacturers,” he continues.
Given these dynamics, higher PV module prices primarily appear to be the result of surging commodity prices, polysilicon chief among them – far from a sustainable outcome.
A significant caveat to this analysis, however, is that end-market demand remains strong. Burgeoning PV rooftop demand, coupled with government and corporate efforts to decarbonize accelerating, market peaks, and troughs – the latter often the precursor to rapid price declines – appear to be a thing of the past.
Rystad expects some 270GW of renewable energy installations, across all technologies, to be achieved in 2022.

A consortium comprising South Korean rubber product and construction business Hi Korea Co Ltd and entities called Daihan Green Energy Co Ltd and Pabna Solar Power Ltd will jointly set up the plant on a build, own and operate basis on 182 acres of land.
The Bangladeshi government is set to buy electricity generated at the site for $0.1015/kWh under a 20-year deal.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
The prime minister’s office has indicated the development should go ahead under the Quick Enhancement of Electricity and Energy Supply (Special Provision) Act 2021.
Power division officials have said a site visit they carried out saw the original plans scaled back from the 100MW, 539 acres envisaged by the development partners, who wanted to sell their power for $0.1550/kWh. The power division's technical committee said the smaller plans would be more appropriate, considering factors including land acquisition and development permits, equipment transportation, and power evacuation infrastructure. The electricity tariff was subsequently revised down by a separate power division committee.
With officials estimating the government would pay $215 million over 20 years for clean electricity at the agreed tariff, the cabinet committee on government procurement will soon seek approval for the Bangladesh Power Development Board to sign the power purchase agreement.
The latest large scale solar plans come on the heels of the commissioning, at the end of the year, of the nation's largest solar plant to date, a 100MW array in southwestern Bangladesh.
The country now reportedly hosts 777.4MW of renewable energy generation capacity.

German heating, industrial, and refrigeration systems manufacturer Viessmann is testing the grid-integration of heat pumps in the service area of electricity transmission system operator 50 Hertz.
It is generally accepted heat pumps make a contribution to the energy transition as they generate CO2-free heat but they could also offer flexible capacity for network operators. Viessmann and network operator Tennet have been testing that theory since 2020 and their efforts have now been expanded to the area covered by 50 Hertz.
Viessmann will seek to determine flexible capacity possibilities via interfaces on heat pumps and heat storage systems, bundling them using the “ViShare Energy Community” and offering them to transmission system operators. The heat pump manufacturer promises anonymity and data protection-compliant transmission to the Equigy platform, from which network operators can seek grid capacity.
When determining possible capacity, care is taken to ensure temperatures in heat storage tanks and in rooms do not fall too low, and participating households will be rewarded for their flexible capacity. Viessmann collects a fee for the capacity offered and converts it to a heat electricity tariff which is several cents per kilowatt-hour less than the usual electricity price. The precise value depends on external factors such as the size and heating requirement of a household, which Viessmann asks when participants register for its “Viflex” tariff.
Viessmann is seeking participating households, especially in German states such as Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, Hesse, Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg.  A Viessmann heat pump is not a prerequisite for participation. All that is required is a heat electricity tariff tailored to the heat pump, according to the manufacturer.
The company's electricity prices recently hit the headlines thanks to a case in the Frankfurt am Main regional court. The consumer protection agency for North Rhine-Westphalia, Verbraucherschutz NRW, sued Viessmann for “misleading advertising claims” behind its tariffs. According to a regional court ruling made on December 21, Viessmann is not allowed to designate a “flat rate” electricity tariff as it is a volume tariff. However, the “Viflex” heat electricity tariff is not affected by that judgment.

The construction of the $1.87 billion project, which was implemented in two 1.8GW phases, was started by engineering company China Gezhouba Group Company Limited in 2014.
The facility consists of 12 reversible pump generating sets with a capacity of 300MW each and has a power generation capacity from storage of 6.612 billion kWh. It is connected to the Zhangbei VSC-HVDC power grid and the North China 500kV power grid, State Grid said in a statement.

According to the company, the pumped-hydro station will operate as a peaking power plant for the safe and stable operation of the grid by balancing the intermittent power supply from large wind and solar parks located in northern Hebei and Inner Mongolia.
State Grid chairman, Xin Baoan, stressed this is the first time in China that a pumped-hydro storage plant has been connected to a flexible DC network.
According to the National Energy Administration, China is targeting 62GW of operational pumped-hydro facilities by 2025 and 120GW by 2030. Currently, it has 30.3GW of operational pumped-hydro stations, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.
*The article was amended on January 5 to reflect that 6.612 billion kWh is the facility's power generation capacity from storage, and not its storage capacity, as we previously reported.

The draft is prepared every year by the Serbian Ministry of Finance for the European Union’s scrutiny and as part of the country’s laborious path to joining the bloc.
As part of €17 billion ($19.2 billion) of investment for the energy and mining sector, €12 billion will be set aside for wind farms, PV plants and hydropower facilities. Utility-scale PV projects could be built on 200,000 hectares of neglected, low-value agricultural land that could host 2GW of solar, according to the draft. As part of the plan, a cooperation agreement was signed in August 2021 between the Serbian Ministry of Mining and Energy and Chicago-based UGT Renewables for the construction of 1GW of solar spanning more than 2,000 hectares across a dozen locations.
The draft also envisages the construction of around 300MW of PV plants, valued at €200 million, on land owned by state-owned power utility EPS, primarily on its coal ash dumps. Last year, the utility announced a tender to analyze conditions for the construction of two solar power plants with a capacity of 9.9MW each on the ash dumps of TPPs Morava and Kolubara. EPS has previously unveiled plans to build a 9.95MW solar array on the landfill site of the former Cirkovac Mine and a 97.2MW PV plant on an existing ash and slag dump owned by Srednje Kostlačko Ostrvo. However, little progress has been made on these projects, even though they have been discussed for a long time.
Most of the solar capacity envisaged under the 2022-24 draft is supposed to come from rooftop PV. Last year, Serbia started promoting prosumer concepts and identified 600 square kilometers of rooftops as suitable for the installation of solar panels. According to the draft, installing PV on 10% of those surfaces would equate to 6GW of installed capacity and an annual output of 7TWh, which is around 20% of the total energy production in the country. The total installed capacity of state-owned projects would thus amount to 8.3GW deployed to the tune of EUR6.2 billion, the draft states.
Too high?
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Serbia had an installed PV capacity of 29MW at the end of 2020. Around 10 MW of this installed power comes from an expired feed-in tariff scheme, which granted rates ranging from €0.124 to €0.146/kWh for rooftop PV arrays, depending on system size, and €0.09/kWh for ground-mounted installations, all under 12-year power purchase agreements.
“The solar sector in Serbia has been a major failure so far,” Marijan Rancic, director of business development at New Energy Solutions and a member of the Association of Renewable Energy Sources of Serbia, told pv magazine. He pointed to the onerous red tape around rooftop PV and a lack of access to financing.
Last year, Serbia introduced the much-anticipated Law on the Use of Renewable Energy Sources, the country's first such law intended to facilitate deployment of renewables in the country. The law envisages market premiums awarded in auctions and feed-in tariffs only for some small projects (such as those with a capacity below 500 kW and below 3MW for wind projects) and demonstration projects, and introduces the long-awaited legal framework for prosumers.
To take advantage of the net metering regime, which will allow households and businesses to sell excess power to the state utility EPS, Serbia announced rebates last August, covering up to 50% of the cost of installing and deploying rooftop PV. Under the new regulations, EPS will be compelled to connect a PV system within five days after its owner has secured connection approval.
“We expect that in the next few years we will have a rooftop PV boom as the prosumer model becomes more simplified in practice,” Rancic said, adding that this applies particularly to the C&I market segment. “This will move the needle and permanently reshape the energy sector in Serbia in favor of solar.”
On the utility-scale front, however, things do not look so bright.
“Although there appears to be more predictability in the primary legislation than it used to be in the past, in terms of balancing responsibility for the utility-scale solar projects there is still some work ahead of us that will determine bankability of the future framework,” Rancic said, pointing to the use of agricultural land and grid issues as the main obstacles to PV deployment.

GameChange Solar, a provider of racking and trackers for utility-scale and commercial solar projects, has announced a $150 million investment from Koch Strategic Platforms (KSP), a subsidiary of Koch Investments Group.
The preferred stock investment, if converted, would represent a minority stake in GameChange. In addition to capital investment, Koch and GameChange are exploring further synergies across Koch Industries, including Koch Engineered Solutions and KBX, a transport logistics unit.
GameChange Solar has demonstrated steady growth since it was established in 2012 and is currently ranked the third-largest solar tracker company in the United States, and sixth globally in 2020 by Wood Mackenzie.
KSP’s strategy diverged from Koch Industries historic resistance to the proliferation of solar. In 2016, Koch-backed groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council led state-level policy fights against PV. In Arizona, Nevada, and especially Florida, the group had success in pushing rate hikes and fees for residential solar customers.
Now, KSP said it is focused on energy transformations as one of its core verticals, making investments in in companies met with strong tailwinds that are disrupting the industry. Recently, the investment arm announced investments in the battery value chain, energy storage, and infrastructure.
GameChange and KSP said the investment will fuel further develop margin-enhancing balance of system solutions, including a new 2P tracker technology, a fixed-tilt system, and advanced tracker software.
Citi acted as sole placement agent and strategic adviser, and Goodwin Procter served as legal counsel to GameChange. Jones Day acted as legal counsel to Koch.

Bluetti, a Las Vegas-based manufacturer of solar energy facilities, PV generators, solar panels, and other solar peripherals, has launched a sodium-ion solar generator, the NA300, and a compatible battery module, the B480.
Bluetti said its first-generation sodium-ion battery excels in thermal stability, fast-charging capacity, low-temperature performance, and integration efficiency, despite slightly lower energy density than its lithium-ion counterparts. The solar generator and battery’s chemical components also feature more abundant materials than traditional lithium-ion batteries, lowering prices and alleviating concerns about resource scarcity.
The sodium-ion power station comes with four 20-amp traditional wall plugs, as well as a 30-amp L14-30 output port, driven by the system’s built-in 3000W pure sine wave inverter.
Thermal stability has become a hallmark issue of lithium-ion batteries, ever since the Arizona Public Service battery failure and corresponding explosion that left eight firefighters and one police officer hospitalized in Surprise, Arizona, in April 2019.
According to Bluetti, the system can charge to 80% state-of-charge in less than 30 minutes at room temperature. In a low-temperature environment of -20 C, it has an 85% capacity retention rate and 80% system integration efficiency.
BloombergNEF recently updated its technology outlook to include sodium-ion batteries. It said could play a “meaningful role” in the greater storage landscape by 2030.
Bluetti plans to officially debut the NA300 & B480 Sodium-ion Battery Power station at CES 2022 on Jan. 5 in Las Vegas, Nevada.
