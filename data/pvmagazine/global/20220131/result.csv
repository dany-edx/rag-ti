German engineering, procurement and construction services company Belectric, which German utility RWE recently agreed to sell to Czech power utility CEZ Group, is set to begin construction on a 16.8 MW floating solar plant on a water reservoir near Kibbutz Ma'ayan Tzvi in the north of Israel.
The plant will be the fourth floating project built by Belectric in the country and the first for local energy company S'Energy. “Each of the more than 30,000 PV modules will be individually mounted on a floating platform,” Belectric said in a statement. “The PV system is connected to the mainland via floating marine grade power lines. The floating platform itself is held in place by an anchoring and mooring system with direct rammed piers.”
Last year, Belectric announced the start of construction for a 19.3 MW floating photovoltaic system it is still building for French energy giant EDF. In March 2020 it completed a 480 kW floating PV plant for Israeli energy business Nofar Energy.
Belectric Israel Ltd. has built 35 solar projects with a total capacity of around 570 MW in Israel, including the country's largest solar facility — the 120 MW Zeélim solar park, near the village of the same name in southern Israel.
“This is already the fourth floating PV project we are realizing for customers in Israel,” said Anna Velikansky, managing director of Belectric's Israeli unit. “The greatest advantage of floating solar is that it reduces land utilization and site preparation issues associated with traditional solar installations. An additional benefit is that the water cools the panels naturally, which should increase their efficiency.”

Enel X, the advanced energy services arm of Italian energy company Enel, has switched on a 100% electric multipurpose recharging station for electric vehicles in Santiago, Chile.
Located next to the Enea Business Park in the district of Pudahuel, near Santiago International Airport, the station has 23 charging points to supply electricity to different vehicles. The station is seen as a potential a solution to the current problem of conventional fossil fuel distribution service stations, where single electric chargers generate lines and long waits. According to the company, buses, trucks, last-mile vehicles, taxi fleets and private cars will be able to recharge electricity quickly, simultaneously and continuously 24 hours a day.
The canopies that cover the different charging points are equipped with 36 photovoltaic panels with a power generation capacity of 16.2 kWh.
The station has 20 fast and ultra-fast chargers with a power of 50 and 150 kW, respectively, which will allow all types of vehicles to be optimally and flexibly charged in up to 10 minutes, Enel X stated. In addition, it will have another three 22 kW units to recharge cars in six hours, taking advantage of the nightly charging time for fleet vehicles.
The chargers will be online through the JuicePass application, a digital platform that provides access to one of the largest public recharging networks in the country and makes it possible to manage the supply of electric vehicles, locate the nearest supplier, reserve it and monitor the load level in real-time, among other benefits.
The station has multi-standard charging points equipped with complete smart grid integration, power adaptation and mobile connectivity that allows remote control and maintenance. Additionally, the equipment is compatible with the main vehicle charging standards currently on the market.
The new station joins ElectroRuta Enel X, the most ambitious electromobility project in Latin America that the company presented at the beginning of 2020, and which includes the installation of 1,200 charging points throughout Chile. To date, Enel X has installed more than 320 charging points in Santiago and different regions of the country.
Enel X charging points are being strategically implemented on motorways, highways, in various types of industry, including mining and the real estate sector, universities and restaurants.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/31/portuguese-solar-plants-tendered-and-merchant-remain-in-limbo/,"COVID-19,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,PORTUGAL",ILIAS TSAGAS,"JANUARY 31, 2022",Portuguese solar plants – tendered and merchant – remain in limbo,"Portuguese government advisory body and permitting authority the Direção Geral de Energia e Geologia (DGEG) has extended the deadline for developers who secured solar project capacity in national tenders in 2019 and 2020 to bring their sites to fruition.
Previously, national tender program rules stipulated developers would have to secure generation licenses within 18 months for project sites subject to environmental impact assessments, and within a year for facilities that did not require such permits. Those grace periods have now been extended to 37 and 27 months, respectively, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the DGEG said last week.
The tenders held in 2019 and 2020 appeared to set new world records for the low price fixed for the solar-powered electricity generated at the most competitive sites, although there was some dispute about whether the tariffs generated accurately reflected how all the energy concerned would be sold.
The 2019 exercise set a low of $0.016/kWh (€0.01435 at today's exchange rate) and that benchmark fell to $0.01316/kWh (€0.01180) the following year but few of those solar projects have actually been installed yet, with construction yet to begin on the vast majority of the 1.15GW of generation capacity allocated in 2019 and the 670MW earmarked in 2020.
Some of the 2020 projects are still in the process of land acquisition while others are beginning their environmental impact assessments.
The new, centre-left Socialist Party government of António Costa – which secured an unexpected parliamentary majority yesterday in a snap election called after the previous left-wing coalition it had led collapsed – is set to oversee a floating solar tender in the spring.
João Garrido, founder and manager of Lisbon-based utility scale solar consultant Caparica Solaris, told pv magazine the pandemic was not the only reason for delays in solar plant construction.
The consultant pointed to “climbing prices of … equipment (e.g. panels, cables etc) and the fact that some investors are locked in contracts with very low [solar electricity price] tariffs. One should note that some projects are locked into tariffs [of] around $22/MWh [$0.022/€0.01973 per kilowatt-hour] and the market [wholesale electricity] price at present is above $220/MWh.”
With the large scale solar capacity driven by national tenders slow to take shape, the “merchant solar” route to market – where solar fields are developed without government support, to sell direct to electricity consumers which sign power purchase agreements – is still blocked by the refusal of the DGEG to process a mountain of applications.
A previous Costa-led government had, in 2019, attempted to define a policy framework for merchant renewables facilities but the apparently loosely-written nature of that permitting regime prompted a flood of applications for a mammoth 253GW of generation capacity, most of it solar, by Feb. 2020.
An overwhelmed DGEG halted the processing of merchant solar project applications in March 2020, stating it was doing so as a safety measure to halt the spread of Covid-19. That stop – which does not apply to self-consumption, pilot plants, or hydrogen projects – was this month extended through March and the prospect of merchant solar applications starting to be processed from April appears slim after the DGEG said it was reconsidering the criteria which should be applied to such generation sites. The government body said it was doing so in “the context of high prices for natural gas, which impacts the price of electricity [and] reinforces the need to invest in the transition to a more sustainable energy model based on renewable energies.”
Solar consultant Garrido said the frequently-changing nature of the proposed merchant solar rules is leading to uncertainty and chaotic licensing rather than a clear regulatory landscape.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/31/the-panel-and-the-city/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 31, 2022",The panel and the city,"Scientists from Arizona State University in the United States have conducted research to evaluate how urban settings affects the performance of PV systems and, conversely, how PV systems affect their surrounding urban environment.
The researchers explained that solar modules are sources of radiative heat for all structures beneath them and, at the same time, are convective heat sources that can considerably increase the temperature of the ambient air in cities, contributing to the so-called urban heat island (UHI) effect, which occurs when cities absorb and retain heat, due to a high concentration of pavements, buildings, and other surfaces.
Their analysis was based on a review conducted on 116 scientific articles for review, through which seven different types of PV-urban climate interactions were identified. For the impact of the urban environment on the PV system, it considered urban air temperature, urban air pollution, the partial shading of the PV system, and soiling. To evaluate how the solar array affects the urban environment, it took into account urban air temperatures, building heating and cooling loads, and outdoor shade.
Impact of urban environment
The scientists found that all analyzed parameters have a “non-trivial role” in affecting PV power generation, although the impact of the elevated temperatures caused by the UHI is difficult to quantify, as it varies seasonally and diurnally.
Air pollution was described as one of the main factors reducing PV performance in urban environments, with power yield spanning from 5 to 15%. “Particle deposition on PV panels results in absorption and backscattering of insolation, reducing the transmittance of the panel surface,” the academics explained. “While this effect is most notable in highly polluted urban environs, it can also manifest itself in rural installations downwind of urban and industrial pollution sources.”

As for the effect of soiling, the scientists said that cities often have impervious surfaces such as roads, parking lots, and buildings, which are not detrimental to PV power generation, as these are less prone to high atmospheric loading of particulates from soils. “Nevertheless, other sources of soiling in urban environments, including soot from vehicles and industry and dust from construction activities may significantly contribute to soiling of PV,” they further explained. “However, research suggests that periodic cleaning of PV surfaces, either from precipitation or from routine maintenance can maintain the generation penalty of soiling at less than 10%.”
The shading effect, which for PV systems in urban environments is often unavoidable, is described in the study as the most significant issue affecting PV system performance in dense urban areas. “The average effects of this penalty can be on the order of 20%,” the researchers emphasized. “However, careful design of urban installations, accounting for current, and potential future shading, can greatly reduce this issue.”
Impact of photovoltaics
The analysis of how PV impacts the urban environment showed conflicting results and highlighted the need for further studies, although it confirmed that solar panels have an influence on urban energy balance and affect urban air temperatures.
Their thermal and electrical characteristics are key parameters to assess this influence. The shadow that the panels can produce on the surrounding areas and air gap between the panels and the surface beneath them, which results in convective heat transfer from both surfaces of the PV panel to the air, were identified as two main factors increasing air temperature. “Further controlled empirical studies and validated modeling efforts are needed, particularly because the conflicting studies differ not simply in magnitude of their projections, but in terms of the sign of the anticipated impact of PV on air temperatures,” they further explained.
Their analysis also showed that current scientific literature is also divided on how rooftop PV positively affects the energy performance of buildings by reducing the need for cooling at night, taking into account that solar panels can cool down faster than the roof cover or other architectural elements. “The magnitude of this savings depends significantly on the assumption of the albedo of the roof surface being shaded, the level of building insulation, and other building construction and operation characteristics,” the also stated.
Their findings were presented in the paper “Photovoltaics in the built environment: A critical review,” published in Energy and Buildings.
“As our synthesis suggests, photovoltaics in urban settings offer many benefits, but also are fraught with challenges — both in terms of how the urban environment affects their performance and how they can adversely affect the urban environment and energy consumption for air conditioning,” they concluded. “These complexities are often difficult to convey to the general public or to local/regional decision-makers who are typically seeking simplified summaries regarding the evaluation of technologies.”

The Peruvian government will offer around 2 GW of renewable energy capacity in two different auctions this year, the country's minister of energy and mines, Eduardo González, announced Friday.
The two procurement exercises are expected to mobilize around $2 billion in new investments, González said, without providing further details. “We are going to be able to lower energy prices and take that difference to the most humble homes,” he stated during a press conference.
Peru held its last and fourth renewable energy auction in 2016, when it awarded 185 MW of solar PV projects at an average price of US$48/MWhE, with the winners being Enel Green Power Peru and Enersur. Enel won a contract to supply 415 GWh annually at a price of $47.98/MWh, which it covered with its 144 MW Rubí PV project, and Enersur was awarded a contract to supply 108 GWh annually at a price of $48.50/MWh, which it met with its 40 MW Intipampa PV project.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Peru had an installed capacity of 331 MW at the end of 2020, most of which was deployed before 2017.

The project, in Southern Africa, was among the examples cited by the trade body as evidence of a strong large scale solar pipeline on the continent when AFSIA chief executive John van Zuylen hosted a webinar on Thursday to present the organization's annual report for 2021.
Van Zuylen also pointed to the launch of a 1GW solar project in Algeria last year, which is set for development this year, and to plans for five projects in South Africa with a total generation capacity of 975MW.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
The chief executive said the share of new global solar capacity claimed by Africa last year fell to just 0.5%, from 3.1% three years earlier, but highlighted encouraging developments in the commercial and industrial, mini-grid, and solar home system (SHS) segments of the market.
Kenya is leading the charge in the, typically single-panel SHS household solar market, at the head of strong East African regional activity but West Africa also recorded strong figures last year, according to AFSIA, with 20 million SHS units operating in Africa in 2021, to the benefit of 100 million people.
Although the size of the systems sold was smaller than in the previous year, more units were shifted and there was increasing adoption of such small scale solutions to power irrigation and cold storage, according to the trade body's annual report.
While pv magazine has previously highlighted the effect of more expensive solar equipment on the African market, cheaper energy storage technology and the freer availability of finance helped fire a booming commercial and industrial solar market last year, according to AFSIA.
Uganda, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria boasted strong mini-grid markets in 2021, even if only 49MWp of generation capacity was provided by such off-grid networks across the continent during the last 12 months. AFSIA pointed out there is still a gap between project announcements and delivery and added only around 30% of the mini-grid projects announced in 2020 materialized.
The solar industry membership body reiterated the suggestion Africa should consider harnessing the green hydrogen output which could be offered by the rich renewables potential of countries such as Algeria, Namibia, and South Africa to establish domestic ammonia and fertilizer industries, rather than just preparing to export the clean hydrogen used to manufacture such commodities.
In terms of the outlook for solar in Africa this year, AFSIA chief executive Van Zuylen highlighted the growing demand for PV from mining and telecoms businesses in the continent, and pointed to better enabling legislation which is expected, such as streamlined permitting rules in South Africa.
The headline to this story and the copy were amended on 01/02/22 to indicate the green hydrogen project referred to is being planned by Namibia and Botswana, not by Namibia and Angola, as previously stated.

Germany’s Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has reported that 421 MW of new PV was installed in the country in December.
For comparison, the newly installed PV capacity for December 2020 was 525 MW, and in November 2021 it was 410 MW.
In 2021, new PV additions reached 5.26 GW, which means that the country saw its installed PV power increase by around 0.34 GW more than in 2020, when annual PV additions hit 4.88 GW.
In 2019, 2018, and 2017, new capacity totaled 3.94, 2.96 GW and 1.75 GW, respectively.
At the end of the year, Germany boasted a cumulative 56.3 GW of grid-connected solar, installed under national Renewable Energy Sources Act.
As a result of the strong growth registered in the past months, all the FITs for PV installations will be reduced by another 1.4%, and will range from €0.0653 to €0.0496/kWh, depending on the system size.

The Silk Premium module features 120 PERC cells with a size of 210 mm, multi-busbar, and a 1/3 cut design. It is available in five versions, with nominal power ranging from 390 to 410 W and a power conversion efficiency of 20.25 to 21.20%. The open-circuit voltage spans from 40.7 to 41.7V and the short-circuit current from 12.18 to 12.46A.
The new product measures 1754x1098x30 mm and weighs in at 21 kg. It is fabricated with 3.2mm glass and an anodized aluminum frame with mounting and drainage holes. The module can operate with a system voltage of 1,000V and temperatures ranging between -40 and 85 degrees Celsius. It features a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius.
The product, which comes with a 15-year warranty and 25-year performance guarantee, is also said to show a maximum output drop of 0.5% per year, with around 87% of output expected at the end of the 25th year of operation.
“The larger 1/3 cut cell reduces the operating current and internal resistance, improving the overall yield. As a result, the cell undergoes less mechanical stress, further reducing micro crack and hotspot risks, which are likely to occur when the PV panel is operating,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “Moreover, the new Premium range reduces the space between cells from 2 mm to 0.8 mm, thanks to the high-density cell connection technology.”
The company is headquartered in Cittadella, in the Padua province of northern Italy, and operates two solar modules factories totaling 1 GW in China. Its Italian staff focus on R&D in areas such as interdigitated back-contact (IBC) cells, cylindrical ribbons, glass-glass solutions and modules with independent sections.

They explained that a solar system's ramp rate may have a negative impact on the lifetimes of household appliances and grid stability. “The redox flow battery technology has advantages in the decoupling of power and energy ratios, large cycle life, low maintenance, and limited self-discharge,” they explained. “As for disadvantages, it has a low power density.”
“The vanadium redox flow battery technology can be upscaled up to any capacity, as it can be designed with independent power and energy requirements, an advantage over lithium-ion technology,” the research project's corresponding author, Ana Catarina Foles, told pv magazine. “The sizing of a battery for this purpose of self-consumption and control of power ramps must be done taking into account the load profile, the characteristics of the solar photovoltaic system, such as installed power, inclination, and orientation, among others, as well as the site characteristics, such as solar radiation, meteorology, and limits imposed by law or regulation on power ramps or grid integration.”
The 5 kW/60 kWh battery was connected to a rooftop PV system with an MPPT inverter capable of receiving power commands in real-time. The battery operates through three inverters synchronized to the local three-phase grid. It was built with two electrolyte tanks containing a mixture of vanadium ions and sulfuric acid, two pumps for electrolyte flowing, and a stack as the energy conversion unit. The latter was fabricated with 40 cells electrically connected in series, and hydraulically connected in parallel.
The battery was provided by UK-based redT energy, which was recently renamed Invinity. The device has a rated capacity of 60 kWh,  an operating voltage of up to 60 V, and a capacity of 1.8 cubic meters for each tank. “The rated capacity of this battery is used to its fullest, without causing any degradation of its capacity, lifetime or performance,” Foles explained. “The technology type is very tolerable to over-discharge, and overcharge avoidance is achieved through the open-circuit voltage reference control outside the stack. Vanadium ions exist in both electrolyte tanks and crossover through the membrane stack does not lead to contamination.”
The VRFB is also equipped with a reference cell, which is hydraulically connected in parallel with the stack, subjected to the same electrolyte flow, without being subjected to charge or discharge voltage, and allows to make direct real-time voltage measurements.
The storage device was tested to control the ramp rate of a 6.7 kW building-integrated PV microgrid installed at the university campus.  The simulation was performed to analyze how the battery balances the system load to ensure firm power output at the load.  Three different strategies were applied: maximization of self-consumption; maximization of self-consumption with ramp-rate control; and self-consumption maximization with ramp-rate control and battery charging based on weather forecasts. Accordingly, three different algorithms were developed using Matlab software.
“The inputs of the simulation model include the constraints details of the UÉvora microgrid, the PV generation and load profiles, the developed VRFB electrical model, and the ramp rate calculus and its premises,” the academics specified, noting that the VRFB architecture may be reproduced in similar projects, with the increased advantage of being an easily scalable product.
Through their measurements, the Portuguese scientists found that approximately 5% of the PV power ramps that occurred were above the rate of 10%/min of the PV nameplate capacity and that the first strategy performs only a self-consumption maximization without any form of ramp rate control. The second strategy, by contrast, was able to perform ramp rate control by imposing a 10 %/min of the PV nameplate capacity ramp rate limit, while also providing additional stability over the grid energy exchange.
As for the third strategy, it was not only able to perform ramp rate control and maximize self-consumption but was also capable of implementing an SoC control to prepare the battery to better deal with the next–day PV power ramps. “This strategy demonstrated to be able to control 100% of the ramps with rates above 10%/min, maintaining the self-consumption ratio of the PV system at around 61%,” the scientists affirmed.
“The VRFB can be used in different energy management strategy scenarios, and to better complement the solar photovoltaic generation,” Foles emphasized. “In this study, we show that for the goal, which is to control PV power ramps, and given the profiles understudy, more gains are achieved if applied with the third strategy. However, VRFB can be used with the first and the second strategy if the goals are distinct. VRFB technology is a promising energy storage technology for building integration, and this work proves successful results on its real operation implementation.”
The research's findings can be found in the paper “An approach to implement photovoltaic self-consumption and ramp-rate control algorithm with a vanadium redox flow battery day-to-day forecast charging,” published in Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks.

“The new technique allows a reduction in the use of toxic solvents and the concentration of lead in the precursors,” the research's corresponding author, Aldo di Carlo, told pv magazine.  “These key elements may facilitate the transfer of the perovskite solar cell technology to commercial production.”
The module was fabricated with methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite solar cells via low-cost spin coating, which applies a uniform film onto a solid surface using centrifugal force and a liquid-vapor interface.
This technique is commonly thought not to be suitable to produce perovskite photovoltaics on industrial-scale substrates in a material-efficient way because of the nature of both spin coating and perovskites. “Our approach tackles this challenge by introducing a co-solvent that allows the liquid perovskite to spread evenly and dry very quickly and uniformly,” said co-author Hong Zhang, referring to the irregular thickness formed on the perovskite surface when the spin coating is applied.
As a co-solvent, the academics used an organic compound known as Tetrahydrofuran (THF). The cell achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 23.8%. “To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency obtained at such a dilute concentration of the perovskite precursor,” the scientists explained.
The module developed with this solar cell technology reached an efficiency of 18.45%, an open-circuit voltage of 16.07 V, a short-circuit current of 69.52 mA, and a fill factor of 75.35%.
“Encouragingly, our co-solvent dilution strategy allows using less than 80% of the starting perovskite material and toxic solvents to fabricate lab-scale devices with similar high performance, which inspired us to validate our strategy on large-scale module fabrication using industrial spin-coating approaches commonly available in a semiconductor fab,” the research team stated.
All the details of the new technique can be found in the paper A universal co-solvent dilution strategy enables facile and cost-effective fabrication of perovskite photovoltaics, published in nature communications.

Australia’s largest planned Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) is to be built in the New South Wales (NSW) northeast with the state government announcing the New England REZ, which will deliver at least 8 GW of new network capacity, has been formally declared.
The declaration of the New England REZ is the first step in formalising the coordinated energy zone under the Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act 2020. It sets out the intended network capacity, geographical area and infrastructure that will make up the New England REZ which is centred on the northern city of Armidale and extends west towards Uralla and east to Ebor and takes in Walcha to the south and Glenn Innes to the north.
Energy Corporation of NSW chief executive officer James Hay said the state government is powering ahead and meeting major milestones on its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap with this REZ, which follows the declaration of the Central-West Orana REZ in November.
“REZs are the modern-day equivalent of a power station, combining low-cost renewables with back-up energy from storage and transmission to deliver cheap, reliable and clean energy,” he said.
“It’s phenomenal to get this REZ declared as New England has some of the best natural energy resources in the country, including some of the state’s best potential sites for pumped-hydro and strong investor interest.”
Energy Minister Matt Kean said the 8 GW New England REZ is the biggest commitment to cheap, clean energy in the state’s history with the NSW Government committing to invest $78.9 million to support its development.
“The New England REZ is a fundamental part of our Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap and we expect it will deliver up to 8,000 megawatts of new capacity, $10.7 billion in private investment, around 830 operational jobs and 1,250 construction jobs to the local economy,” he said in a statement.
“The New England REZ will be able to power 3.5 million homes and, when coupled with Central-West Orana REZ, sets the state up to become the number one destination across Australia for renewable energy investment.”
The New England REZ is set to become the nation’s largest energy zone with a call for registrations of interest (ROI) last year attracting more than 80 new solar, wind and energy storage projects, totalling a massive 34 GW.
Kean said the response to the ROI process showed huge investor confidence in the state’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap with more than four times the level of interest needed to build out the planned 8 GW REZ.
“The overwhelming response shows this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to attract enormous investment into regional areas, cementing NSW’s renewable energy future,” he said.
The New England region has already attracted a host of large-scale wind and solar projects, including the Walcha Energy Project, a 4 GW wind, solar and pumped hydro energy storage hub put forward by Energy Estate and its partners.

Joint venture UPC/AC Renewables Australia has commenced construction of the first 400 MW stage of the New England Solar Farm while Spanish developer Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) is progressing with the 115 MW Metz Solar Farm.
The state-owned Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo) has been appointed as the infrastructure planner for the New England REZ and will coordinate the generation, firming, storage and transmission projects leading the delivery of the state’s REZs.
Hay said EnergyCo has and will continue to work with a range of stakeholders in the New England region to deliver the REZ in a way that considers local priorities and values, land use planning, investor interest and the legislative requirements.
“This is great news for the region as the REZ will help drought-proof traditional farming communities and provide new income streams for landholders that host electricity infrastructure,” he said.
“It is estimated that in the New England REZ, this could amount to around $660 million in lease payments for landholders to 2042.
“REZs will also play a key role in delivering on our commitment to halve the state’s emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050.”

The New England REZ is one of five designated clean energy areas detailed in the NSW Government’s electricity roadmap, which is anticipated will support more than $32 billion of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state.
REZs will also be developed in the Central-West Orana, South-West, Hunter-Central Coast and Illawarra regions and are expected to bring 12 GW of renewable energy and 2 GW of storage online ahead of the planned retirement of the coal-reliant state’s aging thermal-generation fleet with four of its five fossil-fuelled power plants expected to close in the next 15 years, starting with Liddell in 2023-24.
The Central-West Orana REZ, which is tipped to deliver 3 GW of renewable energy, was the first of the REZs to be launched with the call for ROIs last year attracting 113 registrations, totalling 27 GW and valued at $38 billion.
The state government has also invited ROIs from renewable generators, energy storage and network developers, and existing and proposed energy loads, to participate in shaping the South-West REZ, which is centred on the inland town of Hay and extends west to Buronga and east to the fringes of Griffith.
The New England REZ will be built in stages, with the delivery timetable to be developed throughout the planning process.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/31/italy-allocates-710-mw-of-solar-in-seventh-renewables-auction/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 31, 2022",Italy allocates 710 MW of solar in seventh renewables auction,"Italian energy agency the Gestore dei Servizi Energetici (GSE) allocated 974.9 MW of renewable energy capacity in the country's seventh clean energy auction for projects with capacities above 1 MW.
The GSE awarded 710.2 MW of solar capacity across 60 locations. Of these projects, 49 will have a capacity of less than 10 MW and the remaining 11 projects will range in size from 13.2 MW to 92.4 MW.
Among the selected bidders for the solar plants, there are well-known companies such as German developer Juwi, Italian energy companies ERG and Enel, and Portuguese utility EDP. Other bidders are special purpose vehicles that are not immediately attributable to industry players.
Wind power was not the leading source for the second time in a row, with 264.7 MW allocated across 18 sites.
All developers offered a maximum discount ranging from 2-3.5% from the auction ceiling price of €0.065/kWh. The lowest bid came in at €0.06263/kWh and was offered for a 5.9 MW solar project located in the province of Perugia, in the Italian central region of Umbria. The highest bid of €0.0637/kWh was submitted for an 8.4 MW wind farm in Cosenza, in the southern region of Calabria, and a 5.0 MW solar park in Forlì, in the northern region of Emilia Romagna.
The bids in the latest procurement exercise were slightly lower than those in the sixth renewable energy auction, in which discounts ranged from 2.0 to 2.06% and ceiling price was still €0.070/kWh as in all previous auctions, and considerably higher than those in the first auction, in which discounts ranged from 2.29. to 20.0%.
In the sixth auction, held in September, the Italian authorities allocated 297 MW of installed solar power, with bids ranging from €0.0686/kWh to €0.0646/kWh. In the fifth procurement exercise, finalized in May, the lowest bid came in at €0.0685/kWh and was submitted for a 3.4 MW solar project. Overall, only 32 MW of solar were allocated. In the fourth round of the tender scheme, solar secured 20 MW and the lowest bid was €0.06819/kWh.
In the third renewables auction, held in October, the GSE had assigned 95.5 MW of solar capacity across four locations. The lowest bid – submitted for a PV project – was €0.06490/kWh. In the second renewables auction, only 19.3 MW of PV capacity was allocated, across four projects. The lowest price, of €56/MWh, was offered for a solar project. In the first procurement round, only one, 5 MW solar plant was awarded, along with 495 MW of wind capacity. The single PV project will sell electricity for €0.060/kWh.
Including the latest auction, the Italian authorities have allocated around 1.19 GW of PV through the tender scheme to date.
The GSE has recently launched the eight renewables auction, in which it expects to allocate another 3.3 GW of wind and solar capacity.
*The article was updated on January 31 to reflect that the auction's ceiling price was €0.065/kWh and not €0.070/kWh, as we previously reported.
