German PV product distributor Greenakku has begun selling two new hybrid inverters that German manufacturer Bosswerk has specifically designed for rooftop PV systems.
The BW-HY3600 and BW-HY4600 inverters can be integrated with existing on-grid or off-grid PV systems and a battery storage system of 48V. Both devices, according to Bosswerk, have AC and DC coupling and are particularly suitable for residential and commercial solar arrays.
The two products are claimed to increase the self-consumption rate of a project while offering additional benefits as an emergency power supply. If the power grid fails, the inverters are able to switch from grid operation to battery power within ten milliseconds, the company claims. For example, sensitive medical devices or technical systems could continue to be operated without interruption.
According to Bosswerk, the devices have integrated WLAN modules for easy monitoring. The manufacturer cites other advantages are state-of-the-art electronics to support the latest generation of solar modules, an integrated end point security (ENS) protection device in accordance with the VDE 4105 standard, six time ranges for charging or discharging the battery, frequency drop control for up to 16 batteries in parallel, and a grid peak shaving function.
The devices feature IP65 protection and are claimed to have an efficiency of 98.9%. They come with a 12-year product warranty.
According to Bosswerk, the BW-HY3600 is sold in Germany for €2,380 and the price for the other inverter will soon be announced.

Saudi energy company ACWA Power, part of a development consortium behind the $417 million, 1.5 million-panel plant today announced completion of the site, despite “disruptions to the supply chain as a result of the [Covid-19] pandemic.”
ACWA said the solar plant in Oman's Ad-Dhahirah governorate, which will generate enough electricity to power 50,000 homes, will sell electricity to state-owned utility the Oman Power and Water Procurement Company under a 15-year contract. ACWA did not specify how much the power company would pay for electricity generated at Ibri 2.
Lauding the start of operations at the 13 million square kilometer solar field, Yaqoob Saif al Kiyumi, CEO of the Omani utility, said the power company is also working on two solar projects with a combined generation capacity of 1GW in the Ad-Dakhiliyah governorate, without disclosing further details. That is likely to refer to the 1-1.2GW Manah I and II sites, for which a tender was opened in July 2019 with the aim of awarding contracts within a year.
Ibri 2 was developed by a consortium comprised of 50% Saudi state-owned ACWA Power; the Gulf Investment Corporation funded by the governments of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE; and Kuwaiti renewables developer Alternative Energy Projects Co. The latter business is 44.7% owned by the Al Futtooh holding company which is controlled by members of the Kuwaiti royal family.
Ibri 2, which consists of bifacial solar panels, is set to help Oman towards its goal of having renewables generate 20% of its electricity this decade and “up to 39%” by 2040.
ACWA Power said the supply chain for the project included the establishment of Omani start-ups Taj Middle East and Diaa Energy, to build mechanical installations and said the operations and maintenance team for the site was completely Omani.

A group of scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) claims to have made a leap forward to improve the scalability of perovskite solar cells, by replacing their electron-transport layers with a thin layer of quantum dots.
So far, perovskite solar cells have proven to be extremely unstable when scaled up to mass production and the high efficiencies achieved in laboratories cannot be easily reproduced when transferred to production lines, the researchers said. This is partly due to the cell's electron transport layer, which ensures that the electrons generated when the cell absorbs light are efficiently transferred to the device's electrode.
In conventional perovskite solar cells, the electron transport layer (ETL) consists of mesoporous titanium dioxide, which has low electron mobility and is also susceptible to negative photocatalytic events under ultraviolet light.
The EPFL replaced the ETL with a thin layer of tin(IV) oxide quantum dots stabilized with polyacrylic acid. This improved the light-trapping capacity of the cells while suppressing non-radiative recombination.
With the thin layer of quantum dots, higher efficiencies can also be transferred to larger cell formats. According to the researchers, they achieved a record efficiency of 25.7% on a perovskite solar cell with an area of 0.08cm2. At the same time, high operational stability was demonstrated, which resulted in efficiencies of 23.3%, 21.7% and 20.6% when the surface of the solar cells was increased to 1cm2, 20cm2, and 64cm2.
Quantum dots are nanometer-sized particles that act as semiconductors and emit light of specific wavelengths when illuminated. Because of their unique optical properties, quantum dots are ideal for use in a variety of optical applications, including photovoltaics.
Colloidal quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs) have caught the eye of PV researchers of late thanks to their potential for high conversion efficiency and low-cost processing. However, the technology is still a long way from leaving the lab. Beyond efficiency there are a host of other conditions that need to be met before commercial production can be considered.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/24/indias-solar-module-manufacturing-capacity-on-track-to-soar-400-in-four-years/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 24, 2022",India’s solar module manufacturing capacity on track to soar 400% in four years,"From pv magazine India.
India’s solar module manufacturing capacity is set to grow almost 400%, from the 8GW per year that was in place at the end of March to 38-43GW four years later.
U.S.-owned Indian ratings agency Crisil has predicted 30-35GW of newly-commissioned module production capacity will be in place by the end of fiscal year 2024-25, helped by strong demand, favorable policy, solar panel conversion efficiency improvements, and cost-competitiveness.
The analysts’ estimate is based on capital expenditure (capex) plans announced by the top 11 Indian module manufacturers – which account for around 80% of India's current panel production capacity – plus some new entrants to the market.
pv magazine’s UP Initiative recently turned its attention to PV module recycling. Our coverage included: An overview of current recycling processes in operation; the economics of recycling from the perspective of analyst BloombergNEF; future recycling scenarios; and an update of the EU and U.S. policy landscapes. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
Crisil director Ankit Hakhu said: “With the government supporting domestic manufacturers, through policy measures, their competitiveness relative to the Chinese is expected to improve. The imposition of 40% customs duty on imported modules and the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme benefits will not only eliminate the existing price gap but may even make domestic modules competitive by [$] 2-3 cents per watt, at current prices.” 
Those supply-side interventions will be complemented by growing solar demand, due to a continuing government focus on renewables as well as the private sector’s focus on environmental, social and governance standards, added the ratings agency. 
Crisil expects India to add 14GW of solar generation capacity per year in the current fiscal years, and for the next two, driving demand for cells and modules.
The analyst said Indian-made products could prove more attractive than imports due to having more predictable supply chains and being unfettered by surging shipping costs, as well as being, potentially, more competitively priced.
Aditya Jhaver, also a Crisil director, said: “We estimate INR50,000 crore ($6.71 billion) of investments across the value chain for capacity building in India through fiscal [2024-]2025. Module and cell manufacturing capacity is estimated to increase by 30-35GW each while, under the government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, we may also see backward integration into polysilicon and wafer capacities.
“A portion of the capex is also moving towards newer technologies such as mono PERC [and] bifacial modules, where [conversion] efficiencies are higher, and comparable with imports. That, along with healthy demand – which is supporting order books – and favorable government policies, is expected to drive operating margins for integrated solar module manufacturers (manufacturing both cells and modules) to 12-13%. It will also result in a payback period of 4.5-5 years, assuming 50% utilization levels.”
The solar module manufacturing value chain starts with polysilicon and/or silicon ingots, which are converted into wafers. The wafers are used to produce solar cells which are then assembled into solar modules.
As of March 31, India had 3GW of solar cell capacity, mostly used for the in-house production of modules, and 8GW of effective solar panel production capacity. The nation has no polysilicon or wafer manufacturing capacity yet, according to Crisil, and the absence of the “backward integration” of those steps of the solar value chain renders Indian-made modules uncompetitive with cheaper imports.
According to Crisil, India’s 8GW of module capacity remains under-utilized, with just 20% in operation as panel imports from China retail 15-25% cheaper – or $0.04-0.06/watt – because of state subsidies and economies of scale. As a result, nearly 80% of India’s solar module demand is met by Chinese products. 
That low level of demand for Indian modules has disincentivized major investment in more advanced products and into the backward integration of polysilicon and wafer manufacturing.

They described the cell in “Monolithic perovskite/organic tandem solar cells with 23.6% efficiency enabled by reduced voltage losses and optimized interconnecting layer,” which was recently published in Nature Energy. It has lower voltage, optical and electrical losses compared to other tandem cells of the same kind, which are usually limited by open-circuit voltage losses in the wide-bandgap perovskite subcells.
The research team said that ICLs are crucial for the performance and reproducibility of a tandem cell. An effective ICL should be chemically inert, electrically conductive and optically transparent, they explained.
The perovskite subcell's nickel oxide hole-transporting layers were passivated with benzylphosphonic acid leads. The scientists did this to suppress interfacial recombination, which in perovskite cells has a deep influence on electrical performance, including open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, fill factor, and ultimately, power conversion efficiency.
As a result, the subcell achieved a voltage up to 1.26V in a 1.79-eV-bandgap and the overall tandem cell efficiency reached 23.6%, a value that compares to around 20% in solar cells with the same tandem architecture.
“In addition, the tandem device retained 90% initial efficiency after 500 h maximum power point tracking under continuous one sun illumination,” the scientists said. “This technological breakthrough paves the way for flexible, lightweight, low cost and ultra-thin photovoltaic cells which are ideal for powering vehicles, boats, blinds and other applications.”

The project is developed in partnership with Digital Energy Corp, a New York-based private sector developer of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants, solar systems and microgrids.
The 100kW/1.5MWh zinc-air energy storage system (ZESS) will be installed at Fresh Meadows Community Apartments in Queens, New York, to support and enhance the economics of a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system currently under construction, along with an existing photovoltaic system.
Zinc8 Energy Solutions has developed a proprietary flow battery technology that it claims is able to deliver power in the range from 20kW to 50MW with a minimum storage of eight hours of capacity.
The modular battery can be configured to support a wide array of long-duration applications for microgrids and utilities, as well as for commercial and industrial projects. Unlike lithium-ion technology, which requires new stacks to scale, Zinc8 says it has completely decoupled the linkage between energy and power. This means that scaling Zinc8’s technology can be accomplished by simply increasing the size of the fuel tank and quantity of recharged zinc fuel.
The technology promises zero capacity fade over an extensive lifetime. According to the manufacturer, tt is non-flammable, non-toxic and sustainable with stable supply chains for mass production. It is also touted as a potentially hugely cost-effective solution, aiming for an installation cost of $45/kWh.
Zinc8’s system uses power from the grid or renewable energy sources to generate zinc particles in a zinc regenerator, thereby releasing oxygen as a by-product. The zinc particles flow then to the storage tank and are maintained there in a potassium hydroxide electrolyte. When power is needed, the zinc particles are delivered to the power stack and recombined with oxygen to generate electricity. The zinc oxide by-product is returned to the storage tank for later regeneration.
Zinc8 claims to have solved the dendrite issue, which leads to the clogging of the membranes used in flow batteries. The battery has a roundtrip efficiency ranging from 65% to 70%.
For its latest project at Fresh Meadows Apartments, Zinc8 tech has won financing from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). In this project, Zinc8 will be focused on advancing, developing and field testing its storage technology as it seeks to address cost, performance, and integration challenges in New York State. “This is an opportunity for Zinc8 to further develop a pipeline of projects and establish a foothold in the New York City market.” said Ron MacDonald, president and CEO of Zinc8 Energy Solutions.
Previously, Zinc8 signed an agreement with the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to deploy a 100 kW/1 MWh demonstration ZESS behind-the-meter at the University at Buffalo campus. The project was designed to provide peak shaving capability and improve campus resiliency, as well as explore alternative uses such as emergency backup for campus building. In addition, the Buffalo project aims to validate the system’s performance reliability and help to determine O&M and life-cycle costs.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/24/european-commission-advisory-body-slams-plan-to-label-gas-and-nuclear-sustainable/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE",MAX HALL,"JANUARY 24, 2022",European Commission advisory body slams plan to label gas and nuclear ‘sustainable’,"A panel of sustainable finance experts consulted by the European Commission has thrown a spanner in the works over the proposal by the EU executive to define natural gas and nuclear power as “sustainable.”
The suggestion, made by the commission over the Christmas and new year break, that fossil fuel gas and low-carbon energy source nuclear be included in the EU taxonomy of sustainable energy sources has proved hugely controversial.
Late on Friday night, the Platform on Sustainable Finance body of experts consulted by the commission on the topic roundly criticized the idea gas and nuclear be considered sustainable.
Panel member Sandrine Dixson-Declève said gas and nuclear projects contravene the central requirement that EU energy projects “do no significant harm,” to the bloc's environmental and climate change ambitions.
Dixson-Declève, co-president of the Swiss-based Club of Rome thinktank which includes current and former heads of state and other high-ranking politicians alongside scientists, diplomats, economists and business leaders, said the commission's draft Complementary Delegated Act, issued on Dec. 31 and passed to the panel for feedback, should be paused. The energy transition advocate said this morning: “The commission should not rush forward with the Complementary Delegated Act, additional time is needed to address and act on the platform feedback to ensure consistency with the intention of the taxonomy regulation.”
She pointed out natural-gas-fired generation could breach the emissions limits agreed for the sector by the EU, stating: “The emission intensity threshold of 100g of CO2 equivalent [emitted] per kilowatt-hour [of electricity generated] was agreed to by all three European Union institutions and the science-based goalposts should not be shifted in retrospect, to pander to national interests. The use of the green taxonomy to try and address all dimensions of the energy system transition is completely inappropriate and will completely undermine the impact of the taxonomy framework.”
Maia Godemer, research associate at analyst BloombergNEF will look back on the 2021 sustainable debt market in the February edition of pv magazine. Concerning the EU sustainability taxonomy, she writes: “In its current state, the proposed greenhouse gas thresholds for natural gas could derail EU climate targets and weaken the bloc’s green investment offering, according to BloombergNEF. The inclusion of nuclear raises eyebrows due to safety and waste management issues, which could prevent the technology [satisfying] the “do no significant harm” criteria outlined in the taxonomy.”
The draft Complementary Delegated Act was not made open to public feedback but the commission has committed to considering the responses made by the panel and by fellow consultation body the Member States Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, with both bodies required to submit their thoughts earlier this month.

The pilot facility is located at different heights during the charge and recharge cycles of the pumped-hydro plant and the difference in height may reach up to nine meters.
The east-west oriented photovoltaic system was built with air-filled floats with a carrying capacity of over six tons. The floats, and several rails attached to the walls of the pumped-hydro facility, are intended to maintain the system stably against adverse weather conditions and the water's vertical movement, CEZ Group said in a statement.
“There are great expectations for the deployment of photovoltaics on suitable water areas but only reality will show what we can achieve in Czechia,” it further explained. “If the pilot installation in Štěchovice will convince us, we would like to increase its output five times in the summer,” said Jan Kalina, member of the board of directors and director of CEZ's renewable and classic energy division.
The Štěchovice pumped-hydro storage facility is able supply a total of 200MWh of electricity in four hours and thus help stabilize the Czech energy system. Built in 1947 and then modernized in 1996, the plant can run at 100% capacity in just three minutes.
The CEZ Group currently owns and operates 126MW of PV capacity in Czechia. In November, it acquired German solar developer Belectric from RWE for an undisclosed sum. In September 2019, it invested €10 million in Zolar, a German start-up offering digital solutions for rooftop PV. All CEZ Group's Czech plants were deployed in 2009 and 2010, when a FIT scheme for large scale solar was in place.
The group also operates in Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Turkey.

Swirl defects are point defect agglomerates that can form in dislocation-free silicon crystals, which may have an influence on the uniformity of the electrical properties of Cz-Si cells. “The swirl-shaped region occurs most obviously in the solar cells fabricated by the wafers near the
shoulder of Cz-Si, whose influence still exists in the nearby wafers for a certain distance,” the scientists explained, noting that this phenomenon is often associated with hotspots and thermal breakdown.
The researchers used deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), which is a high‐frequency capacitance transient thermal scanning method useful for observing a wide variety of electrically active defects in semiconductors, to analyze the electrical parameters and properties of the Swirl defects in p-type Cz-silicon ingots embedded in defective solar cells. They compared, in particular, the properties of the defective cells with a swirl-shaped region with that of a reference cell with the same cell fabrication process but without a swirl-shaped region.
The performance of the cells was measured under standard radiation conditions through electroluminescence (EL), photo-induced current (LBIC), and quantum efficiency (QE) measurements. “The EL mapping of the defective cell shows a central dark circle and fading concentric
rings, indicating that the swirl-shaped region exhibits intensive recombination activity, which may be the major negative factor for solar cell performance”, they stated, noting that the defective devices exhibited lower open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and fill factor compared to the reference cells.

The defective cells were found to be 4.7% less efficient than the reference cells, which indicates, according to the research group, that Swirl defects are highly detrimental to their performance.
The Internal Quantum Efficiency (IEQ) of the defective cells was also significantly lower than the reference device. “For the referential cell,
the normal IQE kept above 95% in the range of 500–900 nm, and then dropped due to the low absorptivity in the near-infrared wavelength,” the academics explained. “However, the IQE of the defective cell started rapid decrease at about 500 nm, and dropped by 55.4% in the range of 500–900 nm.” The IEQ defines the ratio between the number of charge carriers collected at either terminal of the cell and the number of photons reaching the device's photoreactive surface.
The defective cells were then further analyzed by annealing them at 1050 degrees Celsius for 16 hours. This analysis showed that Swirl defects occurring close to the ingot shoulder are related to oxygen precipitates formed during the crystal growth process. “The influence of
Swirl defects generally exists in the nearby wafers within a large distance of ingots,” the scientists emphasized. “Wafers featuring these defects can be sorted out from production based on carrier lifetime measurement and can be potentially remelted, the key is to lower oxygen concentration in the system, and avoid oxygen precipitate nucleation during the pulling process.”
These improvements, they went on to say, may further reduce cell manufacturing costs. “The presence of Swirl defects could be mitigated by applying a heat treatment at a temperature above 1,050 degrees Celsius in a clean environment before the manufacturing of the solar cells,” they concluded.
Their findings were presented in the paper Comprehensive characterization of efficiency limiting defects in the swirl-shaped region of Czochralski silicon, published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.

The Shanghai Electric company owned by the city authorities sank RMB250 million (US$39.4 million) into the establishment of Chongqing Shenhua Thin Film Solar Technology Co Ltd in January 2017 in a bid to commercialize the technology.
Work was started on a 306MW CIGS cell production line in the intervening period, Shanghai Electric told the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Friday, but the project never entered commercial operation and has now been abandoned, leaving the utility on the hook for up to RMB300 million, depending on how much Chongqing Shenhua can repay its five backers.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
German PV production equipment company Manz was heavily involved in the planned project and, as reported by pv magazine at the time, offered up its R&D subsidiary Manz CIGS Technology GmbH to a joint venture with Shanghai Electric and Shenhua Group in return for €25 million (US$28.4 million) and a 15% stake in that CIGS-focused entity.
As news broke today of the abandonment of Shanghai Electric's plans for CIGS manufacturing, Manz told pv magazine: “As already communicated last year, Manz AG is in ongoing discussions with its customer regarding the termination of the CIGS projects. This has not changed as a result of the information from the Shanghai Electric Group about the implementation of an impairment.”
Explaining why the project had been abandoned, Shanghai Electric said crystalline silicon had come to dominate solar manufacturing in the past five years and had secured rapid cost reductions “while, for the CIGS thin film photovoltaic products, the R&D strength is weak, the product conversion efficiency is slow to improve, and the industrial chain is not yet mature.” The company continued: “If the [CIGS manufacturing] project is put into production, the revenue and cost of Chongqing Shenhua will be inverted, resulting in [a] huge amount of loss.”
The advantages of “CIGS batteries” in building-integrated PV were outweighed by the complexities of the construction industry, the utility added, referring to a sector of the Chinese economy which is suffering high-profile turmoil at the moment due to high levels of indebtedness.
Shanghai Electric invested its initial RMB250 million for a 20% stake in the ill-fated venture, which is now preparing for impairment losses of an estimated RMB1.42 billion (US$224 million) on equipment including that 306MW cell line.
China Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Co Ltd was the majority investor in a thin-film venture backed by public bodies, with its RMB675 million (US$106 million) securing a 54% stake. Shenzhen Laibao High-tech Co Ltd and the National Institute of Clean and Low Carbon Energy each contributed RMB125 million for 10% holdings and the Chongqing Liangjiang New Area Strategic Emerging Industry Equity Investment Fund Partnership held 6% of the stock after a RMB75 million (US$11.8 million) investment.

Selected bidders will be granted a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA). Interested developers will have until February 2 to submit their expressions of interest.
The government of the Philippines is also planning to introduce a Green Energy Tariff Program auction regime, under which it aims to allocate 2GW of renewable energy capacity. The country plans to install 15GW of clean energy by 2030.
Recent statistics released by the International Renewable Energy Agency show that the Philippines had an installed PV capacity of 1.04GW – driven by the country's renewable energy law – at the end of 2020. Most of the nation’s solar facilities were secured under the old feed-in tariff regime, auctions, and net metering programs.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has released its sixth paper – “Grid Operational Impacts of Widespread Storage Deployment”  – in its Storage Future Series. The purpose of the document is to analyze some of the effects of energy storage on the power grid as it evolves toward five unique scenarios in 2050.
The scenarios include the Reference Scenario, which follows all default pricing and technology assumptions by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). These assumptions can be found in the document, and other papers referenced, in full. NREL also examined the four following scenarios:
Even the Reference Scenario includes a lot of wind and solar – 20.4% and 28.8% of all US electricity, respectively. Solar PV generation projections among the five scenarios range from a low of 28.8% to a high of 46% in the High Natural Gas/Low Battery Cost scenario.
Interestingly, the Zero Carbon pathway predicts the third-highest total of solar power out of the five scenarios, at 33.4%. The solar is complemented by the highest wind volume in this scenario at 37.3%.
Energy storage power capacities range from 213GW to 932GW, with the average duration ranging from 4.7 to 6.5 hours. The chart below shows this volume being deployed in power, with its hourly rating specified by color. As time goes on, we see the longest duration batteries – and by far the highest total volume of product – installed in the 2040s as we approach the 2050 end year of the analysis.
The total volume of storage in the batteries ranges from 1.3 TWh to just over 6.0 TWh in the 94% renewable electricity, Zero Carbon scenario. Several years ago, a different group of researchers suggested that the United States could get to 80% wind and solar with approximately 5.4 TWh of energy storage.
The researchers revealed some nuances between the various scenarios. For instance the Zero Carbon scenario results in large amounts of curtailment of wind and solar nearly 24 hours a day, all year round. This leads to the batteries actually being used less than in other scenarios because the wind and solar is always running, and in its over producing nature, meets the grid demands often.
Furthermore, as the volumes of renewables grow, it becomes clear that storage’s charging needs most aligns with solar power’s generation curves, due to solar’s daily predictability. The report notes that oftentimes wind power will over-generate for days on end, far longer than the energy storage hourly durations considered for this document.
An expected outcome was that even though energy storage’s capacity factor is relatively low across all scenarios – the actual time spent outputting electricity is only 10% to 20% – its capacity factor exceeded 75% during the top 10 net load hours across all scenarios and years.
The authors compare these capacity factors and the utilization technique of batteries to a recent analysis of combustion turbine generators in the United States – often referred to as peaking plants – which had an average capacity factor of 11% in 2019. They pointed out several key benefits that energy storage delivered beyond simply offering electricity on demand.
On average, energy storage increased powerline utilization rates. However, these utilization rates varied widely depending on location. Some regions saw greater powerline usage as these locations exported more energy than they were using. Areas with strong local balance between generation, storage, and demand saw lower powerline utilization as little was imported or exported.
Of course, the fact that storage was able to charge up with the overgeneration of wind and solar in the Zero Carbon scenarios was its greatest benefit. Also seen was that diurnal storage – 12 hours of output and longer – does have an increasing opportunity as 2050 is reached, and 100% clean electricity is approached. Longer- term storage wasn’t analyzed in this report, but it might be in future documents from NREL.
As an aside, one can currently purchase 3.08 GWh worth of Tesla Megapacks for just over $1 billion. At these prices, 6 TWh would cost about $2 trillion. The gross domestic product of the United States in 2021 was about $23 trillion.

Sydney-based developer Genex has confirmed that work has commenced at its AUD 777 million ($556.3 million) Kidston Pumped Hydro Storage Project under development at two abandoned gold mine pits near Kidston, about 270 kilometers northwest of Townsville, in northern Queensland, Australia.
The pumped hydro facility is the centerpiece of what will become the Kidston Clean Energy Hub, which includes the existing 50MW Kidston Solar Farm, which Genex has been operating since 2017. Up to 270MW of additional solar and up to 150MW of wind generation have also been proposed.
The pumped hydro energy storage plant, planned for commissioning in 2024, involves the transfer of water between the two disused gold mine pits, which are located at different elevations. Water stored in the upper reservoir will drop about 220 meters down two vertical inlet shafts through reversible turbine-generators – to be located approximately 250 meters below ground level – into the lower reservoir to generate electricity.
Genex said last week that it has already undertaken extensive works in the past two months to establish the 1.5-kilometer-long underground main access tunnel. It will lead to the “powerhouse cavern” which will house the two 125 MW Andritz hydro reversible pump turbines. The company said preparation works for the main access tunnel had been completed and the underground excavation works formally commenced with the first major blast.
Genex CEO James Harding said the start of major engineering works at the site was a significant milestone for the project.
“This represents a significant milestone in the project construction timeline, which was achieved ahead of schedule,” he said. “We look forward to working alongside the EPC JV and keeping the market updated as the program continues to push ahead over the course of this year.”
Genex is almost finished building a 22kV distribution line that will connect the site to Ergon Energy’s Kidston substation, as the transformer is already installed. Work is also progressing on prototype tests of electrical towers for a new 275kV transmission line being constructed by Powerlink Queensland between Kidston and a new switchyard at Mount Fox. This will connect with the existing Ross to Chalumbin 275kV transmission line, allowing the facility to connect with the National Electricity Market (NEM).
The Kidston Pumped Hydro Storage Project will have 250MW generating capacity and energy storage capacity of 2GWh. The company said the storage equates to eight hours of generation at full load, or enough to power 143,000 homes. It will have a start-up time of less than 30 seconds, allowing it to respond quickly to any shortages of electricity supply.
Electricity supplier EnergyAustralia will operate the pumped hydro storage asset for up to 30 years after signing a binding energy storage services agreement (ESSA). EnergyAustralia, which is owned by Hong Kong-based China Light and Power Group (CLP), will have full operational dispatch rights for the hydro plant under the ESSA, in exchange for a fixed annual rental payment that will increase over the term of the agreement.
The 30-year agreement for operation of the asset is divided into 10-year terms, with two options to extend after the first 10-year period. If EnergyAustralia takes the agreement to its full extension, it will have the right to acquire Genex’s holding in the project which has an expected life of at least 80 years. Genex said the construction program remains on schedule for first generation in the fourth quarter of 2024.
The Kidston Pumped Storage Hydro Project is the first pumped hydro power station to be built in Australia since the Wivenhoe Power Station was constructed in Queensland in 1984. Upon completion, it will be one of four operating pumped hydro energy storage projects in Australia, including the Wivenhoe Power Station and the Tumut 3 power station that forms part of the Snowy Hydro scheme and the Shoalhaven Scheme in New South Wales.
However, there are several pumped hydro projects in the pipeline in Australia, including the 400 MW Big T project being developed by Melbourne-based BE Power in southeastern Queensland. EnergyAustralia is also investigating the feasibility of developing a 350 MW pumped hydro energy storage facility near its Mt Piper coal-fired power station at Lithgow while fellow gen-tailer AGL has revealed plans to explore the engineering feasibility of establishing a 250 MW, eight-hour duration pumped-hydro energy storage project at its Bells Mountain coal mine site in the Hunter Valley.
