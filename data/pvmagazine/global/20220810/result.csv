The projects are located in North Wales, Chester, South Northamptonshire, and North Lincolnshire.
The agreement is still subject to approvals and customary steps before completion. The four sites have been developed by Anesco over the past 18 months, and Shell reports they are now in the “final stages of planning.” As the controlling party, Shell will manage the engineering, procurement and production stage as well as taking responsibility for asset management, operations and maintenance.
The group says that it plans to seek offtakers for the projects through its Shell Energy Europe power trading team. It sees significant demand from corporates seeking to decarbonize with renewable electricity.
“Shell is building a business that spans the generation, trading and supply of clean energy to homes and businesses here in the UK,” said Lukas Fleming, head of onshore power at Shell UK. “Acquisition of these four solar energy projects from Anesco will mean we can help meet more of the growing demand for renewable power from our UK customers.”
Shell says that it plans to invest up to GBP 25 billion (€29.6 billion) in the UK energy sector over the next decade, with more than 75% of this intended for low- and zero-carbon products and services, including offshore wind, hydrogen and EV charging, alongside solar.
The company has worked with Anesco on several previous projects, including a battery storage plant at a Shell gas terminal in Norfolk. They also collaborated on three PV projects in the Netherlands, completed by Anesco earlier this year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/10/ampt-lawsuit-asks-that-solaredge-remove-inverters-and-controllers-from-market/,"LEGAL,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 10, 2022",Ampt lawsuit asks that SolarEdge remove inverters and controllers from market,"From pv magazine USA
Ampt, a power electronic specialist based in Fort Collins, Colorado, has filed a lawsuit against SolarEdge for allegedly violating a series of their patents.  According to Ampt, the violations at the heart of the issue are “power optimizers that contain high-efficiency power converters that both allow maximum power-point output, and use operational boundary conditions that continue producing power during conditions that might otherwise require the optimizer to be bypassed.”
The filing asks that the whole of SolarEdge’s inverter and optimizer lineup be removed from the marketplace for violation of these patents. Ampt contends that they, and other manufacturers, could replace SolarEdge’s hardware if needed.

Ampt filed with two separate courts – the Count of International Trade (ITC), whose online filing can be found here, and the US District Court of Delaware whole filing can be found here.
In the ITC Complaint filing, two patents were specifically highlighted – U.S. Patents Nos. 9,673,630 (‘630) and 11,289,917 (‘917).
The ’630 patent was issued in 2017, while the ’917 patent was recently awarded on March 29, 2022. Both patents claim priority to a provisional patent application filed in 2007. Ampt notes they were founded in Colorado in 2007.
The filing includes a circuit (below) that contains both a buck and boost converter. Ampt states that this “power optimizer circuit of (their) invention…describes a dual-mode configuration that provides high efficiency for their specific use-case.”

Buck converters step voltages down, while boost converters step voltages up. Solar optimizers regulate the voltages and amperages of individual solar panels in combination with their inverter, among a string of solar panels arranged in a series circuit.
The longer form filing with the ITC court includes an image of the circuitry inside of a SolarEdge optimizer, pointing out the location of the buck-boost converter.

The filing also highlighted operational boundaries and how they interact with over current and voltage, while attempting to optimize for the maximum power point (MPPT).
To this author’s very limited electrical knowledge, all inverter manufacturers use these two techniques to manage solar power. Solar charge controllers in off-grid systems specifically focus on these designs in order to keep voltages consistent when charging batteries from variable output solar panels.

It is not possible for pv magazine to check the correctness of patent claims and the arguments of the companies. For fairness, we gave SolarEdge the opportunity to respond, and they provided the following:
“SolarEdge and AMPT have been litigating a dispute involving a patent family filed by SolarEdge and a patent family filed by AMPT before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for many years. Recently, the USPTO awarded priority of invention to SolarEdge, cancelled the claims of AMPT’s patents, and awarded the patent claims in these AMPT patents to SolarEdge. It appears that having lost before the USPTO, AMPT is now shopping around its claims to other courts. SolarEdge anticipates a vigorous defense of these new cases.”

The rooftop PV rollout program was proposed by the entity’s Ministry of Energy and Mining and will be implemented by state-owned power utility Elektroprivreda Republike Srpske (ERS). All interested households and businesses in the Serb Republic are invited to take part in a public call, the details of which are soon to be announced.
ERS will operate the PV plants and provide initial financial resources for the project. Earlier this year, the power utility voiced its expectation for around 50,000 prosumers to install PV systems under its new net metering program, and now new details have emerged.
According to ERS CEO Luka Petrovic, households and businesses selected for the program will pay off their PV systems over the next 10 years. They will also be safeguarded from potential electricity price hikes over the next 25 years.
“Our idea is to have businesses and homeowners pay for 50% to 60% of the PV system, with the rest of the cost covered by ERS and environmental protection and energy efficiency fund eFikasnost Srpske,” he said, adding that the first PV systems could be installed by the end of this year, with 50,000 systems scheduled for completion by mid-2024.
Earlier this year, Minister of Energy and Mining of Serb Republic Petar Djokic said that around 900 MW of renewables are expected to join the grid over the next five years. Echoing this announcement, solar development has picked up the pace.
In June, Serb Republic launched an international tender to build an 80 MW solar power plant in the municipality of Bileca, which will be collocated with a 39.6 MW wind farm. In July, ERS announced it had signed a 30-year concession contract with the Central Bosnia Canton for the construction and operation of two PV plants in the Bugojno municipality with a combined capacity of up to 50 MW.

The photo-rechargeable system merges stable and ultra-high-rate quasi-solid-state zinc-ion micro-batteries and flexible perovskite solar cells, enabling electronics to operate continuously without plug-in charging.
“Our prototype could represent a step forward to how we interact with wearables and other internet-of-things devices, such as remote real-time health monitors,” said Jinxin Bi, a PhD candidate at ATI and the first author of the paper.
Miniaturized flexible photo-rechargeable systems show bright prospects for wide applications in internet of things, self-powered health monitoring and emergency electronics. However, conventional systems still suffer from complex manufacturing processes, slow photo-charging and discharging rate, and mismatch between photovoltaic and energy storage components in size, mechanics, and voltage, and other aspects.
The ATI researchers described their study in Energy Storage Materials. They demonstrated a facile inkjet printing and electrodeposition approach to fabricate such highly integrated flexible photo-rechargeable system.
Specifically, they first introduced a Ni protective layer into ZMBs to stabilize the battery configuration and facilitate enhanced electrochemical performance. The optimized ZMB exhibits ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 148 mWh cm−3 (16.3 μWh cm−2) and power density of 55 W cm−3 (6.1 mW cm−2) at the current density of 400 C (5 mA cm−2).
As a result, the embedded perovskite solar cells showed excellent performance – enough to charge the battery and create a self-charging system capable of offering energy autonomy in miniaturized wearable electronics. The ATI researchers said the system has particularly high energy and volume density, comparable to state-of-the-art micro-batteries and supercapacitors.
“The unique features in our ultrafast photo-rechargeable system could promote wide applications in self-powered wearable internet-of-things, autonomous power systems and emergency electronics,” said Yunlong Zhao, project co-lead. “In addition, it will broaden the perception and insight of designing the next generation of miniaturised flexible photo-rechargeable systems.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/10/why-is-green-energy-infrastructure-booming-despite-global-economic-woes/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"AUGUST 10, 2022",Why is green energy infrastructure booming despite global economic woes?,"That is not to say the sector has been immune to the challenging environment of the last two and a half years. With global value chains severely disrupted by Covid-19 lockdowns and geopolitical frictions, many renewable energy projects have seen significant delays in installations.
Orders of new solar panels or battery systems for grid-scale applications can now take anywhere between a couple of months to a staggering two years. More than 315 projects in the US, for example, are being canceled or delayed in 2022 due to supply chain constraints, according to Washington D.C.-based trade group Solar Energy Industries Association.
NextEra, one of America’s largest green infrastructure developers and capital investors, recently announced that approximately 2.1 to 2.8 GW of its solar and storage projects will need to be shifted from 2022 to 2023.
At the same time, renewable energy developers are grappling with surging metal prices. The price of polysilicon, a key material in the solar photovoltaic value chain, has grown a record 300% since January 2020. Another key substance used in electric vehicles as well as grid-scale energy storage applications, lithium carbonate, was traded in the Asian-Pacific market at US$72.15/kg in June 2022, a rapid climb from $6.75/kg in December 2020.
In an industry heavily reliant on minerals and metals that are often sourced and shipped across continents, such cost hikes threaten to inflate the costs of transitioning from fossil-based to zero-carbon energy systems.
Delivery delays and price spikes have highlighted the need for more diversified supply chains but they have also failed to undermine the green infrastructure boom. On the contrary, renewable energy capacity additions reached a record high last year, with approximately 270 GW of renewables becoming operational globally in 2021.
The trend is expected to continue in 2022 with renewable energy capacity additions forecast to grow by another 8%, with solar to account for approximately 60% of new installations. Similar trends can be seen in the job market, with US renewable energy jobs growing in 2021 after a decline in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
This clean energy buildout comes on the back of increased M&A activity in the sector and significant private capital inflows. Global sustainable funds reached an all-time high of $3.9 trillion in Q3 2021, doubling in just 12 months.
In 2021, US battery storage, smart grid, and energy efficiency start-ups attracted a record $10.1 billion in venture funding, a stark increase from $2.6 billion in 2020. In Europe, unprecedented high deal-making activity in 2021 saw many renewable energy platforms trading at huge premiums.
In 2022, global clean energy investments are expected to top $2.4 trillion, well above pre-Covid levels. Investors’ appetite for renewable energy projects seems to show no signs of waning.
Several factors are responsible for this growth. First, simple economics are in favor of building more renewables. Falling costs of most clean technologies now make a strong business case for renewables, as many clean energy technologies undercut even the cheapest fossil fuels on costs. In the first half of 2022, levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) of Solar PV and onshore wind were at $45 MWh and $46/MWh respectively, while LCOE of new coal and gas amounted to $47/MWh and $81/MWh, according to BloombergNEF. Costs of lithium-ion battery storage, a technology essential in providing flexibility to the grid and enabling higher adoption of renewables, went down 97% over the last three decades since its first commercial application in 1991.
Secondly, governmental commitment and green recovery packages are paramount to making green infrastructure projects bankable from the private sector's perspective. Renewed focus on green and resilient post-pandemic growth, coupled with more ambitious net-zero targets announced by countries in recent years, have helped boost confidence in the sector and kept the renewable energy boom afloat despite the economic slowdown.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine further shed light on the need for more diversified energy supply chains. Cheap renewables can help lower the world’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels while creating clean and resilient electricity systems.
The jury is still out on just how deep and long the current recession will be and about its lasting implications for the green energy sector. In times of economic uncertainty, tailor-made government incentives and regulatory improvements become ever more important. The passing of the Inflation Reduction Act by the US Senate that allocates $369 billion to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done on the global level.
Encouraging the local production of supply chain components, availability of financing, or streamlining renewable energy permitting and grid interconnection processes are just some of the areas that can help mitigate the impact of the recession on the energy sector.

Growth in bifacial PV, along with solar making its way into urban environments and even vehicles, mean that more factors need to be considered in such models, and accurate calculation is highly complex.
Ray tracing models, that follow the path of individual ray of light from module to source or vice versa, offer the most accurate simulation of PV system operation, but also require a lot of time and processing power to complete. And accounting for changes both to the module surface and the sky throughout the day make these models even more complex to process.
Scientists led TU Delft in the Netherlands looked for a way to reduce the modelling complexity without sacrificing accuracy, and developed a backward ray tracing that uses separate calculations for the illumination conditions and module surface.
“The main advantage of the presented simulation approach is that it allows to fully decouple the solution of the ray tracing problem from both the optical properties (i.e., reflectivity) of the surfaces in the scene and the illumination conditions,” they explained. “The decoupling of the irradiance simulation problem into three parts allows to significantly reduce computation times in comparison to conventional ray tracing simulation approaches. The highly time consuming ray tracing simulations only need to be solved once and the results are stored in memory to quickly evaluate the irradiance profile on the module.”
The model is described in “Time-varying, ray tracing irradiance simulation approach for photovoltaic systems in complex scenarios with decoupled geometry, optical properties and illumination conditions,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
To validate its approach, the group simulated the conditions at its monitoring station in the Netherlands, and compared the results with data gathered from a pyranometer and a reference cell installed at the site, finding that the absolute error in its simulations measured less than 5%. Further comparisons with data from a spectroradiometer, however, found that the model lacks the sophistication to deal with the effect of clouds on the light spectrum.
A key advantage however, is the models ability to calculate with multiple albedo values, to distinguish between different surfaces and the amount of light they reflect.
“In comparison to traditional ray tracers, the presented approach offers a practical way to simulate surfaces with time varying optical properties and compute the spectral irradiance incident on a PV module,” the group concluded. “These features are particularly valuable for the simulation of bifacial and tandem PV systems.”

Spain’s Iberdrola group, through its ScottishPower subsidiary, plans to build a green hydrogen production plant at Felixstowe, England – the UK’s largest port. Iberdrola will invest GBP 150 million (€170 million) in the project, which is expected to be completed in 2026.
ScottishPower, which is the distribution network for parts of Scotland and northern England, has been a subsidiary of Iberdrola since 2007. It will develop the project in collaboration with Hutchison Ports. The facility will be developed on vacant land at Felixstowe, taking up roughly the size of a soccer field.
In its first phase – set to go online in 2026 – the project will have the capacity to produce 14,000 tons of hydrogen per year through electrolyzers, and this capacity may be doubled in the future. The plant will supply hydrogen to vehicles and machinery used at the port, as well as trains that transport goods to the port. Additionally, the facility also has the potential to be used for production of ammonia or ethanol, which could be used as clean fuels for maritime transport, or for export to international markets.
Felixstowe is located in southeast England, close to several of the wind farms that Iberdrola operates in the North Sea. The company has already commissioned the 714 MW East Anglia ONE project, and plans to build the East Anglia offshore wind complex, which will bring two additional projects to the area, for a total capacity of 2.9 GW.
Iberdrola has also announced further plans for hydrogen production in the UK. A project planned in collaboration with Storegga in Comarty, northern Scotland, will allow for the decarbonization of heating processes used in distilleries. This project will have an initial capacity of 4,000 tons per year, and could eventually be expanded to 20,000 tons.
The Spanish company also plans to install a green hydrogen plant at its Whitelee wind farm on the outskirts of Glasgow, which is expected to be in operation next year with a capacity of 3,000 tons per year. The project has also received government investment to the tune of GBP 9.4 million.
In total, the Iberdrola group is developing more than 60 green hydrogen projects across eight countries. It states that its green hydrogen portfolio will total production capacity of 400,000 tons per year by 2030, requiring total investment of €9 billion.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/10/secrets-of-sustainable-distributed-generation-strategies/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"AUGUST 10, 2022",Secrets of sustainable distributed-generation strategies,"From pv magazine USA
The way the United States manages electricity was transformed more than 40 years ago with legislation that established open access to the transmission level of the electricity grid. Known commonly as PURPA, it created independent system operators (ISOs) across the country to manage supply and demand in an unbiased manner. While the legislation had a tremendous impact, we now face a dire need to revisit how electricity markets are structured to accommodate the rapid influx of renewable energy systems that the Inflation Reduction Act will likely bring to the grid. It’s time to expand the PURPA approach to the distribution level of the electricity grid.
The sad truth is that our electricity markets currently lack the ability to accept the vast amounts of renewable energy capacity to meet state targets and corporate commitments to procure clean energy. A study by Princeton University found that high-voltage transmission capacity would need to expand by 60% to meet clean energy targets, representing billions of dollars in needed utility upgrades.
However, we can avoid much of this need by siting renewable resources closer to where they are needed – at the distribution level of the grid. In order to do so, we will need to take several key steps to solve major system barriers to expanding renewable energy on the grid. The good news is that with some policy improvements – some major and some minor – renewable energy capacity at the distribution level can meet needs without the long lead time required for larger, utility-scale resources.
Step 1: Unlock grid congestion data for more transparency
Across most of the United States, it’s relatively unknown to renewable energy developers how the grid will be able to handle the influx of new power generation at a particular location of the grid. This lack of transparency leads to cost uncertainty for developers and delays as projects get assessed for their grid impact and potential costs.
The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) found a solution to this issue by requiring the state’s largest utilities to show where new renewable energy and energy storage capacity can be added to the grid without costly upgrades. While not foolproof, these interactive maps are a welcome feature that should be adapted across the country as a first step towards transparency. All utilities should have this data at their fingertips, so this step should be fairly straightforward to achieve.
Step 2: Integrate distributed generation into grid planning
While conventional thinking would suggest that large, centralized power stations would provide economies of scale benefits, the traditional approach to utility grid planning only considers the transmission level of the grid. Moreover, it fails to consider the costs and benefits of energy resources  at the distribution level, such as community solar and energy storage.
Utilities should be encouraged and incentivized to participate in the growth of distributed energy resources. For example, community solar programs in Colorado have included the participation of both private developers as well as the state’s largest utility, Xcel Energy. This approach may reduce the opportunity available to non-utility investors, but it does provide a more sustainable approach that isn’t at odds with the future of the electric utility as we know it.
In addition, regulators should require utilities to plan for widespread deployment of local solar and storage when spending billions on hardening and upgrading the grid, as many utilities are currently requesting to do.  Regulators, utilities, and developers can and should work together to build these grid upgrades that allow for distributed energy. This would result in lowered costs and increased speed to deployment for new resources that bring significant societal benefits.
Step 3: Enact legislation and regulation that allows for long-term, proactive distributed generation growth
Through state legislation and regulation, some states are already fostering the growth of distributed generation. Located in close proximity to end users, distributed generation provides unique resiliency and reliability benefits. Projects have less environmental impact and reflect a lower interconnection burden on the grid.
Because the distribution level of the grid lacks open access, state legislation is required to create programs that allow renewable energy developers to build projects to serve local communities. Some states, like Illinois, have generous program incentives to encourage new capacity. While the incentives are welcome, the main benefit of these programs is that they create a process to add distribution level capacity to the grid. Developers flock to states with such programs  until they are exhausted, then move to the next state with open capacity. The business model is akin to playing a game of whack-a-mole across the United States to find the next renewable energy market.
Instead, states should work to proactively enable their grid to deploy more distributed energy through a more market-based approach with increased transparency.  The actions mentioned in Steps 1 and 2 are good starts toward this, but more can be done. An ideal system would provide a scaled approach to both grid access and applicable incentives that reflects the need for capacity and the potential benefits that a given project would provide. A 2020 study by the Local Solar for All Coalition shows that the public stands to reap over $400 billion in savings and two million jobs by 2050 from a more local and clean electricity grid, not to mention its importance to fighting climate change.
New York has taken such an approach to distributed generation policy through their relatively new “Solar Value Stack” model that appropriately incentivizes and directs deployment of renewable energy. Through this approach, each project is assigned a value to the grid by combining the local wholesale price with benefits like reduced carbon emissions and cost savings to customers. It’s the closest thing that we have today to proactive planning for projects that match grid needs.
The Coalition for Community Solar Access released a report earlier this year that outlines specific policies that states and utilities should follow to modernize the grid. It also encourages support for state regulators and policymakers so that they have the resources available to create effective policy.
Step 4: Create an independent body to manage the distribution level of the grid
Unlike the framework created by PURPA for the transmission level of the grid, the distribution level currently lacks an independent body to facilitate the buying and selling of electricity. Instead, electric utilities fully manage access with monopoly power of the local grid. Because state action is required to create special programs that set aside capacity for distributed generation projects, solar developers face unnecessary delays and market uncertainty, such as the 18-month waiting period in Massachusetts for new capacity. While the New York model is already an improvement, we can go a step further.
The solution is to create independent distribution-level entities that facilitate open access, just like ISOs are currently doing at the transmission level. Utility companies will likely object to such ideas, driven by concerns about an erosion of market share and loss of control of customer relationships. However, utilities have a key part to play in the grid of the future. They should be profitable, sustainable entities that are compensated appropriately for access to a grid that they manage.
This more granular take on an ISO means the creation of distribution system operators, or DSOs, to serve as referees to facilitate another part of the electricity supply chain. Under such a framework, utilities would still be paid for managing grid infrastructure and the power that they produce. In addition, distributed generation project owners would have open access (like at the transmission level) to sell electricity and much more transparent paths to interconnect projects.
The climate crisis has already brought significant changes to the electric grid. The cost of renewable energy has steadily decreased over the past decade. New technologies, like energy storage, are adding even more value to the grid by maximizing the impact of renewables. Community solar now represents a sweet spot through optimally sized projects that better serve the local environment and consumers alike. But we need to do more, and we need to do it faster.
The good news is that there is already a framework from the 1970s “energy crisis” that can be adapted to help solve our existing “climate crisis.” While the framework that PURPA created may not be perfect, it provides a good lens through which we can see the grid of the future. Our overarching goal should be a new system that works to solve the existing climate crisis by fostering more renewable energy on the electricity grid.
