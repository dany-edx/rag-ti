The figures available range from €69.5 billion for Spain and €68.9 billion for Italy down to €989 million for Ireland, €970 million for Estonia, €316 million for Malta, and €93 million for Luxembourg, to be disbursed in three stages up to the end of 2023.
The two EU bodies indicated those amounts will come out of the €312.5 billion to be made available in the form of grants as part of the bloc's €672.5 billion recovery and resilience fund (RRF)–although the sum of the grant ceilings published added up to €338 billion, presumably to take into account currency fluctuation to the end of 2023. The balance of the €672.5 billion will come in the form of EU loans to member states over the same period.
Renewable energy generation projects will qualify for RRF backing but, in every case, finance granted in response to national recovery plans submitted by member states by April must be accompanied by contributions out of national budgets.
The RRF rules document, published today on the EUR-Lex European law website, stated projects begun since the start of this month will be eligible for RRF backing, with a requirement at least 37% of spending be devoted to ‘climate objectives' and 20% to digital transformation. RRF-backed projects must also be proven to do no significant harm to the bloc's environmental objectives.
The three-year plan is set to come into force this month and member states will be able to secure 13% of the grant and loan support available to them, “to the extent possible,” by May, the document stated. Some 70% of the maximum funding on offer will be disbursed by the end of 2022, with the remaining 30% available in 2023.
The maximum, three-year grant funding available to the other EU member states (rounded) is as follows: France, €39.4 billion; Germany, €25.6 billion; Poland, €23.9 billion; Greece, €17.8 billion; Romania, €14.2 billion; Portugal, €13.9 billion; Hungary, €7.18 billion; Czechia, €7.07 billion; Slovakia, €6.33 billion; Croatia, €6.3 billion; Bulgaria, €6.27 billion; the Netherlands, €5.96 billion; Belgium, €5.93 billion; Austria, €3.46 billion; Sweden, €3.29 billion; Lithuania, €2.22 billion; Finland, €2.09 billion; Latvia, €1.96 billion; Slovenia, €1.78 billion; Denmark, €1.55 billion; and Cyprus, €1.01 billion.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/18/chinas-cheap-electricity-crowds-out-foreign-polysilicon/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,GERMANY,MALAYSIA,SOUTH KOREA,WASHINGTON",MAX HALL,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",China’s cheap electricity crowds out foreign polysilicon,"Polysilicon market analyst Johannes Bernreuter says China imported around 30% less polysilicon last year and cornered 80% of the global market for its domestic manufacturers, fueled by uber-low electricity prices.
“South Korea’s polysilicon industry was out-competed by Chinese producers who enjoy extremely low and subsidized electricity rates from coal-fired power plants in the western regions of Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia,” said Bernreuter, noting Korean players OCI and Hanwha exited the market a year ago, citing electricity prices.
That decision prompted the volume of South Korean polysilicon imported by China to fall from 48,881 metric tons (MT) in 2019 to just 15,331 MT last year, according to the analyst, who said Korean poly had made up more than 70,000 MT of imports by China in 2016 and 2017, before the nation's third largest manufacturer of the commodity–Hancook Silicon–became insolvent in 2018.
OCI is still supplying the product to China, however, via its Malaysian manufacturing operation, which supplied 23% of Chinese polysilicon imports last year, according to Bernreuter.
With German manufacturer Wacker supplying 50,061 MT of polysilicon to China in 2020–despite running production at 70% capacity from May to July–Bernreuter estimates German and Malaysian-made product will account for almost 90% of China's poly imports this year. The amount of polysilicon shipped by Wacker to China slipped last year, from 52,667 MT in 2019.
The other major change was observed in Chinese imports of U.S.-made polysilicon, which is now subject to heavy customs duties. The 9,227 MT of product moved across the Pacific in 2019 slumped to 2,659 MT last year, reflecting the shuttering of the Moses Lake facility in Washington state owned by Norwegian business REC Silicon, in July 2019.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/18/pv-can-cover-almost-half-of-typical-office-buildings-electricity-demand/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,GERMANY",RALPH DIERMANN,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",PV can cover almost half of typical office buildings’ electricity demand,"From pv magazine Germany
How much of the electricity needs of an office building can be met with a photovoltaic system installed on-site? A group of researchers at the Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-Württemberg (ZSW), in Germany, is now seeking to give an answer to this question by using its own data, coming from a PV facade and a rooftop array based on CIGS module that are installed on its building in Stuttgart.
The scientists transferred the yield data into a model and found that the electricity from the roof and facade modules can cover almost 40% of the total requirements of a standard office building, assuming that no battery storage is installed.
The researchers based their modeling on a typical five-floor administrative building. Assuming that a quarter of the entire facade and 30% of the roof area are covered with photovoltaics, the PV system should have an installed power of 131 kW and generate around 115,000 kWh of electricity per year.
“The facades alone provided 29% of the electricity consumed over a period of one year,” explained Dieter Geyer, project manager at ZSW. Around 80% of the generated solar power could be used for this purpose, the rest of the system can be fed into the power grid. “The combination of photovoltaics on the facade and on the roof even increased the self-sufficiency share to 39%,” says Geyer, adding that about 58% of the produced solar power can be used locally.
The high self-consumption rate is possible without battery storage. “This is due to the fact that office buildings mainly need electricity during the day, so a good part of the solar power generated can be used immediately throughout the day,” said Geyer. In addition, with a suitable orientation, solar facades generate electricity primarily in the morning and evening hours, whereas the roof systems primarily generate electricity at midday. There is a permanently high supply of solar power in the consumption-intensive period between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.
According to the ZSW, roof and facade systems also go well with each other across the seasons: while the highest performance values for the roof system occur, as expected, in the summer months, the photovoltaic facade ideally complements the annual generation profile, with its highest output during the winter months. Facade systems make better use of the low sun in winter than roof systems, due to their vertical alignment.
In addition to generating electricity, photovoltaic facades offer other advantages, according to the ZSW. They protect them from wind and weather, provide shade, reduce heat losses and replace conventional components. Last but not least, according to the German scientists, they have a sound-insulating effect.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/18/geo-referenced-approach-to-identify-communities-that-can-afford-pv-mini-grids/,"MICROGRID,MINIGRID,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",Geo-referenced approach to identify communities that can afford PV mini-grids,"A group of researchers from the European Union’s Joint Research Center (JRC); the German Development Institute; University College London, in the U.K.; Hungary's Corvinus University of Budapest; the Technical University of Denmark; and the University of California at Berkeley, in the U.S., has developed a new methodology to map unelectrified communities for which the deployment of off-grid PV would be an affordable solution even when competing with low-priced diesel.
The proposed approach can be applied to 71 countries in areas of the global ‘sun belt', in East Asia, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. ” “Technically, it could be applied anywhere,” research co-author, Daniel Puig, told pv magazine.
The global sun belt is the area around the world that has the highest level of solar radiation per day, month, and year, and includes countries located within 35 degrees latitude above or below the equator. These regions are the Mediterranean and Africa, China and India, Latin America, and Australia.
“This approach draws in pioneering sub-national estimates of affordability levels combined with population characteristics,” the academics specified, adding that it includes ability-to-pay and affordability considerations at a highly disaggregated resolution never provided before. The model relies on 2014 and 2015 geo-referenced datasets in various formats and spatial resolutions, as well as on a population dataset based on global human settlements (GHSL) and World Bank national-level estimates of electrification.
Through the new methodology, project developers should be able to calculate site-specific electricity generation costs at a resolution of 1 km2 and estimate annual investment costs under two different scenarios, which are characterized by high and low diesel prices.
The analysis tool is also able to distinguish between regulatory frameworks are either favorable or unfavorable to solar. “These scenarios provide narratives of plausible future changes in socioeconomic parameters,” the academics explained. “They are used to foster comparability among prospective studies on climate change management.”
In the scenario with favorable conditions for PV, diesel prices are given by the highest retail prices in the last decade in each country, including national taxes and subsidies. A solar minigrid's cost estimate reflects current PV component and storage prices and component replacements. It also considers operation and maintenance (O&M) costs over a 20-year period and a project's environmental impact.
“The two scenarios are consistent with the so-called representative concentration pathways (RCPs), which are used across most scenario development studies,” Puig further explained. “As such, our findings are comparable to the findings of all other studies that are consistent with the RCPs.”
The proposed approach, which also relies on sub-national data drawn from the so-called poverty gap index, is also recommended for electrification programs to be implemented in under-served or rural areas, with low purchasing power in particular. “At present, most national investment decisions on electrification are shortsighted,” the academics concluded. “They often put too much weight on up-front costs,” they added, noting that investments made by public entities or independent power producers will not deliver optimal results if they neglect O&M costs and health and environmental concerns.
The model is described in the paper Mapping of affordability levels for photovoltaic-based electricity generation in the solar belt of sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and South Asia, published in Scientific Reports.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/18/new-method-to-produce-silicon-anodes-for-lithium-ion-batteries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",New method to produce silicon anodes for lithium-ion batteries,"The use of graphite as an anode material is behind many of the limitations to today’s lithium-ion batteries. Though a reliable material, graphite’s comparatively low theoretical capacity, and tendency to lose this capacity at high current densities, are two factors preventing major improvements to the capacity and performance of commercial lithium-ion batteries.
Silicon is among a few materials vying for researchers' attention as a new anode material, and with around ten times the theoretical capacity of graphite, it certainly has plenty of potential. During battery cycling, however, the silicon tends to expand and subsequently fall apart, leading to rapid performance loss.
Researchers have discovered various solutions to this, including making the silicon porous to begin with, or working with a ‘scaffold’ structure of carbon nanotubes. At this early stage in the research, however, few have focused on the cost or potential scalability of the processes investigated.
Scientists at Mid Sweden University looked to address this, investigating a new process for silicon anode production where nanometer-sized particles of silicon are coated onto flakes of graphite using an ‘aerogel’ process. With this process, they produced an anode with 455 millamp-hours per gram (mAh/g-1) specific capacity and 97% coulombic efficiency at a current density of 100 milliamps per gram. Details of the process and characterization of this anode are published in Scientific Reports, in the paper Silicon-Nanographite Aerogel-Based Anodes for High Performance Lithium Ion Batteries.
The anode relies on graphite as an additive to boost the conductivity and connect the tiny silicon nanoparticles. At the first cycle, the anode reached a capacity of 1050 mAh/g-1, close to silicon’s theoretical limit. This quickly decreased to 57% of the initial value after 30 cycles, and 52% after 100 cycles. The researchers noted that this represents a major improvement in comparison with results from pristine, milled or heat-treated silicon. At the first cycle, the anodes' specific energy was measured at 787 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg), falling to 341.25 Wh/kG after 200 cycles.
While other approaches have shown stronger results in capacity retention, the researchers here note that these often rely on complex or expensive processes not well suited to large-scale production. “Si nanoparticles were grown on nanographite flakes by aerogel fabrication route from Si powder and nanographite using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) by a simple, cost-efficient, and scalable method, which does not require expensive equipments for the synthesis,” stated the researchers. “In this study, we show that electrodes prepared based on this structure show high specific capacity and cycling stability, thus being a potentially cost-effective method for Si-based anodes.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/18/european-commission-natural-gas-can-be-part-of-green-transition/,"FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE",MAX HALL,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",European Commission: Natural gas can be part of green transition,"A technical guidance document published by the European Commission today has confirmed natural gas can be deemed to ‘do no significant harm' to the EU's climate change mitigation strategy, albeit with caveats.
With the EU preparing to dole out the first payments from its €672.5 billion recovery and resilience fund (RRF) within a fortnight–in response to recovery and resilience plans drawn up by member states requesting cash for their Covid recovery programs–the commission has published guidance defining how to interpret the crucial requirement RRF funds not be spent in a way which does significant harm to the bloc's environmental objectives.

The six areas deemed EU environmental policies include climate change mitigation and the European renewables industry has insisted the burning of fossil fuel natural gas should not be financed by RRF money as it would harm that objective.
A technical guidance note published by the commission on the EUR Lex European law portal today, however, states money for natural gas projects for power and heating “can, exceptionally, be given on a case-by-case basis in member states that face significant challenges in the transition away from carbon-intensive energy sources.”
The document states eligibility can be secured if projects have greenhouse gas emissions lower than 250g of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour over their lifetime. Alternatively, projects can be RRF funded if part of national plans with credible commitments to raise the use of renewable, “low-carbon gases” and concrete reforms to raise the share of renewables and investment in clean power; they also coincide with the simultaneous closure of “significantly more carbon-intensive” facilities; and the member state can demonstrate a credible trajectory for nearing its 2030 renewables target.
New natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure can be supported by the RRF if it would also be able to accommodate renewable and low-carbon gases.
Natural gas boilers and residential heating systems can qualify for support if devices meet energy labeling requirements or are part of wider energy efficiency or building renovation programs which meet EU building energy performance requirements and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Such installation programs must also improve the quality of the environment, for example by reducing air pollution when replacing coal and oil-based systems.
The commission notes the fulfillment of the requirements mentioned does not alter the fact any natural gas projects must also not cause significant harm to the other five of the bloc's environmental objectives: climate change adaptation; the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.
Circular manufacturing was a recent focus of our UP initiative. We looked at whether adopting circular approaches could create a competitive edge and reap financial and reputational rewards, in addition to investigating what is already being done in the solar industry. Browse our coverage here.
Critics of natural gas may note, however, the exceptions afforded the fossil fuel appear to be at odds with a requirement that “for economic activities where there is a technologically and economically feasible alternative with low environmental impact,” the emissions of the new project be measured in absolute terms, rather than compared with previous technology. The commission gives the example of a proposed scrappage scheme to replace older, more polluting internal combustion engine (ICE) cars with newer, cleaner non-electric models. In such a case, states the document, the environmental impact of the new ICE cars should be measured against the impact of electric vehicles, which are a technologically and economically feasible alternative.
That example could equally apply to new gas-fired generation facilities, environmentalists are likely to point out, whose impact should be measured against solar and wind parks rather than coal power plants.

Produced at the company's recently-commissioned factory in Jujurieux, in the Ain department in eastern France, the Dual Spring panel is the most powerful device ever developed by the company to date. “The shingle cells allow the panel to reach a power of 375 Wp while maintaining a completely black aesthetic,” the manufacturer said, noting that the module's previous version could reach a maximum of 315 W.
The 360-cell, monocrystalline PERC panel has dimensions of 1,646×1,140x35mm and a weight of 31.3kg, for the non-insulated version, and 32.1kg for the insulated version. It features a power conversion efficiency of 20%, an open-circuit voltage of 48.9 V, and a short-circuit current of 9.89 A.

The module can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and comes with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 10-year product guarantee. It also features an MC4-compatible connector and black anodized aluminum frame and black backsheet. The product's operating temperature coefficient is -0.34% per degree Celsius.
The thermal-power module has a thermal power of 600 W-thermal per square meter and a gross area of 1.635 m². Its heat-transfer liquid volume is 5 liters and it can operate at a maximum operating pressure of 1.5 bar. The non-insulated device has an optical efficiency of 58.9% and, for the insulated product, this efficiency reaches 58.2%.
The manufacturer claims that the shingle technology used provides better pressure absorption on the panel compared to traditional monocrystalline cells. “Shingle cells are less affected by micro-cracks so the decrease in yield over time is lower,” the company said. “The panels are more durable thanks to the reduction of internal mechanical stress.”

The company–which says it is owned by French renewables business Total Eren, Japanese conglomerate Itochu Corp, Saudi electrical manufacturer Al Gihaz Holding and U.K. financial services firm Winch Partners Ltd–said it will provide funding for the project alongside Neot Offgrid Africa and Nairobi and San Francisco-based impact investor Sunfunder, with the support of the U.K. and German governments and the EU. Neot Offgrid Africa was established by Paris-based investor Meridiam, French state-controlled energy company EDF and Japanese brand Mitsubishi.
The project will see the roll-out of Winch Energy's Remote Power Unit mini-grid solution in the districts of Tonkolili, Koinadugu and Bombali, in the West African state of Sierra Leone, and in the Lamwo area of Uganda, on the eastern side of the continent.
Winch said the projects would be operational within a year for more than 6,500 customers and would supply clean energy to more than 60,000 people for the first time, with an additional 6,000 portable batteries bringing sustainable energy to people outside the mini-grid catchment areas.
“The developments will open up a pipeline of additional projects in both countries, further securing Winch Energy’s position in the off-grid market,” the investor said in a press release issued yesterday to announce a project which, Winch added, was signed off in late January. The two project partners are aiming to have $100 million worth of operational projects within two years, said Winch.
African debt-funding investor Sunfunder will provide a $2 million construction loan for the project, said Winch, with the U.K. government's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office providing unspecified “subsidies” for the project in Sierra Leone, and German development ministry the BMZ (Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung) providing the same support for the Ugandan locations, alongside the EU.
Project development support will be offered in Uganda by German development agency GIZ (the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit) with the equivalent service offered in Sierra Leone by the UN Office for Project Services, according to yesterday's announcement.
Winch added, French broadband and smart grid company Sagemcom will be one of two main contractors–along with Winch Energy's Italian unit. Fieldfisher; Clarkson Wright and Jakes; and August Debouzy were legal advisers for the establishment of the Winch Energy IPP Holdings Limited investment platform set up with Neot Offgrid Africa to finance the mini-grid operations.

Despite these constraints, the Italian large scale PV segment has never come to a halt and several projects, PPAs, and project acquisitions were announced in recent years and months.
This week, two more projects were announced and one of them, planned for unspecified areas in the southern region of Sicily, is being planned on an unprecedented scale for the Italian market and is poised to become the country's largest solar power plant when completed.
The 700 MW solar park is being planned by Germany-based power company Steag and German independent investment and asset manager KGAL. “The plant is located in various places in the provinces of Palermo and Trapani,” a Steag spokesperson told pv magazine. “The construction will start in the third quarter of 2021 and the plant will be grid-connected during autumn 2022.”
The company did not say if the project has completed the approval process but specified that the plant will not be deployed on agricultural land. The facility, which was originally planned to have a capacity of 440 MW, is expected to generate 1,400 GWh every year.
The second solar park announced this week is a 78 MW project that U.K.-based solar developer Lightsource BP acquired from Sicily-based EGI for an undisclosed sum.
“The company will work in partnership with EGI to bring the project to ready-to-build status, having recently filed for ‘PAUR', a comprehensive permit granting authorization on environmental and planning matters,” the U.K. company said. “Lightsource BP will then continue to progress the project to financial close and begin construction in 2022, with an expectation for the site to become operational in 2023.”
Lightsource said the new project will raise the capacity of its PV project pipeline in Italy to 1.2 GW. “The sites in this geographically balanced portfolio have been carefully chosen with specific attention to their impact on surrounding areas, incorporating environmental mitigation strategies to ensure local support,” the company stated.
No details were provided for either project, in terms of electricity sales. With plants of this scale, the combination of bilateral PPAs and the sale of power on the spot market is a likely solution.

They fabricated the device with luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) based on poly(naphthalene‐alt‐vinylene), or PVN, which is a conjugated polymer compound that can absorb and emit red light and, at the same time, absorb light in a range of colors.
“The trick is that, as a waveguide, it accepts light from any direction but restricts how it leaves, concentrating it onto the solar cells that convert it to electricity,” said researcher Yilin Li.
They tested the solar window under outdoor direct sunlight and indoor diffuse light‐emitting diode (LED) light. Their tests showed power conversion efficiencies of up to 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively.
“Even indoors, if you hold up a panel, you can see very strong photoluminescence on the edge,” Li said.
The scientists explained that conjugated polymers may be unstable and degrade quickly. They used a device with improved features, adding that in future applications, they want to develop special polymers for both stability and desired optical properties.
“The polymers can even be printed in patterns in the panels, so they can be turned into artwork,” Li said.
The academics also simulated the energy yield from windowpanes as large as 120 inches square. They found that such panels provide less energy, but still enough to cover some electricity of households.
They presented the LSC technology in “High‐performance hybrid luminescent‐scattering solar concentrators based on a luminescent conjugated polymer,” which was recently published in Polymer International. “This study suggests that high‐performance LSCs can be achieved through luminescent conjugated polymers,” the researchers concluded.
Researchers in the Netherlands recently said the lack of a universal standard is preventing luminescent solar concentrators from being widely adopted, either as photonic devices or for the improvement of PV module performance. This technology can be integrated into finished solar panels with no need to modify their electronic structure, which helps them to collect high-energy photons that they fail to harvest. If applied to PV, LCSs can capture high-energy photons that the photovoltaic panels cannot absorb and then re-emit them as photons of lower energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/18/global-hydrogen-project-pipeline-expected-to-exceed-300-billion-by-2030/,"GEOPOLITICS,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",Global hydrogen project pipeline expected to exceed $300 billion by 2030,"According to a new report by the Hydrogen Council, the release of national hydrogen strategies by over 30 countries has led to a rapid increase in the volume of investment in hydrogen projects worldwide. The Hydrogen Council is made up of 109 constituent members, representing in excess of US$8.8 trillion in market capitalization and including companies such as BP, Shell, Siemens Energy, Toyota, Anglo American, Snam, and Fortescue. 
The report, developed in collaboration with McKinsey & Company and entitled “Hydrogen Insights 2021: A Perspective on Hydrogen Investment, Deployment and Cost Competitiveness”, estimates the total investment in hydrogen projects will surpass $300 billion by 2030, including US$80 billion in mature projects. Of course, these figures, it should be noted, assume all announced projects are successfully achieved. 
This $300 billion is made up of 228 large-scale projects announced in the value chain, of which 85% are in Europe, Asia and Australia. These projects are not all massive generation projects like the 26 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub in Western Australia, but also transport applications, infrastructure, and large-scale industrial usage projects. 
In fact, it is in these latter sectors that the Hydrogen Council expects to see hydrogen become the most competitive fuel source. The report finds that hydrogen “can become the most competitive low-carbon solution in more than 20 applications by 2030, including long-haul trucking, shipping and steel.” 

According to Daryl Wilson, Executive Director of the Hydrogen Council, members are collectively “planning a sixfold increase in total hydrogen investments through 2025 and a 16-fold increase through 2030. The plan is to direct most of this investment toward capital expenditures, while collaborations, consolidations and innovation will also be a key focus.”
Clusters
The report particularly highlights the importance of hydrogen project deployment in clusters. Martin Tengler, BloombergNEF's Lead Hydrogen Analyst, told pv magazine very much the same thing. Clusters are “the natural places to start with hydrogen,” Tengler says, “you're going to have to start small, some kind of industrial cluster that takes a lot of natural gas…especially if they are already using hydrogen, like refinery clusters, fertilizer factories etc.” 
According to the report, there are three types of clusters and all are on the increase. The first is, as Tengler said, industrial centers already supporting refining, power generation, and fertilizer and steel production. The second is export hubs in resource-rich countries, which is to say, countries rich in solar and wind. And thirdly, port facilities.
Australia is already leading the way in this regard after the recent establishment of a network of 13 clusters. 
Decarbonization 
If these clusters can be nurtured and transitioned then the future hydrogen economy flowing between production hubs in the Middle East, North Africa, South America and Australia will be able to trade with demand centers such as Japan, South Korea, and the European Union. 
Moreover, the scaling of green hydrogen will help make significant inroads for emissions reduction. As Takeshi Uchiyamada, Chairman of the Board of the Toyota Motor Corporation and Co-chair of the Hydrogen Council put it, “Hydrogen can help to unlock deep decarbonization and achieve global climate targets.”

How rapidly this scaling can be achieved and a global hydrogen economy established is another matter. The cost of renewables and electrolysis continues to fall, but as Tengler points out, first we need to see domestic production and consumption of green hydrogen. “Even though there is a lot of talk about shipping etc., we are going to start first with small projects done domestically on site… Only once you've got a couple of hubs might you start seeing networks, but they will be limited at first… I would expect first local production and local consumption.”

Although most economies were hit by various efforts to curb the global pandemic, some countries with more lenient restrictions for energy storage installers performed stronger than expected in the second quarter.
Germany provides a standout example, having now delivered quarter-on-quarter growth in residential storage installations for eight consecutive quarters (Q4 2018 – Q3 2020). Shipment data for the first three quarters of 2020 amounts to nearly 850 MWh and more than 90,000 systems, compared to 741 MWh and 85,000 systems during the whole of 2019. However, many of these systems shipped earlier in the year will not be installed until the fourth quarter or later.
IHS Markit predicts that a strong fourth quarter in Germany will lead to it overtaking Japan to become the largest residential market for the first time. In part, this sustained growth has been driven by homeowners choosing to invest in their homes instead of traveling or taking vacations, as options to travel were significantly restricted, and by local subsidy schemes supporting the uptake of rooftop solar and energy storage.
During this time, the German market has also seen a shift in leading players, as domestic suppliers E3/DC, Senec, and Sonnen performed strongly. Together, they accounted for more than 52% of the market in the first three quarters of 2020. At the same time as these changes in market dynamics, a trend which IHS Markit previously highlighted was coming to fruition, as Li-ion iron phosphate (LFP) tech has gained traction and become the favored battery chemistry.
The United States had a strong start to the year, with more than 15,000 systems shipped in the first quarter (a 66% increase on Q1 2019). This was helped by concerns about wildfires ahead of the summer, which have led to power outages. Shipments continued to rise in the second quarter, as state restrictions in California (the largest market in the United States) allowed the installation of solar and/or residential energy storage systems to continue. As the summer arrived, utility Pacific Gas & Electric took a cautious approach to managing its network and implemented rolling outages as a method of mitigating against the potential risk of wildfires following the disaster in 2019, which sent it into bankruptcy. These outages saw many homeowners turning to solar and storage, leading to record quarterly shipments of 317 MWh (over 25,000 systems) shipped in the third quarter.
IHS Markit also tracked a new trend in the U.S. residential sector. Systems able to provide full home backup were selling faster than those that provide only partial backup. This is one factor that helped Tesla to secure a dominant share of the market in 2020. An additional factor was the acquisition of Vivint Solar by Sunrun. Vivint Solar had historically been a strong sales channel for LG Energy Solutions (formerly LG Chem), but is now merged with Sunrun, which favors Tesla solutions for residential energy storage.
Lockdown restrictions across Europe saw many residential energy storage markets stall sharply – notably Italy and the United Kingdom. However, there was no significant reduction in shipments, as international suppliers continued to ship systems.
The Lombardy region of Italy, which would typically see a large volume of storage installations, went into total lockdown, along with neighboring regions (and eventually the entire country). This resulted in almost no installations in the second quarter. However, shipments continued to arrive in anticipation of a market recovery. As restrictions were relaxed, uptake increased, driven by Lombardy’s renewed subsidy scheme and a new EcoBonus (110% tax credit) that started in July. This has allowed for the market to recover, and so far unit shipments in the first three quarters of 2020 are only 7% lower than for the whole of 2019.
The United Kingdom saw a similar reaction to Covid-19, as many installers took advantage of the government’s furlough scheme to reduce their workforce as lockdown went into force. Shipments did continue, however, with varied levels of restrictions remaining in place. And with no direct incentives for residential storage installations, they have taken a significant hit in 2020, with IHS Markit predicting a 37% decrease in shipments in 2020, compared to 2019.
After a challenging year, the global residential energy storage market will accelerate in 2021, and IHS Markit forecasts that global installations will grow by 27% compared to 2020. This will be aided by the ongoing recovery of the global economy, specific incentives for energy storage, and a continued desire for self-consumption for rooftop solar owners. Several other key market developments are also predicted to take place this year.
Germany will reinforce its position as the largest residential market, having surpassed Japan and the United States in 2020. New markets in Europe, such as Spain and Belgium, will see an acceleration, following the European Union’s clean energy initiative and stimulus packages.
And on the technology side, LFP battery chemistry will continue to grow in strength and popularity, as long as demand from the automotive sector does not grow faster than anticipated and affect availability. Integration with home management systems and the smart charging of electric vehicles (EVs) will also emerge as new drivers for homeowners to install residential energy storage systems.

The global utility-scale energy storage market is on track for a record year in 2021, with the United States continuing to lead the way.
According to a new report from IHS Markit, global utility-scale energy storage installations are set to surpass 10 GW for the first time this year. That’s more than double the 4.5 GW installed in 2020.
Notably, the report does not include smaller commercial or residential energy storage installations. However, the deployment of such projects has also risen in line with distributed solar adoption.
“The energy storage industry will begin significant multiyear growth in 2021, continuing until 2030, as the technology begins to form a core component of power grids in developed markets and new opportunities in developing markets continue to emerge;” said George Hilton, senior analyst of clean technology at IHS Markit.
The report said the United States will account for about 50% of the global utility-scale energy storage market this year. IHS Markit said it expects the country to continue to extend its dominance of the global market. It will likely gain market share until 2023, when the project pipeline is expected to shrink.
However, the report noted that aggressive decarbonization plans in mainland China will lead to rapid growth in the region starting in 2025. This will drive the Asia-Pacific region to account for 44% of global annual installations by 2030.
In Europe, a 70% increase in annual installations will be realized this year. The technology will begin to be used more widely to keep grid frequency stable and reduce the intermittency of renewable energy.
“The global market for energy storage is maturing rapidly,” said Hilton. “The number of countries where annual installations exceed 100 MW will increase from nine in 2020 to 17 in 2022. The three biggest contributors to this growth will be the United States, mainland China, and Australia, which are together forecast to supply 4.5 GW of capacity in 2021.”
IHS Markit also said that solar+storage installations are emerging as a major growth factor for the overall market. Solar+storage installations are capitalizing on recent policy changes in the United States, such as the extension of the solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC). This means that energy storage projects that are co-located with solar will continue to benefit from a reduced tax burden through to 2025.
According to the report, 1.3 GW of tenders have been announced or awarded globally for utility-scale storage systems co-located with solar PV over the past six months. Combined with the impact of the U.S. ITC, IHS Markit said it predicts that 3.8 GW of utility-scale solar+storage will be completed this year. That’s a big leap compared to 0.9 GW in 2020. Of the expected 3.8 GW, 2.5 GW will be in the United States.

Indian Oil Corp. has chosen U.S.-based Dastur International as the leading partner to conduct design and feasibility studies for an industrial carbon capture and utilization project at the Koyali refinery in the Indian state of Gujarat, with a capacity of 13.7 million tons per year. 
The installation will reportedly be India’s largest carbon capture and utilization project. Other partners are Air Liquide and the Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG) at the University of Texas, Austin.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), industrial greenhouse gases (GHG) from steel, cement, fertilizer plants, and refineries account for more than one-quarter of all GHGs and are practical targets for implementing carbon capture and utilization. Enhanced oil recovery is a major use of carbon dioxide to improve oil field recovery rates.
Indian Oil is the country's leading refiner and operates 11 of the nation’s 23 refineries. The refinery at Koyali, near Vadodara, is its flagship site and can capture more than 5,000 tons per day. The carbon dioxide captured from its hydrogen generation units will be primarily used for enhanced oil recovery at the Oil and Natural Gas Commission’s oilfield at Gandhar, Gujarat.

Sydney-listed Province Resources has revealed plans to set up a hybrid solar PV and wind farm near Carnarvon, Western Australia, as part of a proposal to produce renewable hydrogen for domestic and foreign markets.
Province Resources said on Wednesday that its HyEnergy Renewable Hydrogen Project includes plans for a 1 GW wind and solar PV facility. The energy from that project will be used to produce approximately 60,000 tons of green hydrogen per year, or up to 300,000 tons of green ammonia.
“The bulk of the energy will be used for large-scale production of green hydrogen products for domestic and export markets with potentially a smaller proportion of generation capacity to be dedicated to large energy users in the Pilbara region,” Province Resources said.
The Perth-based company announced the plans after revealing that it had entered into a conditional agreement to acquire fellow Western Australia-based outfit Ozexco, which holds seven exploration licence applications in the state's Gascoyne region. Some of the tenements are considered prospective for salt, potash and mineral sands while others could become home to a renewable green hydrogen project.
In a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange, Province Resources said that the location is ideal for the development of a large-scale renewable energy facility. The solar in Carnarvon ranks among the highest irradiance levels in the world, averaging 211 sunny days per year,. with an average solar exposure of 22 Mj or 6.24 kWh per day. And, due to being on the western edge of the continent, it has excellent wind resources.
The region also benefits from low intensity land use and low population density. The existing infrastructure includes the Dampier Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline (DBNGP). But the states’s geographical proximity to Asia is another strategic benefit.
“We believe that the project will contribute significantly to the national, state and local objectives of new investment, new jobs, renewable energy sources and new export markets,” the company said.
It is expected the project will be delivered in three stages. The first stage will include a pilot trial of green hydrogen and green ammonia production. The trial will also investigate potential gas blending into the DBNGP.
The second stage will see the project scaled up to supply into the DBNGP with the aim of helping meet the state government’s objective of up to 10% green hydrogen in the pipeline by 2030. The third stage will deliver full-scale production for both domestic and export markets and the development of a liquified hydrogen loading facility in the Canarvon area.
Province Resources said it will look to start feasibility studies for both renewable power generation and green hydrogen production within the next 12 to 18 months, while also seeking to secure a binding memorandum of understanding with an independent power producer for the wind and solar energy required for the hydrogen production.
The company isn’t the only enterprise eyeing the development of a renewable hydrogen project in Western Australia. The state government has given environmental approval to the first stage of the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, a 15 GW hybrid solar and wind plant. The approval is a massive step forward for the project, which is backed by Sydney-based developer CWP Renewables and Macquarie Group.
Hydrogen Renewables Australia and Denmark Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) have also proposed the development of a renewable hydrogen production facility near Kalbarri. They have detailed plans for up to 5 GW of combined solar and wind projects to supply it.
