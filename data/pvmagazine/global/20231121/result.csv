The Commission already authorised over €17 billion in State Aid for around 80 hydrogen projects across the EU. It has signed hydrogen partnerships with countries ranging from Egypt, Kenya and Namibia, to Latin American countries.“Together with President Lula of Brazil, we are announcing the European Union's support to build one of the biggest hydrogen projects in the world, in the Brazilian State of Piaui.” The European executive is also holding talks with Kazakhstan, Australia and Oman.
Clean Energy Associates (CEA) said it expects a 143% increase in electrolyzer capacity over the next two years. CEA's Hydrogen Electrolyzer Supplier Market Intelligence Report (H1 2023) states that China, Europe, and the United States will lead in growth. Alkaline remains dominant, with Enapter offering the Anion Exchange Member technology. The report highlights Bloom Energy's dominance in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell electrolyzers. “Only one supplier, Enapter, currently offers the Anion Exchange Member (AEM) technology,” said CEA, adding that few suppliers offer multiple technologies. 
Enexis said the first homes in the Dutch village of Wagenborgen have been connected to a newly developed hydrogen network. In the coming weeks, 33 homes in the 1970s neighborhood will transition from natural gas to green hydrogen through the grid. “We are learning here how to distribute hydrogen safely through existing gas pipelines. We are doing that with low and high pressure to learn how that works for homes and industry. If we succeed here, we succeed everywhere,” said Bram Gerrist, director innovation for Enexis, the Dutch grid operator. Essent, a Dutch unit of E.ON, has signed the first hydrogen contracts to supply hydrogen to residents.
Eneco has submitted its planning application to build a green hydrogen production plant in Rotterdam's Europoort industrial area, next to the Enecogen power station in Europoort. “This location means the two facilities can share some infrastructure, which has advantages with regards to costs and realization time,” said Eneco, adding that it is working with Mitsubishi. The plant should “have a capacity of eventually 800 megawatts.” It could produce up to 80 kilotons of hydrogen per year. Construction is expected to start in 2026, and the hydrogen plant is scheduled to begin operating in 2029.
RWE has signed an agreement with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, a subsidiary of Korea's Hyundai Motor Group, to cooperate in offshore wind and green hydrogen projects in South Korea and other parts of the world. The partnership aims to combine Hyundai's hydrogen expertise from its first South Korean electrolysis plant with RWE's knowledge across the entire value chain for future green hydrogen projects, contingent on favorable market conditions, said RWE.
The UK government has revealed plans to launch a hydrogen industry taskforce, in partnership with the Hydrogen Innovation Initiative and Innovate UK. Additionally, a GBP 960 million ($1.2 billion) investment in the Green Industries Growth Accelerator was announced to support the expansion of clean energy supply chains, including carbon capture, utilization and storage, electricity networks, hydrogen, nuclear, and offshore wind. The funding, available from 2025 for five years, will come into effect after the General Election, said the Hydrogen Energy Association.
Evonik has signed a license agreement with Fuhua to build a new hydrogen peroxide plant in Leshan, China's Sichuan province, using the know-how of the German chemicals company. The collaboration will evaluate the joint production and marketing of specialty grades of hydrogen peroxide to meet the rising demand in the Chinese market. Fuhua plans to construct an industrial-grade hydrogen peroxide plant with an annual capacity of 200 kilotons.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/21/fike-unveils-new-solution-to-suppress-battery-storage-fire-thermal-runaway/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023","Fike unveils new solution to suppress battery storage fire, thermal runaway","Preventing thermal runaway – a rapid and dangerous release of heat and gases which can lead to fires in lithium-ion batteries – is the big conundrum plaguing both electric mobility and stationary storage industries. With battery thermal incidents a relatively new phenomenon, companies are wrapping their heads around suppression methods and the best ways of dealing with self-sustaining battery fires that are difficult to put out.
The latest company that claims to have found a solution to this issue is US-based Fike Corp. Its Fike Blue solution is billed as “the first tested and patented solution that not only suppresses the fire but also stops cascading thermal runaway.”
Fike has developed a tank with a liquid that has a boiling point of more than 400 C without breaking down.  When a heat anomaly is detected, a releasing panel activates the cylinder to flow Fike Blue throughout the piping network. However, only in the module where the fire is located will the nozzle open and discharge the liquid, immersing the cells and absorbing the heat. The temperatures for all cells dramatically decrease over the course of several minutes until the event and chance for re-ignition is over.
Fike said it has various ways to detect thermal events in battery energy storage systems.
“Depending on the users' goals, we can use multiple detection options including industrial gas detection, Fike Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) cables, traditional spot detection, and more,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
For these detection methods, a SHP Pro or Fike Cheetah Xi fire panel is necessary, connecting to the battery management system (BMS) to halt charging circuits upon thermal event detection and activate local notification systems.
Today, water-based fire suppression systems are touted as most effective at cooling a battery fire. However, while they can cool down the battery and help prevent the spread of fire, they cannot extinguish battery fires until the energy is dissipated and accompanied by the release of dangerous off-gases. The possibility of re-ignition is not eliminated.
Fike's solution uses significantly less liquid than sprinklers and firefighters, reducing runoff into the environment. The agent is said to be “far less conductive than water, as all tests performed either by Fike or by a third party have yet to witness the shorting of any cells.”
Third-party testing by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) showed that Fike Blue suppressed thermal runaway heat within five minutes, preventing further cell spread. While it has not specified the chemical composition of its agent, Fike said that its does not fall under the family of PFAS. It said its patented liquid can be stored for at least five years at 25 C without the formation of precipitates or sediment.
“Fike is the only safety solutions provider in the world who can perform a Battery Hazard Analysis (BHA) with Fike Blue, ensuring you’ll pass the UL 9540A test [test method for evaluating thermal runaway fire propagation in battery energy storage systems],” Fike said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/21/self-financed-solar-array-destroyed-in-lebanese-farming-village/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,LEBANON,MIDDLE EAST",ANGELA SKUJINS,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023",Self-financed solar array destroyed in Lebanese farming village,"Kassem Ghorayeb told pv magazine today that the panels and the control room comprising the Tair Harfa solar project were allegedly “bombed” by Israeli forces earlier this month. As it currently stands, the site, located on the outskirts of the Lebanese community which is 5 kilometers north of the Israeli border, is a reduced heap of scrap metal.
“I am now trying to think of ways to rebuild,” said Ghorayeb, an assistant professor at the American University of Beirut’s Chemical Engineering and Advanced Energy Department. “We cannot afford to fail. People are now being taken by fear because they are fearing for their lives.”
Ghorayeb, born and raised in Tair Harfa but now living in the country’s capital, conceived with some friends the idea to build a 100 kW solar array on the edge of the town in 2021. The project was driven by a need to provide Tair Harfa’s families – mostly farmers – with affordable water, Ghorayeb said.
“The [government] collapse that happened two or three years ago in Lebanon means we can no longer afford generators, especially poor people,” he said, referring to the 2019 Lebanese economic crisis which left many in poverty and without stable electricity. Villagers relied on hiring expensive diesel generators to pump water or purchased pricey water outright for their household needs, he said.
Seeing the need for cheap water, the project organizers hatched a plan to build a solar array that would power the plumbing. They raised roughly 80% of the project’s total $130,000 costs through community fundraising, with the final portion of funding borrowed on loan from a local business owner.
The solar array was finally switched on in September 2022. “People were happy,” Ghorayeb said, adding that the move was “unprecedented.” Residents used the water for general household needs and irrigated their small gardens, but it also revolutionized how the community accessed water and energy, he said.

More than 400 of the village’s families paid roughly $3 per month to access the service, Ghorayeb said. The plant, located on the top of a hill, consisted of roughly 200, 540 W panels that harvested PV energy to pump water from a well 300 meters underground to the village. The array was operational from 8 am to 4 pm in the summertime, with a control room affixed to the site for monitoring.
But on Nov. 3, 2023, Israeli forces allegedly destroyed the power plant, Ghorayeb said.
“We spent a year building it but then it maybe took one second to be demolished,” he said. “There is no question that it was hit from the Israeli side.”
pv magazine sent inquiries to the Israeli press department asking whether it was behind the attack but did not get a response.
The Israeli army has reportedly used its warplanes to strike Hezbollah targets on the outskirts of Lebanon, Reuters reports.
The Tair Harfa solar site, located on the lip of the country's south, is currently a warped mountain of modules and metal. Alongside the project, Ghorayeb alleges “a couple” of community houses have been flattened due to the fighting. Some people have fled the village while others without the financial means to escape have remained, he said.
Ghorayeb has launched a subsequent GoFundMe campaign to try to raise another $130,000 to rebuild the solar array. He is aware, however, that as a war is being waged in Gaza many people may “not be thinking” about donating money to a Lebanese solar project.
“Only us who have been campaigning hard and patiently to gather the money are aware of the consequences,” he said. “The consequences are very dire here in terms of how are we going to rebuild.”
Luckily it is currently raining, Ghorayeb said, meaning residents can fill up their water-collecting drums and not rely on expensive water produced from diesel generators. But the weather may not always be so fortuitous. “It took one year at the beginning, last year, to build,” Ghorayeb said. “I am afraid it may take longer now.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/21/netherlands-combats-grid-overcapacity-with-flexible-contracts-for-pv-owners/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023",Netherlands combats grid overcapacity with flexible contracts for PV owners,"Dutch transmission system operator Enexis has awarded a “capacity limitation” contract to a 5.6 MW solar plant. It said the deal was the second contract of its kind to be granted to a renewable energy plant operator, following similar contract in November 2022 for a 10 MW wind farm operated by Dutch energy company Eneco.
Enexis said the 5.6 MW solar farm is owned and operated by pet food manufacturer E.J. Bos in Vianen, in Brabant province.
“A CBC is a form of congestion management that allows the electricity grid to be used more efficiently,” Enexis said in a statement. “At peak times we ask the solar park to inject less electricity into the grid. In return, we pay compensation for this form of rush hour avoidance.”
CBCs can be granted in the Netherlands by congestion service providers (CSPs) acting as intermediaries, in order to make optimal use of the available space on the network.
The existing regulations permit grid operators to negotiate agreements with market entities on the frequency and cost of assisting in peak reduction. Additionally, CSPs serve as independent service providers between the network operator and connected customers.
The Netherlands needs to address grid constraints, as high volumes of solar capacity will be deployed in the years ahead. Over the past two years, Dutch power supplier Liander has implemented a number of measures to increase grid capacity in several areas facing grid constraints. These measures include the deployment of two giant transformers and congestion management for grid bottlenecks.
More recently, Dutch electricity transmission system operator Tennet said it would invest €13 billion ($13.3 billion) to expand the national high-voltage grid. The plan includes the construction of 40 new onshore high-voltage stations across every province.
In January 2019, Tennet and Enexis warned for the first time that there was extremely limited capacity for more solar in the provinces of Groningen, Drenthe and Overijssel.

In the first 10 months of this year, the country added 142.5 GW of new PV systems, with 13.62 GW deployed in October alone. New solar power installations hit 78.42 GW in China at the end of June.
State Power Investment Corp. (SPIC) has kicked off the construction of a 1,000 MW ground-mounted solar farm in Hotan, in China's Xinjiang region. The project will include 100 MW/200 MWh of energy storage and a 220 kV convergent booster station. It will be implemented in three phases across 16.7 square kilometers. The total investment is about CNY 3.85 billion ($541.2 million).
TSUN has raised CNY 150 million in venture capital to expand its manufacturing capacity and core product development. The four-year-old company is expanding internationally with a range of microinverters for the 300 W to 3,000 W power range, as well as a balcony applications.
Yingkou Jinchen Machinery, a PV manufacturing equipment supplier, said it generated CNY 1.73 billion in revenue in the first nine months of this year, up from CNY 1.45 billion for the same period in 2022. Net profit was CNY 74.61 million, up from CNY 54.97 million a year earlier.
Trina Solar said it has signed a memorandum of understanding with Marubeni Australia and to supply 1.5 GW of its Vertex N modules in the Oceania region.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/21/perc-inventor-discusses-the-future-of-the-technology/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023",PERC inventor discusses the future of the technology,"pv magazine: What role do you feel PERC will play in the longer term now that alternative technology such as tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), heterojunction (HJT) and back-contact solar are vying to displace PERC and become the next mainstream PV choice?
Aihua Wang: The solar industry is developing rapidly. The pace of technology development is faster than ever, which puts pressure on the industry to find ways to increase efficiency, scale up and reduce costs. PERC cells’ low manufacturing cost and high performance means they have the majority market share.
Over the past 35 years, PERC cell research has underpinned significant progress and paved the way for new materials, processes, and structures such as TOPCon and HJT – technologies that bring further advantages.
I can envision that as the industry continues to progress and its scale increases, new technologies will continue to emerge and evolve. Nevertheless, the fundamental principles that have proven to be so effective for PERC cell technology also apply to these new structural innovations.
Do you think perovskite solar devices will ever become a viable, mass-produced option for solar power generation?
Perovskite solar cell technology has developed rapidly within a short timeframe. Ongoing research efforts are focused on enhancing stability, scalability, and overall performance. In contrast to silicon, perovskite materials exhibit sensitivity to moisture, potentially leading to degradation over time. Addressing stability and scaling issues is therefore paramount but such efforts require time and cost efficiency. There is a lot yet to be discovered with perovskite solar technology but it is a novel and promising method.
What is your experience as a female engineer in the solar sector?
Personally, I try not to pay much attention to my gender. In a competitive environment, special treatment ought not to be the norm. However, within the semiconductor industry, of which solar cell technology is a part, female engineers who I’ve worked with have shared several traits that provide an advantage in this discipline. Whether it is their impressive attention to detail, an instinctive understanding of when the direction of an experiment or observation needs to change, or the tenacious pursuit of the goal, I know many female engineers who are as consistently brilliant as their male counterparts.
I have had the privilege of knowing many brilliant female engineers in the solar sector who collectively drive rapid progress in the industry.
My goal has always been to perform my job and work together with fellow researchers to the best of my abilities. Australia and its institutions have provided many opportunities to pursue my goals and the QEPrize has recognized me and my colleagues for achieving them. For this, I am eternally grateful.
 What does it mean to be the first female winner of the QEPrize?
There are a lot of bright and talented young women in every corner of the globe but it is true that only a small proportion pursue careers in engineering. Accomplished female engineers who have achieved success in our profession can serve as role models not only to aspiring engineers but to all young people who are curious and who want to make an impact and have fun while doing so. Making female-led accomplishments in science and engineering more visible is vital if we are to inspire a new generation of women in engineering – hence the importance of accolades like the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. Our discipline will not reach its full potential without more women in the sector and so I hope that more are encouraged to achieve remarkable things through engineering, cultivating a brighter future and making contributions to both their communities and humanity. As the first female recipient of the QEPrize, I hope that this achievement increases the visibility of women in engineering and inspires more brilliant minds to explore the boundless realm of creativity within this field.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/21/statkraft-bets-on-mix-of-renewables-for-hydrogen-production/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NORWAY,SWEDEN,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023",Statkraft bets on mix of renewables for hydrogen production,"Statkraft said it sees a lot of momentum in the hydrogen space across Europe, but “few actual investment decisions so far as the EU regulatory challenges are complicating the development.” The Norwegian company has proposed a number of “clarifications” to current legislation, underscoring the importance of “improving electrolysis economics” by using diversified renewable energy portfolios instead of single renewable assets.
Statkraft said the full-load hours for solar are between 800 to 2,000 hours per year, depending on where projects are in Europe. 
“But this doesn't mean that one can use the full generation of a solar plant for a hydrogen plant, as it would require massive over-sizing of your hydrogen plant, which would not be economic,” said Norway's largest energy producer. “In our view, hydrogen projects should be able to tap into different renewable energy sources.”
To achieve a 40% utilization rate of the electrolyzer from a single solar plant, the project would need to be oversized by a factor of five in relation to the electrolyzer capacity, according to Statkraft's analysis of production data from new solar plants.
“When doing so, more than half of your solar production will be excess production that needs to be sold back to the market when prices tend to be very low,” said Simon Kornek, vice president for southern Europe at Statkraft.
When mixing onshore wind and solar, the situation reportedly improves.
“Combining single onshore wind and solar plants improve the utilization rate of the electrolyser to up to 60%, but it would still result in 20% excess production,” said Kornek.
According to Statkraft, hydropower from large reservoirs is the closest to a cost-competitive power source that can be derived as a stable 24/7 baseload supply over most of the year.  
“In Scandinavia, where power markets are already largely carbon-free, hydrogen projects can tap into existing hydropower,” said Kornek.
Statkraft has signed four power purchase agreements (PPAs) for hydrogen production, with projects located in Sweden, Norway, and Germany. The company will supply renewable electricity to H2 Green Steel's project in Boden, Sweden, the Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) Holmaneset green hydrogen and green ammonia project in Norway (with a capacity of 300MW), and Air Liquide's 20MW green hydrogen water-electrolysis plant in Germany.
Despite the majority of electricity markets differing from the Scandinavian model, Statkraft, Europe's largest producer of renewable energy, aims to leverage their diversified renewable portfolios across Europe to supply eleoctrolysis projects.
Statkraft said several business models will coexist. Big energy-intensive processes will need stable hydrogen supplies, power supplies and significant amounts of storage. Other projects might work with lower utilization rates and produce when electricity prices are low. Use cases in the transportation sector will offer more flexibility if they come with decentralized refueling stations and storage.
Kornek agrees with other experts that storage and transportation will be the primary drivers of the change leading to a commoditized market. A flexible market will emerge in the next 15 to 20 years. But he is worried by the legislative developments. 
Statkraft's Kornek said that companies did not proceed with many investment decisions because of the “EU regulatory challenges.” Kornek adds that a first indication of the impact of the new rules will emerge more clearly in the coming 12 to 24 months. 
“The Delegated Act as currently written makes it very complicated to realize the green hydrogen targets in Europe. In particular, the strict requirements on additionality, temporality, and geographical correlation will be extremely difficult to comply with and will make green hydrogen more expensive than necessary,” Kornek told pv magazine.
Kornek stated that involving a credit-worthy integrator for the PPAs enables the project sponsor to secure more affordable financing through non-recourse project financing, utilizing only the project's cash flow as bank security.
Statkraft is seeking clarification on the role of “intermediaries” as defined in the European Commission’s delegated regulation (EU) 2023/1184, stating that intermediaries can play a role in green hydrogen project PPAs.
“Already today, we face caution from the side of potential hydrogen producers to conclude PPAs for hydrogen production,” said Kornek. “It is therefore of utmost importance to accept PPAs with an intermediary as a contracting party either through adapting the Q&A document or, ideally, through amending the definition according to RED III (2023/2413).”
From Statkraft's point of view, intermediaries such as utilities, traders and aggregators, are more than facilitators and will be crucial to accelerating the build-out of green hydrogen projects in Europe.
“Intermediary companies play a crucial role in integrating intermittent renewable energy in the market, warehousing and managing energy risks as well as leveraging portfolio effects,” it said. “Thereby they improve the overall market efficiency. Intermediary companies are contracting parties and not only facilitators of the PPA contracts.”
According to Pexapark’s PPA tracker, 38% of the 48 GW of PPAs that have been published since 2018, are so-called utility/trader PPAs concluded with an intermediary company.
According to Statkraft, a well-functioning market is the most effective tool to ensure profitability in renewable energy and, thus, the best facilitator for developing new renewable power production and hydrogen projects.

There was no homogeneous trending change in the main European electricity market's solar energy production in the week of Nov. 13 compared to the previous week. Solar energy production increased by 19% in Portugal, 18% in Italy and 16% in Spain. The opposite behavior occurred elsewhere, with German solar energy production falling 34% and the French solar energy production dipping 6.6%.
The Spanish market produced 84 GWh using solar photovoltaic energy on Nov. 19 – the highest capacity since Oct. 21 when Spain generated 89 GWh. Production was also the highest in history for November.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting's solar energy production forecasts estimate PV energy will increase in Germany and Spain, but it will decrease in Italy for the week of Nov. 20.

 

Wind energy production decreased in most of the analyzed European markets during the week of Nov. 13 compared to the previous week. The decrease ranged from 68% in the Portuguese market to 6.3% in the German market. Other markets saw an increase, however, with the Italian market recording a 33% wind energy generation increase and the French markets recording 3.5%.
Despite the inter‑week decline the German market produced 910 GWh using wind energy on Nov. 14 – the highest recorded capacity since mid‑March.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s wind energy production forecasts indicate that wind production will increase in the Iberian Peninsula for the week of Nov. 20 and will decrease in the remaining markets.

Electricity demand
For the week of Nov. 13 there was no uniform change of trends for the main European markets when compared to the previous week. Electricity demand increased in Germany and Italy by 1%, 1.6% in Belgium and 5.5% in the Netherlands. Demand fell in the other markets, ranging from 2.7% in France and Portugal to 1.2% in Great Britain.
Most of the analyzed markets registered an increase in average temperatures in the third week of November compared to the week of Nov. 6. Increases ranged from 0.5 °C in the Netherlands to 1.9 °C in Spain. In Italy, average temperatures remained similar to those of the previous week. On the other hand, average temperatures decreased by 0.4 °C in Germany – the only market with decreases.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s demand forecasts indicate that electricity demand will increase in most of the analyzed markets in the week of Nov. 20. Only the German and Dutch markets will register lower demand.

European electricity markets
Daily prices in the main European electricity markets progressively increased during the week of Nov. 13. On Friday, Nov. 17, prices exceeded €115/MWh in all markets analyzed by AleaSoft Energy Forecasting. Over the weekend prices dropped, however, resulting in lower weekly averages for some markets.
The IPEX market of Italy increased by 4.3%, the Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries jumped by 26% and the MIBEL market of Portugal and Spain grew by 48% and 49%, respectively. In contrast in the remaining markets, prices declined between 2.5% in the EPEX SPOT market of Germany and 8.8% in the EPEX SPOT market of France.
In the third week of November weekly averages were below €95/MWh in most of the analyzed European electricity markets. The exceptions were the N2EX market of the United Kingdom with prices of €101.97/MWh, and Italy at €126.73/MWh. In contrast, the French market registered the lowest average price of €83.48/MWh. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices ranged from €84.35/MWh in the Portuguese market to €91.51/MWh in the Nordic market.
The Nordic market reached a price of €180.01/MWh from 17:00 to 18:00 on Thursday, Nov 16. This market price was the highest since the first half of March. On the other hand, the German, Belgian, French and Dutch markets registered hourly prices below €2/MWh on Nov. 14 and 19. In the case of the German market, on Tuesday, Nov. 14, there were three hours with negative prices.
During the week of Nov. 13, the increase in the average price of gas and CO2 emission rights had an upward influence on European market prices. Over the weekend, the combination of lower demand and high renewable energy production helped prices fall in most markets. In the case of the French market, wind energy production increased and demand fell for the week as a whole. This contributed to this market registering the lowest weekly average.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s price forecasts indicate that in the fourth week of November prices in most European electricity markets might increase. Declining wind energy production and rising demand in most markets might contribute to this behavior. However, the increase in wind energy production in the Iberian Peninsula might lead to lower prices in the MIBEL market.

Brent, fuels and CO2
On Monday, Nov. 13, Brent oil futures for the Front‑Month in the ICE market registered their weekly maximum settlement price, $82.52/bbl. This price was 3.1% lower than the previous Monday. In the following days of the third week of Nov. prices declined to reach the weekly minimum settlement price, $77.42/bbl, on Thursday, Nov. 16. This price was 3.2% lower than the previous Thursday and the lowest since the first half of July. On Friday, prices increased again. On that day, the settlement price was $80.61/bbl. This settlement price was 1.0% lower than the previous Friday.
In the third week of November, high supply levels, rising US stockpiles and negative data on US economic evolution exerted their downward influence on Brent oil futures prices. Concerns about demand in China also contributed to the price decline. However, expectations of further production cuts by OPEC boosted prices in the last session of the third week of November.
On Monday, Nov. 13, TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front‑Month reached the weekly maximum settlement price, €47.87/MWh. This price was 6.8% higher than the previous Monday. However, according to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, prices started to decline on Tuesday. As a result, on Friday, Nov. 17, they registered the weekly minimum settlement price of €45.06/MWh. This price was 3.4% lower than the previous Friday. For the week as a whole, the average was 0.9% above that of the previous week.
During the third week of November, high European reserve levels and mild temperatures in Europe contributed to the decline in these futures prices. However, fears of possible supply disruptions due to instability in the Middle East and lower temperatures might exert an upward influence on prices in the coming days.
As for CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2023, on Monday, Nov. 13, they registered a settlement price of €77.48/t. This price was 1.6% lower than the last session of the previous week but 2.2% higher than the previous Monday. On Tuesday and Wednesday, prices increased.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/21/physics-based-model-to-predict-soiling-losses-in-bifacial-solar-modules/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ASIA,INDIA",LIOR KAHANA,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023",Physics-based model to predict soiling losses in bifacial solar modules,"Researchers from the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur’s (IIEST Shibpur) have developed a novel physics-based model to estimate dust accumulation on the front and rear surfaces of bifacial modules.
“This model is equally applicable for both rooftop plant and commercial ones,” researcher Saheli Sengupta told pv magazine. “In India, a larger plant with bifacial modules is not yet available and hence we could not validate the model for the larger set-up. But this is in our research program to carry out the same for larger plants from India and abroad.”
The proposed model considers a few input parameters such as particulate matter (PM) concentration, panel tilt, the sun’s angle of incident, solar radiation, albedo, and PV module specifications. It also considers weather parameters such as wind direction, speed, and ambient temperature.
“The considerations made in this analysis are that the shape of the particles is assumed to be spherical; the dust deposition over the module is considered to be uniform; and the effect of different composition of dust is not considered separately,” said the academics.
The model calculates dust accumulation on the front surface of the PV module by considering deposition, rebound, and resuspension phenomena. Deposition involves dust landing on the surface, rebound occurs when particles bounce back into the air, and resuspension involves settled particles lifted by mechanisms like wind and air turbulence.
The model then calculates dust accumulation on the rear surface, taking into account deposition, rebound, and resuspension phenomena. Different types of particle deposition on the back are considered, including particles moving along with airflow and particles lifted from the ground surface.
Following this, the model calculates transmittance, assessing the material's ability to allow light passage, based on previous results. By summing beam radiation, diffuse radiation, and ground-reflected radiation, the model determines the energy yield of the PV plant.
Testing their physical model, the researchers have compared its projected results to real observation on a 10 kW PV system. The array was stationed on the rooftop of a university building located in the Indian city of Howrah, West Bengal.
“It is observed that surface density of dust on back surface for 34 days is 0.08 g/m2, for 79 days 0.6 g/m2 and for 126 days 1.8 g/m2, which are deviated from model based calculated ones by 10%, 33.33% and 4.4% respectively,” the researchers said. “The surface density of dust accumulated on the glass based rear surface is about 1/6th of the front glass surface, which is validated by the model also.”
In addition, the scientists found that the error between the observed DC power generation and the calculated one was 5.6% on the back surface and 9.6% on the front.
“It is necessary to validate this model for large capacity bifacial plant at different locations,” the academics concluded.
They introduced their findings in “Physics based modeling of dust accumulation on a bifacial solar PV module for generation loss estimation due to soiling,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Advances.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/21/european-warehouses-to-stock-65-gw-of-excess-modules-by-2023-end/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,EUROPE,WORLD",ANGELA SKUJINS,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023",European warehouses to stock 65 GW of excess modules by 2023-end,"Germany-based market research company EUPD Research forecasts that roughly 65 GW of unsold solar panels will be sitting in EU warehouses at the end of 2023.
The company provided their estimates to pv magazine in an attempt to quantify the hotly debated projected EU solar module stockpile.
Report authors Markus Hoehner, EUPD CEO, and Ali Arfa,  EUPD senior data manager, said in the report that the EU installed roughly 40 GW of new PV systems in 2022 and China imported 87 GW worth of solar modules. The EU's newly installed PV capacity will hit 60 GW by the end of the year, they said in the report, and Chinese panel imports will climb to 100 GW.
“Even by taking the estimation of 100 GW of Chinese exports to the EU-27 by the end of 2023 and assuming 25% of the excess inventory (87.2 GW) will be the normal warehouse flow (around 22 GW), we are dealing with approximately 65 GW of solar PV module excess inventory for 2023,” Hoehner and Arfa said.
“It should be noted that figures such as 47.2 GW excess inventory from 2022 and around 100 GW of Chinese module export by the end of 2023 are not EUPD Research figures,” he added. “According to EUPD methodology, these figures will reduce. These figures are only assumptions and are used for depicting the oversupply issue. We therefore strongly urge the readers to read the full report.”
The comments follow Norwegian consultancy firm Rystad Energy claiming there were 80 GW of PV modules stockpiled in EU warehouses at the end of August 2023, which is double their 40 GW estimation for the end of September 2023.
High-profile solar expert – and pv magazine founder – Karl-Heinz Remmers weighed in on the discussion and refuted the 80 GW figure. He said there was a “normal inventory” of around 8 GW surplus modules in warehouses at that time, and the EU had installed 46 GW of solar at the end of 2022.
The EUPD authors said there had been a “miscalculation” in Remmers’ assertion of 46 GW of PV installed and according to their analysis the figure was 40 GW.
Remmers also based his claim of an estimated 78 GW of Chinese PV exported to the EU by August on figures provided by the London-based think tank, Ember. These figures should have been treated with “caution,” Hoehner and Arfa said.
The duo said that according to their calculations based on “several data points including module export weights” China exported around 66 GW of solar panels to the EU at the end of August. This “obviously reduces the concern for oversupply,” they said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/21/with-china-pv-modules-reaching-record-low-prices-is-there-a-chance-for-local-pv-manufacturing-elsewhere/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023","With China PV modules reaching record low prices, is there a chance for local PV manufacturing elsewhere?","As China PV modules reach record-low prices, having dropped from $ 0.23/W in January 2023 to $ 0.13/W in November 2023, PV manufacturing efforts in Australia, Europe, India, North and South America seem to make little sense.
In the first half of 2023, despite strong shipments exceeding 252 GW, overall PV production capacity utilization averaged 56%, with TOPCon and n-type PERC utilization reaching 80% and 79%, respectively.
With nearly 80% of shipments coming directly from China, 18% from other Southeast Asian countries and less than 2% from the USA and Europe, it is clear that more of the cheap Chinese PV modules can flow to any market that does not impose barriers or taxes to Chinese/Asian PV modules.
This oligopoly raises concerns about the control or influence over the solar supply chain, as well as on the carbon footprint of such PV modules. Economies of scale, supply chain integration, relatively low energy costs and labor productivity make China the most competitive solar module manufacturer worldwide.
The European Parliament is slowly moving towards verifying whether the European financing framework is adequate to achieve European sovereignty of PV module production by 2030, taking into account the entire value chain of the PV industry, which is the only way to achieve the strategic objective of resilient European photovoltaic production.
Solar energy industry associations are present in most countries, with the mandate to represent diverse group interests such as installers, manufacturers and importers of PV modules, inverters, and batteries, as well as retailers, researchers, and lobbyists “who have requested a union of professionals with similar ideas so that all the various interests and concerns of the solar industry could be effectively reflected under one roof.”
In all countries, membership is mainly made up of installers, who are interested in obtaining the cheapest PV equipment possible, regardless of origin, as long as the prices are low, and the quality is acceptable. As the installation of PV systems employs around ten times more people than the entire PV module production value chain, and cheap PV modules are the main driver of the exponential growth in the adoption of PV in most markets, defending local production faces a conflict of interest on the part of these associations.
After a strong move to bring PV production to Europe, the US and India over the past two years, PV module prices in 2023 have made the solar production business in these countries uncompetitive. To reach net-zero emissions, the world will need more diverse supply chains to meet the growing demand for solar modules, and other countries where PV uptake is increasing rapidly, such as Australia and Brazil, have what it takes to be major suppliers.
More than 80% of current global solar PV manufacturing uses technology developed in Australian laboratories. Silicon PV is a very energy-intensive industry: Brazil is a large producer of metallurgical grade silicon, with one of the lowest carbon footprints in electricity production worldwide, which is important for the solar PV image and carbon footprint.
In July 2023, the Australian PV Institute released the study “Silicon to Solar (S2S) Study – Phase 1: Market Assessment Report,” assessing whether parts of, or the entire PV manufacturing value chain can be operational in Australia. The study makes a market assessment of the current PV supply chain and discusses options for increasing manufacturing in Australia. These options must be in line with three guiding principles:
A wide range of industry partners and collaborators has been engaged to ensure that the assessment is as relevant as possible and that the credible future state reflects the conditions under which a rational business would establish manufacturing in Australia.
With tens of thousands of companies employing more than 240 thousand installers and O&M service providers, Brazil has seen more than 1 GW/month of new PV systems coming into operation in 2023. As news about low-cost rooftop PV spread across the more than 80 million consumer units available in the country, and with still “only” around 2 million photovoltaic systems installed on rooftops, there is plenty of room to grow. These installers want the lowest possible prices for PV modules and are lobbying against any measures to protect the small local PV module manufacturing industry that might result in higher PV module prices.
China has gained ground in Brazil, mainly due to the exemption from import taxes, which adds up to a difference of between 30% and 35% in relation to the module manufactured nationally. Brazilian-made PV modules gain competitiveness only in terms of financing, carried out through low-interest credit from the National Bank for Economic and Social Development, but with Chinese modules at $0.13/W or less, even low-interest financing is not enough to make local PV module production competitive.
More creative solutions, which go beyond fees, taxes and subsidies, must be created if local PV module manufacturing is to take place in markets that install dozens of GW of PV per year. An example would be public bidding processes, in which governments would prioritize the national market at levels compatible with local production capacity, and the remainder could be acquired abroad.
From the International Solar Energy Society’s perspective, and the vision of a world with 100% renewable energy for everyone used wisely and efficiently, PV module production should not become an oligopoly and should not be concentrated in one corner of the world.

The scientists said they grew the cell on detachable germanium (Ge) films, which allows the reuse of Ge in other applications, thus reducing production costs. “By ingeniously creating a weak layer between epitaxial layers and a germanium substrate, we unlock the potential for reusing germanium, leading to a significant reduction in both environmental impact and production costs for optoelectronic devices,” Sherbrooke Professor, Maxime Darnon, told pv magazine.
In the paper “High-efficiency GaAs solar cells grown on porous germanium substrate with PEELER technology,” published in RRL Solar, the research team explained that, in order to create this weak layer, it used the so-called PEELER technique, a novel electrochemical porosification technique originally used for silicon wafers.
“The versatility of the PEELER process extends far beyond the realm of traditional solar cell technology,” Darnon said. “From its foundational application in producing high-efficiency solar cells that redefine industry standards to the creation of lightweight and adaptable solar solutions, PEELER opens doors to a myriad of possibilities. Demonstrated with a single-junction solar cell, the concept is applicable to multijunction solar cells. It is perfectly fit for spatial applications where weight and efficiency are paramount. Additionally, the process finds its stride in concentrator photovoltaics, optimizing energy capture in concentrated sunlight environments.”
Utilizing metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), the researchers fabricated a 1 mm2 front-contacted GaAs PV device based on a Ge substrate, the weak Ge layer, an epitaxial Ge layer, the GaAs absorber, a top contact made of nickel (Ni), Ge, and gold (Au), and a contact layer. 
The champion device built with this architecture achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.012 V, a short-circuit current density of 26.28 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 81.98%.
“The demonstrated performance of single-junction GaAs photovoltaic cells on porosified 100 mm Ge wafers not only matches but surpasses state-of-the-art GaAs solar cells fabricated on detachable substrate, showcasing the transformative potential of growing high-efficiency optoelectronic devices on detachable Ge films,” Darnon stated.
The academics said their experiment also showed the compatibility of the porous structure with the MOCVD growth technique, which they claimed confirmed the industrial potential of the proposed approach.
The research group was formed by scientists from Canada's Université de Sherbrooke, Canadian energy project developer Saint-Augustin Canada Electric Inc., and Belgian Germanium materials provider Umicore Electro-Optic Materials.

Construction has commenced on the Wurrumiyanga Solar Infill and Energy Storage Pilot Project, which will deliver 1.2 MW of additional PV and a 3 MWh battery energy storage system for the small town of Wurrumiyanga and already the Northern Territory government is eyeing completion.
The Northern Territory government said the facility at Wurrumiyanga on Bathurst Island, part of the Tiwi Islands about 80 kilometres northwest of Darwin, is expected to begin operations early next year with the installation of the prefabricated solar arrays provided by clean technology innovator 5B now complete.
Sydney-headquartered modular solar array manufacturer 5B said a team of four workers took just four days to deploy 1.2 MW of the company’s prefabricated Maverick system.
5B Chief Strategy Officer Nicole Kuepper-Russell said the project utilises the company’s latest generation high-wind resilient Maverick solar array. With a wind rating of up to 72 meters per second, the system has been specifically designed for cyclone-prone regions like the Tiwi Islands.
“It is also fast to deploy in remote regions,” Kuepper-Russell said. “A deployment team of four unfolded the 1.2 MW 5B solar farm on Bathurst Island in just four days, with mechanical installation, including unpacking, staging, cabling, the extra anchoring required for wind region C and clean up, taking less than two weeks.”
The solar array is part of the AUD 6.1 million ($3.99 million) Wurrumiyanga Solar Infill and Energy Storage Pilot Project which is providing an upgrade for the community’s energy system which includes aging diesel infrastructure and dated solar technology.
The Northern Territory government said the updated off-grid power plant will displace some of Wurrumiyanga’s current diesel-generated power supply with renewables. It is expected that the percentage of renewable energy delivered to the community of about 2,000 will increase to almost 50%.
Northern Territory Renewables Minister Nicole Manison said the project is an important part of the government’s renewables targets and will help inform other clean energy projects in the Territory.
“This is an important step towards the Territory government achieving our target of 50% renewables by 2030, which includes an average of 70% renewables in communities supplied by Indigenous Essential Services,” she said.
“We look forward to extending the lessons learnt from this project to other remote Territory communities.”

When the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 was passed, one of the cornerstones of the $369 billion set aside for climate and energy spending is the Investment Tax Credit (ITC).
The U.S. Department of Treasury has released guidance on how to access the ITC. Find the full document here. 
The ITC sets aside a federal tax credit of 30% of installed system costs for clean energy technologies like solar, wind and energy storage. The credit is offered as a base 6%, and the 30% credit is only offered to projects that satisfy prevailing wage requirements.
A further 10% tax credit adder is offered to projects installed in eligible Energy Communities, which are defined by income status and the economic impact of legacy energy systems in their area.
Another 10% adder can be applied to projects that meet domestic content requirements. A large portion of the spending in the IRA is directed towards supporting the buildout of U.S.-based clean energy manufacturing, and the 10% domestic content adder is designed to stimulate demand for these products. The three credits can be combined to cover 50% of installed system costs.
Two other key facets of the ITC are direct pay and transferability. Direct pay is made available to tax-exempt entities investing in clean energy projects. Credits including the 30% Investment Tax Credit, plus any applicable adders, can be used by these entities as a payment against tax liability, and any remaining balance can be refunded as a direct payment to these entities. Tax years beginning January 1, 2023 are eligible for this transaction.
The November edition of pv magazine is dominated by the issue of global oversupply and examines the effects of a solar glut in the European Union, the United States, and other markets. We turn the spotlight on PV developments in South Korea, Taiwan, and Africa and update readers on technological progress in thin films, kerfless wafering, and mass produced heterojunction PV.
Organizations that are exempt from tax by § 501(a) are eligible for the direct pay option, as well as those described by § 501(c), including public charities, private foundations, social welfare organizations, labor organizations, business leagues, and others. The option is available to Tribal Governments, rural electric cooperative utilities, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, as well. A frequently asked questions page offers more information.
As for transferability, this process enables project owners to monetize tax credits by transferring them to other taxpayers. Under this transaction, renewable energy developers and owners are essentially able to sell tax credits for cash, making financing easier for new clean energy projects. The transferability option is generally open to the entities that are not covered by the direct pay option. More information in the frequently asked questions section can be found here.
pv magazine USA will continue to provide updates on the Section 48 guidance, which can be read in full here.

The VRV 5 systems are available in two models – the Mini-VRV system with an output of up to 33.5 kW and the Top-Blow series reaching 56 kW.
Both products use difluoromethane (R32) as the refrigerant and, according to the manufacturer, have a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 675. Daikin claims R-32 reduces potential direct CO2 equivalent emissions of the heating and cooling systems by up to 71% compared to heat pumps based on R-410A
The company also said its new VRV5 heat pumps have a 9.1% higher seasonal efficiency compared to its previous models. The new products also come with piping lengths of up to 1,000 m and have five low sound settings, down to 41 decibels.
“When VRV 5 is connected to Daikin's latest Daikin Cloud Plus platform, providing continuous real-time monitoring and energy management, the energy consumption of buildings can be further reduced,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “Daikin Cloud Plus also offers service technicians the advantage of performing equipment diagnostics and settings remotely.”
The new heat pump systems will be available for sale from February 2024.

Gila River Indian Community said it has signed an agreement with the US Army Corps of Engineers to install solar panels over irrigation canals on its land south of Phoenix, Arizona.
The first phase of the project will cover approximately 1,000 feet (304.8 meters) of canal, cutting down on water losses from evaporation. The project is expected to demonstrate the feasibility of solar-topped canals, potentially leading to additional miles of solar canals for the community in subsequent phases. The Army Corps is expected to complete the first phase of the project in 2025.
The cost of the first phase of the project is $6.744 million, adding 1 MW of solar capacity while reducing evaporation in the canal. The project is supported by a $517,000 grant from the Bureau of Reclamation. Funding for the second phase of the project is also expected to come from the Bureau of Reclamation, which is implementing a grant program established by Congress to pilot solar canals.
“This first pilot will break new ground and further the Community’s role as stewards of our shudag (water) and in keeping with the Community’s tradition of bringing innovation to irrigation systems throughout their lands,” said Gila River Indian Community governor Stephen Roe Lewis.
Earlier this year, a coalition of more tan 125 groups urged the US Interior Department and the Bureau of Reclamation to evaluate the efficacy of solar canals. The request, signed by many leading climate and environmental groups, highlighted the opportunity to cover 8,000 miles of open-air canals with solar capacity. An estimated 25 GW of renewable energy, enough to power nearly 20 million homes, could be installed on these locations, the group said.
“The Bureau of Reclamation and the states dependent on the Colorado River are already considering unprecedented water cuts to protect the water supplies for 40 million people who rely on the river,” said the letter. 
The solar canal project implemented by the Gila River community is among the first in the United States to break ground. It is expected to serve as an example for other regions challenged by water conservation and clean energy goals.
For example, California’s Central Valley Project, a large canal system, alone uses approximately 1 billion kWh of electricity annually to pump water. Bringing solar power closer to these systems would offer an efficient system for moving water, displacing the diesel generators used today.
“Given the Bureau of Reclamation’s long history of creating hydroelectric power, the generation of gigawatts of solar power on its canals would be a purely additive benefit, and could even help address shortfalls in electricity generation as when hydroelectric facilities are unable to operate due to low water levels,” said the letter.
Installing solar on canals is gaining popularity worldwide. Projects in California, India, Spain, and France are underway, with many packing in large utility-scale capacity.

Enphase Energy is expanding to the commercial-scale market with its new IQ8P-3P commercial microinverters. They are designed for small-scale commercial installations. 
The US-based microinverter specialist said that the microinverters support up to 480 W of peak output power, suitable for three-phase commercial installations and high-powered solar panels, accommodating a range of panel types from 320 W to 640 W.
Enphase said its distributed architecture makes designing commercial rooftop applications more seamless, enabling flexibility in design for maximizing yield on crowded or shaded small commercial rooftops. 
“We have been installing Enphase products for more than 13 years,” said Jason Szumlansky, owner of Florida Solar Design Group. “Enphase commercial microinverters are a game changer — simplifying installation, improving energy harvest, and satisfying client requirements. Our first project was successful and we found that commissioning a new Enphase commercial system is as simple as commissioning a residential installation.” 
The microinverters are backed by an industry leading 25-year warranty for projects in the United States and Canada and 12-year warranties for projects in Mexico. 
“If low-voltage power and module level rapid shutdown, production optimization, and monitoring are a priority for a project, then the new commercial IQ8 Microinverters are an excellent solution,” said Jason Jackson, co-founder and chief executive officer, Hakai Energy Solutions.
The commercial Enphase system includes the IQ Gateway Commercial 2, an internet-connected portal that enables over-the-air updates and the ability to connect to the Enphase App production monitoring platform. Enphase Kiosk Software is provided to display system performance in real-time, offering marketing, brand value, and sustainability-tracking by showcasing on-site clean energy generation. The new microinverters also feature Enphase Burst Mode technology, allowing panels to start earlier and turn off later in the day where other systems would stop generating power.
Enphase said the commercial microinverters are available for distributor orders today, with shipments expected to begin by the end of 2023. Shipments are expected to begin from Enphase’s US contract manufacturing facilities in the first quarter of 2024.
