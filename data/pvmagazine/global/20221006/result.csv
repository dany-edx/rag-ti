The approved projects will not need to go through additional environmental impact assessments. They include five wind projects ranging in size from 31.3 MW to 73.2 MW, spread across the southern regions of Apulia and Basilicata. They also include a 60 MW agrivoltaic project in Apulia, and two geothermal projects each with capacities of 5 MW in Toscana.
The Italian government began bypassing regional authorities to authorize some renewable energy projects in March, in response to a policy change for renewable energy permits. Since then, the Italian solar and renewable energy market has shown clear signs of recovery.
In March, the government also simplified the permitting process to install commercial rooftop PV systems with capacities between 50 kW and 200 kW. In Italy, such projects are allowed to operate under the country's net metering scheme, known as the “Scambio sul posto.”
Italy is expected to deploy around 5.1 GW of new renewables capacity this year, according to Minister of Economic Development Roberto Cingolani. He has said that around 0.64 GW of new renewable energy projects were connected to the grid in the first four months of the year and another 0.68 GW is set to be switched on soon in the country's high-voltage network, which is operated by Terna. In addition, another 3.8 GW of installations were recently approved and should go online by the end of this year.
The most recent statistics from ANIE Rinnovabili show that the country deployed more than 1 GW of PV in the first half of this year. According to these figures, PV projects below 1 MW in size represented almost all of the newly deployed capacity, at 686 MW. Solar parks above 1 MW in size accounted for 375 MW of the total.

Maxeon Solar Technologies has halted production at its solar module production facility in Porcelette, France.
The Porcelette plant, which Maxeon has owned since 2012, was recently upgraded to produce the company's Air rooftop modules. The light panels can be glued to commercial and industrial rooftops. The company had also received about €5 million ($4.9 million) of funding from the European Union and €400,000 of additional funding to relaunch the manufacturing facility. However, it decided not to participate in these subsidy programs.
“Due to the continued challenging pricing environment that has affected the solar PV industry, compounded by the recent increase in costs and import taxes on raw materials, the production costs of the factory does not make it competitive anymore on the European market,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “Hence the decision to continue to serve European customers through a manufacturing scheme that allows us to bring the best technology to the market at a competitive price.”
The factory was too small to globally compete, the company said. It was Maxeon's last production plant in Europe, as it closed another facility in Toulouse in 2021. From now on, the continent will be served via the group's other sites, notably in Mexico and Malaysia.
The group is also considering the possibility of expanding its production capacity in the United States. It said it will also retain its European headquarters and its main European warehouse in France, near Lyon.
“Maxeon continues to employ almost twice the number of people in France who worked at Porcelette,” said the spokesperson.
*The article was updated on October 11 to specify that Maxeon decided not to participate in the subsidy programs aimed at supporting the factory.

“Currently, we are working on a FlexTrail parallel print head allowing for fast, reliable, and precise processing of high-efficiency solar cells,” researcher Jörg Schube told pv magazine. “Because of the very low fluid consumption, we expect positive impacts on costs and ecological footprint for PV solutions.”
FlexTrail-printing can enable the precise application of media of different viscosities with an extremely precise, minimal structure width.
“It is demonstrated that it enables both an effective silver usage, contact uniformity, and low silver consumption,” the scientists said. “Due to its simplicity and process stability, it additionally has the potential for low cycle times per cell and is, thus, predestinated for a future lab-to-fab transfer.”
The technique involves the application of a very thin, flexible glass capillary filled with fluid at an atmospheric pressure of up to 11 bar. During the printing process, the capillary is in contact with the substrate and continuously trails over it.
“The glass capillary’s flexibility and bending allows for a non-destructive processing,” the academics said, noting that the method also enables the printing of curved structures. “Additionally, it balances possible substrate waviness.”
The research team fabricated one-cell modules using SmartWire Connection Technology (SWCT), which is a multi-wire interconnection technology based on copper wires covered with a low-temperature solder alloy.
“Typically, the wires are integrated into a polymer foil and attached to the solar cell by an automated stringing. The solder interconnection is formed during a subsequent lamination process conducted at a silicon heterojunction-compatible process temperature,” the researchers said.
They printed the fingers consecutively using one capillary, which resulted in silver-based functional lines with a feature size of 9 μm. They then built 22.8%-efficient SHJ solar cells on M2 wafers and with those cells they fabricated a 200 mm x 200 mm one-cell module.
The panel achieved a power conversion efficiency of 19.67%, an open-circuit voltage of 731.5 mV, a short-circuit current of 8.83 A, and a fill factor of 74.4%. For comparison, a reference module fabricated via screen printing achieved an efficiency of 20.78%, an open-circuit voltage of 733.5 mV, a short-circuit current of 8.91 A, and a fill factor of 77.7%.
“FlexTrail has an advantage over inkjet in terms of conversion efficiency. Moreover, it has an advantage in simpler and, therefore, more cost-effective processing, since only one pass per finger is necessary for printing and, in addition, silver consumption is lower,” the researchers said, adding that silver reduction was estimated at around 68%.
They presented their findings in “FlexTrail Printing as Direct Metallization with Low Silver Consumption for Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells: Evaluation of Solar Cell and Module Performance,” which was recently published in Energy Technology.
“To pave the way for an industrial application of FlexTrail printing, a parallel printhead is currently under development,” the scientists concluded. “For the near future, it is planned to utilize it not only for the metallization of SHJ but also for tandem solar cells, for example, perovskite silicon tandems.”

Germany's Creaton and building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) specialist Autarq have designed a new kind of solar tile.
The new “Creaton PV-Autarq” product is based on Creaton's Domino black tile, which is a smooth, flat brick that acts as a carrier for small monocrystalline PV elements supplied by Autarq. The tile features a 3.2 mm, hardened single pane of safety glass on the front side.
The panel has an operating temperature between -40 C to 85 C and can withstand mechanical stress levels of up to 5,400 pascals. Longevity and durability are certified according to IEC 61215 and safety according to IEC 61730. The components have a guarantee of up to 25 years.
“The Creaton PV-Autarq roof tile system has a modular structure and is therefore also perfectly suitable for complex roof areas,” said Creaton Sales Director Florian Scherr.
The solar roof tiles can be installed in combination with original tiles. The size of the PV area can be designed flexibly. The tiles are individually connected to one another by plug-in connections when they are deployed. All connection cables and plug contacts remain hidden under the bricks and are protected from the weather.

France's National Solar Energy Institute (INES) – a division of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) – has teamed up with Italian solar module manufacturer Enel Green Power to jointly develop DC/DC maximum power point trackers (MPPT). The two partners are also now working on high-efficiency bifacial PV panels.
“However, this technology, intended among other things for applications in large ground-based power plants, can still improve energy efficiency and not only thanks to cell and module yields,” INES said in a press release. “The addition of an energy conversion system, as close as possible to the panel, makes it possible to reduce the impact of certain faults linked to the installation site, and to increase the overall power of the plant.”
Enel Green Power and INES have developed a DC/DC MPPT solution with a maximum power of 500 W at the module level. This makes it possible to increase the number of panels in a row in order to increase the overall power, while limiting the output voltage to remain in the low voltage range of less than 1,500 V DC.
They said 36 prototype DC/DC MPPT converters were installed at a CEA demonstrator site in Cadarache, France, to conduct tests in real operating conditions. The demonstration unit is equipped with a specific monitoring tool that transmits voltage and current data at the input and output of the converter, as well as overall production data.
The demonstrator has been in operation since July 2021. It has made it possible to observe the proper functioning of the converters. The companies compared the energy produced by the solar plant equipped with the solution to the energy produced by a conventional power plant equipped with a conventional inverter. The results showed that the solution could contribute to energy production gains of 1%.
The deployment of the solution on a very large power plant on a 1 MW scale is planned in Catania, Italy. It will make it possible to test a pre-industrial version and refine the technical and economic gains made.

South Australia’s first solar-powered cryptocurrency-mining facility, which uses renewable energy sourced from a solar project, is now up and running in the town of Whyalla, on the east coast of the Eyre Peninsula.
Developed by the South Australia-based Lumos Digital Mining, the 5 MW data center will be used to mine bitcoin, which requires energy-hungry computers to solve complex maths equations for financial rewards. Lumos CEO Dong Wang said that the facility is powered by renewable energy sourced from the 5 MW Tregalana solar project, which was co-developed by Melbourne-based Climate Capital and South Australia-headquartered renewables developer Eyre Power. The cryptocurrency-mining operation uses 100% of the energy generated by the behind-the-meter Tregalana project, with any remaining power requirements to be met through the grid.
Cryptocurrency production has attracted widespread criticism for the amount of energy it uses, but Wang said the operation provides the developers of the Tregalana Solar Project with a guaranteed baseload, ensuring that the project is financially viable. Wang said output could also be ramped up to use surplus energy from different sources when electricity generation exceeds demand, which could provide a solution for renewable energy developers who are dealing with curtailment issues.
“Renewable energy projects are already not being allowed to connect to the grid due to curtailment and others are suffering heavy losses when they switch off at times of low consumption,” he said. “We keep using the power 24/7 and that’s a huge benefit to the renewables developers, it makes their projects more financially viable. We are basically like a sponge. We soak up the excess that’s not used.”
 
 
 
Wang said cryptocurrency production can also eliminate the need for developers to deploy battery energy storage systems to absorb excess generation, describing the mining operation as “digital storage”.
“Because we are a mining farm we don’t need storage,” he said. “Crypto mining offers a way better and cheaper solution than battery storage. Battery power is only released one or two times a day. Digital mining is a 24/7 business, and this is not just for mining cryptocurrency. We can provide a cloud service, we can provide a computing service for Google, for Apple, for any of the large server companies.”
Wang said the company has already been talking with other energy generation project developers about retrofitting crypto mining facilities to help them overcome curtailment issues.
“We are hoping to sign up more PPAs to assist more renewable projects in the future,” he said. “We are in discussions with some larger developers. If they can retrofit our mining facilities, then we can free up their generation. This represents how we transform the negative NEM price into digital storage and assets.”
The Whyalla operation has the potential to mine at least 100 bitcoins in a year, but Lumos intends to increase the size of the mining facility, with construction of a 10 MW solar farm expected to commence in “a couple of months.” Wang said the facility would be built beside the existing 5 MW Whaylla solar farm which was developed by Lumos’ sister company, Southern Sustainable Electric (SSE).
The output of the Whaylla solar farm, which was commissioned in 2018, is sold on a merchant basis by Melbourne-based SSE. However, the planned 10 MW facility would be used to power an expansion of the cryptocurrency-mining operation.
“We aim to build the most prominent renewable digital mining business in Australia by utilising thriving sustainable energy resources,” Wang said.

Rivian electric trucks fresh off the production line will source their first charge from renewable energy, as the company has installed a solar charging yard at its factory in Normal, Illinois.
The charging yard is a series of parking canopies topped with solar panels, with a total capacity of 783 kW. The DC charging facility can charge 72 vehicles at once. Rivian said it is also working on installing a 2.8 MW wind turbine for charging. The project is expected to generate 1.04 million kWh per year. It went online in September, charging R1 vehicles before they are delivered to customers.
ForeFront Power developed the project. The company has also developed solar for LaGuardia Airport, Sonoma County Transportation, and Michigan based cidery Virtue Cider.
“Rivian’s Solar Charging Yard project is a testament to the company’s climate and sustainability leadership, showing U.S. customers what a clean energy future looks like within the auto industry,” said Michael Smith, CEO of ForeFront Power.
Rivian signed the Climate Pledge to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, 10 years before the Paris Agreement goals.
Rivian’s R1T truck has 260 miles (418 km) to 400 miles of range on a full charge, can go from 0 miles to 60 miles per hour in three seconds, with a towing capacity of up to 11,000 pounds (4,990 km). The all-wheel drive vehicle comes in dual or quad motors and sits on a 21-inch wheel.
Rivian’s standard warranty is five years, or 60,000 miles. The battery pack and drivetrain are covered for eight years or 175,000 miles, and its limited corrosion warranty is eight years with unlimited miles.

The founders of Aptera, Chris Anthony and Steve Fambro, helped to create the electric vehicle market in 2006 with a solar-powered EV, and it got a lot of attention. But the world wasn’t ready for a solar vehicle and funding didn’t exist like it does today.
Fast forward 13 years to 2019, and the two returned to designing an EV focused solely on efficiency. Today’s Aptera is equipped with almost 700 W of integrated solar cells, which enables it to drive up to 40 miles per day on the sun’s rays alone. The car’s battery is designed for a 1,000-mile range.

Aptera is working with Maxeon Solar Technologies as the cell supplier for its solar production program, and the carmaker’s solar engineers have used the cells to create ultra-lightweight, curved solar panels. Aptera selected Maxeon Gen 3 solar cells because they are durable, lightweight and have minimal energy loss.
“We’re pleased to have been selected by Aptera to bring this next phase of solar innovation to market. At Maxeon, we provide the highest quality and most efficient solar technology, and Aptera’s mission to pioneer solar mobility is the natural progression of this innovation,” said Mark Babcock, interim CEO and chief revenue officer at Maxeon Solar Technologies. “The vehicle will feature the same extraordinary cells as those found in our high-efficiency solar panels powering homes and businesses – a true testament to our innovation as a solar leader.”
In June, Aptera said it chose EVE Energy as its supplier of lithium-ion battery cells. It also said it planned to use Eve’s 21700 NMC 811 cylindrical cells in its vehicle’s structural battery packs.
Apterra said it currently has more than 25,000 reservations from customers in more than 100 countries. Prices range from $25,900 to $50,700.

The Oslo-based commercial and industrial (C&I) solar-leasing business raised $74 million from equity investors last week in a deal announced at the Africa Renewables Investment Summit in Cape Town, South Africa, according to a report published by the Africa Solar Industry Association (AFSIA). The AFSIA article said that Empower New Energy will top up the equity fundraising with loans to expand its operations.
Empower New Energy bundles solar projects across Africa to reduce risk before selling them on further down the line. The developer installs and maintains solar and batteries for business clients who benefit from lower electricity prices.
Climate Fund Managers (CFM), which led the equity investment in Empower is a joint venture between Dutch development lender the FMO (Nederlandse Financierings-Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden) and the Sanlam Infraworks unit of South Africa's Sanlam Group.
Empower New Energy has installed 5.5 MW of solar capacity for African C&I clients across eight projects in Egypt, Ghana, and Nigeria since its first, $7.9 million funding round in 2019. Its initial investors were EU energy access body Edfi Electrifi, Norfund, and a dozen private investors. The company has also reportedly signed contracts for a $30 million, 150 MW development pipeline of projects in Egypt, Morocco, Ghana, and Nigeria.
Empower  New Energy's investment platform was developed with the help of the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation and the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa which is managed by the African Development Bank and financed by the governments of Denmark, Italy, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
