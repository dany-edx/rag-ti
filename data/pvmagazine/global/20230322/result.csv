It was a year of record growth, largely based on newly installed PV systems, according to IRENA.
The organization says 191 GW of solar was installed last year. It notes that growth is still largely concentrated in a handful of countries and regions such as Asia, the United States, and Europe. Asia accounted for 60% of new capacity additions, where 1.63 TW of renewables are now installed.
China accounted for almost half of the new global renewables capacity in 2022, at 141 GW. A total of 57.3 GW were added in Europe in 2022 and 29.1 GW in North America, according to IRENA. Africa continued its steady growth at 2.7 GW, slightly above the figures for the previous year.
“This sustained record growth demonstrates the resilience of renewable energy amid the current energy crisis,” said IRENA Director General Francesco La Camera.
IRENA says hydropower still accounts for the largest share of installed renewables capacity at 1,255 GW. But last year, only 21 GW were added. Solar is catching up and last year passed the terawatt milestone of installed capacity.
IRENA has listed the top 10 global PV markets in terms of cumulative installed capacity:

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/22/saudi-arabias-solar-market/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,MIDDLE EAST,SAUDI ARABIA",,"MARCH 22, 2023",Saudi Arabia’s solar market,"The Saudi Arabian government has taken significant steps in recent years to address the challenges and encourage the development of renewable energy projects. These efforts include the establishment of the Saudi Renewable Energy Project Development Office to oversee the development of renewable energy projects and the launch of the Solar Energy Plan, which aims to install 27.5 GW of solar capacity by 2030. Additionally, the Kingdom plans to launch the greenhouse gas certificates market in 2023 as part of its efforts to reduce carbon emissions.
Saudi Arabia is expected to add 10 GW of renewable capacity between 2022 and 2027, with solar PV leading the way. This growth will be driven by four procurement mechanisms: competitive auctions, unsolicited bilateral utility contracts, corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs), and state-owned projects. The forecast for this growth has been revised upward from previous estimates due to progress made under all four business models and the announced climate commitments during COP27.
For competitive auctions, PPAs have been signed for half of the projects in the third round, and the fourth round opened in September 2022, with higher-than-expected volumes on offer. The country's first corporate PPA project was commissioned in 2021 after the implementation of a new Private Sector Participation Law that allows developers to sell directly to consumers. This regulatory change Is expected to facilitate the growth of future corporate PPA projects.
Additionally, the government has announced plans to develop another 2.3 GW of renewable capacity through bilateral contracts under the Public Investment Fund and build state-owned projects in industrial cities. However, the pace of auctions for onshore wind remains to be determined, as it took four years to commission the Round 1 projects, and the capacity earmarked for wind in the third round is yet to be awarded.
The total generating capacity of the National Renewable Energy Program projects in the kingdom is expected to reach approximately 56 million megawatt-hours, with clean electricity generation. capacity increasing to around 58.7 GW by 2030. Of this, 40 GW will come from solar energy, 16 GW from wind energy, and 2.7 GW from other renewables.
Saudi Arabia is actively working to increase the use of renewable energy as part of its goal to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2060. Although there may be challenges in the future, such as competition with fossil fuels and the pace of the adoption of net billing system by consumers, the government has taken steps to improve legislation and increase the self-consumption limit to include large capacities over 2 MW in order to boost the distributed generation (DG) market. The utility-scale market in Saudi Arabia is currently one of the most important in the Middle East and North Africa region, with annual additions of approximately 1-15 GW. Overall, Saudi Arabia is making progress in increasing the use of renewable energy and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
16 projects are in the plans for the kingdom including the launch of five Energy Projects Totalling 3,300 MW including two solar projects (1,500 MW), distributed in Al Hanakiya – 1,100 MW and Tabarjal – 400 MW. The kingdom, by leveraging its unique geographical and climatic characteristics, is creating an environment economically favorable for renewable energy sources have become economically attractive. By diversifying the country's energy mix, KSA’s renewable market is becoming more competitive and achieving the world's lowest prices for renewable energy projects.
This extract from MESIA’s Solar Outlook report gives an At a Glance View of Saudi’s recent progress and its pipeline. MESIA together with Solarabic will further explore the strategy of the kingdom, its projects and policies in an upcoming event to be held in Riyad on May 23d&24th.

“The technology is based on high-quality energy-efficient core components, but can be used in a modular way,” Germany-based solar Phaesun said in a statement. “Different systems can be configured and built using the same core components and other construction materials [available locally] such as piping, insulation, and pumps: from small refrigerators to large milk cooling tanks and cooling containers.”
The companies have installed 25 cooling systems in six African countries. A SelfChill system with a 20 m3 volume was installed in a basil and mint farm in the Kenyan village of Thika in 2021. Farmers store the crops in the cold room at a temperature of 4 C until the produce is picked up for sale.
“The SelfChill cooling units consist of DC-powered vapor compression heat pumps that generate the cold,” Geraldine Quelle, project manager at Phaesun, told pv magazine, adding that the heat pumps have a COP of 2 and are powered by a 2.8 kW solar array. “The cold is then stored in a water bath (thermal storage), and moved via a water-air heat exchanger.”
The system took part in the Off-Grid Cold Chain Challenge by the Global Leap Initiative, where the technical performance of 12 cold rooms installed in the tropics and subtropics was field-tested over a period of six months. It reportedly showed the best and most reliable performance in the competition and was named “Top Winner of the Global Leap Award.”
“The cold room in Thika has been in continuous use for 18 months and is bringing enormous benefits to the local farmers,” Phaesun engineer Florian Martini said. “Previously, they had large post-harvest losses because onward transport of the herbs was often delayed, and parts of the harvest spoiled. Now they store the harvest in the cold room for up to four days before collection.”
The Global Leap Initiative, sponsored among others by the World Bank and the IKEA Foundation, aims to encourage market transformation toward the best, most-efficient off-grid energy service technologies through its Awards programs.

Green Akku, a German supplier of solar modules for application on balconies, has developed a residential battery designed for balcony PV modules. It says that the new lithium iron phosphate battery will allow homeowners to self-consume all of the power generated by their balcony solar panels, without having to feed it into the grid.
Green Akku offers two separate “selfPV” complete packages, with either one or two 380 W solar modules. The kit includes a 24 V/100 Ah battery with a storage capacity of 2.56 kWh, a module inverter, a solar controller, and other accessories such as cables and solar plugs.
System owners can also use a smart controller to determine whether the battery stores the electricity or feeds it into the home network. Programming and power consumption can be adjusted depending on the weather and season.
Green Akku said the selfPV kits are more expensive than larger rooftop systems.
“With a self-consumption of around 640 kWh of solar power per year, the kits would still pay for themselves after five to 10 years for the end customer,” the company said.

The company did not provide specific figures, but it said that different entities from Europe, Australia, the United States, and the Middle East have expressed interest in certification.
“Many operators see the independent certification as a means to demonstrate to respective regulators about the carbon footprints of their green hydrogen generation supporting the claims for the government incentives for producing green hydrogen and also to gain bankability of their projects with investors,” Rajiv Sabharwal, vice president of business development and energy for Bureau Veritas North America, told pv magazine.
The French company will assess renewable hydrogen production assets against environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, while also considering safety processes and greenhouse gas emissions.
“It will also assess the renewable energy that is used to power the electrolyzer,” Sabharwal added. “The scheme's biggest differentiator is its assessment of safety in addition to the life cycle assessment of the carbon footprints of green hydrogen, which aims to facilitate the global trade of hydrogen with a consistent definition of renewable hydrogen.”
He said that North America will be a major hub for the generation, consumption, and export of clean hydrogen, due to the incentive schemes in place in the United States. He added that midstream infrastructure and electrolyzers will require significant investments.
“The industry will be challenged by a lack of harmonized regulations, supply chain issues, and availability of trained manpower,” said Sabharwal. “It will need extensive investment to overcome this issue in the next 10 years.”
Bureau Veritas said that the final step in its scheme will be to issue labels after verifying the amount of hydrogen produced by certified assets.
“The label stipulates that the asset must have a carbon footprint below 2 kg CO2 equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen,” the company said. “Quarterly verification of the hydrogen output and the renewable electricity input will be required to maintain the label.”

“Green” hydrogen is the production of hydrogen fuels using emissions free generations sources like solar and wind energy. While renewables-charged battery-powered vehicles and power plants are expected to make up a large share of the energy transition, green hydrogen has garnered interest for heavy trucking and industrial use cases due it its ability to dispatch high amounts of power. 
Production of green hydrogen typically takes the “indirect” approach using solar and wind to power electrolyzers. These renewables-powered electrolyzers have reached round-trip efficiencies of around 30%. 
A research team at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) Institute for Solar Fuels is investigating another pathway to emissions-free hydrogen production through a process they call the “direct” approach. The approach is outlined in a recent Nature Communications article. 
The team is developing photoelectrodes that convert sunlight into electrical energy, are stable in aqueous solutions, and catalytically split water into hydrogen. The photoelectrodes are coupled with catalyst materials, creating the active component in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell. 
Today, the best PEC cells are able to achieve efficiencies near 10% and are made of low-cost and relatively stable metal oxide absorbers. Though they are significantly less efficient than their indirect green hydrogen counterparts, PEC cells have some advantages. The heat from the direct sunlight can be used to further accelerate reactions. And, since the densities range ten to 100 times lower with this approach, more abundant and inexpensive materials can be used as catalysts, said the researchers. 
Despite these promising elements of the PEC approach, techno-economic analysis and net energy analysis have shown that it is not yet competitive with the conventional green hydrogen production approach. Hydrogen fuel from PEC systems costs about $10 per kg, about six times more than “blue” hydrogen from fossil methane steam reforming at $1.50 per kg. Also, cumulative energy demand for PEC water splitting is estimated to be four to 20 times higher than for hydrogen production with renewable energy and electrolyzers. 
Despite this gulf in cost efficacy between the approaches, the research team at HZB Institute is testing other potential benefits of PEC. The group tested the effects of how the hydrogen produced reacts further with itaconic acid in the same reactor to form methyl succinic acid (MSA). MSA is another chemical fuel that can be used to dispatch high amounts of energy like hydrogen. 
The PEC technology enables MSA to be produced at only one-seventh of the typical energy requirement of MSA fuel production processes. 
To find this, researchers calculated how much energy is needed to produce the PEC cell from light absorbers, catalyst materials and other materials such as glass, and how long the system must function to produce this energy in the form of chemical energy as hydrogen or MSA. 
For hydrogen alone, the energy payback period is about 17 years when assuming a modest 5% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. If only 2% of the hydrogen produced is used to convert itatonic acid into MSA, the energy payback time is halved. If 30% of the hydrogen is converted into MSA, the production energy can be regained after just 2 years. 
“This makes the process much more sustainable and competitive,” said Dr Fatwa Abdi, HZB Institute for Solar Fuels. “This approach offers a way to significantly reduce the production cost of green hydrogen and increases the economic feasibility of PEC technology. We have carefully thought through the process, and the next step is to test in the laboratory how well the simultaneous production of hydrogen and MSA works in practice.”

Renewables developer Skylab says the proposed Punch’s Creek Renewable Energy Project – to be built near Toowoomba, Queensland – will include an 800 MW solar farm and a 250 MW/250 MWh battery energy storage system.
In a development application lodged with the Toowoomba Regional Council, Brisbane-based Skylab said the plan is for the project to be developed in two stages. The first phase of construction will involve the installation of 400 MW of solar, along with the big battery and associated infrastructure, including a substation.
Construction of the initial phase is scheduled to begin in the middle of 2024 and will take about 18 months. The second stage of the project will add a further 400 MW of solar.
Skylab said the project will support state and national renewable energy targets and provide essential support as coal-fired generation capacity continues to exit the system.
“With direct access to the Powerlink transmission network this site provides the ultimate balance between connection and opportunity,” the company said. “With recent decisions to phase out coal generation plants, this project is in the optimum location to replace 900 MW of adjacent generation.”
The project is being built near the 825 MW coal-fired Millmerran Power Station, which is currently scheduled to close in 2051. It will connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via Powerlink’s existing 330 kV electricity transmission line.
“Being located proximate to the Millmerran Power Station, the solar and energy storage facility will be able to maximise its access to the grid and its ability to export renewable energy into the power system,” Skylab said in its application.
Skylab is also progressing plans for the 94 MW Gunsynd Solar Farm near Goondiwindi in southwestern Queensland. The company said it has secured a connection agreement for the project, which will also include 20 MW of energy storage capacity, and construction is expected to commence in the second quarter of this year.
The company’s portfolio also includes the Springvale Renewable Project near Townsville in north Queensland. The proposal includes a 400 MW solar farm with 100 MWh of battery energy storage and green hydrogen production capacity.
