SunPower has announced an expansion to its residential battery storage system, SunVault Storage, in the form of 26 kWh and 52 kWh configurations, allowing the system to provide customers with backup power for every device in their homes in the event of an outage.
According to SunPower, the reasons behind the launch were twofold. According to the company’s 2021 Energy Sense Index, 40% of homeowners worry about outages every month. For customers in natural disaster-prone regions or California customers living in areas subject to frequent blackouts, these concerns often become reality, for a few hours or even days at a time. The company also cites EIA data outlining that the length of time an average American goes without electricity has doubled between 2013 and 2020.
“As power disruptions are becoming more commonplace, the demand for energy resilience and reliability is higher than ever,” said Nate Coleman, chief products officer at SunPower. “With the new SunVault, we are going beyond just the essentials. Customers can have the peace of mind that even if their grid service is disrupted, their lives don’t have to be.”
Under both battery configurations, the SunVault system can keep indispensable appliances running, like refrigeration and HVAC, while also allowing customers to keep power to non-essential, comfort appliances, like a pool pump, EV charger, or really anything in the home that runs on electricity.
Alongside the launch of the new battery configurations, SunPower also announced a new warranty for SunVault systems. All SunVault energy storage systems will come backed by a 10-year warranty, including 70% usable energy retention.
According to SunPower, installations of the new SunVault will begin in June 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/28/the-sun-is-still-shining-on-poly-makers-but-solar-developers-struggling-in-china/,"COVID-19,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",MAX HALL,"MARCH 28, 2022",The sun is still shining on poly makers but solar developers struggling in China,"With the annual reporting season under way in Hong Kong, the first numbers published for 2021 have illustrated the contrasting fortunes afflicting Chinese companies in the global solar supply chain.
Polysilicon maker and renewables developer Xinte Energy has published annual figures illustrating why it is trying to ramp its annual poly production capacity from 66,000 tons – at the end of December – to 400,000.
The business on Friday said solar panel raw material polysilicon had contributed RMB11.6 billion (US$1.82 billion) to its total revenue of RMB22.5 billion (US$3.53 billion) last year, thanks to rising prices, even if more costly silicon powder, tricholorosilane gas, and electricity added RMB1.07 billion (US$168 million) to its annual bill.
The poly operation generated RMB5.11 billion (US$803 million) of net profit for the TBEA-owned business last year, more than the final, RMB4.96 billion (US$779 million) total net-profit-for-shareholders number reported by Xinte, after costs higher up the company were removed. Xinte posted total net profits to the owners of just RMB635 million (US$99.7 million) from 2020.
The manufacturer said its Xinjiang operation – which is liable to be affected by the US’ import ban – is set to be upgraded to 100,000 tons of annual capacity by the end of June and it expects poly production from its new, RMB8.8 billion (US$1.38 billion), 100,000-ton Inner Mongolia fab this year.
The company is planning a further, RMB17.6 billion, 200,000-ton facility in Zhundong, with half the cost to be funded by a shares issue announced this month.
Xinte said it produced 78,200 tons of poly last year and hopes to churn out 110-120,000 tons this year, as well as developing 2-2.5GW of solar and wind project generation capacity and having 2.5-3GW of such facilities under management.
The clean energy project development business generated revenue and net profits of RMB9.73 billion (US$1.53 billion) and RMB 286 million (US$44.9 million), respectively, last year, Xinte said. Its renewable project management operation posted respective figures of RMB1.87 billion (US$294 million) and RMB796 million (US$125 million).
By contrast, state-owned solar developer China Shuifa Singyes Energy Holdings published annual results showing it turned away from solar in favor of wind projects last year, because of rising PV system costs.
The development of solar projects generated revenue of RMB357 million (US$56 million) last year, compared to RMB1.19 billion (US$187 million) in 2020, and generated a gross profit of just RMB8.2 million (US$1.29 million), Shuifa Singyes reported on Thursday. Wind project development, however, generated RMB3.08 billion (US$484 million) of the company’s total 2021 revenue of RMB6.5 billion (US$1.02 billion).
While total revenue rose, profit for shareholders fell from RMB311 million (US$48.8 million), in 2020, to RMB221 million (US$34.7 million) thanks to a one-off gain of RMB209 million (US$32.8 million) in the earlier year from the repurchase of senior notes.
Shuifa Singyes’ end-of-year cash balance fell from RMB903 million (US$142 million) to RMB659 million (US$103 million) and the developer has RMB6.13 billion (US$963 million) of liabilities due within a year, including RMB1.55 billion ($243 million) worth of notes, and RMB824 million (US$129 million) of borrowings.
The company, which is recommending a dividend of HK$0.02 (US$0.003) per share, said it had a solar project portfolio of 589MW of generation capacity at the end of December, plus 43MW awaiting grid connection.
Fellow developer Shunfeng International Clean Energy has already said it will be unable to publish its 2021 figures by Thursday's deadline, because of China's Covid-19 outbreak, but has warned shareholders it anticipates the RMB502 million (US$78.8 million) loss it posted in 2020 will have risen to RMB750 million (US$118 million) once the accountants have crunched last year's numbers.
Shunfeng said that was down to it having lost RMB375 million on the book value of PV projects it sold last year, compared to a RMB332 million (US$52.1 million) reverse a year earlier, plus the fact last year did not see it book revenues from any such sale-listed projects, unlike it had in 2020.
The earlier year’s figures had also been buffed when RMB123 million (US$19.3 million) of engineering, procurement and construction fees owed by Shunfeng was waived, the developer said on Friday, adding it had benefited from no such creditor generosity last year.
The company added, the losses were partly offset by the fact the hit it took on finance costs fell last year, to RMB593 million (US$93.1 million), from a RMB777 million (US$122 million) reverse a year earlier.

Spanish power provider Endesa, a subsidiary of Italy-based utility Enel, has announced it has won Pego's fair transition competition in Portugal for the construction of a project that combines the hybridization of renewable sources and their storage with initiatives of social and economic development.
Through the international contest, the Italian-owned Spanish company's Portuguese subsidiary, Endesa Generación Portugal, secured a connection permit to link to the 224 MegavoltAmpere (MPA) network to install a hybrid facility integrating PV, wind power, battery storage and a small hydrogen generation unit in Pego, in the Santarém district of central Portugal.
According to Endesa, the project will require an investment of approximately €600 million and will consist of a 365MW PV unit, a 264MW wind farm, and 168MW of battery storage. The utility did not indicate what storage capacity the battery facility would have. It will also be connected to a 500kW electrolyzer that will be used with surplus power that cannot be stored by the batteries.
The project is claimed to allow about 6,000 hours of annual production, which the company said is higher than the operation of any conventional thermal plant.
The hybrid renewable energy plant is replacing a 628MW coal power plant located in Pego, which should be closed by Endesa this year. Workers of the old facility will be integrated in the operation of the new plant, Endesa said.
“It will also include activities of the primary sector such as agriculture, livestock, or beekeeping between the solar panels,” Endesa's statement reads.

The second Solar Power in Africa webinar, organized by analyst REGlobal, heard from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development‘s Gabriel de Lastours that few commercial lenders in Africa are prepared to offer the 25-year credit arrangements required by clean power developers.
The latest edition of pv magazine investigates the rapid rise of TOPCon cell manufacturing. While not the only option PV manufacturers have their eye on, TOPCon is already the first n-type cell to claim significant market share. We chart the tech’s progress from laboratory to gigawatt production, plus efforts to standardize process flows, reduce costs, and raise performance.
But Wale Shonibare, director for energy financial solutions, policy, and regulation at the AFDB, said the development financier has introduced the Nigerian infrastructure network to offer finance in local currency. The product helps attract different types of investor, depending upon the form of the local solar value chain, Shonibare told last week's event.
Staying in Nigeria, Anita Otubu, head of the program management unit for government initiative the Nigeria Electrification Project, gave details of a drive by Abuja to provide off-grid renewable electricity, backed by a $350 million loan from the World Bank and $200 million in credit from the AFDB.
Otubu said the government wants to provide clean power to 705,000 households, 90,000 micro-to-medium sized businesses, 400 health centers, 100 Covid-19 treatment and isolation centers, 15 federal colleges, and two teaching hospitals. The off-grid program also aims to provide 24,500 appliances to meet mini-grid load demand. The initiative, Otubu said, would provide an NGN140 billion ($336 million) credit facility to fund 5 million new solar connections to help 25 million people.
The online webinar was supported by New Delhi-based electricity trade website Global Transmission Report and compatriot publication Renewable Watch, and sponsored by Chinese manufacturer Trina Solar.

Toulouse-based start-up Freecold has developed a PV-powered, battery-free mini tank for the storage of milk, juice, beverages, or food products.
The device has been designed for the needs of small producers, which do not need large storage tanks. The kit is made up of a mini-tank with a cold reserve and three photovoltaic modules which make it possible to reach four degrees Celsius in three hours with an outside temperature of 30 degrees. The cold reserve is isolated in order to limit heat loss during the night and to preserve the freshness accumulated during the day via a refrigeration unit with a power output of 450W which is directly powered by solar energy.
“The outer body of the double-walled tank is rotomolded in an unbreakable, impact-resistant plastic and injected with polyurethane foam to limit heat losses,” the manufacturer said. “Placed between the tank and the outer body, the evaporator is embedded in the patented Freecold Ecocontainer's gel, to ensure, without batteries, cooling of the evening milking and quality of the cold during the night.”
The solar panels can be fixed with a mounting structure delivered with the kit and are designed for use in commercially available carports or shades. The refrigeration unit is placed under the tank and perforated side covers allow the heat to escape from the refrigeration unit and prevent small animal and rodent intrusion.
The device is currently competing in the 2022 Intersolar Awards innovation competition. Freecold develops and manufactures its direct solar cooling solutions in France where it also sells solar refrigerators and programmable refrigerators and freezers as well as hybrid or 100% solar air conditioning systems.

A team of researchers from The University of Queensland (UQ) has designed an atomic-thin cathode material that reduces corrosion in lithium-ion batteries and has demonstrated improved high-voltage cycling stability with capacity retention of almost 80% after 1,000 cycles.
Prof. Lianzhou Wang said he and his team from the School of Chemical Engineering and Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) have demonstrated a rechargeable lithium-ion battery which remains stable for more than 1,000 cycles.
“We’ve designed a uniquely-grown atomic-thin functional layer on the surface of a high-voltage cathode, which is the source of lithium ions and a critical aspect that limits the cycle life in a battery,” he said. “This new approach features a minimal protective coating at a scalable process, paving the way for the deployment of these abundant high-voltage materials for next generation high energy batteries.”
Wang said corrosion in one form or another is the primary reason that batteries degrade but the new process would increase the life-span of batteries in everything from smart phones to electric vehicles (EVs).
The new technology involves the application of an epitaxially-engineered wetting layer on a lithium nickel manganese oxide (LNMO) cathode material. The research team said the atomic-thin wetting layer offers long-term suppression of the transition metal dissolution from the cathode without impacting its dynamics.
Wang said when tested in full lithium-ion coin cell configuration the coated LNMO, in combination with a graphite anode and a non-aqueous electrolyte solution, enables a capacity retention of about 77% after 1,000 cycles at 290mAg−1 and a final discharge capacity of about 80mAhg−1 with an average coulombic efficiency (CE) >99%.
Wang said with industry under increasing pressure to decarbonise, the development of lithium-ion batteries of lower cost, higher energy density and longer cycle life is vitally important.
“We’re confident the nanotechnology will have widespread applications across industry, including in consumer electronics, electric vehicles and the energy storage sector,” he said.
Dr Rosalind Gummow, technical specialist with Brisbane-based company VSPC, which is focused on developing and commercialising advanced cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, welcomed the development.
“New methods like the use of epitaxial surface layers to improve the cycling efficiency and cycle life of high-voltage cathodes are vital in the quest to improve the energy density of Li-ion batteries,” she said. “The methods developed here also have potential to stabilise other cathode materials that degrade rapidly with cycling.”
The scientists explained their findings in “Epitaxial growth of an atom-thin layer on a LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode for stable Li-ion battery cycling,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/28/quantifying-loss-mitigating-effects-of-pv-warranty-insurance/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY,WEBINAR PARTNER MUNICH RE,WEBINAR PARTNER VDE RENEWABLES,WEBINAR PARTNER MUNICH RE,WEBINAR PARTNER VDE RENEWABLES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 28, 2022",Quantifying loss-mitigating effects of PV warranty insurance,"German consultancy VDE Renewables and global reinsurer Munich Re have recently entered into a strategic partnership to offer long-term performance guarantees with tailored insurance solutions to the owners of large scale PV assets.
In a whitepaper, the two companies have outlined their approach, that is claimed to help quantify the impact of risk mitigation measures applied to PV projects, as well as the advantages that may derive by relying on an insurance solution.
The proposed approach is based on the cost priority number (CPN) method, which consists of a cost-based failure mode effect analysis developed in the frame of the Solar Bankability Project. “The CPN methodology allows accurate economic quantification of PV degradation modes and other performance-degrading impacts of PV plant operation,” Ulrike Jahn, R&D project manager at VDE Renewables, told pv magazine. “The CPN method allows an estimation of the economic impact of failures on PV project business models and was developed not only to determine the economic impact of technical risks but also to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures.”
The two companies said that the risk quantification methodology was recently applied to a case study on a 10MW PV power plant that was seriously affected by potential induced degradation (PID). Their experts found that after four years of operations, the solar park had suffered a loss of around 25% of its expected power yield. “Taking into account the real investment (capex) and operating costs (opex), as well as the annual revenue (PPA), the 20-year financial revenue projection results in a loss of 45% of the rated power if no mitigation measures are taken,” they further explained.
Through their analysis, the companies' experts also found that a PV warranty insurance would have helped to significantly reduce these financial losses by enabling the application of two mitigating measures: installing PID boxes to reverse the power losses, and replacing the defective modules. “Taking into account the additional costs of the two mitigation measures, of €3.233 million, the cumulative financial revenues result in a deviation from expected revenues of only -5% for the first and second measure, for the 20-year financial perspective.” the whitepaper reads.
“What the warranty insurance generally safeguards is a stable performance of solar assets, as it insures non-physical damage of PV modules,” Jahn further explained, adding such damage could be “due to various perils in a very wide range.” She continued: “These can include under-performance of PV modules due to polymer degradation of the backsheet and the encapsulant; light-elevated, temperature-induced degradation (LeTID) and light-induced degradation (LID) for n-type modules; and rear PID for PERC cells.”
According to her, damages may also arise in hot cells in partly shaded high-power PV modules, shaded tandem perovskite/silicon cells, and heterojunction devices. “Cell cracks of half-cut cells and other degradation modes of current and new-module technologies must also be considered,” she added, noting that insurance cannot and should not replace the project developer’s due diligence and duties of care. “Especially with the insurance,” she said, “regular monitoring, inspection, and testing of the PV modules during the operational phase remains a basic requirement.”
According to Julia Moser, responsible for PV warranty insurance at Munich Re’s Green Tech Solution, PV warranty insurance may partially or completely cover the costs for the required mitigation measures if the solar modules are warranty-insured by the manufacturer. Furthermore, she also noted that all stakeholders should understand that, in the proposed methodology, the PV warranty insurance should be considered as an effective early detection mechanism for potential warranty claims.
Moser said warranty insurance products for PV projects “are growing at the same pace as the solar industry.” She added: “The specific market volume is hard to estimate. I can say, however, that our team at Munich Re has insured 41GW worldwide across 800 projects in 88 countries.”
Moser also stressed that effective risk management for large scale PV assets means covering the most significant risks. “The risk pyramid for PV risks clearly shows that we recommend focusing on two types, and these are external physical damage, and warranty risks,” she emphasized, adding that all other risk coverage types can be gained from less specialized providers but using such companies would probably mean less efficient focus in respect to PV risks. “You can think about general liability insurance, property risk insurance, environmental risk insurance, business interruption insurance, or revenue coverage,” she affirmed.

“Alliander and GroenLeven will investigate how hydrogen can play a role in areas where the capacity of the electricity grid is not sufficient to host new large scale solar capacity,” the two companies said, referring to recent network capacity issues in the northern Netherlands.
Alliander wants to evaluate, in particular, if grid congestion in the area can be reduced or prevented and whether hydrogen would enable spending fewer resources on grid expansion.
The hydrogen production unit will be operated by Alliander and will be linked to a nearby, 50MW solar park operated by Groenleven. The green hydrogen generated at the new facility will be purchased by local taxi company Kort and fuel supplier OrangeGas at an unspecified price. “It is expected that 100,000kg of hydrogen can be produced annually, which is enough for about 10 million clean kilometers of car journeys with a passenger car,” Alliander stated. GroenLeven will investigate how green hydrogen can be stored and used for other applications.
“The pilot project that we are implementing together with GroenLeven gives us the opportunity to see if hydrogen can contribute to the efficient use of our electricity grids,” the company's CEO, Daan Schut, emphasized. “By making hydrogen with the electricity generated from the solar park, and using it as fuel to drive cars, we are burdened less and no sustainably-generated energy is lost.”
According to the Dutch energy provider, hydrogen is expected to flow through the pipelines of the installation for the first time in June.
Alliander recently reported that congestion on its medium-voltage network is increasing due to rapidly growing demand from solar projects, data centers, and other energy-intensive industries, such as the greenhouse-horticulture sector.
Dutch transmission system operator Enexis, natural gas infrastructure company Gasunie and energy firm Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij BV (NAM) began considering using excess solar power generation capacity in the northeastern Netherlands for hydrogen production in late 2019.

Battery-powered vehicles and battery energy storage systems at every scale mostly use lithium-ion chemistry, but high costs and concerns with thermal events have driven US labs to investigate other low-cost, safe alternatives. One such alternative is the sodium-ion battery.
When cycled at a high voltage around 4.5V, sodium-ion batteries can significantly increase their energy density. However, rapid degradation in charge-discharge cycles have barred sodium-ion batteries from reaching commercialization.
Researchers at Argonne National Laboratory discovered an effect in the creation of the cathode material that may lead to improvements in battery resiliency. It was found that during the rapid cooling process in the creation of the cathode, a “structural earthquake” occurs, which disrupts the atomic makeup of the material.
During rapid cooling in cathode synthesis, the particle surface became rough, and large areas showed strain on the material. The effect was also found when cycling the cathode at high temperatures above 130 F or when performing fast-charging of one hour versus a 10-hour charge cycle.
With the knowledge of this structure-damaging event, cathode makers can now adjust synthesis conditions to create a purer cathode that is better able to pair the anode material. Earlier research by the team also led to an improved anode, and the team expects pairing the two will have dramatic effects.
“Now, we should be able to match our improved cathode with the anode to attain a 20% to 40% increase in performance,” said Guiliang Xu, assistant chemist in Argonne’s chemical sciences and engineering division.  “Also important, such batteries will maintain that performance with long-term cycling at high voltage.”
The results were recently published in Nature Communications. The Argonne team said the findings could result in a longer range and more affordable electric vehicles, as well as low-cost energy storage for the grid.
“Seeing is believing,” said scientist Yuzi Liu. “With Argonne’s world-class scientific facilities, we do not have to guess what is happening during the synthesis.”

The company said the storage module will enable the use of the tank to store hydrogen in applications other than automobiles.
“The 70 megapascals (MPa) resin high-pressure hydrogen tank developed for automobiles is now the subject of numerous requests from those who would like to use it in railways, shipping, and port cargo handling, as well as fuel cell generators,” it said. “Toyota developed this hydrogen storage module as a way to answer these demands and expand the use of hydrogen.”
It also added that the resin high-pressure hydrogen was already tested in its Mirai fuel cell vehicle and safety devices such as hydrogen detectors and automatic shut-off switches. Depending on the size, these tanks have a storage capacity of 2.7 kg to 18.7 kg and a tank mass ranging from 43.0 kg to 243.8 kg
The module unit, according to the manufacturer, embeds safety-assured tanks and is equipped with several safety devices that automatically monitor the module operation status.
“As storing and transporting hydrogen more safely and efficiently can be done through high-capacity hydrogen loads, it is possible to use hydrogen-based energy in a range of locations where hydrogen filling is difficult, such as ports or mountain areas,” it explained. “Toyota will be working on connecting with new business partners and carrying out verification testing with the idea of expanding hydrogen use even further.”
Toyota demonstrated its first hydrogen tank for automobiles in 2001 and is one of the most active carmakers now developing technologies for fuel cell vehicles. It has produced the vehicle-mounted 70 MPa tanks since 2008, and more than 20,000 were produced for the first generation of Mirai vehicles.
