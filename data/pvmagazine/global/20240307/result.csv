A 10% increase year on year, Wood Mackenzie says the growth came “despite sector cost headwinds, logistics tensions, and the energy crisis” in 2023. 
PV capacity was the most awarded form of renewable energy through government tenders last year. The Asia-Pacific region received two-thirds of government contracts worldwide, at approximately 90 GW. This was buoyed by China, where more than 55 GW were allocated through 49 renewable energy tenders. India awarded 20 GW over 55 tenders, while Germany was the largest player in Europe, with 19 GW awarded through 11 rounds.
Wood Mackenzie is now predicting government tenders will drive at least 102 GW of global renewable capacity in 2024, including at least 60 GW of offshore wind. It anticipates that the overall volume will grow as the year progresses, eventually matching 2023 levels.
“Tenders have increased each year, and Wood Mackenzie expects to see some big rewards in 2024 – the EMEA region will hold more than 50% of expected tenders, mostly for offshore wind capacity,” said Ana Fernandez Garcia, a senior research analyst at the firm. “Individual major markets, such as China, will continue to dominate.”
WoodMac’s analysis says renewable energy tenders are currently experiencing two opposing trends. It explains that while the offshore wind energy sector has witnessed “intense competition,” resulting in subsidy-free tenders and negative bids, onshore and solar energy tenders have gone undersubscribed. 
The research firm says the lack of interested bidders left 30% of the tendered volume unallocated in 2023. It adds that zero bidding has led to canceling contracts later in the developing phase of projects.
Fernandez Garcia says both situations put renewables deployment at risk and illustrate the need for tender design reform. She adds that Wood Mackenzie expects an increase in ceiling prices and non-price criteria to play a prominent role in the year ahead.
Wood Mackenzie’s latest analysis follows recent research on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) in the Asia-Pacific region, and predictions for annual PV growth through 2032, both published earlier this year.

Earlier this week, the company confirmed that the 25 MW/100 MWh EVx system, located in Rudong, China's Jiangsu province, was connected in December 2023, enabling full commissioning by State Grid Corp. of China. The Rudong EVx project will be the world’s first commercial, utility-scale, non-pumped hydro gravity energy storage system once final provincial and state approvals are obtained for the start of commercial operations.
Work on the Rudong project began in 2022, when Energy Vault said it would build five storage projects in China using its EVx technology, with a combined storage capacity of 2 GWh. Commissioning began on the project, which is next to a wind power facility, in August 2023. 
Energy Vault’s latest announcement coincides with reports of new EVx projects it is working on with its partners, CNTY and Atlas Renewable Energy. Construction began on a 17MW/68MWh EVx GESS deployment in China last year, alongside two previously announced projects in the country: a 50MW/200MWh EVx and a 25 MW/100 MWh EVx.
The update means CNTY and Atlas Renewable now have nine EVx GESS deployments underway in China, totalling 3.7 GWh.
The EVx projects are being built adjacent to renewable energy generation and national grid interconnection sites. Energy Vault said that upon completion, the systems will support the balancing of China’s national energy grid through the storage and delivery of renewable energy.
The Rudong and Zhangye projects have been designated as new energy storage pilot demonstration projects by China’s National Energy Administration. Energy Vault said the recognition, which will see increased management oversight by provincial-level energy authorities, “emphasizes the indispensable role of gravity energy storage in the crucial mission of global decarbonization, in particular in China.”
China’s existing energy policies require renewable energy plants to integrate storage of 20% of their nameplate generation capacity with at least a two-to-four hour duration. Energy Vault says energy storage durations will increase over time as more renewable energy generation becomes a larger percentage of grid power.
In February, Energy Vault signed a 10-year agreement to deploy its energy storage tech across the 16 nations of the Southern African Development Community region. It also announced it had begun construction of largest green hydrogen long-duration energy storage project in the United States to date, in northern California.

The 1 MW Sand Battery will be capable of storing up to 100 MWh of thermal energy – a capacity equivalent to almost one month of heating demand in the summer and one week of demand in Pornainen in the winter. Polar Night Energy said its Sand Battery works as a high-power, high-capacity reservoir for excess wind and solar energy, storing energy in sand as heat.
It will deliver the system as a turnkey project, including testing of the battery, which will be approximately 13 meters high and 15 meters wide. Development and construction are expected to take around 13 months.
The Sand Battery will be integrated with Loviisan Lämpö's district heating network. It will be charged from the electric grid using charging algorithms developed by Polar Night Energy, which the company said will minimize the cost of electricity used for charging, while meeting demand from the district heating network.
The battery will also help to reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions from the district heating network of Pornainen by nearly 70%, according to Polar Night Energy. Liisa Naskali, the COO of Polar Night Energy, said the project is “a significant step in scaling up the sand battery technology.”
The thermal energy storage system will use crushed soapstone as its storage medium. Sand batteries can use sand or sand-like materials as a storage material. Polar Night Energy said soapstone conducts heat better than conventional sand. It will get soapstone from Tulikivi, a Finnish company specializing in heat-retaining fireplaces, which produces soapstone as a byproduct of its manufacturing process.
“We always choose the thermal energy storage medium based on the customer's needs. Examining and testing different materials is crucial for us – to use materials that are suitable in terms of properties, cost-effectiveness, and promotion of circular economy,” said Naskali. “Tulikivi is a well-known and traditional company. The soapstone they use is a very Finnish thing.”
In 2022, Polar Night Energy switched on the world’s first commercial sand-based, high-temperature heat storage system in the Finnish city of Kankaanpää, with 100 kW of heating power and 8 MWh of energy capacity. In December 2023, it announced a partnership with Nordic energy company Ilmatar to develop its sand battery with power-to-heat-to-power capabilities.

The Chinese solar module manufacturer said that the new NEG9R.25 product has a power output of 450 W. It measures
1,762 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weighs 21 kg.
The modules use glass on the front and back are each 1.6 millimeters thick. They offer a power conversion efficiency of 22.5%.
The manufacturer achieved an all-black aesthetic by incorporating black cells with thin busbars, along with a black frame and encapsulation material.
It said the solar modules are highly resistant to scratches, cracks and other damage-related issues. They are reportedly resistant to the most adverse environmental conditions, such as salt spray, acids, alkalis, high temperatures and humidity.
The modules have passed the 35 mm hail test and requirements for IEC fire protection. Their mechanical resilience is also purportedly high, according to Trina Solar. It said they can withstand snow loads of up to 5,400 Pascals and wind loads of 4,000 Pascals.
Trina Solar offers a product guarantee of up to 25 years and a performance guarantee of 30 years. It claims the modules have low degradation rates.

Encavis, a Hamburg-based wind and solar project operator, has announced plans to build one of the largest PV plants in Germany through its Encavis Asset Management AG (Encavis AM) subsidiary.
The project will be located in the municipality of Bartow, in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany.
The plant will be built for Encavis Infrastructure Fund IV (EIF IV) on a site spanning 205 hectares. Construction of the first phase is scheduled to begin this month, with completion scheduled for the summer of 2025. The schedule for the second construction phase has yet to be determined. The total output of the solar project is expected to be 260 MW, and the annual electricity yield has been estimated at 270 GWh.
The company, which claims a PV portfolio of around 2.2 GW of installed capacity across more than 200 projects, said it wants to demonstrate its “competence for demanding investments in the field of renewable energy” with the project in Bartow.
“Based on our experience and knowledge, we will ensure that the solar park is operated not only ecologically, but also economically profitably,” said board spokesman Karsten Mieth.
Refinancing through funds from the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) is not possible for a project of this size, but Encavis has yet to provide any information about the sale of the electricity.
Upon completion, the Witznitz solar park could be Germany's largest solar project, adding more than 600 MW to the grid.

6,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/07/perovskite-thin-film-out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",,2024-03-07,"Perovskite thin film: Out with the old, in with the new","High conversion efficiency, earth-abundant material composition, and lower cost of manufacturing make perovskites a potential game changer for the solar industry. But what is the best path forward for commercialization of this exciting technology?
There has been a strong focus in the United States and in the media on perovskite-silicon tandem devices due to their potential to boost the efficiency of traditional silicon-based modules and leverage the existing silicon manufacturing base. However, research by the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) shows that single junction perovskites can help the nation scale domestic solar quickly and free itself from a reliance on imported silicon-based products. When it comes to design, the climate crisis, energy security, and cost performance, perovskite thin film just makes more sense.
Less is more when it comes to product design, and the environmental benefit of a clean transition away from silicon is compelling. NREL says silicon makes up 76% of the embodied energy of a PV module, whereas thin film cells make up less than 1%. Columbia University found perovskite thin film manufacturing can reduce cumulative energy use below that of both silicon and perovskite-silicon tandems by 80% or more, regardless of production method. While silicon wafers are very thin, at 160-240 micrometers, perovskite solar cells are thinner than 1.5 micrometers – less than the thickness of a red blood cell. With thin film PV modules requiring significantly less material to manufacture, less waste passes to the end user. With perovskite-silicon tandem devices, that waste is perpetuated.
Efforts are being made to keep more PV modules out of landfills, but recycling is costly and energy intensive. To become economically viable, the recycling industry is developing more efficient methods to recover high value materials such as precious metals and silicon. The alternative is to eliminate those materials entirely and design for recyclability of a more sustainably manufactured product. Life cycle analysis by German research body Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin found a transition from carbon-intensive silicon to perovskites added more value than any effort to improve the PV module recycling rate. If we can eliminate the highest carbon emitting component of a PV module and replace it with a more sustainable, lower cost technology, why not choose that over the hybrid? This is a no-brainer for utility power, where lowest cost of energy is the most important metric. Higher-efficiency solar solutions are often relegated to space constrained niche markets due to their cost.
China has become the global leader of PV module manufacturing but there are, quite literally, cracks in that dominance: silicon cells are inherently fragile and susceptible to microcracks. Despite efforts to minimize that risk, a recent report by Clean Energy Associates noted an exponential growth in cell crack cases in 2023, increasing 47% from the year prior. NREL research of 170 crystalline silicon systems in its PV Fleet Database found a trend of power loss after high wind and hail events, which could likely be attributed to microcracks when no glass breakage is found. This problem will not disappear with silicon perovskite tandems, but it can be resolved with thin film manufacturing. Case in point, First Solar is the only major manufacturer to offer a cell crack power loss guarantee due to the resilience of its thin film cells to mechanical stress.
Perovskites have reliability challenges to be overcome as part of commercialization, but these are challenges for both single junction and tandem technology. Beyond microcrack risk, silicon tandems face compatibility issues due to the need to optimize two technologies simultaneously to justify the added cost. How will degradation or discoloration of perovskite top cells affect performance of silicon bottom cells over time? What are the potential power measurement and sorting complications? If different manufacturers are responsible for the top and bottom cell, who will take responsibility for warranties?
It is not clear yet whether tandem startups are positioning as cell suppliers, seeking to be bought by module makers, or establishing their own manufacturing capacity. A simpler, lower cost product made by one supplier appears to be a less risky path to market.
From an energy security perspective, developing a component in the United States that supports a product made almost entirely in China does not sound like a winning strategy. As the Inflation Reduction Act's domestic content waiver for Asian silicon and wafers demonstrates, there is little hope the United States will be able to compete with China on silicon. Japan understands this and has invested heavily in thin film perovskite R&D. If the United States focuses only on perovskite-silicon tandem development, it could inadvertently forfeit perovskite technology to other countries.
The United States must build on past successes, not repeat the same mistakes. While US efforts to build a viable silicon supply chain have faltered, cadmium telluride (CadTel) thin-film solar has weathered the storm with a focus on manufacturing innovation and development of a more reliable, responsible supply chain. This is clearly the best way for the United States to compete with China, and perovskites have the potential to leapfrog CadTel on cost with the help of high-speed roll-to-roll manufacturing. Technoeconomic analysis by the NREL indicates capital expenditure for perovskites can be cut in half with a shift away from sheet-to-sheet manufacturing. With strong industry investment and the continued support of consortiums like US-MAP and PACT, we can push that gap even wider and scale United States manufacturing capacity faster than ever.

GUVNL has concluded its 250 MW/500 MWh standalone battery energy storage tender at a tariff of around $5,429/MW per month – 58% lower than the tariff reached in Solar Energy Corporation of India's (SECI) 500 MW/1000 MWh auction in 2022.
Gensol won 70 MW by quoting the lowest bid of INR 448,996 ($5,425)/MW per month. IndiGrid secured 180 MW at INR 449,996/MW per month.
The winners will install BESS with a capacity of 500 MWh (250 MW x two hours) in the state of Gujarat, with the primary objective of making the energy storage facility available to GUVNL for charging-discharging on an on-demand basis. The projects are to be developed under a build-own-operate (BOO) model.
GUVNL will enter into battery energy storage purchase agreements with the successful bidders.
The BESS will be charged by drawing power from GETCO and injecting it into the GETCO network according to the dispatch instructions issued by SLDC in consultation with GUVNL. GUVNL will provide the required power for charging the BESS considering the minimum system efficiency under the agreement.
The developers will make the BESS available for two operational cycles per day – that is, two complete charge-discharge cycles per day.

8,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/07/ppa-upside-for-large-scale-solar-grows-in-australia/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-03-07,PPA upside for large-scale solar grows in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
Net-zero pledges, corporate responsibility, and compelling cost competitiveness is leading a growing number of Australian companies to sign offtake agreements with solar and wind power projects. With both the size and number of these deals expanding, power purchase agreements (PPAs) are shaping as a major driver for large-scale PV in the coming years.
“Looking at the [emissions reduction] targets of the utilities, some of the industrials, and where they need to get to by 2030 there will be offtake agreements,” says David Dixon, a Sydney-based senior analyst with Rystad Energy.
Dixon points to new data centers, in places like Sydney, as adding sizeable new electricity load, that can be supplied by large-scale solar.
Indeed, tech giants like Google, Apple, and Meta (formerly Facebook) have been drivers of utility-scale PV deployment by virtue of the large PPAs they have signed.
On Feb. 7, Amazon signed a 125 MW PPA with Singapore-based Vena Energy for a project located in Wandoan, which is approximately 350 km north east of Brisbane.
By virtue of the PPA, the project received a new name – the Amazon Solar Project Australia. It will remain owned by Vena. The duration of the PPA is confidential. The solar project is part of the larger Wandoan South Project – which comprises 650 MW of solar and is set to be coupled with 450 MW of battery energy storage.
“Amazon is on a path to power our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, and we’re proud to deliver new solar and wind projects in Australia, driving strong sustainability outcomes for our customers and local communities,” said Ken Haig, head of energy and environment policy, Asia Pacific and Japan at Amazon Web Services. He noted that Amazon has invested “billions” in Australia.
The 125 MW “Amazon” solar project deploys Risen Modules, central inverters from Power Electronics, and single-axis trackers from PV Hardware. A spokesperson from Vena concurred that PPAs with companies such as Amazon play an important role in solar project’s reaching financial close.
“Based on our experience, securing an offtake agreement with a creditworthy and renowned counterparty like Amazon significantly enhances a project’s appeal to debt capital, due to the enhanced financial stability and reduced risk profile such an agreement brings to the project,” the Vena spokesperson explained.
“When we think about whether a project gets to financial close, we only think about three things: grid, having a spot on the grid is a big challenge in Australia; two is whether you have all of the approvals, but there are enough solar projects approved; and the third is revenue – if you don’t have that, particularly for solar, the bank is not going to lend you money,” said Dixon. “Corporate PPAs do still come in.”
Dixon pointed to the 1.1 GW deal miner Rio Tinto signed with the Upper Calliope Solar Farm planned for the Gladstone region in Queensland. Construction on the project is set to begin in 2025 or 2026.
On Feb. 21,Rio also signed a PPA to purchase 80% of the power generated by the massive, planned 1.4 GW Bungaban wind energy project.
Investment bank Macquarie noted that Rio is looking to procure 4 GW of solar and wind power for its operations, in particular for “repowering its aluminium assets at Gladstone (Boyne Smelter, Yurwin Alumina Refinery and Queensland Alumina Refinery) with green electricity.”
Between the major miners and tech companies, PPAs are proving a significant driver of large-scale renewable deployment in Australia, during a period in which price cannibalization is causing significant headwinds.
In Sydney alone, Rystad charts 600 MW of new electricity load from data centres that is coming online.
“Even though there are cheap [wholesale electricity] prices in the middle of the day, there are new, large industrial loads – and a good example is data centres and the aluminum smelters,” said Dixon.

The company said its new FGAH-AH heat pump is an ideal solution for offices, shops, hotels and industrial buildings in a 2-pipe change-over system
The new product is available in six versions with a cooling capacity ranging from 14 kW to 36 kW and a heating capacity of 15 kW to 41 kW. It uses difluoromethane (R-32) as a refrigerant. R-32 has a global warming potential (GWP) of 677, which is 66% lower than R-410A.
The heat pump can purportedly operate at down to -20 C outside temperature and provide hot water at a temperature of 45 C. With an outside temperature above -5 C, the hot water temperature can reach up to 60 C.
“The control option of on-site auxiliary heating rods also enables bivalent-parallel or bivalent-alternative operation,” the manufacturer stated. “In summer, the units can be switched to cooling mode with media temperatures between -8 and 18 C.”
FlätGroup said the heat pump has a seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) of up to 4.76 for low-temperature applications and 3.48  for medium temperatures.
“The units are equipped as standard with energy-efficient and controllable EC fans, electronic expansion valves, as well as a hydrophilic coating of the copper-aluminum heat exchanger to improve the condensate drainage in heating mode,” the company said in a statement. “Optionally, built-in speed-controlled pumps, as well as a suitable expansion vessel are available to reduce installation times and wiring effort. The speed-controlled scroll compressors adapt the heating and cooling capacity to the current demand in a wide working range.”

Chelion Australia said the first shipments of its new all-in-one residential solar power storage solution arrived in the Australia in late February and the first of those units have now been installed.
“This has already started rolling out,” Chelion Business Development Manager Isaac Turner said at the Smart Energy Expo in Sydney. “Our first container came in about three weeks ago and we maybe have 20 units left. The next container is coming in June.”
Chelion said the iHome-S-HD1H01 series is a modular, lithium iron phosphate DC/AC-coupled storage solution. It offers flexible expansion in 5 kWh modules up to 40 kWh.
The company said each module has a built-in DC/DC converter that is “pre-optimized to perform at the highest level.” The systems come equipped with internal smart metering and a powerful energy management system. The batteries have a round-trip efficiency of about 90% and offer a number of operational modes, including self-consumption, off-grid, energy scheduling and back-up power of up to 7.8 kW.
Chelion said the systems are easily stackable, weighing it at 140 kg and measuring 800 mm x 1,235 mm x 200 mm. The system, which comes with a 10-year warranty, can be mounted on floors or walls.
The new iHome offering is part of a growing list of storage solutions offered by Brisbane-based Chelion Australia.
It is also supplying storage solutions for the commercial market, including the Matrix Ares and Zeus series. The Ares is a 163 kWh all-in-one unit, with integrated HVAC, while the Zeus is a liquid-cooled 301 kWh system.
Chelion said the Zeus offers “almost unlimited expandability” for clients with demanding peak-load or very-high efficiency AC output requirements.

“There is a lack of a national map of China’s PV power stations with a higher spatial resolution (i.e., 10 meters) that could provide a global understanding of PV’s spatial deployment patterns,” they explained. “Considering that the large-scale grounded-mounted PV power stations almost cover more than 90% of the total PV capacity in China, we attempt to provide the first publicly available 10-m national map of ground-mounted PV power stations in this dataset.”
To create the dataset, the research group used multi-spectral remote sensing data from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellites, together with digital elevation model (DEM) information from Google Earth Engine (GEE). Those were processed via the GEE cloud computing platform.

The processing was based on a random forest (RF) classifier, a machine-learning method consisting of many decision trees. It was trained on visual inspection of 320,000 PV and 320,00 non-PV samples. As PV stations and the surroundings look different across the vast land of China, RF was used on a province level. In some cases, where even the provinces were too big, they were further divided into sub-sections.
“During the mapping process, it would be difficult to produce an accurate map with automatic classification once and only once. In this situation, we resorted to active learning,” they said. “The core idea of active learning is described as follows. Firstly, train a classifier with initial labeled data, then use the trained classifier to predict the entire dataset. Afterwards, the wrongly predicted unlabelled data would be sent to experts. Then, the classifier would be re-trained with both the initial and the newly labeled data. The above process would be run in an iterative way until a satisfactory classification result would be achieved.”
The group validated the national-scale testing dataset by selecting a total of 5,000 positive samples and 5,000 negative samples and asked the model to identify them. The model has reached an accuracy of 88.36% for samples containing PV and 89.94% for non-PV samples.
“According to our dataset, China has a total of 2,467.7 km2 ground-mounted PV power stations in 2020. The top three largest provinces refer to Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Qinghai, whose PV area ratios are 14.92%, 12.49%, and 11.26%, respectively, with a total of nearly 40% of all the PV power stations in China,” the academics explained. “Among the rest provinces, both Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei and Shaanxi witness a PV area ratio above 5%, which contributes to another 20% of China’s PV power stations in total.”
Most of the stations lie in the northern part of China, especially in northwest and northeast China. “Interestingly, a large number of PV power stations lie along the Great Wall (including the northern parts of Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia and Gansu Province) and the Silk Road (mainly refers to Gansu and Xinjiang Province),” they said. “In eastern China, PV power stations mainly locate in Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Hubei and Jiangxi Province, while in southwestern China, Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan witnessed the most PV power stations.”
Concluding the article, the academic group said it will release in the future new maps that are based on data from different years. The current dataset was presented in “A 10-m national-scale map of ground-mounted photovoltaic power stations in China of 2020,” published in Scientific Data. It was created by scientists from China Agricultural University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the United Kingdom’s University of Cambridge.

We are in the midst of a year-long acceleration in the decline of battery cell prices – a trend that is reminiscent of recent solar cell price reductions.
Since last summer, lithium battery cell pricing has plummeted by approximately 50%, according to Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), the world’s largest battery manufacturer. In early summer 2023, publicly available prices ranged from CNY 0.8 ($0.11)/Wh to CNY 0.9/Wh, or about $110/kWh to $130/kWh.

Pricing initially fell by about about one-third by the end of summer 2023. Now, as reported by CnEVPost, large EV battery buyers are acquiring cells at CNY 0.4/Wh, representing a price decline of 50% to 56%. Leapmotor CEO Cao Li said the company expects further reductions, with prices potentially dropping to CNY 0.32/Wh this summer, for a decline of 60% to 64% within a single year.
EnergyTrend said that energy storage battery cells are priced similarly to electric vehicle battery cells.
CnEVPost also reports that the battery cells being sold come equipped with advanced technologies, including faster charge rates, higher cycle life, improved temperature management characteristics, and higher energy density packaging.
A Goldman Sachs report in February attributes the accelerated price declines partly to a slight slowdown in electric vehicle adoption, leading to lower commodity prices. The finance group revised its growth projection for global battery demand to 29% for 2024, down from the previous estimate of 35%, with 31% growth expected in 2023.

The First Solar European Technology Center was formerly known as Evolar, a company founded in 2019 from now-insolvent CIGS thin-film manufacturer Solibro. It was then acquired by First Solar in May 2023. The company focuses on developing solutions, including manufacturing equipment, to commercialize tandem solar technology with perovskite thin films.
The new solar cell achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 23.75% and a certified efficiency of 23.64%, thus beating the previous world record of 23.35% achieved in 2019 by Japan's Solar Frontier. Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) confirmed the result.
“We achieved this by combining four different approaches,” the research's lead author, Jan Keller, told pv magazine. “We added a relatively high concentration of silver to the absorber and implemented a ‘hockey stick'-like gallium (Ga) depth profile. Furthermore, we tailored a rubidium fluoride (RbF) post-deposition treatment (PDT) to the absorber composition and subjected the absorber to extended illumination.”
These processes, according to the research team, were able to improve the microstructure, reduce the defect density and mitigate band gap fluctuations, passivate the absorber surface and increase the doping density. “Overall, this led to a reduced open-circuit voltage deficit, resulting in a high external radiative efficiency of 1.6%,” Keller added.
Presented in the study “High-concentration silver alloying and steep back-contact gallium grading enabling copper indium gallium selenide solar cell with 23.6% efficiency,” which was recently published in nature Energy, the cell was built with a glass substrate coated with molybdenum (Mo), sodium fluoride (NaF) layer, the CIGS absorber, the RbF layer, a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, a window layer of zinc oxide (i-ZnO), an aluminum doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) film, and an anti-reflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2).
The scientists explained that they used a relatively high amount of silver in the absorber and placed a ‘hockey stick ’-like gallium profile with a high Ga concentration close to the Mo back contact and a lower, constant concentration in the region closer to the CdS buffer layer. They also applied a standard RbF post-deposition treatment (PDT), which they said allowed to reduce the thickness of the CdS buffer layer to 25 nm.
“Our study demonstrates that CIGS thin-film technology is a competitive alternative as a stand-alone solar cell. The technology also has properties that can function in other contexts, such as the bottom cell of a tandem solar cell,” the research team said.
Looking forward, the scientists said they could raise the cell efficiency to over 25%. This should be achieved by avoiding parasitic absorption in the window and buffer layers, while maintaining the same open-circuit voltage and fill factor levels.  “To go beyond this level, the absorber quality has to be further improved and external radiative efficiency (ERE) values much higher than 1.6% need to be realized to further reduce the open-circuit voltage deficit and the ideality factor,” they concluded.
