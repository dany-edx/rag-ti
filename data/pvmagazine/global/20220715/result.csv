Debashish Bhattacharjee, Vice President New Materials Business visited Swansea’s Bay Campus earlier this week to sign a memorandum of understanding for the three-year research project, which is part of a broader collaboration between the two, focused on reducing the environmental impacts of the steel industry.

“The future is about solar energy technology being built in, not added on afterwards. These printable solar cells can be built into the fabric of our homes, shops and offices, allowing them to generate the power they need, and more besides,” said Dave Worsley, head of materials science and engineering at Swansea University. “We know the concept works as we’ve demonstrated it in our Active Buildings in sunny Swansea. This new collaboration with Tata Steel will enable us to develop its potential more quickly, identifying new types of steel products that actively work to generate electricity.”
The research will be conducted as part of Swansea’s “active buildings” project, which demonstrates a range of energy generation, storage, and efficiency technologies integrated into classroom and office buildings at the university campus.
Swansea University will lend its experience with perovskite materials and solar cell printing processes to the project, while Tata will focus on material supply chains, as well as adapting it steel coatings to have solar cells deposited on top of them. With the university located close to Swansea’s Port Talbot Steelworks, the two have collaborated on various projects in the past focused on both steel production and renewable energy.
“We are buoyant with the possibilities that the perovskite technology brings to the table – especially in integration to the building and construction solutions – across different value streams in Tata Steel,” said Sumitesh Das, UK R&D director for Tata Steel. “The combination of a ‘green' solar technology with steel is a significant step in our net zero ambitions.”

The lawsuit is related to six alleged infringement claims regarding the US patents 8,823,218, 8,933,321, 9,584,021, 9,966,848, 10,256,770, and 10,333,405.
“The complaint is focused on various systems and methods used in module-level rapid shutdown units that are attached to photovoltaic panels,” Tige Energy said in a statement released, noting that the complaint alleges that SMA and some of its suppliers copied Tigo innovations included in Tigo Flex MLPE solutions, which comply with rapid shutdown requirements of the NFPA 70 – the US National Electrical Code (NEC).
“This is not about all SMA's units worldwide, but exclusively about SMA America LLC,” a spokesperson from the German inverter maker told pv magazine.” The company does not want to comment on the details of an ongoing legal dispute, but points out that the US Patent Office had previously launched an investigation into some of the Tigo patents related to the new lawsuit.
The SunSpec Alliance, a US group of energy industry participants pursuing standards for Distributed Energy Resource (DER), had previously  challenged the validity of two of Tigo Energy's patents in July 2021. It applied to the US Patent Office for an inter partes review (IPR).
SunSpec's filings challenged the validity of certain claims in US Patent Nos. 8,933,321 and 10,256,770, which also appear in the lawsuit against SMA's US subsidiary, and in which Tigo previously alleged patent infringements against APsystems. Tigo has claimed that these patents are relevant to the SunSpec Rapid Shutdown specification. However, SunSpec considers this allegation to be “unsubstantiated and inaccurate” and decided to file the IPR filings to defend itself against Tigo's allegations.
The US Patent and Trademark Office began the process of reviewing and reexamining the patentability of Tigo's ‘321 and ‘770 patents in late January. A hearing is planned for this November.

If confirmed, these figures would represent year-on-year growth of 124.3% and 152.3%, respectively. The company said the strong performance is due to increasing demand and raising module prices.
Wafer producer TCL Zhonghuan said it expects its revenue to grow from CNY 17.6 billion in the first six months of last year to up to CNY 33 billion in the same period of 2022. Net profit is estimated to be between CNY 2.85 billion and CNY 3.05 billion.
Polysilicon maker GCL Tech this week said it expects a bumper, unaudited first-half profit of around CNY 6.9 billion, up from CNY 2.4 billion a year earlier. That came on the back of six-month revenue estimated at CNY 15.4 billion, up from CNY 8.8 billion, with CNY 14.7 billion generated from the turnover from producing around 40,000 tons of poly during the period at an average gross profit margin of 48%. There was a contrast in fortune at GCL’s New Energy project business, which warned shareholders it expects a net loss of CNY 300 million for the first half, after selling off 2.1 GW of the 3 GW solar estate it had at the end of June 2021. GCL said the value of the dollar against the yuan also contributed a CNY 130 million hit to the six-month figures. GCL New Energy banked a CNY 180 million net profit in the first half of last year.
Battery raw materials supplier Ganfeng Lithium this week said it expects a first-half net profit for shareholders of CNY 7.2 billion to CNY 9 billion, up from CNY 1.42 billion from the same period last year. It put the improved performance down to demand for its products from the new energy industry.
Polysilicon maker and solar developer Xinte Energy has secured an eight-year, 201,900-ton deal to supply the solar panel raw material to wafer maker Shuangliang Silicon Materials (Baotou) Co Ltd. Starting in January, Xinte this week said the product would be priced monthly. The latest polysilicon price published by the silicon industry branch of the China Non-ferrous Metals Industry Association would value the deal at CNY 58.5 billion.
State-owned developer Beijing Energy International this week announced a subsidiary has secured the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract for a 100 MW agrivoltaic project in Qionghai city, Hainan province. The agreement, from state-owned Powerchina Jiangxi Electric Power Construction Co Ltd and private entity Sichuan Tongli Hengneng Power Enegineering Design Co Ltd, will be worth CNY 480 million. Beijing Energy recently awarded a CNY 317 million EPC contract for the 150 MW first phase of a planned 300 MW agrivoltaic project in Baise city, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.
PV module manufacturer JinkoSolar signed a cooperation agreement with US-based Cummins for the joint development of hydrogen projects. The two companies will initially participate in tenders for the construction of large-scale PV-powered hydrogen plants.

“Our device was not designed to achieve the maximum possible power conversion efficiency, but represents a prototype to study the applicability of the 4T multijunction approach and its compatibility with bifacial modules,” research co-author Andrea Scuto, told pv magazine. “It is suitable to illustrate the advantages of the 4T architecture including the bifacial technology already in production in Italy,” he added referring to the module production of Enel Green Power, which also partnered in the research.
In the paper “Outdoor performance of GaAs/bifacial Si heterojunction four-terminal system using optical spectrum splitting,” published in Solar Energy, the scientists explained that in the 4T design the bottom and top cells are not directly stacked and connected in series, but are connected in parallel. This architecture reportedly offers the advantage of considerable intrinsic robustness to variations in the solar spectrum.
“For such reason, the 4T configuration is much more robust than the tandem to changes of solar spectrum or to the bifaciality use,” the researchers explained. “4T devices also have a higher degree of flexibility for the choice of materials that best absorb the incident spectrum since no direct cell stacking and short-circuit current matching is necessary. Only the voltage matching of the bottom and top PV module has to be performed.”
The prototype was built with a dichroic mirror on the front of the device that splits the incident light. In this way, the GaAs mini-module is able to transform the visible portion of the solar spectrum, while the bifacial SHJ cell collects the incident infrared light on the front, and the light reflected from the ground on the rear of the device.
The system was tested in outdoor conditions and, throughout a full day, it exhibited a power conversion efficiency ranging from 21.3% to 25.4%, with the efficiency raising by 17% (relative) when it went from monofacial to bifacial operation. “We have acquired irradiance data and monitored the spectral distribution of the solar light during the day, observing a variation of 44% of the albedo and a significant shift of the solar spectrum towards infrared wavelengths,” the Italian group stated.
“The present system cannot effectively harvest diffuse light in the blue part of the solar spectrum due to the dichroic mirror, and the supporting structure increases the encumbrance of the system: for these reasons the device shouldn’t be considered for an industrial application. But the concept may be applied to more effective designs both in terms of form factor and cost” the authors specified.

Researchers at Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH) are currently investigating the durability and performance of PV inverters and power optimizers from a total of 1,280 PV systems located in Switzerland.
In their survey, the researchers considered the type of power electronics, the year the PV system was commissioned and the year the first energy-related fault occurred. Their evaluation revealed an average time until the first energy-related error occurred. “The results of all the inverters and power optimizers examined show that over 50 percent of the power electronics do not show any yield-relevant errors up to the age of 15,” the researchers wrote in their preliminary findings.
The data also showed that lifespans depend on various factors. For example, more powerful PV inverters have shorter service lives, while the power optimizers considered individually lasted the longest. However, it should be noted that the overall reliability of a PV system increases with a smaller number of electronic power components.
The Swiss scientists further found that outdoor power electronics are more susceptible to interference than indoor PV inverters and power optimizers. At the same time, they discovered that the first fault occurs earlier in PV systems with inverters with power optimizers than in systems that do not have power optimizers. The service life of the devices also varies depending on the manufacturer.
The researchers specified, however, that the validity of their results is limited, as it is a non-representative cross-section of the power electronics used in rooftop systems in Switzerland or Europe. The PV inverters considered came mainly from the manufacturers Fronius, Sputnik, and SMA and most of the power optimizers examined came from Solaredge.
The causes of the failures and defects have not yet been precisely recorded. In general, the failure of a power optimizer usually results in a lower loss of yield in a PV system rather than the failure of an inverter. Nevertheless, both defects were rated in the same in the evaluation. A fundamental distinction should also be made in that defective power optimizers are usually replaced, while defective inverters are repaired.
Despite the limited extent of their work, the BFH researchers did dare to draw a conclusion on their previous data. They believe, in fact, that the “the rule of thumb that inverters should run without faults for around 15 years” is confirmed by their findings. The research project will run until the end of 2025 and the investigation will be repeated in the future and extended to other systems.

Our partner Coveme then converted these into a range of backsheet structures for 1000 and 1500V applications, and those industrial trials have been successful with the film passing all of our weathering protocols. We are confident that backsheets with recycled content is a technically viable option, reducing the carbon footprint of our products and importantly giving another life to plastic waste.
Although higher levels are technically possible, we are targeting 33% content as we believe it gives a significant carbon footprint reduction and is consistent with various pieces of legislation in different markets which target 30 % recycled content as a benchmark.

Working with Coveme and ENEA, the Italian National Agency for new technologies, energy and sustainable economic development, we were able to demonstrate that backsheets can be successfully separated from the rest of the solar module, and then this recovered material can be recycled via glycolysis into two distinct plastic fractions.
The high value fraction is the recovered monomer (BHET), and we were able to demonstrate that the purity of this material was similar to virgin material and suitable for subsequent conversion into high end PET applications including backsheet films. The residual fraction was made up of the primer and adhesive layers and this was suitable as a feedstock for pyrolysis or energy recovery.
We are actively pursuing this concept and are looking for partners to run industrial scale size trials, partly to generate more data but most importantly to test out the economic viability of this process in the future.

In terms of product development our key focus is the continued scale up of clear films for both frontsheet and backsheet applications. From a sustainability perspective there is a significant carbon footprint saving by using Mylar UVHPET based clear backsheets when compared to fluorinated alternatives and particularly compared to double glass modules.
On the broader topic of sustainability, I believe our key task is to continue to present our test data and to share the track record of Mylar UVHPET based backsheets to make the case that a more sustainable backsheet is possible without compromising on product performance.
As the amount of modules reaching their end of life continue to rise we are already starting to see issues with the safe and economic disposal of a plastic fraction with a high level of fluorinated material already hitting the limits for disposal. This issue is going to continue to grow, and I think it is critical that we design for recycling now, and only use hazardous materials in module manufacture where there is a clear technical benefit of doing so.
The most important role a backsheet has is protecting the solar module throughout its lifetime, and the other issue we are spending resources on investigating is the growing use of coated backsheets, and whether these relatively thin, soft coatings can really protect modules from the kind of damage that can occur in the transit, installation, and maintenance of modules, and critically in harsh climates such as deserts where damage from sand can be a real issue. We now have a lot of data to show that certain coatings do not provide adequate protection in our opinion, and that potentially the drive for cost reductions is compromising product performance.
It is a cliché, but sustainability really is a journey and like everyone else we are continually learning more about this topic. We are actively looking to engage with our customers and suppliers on this topic, which I believe is especially important as we all focus on how to reduce our scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. We recently achieved a gold rating from EcoVadis which ranks us in the top 6% of comparable companies when it comes to sustainability which we are very proud of, and we continue to integrate best practice from Operation Clean Sweep into all of our manufacturing facilities.

In the first step, biomass is converted into syngas in a novel reactor using oxygen and steam. In the second step, pure hydrogen is generated from syngas using an indigenously developed low-pressure gas separation unit,” they said, noting that 60 g of hydrogen are present in 1 kg of biomass. According to their findings, the high yield has to do with the fact that steam participates in both homogenous and heterogeneous reactions. In homogeneous reactions, reactants are in a single phase, whereas in heterogeneous reactions, the reactants are in two or more phases. Solid carbon, which serves as a carbon sink, and carbon dioxide, which can be used in other processes, are the two carbon-based by-products, making the process carbon negative, said the researchers. 
India’s ACME, Norway's Scatec, and Oslo-based Yara have signed a term sheet for offtake from the first phase of their green ammonia production plans in Oman. ACME and Scatec will begin developing the first phase of the project over 12 km2 of land to produce 100,000 metric tonnes of green ammonia per annum in the Special Economic Zone at Duqm. Once fully developed, a second phase will scale up production, which should reach 1.1 million tonnes annually. “The parties have agreed the principal terms for offtake of 100,000 tonnes annually of green ammonia in a first phase, and potential further offtake from the projects second phase as this develops. This agreement is groundbreaking for enabling the partners’ first green ammonia project in Oman,” said Scatec.
A Japanese consortium including Toshiba Energy and Osaka-based municipal utility Kansai Electric Power Corporation, will conduct a study on hydrogen production utilizing unused geothermal energy in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. The project period is from this July to March 2023. “Currently, a portion of geothermal steam is not fully utilized. Through this project, Toshiba ESS will investigate the effective use of unused steam to produce stable and low-cost green hydrogen,” said Toshiba. The hydrogen should be used for industries’ heat demand in the surrounding region. After the study, Toshiba ESS aims to deploy the resulting business model and use geothermal power plants in Japan and overseas to increase its hydrogen production. 
Thyssengas is planning an 800-km hydrogen pipeline network in Germany by 2030. Thyssengas, which owns around 4,400 km of natural gas pipelines, is planning to retrofit around 18% of its network. The pipelines will be first hydrogen-ready and then gradually entirely converted for pure hydrogen transportation. “The hydrogen network planning is based on around 45 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) that Thyssengas concluded with potential hydrogen producers and customers as part of a market survey conducted by FNB Gas,” said the company. 
Three of the 17 projects selected by the European Commission for a total €1.8 billion investment are hydrogen-related. The first project, Holland Hydrogen, will be carried out by Shell in Rotterdam. The project will supply a 400 MW electrolyzer with Dutch offshore wind – a 200 MW trial by 2025 and 400 MW by 2027. The hydrogen will replace fossil fuels in the Pernis refinery. The second project, Furec, is being promoted by RWE Generation. “FUREC will process non-recyclable solid waste streams and transform them primarily into hydrogen,” said the Commission. The project will take place in a chemicals cluster at Geleen, the Netherlands. The third project will also be in the Netherlands. ELYgator, promoted by Air Liquide, will produce 15,5000 tones of hydrogen from a 200 MW electrolysis project in Terneuzen, targeting industry and mobility. 
Amazon’s US$2 billion Climate Pledge Fund announced new investments in Electric Hydrogen and Sunfire, two developers of electrolyzers.
The Port of Valencia has begun the installation of its hydrogen generator. The hydrogen supply station will have a two-stage water-cooled piston hydrogen compressor with heat exchangers integrated into the system, two groups of hydrogen storage cylinders at 300 and 450 bar, and a dispenser at 350 bar for heavy vehicles.

The group sees these mining sites as having potential for low-cost energy infrastructure. “Mine shafts are usually located in proximity to power plants and/or distribution stations,” the research group stated. “This allows the use of existing grid connection infrastructure. In addition, proximity to highly industrialized areas reduces energy transmission losses. The lack of requirement to build an aboveground TES storage tank economizes the limited space available.”

The system works without using external heat sources, and utilizes an air compressor, a compressed air reservoir with a built-in thermal energy storage system, and an air expander. The elements of the system can be either one- or two-sectional.
In the proposed system configuration, the TES tank is embedded and attached to the shaft casing. This helps reduce heat loss, even when the heat leaves the accumulation material and goes through the air in the shaft reservoir. The TES system itself is adapted to the geometry of the shaft, and the heat conduction field is reduced, which has a positive effect on the energy efficiency of the heat storage process.
“The greatest advantage of placing the TES system in the volume of the pressure reservoir is the possibility of using a thin-walled shell structure in which the thermal energy storage material is placed,” Bartela further explained. “This allows for a significant reduction in the cost of the TES system.”
Steel cylinders with a perforated underside are used to divide the tank into segments, which allows easy installation and periodic inspection of the heat-absorbing material bed. “Communication between the sections will be possible using ladders, which are also part of the TES vertical positioning system,” the scientists specified.
At the charging stage, electricity is used to drive the compressor. The hybrid underground system is charged with hot, compressed air injected into the reservoir through an inlet pipeline with a built-in shut-off valve. The air then flows through the TES system, heating the storage material.
In the discharge phase, air flows through the TES system taking heat from the accumulation material. Then, the hot air goes to the expander, which drives the generator that produces electricity. “It is advantageous to fill the TES unit with a suitable heat-accumulation material at a sufficient volume to absorb the heat, this is important for the high degree of cooling of the stored air,” the group emphasized. “By limiting the temperature of the storage air in contact with the underground reservoir shell, heat losses will be reduced and, as a result, the CAES system energy storage efficiency will be increased.”
They calculated for a compressed air storage facility with a volume of 60,000 m3 and a maximum pressure of 5 mega pascals (MPa). Based on this they calculated the facility's energy storage capacity at 140 MWh, round-trip efficiency of around 70%, and energy efficiency of 95 % for the heat storage tanks.
They also explained that, in exceptional situations, it is possible to maintain the air at a pressure of up to 8 MPa, depending on the specific characteristics of the mine shaft. “In this case, the energy capacity of the system may exceed 200 MWh,” Bartela emphasized. “The use of common rocks such as granite or basalt in the TES system will be most advantageous from an economic point of view. Currently, however, research is conducted at the Silesian University of Technology on alternative synthetic materials.”
The group introduced the energy storage concept in the study Evaluation of the energy potential of an adiabatic compressed air energy storage system based on a novel thermal energy storage system in a post mining shaft, which was recently published in the Journal of Energy Storage. “We are currently working only on optimizing the design of the heat storage tank, which could reduce the cost of the TES module,” Bartela concluded.
According to the group, there are 139 shafts in active coal mines in Poland and also 34 shafts in active copper and rock salt mines. Currently, 39 are scheduled for decommissioning, about half of which is used for pumping water. The deepest shafts are over 1,300 m deep.

The micro-inverters are available in three different versions with a rated power output of 550 volt-amperes (VA), 700 VA, and 2,800 VA. “The first two products can be connected to a single panel, while the largest micro-inverter can be connected to four panels,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “Our microinverters have the ability to achieve maximum power point tracking (MPPT) at the module level, which allows the overall output power to be maximized by optimizing the output power of each module.”
The smallest device is called BYM550 and is able to work with a solar module power range of 400 W to 670 W. It features an efficiency of 97.5% and a European efficiency of 97%. It measures 210 mm x 230 mm x 34 mm and weighs 2.38 kg. It allows the connection of up to 10 units per string.
The middle-sized inverter, dubbed BYM700, works with a panel power range of 450 W to 750 W. Its efficiency reaches 97.5% and the European efficiency is rated at 97%. It has a size of 210 mm x 230 mm x 34 mm and weighs in at s 2.38 kg. It enables the connection of up to eight units per string.
The largest micro-inverter – the BYM2800 – is able to work with solar modules in the power range of 450 W to 750 W. It can achieve the same efficiencies as the BYM550 product.
For all devices, the MPPT voltage range is 24-50 V and the operating voltage range is 16.56 V, while the maximum DC input voltage is 60 V and the maximum short-circuit current is 24 A. Furthermore, they all achieve an MPPT efficiency of 99.8%, and a night power consumption of less than 100 milliwatts. The devices also feature an IP67 enclosure rating and a cooling system based on natural convection.
The manufacturer offers a 25-year performance warranty and a 10-year product warranty for all the micro-inverters of the series.

According to trade body Swissolar this positive trend will continue in 2022, with predictions that between 850 and 900 MW will be deployed.
Last year, the residential solar segment grew by around 60% while the commercial and industrial segment saw an around 53% increase. The average size of newly installed PV systems was 25.3 kW, which also shows some growth in the utility-scale segment.
As of the end of December, the country reached a cumulative installed solar power capacity of 3.65 GW. This was enough to cover around 6% of its electricity demand.
According to Swissolar, battery deployment increased by a factor of 2.5 compared to 2020. About every third new residential PV system was combined with a home storage system. In total, installed storage capacity at the end of 2021 was 157 MWh.

American engineers at Bell Labs unveiled the first photovoltaic solar cell in 1954. Four years later, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched solar panels into space.
Today, solar panels power the James Webb Space Telescope, which offered the world the most detailed look into the most remote reaches of the universe to date.
NASA launched the Webb Space Telescope on Christmas Day 2021. The telescope uses less power than one might think. In fact, only one kilowatt, equivalent to the power used in microwaving your lunch, is needed to power the device. NASA said Webb will stay energy efficient more than 1 million miles from Earth, reliably powered by photovoltaics.
A 20-foot fold-out solar array is attached to the main observatory of the craft. It will act as the ‘powerhouse’ for the telescope, supplying energy to all its scientific instruments, communications, and propulsion systems. The system is sized at 2 kW to account for the degradation that will occur over time due to the harsh conditions of space.
The array consists of five panels that are connected by hinges for folding into the launch vehicle, the Ariane 5 rocket. The telescope’s onboard battery was designed to only last a few hours, so the unfolding and activation of the array were considered one of the most critical early steps of the telescope’s voyage. A video of the deployment of the fold-out array can be viewed below.
 
Solar in space
The James Webb telescope is not the only NASA project that relies on photovoltaics to power its systems. Last June, Astronauts Shane Kimbrough of NASA and Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency (ESA) completed their spacewalk upgrade of the international space station, installing the iROSA roll-out solar arrays.
It cost about $100 million to install the six arrays. The arrays are expected to add more than 120kW in capacity, which will increase the station’s power generation by 20% to 30%. The solar panels that were replaced were designed for 15-year service life, but had been continually operating since December 2000. Although they were functioning well, the older arrays were showing signs of degradation, as expected. 
Last December, NASA announced it is testing solar-powered electric propulsion systems for asteroid defense. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission will employ roll-out solar arrays and a 6.9 kW gridded ion electric propulsion system to redirect Earthbound asteroids by smashing the small craft into the asteroid.
The craft is designed to propel itself at about 250 miles per hour, guided by an onboard camera and autonomous navigation software, directly into the path of the asteroid. The DART test will make contact with the Didymos system’s moonlet that is headed into orbit in September 2022.
NASA is also using two large cross-shaped PV arrays to power its Psyche mission, which will bring a craft 1.5 billion miles away from Earth to the asteroid Psyche. The mission is to explore a large, metal-rich asteroid with the remote-operated craft.
The Psyche solar array s 37.1 feet long and 24 feet wide on each side when fully deployed. The two cross-shaped arrays fold out from the craft, and represent the largest solar array deployed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said NASA. So large, in fact, that the entire craft could not be unfolded during the test at Arizona State University’s lab in Tempe. ASU has partnered with NASA on this mission, which will observe the suspected unusually high amount of metals in the thickest band of the asteroid.
On Earth, the solar array can generate about 21 kW of electricity, but far away from the sun alongside Psyche, they will only produce 2 kW, about the same energy demand as a hair dryer. Despite this low amount of energy, it will be sufficient to power the planned three-and-a-half-year journey to the asteroid, and the two years of orbiting and observation of the body.
“Even in the beginning, when we were first designing the mission in 2012, we were talking about solar electric propulsion as part of the plan. Without it, we wouldn’t have the Psyche mission,” said Arizona State University’s Lindy Elkins-Tanton, who, as principal investigator, leads the mission. “And it’s become part of the character of the mission. It takes a specialized team to calculate trajectories and orbits using solar electric propulsion.”
The launch is planned for this August, and the Psyche spacecraft may make first contact with the Psyche asteroid in 2026.

TP Saurya, a unit of India-based energy company Tata Power, has received a ‘Letter of Award’ (LoA) from the Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) to set up a 600 MW hybrid wind-solar power project in the state of Karnataka.
TP Saurya won the project through tariff-based competitive bidding followed by an e-Reverse auction.
The project is scheduled for commissioning within 24 months after the signing of a power purchase agreement (PPA).
With this project, Tata Power’s renewable energy project portfolio has increased to 5,524 MW, including an installed operational capacity of 3,634 MW and 1,890 MW under various stages of development or construction.
The Karnataka project is the latest addition to TP Saurya’s wind-solar hybrid portfolio. The company also secured a 300 MW project from the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) last year.

Basing the numbers on clean power purchase agreement (PPA) prices reported to price tracking company LevelTen Energy, that figure marked a 36% rise in the cost of clean energy in Poland from the same period of last year.
US-headquartered LevelTen this week reported solar development hurdles such as long-winded permitting procedures and grid interconnection agreements are ensuring demand for clean electricity outstrips supply across the 21 European and North American markets it monitors.
Flemming Sørensen, the price tracker's VP for Europe, said: “There isn’t a clear end in sight to this supply and demand imbalance because its underlying causes will take months or years to resolve. Developers continue to struggle to build new solar and wind projects, which are sorely needed, due to tough permitting and interconnection challenges, and rising cost of inputs and labor.”
With Europe in particular in the grip of high inflation, those labor costs plus well-documented, pre-existing rising materials bills and supply chain hold-ups are helping drive up solar investment expense.
With more buyers of clean energy than there are solar and wind plants to meet demand, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine putting a rocket under wholesale energy prices, solar and wind developers have pushed up PPA prices 47% from April to June last year, and 16% since the first quarter, to an average €0.06607/kWh in the markets monitored by LevelTen.
Declared solar and wind prices on the LevelTen marketplace in Italy have leveled off, at €0.0515 in the last quarter but the company noted solar electricity production outstrips demand in Sicily, causing price cannibalization by driving down the wholesale power price and reducing returns to investors.
Another reason project developers can ask for higher prices is that the soaring wholesale electricity cost means they can sell their power on the general market without the need to commit to a PPA. LevelTen said half of the energy buyers and sellers it surveyed indicated developers were insisting the price set in PPAs be linked to commodity prices or their capital expenditure.
The huge number of solar plants operating in Spain has made that market an exception to the story of rising PPA levels, with LevelTen observing the market was “remarkably stable” in the second quarter.
And the company stated clean power deals continue to be popular, with the electricity to be generated by plants due to start operations next year “nearly all sold.”
