The US company said it intends to invest $500 million to develop the land for a 5 GW of cell and 3 GW of module capacity. It will make the investment through SEG ATW Solar Manufaktur Indonesia, its joint venture with ATW Investasi Selaras, an Indonesian renewable energy developer.
The project is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of 2024. It will be one of Indonesia’s largest solar cell and module factories, according to SEG.
“The country offers a supportive environment with favorable policies, taxation benefits and abundant silicon resources,” said SEG Solar CEO Jim Wood.
The Batang cell production line will supply SEG Solar’s recently announced 2 GW module factory in Houston, enabling the company to become more vertically integrated, it said in a statement. It recently reported plans to develop module manufacturing equipment with Suzhou Horad New Energy Equipment to produce 2 GW of tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar modules in Texas.

“While technology and the mounting type are also important, our approach aims to develop a model that neutralizes these impacts and isolates geography as a determinant factor of PV performance and the differences between offshore and onshore PV installations,” the group said in their report. Two different methodologies were used to find the correlation between the independent variables and the OFPV advantage: Multiple linear regression (MLR) and multivariate polynomial regression (MPR).
In analyzing temperature differences between offshore and inland sites at 20 port cities, the group found that, in almost all of the locations, the water-cooling effect resulted in lower module temperatures at OFPV sites using a steel pontoon structure. In addition, at 70% of the sites, the average irradiation value was higher for the offshore systems compared to the land-based ones. The report notes that even in locations where the offshore sites showed a relatively lower average irradiation level, only 20% of those resulted in a negative energy yield difference.
In simulating the expected offshore performance advantages, the researchers chose locations across the globe from different continents and climate zones. For each site, they used historical data on irradiation, temperature, and relative humidity from the Nasa Power database – collected from January 2008 to January 2018. “In order to calculate the energy yield advantage, we use the equivalent of 1 MWp of panels. For this, an area of about 5200 m would be needed all placed horizontally on various connected pontoons assuming that we use the 310-Wp module,” the report states.
The average energy yield difference for the 10-year period varied between 20% and -4% for the locations used. “The major finding of this study on the energy advantage between offshore and land-based PV systems is that the energy advantage is clearly site-specific. Further, we developed a meaningful regression model which quantifies a very definite correlation between a number of geographical and meteorological values and the energy (dis)advantage of deploying PV panels offshore,” the report highlighted.
The researchers determined that OFPV is not the most viable option for some locations on the globe and that while investment and installation costs will be higher for OFPV compared to land-based systems, offshore systems will not incur costs for land.
The paper concludes that “there will be some use cases where building offshore FPV might appear promising, and in such situations, having access to a geography-based regression model such as this model will help decision-makers better understand their options.”
Their findings are available in the research article “Offshore floating photovoltaics system assessment in worldwide perspective,” published in the Progress in Photovoltaics.

German renewables developer Solar Kapital recently tested a white membrane to improve bifacial solar module yield at three of its solar facilities in Greece.
Solar Kapital reported that approximately 2,500 m2 of its membranes were used at its Lagkadas solar farm. The modules were installed on single-axis trackers with a fixed inclination of 25 degrees, positioned at an average height of 1.5 m above the ground. Measurements taken from June 2022 to May 2023 revealed a weighted average increase in output of 6.4% over the year, though values varied due to radiation intensity.
The company said that the actual yield of the two inverters during the period was 1,661 kWh per kW. Considering weather conditions, a 4% lower yield is assumed, resulting in an average production yield of 1,730 kWh per kW, which the company considers remarkable for the region. Solar Kapital said that with a guaranteed feed-in tariff of €0.073 ($0.079/kWh), the membrane's payback time is less than 2.5 years.
Solar Kapital also conducted tests on the membranes at its Kilkis solar plant, which relies on dual-axis tracker technology. The measurements indicated an approximate 2.5% increase in yield for both inverters at the facility. Factoring in a feed-in tariff of €0.335/kWh and minimal labor and geotextile requirements, the company estimated the payback time of the membrane to be less than one year.
However, the payback period estimates do not consider variable costs associated with electricity generation or the potential benefits of reducing the need for grass clippings. The nature of the subsoil is also significant, as installation costs escalate on rocky ground.
Over time, the laid geotextile degrades, with Solar Kapital's engineers assuming an annual loss of around 20% in its degree of reflection due to weather effects and dust. Consequently, the additional yields of the bifacial solar modules diminish.

The 320 W panel has a power conversion efficiency of 16.02%.
“We are currently planning to raise the efficiency of the panel to over 18%,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine, noting that the module is currently being made on a pilot production line.
The panel measures 2,005 mm x 1,005 mm x 35 mm and weighs 34.5 kg. It uses an encapsulant film based on polyolefin elastomer (POE) and 3.2 mm semi-tempered glass. It can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V and operating temperatures ranging from -40 C to 85 C.
The company guarantees that the 10-year end power output will be at least 90% of the nominal output power, which decreases to 80% after 25 years.
The company's pursuit of perovskite development is driven by the potential for significantly lower costs compared to silicon products. GCL-SI already operates a 10 MW perovskite production line in Suzhou since 2019, and currently runs a 100 MW line with plans for further scaling to 1 GW.
In the solar perovskite business, the manufacturer operates through its subsidiaries Kunshan GCL Photoelectric Materials Co., Ltd. and Suzhou GCL Nano Technology Co., Ltd.

“Various photocatalysts are now known,” said Paul Kant from the Institute for Micro Process Engineering (IMVT) at KIT. “They can be used, for example, to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, or to produce climate-neutral fuels from water and carbon dioxide.”
The proposed systems mimic the photosynthesis process and use a photocatalyst to drive the required chemical reaction for the electrolysis. The photoreactors contain the photocatalyst and the materials for the chemical reaction themselves.
“The design method and base design are applicable to any sunlight-harvesting liquid, gas, or heterogeneous multi-phase photocatalytic system,” the scientists stated. “To ensure comparability with other approaches, however, the design method and the resulting photoreactor are demonstrated experimentally with the established, commercially available, and reliable potassium iron(III) oxalate photocatalytic system.”

The photoreactor is made of hundreds of parallel reaction channels, with each of them embedding a V-shaped concentrator and a tube-like cavity. The V-shaped concentrator harvests light from various incident directions and drives it into a tube-like, mirrored cavity, enclosing the reaction volume. “The photoreactor should ideally conduct incoming sunlight to the photocatalyst with little loss, regardless of the direction it is coming from or where the sun is in the sky,” said Kant.
The microstructured polymer panels are coated with aluminum for high reflectivity and, according to the German group, enable both optimal operating conditions and efficient light transport to the photocatalyst over the entire course of the day.
The researchers believe that this system configuration may lead to the manufacturing of low-cost, high-efficiency in the near future.
“Being made from three polymer parts only, all produced via established mass-manufacturing techniques, the material cost of the reactor components is estimated to be in the range of 9.4 $ m2,” they explained. “Including a catalyst worth $1 million per ton, the material cost estimate of the photoreactor system increases to roughly 22 $ m2.”
They presented the novel concept in the study “Low-cost photoreactors for highly photon/energy-efficient solar-driven synthesis,” which was recently published in Joule. The research team includes academics from the University of Toronto in Canada.
“Further optimization of the photoreactor should address the manufacturing of the key components in polymers and the consideration of real-world aspects such as aging of polymers and optical coatings, as well as challenges such as dust accumulation in the rather complicated surface of the photoreactor aperture,” they concluded.

The German Ministry Ministry for Economic Affairs (BMWK) has launched an expression of interest process to invite solar module manufacturers to set up manufacturing facilities in Germany.
The government aims to allocate investment subsidies (capex) through the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF), subject to budget availability and European Commission approval. The objective is to establish a 10 GW production capacity along the PV value chain.
Projects must meet specific criteria, including a minimum annual production capacity of 2 GW, module efficiency over 24%, and annual degradation below 0.2%.
Soldering processes are not allowed in production, and manufacturers must demonstrate a CO2 footprint below 18 grams of CO2/kWh based on service life.
The use of antimony-free solar glass is required, with lead, bismuth, and nitrogen classified as prohibited critical raw materials.
The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has intensified pressure on the German government and the EU Commission to provide more financial support for the domestic solar industry, leading some companies to consider favoring investment decisions in the United States, where both capex and opex funding are available.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/26/new-attempt-to-build-solar-cells-based-on-copper-silver-bismuth-iodide/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BANGLADESH,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 26, 2023",New attempt to build solar cells based on copper silver bismuth iodide,"An international research team has fabricated a copper silver bismuth iodide (CABI) solar cell that utilizes Cu6AgBiI10, a new CABI compound that offers high absorbance and low reflectivity.
“The construction of solar cells based on CABI is not new,” the research's corresponding author, Arif Ul Islam, told pv magazine, noting that the previous two attempts made to build this cell technology were based on CABI materials known as CuAgBiI5 and Cu2AgBiI6, which results in efficiencies of 1.01% and 2.39%, respectively. “Our work, however, represents the first attempt to build a solar cell based on Cu6AgBiI10, which is a particular kind of CABI material.”
The scientists applied a mixed solvent-based hot-casting technique to improve the surface morphology of the Cu6AgBiI10 film, which they said is intended to achieve the highest possible photovoltaic performances. They used a single-step spin coating technique, in which hot casting drops were cast onto the preheated substrates.
“The solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds,” they explained, adding that the thickness of CABI films varied between 1183 and 1506 nm. “The films were then annealed in a glovebox at 75 C for 3 minutes and then heated at different temperature (130 to 170 °C) for six minutes on the hot-plate. Then the films were allowed to naturally cool to the ambient temperature.”
The film was used as an absorber in a PV device fabricated with a substrate made of indium tin oxide (ITO) and glass, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), the absorber itself, a hole transport layer (HTL) relying on the polymer Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
The research group analyzed the optical characteristics of the cell and found it could achieve a power conversion efficiency of 0.041% and a maximum current density of 0.45 mA/cm2, at ambient conditions. “Our optical investigation revealed high absorbance and low reflectivity CABI film at 150 C,” it also stated.
“Bismuth is found abundantly in the earth’s crust, which makes it cost-effective,” Islam stressed. “Our results should be helpful in the development of environmentally-friendly Cu–Ag-Bi–I base solar cells, as well as a variety of other devices such photodetectors or LEDs.”
The solar cell architecture is presented in the paper “Enhanced surface morphology and photovoltaic properties of a new class of material Copper Silver Bismuth Iodide Solar Cell,” published in the Journal of Materials Research and Technology. The research group comprises scientists from the University of Barishal in Bangladesh and the Nagoya Institute of Technology in Japan.

Swissolar, the PV association of Switzerland, has published provisional figures on solar market development in 2022. It said that the country installed more the 1 GW of PV last year for the first time.
The statistics confirm what was reported by SolarPower Europe in its “Global Market Outlook” report, which was released at the recent Intersolar trade show in Munich, Germany.
By comparison, Switzerland deployed around 683 MW of PV in 2021. According to Swissolar, this is the third year in a row that PV demand increased by more than 40%. Around 200,000 PV systems have now been installed in Switzerland and their combined capacity is beyond 4.6 GW.
This year, Swissolar expects the PV market to grow by more than 20%.
“Thanks to a high level of motivation, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit, the solar companies have managed record growth,” said Swissolar Managing Director Matthias Egli.

The French government has decided to revoke a measure it introduced in November 2020 to retroactively modify FIT contracts signed between 2006 and 2010 for PV plants above 250 kW.
Following orders from the French Council of State on Jan. 26, the government has announced its decision to reverse the retroactive cuts in solar power tariffs. The government's action was prompted by its failure to notify the European Commission about the lower tariffs, as required, as highlighted by the Council of State.
Despite the obligation to inform Brussels about the new tariffs, the government chose not to do so due to concerns that it could jeopardize other incentive programs that were simultaneously being reviewed by the European Commission. The government feared that the sector's aid mechanisms could be invalidated if all measures were notified together.
The reversal of the measure affects 436 solar power plants. It allows owners to receive the originally agreed-upon full tariffs established in contracts signed between 2006 and 2010, which provided generous feed-in tariffs (FITs).
