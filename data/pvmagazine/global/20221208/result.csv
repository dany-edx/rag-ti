The total installed capacity of home batteries in Europe has grown from around 3 GWh in 2020 to more than 5 GWh in 2021 and beyond the 9 GWh mark this year. The top five European markets for home batteries – Germany, Italy, Austria, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland – were responsible for 88% of the installed batteries in Europe in 2021, with Germany leading the pack with a 59% share.
“In years defined by high retail electricity prices, solar and storage help to reduce electricity bills,” said Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SolarPower Europe. “It is no surprise that consumers are installing record numbers of battery powered homes every year.”
The solar industry trade association said the number of homes hosting solar batteries in Europe will likely triple to 3.5 million by 2026. In the best-case scenario, it could be nearly 40% more, with the right policy frameworks in place, it claimed. It is now calling on policymakers to present a comprehensive EU electricity storage strategy and a target of 200 GW by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/08/germany-slashes-vat-for-residential-pv-to-0/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,GERMANY",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"DECEMBER 8, 2022",Germany slashes VAT for residential PV to 0%,"From pv magazine Germany
The German parliament debates an annual tax law at the end of every year, in order to pass new rules for the 12 months ahead. The 2022 annual tax law, which the Bundestag approved last week, includes a comprehensive change in the tax treatment of PV systems for the first time.
The new rules will resolve some key problems for small PV systems and will eliminate some bureaucratic requirements. The legislative package contains two important changes for photovoltaics. The first measure will slash the VAT to 0% for residential PV systems up to 30 kW in size. The second measure will provide tax exemptions to operators of small PV systems.
The new 0% VAT rate for PV systems has been made possible by a new regulation in the European VAT Directive, and Germany is now a pioneer in its application. Formally, it is not a VAT exemption on the sale of a PV system, but the supplier or installer bills the customer for the net price, “plus 0% VAT.”
The zero rate of VAT will be applied to the supply and installation of PV systems with the necessary accessories. It will also apply to storage systems in residential buildings, public buildings, and buildings used for public utility activities. There are no limits for the size of the storage systems.
The income tax exemption will be applied to income from the operation of PV systems up to 30 kW in size for single-family homes and other buildings. In the case of multi-family homes, the size limit will be set at 15 kW per residential and commercial unit and 100 kW per multi-family home.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/08/pv-system-fires-potentially-exacerbated-by-gap-between-solar-panels-rooftops/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NORWAY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 8, 2022","PV system fires potentially exacerbated by gap between solar panels, rooftops","Rise Fire Research, an institute in Norway, has conducted a series of experiments indicating that the distance between solar modules and rooftop surfaces could be a crucial factor in PV system fires.
“We have not found any single ideal distance between the roof and the PV modules that can prevent fire propagation,” researcher Ragni Fjellgaard Mikalsen told pv magazine. “But we have seen that the gap distance is one of several parameters that affect the fire spread.”
The scientists said that wind speed and air gap size could affect the development of fires in the space between solar modules and the underlying roof structures. They also looked at how fires could affect PV systems on real, pitched rooftops in Norway. They performed 29 experiments at the institute's facility in Trondheim in 2021.
The research group identified a link between the size of the gap between a rooftop surface and the modules, and determined how big an initial fire would have to be for the blaze to spread and become larger. 
“These, and other experiments, point to that a larger gap distance decreases the flame propagation, but other parameters, like inclination, ignition source, combustible materials can also affect the fire dynamics in the air gap,” said Fjellgaard Mikalsen.
She claimed that there are no testing methods or standards that properly consider the interplay between PV modules and building surfaces.
“The test methods for building materials are not including the possibility to add PV modules, and the test methods for PV modules are not considering what building surface they should be installed on,” she said. “For building integrated PV modules, the modules need to comply with both the regulations for building materials and as an electrical installation.”
She said that the modules were tested against one of the four European test methods listed in CEN/TS 1187, but noted that these test methods are not particularly well-suited to test PV modules.
“The American test standard UL 1703 / UL 61730 includes some fire tests where the combination of roofing material and PV installation is handled,” she said. “These are based on the test for roofing materials UL 790 where the roof is exposed to an external flame.”
The scientists said that future standards for Norwegian PV installations should be harmonized on a European level, and preferably globally.
“Ideally, the test standards should consider the interactions between the building surface and the PV modules and test the systems at a sufficiently large scale to include the important details of the building surface, fixing system and PV modules,” Fjellgaard Mikalsen said. “To be able to document the fire performance of different combinations of roofing materials, fixing systems and PV modules, a structured classification scheme could be developed.
A similar study, published by the University of Edinburgh and the Technical University of Denmark, showed similar results. The scientists analyzed fire dynamics and flame spread on the substrate beneath panels. They concluded that the shorter the distance between the panels and rooftop, the higher the probability of larger and more destructive fires.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/08/regulator-could-prove-solars-nemesis/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CALIFORNIA",,"DECEMBER 8, 2022",Regulator could prove solar’s NEMesis,"On Dec. 13, 2021, CPUC issued a proposed decision (PD) on reforming the NEM 2.0 net-metering regulations instituted in 2016, by introducing NEM 3.0. The proposed decision – for consideration by the five commissioners at the regulator – came in for severe criticism from celebrities and public figures, including former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and actor Ed Norton. Professor Severin Borenstein, at the University of California’s Energy Institute, has also considered the merits of the proposed legislation.
Three negative features stood out: a discriminatory grid-access charge of $8 per kilowatt per month, an unprecedented retroactive application of the proposed new rules to NEM 1.0 and NEM 2.0 customers, and a significant drop in the electricity export compensation rate.
Those features would have crippled the economics of rooftop solar. The payback period for solar panel systems would have doubled or tripled. Solar adoption rates would have plummeted.
The proposed decision was totally at odds with the state’s net-zero goals, which include a mandate that all new homes shall have solar panels on their roofs. The premise for instituting such drastic measures was CPUC’s desire to eliminate a cost shift that supposedly penalized the poor and benefited the rich.
The proposal, however, ignored all other cost shifts that arise in the design of electricity rates. It ignored subsidies provided by the state to low-income customers. It ignored the $1.5 billion that the state spends every year on energy efficiency programs which cause usage to go down, creating another beneficial cost shift.
Under pressure from the public, a second proposed decision, released on Nov. 10, suggests removing the grid-access charge and the retroactive provision. Removing those two elements, however, does not make the second draft worthy of admiration.
The “poor-to-rich” cost-shift narrative still permeates the entire document. The sole purpose of the latest proposed replacement for NEM 2.0 is to reduce the growth in installation of rooftop solar panels. That was also the motivation behind the first PD.
The export compensation rate, paid to solar system owners for electricity they inject into the grid, drops dramatically within a few years under the latest proposed revision. Calling the reduction a “glide path” is a misnomer. Essentially, export compensation is being pushed off a cliff.
The latest proposed decision states that its provisions will ensure a nine-year payback period for solar systems. That is doubtful since that’s the current estimate, under NEM 2.0. The payback period will be even shorter for solar systems that are paired with energy storage, according to the latest suggestion drafted by CPUC. Reaping the benefits of such an association is even more doubtful, since storage is still quite expensive.
The latest PD says that all new solar customers will be placed on a new time-of-use (TOU) “electrification” rate. Compared to other TOU rates, this will feature slightly lower energy charges but will have a fixed charge of $15 per month. The non-bypassable charges will remain in effect. Thus, the typical solar customer will be paying a fixed charge of around $25 per month.
The proposed decision is hard to follow, even for trained economists, and the math it contains is even tougher to decipher. Instead of single-mindedly focusing on reducing the cost shift, CPUC should state what the impact on carbon emissions would be in three scenarios: the status quo under NEM 2.0, the first proposed decision for NEM 3.0, and the new one.
CPUC should also explain why the societal cost test – which factors in additional costs and benefits for society at large that do not directly affect the cost of energy supply – was not used. It should also explain why resilience benefits, especially for those with storage, were not considered, even though they were brought up by several parties during the decision-making process.
The import rate has an odd, unexplained spike between 9 a.m. and noon. Export compensation gets a drastic haircut. It’s doubtful that customers would understand the proposed rules. For example, various parties have reported the average export rate is $0.08/kWh when the solar output weighted average rate is closer to $0.06/kWh.
The new proposed draft says the intent is to incentivize the installation of storage with solar. In that case, the easiest path would be to double the state’s self-generation incentive for batteries. To make these investments even more attractive, a critical peak period pricing overlay should be added to the electrification rate. If customers agree to that, they are contributing to the state’s load flexibility goals and should be offered a rebate based on the size of their system. To address the fair access issue, the rebate could be doubled for low-income customers.

Sodium-sulfur batteries have long offered high potential for grid-scale stationary energy storage, due to their low cost and high theoretical energy density of both sodium and sulfur. However, they have also been seen as an inferior alternative and their widespread use has been limited by low energy capacity and short life cycles.
To overcome these limitations, the research team implemented a simple pyrolysis process and carbon-based electrodes to improve the reactivity of sulfur and the reversibility of reactions between sulfur and sodium.
“Our sodium battery has the potential to dramatically reduce costs while providing four times as much storage capacity,” said researcher Shenlong Zhao, in reference to the device's competitiveness with lithium-ion batteries. “Storage solutions that are manufactured using plentiful resources like sodium – which can be processed from seawater – also have the potential to guarantee greater energy security more broadly and allow more countries to join the shift toward decarbonization.”
The scientists built the battery with an integrated dual active sites cathode, which was made with sulfur-doped graphene frameworks supporting atomically dispersed molybdenum disulfide (2H-MoS2) and molybdenum (Mo1). The researchers said the battery displayed “unprecedented cyclic stability” and rate performance, with a high initial capacity and a low-capacity decay rate of 0.05% per cycle over 1,000 cycles at room temperature. It had an initial capacity of 1,017 mAh g−1 and retained a high capacity of 505 mAh g−1 after 1,000 cycles at 0.1 A g−1.
The academics said they have successfully fabricated and tested the lab-scale batteries in the University of Sydney’s chemical engineering facility. They plan to improve and commercialize the cells.
They described the new battery tech in “Atomically Dispersed Dual-Site Cathode with a Record High Sulfur Mass Loading for High-Performance Room-Temperature Sodium–Sulfur Batteries,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials. The group includes scientists from Chongqing University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the University of Science and Technology in China, as well as from the University of Adelaide, the University of Wollongong, and the University of Sydney in Australia.

The vertical installation is part of a 300 kW PV system that the company has deployed at the site for self-consumption, with the support of Spanish installer Becquel. The project consists of a rooftop PV system with 660 solar modules and a vertical array featuring 65 panels.
“In addition to generating energy, this vertical installation reduces the energy consumption of the tubs, as it isolates them from direct contact with the sun,” a Becquel spokesperson told pv magazine. “It is a triple effect, as it achieves energy generation, insulation from the sun and reduction of energy consumption, with the electricity being required to keep cold the content of the tubs.”
Becquel used 455 W Canadian Solar panels in the facility. The project will be able to generate around 429,960 kWh per year for the winery. It is expected to cover 35% of the company's energy needs.

“Although ultrasonic technology has been recognized as an effective new method for increasing the efficiency of heat transfer processes, research on the use of ultrasonic waves to increase the cooling performance of the PV systems is very rare,” researcher Amin Shahsavar told pv magazine. “However, so far no studies have been conducted on the use of cold vapor induced by high-frequency ultrasonic waves for cooling the cold side of TEGs in a PV-TEG hybrid system.”
Ultrasonic energy is generally used in other applications as a cooling method by spraying and atomizing a cold liquid to hot surfaces to reduce their temperature.
“High-frequency ultrasonic waves can produce cold steam and can atomize water droplets, which have a high specific surface area for the heat transfer process,” the scientists explained.
The proposed system can generate cold steam by ultrasonic piezoelectrics in a simple batch system. The generated cold steam is in contact with the cold side of the TEGs that are connected to the backside of a solar module.
They academics the system with a 10 W solar panel measuring 36 cm × 27 cm × 10 cm, which was provided by Taiwanese semiconductor maker ACDC Taiwan. They used a solar simulator consisting of a chamber with a wooden base and a roof, with the sidewalls being covered with aluminum foil sheets.
They also equipped the chamber with a cubic glass enclosure with a size of 35 cm × 25 cm × 10 cm and five ultrasonic piezoelectrics (PZTs). They used 12 thermoelectric generators based on bismuth telluride, each with dimensions of 40 mm × 40 mm × 4 mm and maximum voltages 4 V and and 24.4 A of current. They also used a laser thermometer to measure the module operating temperature and d a digital thermometer with two thermocouples to measure the inlet and outlet temperatures of the working fluid. 
The Iranian group applied several working fluids, including water-based nanofluid containing silicon carbide (SiC),  a mixture of ethanol and water with different volume fractions of ethanol, and a mixture of ethanol and water with SiC nanofluid.
“Comparing the effect of working fluids proved that SiC nanofluid, even at very low concentrations, due to its high conductivity, had a more significant effect than water in reducing the temperature of the photovoltaic module and increasing its electrical efficiency,” it explained.
They found that the maximum values of power yield and power conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic module were achieved with a mixture of ethanol and water with SiC nanofluid.
They introduced the cooling tech in “Improving the performance of photovoltaic modules using ultrasonic- thermoelectric generators,” which was recently published in Applied Thermal Energy.
“The results showed that for all working fluids and all arrangements of thermoelectric generators, the value of the coefficient of energy is higher than 1, which proves that the ultrasonic-thermoelectric generators/photovoltaic system is fully practical,” the scientists said. “Through an advanced understanding of the benefits of US-TEG/PV technology, this study forms the rationale for implementing ultrasonic cooling systems that lead to the design and analysis of a pilot project.”

Research and development is vital in the development of new technologies, yet there are many obstacles to overcome before they can move from the lab to the marketplace.
Analysts from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Joint Institute for Strategic Energy Analysis (JISEA), and US Department of Energy (DoE) analyzed case studies for the commercialization of four clean energy technologies. They looked at thin-film solar panels, wind turbines, dual-stage evaporators for refrigeration, and fuel cells for material handling equipment.
Findings across the case studies – published in a recent Frontiers in Energy Research article – revealed three components common to successful advancement to commercialization: (1) a good fit among public-private partnerships, R&D infrastructure, and the technology itself; (2) appropriate alignment of government regulations, R&D priorities, and market forces; and (3) the right timing between technology readiness and market opportunity.
“These findings can help inform clean energy investment decision-making, maximize benefits from R&D, and advance transition to a productive, low-emission future,” said Wyatt Merrill, DoE technology manager and co-author.
The thin-film solar case study focuses on First Solar, a US manufacturer that benefited from DoE solar research, and directly received DoE funding in research partnerships from the 1980s to 2000s. The researchers credit First Solar’s early success to the fact that the company addressed regulatory needs within the thin-film PV technology’s first major market and established a proven product at a price and time for a market that was ready for it.
A notable advance in the early stages of thin-film research demonstrated a record (at the time) of 15.8% cell using a cadmium chloride (CdCl2) heat treating process. First Solar co-developed a high-rate vapor transport deposition manufacturing technique to produce CdTe-based modules at a larger scale, which was an alternative to the slower, costlier close space sublimation manufacturing process.
With suitable device efficiency and scalable manufacturing procedures in place, the R&D focus shifted to testing and validation of product reliability. First Solar used testing standards, product quality certifications, and outdoor testing facilities funded by the DoE and led by Arizona State University and NREL to prove by 2003 that its modules were ready to enter the solar market.
First Solar entered the strong German solar market in the 2000s. But first, its modules needed to meet energy performance and regulatory requirements, which included electronic waste regulation and restrictions on the use of certain toxic substances like cadmium. A 2004 effort helped resolve concerns about emissions and recyclability of CdTe PV modules with independent, peer-reviewed studies.
Later in 2004, First Solar secured its first contract for its compound thin semiconductor modules in the German PV market, which was a commercial turning point for CdTe PV. In 2005, First Solar announced a module takeback and recycling program to respond to evolving EU policy directives, an effort that helped communicate First Solar’s responsiveness to regulatory issues, and they addressed public perception of risk sufficiently to access key markets.
While CdTe modules are less efficient than silicon-based panels, they cost less to manufacture and achieved the lowest price per watt from the mid-2000s until the mid-2010s. At the same time, demand for PV products in Europe outpaced supply, and First Solar was able to capitalize on its technology.
“The thin-film PV case study shows the importance of addressing regulatory needs within the technology’s first major market,” said Marie Mapes, DoE technology manager and co-author. “In addition, establishing a proven product at a price and time when the market was ready for it led to its early success.”
The key findings in the thin-film PV case study identified the successful use of three key commercialization strategies: development of technology with many commercially relevant inputs through public/private partnerships, alignment of set technology cost goals and product development that achieved them, and timing compatibility of technology readiness and market opportunity.
First Solar’s thin-film development benefited from government funding over decades, which enabled foundational materials research and consistent testing standards. What resulted was a prepared company with the right product at the right time. CdTe photovoltaics of proven reliability were a lower-cost replacement in a clean energy market with an open window of opportunity, allowing the early commercialization success of this solar technology.
The four case studies highlight how a good balance of technology, R&D, and public-private partnership – along with regulatory and market force alignment and the right timing – can lead to successful first commercialization of clean energy technologies.

The latest version of Trina Solar’s Vertex S All-Black solar module has a power output of up to 425 W and a maximum efficiency of 21.3%.
The Chinese manufacturer said single module power for the upgraded version of the series has increased by up to 30 W. This additional power has been achieved by implementing the latest 210 mm rectangular silicon wafer technology, instead of regular square-shaped cells.
The product is backed by a 25-year product and 25-year performance warranty. End power output is guaranteed to be no less than 84.8% of the nominal output power, while degradation in the first year should not exceed 2%.
Trina Solar said the Vertex S Aesthetic module is compatible with mainstream optimizers, inverters, and mounting systems available in Australia.
The module measures 1,754 mm × 1,096 mm × 30 mm and weighs in at 21 kg, It has been designed for residential applications and commercial and industrial installations. Trina Solar Asia Pacific President Todd Li said he is confident that the installer-friendly Vertex S will secure a significant share of the Australian rooftop PV market.
“We are seeing strong interest from Australian households for this product because of its performance, in terms of higher power output and efficiency,” he said, adding part of the appeal of the Vertex S Aesthetic module is its sleek look.
The Vertex S Aesthetic module appears more matte and has minimal glass reflection thanks to a double layer of anti-reflection coating (ARC). The module also has a uniform black colour due to a dedicated cell-blackening treatment.
“More and more Australian households are installing solar on their rooftops, so we make sure we offer a wide choice of module designs to complement various styles of roofs and help aesthetically-minded homeowners,” said Li. “The black color cells with ultra-fine busbars, together with a fine layout of the black frame, back-sheet, black label and string busbars, makes Vertex S All-Black visually appealing for households.”

“From about 1,000 MW last year, in 2022, we should almost double to about 2 GW,” Italia Solare President Paolo Rocco Viscontini told pv magazine at the recent Italia Solare Forum in Rome. “For 2023, a doubling from this year is very likely, and for 2024 a further doubling, so we are talking about 2 GW, 4 GW, and 8 GW.”
Industrial installations are growing at the fastest pace, followed by ground-mount solar installations.
Italian consultancy Elemens said 39% more permits were allocated in the first 10 months of this year than in the same period of 2021. Authorizations for PV installations reached 3,319 MW in the January-October period.
“There does not appear to be no obvious correlation with the simplifications, any effects of which have yet to be absorbed by the market: rather, the reasons seem to depend mainly on the pressure exerted by the large number of projects filed,” Tommaso Barbetti, a partner at Elemens, said during the Italia Solare Forum.
Elemens splits the Italian solar market into three areas: Sicily, Apulia, and the rest of the country. The first two regions have high potential and demand, while the third offers good potential. Elemens said that 39% of all projects larger than 1 kW had still not started the authorization process, a full year after the first connection request.
“The issue of connections to the grid is undoubtedly an important and critical point because the demands are very high, much higher than what the country will need,” said Viscontini.
Connection requests keep the grid busy – especially the high-voltage networks. But Italia Solare's assessment of the new government is mixed. It has proceeded with changes in the ministries, as it has created the Ministry of Environment and Energy Security (MASE) to replace the Ministry of Ecological Transition.
“We certainly think the willingness of the new MASE minister, Pichetto Fratin, to dialogue is positive,” said Viscontini. “Less good was the draft of the budget law, particularly concerning the management of extra profits for power producers, which is once again wrong and confusing.”
Connections, authorizations, building rules, and finance are needed for the industry to exploit the country's full potential. In general, analysts are asking for more clarity. Italia Solare is also demanding clear rules for agrivoltaic projects, especially when it comes to defining which projects are eligible for incentives.
“We hope that agrivoltaics can be done even without incentives, but this means facilitating approvals for plants that are not financially burdensome,” said Viscontini. “We need agrivoltaic projects that are not expensive and not complicated. Certainly, systems involving plants with particularly high structures relative to the land are more expensive and therefore need incentives.”
