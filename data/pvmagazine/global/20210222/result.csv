France's energy regulator, the CRE, has announced the results of the ninth tender for large scale PV.
According to French analyst Finergreen, the French authorities allocated 451.9 MW of PV capacity in the procurement exercise.
The first project category, including ground-mounted projects exceeding 5 MW in size, accounted for most of the allocated capacity, with 216 MW, although the French government had hoped to assign 400 MW for this plant typology. The average final price for this category was €0.05338/kWh.
In the second category, comprising ground-mounted PV installations with a capacity between 500 kW and 5 MW, the final average price was €0.06225/kWh and the total allocated capacity was 120 MW, with the CRE having sought to assign 170 MW.
In the third category, including PV projects on parking shades, with a capacity of 500 kW to 10 MW, the allocated capacity was 70 MW and the final average price €0.08096/kWh.
French independent power producer Neoen secured the largest amount of capacity, with 73.8 MW, followed by Engie, with 61.4 MW and Total Quadran, with 49.4 MW. These three companies were able to secure 40% of the total capacity.
The overall final average price of the tender was 4.7% higher than that of the eighth procurement exercise.
Finergreen's analysis notes that since the first tender, average prices have fallen by 13.7%: firstly, the prices fell by 16.4% between the first and fourth rounds, then there was a rebound in the average tariff of 10% between the fourth and the sixth rounds, then the tariff again began a new downward trend in the seventh and eighth rounds, with a drop of 10.4% compared to the average tariff of the sixth round, leaving the average tariff at a level close to that experienced during of the fourth exercise.

The company specified that it received orders for three large scale PV projects with a capacities of 120, 100 and 70 MW and that total orders have exceeded, by around 500 MW, its current module capacity.
The company also revealed that in 2020 it achieved revenue of TWD12.5 billion (US$448 million) and that its sales accounted for around 40% of the country's total solar demand for last year, which reached 1.5 GW. For 2021, in which around 2 GW of solar capacity should come online, the company expects to increase its domestic market share to 50%.
The company currently has a solar cell production capacity of 2.5 GW while its panel capacity stands at 1.1 GW. “Around 1.5 GW of cell capacity is located in Taiwan while the rest is in Vietnam and Thailand,” it told pv magazine in July. As for the modules, it has 600 MW of production capacity based in Taiwan and 500 MW in Vietnam. “We also outsource about another 200 MW of module [production capacity] from our supplier in Taiwan,” it added.
URE, which was formerly known as Neo Solar Power, became Taiwan's largest PV manufacturer through the merger with Gintech, and Solartech. The company is also active in the project development business and last year it built the country's largest solar facility–a 193 MW project near the city of Tainan.

Ali Yasir, of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), examined the role solar can play in reaching the UN sustainable development goal of universal energy access, in particular through its deployment in humanitarian and healthcare settings.
With electrification not proceeding fast enough to meet the UN ambition of universal energy access by 2030, solar could offer a fast-track solution, according to Yasir, particularly when installed with the help of innovative business models. “Off-grid renewable energy technologies represent a cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, rapidly deployable and modular tool to accelerate the pace of electrification,” said IRENA's program officer for decentralized renewable energy.
A founding partner and steering committee member of the Global Health and Energy Platform of Action convened by the World Health Organization, IRENA is also working with the African Union Commission to electrify health facilities across the continent to speed up Africa's Covid-19 response effort.
Yasir said IRENA is aiming to bring clean, affordable power to rural health facilities in Burkina Faso and a gap analysis and assessment of 50-60 such sites, to act as a blueprint for a wider roll-out, is expected to be completed next month.
The organization has also deployed solar lighting kits, water pumps, mini-grids, and grid-connected renewables to bring power to refugees, in association with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).
With IRENA estimating 90% of the world's more-than-70 million displaced persons have no access to electricity, another solution involves leasing solar home systems on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) basis to the UNHCR for use in refugee camps.
Javier Ortiz–a technical advisor for the GET.invest program backed by the EU and the governments of Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Austria–gave details of two solar-linked renewables projects where the European body was able to help local plans get off the ground.
One project to benefit from the help of GET.invest's ‘finance catalyst'–which links solar projects and companies with investors and finance–is the €36 million Haggar irrigation project in Sudan, which will pair 20 MW of solar generation capacity with 40 MWh of gravity-based energy storage.
The high-risk nature of Sudanese investment saw GET.invest tap its investor network and persuade local stakeholders to get on board with the irrigation system planned by agribusiness GLB Farm, 100km north of Khartoum. The project involves Dubai-based Sudanese investment group Haggar, Dutch renewables company Photon Energy and Swiss gravity storage business Energy Vault SA.
Rupesh Hindocha, chief executive of Nairobi-based commercial and industrial distributed solar company Premier Solar Group also pointed to the key role storage will play in driving solar adoption. “While Hagger is using gravity, we are using lithium and other players are using molten salts, and this is a defining moment for on-site generation to really scale up across sub-Saharan Africa.”
GET.invest also helped Cameroonian off-grid renewables supplier Upowa scale up the distribution of PAYG solar kits in a €14.72 million project in its domestic market, by identifying sources of finance and grant support, including a €3 million loan from the EU-funded Electrification Financing Initiative.
Ortiz warned the road to bankability for such projects is long, and can take up to two years.
In terms of challenges to off-grid solar, Rolake Rosiji, former Nigeria country manager for Nairobi-based M-Kopa, said educating people about the reliability of the technology was key. M-Kopa distributes solar products for a down payment of around 15% with customers then paying a daily fee for a year until the unit is paid for. Rosiji, treasurer of the Renewable Energy Association of Nigeria, said the company had attracted backing from the World Bank, U.K. government and Nigeria's Rural Electrification Agency.
While commercial and industrial (C&I) solar is making inroads, according to Laetitia Dubois, Africa business developer for French renewables outfit Akuo Energy, hurdles remain such as lack of access to finance and the mismatch between the 3-5-year business horizons of companies as diverse as miners and hospitality firms and the 20-25-year lifespan of solar projects.
Commercial solar businesses are pushing through administrative barriers and negotiating grid issues in Africa, said Dubois, however “to be competitive, you need to leverage your project with some depth but the banks require security mechanizations such as [a] parent-company warranty, a lot of credit, escrow accounts etc, and these are things that the C&I client are not necessarily happy to provide.”
Participants in the webinar agreed on the central role the PAYG approach plays in Africa, as well as the pivotal importance of energy storage to drive deployment of rooftop solar, geothermal, and wind solutions, especially in the C&I field.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/22/improving-algorithms-to-help-solar-project-developers-avoid-the-nimby-effect/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 22, 2021",Improving algorithms to help solar project developers avoid the NIMBY effect,"A group of scientists from the Kansas State University and Cornell University, in the United States, is proposing to improve existing approaches and tools for multi-criteria decision analysis in the development and construction of large scale PV power plants by adding socio-demographic and socio-economic criteria.
The researchers summarized in a study, published in Applied Energy, all existing geographical information system (GIS) multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methodologies and found that all of them are based exclusively on techno-economic considerations on project costs and expected growth in regional electricity demand.
In GIS-MCDA approaches, the site selection criteria are determined after a specific region is chosen for the potential construction of a solar park. The criteria are then split into exclusion criteria, including constraints or restrictive factors, and decision criteria, which the scientists describe as suitability criteria or preferences, or the ones which are optimized. “Then, by processing exclusion criteria in GIS, a feasible region is generated,” they further explained. “Following the creation of a feasibility surface, the relative importance of various suitability criteria is determined through the application of MCDA algorithms, which are then used to further classify the feasibility region into suitability tiers.”
The researchers stressed that the three most important factors that are considered in decision criteria in project planning are solar radiation, distance from the electricity network, and the slope of the land. Protected lands and legal restrictions, as well as the presence of farmland and open water and wetland, are the main factors that are taken into account for exclusion criteria.
The U.S. group identified four MCDA algorithms that are coupled with GIS and have been used alone or in combination with other algorithms in solar project planning: analytical hierarchy process (AHP), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE), and weighted linear combination (WLC).
Although these techniques have proven to be, thus far, effective in terms of economic payback and technical requirements, they have not shown the same effectiveness in avoiding the “not-in-my-backyard” (NIMBY) response from local communities, due to the lack of socio-demographic and socio-economic factors in their respective models. The NIMBY effect consists of the opposition to the locating of something considered undesirable in one's neighborhood.
The scientists stressed all recent efforts made by the scientific communities to integrate social dynamics in the modeling and concluded that there is still much to be done to understand the degree to which measuring these variables proactively could help mitigate public opposition down the line on individual projects.
The academics also explained, public opposition from communities or groups of citizens should not automatically exclude an area from consideration for renewable energy facilities. Social variables can help identify areas with expected opposition and this information, however, should not necessarily be automatically assumed to be an exclusion criterion within the GIS-MCDA framework. As for the solar project developers, they should not simply try to avoid opposition from local communities but try to better understand and engage this opposition to improve facility designs.
In future research, the research team wants to further analyze the shortcomings of the GIS-MCDA approach when used in isolation, and test the analytical tool within an interactive and responsive siting process.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/22/japans-largest-floating-pv-plant-reconstructed-after-typhoon-impact/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,FRANCE,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 22, 2021",Japan’s largest floating PV plant being reconstructed after Typhoon impact,"French floating PV specialist Ciel&Terre—known for its proprietary Hydrelio floating platforms—and Japanese electronics manufacturer Kyocera have announced that the 13.7 MW Yamakura floating PV plant in Japan is currently being reconstructed, 16 months after Typhoon Faxai destroyed a big portion of the facility.
“The Yamakura incident happened in September 2019, when one of the five strongest typhoons in 60 years (named Faxai) occurred in the Chiba area, with wind speed recorded at up to 207kmh,” Ciet&Terre said in a statement. “Due to the typhoon’s unusual strength, a part of the floating PV plant was impacted and needed to be rebuilt.”
“One floating island with a complex shape has been changed to smaller islands with a square shape, to avoid stress concentration,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The design with square shapes increased safety factors.”
The company also recalled that the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) started an investigation after the incident and said that its experts and those of Kyocera TCL Solar cooperated with the ministry in a “highly professional manner, to leave no stone unturned, and make sure underlying causes of the incident were fully understood.”
The final, root causes identified by the METI investigation, which was concluded in April 2020, were the island size and shape, the stress concentration load, and the safety factors used during construction. “The Hydrelio structure engineered by Ciel & Terre is not in question,” the French company specified. “Client investigations have been additionally done on different parts of the Hydrelio structure to confirm there was no damage from degradation over time.”
In its report, METI had concluded that the main cause of the accident was anchor failure. The floating island was held in place by 420 anchors, which connected to a total of 823 mooring lines. During the storm, seven anchors came loose on the central, southern end. After the anchors failed, the resin bolts started to collapse because the wind loads were now dissipated more unevenly. After each collapsed bolt, the loads on the adjacent ones increased, causing a chain reaction. In this way, the array was ripped into three parts. The shape of the plant also played a role, according to the ministry.
The reconstructed portion of Yamakura floating PV plant has not resumed commercial operation yet. “We will provide an update in June,” Ciel&Terre's spokesperson said, without providing further details.
*The article was amended on February 25 to reflect that the reconstruction of the plant is not fully completed, as we previously reported.

Lavo and its joint venture partner Nedstack said on Monday they had signed a memorandum of understanding with Springfield City Group (SCG) to develop an AU$20 million (US$15.7 million) hydrogen fuel cell manufacturing facility.
Lavo CEO Alan Yu said preparations for the facility, which is supported by a grant from the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre, are already underway. Construction is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2021 with a targeted timeline for completion by early 2022. Production is expected to commence later in the same year.
“We are very excited to be working with the SCG and helping deliver on its vision of a city that leads in innovation, design, entrepreneurship and, importantly, sustainability,” Yu said. “This MoU demonstrates the immense potential of the Lavo System, and we look forward to the exciting collaborations that we will undertake alongside SCG. In the meantime, we continue to work closely with our production and manufacturing partners to bring this incredible technology into homes by July 2021.”
The development will allow for the local production of Dutch company Nedstack’s polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology for Lavo and other customers across the Australasia region.
Nedstack’s PEM fuel cells are a critical component in the Lavo System, launched late last year and described by the company as the first and only commercial-ready hydrogen energy storage system in the world designed for everyday use by residential homes and businesses.
Lavo said the hydrogen battery, which was developed in conjunction with researchers at the University of New South Wales and stores 40 kWh of energy, provides a more complete, versatile and sustainable energy storage solution than any alternative currently on the market. In a statement, the company said the “technology has a storage capacity three times greater and a lifetime more than two times longer compared to market alternatives”.
Designed to be portable, the Lavo System employs canisters containing a patented metal hydride that absorbs hydrogen providing stable, long-term storage.
The Lavo System will initially be aimed at residential and commercial markets, including off-grid regional and rural properties, and telecommunication towers. Across these segments the company estimates the market for its technology exceeds AU$2 billion in Australia, expanding on a global scale to AU$40 billion.
SCG chairman Maha Sinnathamby said land for the hydrogen fuel cell manufacturing plant has been set aside in Springfield City’s 40-hectare Vicinity business park. Sinnathamby said the MoU would also allow SCG and Lavo to work together to identify other renewable energy opportunities, including the integration of Lavo technology into utility scale solar farms developed in the master-planned community.
“As our relationship grows, we look forward to exploring many more opportunities to apply Lavo’s innovative technology and expertise more broadly to deliver on our blueprint for a clean-green future,” Sinnathamby said.
Sinnathamby said SCG had adopted an eco-friendly strategy for Springfield City – where the population of 46,000 is expected to triple over the next two decades – which includes “producing more energy than we consume by 2038”. Under the strategy, at least a third of Springfield City will be set aside as ‘green space’ and residents will have widespread access to electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and a hydrogen bus network and see 100% of their power delivered through renewable sources.
“We have one chance – and the responsibility to our residents both now and into the future – to get this right and be an ongoing exemplar for others to follow,” Sinnathamby said.

Despite the Covid-19 pandemic and sharp economic contraction, the U.S. achieved a record year for renewables in 2020, adding a combined 33.6 GW of solar and wind capacity.
That’s according to the Sustainable Energy in America Factbook, an annual joint report from BloombergNEF (BNEF) and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE).
Records were also set for each individual technology in 2020. The report said solar bested its previous 2016 high with 16.5 GW built, while wind had its strongest year ever with 17.1 GW added. The report further noted that utility-scale solar+storage projects are growing in popularity across the country.
BCSE President Lisa Jacobson explained, “Global supply chain disruptions, workforce protection measures, and policy uncertainty required adaptation across the industry.”
“In a year when so much went sideways, it was a blockbuster year for renewable energy build,” added Ethan Zindler, BNEF’s head of Americas. “Decarbonization of U.S. energy accelerated in 2020, and the benefits will be felt for years to come.”
Looking at the country’s overall power mix, the report also found that renewables’ contribution to the U.S. power grid set another record in 2020, rising 11% year-over-year. Renewable energy, including hydropower, generated a fifth of U.S. power last year.

The report said natural gas remained the largest source of U.S. power generation at 41%, but its 2019-2020 growth was slower than 2018-2019. Meanwhile, coal-fired power’s contribution slipped to 19% from 45% a decade ago. The report attributed coal’s decline to weak demand, continual plant retirements, and competition for lower-carbon power sources.
The report found the pandemic and resultant economic disruption in 2020 caused a massive drop in national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Energy demand for electricity and transportation fell by 3.8% and 14.4%, respectively, supporting the 9% year-over-year decline in GHG emissions for the U.S.

The report said this fall in emissions is the most significant on record and puts the U.S. on track to meet its 2025 Paris Agreement goals, to which President Joe Biden recommitted the U.S. on his first day in office.
The report acknowledged that energy demand and emissions are expected to rebound with widespread Covid-19 vaccinations in 2021. The positive impacts of cleaner energy, however, will persist.
