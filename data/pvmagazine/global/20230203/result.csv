The Japanese company said it will also sell its fuel cell systems in the open market to promote its hydrogen fuel cell systems, in cooperation with General Motors. This will allow it to reach economies of scale. Honda said fuel cell stack costs should become comparable with diesel engines by 2030, at about one-third to half of current costs. “We have identified four core domains we will focus on during the early phase of our hydrogen business: Honda FCEV models, commercial vehicles, stationary power stations and construction machinery,” said Arata Ichinose, head of business development at Honda. The company will also collaborate with original equipment manufacturers on commercial vehicles and construction machinery in Japan and China. 
Morocco “is well positioned” to become a regional leader in the green hydrogen economy, ranking alongside the United States, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Chile as the five countries most likely to produce cost-competitive green hydrogen, wrote the Atlantic Council. North Africa has the potential to become the world's foremost producer of green hydrogen, should Europe channel significant investments. “Algeria has the largest wind energy potential on the continent – approximately 7,700 GW if fully developed – and released plans to expand renewable energy production to 15 GW by 2035, with an annual growth rate of 1 GW. Mauritania's combined solar and wind potential exceeds 500 GW if fully developed,” said the US think tank.
Air Liquide and TotalEnergies has decided to set up an equally owned joint venture to develop a network of hydrogen stations for heavy-duty vehicles on major European road corridors. “The partners aim to deploy more than 100 hydrogen stations on major European roads – in France, Benelux, and Germany – in the coming years,” said Air Liquide. The French groups said they will invest in the stations and produce hydrogen from the market. 
Alstom has announced a passenger service demonstration project for its Coradia iLint hydrogen-powered train in Canada, in partnership with the provincial government of Quebec, Chemin de fer Charlevoix, Train de Charlevoix, Harnois Énergies, and HTEC. “The province of Quebec will be the first jurisdiction in the Americas to run a train with zero direct emissions powered by green hydrogen,” said the French company. 
The French government has announced €126 million ($136.7 million) of aid for 14 territorial hydrogen ecosystems, within the call launched in 2020. A new call for projects will take place in 2023. “The objective is to continue the deployment of hydrogen ecosystems, particularly for industrial uses,” said the French government. The new call for projects will be launched after a consultation in February.
Plug Power and Johnson Matthey have announced a long-term strategic partnership to accelerate the green hydrogen economy. Johnson Matthey will become a strategic supplier of membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) components, providing a portion of Plug Power's demand for catalysts, membranes, and catalyst-coated membranes (CCM). “Plug and Johnson Matthey will co-invest in what is expected to be the largest (5 GW scaling to 10 GW over time) CCM manufacturing facility in the world,” said Plug Power. “The facility will be built in the United States and likely begin production in 2025.”

Monocrystalline silicon currently sells at an average price of CNY 217.5 ($32.30)/kg, with prices ranging from CNY 200/kg to CNY 232/kg. This is 31.02% higher that the levels registered in mid-January.
The CNMIA said that polycrystalline silicon is being priced at an average of CNY 215.2/kg, with prices ranging from CNY 198/kg to CNY 230/kg, up 31.22% from mid-January.
After China's recent new year holiday, wafer manufacturers returned to high operation rates in order to handle downstream orders. As a result, they quickly consumed all polysilicon in stock, according to the CNMIA. This contributed to a tense supply situation and higher prices.

In particular, they looked at whether DC setups could lead to lower energy losses.
“One aspect derived from the work is that we could present modeled loss-savings with DC distribution for a Nordic climate with – on average – lower irradiance,” researcher Patrik Ollas told pv magazine. “Also, the effect – and proven necessity – of PV and battery storage for achieving energy savings with DC.”
For their analysis of the daily and seasonal performance of the two topologies, the scientists used a full-year data set of load usage, PV generation, load-dependent efficiency characteristics of power electronic converters (PECs), and battery storage. They considered AC and DC configurations for a building with a south-oriented 3.6 kW solar-plus-storage installation at a tilt angle of 45 degrees. They assumed the building had space and domestic hot water heating via a ground-source heat pump.
“Individual measurements were obtained for the following appliances: ground-source heat pump, ventilation, water pumps, and PV generation,” the scientists said, noting that the annual load demand is 6,354 kWh, with PV generating 3,113 kWh. “This study was performed for a grid-tied building; a bidirectional AC/DC converter was needed for grid interaction.”
The work considered four different system topologies: AC—230 VAC with load-dependent efficiency, DC1—380 VDC with load-dependent efficiency, DC2—380 VDC with fixed converter efficiency, and DC3—380 and 20 VDC with load-dependent efficiency.
“A 20 VDC sub-voltage level was added to DC1 and DC2 to supply the smaller loads and lighting through a central DC/DC converter,” said the research team.
They found that the bidirectional converter losses significantly differ when modeled with fixed and load-dependent efficiency characteristics. They also found that the DC topology could achieve energy savings even without the inclusion of PV or battery storage.
“The losses of the grid-tied converter using a constant efficiency approach (DC2) were 34% lower than those in the case implementing load-dependent efficiency (DC1),” they said. “The system efficiency values of the respective systems (AC and DC1−3) were 95.3, 94.3, 95.8, and 93.7%, respectively.”
The group concluded that the DC setup did not present a favorable option in terms of loss reduction without the inclusion of a PV and battery system.
“In a more scientific context, the erroneous of using constant efficiencies for both the battery and power electronic converter was highlighted,” Ollas concluded. “Also, the most significant savings were obtained when PV power was fed to the loads directly or via the battery storage. I acknowledge that DC distribution in buildings is a niche application and is caught in a Catch-22 situation regarding supply of products and demand. However, some particular cases could be interesting for this, for example internal DC grids with PV, battery and EV coupling and office buildings with a good correlation between PV and load demand.”
The researchers presented their findings in “Energy Loss Savings Using Direct Current Distribution in a Residential Building with Solar Photovoltaic and Battery Storage,” which was recently published in Energies.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/03/reflective-membrane-to-increase-albedo-power-yield-in-bifacial-pv-projects/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 3, 2023","Reflective membrane to increase albedo, power yield in bifacial PV projects","Germany-based company Solmax Geosynthetics GmbH, which supplies “geosynthetic drainage geocomposites” has developed a material that reportedly increases the albedo of the surface below a PV power plant by around 70%, allowing more light to reach the rear side of bifacial modules. The material was initially designed for environmental protection by containing chemicals and hazardous waste.
“The increased albedo results in additional irradiance reaching the back of the module,” the company's value engineer EMEA, Douglas Sutherland, told pv magazine. “The amount of irradiance will depend on the geometric characteristics of the plant.”
Called Geolux, the new product consists of a reflective geomembrane made of polyethylene resins and coated with a thin white polyethylene layer that reflects ultraviolet (UV) rays. According to the manufacturer, the material is inert and will not cause any chemical reaction with the ground.
“Geolux can improve the energy yield between 5 to 20% which means an equivalent levelized cost of energy (LCOE) reduction of around 2% to 5%,” Sutherland claims. “In the end, the main limiter for the extra energy benefit is the AC capacity. The question is now whether it is convenient or not to modify the AC capacity. This must be addressed by performing a trade-off between the extra energy generated and the costs associated with the AC capacity increase.”
According to Sutherland, developers could evaluate the impact of the new product at the early stages of project development using the albedo-app function in the PVradar software. “Design parameters such as the AC capacity can be optimized to ensure that the PV plant owners get the most out of the albedo enhancement,” the manufacturer said.
At least two persons are needed to install the membrane and a sharp blade such as a Stanley knife is needed to cut it. Gripple pins are used to ensure the material is held firmly in place.
In terms of total project costs, the new product would mean $0.024/W of additional Capex. “Using our experience on a 500 MW project in the Middle East, accounting for recent inflation, it would cost approximately $12 million for the entire project,” Sutherland said. “It was $8 million two years ago and hopefully prices will drop again in the future.”
Sutherland further notes that the material also prevents weed growth beneath the modules, offering significant O&M savings.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/03/romania-allocates-666-million-for-solar-rebates/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROMANIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 3, 2023",Romania allocates $666 million for solar rebates,"Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Ciucă says the government will allocate RON 3 billion ($666.2 million) this year for the Casa Verde Fotovoltaice (green PV home) scheme, in order to support residential solar installations under the national net-metering regime.
The program provides rebates for installations larger than 3 kW in size, which cover up to 90% of the array costs, provided that the grant does not exceed RON 20,000 for conventional projects and RON 25,000 for projects in isolated areas.
The Romanian authorities say that the new budget will enable the deployment of more than 150,000 PV systems. The government claims this ambitious target could be reached with new rules to simplify the installation of rooftop arrays.
“Homeowners will have just to show an identity document, proof that the beneficiary has no debts to the state or local authorities, and a grid-connection permit,” said Ciucă.
Romania’s Environment Fund Administration (AFM), the state agency for environmental protection, will likely approve the new budget in mid-February and launch a call to select interested homeowners in March. In 2022, the Ministry of Environment allocated RON 280 million for the rebate program.
Romania's net-metering regulations, which apply to all systems up to 100 kW in size, include fiscal incentives for owners of PV systems with capacities of up to 27 kW. Under that scheme, owners of renewable energy systems are allowed to sell surplus power to the country’s four power distributors – Enel, CEZ, Eon and Electrica – at rates set by the energy regulator, depending on the distributor.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Romania had 1,396 MW of solar installed at the end of 2021.

This limit has been blocking land allocations for ground-mounted PV for two years now.
“Until now, there has been a limit of 2,000 hectares imposed by the national zoning committee,” Eitan Parnass, the director of the Green Energy Association of Israel, told pv magazine.
The area limit is equivalent to about 2 GW of ground-mounted PV capacity. It applies to all utility-scale solar installations.
“It had already been exhausted when introduced and was a way for the national zoning committee to freeze land development,” Parnass said.
Now, this limit is supposed to fall. Hearings are now taking place and Parnass expects a final decision in March.
Back in September, the Israeli parliament approved exemptions for floating PV projects, for which there is 2 GW to 3 GW of potential, especially on water reservoirs. Zoning plans are not needed to build them – just a building permit. Projects up to 16 MW in size are now also exempt from this, along with rooftop systems up to 700 kW in size.
“Today, Israel generates 10% of its electricity from renewable energy,” said Parnass.
The country mainly has PV at its disposal, with around 5 GW already installed. The renewables target is 20% of generation by 2025 and 30% by 2030. Extrapolated from today's situation, this corresponds to about 17 GW of solar generation.

DNV, a Norway-based energy consultancy and ship classification society, has acquired Australian solar forecasting specialist Solcast. The Sydney-based company says the deal will allow it to expand its digital and data-driven services.
Solcast uses global weather satellite imagery, machine learning, and historical and live data on solar irradiance to produce more than 600 million new forecasts per hour, while providing real-time access via an application programming interface (API). Its forecasting system and data set is used by solar power producers, utilities, and grid operators to determine their solar resource availability at any given time.
Solcast Chief Executive Officer James Luffman said DNV’s acquisition of the company will allow it to improve its forecasting models and unlock additional value for its customers.
“DNV is investing in Solcast and providing expertise and other resources,” he said. “The result is a huge boost to our effectiveness and impact. This partnership will bring the world's leading solar irradiance and forecasting API to an even larger global audience, whilst maintaining the same level of service that our customers expect.”
Remi Eriksen, DNV group president and chief executive officer, said digital products like those provided by Solcast are key to unlocking the potential of solar.
“Solar forecasting will enable the renewable energy market to grow and accelerate the global transformation to a clean energy future,” he said.
DNV’s Energy Transition Outlook (ETO) forecasts that by 2050 global electricity production will more than double and 30% of all electricity will be provided by solar.
“Our ETO forecasts solar PV and wind are already the cheapest forms of electricity in most locations and by 2050 they will grow 20-fold and 10-fold,” Eriksen said. “Digitalization is an important enabler of the energy industry and a key component to scaling solar to the levels needed for a greener energy future.”
The acquisition will take effect immediately, although Solcast, which already has offices in Sydney, Asia, Europe and the Americas, will continue to operate under its current name. The company’s existing management and staff will remain in Australia and there are no immediate changes planned for customers and partners.

They hold the promise of more than 10-hour duration storage, high recyclability, and 25 years or more lifespan. However, these batteries suffer from comparatively low energy densities as well as complex thermal issues, which are important to understand in order to achieve their wide application and facilitate the design of next-generation VRFBs with high-power density.
To help understand how to operate VRFB systems efficiently and stably at high temperatures, scientists at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in China have composed a review in which they summarized the thermal issues of VRFBs reported in the literature to date and existing thermal management methods.
Complex thermal issues caused by excessive heat generation during high-rate operations and various heat transfer behaviors in diverse climates dramatically affect the efficiency and stability of VRFBs.
Therefore, according to the review, the operating temperature should be maintained in the range of 10 C to 40 C to ensure VRFBs with high efficiency, weak side reactions, high electrolyte stability, and low crossover.
“The thermal management system of VRFB can maintain the electrolyte temperature in the range of 10 C to 40 C in most climates,” researcher Ren Jiayou told pv magazine. “However, in extreme low temperature climates below -30 C, the thermal management system cannot operate stably.”
To ensure the electrolyte stability, it is important to predict the operating temperature of a VRFB system by cost-effective and efficient thermal models. These include two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and lumped models, as summarized in the research paper, noting that in the future, a combination of these approaches could enhance the simulation accuracy and calculation speed simultaneously.
Furthermore, existing thermal management methods are analyzed. Here, employing titanium heat exchangers with anti-corrosive properties to adjust the temperature of electrolytes is recommended as an efficient way to maintain the operating temperature of VRFB systems.
The paper takes the example of a 15 MW/60 MWh VRFB system applied in the Minami-Hayakita substation, Japan. In this project, the heat transfer through pipes plays the main role.
Specifically, when the temperature of electrolytes is higher than the upper limit of the safety threshold, the intake dapper and outlets of a VRFB stack will be opened, allowing the forced air flowing through the heat exchanger to carry the heat to the outside. When the electrolyte temperature is lower than the upper limit of the safety temperature threshold, the intake dampers and outlets will be closed.
In addition to that, with the range of ambient temperature at -10 C to 25 C, the room temperature could be maintained through a passive method, using the heat generation of VRFBs. Based on these two temperature control modes, the electrolyte temperature is maintained in the range of 30 C to 40 C.
Finally, the review highlights the remaining challenges to enhance the efficiency and stability of VRFBs under harsh thermal conditions. The paper, “Thermal issues of vanadium redox flow batteries,”was recently published in International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/03/big-wafer-benefits-extend-to-n-type-says-trina-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"FEBRUARY 3, 2023","Big wafer benefits extend to n-type, says Trina Solar","Going back as far as 2018, PV manufacturers began to explore wafer formats larger than the standard 156 mm as a route to optimizing production and lowering project costs. This brought about a big jump in module power ratings, but left behind uncertainty as to the optimal design. Today the market is split between two sizes, 182 mm and 210 mm.
Most major module producers have already chosen one or the other, and both formats will likely be widely available for the next few years at least. Promoters of both formats have claimed advantages in performance, durability, ease of installation, and other areas. For now it is not clear whether one or the other will pull away in terms of market share, though analysts including TrendForce expect the larger 210mm products gradually increase their share, representing more than 70% of the market by 2026.
Alongside this shift, in 2023 manufacturers are also moving from p-type to n-type cell designs, with tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells expected to take a sizeable chunk of the market away from the p-type passivated emitter rear cell (PERC) designs that currently dominate. Trina Solar emerged as an early backer of the 210 mm format, and is also working on converting most of its production capacity to make TOPCon products.
In a new whitepaper, Trina demonstrates that benefits it had previously shown for the 210mm format in p-type products also broadly apply to TOPCon modules. Data from a demonstration project in China shows that n-type products achieve a higher energy yield, while calculations for projects in Latin America and the Middle East show that the 210mm cell promises lower project costs compared to n-type modules using the 182 mm cell size.
Trina says it brought its n-type demonstration project online in 2016, a 5 MW installation in China’s Jiangsu province. N-type modules at the site have consistently outperformed p-type modules installed for comparison, with annual data showing the n-type products generated 3.79% more energy per kilowatt-peak in 2020, and 3.12% more in 2021.
The paper also demonstrates how Trina’s 210mm, TOPCon products add up to savings in project cost. Taking a distributed project located in Dubai as an example, Trina presents calculations showing that the 210mm modules reach the same capacity of 4 MW (ac) with fewer strings, fewer modules and fewer tracker units. This adds up to a 2.84% reduction in balance-of-system costs compared to a 182 mm n-type module. Trina also references a 100 MW project in Brazil, where it’s modules pencil out to a 2.44% reduction in project investment cost, and a 2.97% reduction in levelized cost of electricity.

Representatives of 13 European PV equipment makers, mostly from Germany, met with US solar manufacturers in a day-long conference and networking event this week in Washington, DC. VDMA Photovoltaic Equipment, a section of the VDMA trade group representing the machinery and equipment manufacturing industry in Germany and Europe, organized the event in cooperation with US institutions.
The meeting was designed “to matchmake between EU equipment suppliers and PV manufacturers expanding in the US,” said Michael Parr, executive director of the Ultra-Low Carbon Solar Alliance, an event co-sponsor.
Parr told the international gathering that with the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the United States is incentivizing, for the first time, both PV manufacturing and deployment, over “a clear 10-year runway.”
The US market opportunity for PV equipment manufacturers is $1 billion to 1.5 billion through 2030 for capital equipment alone, said Lawrence Heath, a consultant with McKinsey & Company. That projection is based on an assumption that the U.S. would add 50 GW of PV manufacturing capacity by 2030, he said.

Enphase Energy, known for its microinverters, has announced a successful demonstration of its first bidirectional EV charger, which enables vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) use.
The charger will work in conjunction with the Enphase Energy System, which includes IQ microinverters, the IQ Gateway and system controller. These are all managed by the Enphase app, where homeowners can see the flow of energy and see the level of charge of the EV battery.
By leveraging the power of the microinverter to convert DC power of the car to AC  power of the home, the bidirectional charger connects to EV, and both charges and discharges the car battery. The IQ microinverter converts DC power of the car to AC power of the home.
The Enphase bidirectional charger can be used in three ways:
The bidirectional charger requires 240 V AC, and it can connect directly to the grid or through IQ System Controller. Enphase cautions, however, that when connected directly to the grid, some V2H features are disabled. The company says that its EV charger is expected to work with electric vehicles that support stands such as CCS (combined charging system) and the Japanese charging standard, CHAdeMO.  At present, separate demonstration prototypes are made for CCS and CHAdeMO. It supports 200 VDC to 1000 VDC for EV batteries.
Enphase is working with EV manufacturers to bring this revolutionary technology to market. A time frame for release has not been announced.
