Built Robotics has launched the RPD 35, a fully autonomous robotic pile driver that integrates survey data, pile distribution, pile driving, and inspection. The company claims it is the world's first and can deploy utility-scale solar foundations up to five times faster than standard installation methods.
Built Robotics says the RPD 35 can install an estimated 300 piles per day with a two-person crew, a notable improvement in efficiency compared to the 100 units typically installed per day by a conventional team.
The RPD 35 adds four components to a standard excavator, which work together to facilitate the autonomous pile driving process. Steel arms extend from both sides of the excavator, supporting two baskets that collectively hold close to 200 piles. A custom-designed hammer assembly, located at the end of the excavator's arm, drives the piles into the ground, impacting piles up to 500 times per minute with 4,000 pounds of force per foot. On average, the unit can place a single pile in 73 seconds.
The Exosystem (CPU) manages the entire operation, driving piles with sub-centimeter accuracy. The liquid-cooled Intel Xeon computer processor and Nvidia graphic processing units power the Exosystem vision system.
The computer's design features shock and vibration resistance, as well as robust protection from water and dust ingress, despite being installed on the outside of the excavator and exposed to potentially harsh construction site conditions. Built Robotics’ website shows that the Exosystem computer is compatible with most mid-sized late-model excavators ranging from 15 to 50 tons.
The company says it has participated in more than 2 GW of solar installations since 2018. The first RPD 35 units are scheduled for deployment in the fourth quarter of 2023.

The consultation was opened on April 17 and is open for 30 days thereafter.  Members of the public are invited to submit written comments or input within the deadline.
The government is proposing to exempt newly built or expansion solar-plus-storage projects in “low” or “medium” environmental sensitivity areas from environmental approval during the permitting process. It has developed the National Web Based Environmental Screening Tool to identify environmental sensitivities of geographical locations or sites. This tool classifies sites’ environmental sensitivities as “very high,” “high,” “medium,” or “low.” The environmental themes considered are plant species, animal species, terrestrial biodiversity, aquatic biodiversity, and agriculture.
Subject to sensitivity verification, the exempted solar-plus-storage projects in South Africa must comply with a site-specific environmental management program and be registered with the competent authority before development or expansion.
“The intention of the proposed exclusions is aimed at improving the efficiency of the environmental assessment process,” the South African Ministry said in a statement. “In addition, these exclusions intend to simplify the deployment of solar PV and battery storage facilities, to expedite the generation of electricity from renewable energy resources, facilitate the distribution of this generation capacity and contribute to addressing the existing electricity shortages currently being experienced by the country.”
South Africa has been rolling out various measures to promote renewables and address its severe load-shedding problems. It introduced a rebate scheme for rooftop PV earlier this year to promote renewables and address its severe load-shedding problems, for example.

NSG is leading a consortium formed by Japanese oil company Eneos, East Japan Railway Company, and Japanese architectural firm YKK AP. The consortium may eventually adopt the solar window solution for its own projects.
“These windows are capable of highly efficient power generation using ultraviolet and infrared rays as energy sources, while maintaining the same level of transparency as ordinary windows and offering excellent heat shielding and heat insulation properties,” the company said in a statement.
The UE Power window has a transparent photovoltaic coating that absorbs non-visible wavelengths, collects and transmits electricity via an onboard system within the window frame, and transfers generated energy to a battery, boosting building energy efficiency.
The window can take technical data points, such as wind speed, light exposure, and temperature from the site. The data can be used to integrate with building system controls to optimize power utilization.
NSG and Eneos previously quantitatively evaluated the solar windows outdoors at NSG's Chiba Plant for one year. The testing period for the windows at Takanawa Gateway Station will be two months.
Ubiquitous Energy claims that its patented transparent PV glass coating produces energy without altering the appearance of traditional windows. The UE Power windows could offset up to 10% of global carbon emissions and significantly reduce the 40% of emissions sourced from buildings, according to the company.
*The article was updated on May 2 to reflect that Ubiquitous Energy is an independent company and not a unit of NSG, as we previously reported.

The Mauritian authorities have invited national and international developers to submit paper project proposals for the design, supply, installation, testing, commissioning, and operation of a 10 MW solar plant by June 9. Electronic bids will not be accepted.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Mauritius had 110 MW of installed capacity by the end of 2022. The nation did not install any new capacity last year, according to IRENA.
In March 2022, the Central Electricity Board (CEB) of Mauritius issued two different tenders for the deployment of 140 MW of solar-plus-storage capacity. The government of Mauritius has also been supporting distributed solar through net metering and rebate schemes.
The energy mix of the Indian Ocean island nation is dominated by oil and coal. Renewables account for almost 10% of the country’s final energy consumption, but this share has been gradually decreasing over the past 20 years, according to the International Energy Agency. In 2020, the country generated 146 GWh of solar power, 18 GWh of wind, and 116 GWh of hydropower, in comparison to 1,138 GWh of coal and 1,057 GWh of oil.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/27/how-green-is-the-uk-government/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED KINGDOM",,"APRIL 27, 2023",How green is the UK government?,"With the country having had three prime ministers in three months last year, it should perhaps come as little surprise to discover the last big environmental policy package – the Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution – dates back to Boris Johnson.
That policy announcement, from November 2020, included pledges to back “greener buildings” and to “accelerate the shift to zero-emission vehicles” and “drive the growth of low-carbon hydrogen” – our italics.
References to solar power were conspicuous by their absence so how do things stand for UK photovoltaics?
The planning for solar farms in the UK is handled at two distinct levels.
Any inland development that will have a generation capacity of more that 50 MW – and double that for anything on water – will be classed a nationally significant infrastructure project, for which a development consent order must be sought from the secretary of state for energy.
For smaller solar sites, the planning process will be handled by the local planning office. Obviously, when dealing with planning at a local level, residents will be allowed a say and they are none too keen on having panels in the fields around their homes. That’s not conjecture, it is borne out by the fact 27 solar farm planning applications were rejected in England, Scotland, and Wales between 2021 and 2022.
Some 19 of those rejections came in Conservative Party-controlled local authority areas. Labour areas rejected four solar applications, Scottish National Party regions three, and Liberal Democrat councils one.
Former PM Liz Truss was said to be preparing a crackdown on solar farms during her premiership but as her term in office wasn’t long enough to fill out a planning form, nothing came of that.
The solar feed-in tariff (FIT) was launched in 2010 and incentivized customers to have renewable energy generation systems fitted in their homes with the option of selling power back into the grid.
While the generosity of FIT payments may sound like a great idea, it nearly killed the UK solar industry before it got started. The initial price companies had to pay for a kilowatt-hour of electricity via the scheme was as much as £0.50 ($0.62) – which is almost £0.20 more than customers are paying for grid electricity right now, during a cost-of-living crisis exacerbated by raised energy costs. The FIT scheme simply wasn’t sustainable.
Those high payments also led to cowboy solar companies popping up and selling unsuspecting customers below-par equipment with the promise of earning thousands of pounds per month.
The FIT rates were eventually scrapped in 2019 but some households signed up for 20-year deals and are still getting paid.
Smart Energy Guarantees (SEGs) were the next big idea.
Under the SEG scheme, energy companies are legally obliged to offer customers a price for any excess energy they wish to sell into the grid – but the companies are the ones that set the price. Consequently, some energy providers offer a derisory amount for that power, some as low as £0.01p/kWh.
The SEG scheme is starting to gain support from green energy providers such as Octopus, but even then, the renewables utility only pays £0.15/kWh while charging £0.34 – so customers are better off storing their excess energy rather than selling it.
The only other initiative the UK government is currently running is the ECO4 program. The fourth iteration of the policy, ECO4 offers grants to residents in receipt of benefit payments – and potentially to others under the local authority-administered LA Flex part of the scheme – to help them install or improve everything from home insulation to solar panels.
While admirable in its aim, the program’s extent is limited and the ECO4 comes across as a somewhat toothless policy which does no more than pay lip service to a properly-funded, wide-ranging green homes drive.
When David Cameron, in 2013, pledged his Conservative government would cut the “green crap” from energy bills, the messaging looked bleak for UK renewables and Ed Matthews, director of campaigns at climate thinktank E3G, said, “the decision to cut energy efficiency funding in 2013 was the single most damaging energy policy decision that any government has taken in UK history.” Matthews described the move as a “staggering failure of leadership.”
That policy decision appears to have set the tone for the last decade – despite numerous green promises and policies.
Covid, Brexit, Ukraine, and Truss-onomics have all taken their toll on the UK economy and, when that happens, the first thing to be jettisoned by short-sighted policy makers is invariably ecologically-beneficial investment.
The future looks a bit shaky too.
Rather than investing in solar, the government is backing nuclear, opening a new coal mine, and even threatened to lift a ban on fracking during Truss’ cameo at Number Ten.
On the opposition benches, Labour has promised to ban fracking, pledged to build “enough solar panels to cover 22,000 football pitches” – that’s 2.4 million at the last count – and introduce a windfall tax on energy companies. That’s easy to say when you’re in opposition, however, so we’ll have to wait and see.
The Lib Dems and the Greens are much more focused on the planet, with the Liberals promising to make the UK the global tidal power leader and to generate 80% of the UK’s electricity from renewables this decade.
The Green Party wants to invest in enough wind power to make it account for 70% of UK electricity by 2030 – with solar, geothermal, tidal, hydro, and other renewables providing the rest. It also wants to ban new nuclear power stations and fracking for gas and oil as well as halting fossil fuel industry tax breaks and subsidies.
The Lib Dems and the Greens, though, are a long way from getting enough votes to put their plans into action on the national stage so it is to be hoped their representatives can start a green revolution from local level.
One thing is for sure: we can’t carry on as we are and the politicians really need to start taking the environment seriously.

“The HTMs were systemized and developed in the research group of Prof. Vytautas Getautis at the Kaunas University of Technology,” researcher Ilona Oja Acik told pv magazine.
“Sb2S3 is the promising candidate for the photovoltaic community owing to the earth-abundant and environmentally friendly constituent elements alongside appropriate optoelectronic properties such as a desirable band gap of around 1.7 eV, large absorption coefficient (around 105 cm–1) and long-term stability,” the scientists explained, noting that the highest efficiency for such PV devices now stands at 8%. “The overall efficiencies are rather limited by the deficiencies in open circuit voltage (VOC) that are attributed to the self-trapping of carriers due to lattice deformation and/or to the intrinsic defects, which sets the maximum attainable VOC to 0.8 V.”
The research group used the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) method to build a cell with an active area of 7.06 mm2. The device is based on a substrate made of glass and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), titanium oxide (TiO2) electron transport layer (ETL), an Sb2S3 absorber, the fluorene-based hole transport materials (HTMs) with terminating thiophene units, and gold (Au) metal contacts.
“Sb2S3 solar cells with new HTMs are fabricated in the standard superstrate configuration wherein ETL and absorber are deposited by USP while HTMs are spin coated followed by the thermal evaporation of Au,” they explained. “The as-deposited Sb2S3 films were annealed at around 250–260 C for 5 min under nitrogen.”
The champion device built has a power conversion efficiency of 4.94%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.68 V, a short-circuit current of 13.7 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 0.53. This cell uses fluorene-based molecules known as V1385. The researchers said this could ensure the plausible fabrication of Sb2S3 solar cells with efficiencies close to 5% at a much lower cost.
By comparison, Sb2S3 solar cells built with conventional hole transporting layers (HTL) made of the polymer Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) have reached efficiencies of up to 4.7% to date at the research level.
“However, they have exhibited lower transparency (26%) owing to parasitic absorption losses in P3HT,” the academics said. “Novel cost-effective and transparent fluorene-based thiophene-terminated hole transport materials are demonstrated, for the first time, in semitransparent Sb2S3 solar cells exhibiting a power conversion efficiency of 4.5% ot 4.9% and an average visible transmittance of 30% to 33% (without the metal) in the 400 nm to 800 nm range.”
They presented the solar cell in “4.9% Efficient Sb2S3 Solar Cells from Semitransparent Absorbers with Fluorene-Based Thiophene-Terminated Hole Conductors,” which was recently published in ACS Publications.

Moroccan state-owned phosphate mining company OCP Group has announced the construction of four solar power plants at two of its four mining sites in Morocco.
The company said it will build two solar farms with capacities of 22 MW and 45 MW at its site in Benguerir and two facilities with capacities of 30 MW and 105 MW in Khouribga. These two sites are home to the largest phosphate reserves in Morocco and the country alone concentrates around 70% of the world's reserves discovered to date.
The solar facilities will have a combined capacity of 202 MW and will all rely on 540 W mono-PERC modules mounted on solar trackers. The plants will power the sites' operations. The commissioning of the four power plants is scheduled for the first quarter of 2024.
“Construction should start by the end of April, as the building permit had already been granted in the fourth quarter of 2022,” a spokesperson from OCP Group told pv magazine France.
The company secured €100 million ($110.5 million) of financing from International Finance Corp. (IFC) for the projects.
“The solar power plants will provide a cost-effective source of energy, contributing to the overall competitiveness of the OCP Group,” the company said in a statement. “We plan to meet 100% of our electricity needs with wind, solar and cogeneration energy by 2027.”
The project is part of the MAD 130 billion (€11.7 billion) investment program launched by OCP at the end of 2022 to increase its production capacity from 12 to 20 million tonnes by 2027.
Under the Mining Code, the phosphate industry is one of the most polluting sectors in the world, along with other extraction activities. Mining alone accounts for more than 6% of global emissions. The OCP group did not wish to specify the part of the consumption of the activities (nor the nature of the activities) which will be covered by solar energy.

The “OffsH2ore” project aims to define a technically and economically optimized design for an integrated offshore hydrogen production plant using proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis, including the transport of the compressed hydrogen gas to land.
The power supply for the electrolysis comes from an offshore wind farm directly connected to a 500 MW electrolysis platform. The platform can produce up to 50,000 tons of green hydrogen per year. Fresh water for the PEM electrolyser is obtained by desalinating seawater using residual heat from electrolysis.
The produced hydrogen is purified and dried, compressed to 500 bar, and transferred to a transport vessel that can carry up to 400 tons of hydrogen from the platform to the mainland. This concept is independent of the hydrogen transport pipeline and offers flexibility in the choice of location.
“The results show that the production of hydrogen directly in the sea with a PEM electrolyzer is technically and economically feasible,” explained the scientists.
The project was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection.
“With the concept presented by the consortium, rapid and large-scale implementation is realistic,” said the researchers.
The concept guarantees the production of hydrogen without territorial competition.
“Offshore hydrogen production offers the opportunity to cover the entire value chain at the national level while decoupling the expansion of offshore wind energy and the expansion of the grid,” said Marius Holst, the project coordinator.
To determine the costs of hydrogen production, the first step was to determine the cost-optimal capacity of the offshore wind farm based on the electrolysis capacity of 500 MW. The minimum hydrogen production costs result from a wind power of 602 MW. In this case, they amount to 5.92 EUR/kg with just under 5,000 full charge hours of electrolysis.

Hydrogen production costs increase and full charge hours decrease with lower wind capacity. For example, a wind farm with a capacity of 490 MW results in hydrogen production costs of €6.37 ($7.04)/kg and full load hours of around 4,225 h/a. As a result of the lower wind capacity, the 500 MW electrolysis is significantly oversized and can no longer operate at a nominal load.
The consortium that worked on the project included Fraunhofer ISE, PNE AG as project coordinator, SILICA Verfahrenstechnik GmbH, KONGSTEIN GmbH, and Wystrach GmbH.
Scientists from Australia's University of Adelaide recently discovered a way to produce hydrogen directly from untreated seawater. For this, they introduced an acid layer on the catalysts in situ.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/27/study-shows-n-type-bifacial-topcon-cells-more-prone-to-degradation-than-p-type/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 27, 2023",Study shows n-type bifacial TOPCon cells more prone to degradation than p-type,"Researchers at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) have conducted a series of damp heat tests to assess the impact, in terms of moisture degradation, of different encapsulation materials on performance losses in bifacial PV modules.
“The purpose of this research was to find an explanation for degradation phenomena observed in small laboratory bifacial module samples after extended damp heat testing,” the research's lead author, Paul Sommeling, told pv magazine.
In the study “Corrosion effects in bifacial crystalline silicon PV modules; interactions between metallization and encapsulation,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, the scientists made a comparison between three encapsulant materials used in PV module production: ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polyolefin elastomers (POE) and thermoplastic polyolefins (TPO).
The research group said it observed in previous studies that POE and TPO, unlike EVA, do not release any acidic components, which means they may perform better than EVA with respect to acid-induced corrosion. However, there is no proven evidence yet that these materials may actually result in increased module durability in the field, as it takes a long time before relevant field degradation can be observed.
Through damp heat testing with a duration of up to 2,500 h, the academics compared the performance of the three materials in glass-encapsulant-cell-encapsulant-glass-based laminates without the use of an edge sealant.
“Commercially available n- or p-type bifacial cells (TOPCON and PERC respectively) have been used to build these laminates, which have subsequently been tested in a climate chamber under damp heat conditions (85 C/85% relative humidity),” they explained. “Current-voltage (IV) and electroluminescence (EL) measurements have been conducted at 500 h intervals to follow the change of laminate characteristics over time.”
They used a technique known as “coring” to enable post-mortem analyses of all samples tested. For this, they used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to analyze the effects of the tests on the solar cell surface. All encapsulants were tested according to the IEC 61215 PV standard and beyond, with extended testing time.
According to the research group, the testing showed that hydrophobic and chemically inert TPO encapsulants provided the highest degree of protection against moisture-induced degradation compared to EVA and POE. It also indicated that front-side metallization of the n-type TOPCon cells tested is more prone to acid- or moisture-induced degradation than their p-type counterparts.
“This front-side metallization of TOPCon cells degraded faster than the rear-side metallization and also faster than the metallization of PERC cells in EVA-based laminates,” the scientists emphasized. “We attribute those differences to the different compositions of the cell metallization applied.”
They concluded that the main factor causing delamination of the metal grid is the degradation of lead glass probably, which they said is part of the cell metallization grid and contains lead oxide (PbO). 
“These results are partly surprising,” Sommeling said. “Corrosion effects in PV are known and have been reported in the literature studying both the effects after field exposure and after accelerated testing in the laboratory.”
He also explained that the most severe corrosion problems are to a large extent related to the release of acetic acid from EVA, the most widely used encapsulating material in PV panels. The acid causes corrosion of cell metallization and/or tabbing material or solder joints. Currently, EVA is being replaced by alternatives that do not release any acidic compounds and this helps to prevent a lot of problems related to corrosion.
“The surprising or ‘new' aspects described in our paper consider the quite striking differences observed between different types of metallization and different solar cells with respect to corrosion behavior, which can be correlated to different compositions of the cell metallization,” Sommeling added. “Also without acids present, corrosion still can occur just by the influence of moisture and again this is widely varying between the different types of metallization applied.”
“It can be concluded that the specific combination of the n-type TOPCon solar cells studied in our paper in combination with EVA is probably a higher risk one, compared to other combinations of cell types and encapsulants,” Sommeling affirmed. “Application of EVA in combination with relatively high corrosion susceptible metallization should and can actually be avoided. Alternatively, if the more corrosion-resistant metallization types identified can be applied to TOPCon solar cells, this should also help in building more corrosion-resistant n-type PV panels.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/27/role-of-hydrogen-batteries-in-uks-decarbonation-efforts/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,EUROPE,UNITED KINGDOM",MARIJA MAISCH,"APRIL 27, 2023","Role of hydrogen, batteries in UK’s decarbonization efforts","Based upon current government policy positions, total energy carried by battery energy storage systems (BESS) and hydrogen technology (including hydrogen derived fuels) in the future UK energy system will increase rapidly to reach approximately 130 TWh and 105 TWh respectively per year by 2050, according to a new report.
However, considerable uncertainties remain in the relative adoption of both technologies, according to “The Role of Hydrogen and Batteries in Delivering Net Zero in the UK by 2050,” which was authored by Norway's DNV and commissioned by UK-based Faraday Institution.
“Batteries and hydrogen have distinct characteristics and should largely be viewed as complementary rather than competing technologies,” says Faraday Institution CEO Pam Thomas. “Both will require significant technological advance and extensive scale up of manufacturing and deployment if the UK is to meet its obligation to reach net zero by 2050. The varying timescales of their rollout leads to considerable uncertainties in predicted market share profiles over time.”
Specifically, the uptake of the two technologies in different sectors, including: road vehicles, aviation, maritime, rail, built environment, manufacturing and power, will be impacted by the rate of technology development, infrastructure development, capital costs, total cost of ownership, customer perceptions and other policy factors, the report finds.
The primary use of battery technology is focused on road transport, accounting for 88% of all battery usage by 2050 with aviation and the power sector making up most of the remaining energy use, the report finds. Only limited use of batteries is expected in the rail and maritime sectors, and no significant use in manufacturing or the built environment, with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and behind-the-meter solar PV applications captured within the power sector.
For hydrogen, the use of energy is more evenly distributed with aviation, maritime, and manufacturing providing 79% of all hydrogen use by 2050, in addition to contributions from road transport and the power sector. The overlap between batteries and hydrogen is expected to be limited in the power sector, with hydrogen used to balance demand over a longer seasonal period.
Utility-scale BESS is forecasted by DNV to increase to 24 GW, with average energy duration of BESS modelled to increase from one hour today to almost four hours by 2050, in addition to 45 GW of  V2G energy storage coming from electric vehicles.
However, DNV’s calculation is looking conservative when compared with recent figures released by Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy, which expects 24 GW of utility-scale batteries to be installed already by the end of this decade and attracting investments of up to $20 billion.
“Large-scale battery developments will soon be the norm in the UK, solving the problem of balancing short-term power demand with the intermittency of wind and solar generation. And this could just be the start. Further growth could soon be on the way if the government introduces additional incentives to spur investments,” says Pratheeksha R, renewable energy analyst at Rystad Energy.
Of the 4.7 GW of installed energy storage capacity in the UK today, BESS account for about 2.1 GW. Most of the current capacity, 2.8 GW, comes from pumped hydro storage. The UK government is eyeing 30 GW of capacity by 2030, including batteries, flywheel, pumped hydro, and liquid air energy storage.

Faced with a profound energy crisis since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the country is now considering a ban on new gas and oil heaters from 2024. This has sparked much discussion about the ability of heat pumps to economically compete with gas heating, as well as the role of PV in reducing electricity bills.
Although simulation data on the return on investment of heat pumps and their symbiotic relationship with rooftop PV abound, field statistics are harder to come by. Tim Riedel, a sustainability consultant at Berlin-based Planetgroups, has shared data from a heat pump and PV system installed at his single-family home in Germany.
Riedel installed an air-source heat pump system on his listed building from 1796 on Feb. 24, 2022, consisting of an external heat pump unit with a heating output of up to 12.86 kW, a 170-liter hot water storage tank, and a smaller indoor unit for heating water located in the property's basement.
“Between May and October, the main heat pump is not active at all, we just use the small one to heat water,” Riedel told pv magazine. “In the long run, it will be more cost-effective, because it is more efficient to heat the water with the small heat pump. Then the larger one doesn’t have as many starts, which extends its life span.”
The heat pump system cost €31,000 ($34,260), including installation services. It was eligible for a €10,500 subsidy from Germany's heat pump rebate scheme, bringing the price down to €20,500.
Riedel reports his property consumed 20,000 kWh of gas in 2021, while the heat pump used 4,009 kWh of electricity from April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023. Given an electricity price of €0.53/kWh and a gas price of €0.18/kWh, the heat pump system resulted in savings of €1,595 per year, Riedel said. The system’s payback time is thus around 13 years, based on current gas and electricity prices.
“This result on investment doesn’t even take into account the fact that a new gas heating system would also cost money,” Riedel noted. “The paying back period of only the additional costs of a heat pump compared to a gas heating system would be much shorter.”
The Riedel family also has a 24 kW PV system installed on the rooftop of their barn, which further maximizes their yearly electricity savings. The system was installed in 2020 and features 325 W solar modules from German manufacturer Heckert Solar. It produces 19,000 kWh of electricity a year and had a total cost of €26,000, including installation on the barn’s flat roof.
The rooftop PV system produced 1,433 kWh of the electricity consumed by the heat pump, according to Riedel. At a price of €0.07/kWh for the self-consumed electricity, the PV and heat pump system resulted in yearly savings of €2,256 compared to heating with gas.
The Riedel family installed a heat pump system without modernization or insulation work. Their 18th-century house uses conventional radiators, and they replaced one with a bigger one. A smart thermostat controls the system remotely for efficient heating.
Given its yearly heating output of around 20,000 kWh and electricity consumption of 4,009 kWh, the heat pump system shows a seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) of 5. According to its datasheet, the coefficient of performance (COP) is 2.98 at an external temperature source of 7 C and 4.14 at 2 C. The SCOP reported on the datasheet is 4.53.
“This five to one [heating output to electricity consumption] ratio isn’t just due to the heat pump. It’s also because of how we use it with the smart meter,” said Riedel. “We also had temperature control before [installing the heat pump system], but this meter is just a bit smarter.”
Riedel noticed decreased efficiency when outside temperature was below -3 C, and significant electricity consumption at -10 C, but the heat pump's cold weather performance is not a major concern, as Germany only has such weather for a short period.
“People are very risk-averse, they buy their equipment as if they need to survive a winter in the North Pole. What they don’t realize is that we have maybe a week or two of really cold weather in Germany every winter.”
