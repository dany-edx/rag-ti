The SUB Solar system is installed on recycled fish-cage float rings and can be used in combination with onshore power supplies to reduce the need for diesel generators, which are traditionally used to power fish farms. It also allows for excess electricity to be sold to the grid.
The floating solar system is particularly suitable in combination with hybrid system solutions that pair batteries with downsized diesel generators, according to the company.
Inseanergy recently installed its first commercial installations after completing a pilot project with Hofseth International at one of its fish farms in Stranda, Norway. DNV and Trondheim-based research firm SINTEF tested the demonstrator and conducted a risk analysis. The upgraded SUB Solar floating system is now in the process of securing DNV certification, according to Inseanergy.
Inseanergy CEO Kari-Elin Hildre told pv magazine that the company recently installed a 290 kW floater with a diameter of 51 meters at a salmon farm in Krakholmen, Norway. Its first commercial installation was a 160 kW floater for cod-farming specialist Gadus Group.
During regular operating hours at the fish farm, the solar panels are submerged in water, which cools them down. It also increases the weight and stability of the structure, and prevents soiling on the panels. In addition, Inseanergy uses a pump and bilge system to remove dirt and excess particles from the floating structures.

The Chinese PV module manufacturer originally introduced the G12 Himalaya series in mid-2022. It came in five versions, with power outputs ranging from 680 W to 700 W. It has now announced a new 715 W module, certified by TÜV SÜD Group.
“Recently, Huasun’s Himalaya G12-132 HJT module successfully passed the full sequence test of TÜV SÜD Group and obtained the standard certification IEC61215 on PV module performance,” the company said in a statement. “The maximum output power of the module has reached a breakthrough of 715W, setting a new high in the power of the same dimension of PV modules in the industry.”
The first five variants have power conversion efficiencies ranging from 21.90% to 22.5%. The open-circuit voltage is between 49.5 V and 50.13 V and the short-circuit current spans from 17.19 A and 17.43 A.The 715 W module has an efficiency of 23.02%, a Huasun spokesperson told pv magazine.
The new panels measure 2,384 mm x 1,303 mm x 35 mm and weigh 38.7 kg. They feature 132 half-cut monocrystalline HJT cells measuring 210 mm x 105 mm, combined with single-sided microcrystalline and super multi busbar (SMBB) cell technology.
“It has double-glass structure, encapsulated with PIB, which not only has the high-efficiency properties of HJT, but also has better water resistance and anti-PID performance,” said the company.
The new products can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and feature an IP67/IP68 enclosure, with black anodized aluminum frames. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.26% per degree Celsius and their operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C. Both sides of the bifacial modules are covered with 2.0 mm glass. Their bifaciality reportedly reaches up to 85%
The new products come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 88% of the nominal output power.
Huasun said expects its production capacity to exceed 10 GW in 2023.

But such regions also present a challenge in the form of harsh weather conditions and dust particles that can badly affect the performance of a PV system.
Soiling has been well studied as an issue affecting PV performance, and project operators today have a wealth of tools available to clean modules in the field and to calculate the best time to do this, based on the balance between lost energy yield and the cost of a cleaning cycle. While these mostly focus on the direct losses caused by dust blocking light from the module, however, soiling is also known to play a role in some mechanisms that cause more permanent performance loss to PV systems in the field.
A group of scientists led by Mohamed First University in Morocco conducted a one-year study of soiling on modules in the field. The group installed crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride PV modules at a site in Ben Guerir, Morocco. The installation consisted of two modules for each technology, one of which was cleaned daily, and one which was left to accumulate dust and dirt.
As expected, the study showed that soiling effects are most damaging during the driest periods of the year. The group also found that the cadmium telluride modules were less affected by soiling related losses – they peaked at a 13% daily performance loss, while silicon modules reached 15%.
The scientists described the results of the study in “Experimental study on the impact of soiling on the modules temperature and performance of two different PV technologies under hot arid climate,” which was recently published in Heliyon. They also found that the modules affected by soiling ran at higher temperatures. The group suggested a module to calculate soiling effects on module temperature and efficiency at a given location, and said that conducting further studies in different climates would help to further increase the accuracy of the module.

The notion of ultra-low-cost solar (ULCS) has been gaining traction since Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) CEO Darren Miller made it the topic of a plenary session at the 2022 All-Energy Australia conference in Melbourne. Miller positioned UCLS at the heart of the agency's new strategy, and now ARENA has announced AUD 41.5 million in funding across 13 research projects to support the research, development and commercialization of activities working to realize ultra-low-cost solar.
In his plenary address at the All-Energy Australia conference in October, Miller said that Australia's role in global decarbonization would be to “capitalize on our unfair advantage in renewable energy generation … If we can make ULCS a reality, we can dramatically and cost-effectively reduce emissions in hard-to-abate sectors … we can maintain our position as a major producer and exporter of energy products.”
To this end, ARENA's funding aligns with projects that support its “Solar 30 30 30” target for 30% module efficiency and 30 cents per installed watt at utility scale by 2030.
The funding has been awarded to researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), the University of Sydney (USYD), and the Australian National University (ANU). According to the agency, the sheer strength of applications necessitated a further AUD 1.5 million in funding allocation.
“Australia’s solar researchers have helped to make solar PV the cheapest form of energy in history, but to create a future in which Australian solar energy supplies the world with clean power, fuels and products, we need to be ambitious and drive the cost of solar even lower,” Miller said.
The funding pot has been split into two streams. The first, consisting of AUD 27.5 million, is devoted to innovation in cells and modules. The second, consisting of AUD 14 million, is devoted to balance of system (BOS), operations and maintenance research.
USYD Professor Anita Ho-Baillie and SunDrive are among the recipients of funding after ARENA awarded AUD 2.78 million for a research project that seeks to improve the commercial viability of perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells. Ho Baillie described the technology, which sees perovskite stacked on top of silicon solar cells, as the “future” of solar technology.
“The idea of this stacking is to convert more energy from the sun to electrical power,” said Ho-Baillie. “The efficiency that can be achieved by a perovskite-silicon tandem in a laboratory is now over 30%, while the highest efficiency for a silicon cell on its own is just below 27% in the laboratory and around 23% commercially. There isn’t much room for silicon to improve because its theoretical limit is only 30% – but for perovskite-silicon tandem, it is 40%.”
Sydney-based SunDrive, which has attracted investment from former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Mike Cannon-Brookes' Grok Ventures, is already successful in progressing PV innovation from the lab, through to full-size commercial solar panel fabrication. SunDrive's co-founder and chief executive, Vincent Allen, described the project as “exciting” and an accelerant to the development of “more progressive solar technologies such as perovskite silicon tandems.”
UNSW Professor Bram Hoex from the School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Engineering said the funding allows UNSW and other Australian research universities “to continue to be in the driver's seat of technology development and commercialisation with an increased focus on utility-scale solar, and so driving down emissions and growing the Australian economy at the same time.”

It reports that prices for monocrystalline silicon currently range from CNY 148 ($21.50)/kg to CNY 182/kg, while polycrystalline silicon prices are between CNY 145/kg and CNY 177/kg. Compared to the peak registered in November, the average price of the raw material has fallen by more than 42%.
The CNINA said the decline was due to a slight demand reduction at the end of the year and the increasing capacity of the Chinese polysilicon industry. According to its estimations, China's domestic polysilicon capacity reached 1.2 million metric tons (MT) by the end of 2022. It estimates that the country's polysilicon capacity will hit 2.4 million MT by the end of 2023.

They claim that it can detect the moments in which systems start to malfunction, while distinguishing shadows from other causes of malfunctions.
The algorithm can be used for unsupervised, automated monitoring of partially shaded residential PV systems. The scientists claim that it can create a reference data set based on neighboring PV systems with similar characteristics.
“The new algorithm is based on two older algorithms, developed based on PV production data extracted using a testing facility, and it is adjusted according to the needs of data extracted from residential systems,” the researchers said.
The algorithm determines whether detected malfunctions were caused by shadows or other factors. It then creates a profile for each shadow affecting a system.
“The resulting shadow profile can be used to calculate the energy loss due to any obstacles and to predict the shadow in a future year in order to immediately distinguish it from any occurred malfunctions,” the research team said.
The group tested the new methodology on a large sample of PV systems, including some with string inverters, for different types of shadows. They said the new algorithm can isolate malfunctions due to shadows from the rest of the sample and estimate related power losses.
“Furthermore, by processing one full year of data with the proposed algorithm, the energy losses due to a potential shadow for future years can be estimated,” they explained. “Thus, any new observed power loss can be identified immediately and proper actions can be taken by the operator/owner of the system for very fast repairs.”
The researchers presented the novel methodology in “A density-based time-series data analysis methodology for shadow detection in rooftop photovoltaic systems,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
“The method is proven to be highly adequate in the presented examples and can be used as well in an online cloud-based monitoring platform, where the combined power data of neighbouring PV systems, in which panels are connected as strings to inverters, could form reference data for each monitored PV system,” they concluded.
