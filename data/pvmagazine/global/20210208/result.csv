The latest figures provided by the CER show an estimated 7.0 GW of renewable energy capacity was installed in Australia last year, 11% higher than the previous record of 6.3 GW set in 2019.
The CER’s Quarterly Carbon Market Report for December 2020, which is expected to be released at the end of February, also shows that a record 53.6 TWh of electricity was generated into the National Electricity Market (NEM) – up 16% from the previous year.
The report also highlights that over the final quarter of 2020 the share of renewables in the NEM exceeded 30%.
Key to that record growth is the nation’s widespread acceptance of rooftop solar PV, with the Australian Energy Council’s (AEC) latest Solar Report confirming record growth in solar PV capacity and installations during 2020.
AEC chief executive Sarah McNamara said that despite the setbacks triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia’s rooftop solar PV market had been remarkably resilient with an additional 2.6 GW and 333,978 installations added to the grid during the year – both the capacity and installations are about 18% higher than 2019 (2.2 GW and 284,000 installations).
By the end of 2020 there were more than 2.66 million Australian homes and businesses with solar rooftops, McNamara said. This figure is expected to rise due to the fact that consumers have up to 12 months in which to register their installations.
“Overall, there was a noticeable dip in installations in April 2020, which marks the impact of COVID-19. Since then, the general trend has been for continued growth,” she said.
“New South Wales reported the highest monthly installations, while Queensland took over the second spot from Victoria in the last quarter of 2020.”
New South Wales led the way in 2020, recording a 36% increase in new installed capacity, adding 208 MW to the NEM.
Western Australia also saw remarkable growth, with a 24% increase in new installed capacity, adding 60 MW to the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM), while the number of new installations increased 22%.
The AEC said 2020 also marked a strong year for home battery installations with rooftop solar PV systems. Queensland, which led this trend in 2019 with a 32% market share for the year, was overtaken last year by South Australia, which claimed a 42% share.
While the growth has given rise to some concerns, not least grid security, federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the latest figures cement Australia’s reputation as a renewable energy powerhouse.
Taylor said Australia has the highest uptake of solar in the world with one in four homes using it and the highest wind and solar capacity of any non-European country.
“In 2019, Australia deployed new renewable capacity at least 10 times faster per person than the global average and four times faster per person than China, Europe or the United States,” Mr Taylor said.
“In 2020, Australia invested $7.7 billion or $299 per person in renewable energy. This places us ahead of countries like Canada, Germany, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and the United States on a per-person basis.”
Strong investment in renewables is forecast to continue, with Australia projected to deploy an additional 24 GW of rooftop solar by 2030, tripling the nation’s small-scale solar generating capacity over the decade.

Tejas Borja has been manufacturing tiles in Llíria, Valencia, in southeastern Spain, since 1899. Its catalog includes the Flat-5XL tile which, with dimensions of 457 x 510 mm and a weight of 6.55 kg, is claimed to be the largest ceramic tile in the world.
This tile is also available in a photovoltaic version, the Solar Flat-5XL, which is an ultra-flat ceramic tile that includes a glass-glass photovoltaic panel. The product is also equipped with an anti-reflection full-black cover that allows the entire system to be concealed, without altering the roof design. The connections of the photovoltaic cells are invisible so that their visual impact on the roof is the minimum possible.
“The normal tile is already a world benchmark and there is no such large tile on the market with solar integration,” the company's R&D specialist, Miguel Usach, told pv magazine.
Tejas Borja manufactures three different BIPV products. The Solar Flat-5XL ceramic tile with dimensions of 457 x 510 mm and a weight of 7.5 kg, which is available in two versions: a monocrystalline tile with a power output between 24.2 Wp and 143.26 Wp / m2; a tile made with solar cells of copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS) with power output ranging from 17 W to 102 W / m2.

Tejas Borja explained that the solar cells are being provided by two undisclosed manufacturers, one based in Spain and one operating in Taiwan. “For the first year, we offer a performance guarantee of 99% on the monocrystalline version and 97% on the CiGS, and above 80% for the next 20 years on both versions,” Usach stated. “The ceramic support has a guarantee of 50 years, like all those of Tejas Borja.”
The third product is the Solar Flat-10 roof tile, which is also built with CiGS technology. It measures 457 x 1,268 mm, weighs 9.30 kg and has 56 Wp and 123 Wp / m2 of power. It is made with an aluminum frame and is finished in full-black color.
The electrical installation of the solar tiles is carried out through international standard connections. “We always advise on the design and specification of the installation with our products and we provide the installers with the installation diagram,” Usach further explained.
The tiles can be easily deployed by fixing them directly with screws on the roof strips, like any flat ceramic tile, inside the skirts, without the need to drill or place additional structures, according to the company. “This avoids the risk of leaks caused by errors in execution or maintenance, and ensures tightness and safety, while avoiding the ‘sail effect',” Usach said, adding that the roof is covered with the support ceramic, which also provides thermal and acoustic insulation.
Usach did not reveal details on the product price, which he said depends on the characteristics of a project. He added, however, that it was seeing very good acceptance among customers. “A commercial project has just been carried out in Belgium and another residential one in Valencia,” said Costina Rusen, Tejas Borja's marketing manager. 
The company also claims to have several large projects underway, both in the residential and hotel sectors, in Latin America.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/08/bangladesh-new-development-plan-targets-aggressive-efforts-in-re-generation/,"MARKETS,ASIA,BANGLADESH",SYFUL ISLAM,"FEBRUARY 8, 2021",Bangladesh: New development plan targets ‘aggressive efforts’ in RE generation,"A new development strategy, recently unveiled by the Bangladesh government, is targeting “aggressive efforts” and immediately providing required policy support to enhance energy generation from renewables.
“During the eighth five-year plan the renewable energy generation strategy will have to be aggressively pursued so that all that is planned gets implemented in time and where policy support is required should be given forthwith,” it said.
The plan has identified several factors behind the failure in achieving the renewable energy goals, which include 10% clean energy generation by 2021. The impediments include continued subsidisation of fossil fuel use and inadequate incentives to renewable energy.
“Both of them have adversely affected demand and supply of renewable energy,” the government’s plan for 2021-2025 stated.
“There will be renewed effort to improve the focus and implementation of the RE policy during the eighth five-year plan period,” it said.
The eighth plan will continue the seventh plan's focus on two main areas of renewable energy: solar and wind power. “There is already significant success in the area of solar energy in home lighting,” the government report said. “The rooftop solar PV systems have been successfully introduced in the country.”
Presently some 716.72 MW of electricity is being generated from renewable sources. Additionally, some 543 MW renewable are under construction and another 1,416 MW renewable projects are at the planning stage.
Underscoring the need for “strong efforts” to enhance RE generation, the document noted that Bangladesh was increasing grid-connected renewable generation capacity while network and operation capacity would also need to be improved.
One key strategic focus proposed under the Perspective Plan 2041 will be the encouragement of renewable energy supply by private producers, including supply to the grid as well as direct sales to households.
The government is also pushing for commercial renewable energy projects to be implemented by the private sector, while different ministries and agencies would implement social projects.
As part of its social responsibility, the government will install solar systems in rural health centres, remote educational institutions, union level e- service centres, remote religious establishments, off-grid railway stations, and government and semi-government offices in off-grid areas.
“This will then be setting the stage for a more visible shift to the active use of renewable energy and a concomitant reduction in the consumption of fossil fuel…,” it said.
Dipal C Barua, president of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, told pv magazine that the new plan had given immense importance to renewable energy.
“We appreciate the government’s wise decision to take real efforts for enhancing clean energy generation,” he said.
Barua said the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was going up worldwide, which means that over dependence on LNG for electricity generation will lead to higher subsidy from the public exchequer.
“Setting up renewable energy-based power plants will ultimately help lower the government’s subsidy for electricity generation,” he added.

It claims that it can achieve higher module efficiencies when the cell gaps in the strings are eliminated.
The 132-half-cell “e.Gapless M HC” modules will be available with power outputs of 400 W and 425 W. The format barely differs from standard modules with 60 full cells, despite the higher performance, the manufacturer said. The new panels will be built on its own patented 12-busbar technology and will be available from the fourth quarter of this year.
“The gapless technology is another important innovation in photovoltaic module construction and Energetica is part of this technical avant-garde of selected manufacturers,” said Energetica CEO Rene Battistutti.
Energetica claims it will be the first European module maker to commercially offer modules with this technology. “With the new gapless technology, which we have been testing for more than two years, we are setting another milestone in the efficiency of our photovoltaic modules,” it said.
It plans to build a gigawatt-scale production facility in Liebenfels, Austria. Its innovations include its Smartflower products. It plans to manufacture components for the Smartflower line in Liebenfels.

France-based battery cell producer Verkor has gained the support of Capgemini SE, a French multinational corporation that provides consulting, technology, professional and outsourcing services, for its plan to build a 16 GWh battery cell manufacturing facility in Rodez, about 150 km northeast of Toulouse, in the Occitanie department of Aveyron.
Capgemini will bring its expertise in digital transformation, technology services and engineering to harness the full potential of digital and data for excellence in low-carbon battery manufacturing, Verkor said. “One of the goals of Capgemini is to improve the manufacturing process for Verkor's batteries, reducing waste and inefficiency, but also improving the environmental and economic performance of Verkor's business model,” the company further explained.
Capgemini has joined other partners in the project such as Schneider Electric, EIT InnoEnergy and Idec Groupe, which announced their partnership with Verkor in August 2020. “The key to our success is to bring together the best talents, resources and skills from around the world in order to bring to the market by 2023 low-carbon batteries made in France,” said Verkor CEO Benoit Lemaignan.
“We are excited to apply our know-how in digital and contribute hand in hand with Verkor to the creation of a modern, connected and highly efficient gigafactory in France,” stated Roshan Gya, director of southern and central Europe at Capgemini Invent.
Battery production at the proposed Verkor fab would start in 2023 with an initial annual manufacturing capacity of 16 GWh that could rise to 50 GWh depending on demand, according to the start-up.
IDEC Group and Grenoble-based partner ER2I are overseeing land acquisition for the project as well as the design and construction of the fab, with Schneider Electric bringing its industrial expertise and strong links to Europe's existing battery supply chain.

The Indian government is working towards making the union territory of Ladakh carbon-neutral, just as the nation’s Sikkim has made its mark as a fully organic state in the northeast. Renewable energy is set to play an important role in achieving this goal as the state enjoys high solar irradiance and hydel potential.
“In the various assessments done, Ladakh has a potential of 30 GW of solar, 5 GW of wind, 2 GW of hydro, and 300 MW of geothermal,” Radha Krishna Mathur, lieutenant governor of Ladakh, said last year.
Now power minister RK Singh has announced that the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is already working towards the installation of 10 GW hybrid renewable power projects in the union territory of Ladakh. 
The Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and Ladakh Administration are identifying land for this project. And the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) is preparing the detailed project report for the necessary transmission infrastructure, the minister informed.

As a result, however, renewables grid integration and grid stability have become challenging in the area, especially because the island has low energy demand. Although in 2019 a 300 MW interconnection line was switched on to enable some electricity exchange with Japan's northeastern region of Tōhoku, grid congestion and stability in the island remain critical and grid operators are allowed to enforce curtailment against wind and solar power producers without compensation up to 30 days per year to balance supply and demand.
A possible solution to make large-scale solar still viable in the region and to avoid curtailment from local network operators is the construction of plants connected to storage. A good example is being provided by a 6 MW / 21 MWh facility that Chinese inverter manufacturer Sungrow energized at the end of 2020. The plant relies on inverters and a containerized storage solution based on lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NCM) provided by the company and occupies a surface of around 85 hectares.
“The batteries smooth the power generated, allowing it to be integrated into the grid more effectively,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The robust design makes it durable and weather-resistant, especially important in Hokkaido where the temperature can be lower than -35 degrees Celsius.”
Sungrow explained that the project is entitled to a high feed-in tariff of 21 JPY ($0.19)/ kWh but that the connected AC capacity of the plant is limited to only 845 kW due to limited grid availability. “As one of the countries with the most stringent grid codes, Japan presents us lots of opportunities and challenges,” Sungrow added, without providing more technical or financial details on the project.
In October, SB Energy, a subsidiary of Japanese multinational conglomerate holding company SoftBank, completed a 102.3 MW / 27 MWh solar-plus-storage plant built on 132 hectares of land near the town of Yakumo.
On the island of Hokkaido, there is currently another large-scale solar-plus-storage project under development. Property developer Tokyu Land is building a 92 MW of solar with 25.3 MWh of lithium-ion storage capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/08/effective-approaches-to-build-colored-perovskite-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SINGAPORE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 8, 2021",Effective approaches to build colored perovskite solar cells,"The installation of PV devices based on perovskite solar cells in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) or urban settings poses a series of challenges in terms of aesthetic integration and fabricating them with different colors, at a low cost, could be an optimal solution for their broad adoption and commercialization.
Scientists from Singapore's Energy Research Institute at Nanyang Technological University have identified two main approaches to fabricate colorful opaque and semitransparent perovskite solar cells for applications in urban environments and have discussed the advantages and disadvantages of both categories of techniques in terms of transparency, efficiency, commercial feasibility, scalability, and color tunability.
“The main requirements for efficient perovskite solar cell integration in an urban context include the possibility of color tunability maintaining high power conversion efficiencies, the simplicity and scalability of the fabrication processes, and transparency,” the research group explained, noting that there is an unavoidable trade-off between the aesthetic properties and light-harvesting in similar devices.
One of the two approaches is based on the modifications of the perovskite cell's internal layers, such as the absorber, the electron transporting layers (ETLs), the hole transporting layer (HTLs), or the electrodes.
Specific methods that belong to this category include: working on the perovskite through compositional engineering or through tuning the thickness of the perovskite film; the alteration of the ETL or HTL by tinting or thickness variation or the incorporation of nanostructures, which the academics described as a promising method for good reproducibility and scalability without sacrificing the cell efficiency; the incorporation of photonic crystals in the ETL, which the academics claim to be particularly suitable to create bright colors; and the use of transparent electrodes to modulate the transmission or reflection spectral peaks.
“Among the designs based on internal modifications, tuning the transparent electrode thickness might be the simplest, most favorable, and effective way to tune the perovskite color without additional fabrication processes,” the scientists explained.
The external approach includes the following techniques: the use of dielectric mirrors or colorful coatings to make colorful perovskite solar cells, although with limited light absorption and efficiency; the simple deposition of a colorful coating on top of the surface of semitransparent perovskite cells; the application of spin-coating pigments on the thin silver semitransparent electrode of a perovskite cell; and the use of narrow-bandwidth reflective filters (NBRFs) on the front of the Indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass layer.
“The external modifications lead to minimal limitations on the reproducibility, fabrication, and stability of the perovskite solar cells or semitransparent perovskite cells,” the academics explained. “The main limitation of this approach is the variation of the light absorption due to the additional coating.”
The addition of colorful coatings is considered the most promising external approach, as their integration is said to have a minimal impact on the cells' electronic properties and performance.
“The design considerations for colorful perovskite solar cells must include the application’s utility, location, and orientation together with power conversion efficiency and transparency requirements for specific applications,” the research group concluded.
All the techniques are described in the paper Colorful Perovskite Solar Cells: Progress, Strategies, and Potentials, published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry,

Redox flow storage devices work by storing energy in two separate tanks of fluids. The tanks need different redoxmers, which are redox-active molecules that can store energy in the batteries' electrolytes. These molecule receive and send out electrons, or negatively charged particles. Their electrochemical properties can be significantly affected by the choice of supporting electrolyte.
“The battery fluids also contain supporting electrolytes, which are salt solutions that conduct electricity between the battery’s positive and negative terminals,” the academics said. “The salts move across a membrane between the tanks to balance the charge or discharge of the redoxmers.”
In order to enable the monitoring of RFB performance in real time, carbon-based redoxmer molecules can be used as energy carriers and also to signal a problem known as “crossover.” This issue occurs when the redoxmers migrate to the wrong side of the battery.
“In this case, it’s particularly challenging, because we’re dealing with very small molecules dissolved in an electrolyte and with membranes that are porous,” said researcher Lu Zhang, noting that battery performance is considerably affected when the redoxmers penetrate the membrane between the two tanks.
The Argonne scientists have proposed one promising anolyte molecule for non-aqueous organic redox flow batteries, known as 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BzNSN), because it can be dissolved in a solvent-based electrolyte. At the same time, it can be engineered to fluoresce under ultraviolet light.
“These properties make it an excellent candidate for a self-reporting agent on the health within some types of flow batteries,” they explained.
The scientists conducted fluorimetry measurements at the DOE's Center for Nanoscale Materials to analyze the fluorescence of the BzNSN molecules in common flow battery fluids. Their tests have shown that these molecules exhibit different behaviors, depending on the electrolyte salts used. The electrochemical stability measurements have also shown that one BzNSN molecule configuration, in particular, was able to retain electrochemical function and stability over periods of days when in its charged state.
The scientists also conducted another experiment which showed that the fluorescent glow of the molecule, under ultraviolet light, can indicate how the molecule movements change, depending on the electrolyte composition.
“The fluorescence detection offers a great advantage over other methods because it’s highly sensitive,” said researcher Lily Robertson. “We see the molecule the minute it crosses over.”
They described their findings in “Fluorescence-Enabled Self-Reporting for Redox Flow Batteries,” which was recently published in ACS Publications.

“The full launch of inverters that support 210 modules underlines the environmental and technological interdependency of 210 Ultra-High Power Modules and the 600W+ Photovoltaic Open Innovation Ecological Alliance, both of which were initiated by Trina Solar,” the company said in a statement. The alliance was set up by mostly China-based solar companies in June and aims to cross the 600 W module output threshold.
In its statement, Trina names all the manufacturers that have reportedly unveiled plans to build or develop new inverters for bigger and more powerful modules since the beginning of the year.
The world's largest manufacturer for example — Chinese conglomerate Huawei — should begin producing an upgraded version of its SUN2000-196KTL-H3 device for the Chinese market at the end of March 2021 and of the SUN2000-215KTL-H3 for other global markets at the end of May 2021. “Both models will increase the maximum current per MPPT to 100 ampere, to be compatible with the high current characteristics of 210 modules,” Trina stated.
Furthermore, in early February, Chinese inverter manufacturer Sineng Electric purportedly launched a new string inverter called SP-250K-H for this new market segment and Sungrow said its centralized SG3125HV inverters and SG225HX and SG250HX string inverters are now fully compatible with 210mm solar modules.
Moreover, Germany-based SMA said that all its central inverters and its two string inverters SHP 150 and STP 110 are also now compatible with more powerful products. “GoodWe, Ginlong, Kstar and other inverter makers have also announced the availability of inverters compatible with the 210 Ultra-High Power Modules,” Trina stated without providing further details.
Trina Solar began producing its first modules relying on 210mm wafers in January 2020.

French energy giant Total has acquired a 2.2 GW solar development pipeline, including 600 MW of battery storage assets – all in Texas.
It acquired the project pipeline from developer SunChase Power and private energy investment firm MAP RE/ES.  The portfolio consists of four planned large-scale solar projects, each with co-located battery energy storage systems, in industrial areas close to Houston that have high demand for electricity.
The acquisition comes less than a month after Total announced a joint venture with 174 Power Global, a unit of Hanwha Group, to develop 1.6 GW of solar and storage across the country.
The most recent acquisition means that Total is now developing close to 4 GW of renewable power capacity in the United States. This will contribute to its objective to reach close to 35 GW of renewable generation capacity throughout the world by 2025, said Patrick Pouyanné, chairman and CEO. The oil and gas major had close to 7 GW of renewable generation capacity worldwide at the end of 2020.
Construction of the first two projects is expected to start later this year. All of the projects are set to go online between 2023 and 2024. The remuneration paid by Total to SunChase and MAP RE/ES will be staged as the projects advance.
Total also said it will commit to a 1 GW corporate power purchase agreement sourced from this solar+storage portfolio to cover all electricity consumption at its industrial sites in the United States, including its Port Arthur refining and petrochemicals platform and La Porte and Carville petrochemical sites.
Pouyanné called the PPA “concrete proof” of the company’s ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. He said that Total looks forward to “taking advantage of the many growth opportunities in the U.S. market to address the challenges of the energy transition.”

For Clive Fleming, getting development approval for his business, Reclaim PV Recycling, to set up Australia’s first large-scale PV recycling plant – and taking out a long-term lease on an industrial property near Adelaide, Australia – is a major milestone after years of research and logistical modeling. He aims to stop broken or end-of-life solar panels from going to landfill.
With the facility site secured, Fleming is now kickstarting a nationwide collection network for his business by sending a call to industry operators around Australia to nominate their business sites as recycling depots. Participants need about 48 square meters of free space, and must be willing to store up to three pallets of used solar panels. Around the three-pallet mark, Reclaim PV will organize pickup of the panels and transport them to Adelaide. However, Fleming is also looking to secure panel-processing sites in other states.
“Having a network of drop-off sites will significantly reduce the costs of transporting the panels to our warehouses and recycling facilities, compared to picking up 10 panels here, 15 panels there,” Fleming told pv magazine Australia.
In 2015, Sustainability Victoria estimated that Australia’s installed solar infrastructure has a 15- to 35-year expected lifetime. So the waves of end-of-life panels are not expected to hit the dirt for another decade or so. After pursuing grant-funded research into the best methods of separating the solar sandwich of materials bound together by adhesives such as ethyl vinyl acetate, Reclaim PV developed a recycling process using pyrolysis – the staged application of heat in a furnace to peel away or melt the various components of the panels which are then recovered, sorted and sold to materials companies for reuse.
For the past few years, Reclaim PV has been processing a test trickle of around 10,000 panels per annum,  partnering with major manufacturers such as Q Cells, Suntech, Canadian Solar, and Yingli. Those companies pay to recycle their solar panels that have failed under warranty or been damaged in transit.
The proportion of materials potentially recoverable from solar panels is typically glass (75%), aluminum (8%), silicon (5%), copper (1%) and smaller amounts of silver, tin, lead and other components.
A 2016 study jointly prepared by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that 78 million tons of raw materials – with a combined value of $15 billion – could be recovered from solar panels throughout the world by 2050. The alternative is that solar waste left in landfill can leach materials – such as tin, lead and cadmium – into groundwater, causing health and environmental concerns.
