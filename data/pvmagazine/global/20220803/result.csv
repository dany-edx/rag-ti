The rollout is expected to serve as a proof of concept on the delivery of battery storage projects in the country.
Eskom’s multi-site project represents the first part of a 500 MW BESS initiative announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa, under the government’s measures to address South Africa’s long-running electricity crisis. Last week, the utility said it had selected South Korea’s Hyosung Heavy Industries and China’s Pinggao Group in a competitive solicitation process. The two companies were awarded contracts to design, supply, and install the battery projects, in addition to providing O&M services for a five-year period.
The buildout will include large-scale batteries with capacities of 1,440 MWh per day and 60 MW of solar, which will be implemented in two phases across 12 sites in South Africa. The first phase will include the installation of around 199 MW/833 MWh of battery storage projects alongside 2 MW of PV, while the second phase will involve the rollout of 144 MW/ 616 MWh of battery capacity and 58 MW of solar.
The distributed battery storage projects will be located in remote areas with limited access to Eskom’s distribution network, but close to renewable energy plants operating as independent power producers (IPPs), the utility said. First-phase projects are scheduled for commissioning by June 30, 2023, while the second phase is expected to follow by December 2024. The rollout will be co-financed by the African Development Bank, New Development Bank, the World Bank, and the Clean Technology Fund (CTF).
Eskom expects the projects to demonstrate the role of batteries in enabling the integration of renewables into the country’s energy mix, while helping to alleviate the pressure on the national electricity grid. The project will primarily be used for national peak shaving purposes for four hours per day for at least 250 days of the year, the utility said. It will also be used secondarily for ancillary services and local network support.
Frequent outages
Keeping the lights on has long been a challenge for Eskom. To mitigate this, the utility has launched tenders to procure energy from dispatchable resources, including gas generators and solar-plus-storage projects.
Norwegian renewables developer Scatec broke ground in July on the biggest project awarded through Eskom’s Risk Mitigation Power Procurement Program tender. Once operational, the project will feature 540 MW of solar PV and 225MW/1,140MWh of battery storage capacity, and provide 150 MW of dispatchable power under a 20-year power purchase agreement to the Kenhardt region, which is currently suffering from power shortages.
In recent weeks, the South African utility has been forced to implement rolling blackouts due to a shortage of generation capacity. In June, it started implementing so-called “Stage 6” power cuts – or load shedding – for only the second time in its history. This meant that most South Africans were without power for at least six hours a day. In the meantime, the level of outages has been lowered with additional power cuts.
“But ultimately to put load shedding to bed, what we need is additional capacity because the system as it is at the moment is still unreliable and unpredictable,” Chief Executive Andre de Ruyter recently said.
This echoes plans to deliver significant amounts of renewable energy capacity through the next round of South Africa's Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP). In July, Ramaphosa said that the amount of new generation capacity procured through bid window six for wind and solar power would be doubled from 2,600 MW to 5,200 MW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/03/european-energy-without-russian-gas/,"GEOPOLITICS,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,EUROPE,RUSSIA",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 3, 2022",European energy without Russian gas,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in has made energy security a key issue for the whole of Europe. Approximately 34% of Europe’s gas is supplied by Russia, and the short- and long-term security of this supply is now in doubt, with many countries motivated to quickly reduce their reliance on Russian gas.
Natural gas, however, plays a key role in the continent’s strategy to phase out coal in the electricity supply and move toward renewables, as a transitional fuel with more flexibility, lower investment costs, and lower emissions than other fossil fuels. Since Russia began to ramp up its aggression toward Ukraine earlier this year, scientists led by Denmark’s Aarhus University have been working to quantify how the withdrawal of gas supplied by Russia will affect the European energy mix and energy transition plans up to 2050.
“With the phasing out of Russian gas, we no longer have enough gas for this so-called transition phase,” said Gorm Bruun, associate professor at Aarhus University. “This means that we have to choose between investing in the immediate installation of large amounts of wind and solar energy or falling back on the other options, including coal.”
The group’s modeling is described in full in the paper “Long-term implications of reduced gas imports on the decarbonization of the European energy system,” published in Joule. They identify two scenarios based on CO2 emissions budgets that would correspond to a 1.5 C and a 2 C average temperature increase.
In the 1.5 C  scenario, rapid deployment of renewable energy and electrification of the heating sector will reduce demand for natural gas to below what can be supplied even if 34% less gas is available. In a 2 C scenario, meanwhile, demand for gas reduces more slowly, and would remain above available supply up until 2045. This could require parts of Europe to continue relying on coal for electricity, and price uncertainty would continue. The research estimates that electricity prices in 2025 would be €15/MWh higher, in a scenario where the supply of gas is restricted.
“A reduction in Europe's total gas supply could help accelerate the upscaling of renewable energy sources, provided countries uphold their climate ambitions,” said Ebbe Gøtske, researcher at Aarhus University. “If not, we simply risk that other fossil fuels will replace gas in the interim period towards full decarbonization,”
Gøtske goes on to warn that the 1.5 C scenario will require action on a massive scale from all European countries. “This requires a massive roll-out of renewable energy sources in the form of solar and wind. We need to install approximately 400 GW per year in the years 2025-35, and this will be a huge challenge for European politicians,” he said.
Nevertheless, the group makes no secret of preferred scenario, concluding its research with the statement: “a transition corresponding to the 1.5 C scenario not only decreases the chances of suffering the worst impacts of climate change by reducing direct CO2 emissions, but it also reduces the potential impact of upstream emissions from gas, and it may allow Europeans to experience the freedom of energy independence sooner rather than later.”

Wood Mackenzie said it expects 500 GW in global deployment by 2031, with the United States and China representing 75% of worldwide demand.
Wood Mackenzie said it sees the United States on a path to be a 27 GW annual market by 2031, and 83% of that figure will be utility-scale storage. However, projections for 2022 and 2023 have been trimmed by 34% and 27%, respectively, due to disruptions from antidumping and a countervailing duties tariff suit in the second quarter. Solar-plus-storage projects were impacted heavily by the investigation, leading to about 35% of grid-scale projects being delayed as a result.
The market is expected to be highly consolidated over the next decade. The top 10 nations for deployment are expected to represent 91% of the global demand, with grid-scale storage representing the largest share of capacity.
The European market is expected to increase five times over the next decade, however project economics in Europe are hampering buildout, said Wood Mackenzie. Policy may improve project economics. The European Commission’s REPowerEU plan has provisions to streamline permitting processes for storage and PV systems, and calls for higher renewables targets, which in turn will drive demand for energy storage.
Europe’s energy storage market is characterized by distributed storage more than grid-scale. Distributed storage has numerous benefits, one of the most important being a lessened need for high-power transmission and substation buildout. It also makes the power grid more decentralized and able to respond to extreme weather events and grid outages.
China released a five-year plan for energy storage this year that calls for a large-scale development supply chain by 2025, in which the nation targets a 30% reduction in system costs through improved technology performance. Since the plan was released, 12 provinces and cities announced deployment targets for energy storage, totaling 40 GW.

They claim that it can be used as a wide-gap to cell in tandem devices or for water-splitting hydrogen generation.
CuGaSe2 has band-gap energy of 1.7 eV. It has been used in solar cells with limited fill factor and open-circuit voltage.
“A voltage equal to the theoretical decomposition voltage of 1.23 V is required for water-splitting hydrogen generation,” the scientists said.
The cell has a half-cell solar-to-hydrogen (HC-STH) conversion efficiency of around 8%. They built it with a CGSe photoabsorber layers with modified p–n heterointerfaces. They grew the film via a conventional three-stage process. They also deposited a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer with a nominal thickness of 120 nanometers (nm) to 150 nm on a soda lime glass (LGS) substrate via a chemical bath and performed rubidium (Rb) doping during film growth, in order to improve the cell's fill factor and open-circuit voltage.
“Supplying Rb during film growth is more effective than postdeposition treatment (PDT) at boosting the ternary CGSe photovoltaic performance,” the scientists explained, noting that they also equipped the cell with anti-reflection coating (ARC).
Through standard test conditions, the scientists found that the champion cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 11.05%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.960 V, a short-circuit current density of 15.9 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 72.4%.
“We demonstrated here that the interface recombination could be reduced by controlling the copper-deficient phases present on the CGSe film surface,” they said. “The simultaneous achievement of high open-circuit voltage and fill factor by a CGSe/CdS heterointerface-based solar cell is also a notable result, although both values and the photovoltaic efficiency could be improved further.”
The academics described the cell technology in “Enhanced Performance of Ternary CuGaSe2 Thin-Film Photovoltaic Solar Cells and Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting Hydrogen Evolution with Modified p–n Heterointerfaces,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials Interfaces.

The FITs were previously lowered quarter by quarter, according to the new capacity for which connection requests were received in the previous three-month period. This quarter, however, the tariffs were increased for all PV system categories, as in the second quarter.
The new tariffs range from €0.1951 ($0.1984)/kWh for installations below 3 kW in size to €0.1068/kWh for arrays ranging in capacity from 100 kW to 500 kW.
Different tariffs are applied depending on the project size and location, which can be either on the French mainland, Corsica, or in the nation's overseas territories.
The French government raised the size limit for PV projects that can qualify for fixed tariffs from 100 kW to 500 kW in October. In order to boost development in the rooftop segment, the government also decided to reduce the degression rates planned for the feed-in tariffs.

The device combines a reversible Si anode with halide cathodes and uses hybrid electrolytes to enable cell recharging. In the proposed system configuration, silicon is dissolved during the battery discharge process, and upon charging, elemental Si is deposited. The hybrid electrolytes, which were tailored with halides such as bromine and iodine, reversibly support the Si electro-dissolution and electrodeposition processes in the same cell formation.
“During the discharge process, Si electrodissolution occurs at the anode and, dissolved halides are reduced at the cathode,” the scientists said. “The charging process entails Si species electrodeposition and halide oxidation.”
They assembled all cell components in an Ar-filled glovebox and prepared the silicon electrodes from n-type 4′′ silicon wafers. They also left the cells to rest for three hours to detect possible leakage and used platinum foils as counter electrodes.
After several cycles, the battery achieved a coulombic efficiency of approximately 80%, while showing gradual cell degradation. The cell showed limited power capabilities of 0.1 mA cm–2,” the scientists said. “The presence of appreciable fluoride species is crucial in both establishing surface activation and battery operation, and their depletion is directly linked to cell performance degradation.”
The academics presented the novel battery concept in “Rechargeable Silicon Redox Batteries,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.
“The feasibility of the new design paves the way for higher specific energy devices aiming towards the segments of low power applications. These findings undoubtedly warrant further investigation and electrolyte optimization,” they said.

Meyer Burger has adjusted its production plans for the current and the coming year. It is now assuming a production volume of between 320 MW and 370 MW for its heterojunction solar modules. It initially aimed to produce 500 MW of high-performance modules at its module plant in Freiberg, Germany.
In the first half of 2022, 108 MW of solar modules rolled off the assembly line. A volume of between 210 MW and 260 MW is expected in the second half of the year.
Meyer Burger also recently announced the further expansion of its solar cell and module production in Germany to 1.4 GW of annual output volume. It said this week that the ramp-up of the first line with an annual nominal capacity of 400 MW was technically complete. The ramp-up of the other lines is expected to begin in September. This means that a production capacity of 1.0 GW to 1.2 GW should be available for the coming year, according to Meyer Burger's expectations. It was originally expected to be 1.35 GW.
It said that the production facility currently has a lower-than-expected throughput, compared to the nominal capacity. The delayed start-up points to ongoing bottlenecks in global supply chains.
In addition, the throughput of the currently operating line has been affected by planned shutdowns for the integration of another line. Due to high demand for all three module variants, frequent product changes are currently required. This also has a negative effect on the overall production volume, but Meyer Burger said it wants to minimize this impact in the future.
European and US demand for heterojunction modules is still very strong, it said. Despite higher average sales prices, it has passed higher material procurement costs over to customers. The allocation of quotas for customers for the second quarter of 2023 is currently underway. This is necessary due to the limited production volume.
Meyer Burger will initially continue to focus on the growing and high-margin residential segment. Originally, the manufacturer wanted to sell up to 30% of its production volume in the large-scale segment in the coming year. But in 2023, almost all of the expected sales volume will go to the rooftop market, said the company.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/03/innovation-spreading-through-argentinas-largest-pv-plant/,"FINANCE,INVERTERS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ARGENTINA",,"AUGUST 3, 2022",Innovation key to Argentina’s largest PV plant,"Hoerth: The provincial government is currently reviewing the power purchase agreement (PPA) for the sale of power to the Electricity Wholesale Market Administrator, the Compañía Administradora del Mercado Mayorista Eléctrico (CAMMESA). The final resolution should be issued over the next weeks and the PPA should then be signed. We will have a time frame for the construction of the plan of between 500 and 600 days starting from the financial closing. Compared to the Cauchari I, II, and III projects, which totaled 300 MW, the Cauchari IV and V plants will have several technological innovations, including storage.
Giralt: The Cauchari IV and V facility will have a capacity of 100 MW each and will include storage systems totaling 30 MW/100 MWh. This is going to help CAMMESA stabilize its grid. Furthermore, the solar plant will use bifacial modules with higher power output, compared to Cauchari I, II, and III. It will occupy less surface for the same capacity as the first project.
Giralt: String inverters from Huawei have been used for the project. There were many technical and logistical reasons why we have chosen inverters of this type. Fundamentally, the plant is located at 4,200 meters above sea level and is three and a half hours from San Salvador de Jujuy, which is the closest city. The only route to reach the plant is badly accessible and the maintenance of central inverters for 300 MW of solar would require between six and eight people, who would have to be there every day. Central inverters are very sophisticated artifacts that can only be handled by very specialized people and professionals of this type are not going to live in towns like the one where the Cauchari project is being carried out. So, the idea was to have inverters that can allow maintenance operations with people with low training and, in eight minutes two people can change a string inverter. In the first phase, we used inverters with a power of 50 kW and in the second phase, we will use 215 kW devices. On the other hand, the power of the inverters in the market has followed the trend we have seen for modules. In Cauchari I, II, and III we used modules with a power of 330 W, and now we are planning to use panels with power ranging from 540 W to 570 W.
This year, Huawei's special edition looks at technical challenges to a power system mostly run by inverter-interfaced power sources. The leading topic: Smart PV and Storage – Anytime for Anyone, is achieved by a high degree of digitization, a new business division within the Huawei corporation and strong network of partners.

Giralt: Well, as I said, we will need less surface, structure, and cables for the second part of the project, which means the facility will have less electric losses and a higher power yield. As a result, the levelized cost of the energy of Cauchari IV and V is between 20% and 25% lower than that of the Cauchari I, II, and III projects. The PPA, however, also includes the contribution made by the batteries, for which we plan to invest around $20 million.
Giralt: The 300 MW of the installation is generated by PERC polycrystalline panels provided by China’s Talesun. The project location has irradiation of between 1,000 W/m2 and 1,200 W/m2 with temperatures close to zero degrees. Such conditions increase the performance and efficiency of solar modules. The project was selected by the Argentinean government in the first round of the RenovAr program for large-scale renewables. This section of the plant is selling electricity to the CAMMESA at a price of $60 per MWh under a 20-year PPA, for the second plant, we will have different conditions, as we will also integrate batteries. The plant was built at an altitude of more than 4,000 meters, where there is less oxygen. That could lead to de-rating problems and all the electronic parts of Huawei inverters are sealed and the power module has convection cooling. These are inverters that are very well prepared to maintain low temperatures in the power section, without the need for fans. Thus, even though the solar park is at 4,000 meters of altitude, the inverters do not have a de-rating problem and spend less energy cooling, which means an improved performance by 3% and that means a lot more financial gains.

The scientists said the new polymer responds to the need to develop HTMs that provide superior properties, at a lower cost than PEDOT:PSS. Due to its electrical conductivity and mechanical properties, PANI is currently used in various applications, including drug delivery, photovoltaic cells, plastic batteries, display devices, microelectronics, and chemically modified electrodes, among others.
“Polyaniline is one such candidate as it exhibits attractive attributes such as high conductivity, environmental stability, low cost, easy synthesis, high purity, thin film transparency, and a high degree of processability which are suitable for perovskite solar cells,” the researchers said.
The electrochemically synthesized p-type doped PANI-based HTL showed high electrical conductivity after being doped with nitric acid (HNO3).
“The electrochemical polymerization method by cyclic voltammetry is the preferred method to prepare PANI,” the academics said. “The prepared polymer from this method can possess high purity and good adhesion with the hydrophilic substrate compared to the chemically prepared PANI, which is prone to impurities and poor adhesion to the substrate.”
The PANI-based solar cell achieved an efficiency of up to 16.94%, which compares to 15.11% in a reference cell built with an HTL based on PEDOT:PSS. The researchers attributed the efficiency gain to the improved open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current.
The research group includes scientists from Syracuse University , South Dakota State University, and Huzhou University. The researchers introduced the cell technology in “Electrochemically Prepared Polyaniline as an Alternative to Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells,” which was recently published in ACS Publications.
“These results suggest that the PANI prepared using this easy, fast, and low-cost method can be an excellent alternative to the rather expensive PEDOT:PSS to further improve the PV performance and simultaneously reduce the cost of the perovskite PV technology,” they said.

And researchers from Russia’s Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) and Lomonosov Moscow State University have developed a new cathode material that promises higher energy storage capacity in sodium-ion batteries.
They developed a powder of sodium-vanadium phosphate fluoride (NaVPO4F). It has a particular crystal structure that could ensure 10% to 15% higher energy density than current sodium-ion batteries.
“Our material also compares well with the class of layered materials for cathodes. It provides roughly the same battery capacity and greater stability, which translates into longer life and higher cost-efficiency of the battery,” said Stanislav Fedotov, an assistant professor at Skoltech. “Remarkably, even the theoretical predictions for the competing materials fall short of the practical performance of ours, and this is far from trivial, because the theoretical potential is never fully realized.”
The researchers confirmed the material’s superior characteristics through an experiment, after determining that the crystal structure could unlock the high energy storage potential of NaVPO4F. The one they chose is known as the KTP-type framework and comes from nonlinear optics, which is not common in battery engineering. By combining a NaVPO4F composition and KTiOPO4-type framework via a low-temperature (e.g., 190 C) ion-exchange synthesis approach, the researchers managed to develop a high-capacity and high-voltage positive electrode active material.
When tested in a coin cell configuration in combination with a Na metal negative electrode and a NaPF6-based non-aqueous electrolyte solution, the cathode active material enabled a discharge capacity of 136 mAh g−1 at 14.3 mA g−1, with an average cell discharge voltage of about 4.0 V. The scientists also reported a specific discharge capacity of 123 mAh g−1 at 5.7 A g−1 for the same cell configuration.
They described their research findings in “Development of vanadium-based polyanion positive electrode active materials for high-voltage sodium-based batteries,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.
“Higher energy storage capacity is just one of the advantages of this material,” said Fedotov. “It also enables the cathode to operate at lower ambient temperatures, which is particularly relevant for Russia.”
As lithium prices continue to surge, the need for batteries based on cheap and abundant materials, such as alkali metal sodium, is pressing. The Russian scientists said that efficient materials for sodium-ion batteries could eventually supersede lithium-ion batteries in heavy electric vehicles, such as buses and trucks, as well as in stationary energy storage applications.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/03/world-could-install-250-gw-of-solar-this-year-claims-bloomberg-analyst/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 3, 2022","World could install 250 GW of solar this year, claims Bloomberg analyst","Demand is pushing solar growth across the world to new heights, as Bloomberg senior analyst Rob Barnett forecasts deployment to increase by 30% this year. Total global solar deployment is closing in on 1 TW installed – an impressive milestone for the energy transition.
“The global solar picture is just staggering at this point,” Barnett told Yahoo Finance. “We are on track to install something like 250 GW of solar capacity this year.”
China is contributing the largest share to capacity growth this year, with about 108 GW of new operational PV. This is a near-doubling of the roughly 55 GW installed by China last year. The country has the world’s largest exposure to renewable energy, with 323 GW of solar and 338 GW of wind energy. President Xi Jinping aims for 1,200 GW combined by 2030, and the nation is currently ahead of schedule on that goal, said Bloomberg.
Renewable energy is hitting all-time highs in the United States, too. Renewable generation from solar and wind installations reached 28% in April – a new record for the category. And Barnett said the solar boom has just begun.
“There really is this big, top-line growth scenario that we see unfolding for all of the companies that are participating in the solar supply chain,” said Barnett.
Climate goals are one driver of the red-hot demand for solar, but Barnett said there is another force that is accelerating demand in the near-term.
“I would actually argue that the bigger driver for clean energy demand, particularly here in Europe, is elevated energy costs,” he said.
Costs continue to fall for PV, making it increasingly cost-competitive with oil, which has spiked in price since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Shipments of solar modules have fallen precipitously over 20 years, from $4.88/W in 2000 to $0.34/W in 2021, based on a recent report by the Energy Information Administration.
Barnett said he expects solar demand to retain its momentum, even if oil and natural gas prices cool off.
“It’s certainly possible that if you had some easing in the traditional fuel markets, that it might take the accelerator off, but I don’t really see that as being a material risk on the demand side of the equation for clean energy,” he said.
This demand-side momentum is likely to continue as prices improve and the global economy targets decarbonization.
“I do think that the economics are already quite good. And so you’d have to see such a sea change in terms of gas prices or coal prices, if you’re thinking about the power grid, to really reverse some of the trends. And I just don’t think there’s any appetite for it either,” said Barnett.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/03/tigo-releases-design-quality-tool-for-large-commercial-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 3, 2022",Tigo releases design quality tool for large commercial solar,"US-based DC power optimizer specialist Tigo Energy unveiled a new design quality tool called the Solar PLC Signal Integrity Tool alongside expanded training material for solar engineering, procurement, and construction firms in the commercial and industrial segments.
The validation tool and accompanying training course help installers preempt powerline communications (PLC) signal integrity issues in large-scale commercial and industrial projects. PLC signals can experience “crosstalk”, disturbances in signals that can lead to reduced effectiveness of communications in large-scale PV systems. The updated TS4 Design and Installation Course now includes best practices for mitigation of PLC crosstalk issues at the design stage, preventing issues before they happen.
Tigo also released the Solar PLC Signal Integrity Tool, which can be used to identify crosstalk issues in active solar arrays. The tool is designed to be vendor-neutral and is usable for either Tigo systems or competitor MLPE products. After the PLC assessment is run, Tigo provides a performance score.
The TS4 design and installation course, integrated into the company’s education plaftorm, features a section on PLC rapid shutdown system design as well as a technical deep dive into the Tigo TS4 Flex MLPE product line. It provides best practices and practical guidance for system optimization, and installer education on how to design, install and commission a Tigo system with any compatible solar inverter. The two-hour comprehensive course earns 1.5 NABCEP continuing education credits.
“An important part of our mission at Tigo is to keep installers at the center of everything we do, and investing in tools and training is no small part of that,” said JD Dillon, chief marketing officer at Tigo Energy. “As our partners in the field raise their stakes with ever larger installations, we are supporting them with things like this new PLC Tool, Pure Signal technology, and impactful continuing education to help them design and support the highest quality PV installations.”
Last month, Tigo introduced a solar rapid shutdown device with “Pure Signal” technology, aimed at improving PLC signal quality. Tigo RSS Transmitters with Pure Signal technology are UL PVRSS certified with hundreds of inverter models from leading manufacturers. The new transmitters with Pure Signal technology are compatible with the company’s TS4-A-F and TS4-A-2F rapid shutdown product family and can be easily integrated into new projects or retrofitted into existing installations.
“Our mission is to provide high-quality, reliable, and flexible MLPE solutions to meet customers’ needs for different system configurations. Pure Signal technology delivers on that mission,” said Jing Tian, chief growth officer at Tigo Energy.
