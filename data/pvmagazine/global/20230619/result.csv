“The idea of this short paper was to show that the temperature coefficient of the short circuit current, measured under standard illumination conditions might not well describe the actual operation of tandems,” the research's corresponding author, Maxime Babics, told pv magazine. “Depending on the local spectrum and the temperature range, the current at maximum power (Impp) can increase, decrease or have a mixed behavior. This peculiar effect, well described in this paper, will help the community to better understand their outdoor data as outdoor tandem operation should become more and more common in the next years.”
In the paper “Temperature Coefficients of Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells,” published in ACS Energy Letters, the research group showed the results of a series of tests conducted on a 29.0%-efficient tandem perovskite-silicon device at temperatures ranging from 25 C to 65 C. “Our work also opens the discussion on how to best describe the temperature coefficient in perovskite-silicon or perovskite-CIGS tandems, as it is a key metric given in any module datasheet,” Babics stated.
The scientists said they were not able to predict changes in the current of the tandem cells under real outdoor operation as accurately as for single-junction devices.
In particular, they found that factors such as the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the perovskite subcells, the bandgap of the perovskite, the local solar spectrum, and the operating temperature range are the factors making the assessment of the temperature coefficients critical. “The temperature coefficient of the short circuit current in perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells can be negative, positive, or a mix of both depending on the solar spectrum and operating temperature range,” Babics added.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/19/spotlight-on-topcon-pi-berlin-shares-concerns-about-degradation/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN,WORLD",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"JUNE 19, 2023",Spotlight on TOPCon: PI Berlin shares concerns about degradation,"TOPCon technology has gained a strong foothold in the PV market and is projected to account for more than 75% of n-type capacity by 2023, according to Edurne Zoco of S&P Global Commodity Insights.
Chinese manufacturers have made significant investments in this cell technology, and investors, independent power producers (IPPs), and funds are already becoming familiar with its potential. One contributing factor to TOPCon's success story is its price, which has decreased to just around €0.01 ($0.01)/W more than PERC's over the past two years.
TOPCon outperforms PERC in various “tangible” indicators, including bifaciality coefficient, efficiency, temperature coefficients, and annual degradation. Consequently, financial models based on TOPCon show a more attractive return on investment compared to PERC. Asier Ukar, director of the Spanish headquarters of PI Berlin, says this often serves as the primary driver for choosing TOPCon technology.
However, Ukar notes the importance of not solely relying on data from datasheets but also conducting a thorough and transparent analysis of the technology's long-term behavior, specifically in relation to degradation mechanisms. According to Ukar, it is crucial to identify and address potential risks associated with TOPCon technology early on.
One particular risk identified by PI Berlin is related to the presence of aluminum at the cell-to-cell contacts, which are located at the front of the cell where moisture accumulates. Damp-heat testing and subsequent electroluminescence testing can detect this issue. TOPCon cells are more sensitive to water vapor, so it is recommended to use polyolefin elastomer (POE) on the front side for glass-glass modules, while POE on both sides is preferred for glass-backsheet modules.
Another risk arises from the pressure to reduce the amount of silver in TOPCon cells' busbars, leading to thinner busbars and a less robust grip on the cell. This can result in mechanical damage to the printing and finger interruptions or breaks, leading to decreased performance due to increased effective series resistance. Electroluminescence tests can detect these issues.
TOPCon technology also faces degradation challenges similar to those of PERC technology, such as polarization-induced degradation (PID-p). The front side of TOPCon cells, which has a structure similar to the back side of PERC, can be affected by this phenomenon.
Furthermore, the aluminum oxide passivation layers in TOPCon cells are prone to UV degradation. While PERC technology is not significantly affected due to the aluminum being on the back side, TOPCon is more susceptible because the aluminum oxide passivation layers are located on the light-exposed front side.
Ukar notes the need for adjustments in quality control during TOPCon fabrication, including sample size and specific tests in the laboratory, to address the risks inherent to TOPCon technology. Extended duration tests, such as Damp Heat, Thermal Cycling, or Humidity Freeze, are crucial for assessing the long-term reliability of modules beyond the standard data specified in the datasheet.
Within the bill of materials (BOM) for TOPCon modules, the encapsulant is a key component. An inadequate or low-quality encapsulant can nullify the benefits of TOPCon compared to PERC. The 2023 scorecard by PVEL, which includes the PID192h test, demonstrates substantial variations in extended durability results among different BOMs, even within the same manufacturer.
Ukar notes that some manufacturers relax the acceptance and rejection criteria for TOPCon compared to PERC to minimize yield loss and maintain productivity. However, it is crucial to identify and address these risks early on and with transparency from the industry to fully exploit the benefits of TOPCon.
Despite the associated risks, properly manufactured TOPCon modules outperform PERC and exhibit minimal degradation phenomena.

Energy utility AGL has revealed it plans to build a 500 MW battery with four hours of dispatchable capacity next to the Tomago aluminum smelter near Newcastle, New South Wales, as part of its ambition to add 12 GW of new wind, solar and energy storage to its portfolio by 2035. This includes an interim target to have up to 5 GW of new renewables and firming in place by the end of the decade.
AGL told an investor briefing in Melbourne on Friday the 500 MW/2,000 MWh battery to be built alongside the Tomago smelter, which is the biggest consumer of electricity in New South Wales, accounting for more than 10% of electricity use in the state, is part of a renewables development pipeline that has swelled from 3.2 GW to 5.3 GW in the past four months.
AGL also revealed an unidentified 400 MW battery project in New South Wales and a 500 MW project in Queensland have formally entered its growing pipeline of renewable generation and storage developments. The power giant also revealed plans for a 200 MW solar farm to be developed in New South Wales.
AGL Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Damien Nicks said the addition of the new projects means the company is “well positioned” to achieve its decarbonisation strategy which requires it to increase its development portfolio of renewable energy generation from 1.7 GW to 8 GW of wind and solar by 2035. It will also seek to grow its firming capacity, including grid-scale batteries and pumped hydro, from 1.4 GW to 7.3 GW over that period.
The company has previously announced plans to exit coal-fired generation by 2035 and on Friday reaffirmed its commitment to close down its Bayswater power station in the Hunter Valley between 2030 and 2033 while the Loy Yang A power plant in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley will be shuttered in 2035.
“This is the biggest transition that this market has ever seen in terms of what we are doing over the next 12 years,” Nicks said. “Today we are sharing with the market how we will deliver on our strategy to connect our customers to a sustainable future and transition our energy portfolio.”
AGL is in the final stages of bringing the 250 MW/250 MWh battery at South Australia’s Torrens Island online with the 50 MW/50 MWh battery being developed near the outback NSW city of Broken Hill expected to switch on in the next three months.
Investors were told AGL is on target to deliver 850 MW of grid-scale batteries by the end of 2025 with the utility planning to fact track the development of a 500 MW/2 GWh big battery at the site of the now-shuttered Liddell coal-fired power plant in the Hunter Valley.
AGL said the final investment decision on the Liddell battery has been brought forward to the end of this year, with the first 250 MW stage expected to receive funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).
AGL said it expected to fund 5.5 GW of its targeted 12 GW of newly firmed renewables capacity from its own balance sheet, while the other 6.5 GW would be procured via joint ventures, partnerships, third-party offtakes and distributed energy resources including rooftop solar.

During a joint conference with Brazilian President Lula da Silva, she announced that Europe would invest €2 billion ($2.2 billion) to support Brazil's production of green hydrogen. In Buenos Aires, she held talks with Argentina's President Alberto Fernández to explore potential energy exports to Europe. Hydrogen was a focal point during her meeting with Chile's President Gabriel Boric, where they launched the Fund for Renewable Hydrogen with an initial budget of €225 million. Additionally, the two leaders initiated a technical assistance project.
Norsk Hydro has successfully produced the world's first batch of recycled aluminum using green hydrogen as an energy source, with a test that provides valuable insights into the transition from natural gas to hydrogen and its impact on metal quality. The Norwegian company said that the test examines the differences in behavior and burning temperature between hydrogen and natural gas, and how these variations affect the aluminum melting process and overall.
Air Liquide and Groupe ADP have announced the creation of Hydrogen Airport, an engineering and consulting joint venture specializing in helping airports to integrate hydrogen projects within their infrastructure. The governance team is in place, and the joint venture has begun commercial activities. The venture will focus on estimating the volumes required over time, optimizing logistics, conducting safety and carbon impact studies, and cost analysis.
Archigas has unveiled the results of its microsensor (MEMS) technology, which is capable of functioning effectively in highly humid environments, overcoming a common weakness of hydrogen sensors. Sensor expert Friedemann Völklein said that around 1,200 identical sensors can be obtained from a 10-centimeter silicon wafer, providing optimal conditions for mass production of small, fast, precise, and stable analysis systems. Archigas is collaborating with RhineMain University of Applied Sciences (HSRM), the city of Rüsselsheim am Main, and German investors to further develop the hydrogen sensors.
Plug Power has developed a portable hydrogen refueler solution – a self-contained fueling station “on wheels” with a capacity of 1,500 kilograms. “The refueler is designed to reduce infrastructure costs and deployment time for medium-duty and heavy-duty hydrogen-powered commercial vehicles,” said the US company. Plug Power has already secured contracts with three transit customers for the refueler.

So understanding how different site and installation conditions affect the build up of dust and droppings on a module surface is valuable knowledge for the PV industry.
A group of scientists led by the Vellore Institute of Technology in Tamil Nadu, India, had this in mind when they came up with a simple yet effective way to study the effects of different types of soiling on PV modules. The scientists gathered samples of five different types of soil (black soil, desert soil, red soil, alluvial soil, laterite soil) as well as coal dust and bird droppings, from various locations in India. The samples, in different amounts ranging from 10g to 50g, were then shaken and brushed onto the surface of PV modules, and the modules were tested using a sun simulator.
The results showed that at all tilt angles, bird droppings had the largest impact on module performance, with the 50g sample taking away more than 80% of the modules’ efficiency – a considerably larger loss than any of the dust or soil samples caused.
The study also found that the physical properties of the soiling material play a larger role than the angle of the modules in deciding the soiling rate. The results are discussed in full in the paper Experimental analysis on the impacts of soil deposition and bird droppings on the thermal performance of photovoltaic panels, published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering.
The group says that its study will help contribute to a better overall understanding of the effects of soiling on PV modules. This knowledge could help project developers better assess site conditions and avoid locating a project in regions where soiling will be particularly heavy, or ensuring that appropriate mitigation measures can be included from the start.
They note, however, that the results of this study can only be applied to regions with a hot, dry climate similar to Vellore in India on which the simulation conditions were based – Further, climate-specific studies are needed to draw similar conclusions for other climate types.

Recent studies have proposed using solar-plus-storage microgrids to minimize public safety concerns from power shutoffs (PSPS) during the wildfire season for communities located in wildland-urban interfaces, such as California and much of the US west coast.
A comprehensive assessment of microgrids had not been performed to evaluate the potential to enhance resilience for up to 46 million Americans living next to forests, or a wildland-urban interface, where wildfire risk is acute.
To address this research gap, a study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory looked at a novel modeling framework and assessed the potential of solar and batteries for districts where power can be turned off based on wildfire warnings.
LBNL’s modeling framework consists of:
LBNL defines a microgrid as a controllable and localized energy grid that could be disconnected from the regional grid and operate independently.
An optimization tool was introduced to model microgrids in forest-bordering regions, and subsequently, an assessment was performed focusing on seven localities in California with different climate conditions.

The Germany-based inverter manufacturer showcased the new line at Intersolar Europe last week in Munich, Germany.
The Sunny Boy Smart Energy comes in four versions, with power outputs ranging from 3.6 kW to 6 kW. The inverters measure 500 mm x 586 mm x 236 mm and weigh 17.5 kg.
The transformerless inverters feature three maximum power point tracking (MPPT) points, with efficiency ratings of up to 97.5% and a European efficiency rating of up to 96.8%. The MPPT voltage range is 60 V to 480 V, with a maximum PV power input of 7.2 kW for the 3.6 kW inverters and 12 kW for the 6 kW devices. The maximum input voltage is 600 V.
“The Sunny Boy Smart Energy shines with its fast battery charging capability,” SMA said. “Conventional charging performance is challenged in northern climate by few hours of sunshine and plenty of cloud cover. The Sunny Boy Smart Energy’s fast charging allows more solar power to be harvested and stored in those few hours, ready to power homes and reduce homeowners’ energy costs.”
The inverters have IP65-rated protection and operate within a temperature range of -25 C to 60 C. They come with lithium-ion batteries that have voltages ranging from 90 V to 500 V, supporting a maximum charge/discharge current of 30 A.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/19/japans-vast-wind-and-solar-resources/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,JAPAN",,"JUNE 19, 2023",Japan’s vast wind and solar resources,"By far the fastest energy change in history is underway. Solar and wind generators comprise three quarters of global electricity generation capacity additions (Figure 1). This is compelling market-based evidence that solar and wind are cheaper than fossil fuel generation. Solar has been the leading technology since 2016 and may reach 60% of new generation capacity in 2023.

Japan could produce all of its electricity from wind and solar for $86/110 MWh, which is competitive with current market prices. This includes the cost of transmission and storage needed to balance 100% renewable electricity. Japan could set an example for the world.
Most Japanese emissions could be eliminated well before 2050 through the generation of zero-emission electricity from solar and wind, coupled with the electrification of transport, heating and industry. To achieve this, Japan’s current electricity consumption will need to double.
Japan has enormous and high quality offshore wind resources. Japan could generate about 50 times more electricity than current consumption using offshore wind sourced from its exclusive economic zone. This means that Japan can be very choosy about where it locates offshore wind farms, to harvest the highest wind speeds and minimize cost and environmental impact.
Japan’s solar potential is also large. It has the potential to produce four times its current consumption from solar panels located on rooftops, floating on inland water bodies and deployed in conjunction with agriculture. Japan’s population of 125 million is forecast to decline by 18% to 102 million by 2050, which could free up 18%, or 8000 km2 of its current agricultural land. This land alone would be enough to provide all of Japan’s energy requirements from solar energy.
Large-scale electrical energy storage to support solar and wind is a solved problem in the form of batteries (for storage of seconds to hours) and Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (for overnight and longer periods). ANU’s global pumped hydro atlas shows 2,400 good sites in Japan with a combined storage potential of 53 TWh. Only a few dozen sites are required to support a 100% renewable energy system.

Japan used to be a global renewable energy leader. Sadly, Japan is now lagging well behind pathfinder countries in terms of annual per capita deployment of new renewable energy. Netherlands, Sweden, Australia and Finland are installing solar and wind five times faster (per capita) than Japan, and China, Spain Germany and the USA are installing solar and wind twice as fast.
The Japanese government’s Clean Energy Strategy Interim Report lacks clear recognition of the crucial role of solar and wind in global decarbonization and, instead, it promotes nuclear energy, imported hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS). This is unlikely to be a good choice.
Global nuclear capacity has been static at about 400 GW since 2010. In 2022 the solar deployment rate was 200 Gigawatts, and it is rapidly growing every year. This is compelling evidence that nuclear is uncompetitive with solar.
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has achieved zero commercial success in the electricity industry. Solar PV and wind already have a compelling economic advantage over fossil fuel generation without CCS, as shown by their dominance of new power station deployment. Electricity from fossil-fuelled power stations will become even less competitive if they are equipped with CCS because of large capital cost and the parasitic energy costs of CCS.
Importation of clean hydrogen for energy production (for example from Australia) is expensive because about three-quarters of the energy is lost in compression, shipping, storage and conversion which triples the effective energy cost. It’s cheaper for Japan to produce its own electricity from wind and solar than to import clean hydrogen.
About 10 million electric cars were sold in 2023, compared with 20,000 hydrogen-powered vehicles. Japan’s export car industry is at risk due to a lack of focus on developing competitive models for the booming electric vehicle market.
Pathfinder countries in northern Europe and Australia are showing that it is straightforward to largely decarbonize the electricity system via solar and wind. Japan will need to step up its pace of deployment of wind and solar tenfold to decarbonize by mid-century.
With the right policies, Japan can look forward to a sustainable future in which it no longer imports oil, coal, gas or uranium. Unlimited energy can come from rooftop solar panels, solar farms and offshore wind turbines. This provides a high degree of energy independence and resilience in the face of a pandemic, war or trade disruption.
Key elements needed for industrial precursor chemicals, ammonia, plastics, synthetic jet fuel and many other materials are hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, sodium, chlorine and nitrogen. These are available everywhere from seawater and air. Japan’s chemical industry can be substantially self-sufficient, with driving energy coming from indigenous wind and solar.
Most buildings can have their own solar panels, energy storage, electric space and water heating, and electric vehicles. This eliminates greenhouse emissions, car exhausts, smog, oil spills, coal plant exhausts, ash dumps, nuclear accidents, and nuclear waste disposal. Japan can lock in cheap, clean, and highly reliable perpetual energy.
The old certainties of fossils are rapidly fading. The world is moving to solar and wind at a similar speed to digital photography’s displacement of film cameras. Hopefully, Japan does not have its very own Kodak moment.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/19/virtual-power-plants-roll-out-across-the-u-s/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 19, 2023",Virtual power plants roll out across the U.S.,"From pv magazine USA
VPP pilot programs have run for years in the United States. The market is maturing as the technology competes with centralized utility scale power plants as a low-cost alternative with benefits to the grid and end-users alike.
A VPP is a virtual aggregation of small-scale, distributed energy resources (DERs) including PV, energy storage, electric vehicle chargers, and demand-responsive devices such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances. VPP technology has shown immediate promise in replacing natural gas “peaker plants” on grids, offering additional capacity during times of peak electricity demand.
Over the last decade, the US has spent more than $120 billion on 100 GW of new generation capacity, mainly for resource adequacy. A study by Boston-based consultancy Brattle Group estimates utilities could save $35 billion by 2033 by focusing on VPPs for peaker capacity.
“By deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants,” says Jigar Shah, the director of the US Department of Energy (DoE) Loans Programs Office.
Brattle Group’s 400 MW resource adequacy study considered a utility with 1.7 million residential customers. The power company had 5.7 GW of gross peak demand and 3.6 GW of net peak demand from solar and wind resources. Its aim was to generate half its electricity from renewables by 2030. The study found VPP peaker usage would be 40% to 60% cheaper than alternatives, including gas peakers and grid-scale batteries.
Brattle Group estimated 60 GW of VPP deployment could meet US resource adequacy needs through 2033 for $15 billion to $35 billion less than the cost of alternatives. That level of VPP deployment could also provide more than $20 billion worth of emissions and resilience benefits over the decade.
“VPPs do more than provide decarbonization and grid services – they increasingly give grid operators a large scale and utility grade alternative to new generation and system buildout, through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives,” says Shah.
Project Hestia
The DoE Loan Programs Office has supported VPPs, recently proposing a $3 billion conditional loan to energy-as-a-service provider Sunnova to roll out its “Project Hestia” nationwide. The plan aims to increase solar and VPP service access for disadvantaged communities that could otherwise be unable to secure residential solar loans. Sunnova will receive indirect, partially guaranteed cash flows for loans backing customer accounts.
Eligible households must use Sunnova’s energy management system, accessible via smartphones or other electronic devices. The system will recommend demand response behavior, enabling customers to reduce energy costs while helping balance the grid during peak demand.
If issued, the DoE package would support loan origination for solar, storage, and other Sunnova adaptive home technology with VPP capability. The guarantees could drive up to $5 billion in loan originations, saving on interest and reducing the weighted average cost of capital.
“Project Hestia would make possible a historic private sector investment in disadvantaged American communities and energy infrastructure,” says Sunnova CEO William J. Berger.
Market tailwinds
Shifting US market conditions are further driving VPP adoption. The $369 billion of climate and energy spending in the Inflation Reduction Act includes many requirements for serving energy communities: disadvantaged communities crucial to an equitable energy transition. Projects in designated energy communities are eligible for an additional 10% investment tax credit, supplementing the 30% base credit for renewables projects.
Other states are beginning to follow California in trimming back or removing net energy metering (NEM), a rate mechanism instrumental in launching the US residential solar market. Older NEM rates offered customers the full retail value for every kilowatt-hour of electricity fed to the grid. California’s NEM 3.0 rate essentially kills the value of exported energy and other states will follow suit. Solar installers have warned this could prompt a market based on self-consumption from batteries, with resulting grid defection doing little to help network flexibility. VPPs, however, offer grid services including demand response, peak demand shaving, and more. Customers can be incentivized to trim energy use or export power during peak grid hours, making for a nimbler network.
Resilience
VPPs also reinforce grid resilience in zones affected by climate change-related extreme weather. Residential solar installer Sunrun has been selected to deploy a 17 MW network of solar-plus-storage VPPs in Puerto Rico.
In the wake of 2017’s Hurricane Maria, the Caribbean island’s government created a framework for DERs with 2019’s Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act.
Sunrun will enroll Puerto Rican customers this year to begin VPP operation next year. The company says customers will bank power cost savings and be compensated for offering battery storage capacity to the grid now run by US-Canadian joint venture LUMA Energy.
