The company said the new factory is planned to have an annual solar cell capacity of 20 GW and a battery capacity of 20 GW. Initially the factory will have a cell capacity of 5 GW and storage system capacity of 6 GW
The project requires an investment of CNY 11.6 billion ($1.67 billion), the company said without providing further details.
In February 2022, Shanghai Tianchen signed an agreement with Chinese module maker Huasun. The two companies said at the time they aimed to set up a joint venture for the development of heterojunction solar modules, with Tianchen securing an 80% stake in the new company and Huasun holding the remaining share.
In February this year, Huasun started manufacturing panels in Anhui at its HJT solar cell factory in Xuancheng. The new factory will have an annual capacity of 2.4 GW and will exclusively produce bifacial 182 mm HJT cells based on a cell tech with a power conversion efficiency of 25.26%.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/05/united-arab-emirates-solar-market/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED ARAB EMIRATES",,"MAY 5, 2023",United Arab Emirates’ solar market,"The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has made significant progress toward increasing its dependence on renewable energy in recent years, with the goal of increasing the share of clean energy in its total power mix to 50% by 2050. Currently, the UAE is one of the fastest-growing utility-scale markets in the Middle East and North Africa region, with approximately 2,000 MW of renewable energy being installed annually. However, there are still several challenges the country is facing to achieve its goals.
Romain Riche, international development director at the Middle East Solar Industry Association (MESIA), commented, “Over the last two years, due to the surge in PV module prices, major solar developers experienced delays for module delivery from China, slightly delaying flagship projects in the region. Due to those challenges, the country's cumulative installed capacity remains valued at around 3.5 GW by end 2022, but shall soon reach 6 GW capacity with the completion of the current mega-projects in Abu Dhabi (Al Dhafrah 1,500 MW) and Dubai (MBR Solar Park Phases 4 and 5, respectively 950 and 900 MW).”
With the implementation of programs like the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050, which aims to provide 75% of Dubai’s total power capacity from clean energy sources, and the Abu Dhabi Vision 2030, the nation has established lofty targets for the advancement of solar PV technology. “At the dawn of COP28 to be held in the country, new developments are likely to be announced. This year, EWEC will close the tendering of Al Aljban to add 1,500 MW of solar in Abu Dhabi. Dubai, meanwhile, is already getting 14% of its electricity from clean-energy sources and DEWA has now launched the tender of the sixth phase of its mega-solar cluster to add an additional 1,800 MW,” Rich added.
When it comes to the distributed solar segment, while it has been popular in Dubai with its net metering policy, overall its development remains limited. In order to reach the ambitious target of the UAE Energy Strategy 2050, with a clean energy share of 44% by 2050, accelerated development and updated policies are required.
The growth of solar energy in the UAE is also hampered by a number of factors, including legal and legislative concerns, funding constraints, and grid integration limitations. One such challenge is the lack of regulation for the distributed generation (DG) market in the UAE outside the Dubal emirate. However, in November 2021, the UAE announced its intention to adopt a federal law regulating the connection of distributed renewable energy production units to the electrical grid in all seven emirates. This is expected to greatly revitalise the DG market over the next few years, with an estimated annual increase of 400 to 500 MW annually once regulations are in place, compared to the current rate of around 60 to 100 MW annually. This will represent a significant leap for the DG market in the UAE.
In the utility-scale sector, the projects are primarily focused in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The consolidation of these utility-scale projects makes it very hard for local developers and EPCs to grow in the local utility-scale sector.
Despite these challenges, the International Renewable Energy Agency forecasts that by 2030, the nation may generate 25% of its electricity from solar energy and have a total installed solar capacity of 44 GW by 2050, very near its target. The UAE will need to continue its efforts to implement laws and programs to support the expansion of solar energy and meet these goals.

Absence of cavern storage potential did not hamper the significance of electrofuels but increased the role of ammonia and led to average 5.5 % systemic cost increase,” the researchers said in their paper “Impact of climate and geological storage potential on feasibility of hydrogen fuels,” published in Applied Energy. The term hemiboreal refers to areas halfway between the temperate and subarctic zones. In their optimization-based framework for centralized planning of energy systems relying on renewable power generation, the Finnish team found that “with the adopted cost assumptions electrolysis was a cost-efficient technology in all of the studied climates.” In almost all systems, hydrogen use for direct power generation was insignificant but important for sectors that are hard or expensive to electrify directly, the researchers found. The results also showed that in some regions where cavern storages are unavailable, liquid hydrogen could assume the role of energy storage.
Fusion Fuel entered into a €2.46 million ($2.71 million) equipment supply contract with Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) for a 550 kW solar-to-green hydrogen project in Zaragoza, Spain. The project comprises the development of on-premises green hydrogen production and dispensing system for mobility in Zaragoza, along with supplementary solar photovoltaic generation and an energy storage system. The project will be developed in cooperation with Zoilo Ríos service stations. Fusion Fuel will supply 22 of its HEVO-Solar units, along with the balance of plant equipment for water purification and hydrogen compression and storage to 500 bar. The company expects to deliver the equipment to the project in the third quarter of 2023. “Our business development team is focused on our core markets in Portugal and Spain as well as some of the priority markets that we have previously identified, like North America and Italy,” Fusion Fuel told pv magazine. The PEM electrolyzer technology company explained that they perceive a disconnect in terms of project execution and technology deployment. “We are making a concerted effort to focus more on actionable projects and to communicate them to market once they have reached a sufficient level of development.”
AW-Energy and Kaoko Green Energy Solutions have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for hydrogen production in Namibia. “The MoU is devoted to the development of renewable energy and aims to produce green hydrogen from renewable energy sources including wave energy,” said the near-shore wave energy technology company. Namibia enjoys an “energetic and consistent wave resource,” added AW-Energy CEO Christopher Ridgewell.
CWP Global and Hydrogenious LOHC Technologies have signed an MoU for a joint feasibility study in 2023 that will explore a 500-tons-per-day hydrogen transport chain from Morocco to Europe using Hydrogenious' liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) technology. “The 15 GW AMUN project near the city of Tan Tan in Morocco will be explored as a starting point in the feasibility study. This project is focused on producing ammonia locally from green hydrogen to support the decarbonization of fertilizer and maritime shipping,” said the German LOHC technology company. 
Nikola Corporation and Voltera signed a definitive agreement to develop up to 50 hydrogen refueling stations throughout North America over the next five years. “This partnership underpins Nikola's prior announced plans to develop 60 stations by 2026,” wrote the transportation company. Voltera will site, build, own, and operate the stations, while Nikola will supply the hydrogen fuel and provide technical expertise.
EWE and Salzgitter signed a declaration of intent to cooperate in the hydrogen sector. “As part of the planned cooperation, EWE and Salzgitter have agreed that EWE will produce and supply green hydrogen, which Salzgitter will use for virtually CO2-free steel production,” said the Oldenburg-based energy service provider.

However, for much of Western and Central Europe, irradiance was below average, with parts of Ukraine being as much as 40 percent below average. Solar power production on the Iberian Peninsula exceeded 12 GW on most days of the month, which was a significant proportion of the peak of around 60 GW for available Europe-wide figures for the month.

Weather conditions in Europe for April were consistent with the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation. This climate phenomenon is associated with anomalously low surface pressures over Western Europe. This manifested as stronger low-pressure systems and associated frontal passages across Western and Central Europe. These brought more clouds, which reduced solar irradiance across countries, including France, Germany and Poland. Impacts were greatest for Ukraine, which experienced heavy rainfall and flooding.
Conversely, over the Iberian Peninsula, as well as in northern zones around Finland, higher than average surface pressures were observed. These brought a greater than usual incidence of clear sky conditions conducive for solar production.
 
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2 km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.

The company said the Ovra Solara Magriel project will be located on an 80,000 m2 surface at an altitude of 2,100 m. “The mountain railway to the Disentis ski area can meet their annual electricity requirements for operation entirely with local solar power,” Axpo said in a statement. “The utilization of the existing infrastructure, such as the power grid, simplifies the construction of the solar plant.”
Construction on the facility is scheduled for the spring of 2024, with completion being planned for the fall of 2026. ” Another 10 MW ground-mounted plant will be built as of the fall of 2025 in the town of Tujetsch near the Nalps reservoir in the Canton of Grisons,” the company added.
Axpo commissioned its first alpine PV project in September, a 2.2 MW PV system on the Muttsee Dam, at an altitude of almost 2,500 meters above sea level.
The Swiss energy company secured a power purchase agreement from supermarket chain Denner for the project in January 2022. The deal was the first bilateral agreement for an unsubsidized solar project in Switzerland.
In September 2022, Switzerland made amendments to its Energy Act focusing on urgent measures to secure power supply in winter. The new federal law aims to enable and facilitate the construction of large-scale ground-mounted PV systems in the Swiss Alps, 1,500 meters or higher above sea level.
The Swiss government is expected to provide subsidies for up to 60% of the installation costs of eligible projects. To classify for the subsidy, the projects must show a winter yield of at least 500 kWh/kW.
The Swiss government aims to reach 2 TWh of alpine PV production with the incentive scheme.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/05/energy-transition-wont-work-without-ess/,"SPONSORED,WORLD",,"MAY 5, 2023",Energy transition won’t work without ESS,"Efforts to build the applications and infrastructure to generate energy from renewables are complemented by the work being done to connect these technologies to the grid and guarantee a smooth energy supply 24/7. With the volatile energy supply from renewables such as wind, solar, and hydropower, ESS can help stabilize the grid by smoothing out energy supply and demand fluctuations. This will reduce the need for costly grid upgrades and improve overall grid efficiency.
To support the energy transition, modern energy storage solutions for PV plants enable the integration of renewable energy sources that are intermittent in nature. By storing excess energy generated during daylight, it can be used later when there is low production. In the event of outages or periods of high demand, ESS products can deliver solid backup power and support the balance of the electricity grid.
With OpEx- and CapEx-optimized products, ESS technology helps to reduce energy costs by reducing peak demand charges and providing energy during times of high energy prices. ESS also offers environmental benefits: Energy storage can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by enabling greater use of renewable energy sources and reducing the need for fossil fuel-fired power plants.
With more than 10 years of experience in BESS and 7 GWh shipped just in 2022, Sungrow is a forerunner in the utility-scale energy storage market.
As of right now, the price of polysilicon ─ a key raw material used in the production of solar cells ─ is on a downward trend and the decreasing cost of solar-generated energy storage will make the investment very attractive in the near future. For example, for a project of 50 MW / 100MWh using the PowerTitan liquid-cooled ESS by Sungrow, the total system cost (LCOS) can be reduced by about 20% percent.
In Israel, Sungrow has already installed multiple PowerTitans on an 88 MWh BESS plant. The utility-scale energy storage system will improve the efficiency of the gas turbine plant and reduce the runtime of the turbines, allowing generators to be turned down quickly and improving the speed and flexibility of their response. The plant produces 10% of the Israeli energy demand. Liquid cooling enables cells to have a more uniform temperature throughout the system while using less input energy, eliminating overheating, maintaining safety, minimizing degradation, and enabling higher performance.
Another recently signed ESS contract in Israel is covering an additional pipeline of several hundred MWh for Doral Energy. “Sungrow is one of Israel's key energy storage solution suppliers, contributing to local net-zero carbon ambition,” said Tzvi Ben David, General Manager of Sungrow Israel.
According to the BloombergNEF Energy Storage Market Outlook published in 2022, larger and longer-duration projects highlight the scale-up of energy storage use cases in EMEA.
Sungrow recently announced its cooperation for UK’s longest-duration BESS project.  The biggest (to date) UK solar-plus-storage plant was completed in 2020 using Sungrow ESS’ in Wiltshire and is already generating and storing 100 MW/100 MWh for the local grid.
Another new large-scale storage project with 20 MW/20 MWh is now being built with the Scandinavian Capacity Reserve (SCR). It is located in Landskrona, southern Sweden, and will provide ancillary services to help balance the grid for Landskrona Energi AB.
Germany is also now entering the green storage market, with the first Sungrow DC-coupled solar plus (large-scale) storage project using Sungrow’s liquid-cooled solution. The project, with a capacity of 3.125 MW/5.5 MWh, was agreed upon in March 2023.
Historically, the EU's energy demand has been growing but at a slower rate than in the past due to various factors, such as energy efficiency improvements, changes in industrial structure, and policies promoting renewable energy sources. The EU has set ambitious goals to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, which will require a significant transformation of its energy system. According to the European Commission's Energy Outlook 2050, the energy demand in the EU is projected to continue to decline gradually over the coming decades.
The Commission has also established a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. To achieve this goal, the EU will need to accelerate the transition to a decarbonized energy system. This transition will involve a shift away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydropower, as well as improvements in energy efficiency and the adoption of new technologies.
Any effort to use renewable energy, leading to the abandonment of nuclear power and fossil fuels, will create a future for this planet and its inhabitants, animals, and plants ─ so efforts to protect the earth's limited resources are urgently needed. Sungrow offers a range of leading technologies for this purpose and is working toward the goal of carbon dioxide-free production by 2028. Sungrow’s corporate social responsibility is underscored by its membership in the RE100 and EP100 initiatives (see the latest sustainability report 2021).
Being a strong supporter and an active doer in responding to global climate change, Sungrow has always adhered to the mission of “Clean power for all” and will continue to advance the deep integration of business and sustainability. By strengthening the development and utilization of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency, companies from all sectors vigorously contribute to global pollution reduction and carbon reduction.

This algorithm consists of a distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library that can help accurately predict a target variable by combining an ensemble of estimates from a set of simpler and weaker models.
“We further dive into the modeling detail of XGBoost and decompose its enhanced prediction performance over logistic regression into two factors: variable interaction and nonlinearity,” the scientists said. “We last show the potential of XGBoost in reducing customer acquisition costs, and then the ability to identify new market opportunities for PV companies.”
According to them, this new methodology could help solar companies lower customer acquisition costs and other soft costs associated with the residential PV business.
They compared the performance of the proposed algorithm with the logistic regression approach, which the researchers described as the most commonly used method to analyze differences between PV adopters and non-adopters. “Our logistic regression model with nine original and highly visible household features successfully predicts 71% of out-of-sample PV adoption statuses,” they further explained. “The model correctly identified 66% of adopters and 75% of non-adopters.”
The adapted algorithm, according to the research group, was able to offer better results than the logistic regression in predictive performance. “The predictive model correctly predicted 87% of the two PV adoption statuses, compared to 71% for logistic regression,” they added. “The correct adopter rate increased from 66 to 87% and the correct non-adopter rate increased from 75 to 88%.”
They attributed the superior performance of the machine learning-based approach to the fact that it integrates complex nonlinearity and variable interaction and considers factors such as summer bills, household income, and homeowner’s age, among others.
“The advantage of using these variables is that they are highly accessible so that PV companies can collect data on them with little cost,” they also note. “Another reason to explain the improved performance of XGBoost is that it can potentially recover key latent information embedded in the data. “For example, including geographical information such as the state or county of the respondent increases the prediction accuracy of logistic regression to some extent.”
The research group estimated that the novel methodology can help PV companies reduce customer acquisition costs by about 15% or $0.07/Watt. It also explained that data mining and machine learning could also help reduce soft costs for contract cancellation, supply chain management, labor assignment, and permitting and inspection issues.
It described the new methodology in the study “Machine learning reduces soft costs for residential solar photovoltaics,” published in scientific reports. The research group is formed by scientists coming from the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Florida State University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the Renmin University of China.

The market traded sideways for the week with several Asian countries, including China, on a brief hiatus for the May 1 Labor Day holiday.

Lower-than-expected overseas demand helped to keep CMM at multi-week low but price movements were again mixed across the rest of the photovoltaic chain with the Global Polysilicon Marker (GPM), OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon produced outside of China, falling 3.01% week on week to $35.831/kg.
Despite the falling raw material costs, expectations of firm domestic demand in China might have helped to offset the subdued overseas demand for modules, allowing sellers to resist lowering their offers for FOB China modules.
The price spread between FOB China module and FOB China M10 cell however remained at a narrow $0.084/W on May 2, an over 30% drop from a high of $0.123/W on January 12 (see chart). The spread has stayed under $0.10/W since January 31, suggesting sliding margins for non-integrated module producers.

The additive, which they described as “multifunctional and non-volatile,” consists of a molecule known as 4-guanidinobenzoic acid hydrochloride (GBAC), which is a raw material and intermediate commonly utilized in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and dyestuff fields.
“This molecule can also serve as an effective defect passivation linker in the annealed perovskite film due to its non-volatility, resulting in significantly reduced non-radiative recombination loss and improved film quality,” the academics explained, noting that, through its addition, a hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate phase is formed and high-quality perovskite films can be achieved.
The device has a p–i–n structure and showed considerably reduced defect density on the perovskite film, which in turn results in reduced non-radiative recombinations.
The cell achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 24.8% and certified efficiency of 24.5%, with the Japan Electrical Safety & Environment Technology Laboratories (JET) confirming the result. “The overall energy loss of the device was reduced to 0.36 eV, representing one of the lowest energy losses among the perovskite PV devices with high power conversion efficiency,” the scientists added.
The cell was also able to retain 98% of its initial efficiency for over 1,000 hours under continuous heating at around 65 C in a nitrogen-filled glovebox.
The scientists also built a larger area device of 1 cm2 with this cell technology and the new cell achieved an efficiency of 22.7%, which they say shows the technology is fully scalable. “This effective approach can also be applied to wide-bandgap perovskites and large-area devices to show reduced voltage loss and high efficiency,” they said.
They published their findings in the paper “Hydrogen-bond-bridged intermediate for perovskite solar cells with enhanced efficiency and stability,” published in nature photonics.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/05/california-utilities-commission-sued-for-gouging-rooftop-solar-payments/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 5, 2023",California utilities commission sued for gouging rooftop solar payments,"From pv magazine USA
A coalition of three environmental groups has filed a lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for instituting a rulemaking decision that rapidly and sharply slashes payments to rooftop solar owners for exporting clean energy to the grid. 
The Environmental Working Group, the Protect our Communities Coalition and the Center for Biological Diversity filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal to review the state’s new Net Energy Metering 3.0 policy. 
In December 2022, CPUC decided to pass NEM 3.0, reducing payments for exported solar energy by up to 80%. 
The petition said the rulemaking violates the state’s climate laws and improperly evaluates the many benefits of small-scale, distributed solar on rooftops, while ignoring the billions of dollars utilities spend on transmission infrastructure that drives increased rates. Benefits of rooftop solar include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, resilience to extreme weather and power outages, and avoided land use impacts by decreasing the need for utility transmission infrastructure which also keeps electricity bills down.
The lawsuit directly names the three large investor-owned utility companies, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas and Electric Company, as the real parties in interest.
The decision adopted an investor-owned utility-developed avoided cost calculator to set rates. NEM 3.0 was implemented on April 15, and has worsened the return on investment for rooftop solar, particularly when not paired with energy storage. 
The state was the tip of the spear for the rooftop solar industry across the United States, representing about 50% of the market, and now that spear is blunted. Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) project that new residential solar installations in California are expected to decrease by nearly 40% through 2024, after doubling in 2020 to 2022.
“The commission’s misguided new policy violates California’s climate laws and will stifle rooftop solar growth, especially for working-class families,” said Roger Lin, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “It’s outrageous that the commission is slow-walking our renewable energy transition when we need to be racing toward it.”
The petitioners said NEM 3.0 contained numerous legal errors and false assumptions, and that the Court must reverse the decision, grant review, and remand the issue with instructions to comply with the legislature's requirements to fully and properly evaluate NEM’s costs and benefits.
Why cut solar? 
The petition highlights methods utilities are using across the country to block rooftop solar as distributed energy resources threaten the utility profiteering. A report from the Center for Biological Diversity evaluates rooftop solar and net-metering benefits and why corporate utility companies are trying to kill these programs.
The rulemaking decision was justified based on an analysis that suggested non-rooftop solar customers were subsidizing their neighbors that decided to invest in the clean energy transition.
However, this utility-forwarded cost shift argument has been debunked. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory found that 47 states have a negligible solar power cost shift. Most states have solar penetration levels far below 10%. Until you hit that level of penetration there’s no cost shift altogether, yet states across the country are following California’s footsteps in slashing net metering.
Even at penetration levels of 10% or higher, the national laboratory found that the “shift” is only 5/1,000 of a cent per kilowatt-hour. Sixteen state-level analyses have come to the same conclusion that the cost shift is negligible.
“If the goal is to keep prices low, there are other pieces of the puzzle that affect rates far more than net metering,” Galen L. Barbose, a research scientist at LBNL, echoing a study by LBNL which put this in context. “Carbon pricing, operating outdated plants—those are the issues utilities and regulators should be focused on.”
More trouble ahead
What’s more, the state’s Public Advisor’s Office (PAO), following state procedures that require it to equitably balance the resource cost demands of the major investor-owned utilities, has recommended a fixed utility bill fee for all Californians based on income.
PAO’s recommendation assigns customers with fixed monthly fees between $22 per month and $42 per month, while some utility proposals under review would assess fees as high as $128 per month for California residents. This proposal would even apply to rooftop solar customers who consume zero electricity from the grid.
“In just about every case, if you are a low electricity user today, with a relatively low bill, you are going to see a higher bill once this plan is in place,” said Ahmad Faruqui, economist-at-large, grid controls expert and California resident. 
“Customers will be very irritated,” said Faruqui. “They will be paying more for electricity not because their behavior changed but because California is changing the rules.”
