The new platform manages and optimizes the EV charging process for sites that require dynamic load management and have large quantities of EVs, such as apartment buildings, workplaces, and public charging locations. Built on AI-based predictive algorithms, the solution incorporates real-time data analytics and considers solar production, dynamic electricity prices, and tiered charging schedules.
The solution is powered by technology developed by Wevo Energy, a startup specializing in EV charging optimization and management software, in which SolarEdge is an investor. Wevo Energy’s software is said to be already deployed at thousands of parking spaces globally.
By integrating with SolarEdge’s energy management system, the new platform orchestrates and optimizes interactions between onsite solar generation, stationary battery storage, and large-scale EV charging, taking into account grid and infrastructure limitations.
“As more companies are taking active measures to electrify their car fleets, combining solar PV and EV charging is a cost-effective and sustainable way to manage these fleets,” said Zvi Lando, CEO of SolarEdge Technologies. “We believe SolarEdge C&I PV solutions, combined with Wevo's advanced EV charging management capabilities, will help businesses use energy more economically and sustainably.”
The solution will initially be launched in Germany and the United Kingdom, with plans to quickly expand to other markets.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/05/uk-heat-pump-owners-satisfied-with-performance-in-old-houses/,"HEAT PUMPS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JUNE 5, 2023",Survey shows UK heat pump owners satisfied with performance in old homes,"Nesta, a UK-based charity supporting innovation, commissioned a large-scale survey on heat pump users in England, Scotland, and Wales in December 2022. It surveyed more than 2,500 residential heat pump owners and over 1,000 domestic gas boilers about how satisfied they are with their heating systems.
Its analysis of the survey finds that among people who have had heat pumps installed while living in their current homes, 81% are as satisfied or more satisfied, compared to their previous heating systems. The figure is similar for heat pump owners in pre-1900 Victorian properties, at 83%.
Nesta said that similar levels of satisfaction across property type and age suggests that heat pumps are likely to be effective across the range of residential property types in Great Britain.
“It’s time to put to rest outdated ideas that older homes don’t support heat pumps,” said Madeleine Gabriel, director of sustainable future at Nesta. “The rollout of heat pumps across all property types in Britain is proving that the age of your house doesn’t have to be a big factor when deciding whether to get a greener heating system.”
The survey also shows that satisfaction levels between heat pump and gas boiler users are high and very similar. Nesta says heat pump owners are particularly likely to prefer their heat pumps if they previously used electric heating, oil, or liquid petroleum gas (LPG) boilers. Of these users, more than 80% said that they are more satisfied with their heat pumps, whereas 75% of users moving from gas boilers said they are more satisfied with their heat pumps.
Regarding running costs, Nesta reports higher satisfaction among heat pump users, with 67% of heat pump owners and 59% of gas boiler owners expressing satisfaction. However, heat pump users showed lower satisfaction with ease of use and control compared to gas boiler users. About 74% of heat pump users said that they are fairly or very satisfied, in contrast to 88% of gas boiler users.
Finally, the survey showed that satisfaction is highest among people who have chosen to install heat pumps in their own homes, rather than those moving into new builds or existing properties with heat pumps.
“The survey suggests that heat pump ‘inheritors’ – who move into homes with heat pumps already installed – would benefit from more information on how to use their systems, as many had very little awareness of heat pumps before moving into their properties,” concluded Nesta.

They achieved this by depositing a titanium oxide (TiO2) sponge on the device to prevent potential lead (Pb) leakage.
“We conceived the solar cell for applications in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and agrivoltaics, where the potential lead leakage can be viewed as a serious public environmental and health risk source,” researcher Salvatore Valastro told pv magazine.
TiO2, a highly adsorbent material, serves as an effective electron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cells. To address potential lead (Pb) leakage, the researchers created a solvent-free porous TiO2 film, forming a sponge-like structure capable of capturing Pb from damaged cells during simulated catastrophic events.
“The TiO2 sponge can sequester Pb in concentrations ranging from 24 g cm2 to 63 g cm2, which are equivalently contained in MAPbI3 layers with thicknesses from 200 nm (semi-transparent PSC) to 500 nm (opaque PSC),” the researchers explained.
They built the cell with a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), a hole transport layer (HTL) made of poly-triarylamine (PTAA), a perovskite absorber with the TIO2 sponge, an electron acceptor made of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, a gold (Au) metal contact, and the TIO2 sponge.
“We deposited the sponge via a physical solvent-free deposition, by using sputtering equipment, an easily up-scalable deposition method, which is widely used by semiconductors manufacturing companies,” Valastro said. “A pre-sputtering step of 1 min is performed before the deposition process to clean up the surface of the titanium target to remove oxidized layers.”
The solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 11.6% and has an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 31.4%. “The efficiency value of 11.6% is characteristic of this semi-transparent architecture,” said Valastro.
The research team described the cell tech in “Preventing lead leakage in perovskite solar cells with a sustainable titanium dioxide sponge,” which was recently published in Nature Sustainability.
“Our method represents a concrete step forward in addressing Pb release for BIPV, BAPV, agrivoltaics and opaque devices, and also paves the way for Pb recycling in end-of-life devices,” the team concluded.

Under the agreement, EN.IT commits to the installation of a new wind farm in Rio Grande do Sul that will supply green hydrogen and 250,000 tons of green ammonia per year through renewable energy.
This is the fifth MOU signed between the Brazilian government and private companies for the development of green hydrogen projects. It represents a further step in the direction of decarbonization and hydrogen production through renewable sources – as established by the bill PL 725 of 2022, regulating the integration of hydrogen as an energy source in Brazil – and establishes incentive parameters for the use of sustainable hydrogen.
For EN.IT, the Brazilian project represents only the first step in the company’s dawn2zero initiative, which is a dedicated platform for global investments in the field of the green hydrogen and its hydrogen-based fuels and feedstocks. The platform will include high-selected world-scale green hydrogen production projects up to 5 GW by 2035 to support the transition toward zero-carbon emissions in traditional hydrogen sectors (chemicals, oil refining, iron, and steel) and new potential markets, such as the aviation, buildings and power sectors.
EN.IT CEO Mattia D’Amato, who is also Co-Founder and CEO of dawn2zero, says that due to the many uses and applications of green hydrogen and ammonia, “demand is expected to increase greatly from now through 2050. Our first initiative in Brazil will produce 250,000 tons of green ammonia per year, avoiding approximately 400,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year. Ammonia has a wide variety of potential applications, including as a power generator, hydrogen carrier and zero carbon fuel. Furthermore, it can be used in industrial processes and to produce fertilizers and can also be converted back to hydrogen through cracking technologies. In this way, we can store and transport hydrogen using existing infrastructure. The main goal for the green ammonia we produce is to be used both in the local market and international markets, including Europe, where we can make a significant contribution to worldwide green energy targets and help to build a foundation for a future net-zero carbon economy.”
To date, EN.IT, with 30-years of experience, has completed approximately 1 GW of renewable energy projects developed in Italy and has a pipeline of more than 5 GW of projects under development worldwide. D’Amato adds, “For us, the signing of this memorandum represents, on the one hand, a milestone within our long-term development project and, on the other, recognizes EN.IT's status as a reliable partner of both government authorities and industrial players on the path to global decarbonization. Today producing clean energy is no longer a luxury, it’s the only way forward. The dawn2zero platform, through the involvement of strategic partners, will give effective solutions to global climate changes. Let’s improve the future of energy, starting today.”

The inverter and energy storage manufacturer offers the ASG-TL series in five versions, with power outputs from 5 kW to 12 kW.
“The three-phase hybrid solar inverters can greatly reduce electricity bill via power output limitation, peak and valley arbitrage mode, and effectively improve self-consumption,” Auxsol says on its website.
The transformerless inverters have dimensions of 540 mm x 420 mm x 218 mm and weigh 31.5 kg. They have efficiency ratings of 97.8%, European efficiency ratings of 97%, and feature two maximum power point tracking (MPPT) points.
The MPPT voltage range is 200 V to 900 V, with a maximum PV power input of 18 kW for the 12 kW inverters and 7.5 kW for the 5 kW devices. The maximum input voltage is 1,000 V.
Operating within a temperature range of -30 C to 60 C, the inverters have IP66-rated protection. They come with lithium-ion batteries that have voltages ranging from 200 V to 800 V, supporting a maximum charge/discharge current of 30 A.

One of the common problems is the overheating of solar cells, and the challenge is to find a low-cost, yet efficient cooling technique.
Now researchers from the Mohamed First University and the Green Energy Park in Morocco have investigated and quantified the effect of wind as a natural cooling agent under a hot arid climate. They exposed a 300 W polycrystalline PV module for six months (during the hot period of the year) in Benguerir, mid-south of Morocco, and measured the module's electrical parameters together with the meteorological data using high-quality sensors.
Their results showed that, even in a hot desert climate, the wind has a positive effect on reducing the PV module temperature, improving electrical production as well as conversion efficiency.
Their data showed that the reduction in module temperature (i.e., the cooling performance) varies from 1.12 °C to 14.48 °C for wind speed going from 1 m/s to 5.8 m/s. This leads to a gain in the power output ranging from 0.12% to 7.18%, and an enhancement in the module's efficiency from 0.04% to 6.45%.
Specifically, a wind speed increase of 5.8 m/s results in a PV temperature drop of 12 °C, leading to an increase in power production and conversion efficiency by 7.2% and 6.5%, respectively.
Additionally, the study evaluated the impact of wind direction and demonstrated that windward blowing (southerly winds) facing the front surface of the PV panel exhibit a more efficient cooling effect than leeward blowing (northerly winds), resulting in a temperature drop of 13 °C.
They presented their findings in the paper “Experimental Investigation on the Effect of Wind as a Natural Cooling Agent for Photovoltaic Power Plants in Desert Location,” published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering.
“These results may be important under the pretext that they may provide a good idea for the engineers to better select the hosting site of the PV power plants including wind speed and direction as a criterion, and also to better design the PV power plants in hot arid climates to take advantage from the winds and enhance the profitability and the lifetime of this last,” they concluded.

Delft University researchers have found that temperature and pressure are the main limitations for variable operation in PV-powered electrolysis systems. They said that the electrical response of water electrolyzers is not a concern. “The practical solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of these systems is in the range of 10% even with a very high coupling factor exceeding 99% for directly coupled systems,” they wrote in “Dynamic operation of water electrolyzers: A review for applications in photovoltaic systems integration.” They said that incorporating a battery could enhance solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, although it might increase the cost. They also said that the intermittency of solar irradiance, rather than its variability, poses the biggest challenge for PV-hydrogen systems in terms of operation and degradation.
Canadian researchers have identified key characteristics of cost-efficient H2 liquefaction systems, including higher production rates (>100 ton/day), higher efficiency (>40%), lower specific energy consumption (<6 kWh/kgLH2), and lower investment costs (1-2 $/kgLH2). In their review of methods to enhance liquefaction performance, the team highlights challenges faced by liquid H2 storage systems, such as high specific energy consumption (SEC), low energy efficiency, high cost, and boil-off gas losses. They propose solutions like an ACC, an ejector refrigeration cycle, LN2/LNG/LAC energy recovery, CRCs, and a mixed refrigerant system. The review, published by the American Chemical Society, also suggests integration with other hybrid structures and optimization algorithms.
European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson and German Minister for Economic Affairs Robert Habeck have discussed linking the new European Hydrogen Bank with Germany's H2Global initiative to enhance the global hydrogen expansion. In a joint statement, they said that H2Global will be open to all EU governments interested in hydrogen tenders and highlighted plans for a joint European auction, in collaboration with the European Hydrogen Bank, to contribute to international hydrogen imports
Ireland and Germany have formalized their collaboration in green hydrogen through a joint declaration of intent, allowing for future expansion. Ireland, with its abundant wind resources, is developing a National Hydrogen Strategy, which will soon be finalized. “Hydrogen represents one of the best ways of capturing these resources and sharing them with European partners including Germany,” said Irish Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan.
The Mukran project partners have started developing new mobile hydrogen storage systems. They are working on two spherical accumulators with different material compositions: one made of steel alloys and another with a steel inner layer and a carbon fiber-reinforced plastic outer shell. The researchers aim to achieve cost savings, durability, and improved recyclability through these material choices. The project is part of the TransHyDE hydrogen lead project, which is funded with approximately €19 million ($20.3 million) by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).
TES has partnered with TotalEnergies to develop the first large-scale e-natural gas (e-NG) production unit in the United States. The project, using renewable hydrogen and CO2, aims to produce 100,000 to 200,000 metric tons of e-NG per year. The partners will equally own and operate the project, with TotalEnergies and TES conducting preliminary studies and targeting a Final Investment Decision (FID) in 2024.

Brisbane-based battery maker Redflow will build a 20 MWh zinc-based battery energy storage system as part of a large-scale solar and storage project planned for northern California after securing AUD 18 million ($12 million) in funding from the California Energy Commission.
The 20 MWh battery energy storage system will be paired with a 5 MW solar installation as part of a $50 million renewable energy microgrid which will provide power for the Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians in northern California.
Redflow said it will supply, supervise installation and assist with the commissioning and maintenance of 2,000 of its 10 kWh 48 V ZBM3 batteries in modular energy pods. Shipping of the 200 kWh pods, to be manufactured in Redflow’s factory in Thailand, is expected to begin later this year with practical completion and commissioning of the system expected in 2025.
Redflow Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Tim Harris said the 20 MWh system is the company’s largest single sale and deployment of batteries to date and is an important step in the execution of the company’s plans to expand into the US market.
“This 20 MWh project is one of several large-scale opportunities in our pipeline and represents the start of the next phase of our growth strategy, validating our focus on large-scale systems in the U.S. and Australia,” he said. “The market for long-duration energy storage solutions is rapidly accelerating and this project will firmly establish Redflow’s presence in California, which is leading the development and support of non-lithium technologies to achieve its net-zero goals.”
California, which is targeting more than 400% growth in clean energy in the next two decades, is expected to require 45 GW to 55 GW of long-duration energy storage by 2045 to support grid stability and the state’s clean energy transition targets.
Harris said the new microgrid project follows on from the 2 MWh system that Redflow installed in California for biowaste tech company Anaergia in 2022 that has been successfully operating for more than a year.
Harris said Redflow’s zinc-bromine flow technology is capable of providing up to 12 hours of flexible energy capacity for both commercial and utility-scale energy storage applications.
“For this project, Redflow’s battery system is designed to charge from solar and discharge throughout the remainder of the day, reducing grid demand and boosting the energy security of the Paskenta Rancheria,” he said.
The project will be funded by the California Energy Commission’s long-duration energy storage grant program which is supporting the development of non-lithium technologies to help the state government achieve its net-zero goals.
Faraday Microgrids, a California developer and contractor that has deployed a number of California Energy Commission grant-funded microgrid projects, is the grant recipient and project lead, and will purchase the battery system from Redflow.
Faraday Microgrids CEO David Bliss said the “resiliency, operational performance, and safety” of Redflow’s zinc-bromine flow battery technology will play a key role in providing greater “energy sovereignty” for both California and the Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians.
“Redflow’s strength of team, innovative approach to flow technology, and a strong track record of successful deployments is a welcome addition to our microgrid portfolio,” he said.
Faraday expects the definitive supply agreement will be formalised and a notice to commence issued to Redflow around the end of July 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/05/saltwater-redox-flow-battery-with-integrated-ultracapacitor/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"JUNE 5, 2023",Saltwater redox flow battery with integrated ultracapacitor,"US-based startup Salgenx has integrated ultracapacitors with its saltwater redox flow batteries (SRFBs), resulting in enhanced power response, increased efficiency, and improved energy density.
The company unveiled its scalable SRFB earlier this year. The system features two separate tanks of electrolytes, one of which is regular saltwater. It does not use any lithium or vanadium and is membrane-free, unlike other flow batteries, thus promising big gains at the levelized cost of storage level.
The company claims that material costs of $5/kWh, $257kWh for system infrastructure, and a total system cost of $500,000, or $166/kW for the 3,000 kWh battery. The technology purportedly has a life expectancy of more than 25 years and a round trip efficiency of 91% at 10 mA/cm². With 125.7 Wh/L, its energy density outstrips that of most other flow battery solutions available today.
The Salgenx system circulates saltwater and a proprietary electrolyte through electrodes, which regulate the input and output of electricity from the battery. The battery is said to be suitable for an array of applications including grid scale power storage (both standalone or with solar or wind power), demand support, grid arbitrage, microgrid deployment, voltage and frequency regulation, co-generation, electric vehicle charging stations, and desalination, as well as thermal storage.
Now, with the integration of ultracapacitors, SRFBs are expected to deliver even greater benefits. The integrated system is said to ensure rapid power output within milliseconds, compensating for the slower response time of SRFBs and significantly boosting the overall power output of systems.
With the addition of ultracapacitors, the SRFB system is now able to efficiently handle short-duration high-power demands, according to Salgenx. This increased efficiency extends the lifespan of the SRFB and enhances the overall performance of the system.
SRFBs are known for their high energy density, while ultracapacitors excel in power density. Therefore, SRFB provides long-duration energy storage, while the ultracapacitors supplement it with high-power bursts when needed, resulting in a more comprehensive energy storage solution, according to the manufacturer.
“The successful integration of ultracapacitors with SRFBs will be a significant milestone for Salgenx and the renewable energy industry as a whole,” said Greg Giese, CEO of Salgenx.

It said global renewable capacity additions are set to soar by 107 GW to more than 440 GW in 2023 – the largest absolute increase ever. Solar will remain the main source of global renewable capacity expansion in 2023, accounting for 65% of growth or 286 GW, with distributed generation applications accounting for almost half of the expansion.
“Lower module prices, greater distributed PV system uptake and a policy push for large-scale deployment trigger higher annual additions in all major markets including China, the European Union, the United States, and India,” said the IEA.
However, the agency said that capacity additions will decrease in Brazil from 2023 to 2024, due to Law 14.300 entering into force in early 2022, changing remuneration rates for the distributed generation market. It revised its forecast for renewable capacity additions for 2023 and 2024 upwards by 38% compared to its predictions in December 2021.
“In the European Union, residential and commercial solar PV systems account for 74% of the increase to our forecast, with the majority (82%) of the rise coming from six key markets: Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Italy, and Sweden,” it added.
The two main trends driving the revised forecast are the increasingly attractive business case for self-consumption since January 2021 and the market conditions triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to the IEA.
The agency said that it also increased its forecast for utility-scale growth, but to a much lesser extent due to permitting challenges, unsubscribed auctions, and long development timelines. Competitive auctions are expected to remain the leading procurement method in Europe, accounting for at least 65% renewable capacity growth between 2022 and 2024.
“Almost half of this growth will be from auctions for two-way fixed contracts for difference, led by Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain,” said the IEA.
Power purchase agreements (PPAs) and merchant plants are expected to account for 22% of Europe’s capacity expansion until 2024. Corporate PPAs will account for most unused projects, led by Spain, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Some unsubsidized projects are also likely to emerge in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Poland, according to the IEA.
“While installations being developed on a fully merchant model are likely to constitute a minority, PPA projects are expected to stack revenues by combining a merchant tail,” it added.

The scientists dubbed the proposed combination hybrid solid gravity energy storage system (HGES) and said this technology may find applications in both distribution and transmission grids, while solving the technical problems of GES by avoiding repeated starting and stopping of the motor, which could cause losses and significant fluctuations in output power. “Various possible system structure schemes for the proposed HGES have been investigated,” the research's corresponding author, Wenxuan Tong, told pv magazine.
In the proposed system configuration, the GES unit is coupled with a power-based storage module. The GES unit is used to absorb excess power from the grid or release power when demand in the grid exceeds production, while the power-based module provides rated power in order to compensate for the fluctuating active power during the operation of the GES system.
The composition of the HGES depends on the type of motor used, the electric drive equipment, the grid access method, and the power-based energy storage access position. “From the perspective of system structural composition, HGES can be divided into mechanical systems, motors, electrical drive systems, grid access systems, and power-based energy storage systems,” the scientists explained.
They also explained that the proper functioning of the HGES system relies heavily on the control of power electronics, noting that different control strategies should be applied in different situations to achieve the best-integrated control effect. Furthermore, they said control strategies should also be implemented at the single-type energy storage system and hybrid energy storage system level.
The academics conducted a series of simulations via Simulink (MATLAB) and found that the proposed system is able to meet their theoretical expectations. “The power-based energy storage in the hybrid gravity storage system can well suppress the inherent power fluctuation problem of GES under the rectangular-based compensation strategy,” they emphasized. “The response speed of the HGES is improved by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to the single GES system.”
Furthermore, they claim the system may achieve an efficiency of over 80%, especially if applied in distribution and transmission grids. “It is an ideal energy storage system without obvious performance drawbacks and will be expected to provide critical technical support for developing renewable energy power systems,” they concluded.
Their findings are presented in the paper “The structure and control strategies of hybrid solid gravity energy storage system,” published in the Journal of Energy Storage. The research team comprises scientists from the North China Electric Power University and the State Grid Smart Grid Research Institute Co., Ltd.

US retailer Target, known for being ahead of the sustainability curve, has solar installed on nearly 550 locations or more than 25% of its stores. The company’s sustainability strategy, called Target Forward, commits the retailer to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions enterprise-wide by 2040.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) Solar Means Business 2022 Target is one of the top four companies for solar installed on site, which—at the time—amounted to 255 MW of capacity.
To stay ahead of the curve, Target decided to update the solar equipment on a Target facility in Los Angeles. While manufacturers often claim that solar modules last 20 to 30 years, they degrade over time. In research conducted at the National Renewable Energy Lab, for example, it was found that solar modules lose about 0.5% of output each year. At that rate, 20-year old solar modules would be producing about 90% of their original output. In addition, new technologies offer higher output, and corporations such as Target may find it cost effective to decommission older technology and replace it with new.
The Los Angeles Target installation consisted of legacy Shell Powerlight modules, Xantrax inverters, and an integrated PowerGuard flat racking solution. The entire project, including all system equipment, was removed in three weeks by Decom Solar LLC, a company that specializes in decommissioning. The 360 kW installation is being replaced by a new, state-of-the art system by PowerFlex, a national provider of onsite sustainable energy solutions.
Decom reports that it guarantees that all solar equipment they work with will be properly redeployed, reinstalled or recycled, and in this case they chose Solarcycle for recycling. Upon completion, a certificate of recycling will be provided as proof of proper handling.
“PowerFlex continues to demonstrate its commitment to sustainability, and this is one of many projects we have worked with a company to safely and responsibly decommission projects,” said Stephen Burns, co-founder of Decom Solar. “This is an important step in reducing our environmental impact and creating a more sustainable future for all.”
All modules from the project have been transported to Solarcycle’s recycling facility in Odessa, Texas, where the modules will be processed, recycled, and reintegrated into the supply chain. Solarcycle was founded in 2022 by industry experts from leading corporations and institutions such as Solaria, NEXTracker, Sierra Club, and the University of New South Wales.
The company said its recycling solution can recover more than 95% of vital materials that can be reused. Its technology allows it to extract metals including silver, silicon, copper, and aluminum and to recycle or repurpose 95% of panels currently in use. In April the U.S. Department of Energy awarded Solarcycle a $1.5 million research grant to study the process for recovering higher-quality metals and materials extracted from retired solar panels. This came on the heels of a $30 million funding raise.
“Commercial stores not only hold huge potential to generate renewable energy, but they can also help our country build a solar circular economy through recycling commitments,” said Jesse Simons, CEO of Solarcycle.
Decom promises to plant one tree for each solar module removed, so after this decommissioning project, the company reports that it donated 4,795 trees to One Tree Planted, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to global reforestation.
