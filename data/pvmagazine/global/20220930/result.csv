The Euronext Paris-listed company has also announced the construction of “Europe's largest hydrogen vessels factory” in Compiègne, France. The facility will make 80,000 vessels per year, with the first units set for production in 2025. In addition, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne announced €74 million ($72.3 million) of funding support to develop Plastic Omnium's hydrogen activities, under the Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) framework. Earlier this month, Plastic Omnium also said that it will start collaborating with Safra in 2023 to support the development of its Hycity range of hydrogen-powered buses and retrofit service, which converts diesel coaches to hydrogen.
Yara Clean Ammonia has followed Equinor and Gassco to join Hystar's field project HyPilot. The world's largest ammonia distributor will contribute to testing green hydrogen in industrial operations. “HyPilot will verify Hystar's patented technology under realistic field conditions and see the first in-field test of Hystar's 1 MW containerized electrolyzer next year,” said PEM electrolysis specialist Hystar. The electrolyzer will run for a total of 10,000 hours. “Compared to conventional PEM electrolyzers, the membrane in Hystar's patented design is significantly thinner, providing better efficiency due to lower resistance across the membrane,” wrote Hystar. The company has already run the electrolyzer for 5,000 hours. Over the coming months, it will build the containerized PEM electrolyzer, with a hydrogen production capacity of up to 500 kg per day.
Fusion Fuel has entered into a €5 million technology sales agreement with Spanish developer Gedisol to supply solar-to-hydrogen systems for a 3.2 MW green hydrogen project in Andalucía, Spain. “The facility will consist of 144 HEVO-Solar trackers that will generate an estimated 200 tons of green hydrogen per annum. The company expects to begin construction early next year and achieve commercial operation in [the third quarter of] 2023,” said the Irish-Portuguese hydrogen company. Fusion Fuel focuses on PEM electrolyzer technology. 
First Hydrogen has announced plans to expand into the European market. The Canadian company's new initiative will focus on identifying and signing up fleets interested in participating in the planned European trials of the first hydrogen light commercial vans expected to commence in early 2024 in Germany and France. The EU markets represent 35% of the global light commercial vehicle market. 
FM Logistic has registered a hydrogen refueling station in Spain with the Junta de Castilla La Mancha. It is the company's second such facility in the country. “It has been a bureaucratic process of which there are hardly any previous references,” said Mario Barragán, legal manager of H2B2.
H2 MOBILITY Germany has opened its first hydrogen station in Landshut, Germany. The new filling station offers hydrogen and all the conventional fuels and services.
Joule has published an article by Jan Rosenow indicating that independent evidence does not support the widespread use of hydrogen for space and hot water heating. Rosenow reviewed 32 studies and concluded that none of them support the case for the widespread use of hydrogen for heating. However, some researchers have identified complementary roles for hydrogen – particularly in district heating and hybrid heating systems. “Policymakers are therefore well advised to consider the existing research carefully before allocating significant public funds for hydrogen heating,” Rosenow wrote. He suggested that decision makers should instead support the deployment of energy-efficient heat pumps, district heating, and solar thermal.

Saint-Gobain, a French building materials suppliers, has announced a strategic partnership with Megasol, a Swiss building integrated-photovoltaics (BIPV) module manufacturer.
Under the terms of the agreement, Saint-Gobain has acquired a minority stake in Megasol's BIPV module development and production business at its site in Deitingen, Switzerland.
The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the deal, said Daniel Sägesser, a member of Megasol's management board, in response to an inquiry from pv magazine. The closing of the transaction has already taken place.
The new investment strengthens Saint-Gobain's status as a supplier of BIPV facade solutions, which is one of the fastest growing segments in facade construction, according to the French group.
“Thanks to the aesthetic design of Megasol's products and its fully customized and industrialized production, we are expanding the scope of our applications, enabling Saint-Gobain's complete facade solutions to grow significantly,” said Patrick Maier, general manager of Saint-Gobain Switzerland.
In turn, Megasol will benefit from Saint-Gobain's customer portfolio to expand its presence in Europe.
“With its sustainable construction strategy and extensive expertise in glass and building envelopes, as well as its global presence, Saint-Gobain is the perfect partner to rapidly develop our active solar building materials business,” said Markus Gisler, the CEO of Megasol.
In March, Megasol unveiled a bifacial solar module with a reported power conversion efficiency of 23.2%. In June, it launched a new in-roof system that purportedly can be used to deploy homogeneous, flush-fitting rooftop PV installations.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/30/policy-proposals-to-accelerate-heat-pump-deployment/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2022",Policy proposals to accelerate heat pump deployment,"In “Heating up the global heat pump market,” recently published in Nature Energy, researchers at the Regulatory Assistance Project – a global NGO with offices in China, Europe and the United States – proposed a number of policy recommendations to build confidence in heat pump technology and meet climate goals.
First, policymakers should ensure that there are clear financial incentives for building owners to invest in heat pumps. The researchers said that building owners should be given subsidies, grants, tax rebates or low interest loans to reduce the capex burden of heat pumps. They noted that such policies have already been implemented in many countries. They cited Sweden, Norway and Finland as examples in how to raise taxes on fossil fuel to reduce the operating costs of heat pumps.
Second, regulatory measures like introducing building, renovation, and appliance performance standards, as well as bans on fossil-fuel appliances, are recommended to scale up heat pump deployment. The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark are among the countries identified as already having variations of these measures in place.
Finally, trust and consumer confidence must be built in less mature markets. The researchers give the example of Sweden, where information campaigns, training, technical standards for installations and equipment, and costumer complaint services played a crucial role in making the technology a mainstream heating system option.
“Recent policy announcements, including bans of fossil fuel heating, mandates for heat pumps and pricing reform, suggest that policy makers have understood and are willing to provide markets with the necessary technology clarity to ensure that heat pump installation rates will increase further in future years,” the authors said. “Recent market expansion instils confidence that more rapid deployment of heat pumps is feasible if supported by well-designed policies.”
Heat pump sales grew by 34% in Europe in 2021. The European markets with the highest growth last year were Poland (+87%), Ireland (+69%), Italy (+63%), Slovakia (+42%) Norway (+36%), France (+36%) and Germany (+28%). The five biggest European heat pump markets were France (537,000 units), Italy (382,000), Germany (177,000), Spain (148,000), and Sweden (135,000).
Northern European countries have the largest share of heat pumps, with 60% of Norwegian households using heat pumps, 43% in Sweden, 41% in Finland, and 34% in Estonia. In Sweden, 29% of heating demand from buildings is covered by heat pumps, and 15% in Finland.
China is the world’s largest market for air source heat pumps, where sales grew around 7% in 2021, reaching 12.5 million units. Japan is the second largest market in the world, but its heat hump market contracted by 5% in 2021. The United States came in third, with market growth of 15% in 2021. Sales of air-source heat pumps in the country were higher than gas furnaces for the first time in 2020. Around 40% to 50% of new buildings in the United States install heat pumps as their heating device, varying by building type.
Initial figures for 2021 show that the heat pump market recovered from 2020, when the global market grew by just 3%, according to IEA data. The pandemic and associated decline in economic activity mostly explain the slow market growth at that time. At rates observed until 2020, only 253 million heat pumps would be installed globally by 2030.
Before 2020, the global market had been growing by around 10% on a yearly basis. But 13% year-on-year global market growth will be needed until 2030 to achieve the International Energy Agency’s net-zero scenario. If it is achieved, 600 million heat pumps will be installed throughout the world by 2030.

The new BIPV product will add UV/thermal stabilizers to Solvay’s existing stabilizer CYASORB CYNERGY B series solutions. A company spokesperson told pv magazine that these are “already commercialized and available globally for stabilizing durable high value polyolefin-based products such as single ply TPO membranes, geomembranes, siding and stadium seating … this specific product developed for BIPV will be commercialized by the end of the year and further scale up is planned for next year in China.”
Solvay’s stabilization technology can reportedly extend a roofing membrane’s UV and thermal durability, thereby pushing the product’s service life to up to 25 years. This will enable 3TREES to comply with the 25-year weathering requirement for BIPV TPO roofing in China, which current products are purportedly unable to meet.
The UV/thermal stabilizers prevent micro-crack formation, loss of gloss and color shift, and do not interfere with sealing, painting and other surface treatments, according to the company. Solvay’s additives are usually incorporated in the TPO membranes, but can also be used in PV panels and support systems, providing UV protection for backsheet films and heat stability combined with chemical resistance.
The new product has been tested by 3TREES for thermal aging and UV weathering, and “shows superior stabilization performance at retention of surface and physical properties after aging, especially under high temperature,” according to a Solvay spokesperson. The collaboration between the two companies will cover product testing, qualification, market promotion, new project development and production.

Now, Chinese researchers are shifting the focus to single cells and two cells connected in series or in parallel. They described their findings in “Experimental study on the power losses of a single photovoltaic cell and two series and parallel connected cells with partial shadows,” which was recently published in the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy.
The team applied shadows generated by accurately sized objects to simulate shading conditions. They found that only the area of the shadow affected the output current of small PV systems.
The scientists initially set up the experiment for a single cell with an output current of 71.4 mA, shading the cell from three to 30 seconds and removing the obstacle at 30 seconds. They said the results showed that “the decrease in output current caused by shadowing is proportional to the area of the shadow.” A shadow with an area of 14.8% of the PV cell area causes a current decrease ratio of 15.1%, and 37.0% and 59.2% shading areas cause decrease ratios of 37.8% and 59.6%, respectively.
The scientists also observed proportional ratios of shadowed areas and lower output current in two PV cells that were connected in parallel.
“The output current decrease ratios of the parallel connected PV module are 6.4%, 17.8%, and 29.1% from small to large, respectively, which is almost the same as the shading ratio under different conditions,” they said. “Accordingly, there is no additional power loss when shading the parallel PV module.”
For two cells connected in series, however, the scientists observed excess power loss and rise in temperature, which can cause further output degradation. When shaded to 7.4%, 18.5%, and 29.6% ratios, cell A showed a current decrease ratio of 8.7%, 31.9%, and 55.6%, respectively, and cell B showed decreased ratios of 15.6%, 37.4%, and 57.6%, respectively.
“The output reduction of PV cells highly depends on the shading conditions of the series connected module,” the researchers concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/30/how-long-do-rooftop-residential-solar-panels-last-2/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2022",How long do rooftop residential solar panels last?,"From pv magazine USA
Residential solar panels are often sold with long-term loans or leases, with homeowners entering contracts of 20 years or more. But how long do panels last, and how resilient are they?
Panel life depends on several factors, including climate, module type, and the racking system. While there isn’t a specific “end date” for a panel per se, loss of production over time often forces equipment retirements.
When deciding whether to keep your panel running 20 to 30 years in the future, or to look for an upgrade at that time, monitoring output levels is the best way to make an informed decision. The loss of output over time, called degradation, typically lands at about 0.5% each year, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
Manufacturers typically consider 25 to 30 years a point at which enough degradation has occurred where it may be time to consider replacing a panel. The industry standard for manufacturing warranties is 25 years on a solar module, said NREL.
Given the 0.5% benchmark annual degradation rate, a 20-year-old panel is capable of producing about 90% of its original capability.
Panel quality can make some impact on degradation rates. NREL reports premium manufacturers like Panasonic and LG have rates of about 0.3% per year, while some brands degrade at rates as high as 0.80%. After 25 years, these premium panels could still produce 93% of their original output, and the higher-degradation example could produce 82.5%.
A sizeable portion of degradation is attributed to a phenomenon called potential induced degradation (PID), an issue experienced by some, but not all, panels. PID occurs when the panel’s voltage potential and leakage current drive ion mobility within the module between the semiconductor material and other elements of the module, like the glass, mount, or frame. This causes the module’s power output capacity to decline, in some cases significantly.
Some manufacturers build their panels with PID-resistant materials in their glass, encapsulation, and diffusion barriers.
All panels also suffer something called light induced degradation (LID), in which panels lose efficiency within the first hours of being exposed to the sun. LID varies from panel to panel based on the quality of the crystalline silicon wafers, but usually results in a one-time, 1-3% loss in efficiency, said testing laboratory PVEL, PV Evolution Labs.
Weathering conditions
Exposure to weather conditions is the main driver in panel degradation. Heat is a key factor in both real-time panel performance and degradation over time. Ambient heat negatively affects the performance and efficiency of electrical components, said NREL.
By checking the manufacturer’s data sheet, a panel’s temperature coefficient can be found, which will demonstrate the panel’s ability to perform in higher temperatures.
The coefficient explains how much real-time efficiency is lost by each degree of Celsius increased above the standard temperature of 25 C. For example, a temperature coefficient of -0.353% means that for every degree Celsius above 25, 0.353% of total production capability is lost.
Heat exchange drives panel degradation through a process called thermal cycling. When it is warm, materials expand, and when the temperature lowers, they contract. This movement slowly causes microcracks to form in the panel over time, lowering output.
In its annual Module Score Card study, PVEL analyzed 36 operational solar projects in India, and found significant impacts from heat degradation. The average annual degradation of the projects landed at 1.47%, but arrays located in colder, mountainous regions degraded at nearly half that rate, at 0.7%.
Proper installation can help deal with heat related issues. Panels should be installed a few inches above the roof, so that convective air can flow beneath and cool the equipment. Light-colored materials can be used in panel construction to limit heat absorption. And components like inverters and combiners, whose performance is particularly sensitive to heat, should be located in shaded areas, suggested CED Greentech. 
Wind is another weather condition that can cause some harm to solar panels. Strong wind can cause flexing of the panels, called dynamic mechanical load. This also causes microcracks in the panels, lowering output. Some racking solutions are optimized for high-wind areas, protecting the panels from strong uplift forces and limiting microcracking. Typically, the manufacturer’s datasheet will provide information on the max winds the panel is able to withstand.
The same goes for snow, which can cover panels during heavier storms, limiting output. Snow can also cause a dynamic mechanical load, degrading the panels. Typically, snow will slide off of panels, as they are slick and run warm, but in some cases a homeowner may decide to clear the snow off the panels. This must be done carefully, as scratching the glass surface of the panel would make a negative impact on output.
Degradation is a normal, unavoidable part of a panel’s life. Proper installation, careful snow clearing, and careful panel cleaning can help with output, but ultimately, a solar panel is a technology with no moving parts, requiring very little maintenance.
To ensure a given panel is likely to live a long life and operate as planned, it must undergo standards testing for certification. Panels are subject to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) testing, which apply to both mono- and polycrystalline panels.
EnergySage said panels that achieve IEC 61215 standard are tested for electrical characteristics like wet leakage currents, and insulation resistance. They under go a mechanical load test for both wind and snow, and climate tests that check for weaknesses to hot spots, UV exposure, humidity-freeze, damp heat, hail impact, and other outdoor exposure.
IEC 61215 also determines a panel’s performance metrics at standard test conditions, including temperature coefficient, open-circuit voltage, and maximum power output.
Also commonly seen on a panel spec sheet is the seal of Underwriters Laboratories (UL), which also provides standards and testing. UL runs climactic and aging tests, as well as the full gamut of safety tests.
Failure factors 
Solar panel failure happens at a low rate. NREL conducted a study of over 50,000 systems installed in the United States and 4,500 globally between the years of 2000 and 2015. The study found a median failure rate of 5 panels out of 10,000 annually.
Panel failure has improved markedly over time, as it was found that system installed between 1980 and 2000 demonstrated a failure rate double the post-2000 group.
System downtime is rarely attributed to panel failure. In fact, a study by kWh Analytics found that 80% of all solar plant downtime is a result of failing inverters, the device that converts the panel’s DC current to usable AC. pv magazine will analyze inverter performance in the next edition of this series.

Adani Solar, the solar PV manufacturing unit of Adani Group, aims to have 10 GW of polysilicon-to-solar module manufacturing capacity up and running by 2025. 
The Indian manufacturer now has 2 GW of monocrystalline cell and module capacity in the Indian state of Gujarat. It is executing the expansion and backward integration in stages at its existing manufacturing sites in the state. 
“We will increase our cell and module capacity to 10 GW by 2025, from 2 GW at present. Of the new 8 GW addition, we expect to commission a 2 GW module line in January and the cell line in June next year. This 2 GW addition will be based on n-type TopCon,” Rahul Bhutiani, head of sales and marketing at Adani Solar, told pv magazine at Renewable Energy India Expo 2022. “For the balance 6 GW, we are weighing the pros and cons of technologies like heterojunction and TopCon.”
Adani Solar is also setting up 2 GW of ingot and wafer capacity, which will likely become operational by December 2023. The company will scale the ingot and wafer capacity to 10 GW by 2025. Additionally, it will have an equivalent polysilicon capacity ready by June 2025.
At the same location, Adani will house ancillary units for key elements like aluminum frames, glass, junction boxes, backsheet, and trackers.
“For ancillary production, we could promote a local entrepreneur by raising a stake and support offtake by using the production for our captive consumption,” said Bhutiani.

First and foremost, this includes the desired price cap on imports of pipeline gas and liquefied petroleum gas. If the offer price on the world markets is higher than the price cap, the member states must provide a pot of funding to pay the difference. The funds for this are to be raised by all member states.
“A gas price cap – that is, a legal maximum price for gas on the energy exchanges – is exactly the wrong approach and the direct route to gas shortages,” Lion Hirth, professor of energy policy at the Hertie School in Berlin and managing director of the consultancy Neon, told pv magazine Germany. “Why? The industry would roll back all its savings efforts and burn more gas again, storage facilities would run dry, and policymakers would have to respond with forced shutdowns of plants. Nobody can want that.”
Capping import prices is unlikely to be an easy task, as the EU Commission has indicated. The increased imports of liquefied gas that have helped the EU this year have come at a price. European demand for liquefied gas next year is between 130 and 140 billion cubic meters. That exceeds global capacity increases in 2022 and poses real problems for the EU.
However, there will be no such thing as just cheaper gas for everyone under the Commission's proposal. The greater the intervention in the gas price, the stronger the measures for reduced consumption and European solidarity-based distribution must be. Consequently, the ministers are also to discuss what further reduction measures are necessary.
To further depress energy prices, the Commission has already adopted a proposal in the case of electricity on Sept. 14, according to which the “extraordinary” profit revenues from some technologies will be skimmed off and will benefit consumers. The proposal also includes a solidarity contribution on profits to be paid by fossil fuel extraction companies. In addition, member states will be free to cap consumer electricity prices for vulnerable households and medium-sized businesses.
“In the electricity market, the EU is essentially about skimming profits from electricity producers and distributing them to affected consumers,” Hirth says. “In principle, this is a sensible crisis measure and can work – if it is implemented properly. The EU's latest proposals have been problematic in many places, so it is feared that electricity prices will end up rising, gas consumption will be driven up, or even system stability will be at risk. Of all the problems, the most fundamental is the meaningful consideration of forward marketing and long-term contracts.”
In this context, the EU Commission is prepared to discuss a system in which the gas price in power generation is additionally capped. This is to prevent the gas price from influencing the electricity price to an excessive extent. By reducing the gas price in other sectors to a lesser extent, if necessary, incentives to save could remain in place.
If the price no longer indicates scarcity, rationing will have to take place. The ministers are also expected to discuss a possible EU-wide organization for the purchase and auction of gas. At this point, the Commission points out that when the price of gas in Europe reaches the new cap, the level of which has yet to be negotiated, demand effectively exceeds supply.
At such times, gas within Europe would have to be rationed by the authorities. This would require the creation of a new authority, to which there is no comparable organization in Europe, as the Commission further admits. At this point, there is also clear talk of “curtailment”, i.e., limiting energy.
With these measures, the Commission wants to reduce Russia's influence on the European gas market. Another goal that the Commission has set itself is to lower consumer prices for gas. In addition, the Commission wants to bring more security to the energy markets and avoid excessive price volatility, which is not guided by demand-supply principles.
In concrete measures, the EU Commission speaks of a plan to fill European gas storage facilities. In addition, there is to be a guarantee that all member states could have access to the gas volumes in an emergency in order to supply vulnerable consumers and critical industries. This also includes that the member states are allowed to regulate and limit consumer prices for gas, for vulnerable households, and medium-sized companies on their own.
The Commission is also targeting gas suppliers with their own production of raw materials. The distortions in the market make it possible to sell to such companies at unprecedented returns, which would be far above the marginal costs of gas production. This threatens the EU economy. This is where the Commission suspects market manipulation.
The Agency for Cooperation and Energy Regulation (ACER) could be given further powers in this move. However, the Commission's current communiqué does not yet name these powers. One of the Commission's proposals to prevent enormous price distortions on the European market is the use of disconnectors to separate the grid if energy prices change significantly.
The loss of Russian imports and the reduced generation capacity of the French nuclear power plant fleet are keeping gas prices above the €200 per megawatt hour level. European industry has been hit hard by the prices. Compared with the previous year, industrial demand for gas fell by 30%.
Some of this was due to process optimization and efficiency measures. But a significant part was also because production was downsized or stopped altogether in some sectors. Against this backdrop, the Commission cautions that there must be a “rapid and coordinated EU-wide response” to high gas prices to “avert lasting social and economic damage.”
Between January and August this year, 39 billion cubic meters less gas flowed into Europe. A drop of 37%, according to the EU Commission. From Russia alone, 43 billion cubic meters are missing. In previous years, Russia supplied around 40% of European gas consumption. This year, it is only nine percent.
However, the EU was able to partially cushion the effect with a 56% increase in liquefied gas imports, or 28 billion cubic meters. Imports from other pipelines, such as North Africa, also increased by 17 billion cubic meters. The EU was able to compensate for the loss of Russian gas imports. The EU gas storage facilities are 86% full. That is 15% more than in the previous year, according to the Commission letter. However, for the next filling phase starting in April 2023, less gas will be able to be imported than this year.

Brookfield Renewable has agreed to acquire Standard Solar and Scout Clean Energy, helping both renewable energy leaders to move into the next phase of their development.
Brookfield Renewable announced the closing of its acquisition of Standard Solar for consideration of $540 million with the potential to invest an additional $160 million to support the business’ growth initiatives. Standard Solar is a developer, owner and operator of commercial and community distributed solar, with approximately 500 MW of operating and under construction contracted assets. The company also has a development pipeline of almost 2 GW and a presence in high value solar markets in the United States, such as New York, Maryland, Minnesota and Maine. Standard Solar is also strong in the community solar market, recently completing a 7.1 MW project in New York.
“Through this acquisition, which provides additional large-scale access to capital, Standard Solar is poised for massive growth, enabling us to contribute in an even more significant way to the clean energy transition,” said Scott Wiater, president and CEO of Standard Solar. “We’re looking forward to joining the Brookfield Renewable portfolio, one of the world’s largest renewable energy platforms. Our two companies share a mutual passion for renewables and company cultures that recognize and amplify excellence and equity – we are the ideal match.”
The company has also agreed to acquire Scout Clean Energy for $1 billion with the potential to invest an additional $350 million to support the business’ development activities. Scout’s portfolio includes over 1.2 GW of operating wind assets, including 4 GW managed on behalf of third parties, and a pipeline of over 22 GW of wind, solar and storage projects across 24 states, including almost 2.5 GW of under construction and advanced-stage projects. Last year, Scout Clean Energy acquired the $400m Blue Sky Project, which followed closely on the heels of the company’s announced purchase of a 112 MW solar project in Missouri.
“Scout is pleased to be sponsored going forward by an industry-leading partner to help Scout continue to grow our rapidly expanding pipeline of wind, solar and battery storage projects across the United States,” said Michael Rucker, CEO and founder of Scout Clean Energy. “With the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we believe now is the right time for Scout to move into our next phase of expansion with a highly respected and experienced partner, like Brookfield Renewable.”
Both Scout and Standard Solar will continue to operate as independent businesses within the Brookfield Renewable U.S. platform. The transactions will be invested through the Brookfield Global Transition Fund I, which has raised $15 billion to invest across a range of transition opportunities.
“We underwrote both transactions without the benefit of the Inflation Reduction Act so the additional incentives now available represent a significant boost to each business,” said Connor Teskey, CEO of Brookfield Renewable. “Our development pipeline in the United States is now close to 60,000 MW and is well diversified across wind, utility-scale solar, distributed generation, and energy storage. Combined with our existing fleet we are well positioned for continued growth as owners and operators of one of the largest diversified clean power businesses in the country.”
The Scout and Standard Solar acquisitions follow a string of recent clean energy investments by Brookfield Renewable in North America during 2022, including a $650 million acquisition of Urban Grid, and the exclusive right to invest up to $750 million on a project by project basis with Entropy, and a joint venture with California Resource Corporation, two leading carbon capture and sequestration platforms in Alberta and California, respectively. Altogether, the Brookfield Global Transition Fund has invested or allocated $3.5 billion for clean energy investments and follow-on capital in North America in 2022.

Karnataka-based Emmvee has unveiled its Sapphire series glass-to-glass bifacial modules at Renewable Energy India Expo 2022. The modules are available in power outputs ranging from 530 W to 545 W, with conversion efficiencies between 20.52% and 21.10% under standard temperature conditions. At low irradiance (200 W/m2, 25 degree Celsius and AM1.5), the module purportedly has at least 95% of its STC efficiency. Open-circuit voltage is 49.2 V to 49.75 V, and short-circuit current is 13.56 A to 13.88 A.
Each module is built with 144 mono PERC half cells and 10 busbars. They measure 2,278 mm x 1,134 mm x 35 mm and weigh 30 kg. The modules come with a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year linear performance warranty. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 2.0%, and the 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 84.95% of the nominal output power.
Emmvee now has 1.25 GW of module capacity in Karnataka.
“We are adding another 2 GW of modules capacity with 1.5 GW of mono PERC and TopCon cell capacity at our existing manufacturing site. This capacity will become operational by December 2023,” Suhas Donthi, director of sales at Emmvee India, told pv magazine.
