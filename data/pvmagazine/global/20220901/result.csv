Enphase Energy, Inc., a microinverter and battery specialist, announced an agreement with Home Connect, an open digital platform that allows home appliances of various brands to be managed with a single app. Enphase will integrate its home energy systems with the Home Connect platform, offering users a way to power Home Connect enabled home appliances.
Home Connect is available for nine well-known home appliance brands including Bosch, Siemens, Gaggenau, Neff, and Thermador. Home Connect is an open platform that enables interaction with other smart home devices and services. Currently Home Connect enabled appliances can be used in 59 countries, in 30 languages and with almost 60 partners.
The new functionality will be available on the Enphase App in the United States and Germany starting with the integration of Home Connect enabled dishwashers, enabling users to optimize their dishwashers around time-of-day energy savings. New features and more appliances will be rolled out with the platform to more countries in the coming year.
Enphase and Home Connect will allow users to set enabled home appliances to run during times of peak solar energy production, off-peak energy times, or when energy prices are lowest. Additionally, consumers can set up the system to run appliances on solar energy saved in home batteries during pre-set time frames. Enphase customers can link a Home Connect account, and then use the Enphase App to manage their Home Connect enabled appliances.
“Thanks to the cooperation with Enphase, the Home Connect enabled dishwasher, washer, dryer, and washer dryer combination will have the ability to be started automatically at the most economic time and maximize the use of clean energy,” said Stefanie Lipps, managing director at Home Connect. “This makes the households of our users more sustainable.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/01/laser-enhanced-contact-optimization-improves-topcon-solar-cell-performance-by-0-6/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2022",Laser-enhanced contact optimization improves TOPCon solar cell performance by 0.6%,"Researchers from Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) and German laser-enhanced contact optimization (LECO) have worked with Cell Engineering GmbH to increase the power conversion efficiency of a tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) solar cell by 0.6%, mainly by using LECO as a post-firing treatment.
The new process, patented by Cell Engineering GmbH in 2016, replaces the conveyor belt furnace (FFO) technology that is commonly used for TOPCon cells and needs peak temperatures higher than 700 C. FFO is known to improve the cell fill factor, but it also leads to increased metal-induced recombination, thus lowering the open-circuit voltage and cell overall efficiency.
“In this work, the use of laser-enhanced contact optimization (LECO) as a post-firing treatment is applied to reduce the contact firing temperature, which enables higher open-circuit voltage and simultaneously higher fill factor values on industrial TOPCon solar cells,” the scientists said.
The LECO process consists of using a highly intense laser pulse on the front side of the solar cell at a constant reverse voltage of more than 10 V, with the resulting current flow of several amperes considerably reducing the contact resistivity between semiconductor and metal electrode.
The German group tested the new approach on TOPCon solar cells with a poly-Si thickness of 80 and 170 nm, respectively.
“The cell's architecture utilizes a boron diffused p+ emitter passivated with a layer stack of a thermally grown silicon dioxide (SiO2), plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) aluminum oxide (AlOx), and silicon nitride (SiNx) layers, an n-type bulk and on the rear the eponymous TOPCon layer,” the researchers explained. “During the anneal, phosphorus diffuses through the thin oxide, creating a tail within the crystalline silicon enabling excellent passivation qualities. Simultaneously, the deposited a-Si crystallizes into a poly-Si. The TOPCon layer is then capped with a PECVD SiNx layer serving as anti-reflection-coating and hydrogen source, crucial for fully activating the passivation.”
The academics determined that the efficiency of the champion solar cell built with the new LECO technique achieved an efficiency of 24.1%, which compares to 23.8% for a reference cell developed without LECO.
“These results match those from Heraeus where they estimated a potential gain for this type of cell of 0.52%,” the scientists said, noting that the best performing call also achieved a fill factor of 81.6%, an open-circuit voltage of 706 mV, and a short-circuit current of 41.3 mA/cm2.
The scientists presented their findings in “Laser-enhanced contact optimization on iTOPCon solar cells,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
“The LECO process can do more than simply improving the average performance of a solar cell; it allows for an overall fine tuning of the whole process sequence and a more homogeneous contact resistivity leading to a narrower fill factor distribution,” they concluded. “On both sides, it allows for thinner and lower doped layers, and potentially the use of additional or thicker dielectric layers that are more resilient to penetration by metal pastes, a reduction of the metal area fraction and extended firing or annealing conditions.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/01/putting-polyvinylidene-fluoride-backsheets-to-the-test/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,QUALITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2022",Putting polyvinylidene-fluoride backsheets to the test,"Polymer-based backsheets have proven to be among the most problematic components for PV modules in the field, with examples of various types of backsheet failure leading to serious performance and safety issues in the field all too common.
Accelerated testing is an important tool in spotting the potential for failure before any specific module is used in the field. However, many backsheet materials have not shown issues in testing according to industry standards set by the International Electrotechnical Commission and other entities, but have still gone on to fail in the field.
Several years ago, US-headquartered materials giant DuPont introduced a new testing sequence, module accelerated sequential testing (MAST), where PV modules are exposed to repeated rounds of high temperature, humidity and ultraviolet light exposure, designed to better simulate conditions in the field. And the company further worked with scientists to develop this into different tests exposing modules to multiple stresses at once, which it calls combined accelerated sequential testing (C-AST). This is designed to simulate specific climate conditions such as dry deserts or humid tropical regions.
In new research, scientists at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory worked with DuPont to test modules with backsheets using a layer of PVDF. They aimed to better understand the degradation mechanisms that affect the material in the field and to develop accelerated tests that mimic them accurately.
The scientists estimate that PVDF-containing backsheets represent around 50% market share currently, with the material present in various forms depending on manufacturer. A field study conducted by DuPont showed that 23% of PVDF backsheets had suffered failure after nine years in the field. DuPont manufactures Tedlar, an alternative material to PVDF also widely used in PV module backsheets.
The group subjected modules to a range of simulated harsh climate conditions, including both sequential and combined thermal cycling, damp heat, ultraviolet light, mechanical stress, rain spray and system voltage. The testing protocol is described in “A study of degradation mechanisms in PVDF-based photovoltaic backsheets,” published in Scientific Reports.
These samples were compared with two modules taken from the field at locations in Arizona and western India, both of which had been deployed for around seven years. The group noted increased crystallinity in the PVDF, which likely plays a role in the cracking that represents the most common failure mode; but says that further investigation is needed to confirm the mechanism that causes PVDF to crack.
Both types of accelerated testing produced some backsheet degradation along similar lines to those taken from the field, though neither was a close enough match to be certain of the mechanisms or cause.
“Neither of the single or sequential tests closely replicated the degradation mechanisms seen in the fielded backsheets; however, the MAST test was useful in identifying weaknesses in the material that led to failure,” the paper concludes. “Despite the fact that C-AST and MAST tests did not completely replicate the complex nature of the outdoor environment, both tests are valid for screening outdoor failure mechanisms in PVDF backsheets.”

The Commission de régulation de l'énergie (CRE) , France's energy regulator, has published an updated version of all specifications of the “CRE4” and “PPE2” renewable energy tenders.
The new specifications include regulatory changes announced earlier this summer by the government. They will facilitate faster deployment of renewable energy facilities across the country. In total, the changes concern 17 specifications for different renewable energy sources, 13 of which relate to solar tenders, in mainland France or in non-interconnected areas. The changes apply to ground-mount and rooftop projects, as well as self-consumption arrays and installations without storage.
The project portfolio contains around 6.1 GW of renewable energy capacity at different stages of development and operation, including 3.4 GW of wind power and 2.7 GW of solar. The winners of the tenders will be able to take advantage of these arrangements, provided that they make a request to the French Ministry of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Spatial Planning from Sept. 1.
“The general objective of these modifications is to enable producers to absorb part of the increase in costs and prices, in particular by selling their power production on the market,” the CRE said in a press release.
The authorities have published a list of the solar tenders, arranged according to the type of installation:

H2X Global said its new 5 kW fuel cell generator, which uses hydrogen to generate electricity with zero emissions, has been sold to the Plumbing Industry Climate Action Centre (PICAC) for use at its Hydrogen Centre of Excellence in Queensland, Australia.
The Power H2 unit, which is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell and comes equipped with a small hydrogen storage tank, will be installed at the PICAC facility. The center, which is due to open in October, will serve as Australia’s first dedicated hydrogen training facility.
H2X Global CEO Brendan Norman said the sale of the demonstration model marked a turning point for the use of renewable energy in emergency and off-grid power supply.
“We have developed a range of fuel cell generators delivering differing power outputs to be the alternative to fossil-fuel generators in the energy transition to zero emissions,” he said. “The generator is a turnkey hydrogen power solution with a zero-emissions operation.”
Norman said the hydrogen fuel cell gensets, which will be available in sizes ranging from 2 kW to 100 kW capacity, are ideal as a backup power systems for hospitals and businesses.
“The H2X generators are ideally suited to replace standard petrol or diesel generators, allowing you to switch to an emission-free hydrogen fuel cell operation,” he said.
The sale of the demonstration model was overseen by Sydney-based company Pure Hydrogen, which owns a 23% stake in H2X Global.
“This power generation unit has at its heart, a hydrogen fuel cell and a powertrain that have been developed over several years,” said Pure Hydrogen Managing Director Scott Brown. “This technology is at the forefront of the hydrogen revolution, and it is great to see it being implemented commercially.”

Arctech, a Chinese supplier of tracking, racking, and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), said it has launched its latest solar tracking solution, SkyWings. The dual-row tracker is designed with bidirectional slew drives and a multi-point drive mechanism.
It said SkyWings combines the advantages of dual-row solar trackers and is compatible with undulating terrain, with high rigidity enabled by a multi-point drive design. The patented bidirectional slew drives allow two rows to move in synchronicity.
The undulation tolerance of adjacent rows has increased to 15% in both east/west and north/south directions. The modular design allows flexibility in plant layout design, in order to accommodate more PV modules than conventional trackers in the same conditions, said Arctech.
SkyWings incorporates a multi-point drive mechanism and specially designed torque tube-the patented triple D torque tube, allowing for stowing in a horizontal position with the highest stability.
The rack allows modules to be stowed flat, which prevents cracking and delamination, particularly in newer large-format modules. SkyWings only starts stowing at 22 meters per second, which generates up to 2% more energy yield per year, leading to a lower levelized cost of energy.
The post span can be extended by 10 meters, which the company said can bring down installation costs by up to 20% and the entire engineering, procurement, and construction expenditure by up to 2%, compared to projects utilizing traditional 1P trackers.
The trackers are controlled by second-generation AI-assisted algorithms, calculating optimum tilt in various weather conditions and topographies. Arctech said the real-time shading avoidance can boost production by 8%.
In desert environments, the SkyWing tracker can be paired with Artech’s cleaning robot, SkyWe.

The plan was first announced in January 2021. The South Korean government said that access to the PPA market will now be given to projects exceeding 300 kW in size, in order to encourage renewable energy deals for buildings. Under the old rules, the size threshold had been set at 1 MW.
Under the so-called K-RE100 scheme, state-owned Korea Electric Power Corp (Kepco) will act as an intermediary between sellers and buyers. Prior to the introduction of the program, consumers could exclusively buy electricity from the national utility.
SK E&S, a South Korean natural liquefied gas (LNG) supplier, secured the country's first PPA from Seoul-based Amorepacific in March. The electricity will be provided by a 5 MW renewable energy plant operated by SK E&S at an unspecified location. Power supplies are set to start from the fourth quarter of this year. As of December 2021, SK E&S was operating and developing 1.3 GW of solar capacity. 
In early August, SK Specialty agreed to buy electricity from 50 MW of renewables assets in South Korea’s South Chungcheong province throughout the 2024-44 period at an undisclosed price. The industrial group described the deal as South Korea's largest renewables PPA ever. It said that other subsidiaries such as SK Trichem and SK Materials Performance may soon follow with similar deals.
Under the K-RE100 initiative, the South Korean government wants the country to be fully powered by renewable energy by 2050.

“PPA activity remained at relatively low levels, although July saw an uptake in both deal count (+50%) and contracted capacity (+57%), with interesting deals coming from Spain, Germany, Italy and Greece,” said Pexapark. “The strong upward trend is on the back of rallying underlying forward prices, which made our index reach levels above €100/MWh for the first time.”
In July, around 596 MW of capacity was built in Europe, involving 15 deals.
“Spain saw some of the most interesting deals of the month, including the largest PPA by volume between Acciona Energía and 20 industrial offtakers for 1 TWh for several projects with undisclosed capacity,” said Pexapark. “In Greece Cero and Axpo signed a 70 MW solar PPA, which is the second ever PPA announced in the country. What’s more, two new deals were announced in Italy, marking a slight uptake in deal flow in recent months.”
For the first six months of the year, Pexapark said there was a decrease of around 15% in PPAs. Roughly 44% less new capacity was built than in the first half of 2021, which was the strongest period to date. In June, European PPA prices fell by 11%.

The project is owned by Intraco Solar Power Ltd. (ISPL), a unit of publicly listed Paramount Textile Ltd. (PTL), which is mainly involved in textile production. Recently, it started to diversify its investment portfolio.
The BPDB will buy electricity from the power plant at a rate of $0.16/kWh over a period of 20 years. The company invested $55 million in 110 acres of land to set up of the power plant. It used around 78,764 solar panels.
“We expect $9 million per annum as revenue from the power plant,” a senior PTL official said, adding that the company has plans to further expand its investments in the renewable energy sector.
In April, Paramount Textile said that it would invest in another 100 MW solar power plant by acquiring a 49% stake in Dynamic Sun Energy Private, in northwestern Bangladesh. The estimated cost of the grid-tied solar power plant is around $150 million. The BPDB will buy electricity from the plant at a rate of $0.1195/kWh.
Bangladesh currently generates about 910 MW of its electricity from renewable sources. The government wants the nation to produce 40% of its energy from renewable sources by 2040.
