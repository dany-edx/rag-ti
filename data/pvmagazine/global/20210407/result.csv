Maxeon Solar Technologies said it will ramp up efforts to sell its Performance line shingled module technology in the U.S., facilitated by the deployment of up to 3.6 GW of new assembly capacity in two phases.
The expansion depends on the company obtaining debt or equity financing to buy equipment, after which initial sales are expected to start in the first quarter of 2022.
Maxeon already has a presence in the U.S. rooftop market through its supply of interdigitated back contact (IBC) panels to SunPower Corp. Maxeon said it will also supply the Performance panels to SunPower. Maxeon was launched in 2020 as an independent company following its spin-off from SunPower.
Maxeon said that in phase one of its capacity expansion it will use existing facilities to ramp 1.8 GW of new capacity. Large-format G12 mono-PERC solar cells are planned to be manufactured at the company’s site in Malaysia, and module assembly is planned to be done at a facility in Mexicali, Mexico.
The company next will select a site for a U.S.-based module assembly facility with a capacity of up to an additional 1.8 GW. Depending on site conditions and market demand, the second phase is expected to begin operation in 2023.
The company said that greater volume in Malaysia and Mexico will improve its overhead utilization, helping to drive down costs for its IBC products. It said its Mexicali factory is well-placed to reach customers in the Southwest U.S.
The new capacity will be used to manufacture Maxeon’s shingled bifacial panel technology, with a rated power of up to 650 W per panel and efficiency that the company said is greater than 21%. It said its primary target market for the new capacity will be utility-scale power plants and large commercial and industrial systems.

According to Orix, this is its largest deal secured for an unsubsidized solar project in Japan to date. This market segment, on the other hand, has always been neglected by solar energy developers, as generous feed-in tariffs have been granted to large scale PV over the past two decades.
The solar facility will supply power to Kaihara’s Sanwa factory, located in Jinseki, in the Hiroshima prefecture, and will cover around 12% of its electricity demand. “In addition, through … procurement capability utilizing Orix’s economies of scale, the introduction of this large scale solar power generation system is expected to allow the electricity charge per unit procured through this PPA model to be reduced by approximately 25% at [the] Sanwa factory compared to the past rate,” Orix said in a statement.
The company had launched its PPA business model in August 2020 and previously implemented its PPA business model at several supermarkets in Gifu and Shizuoka prefectures. “In this model, Orix is responsible for installing and operating solar power generation systems, lithium-ion storage batteries, and energy management systems, and supplying the generated electricity to consumers,” it explained at the time.

The Malian government has awarded a 30-year concession to Legendre Energie, a unit of French construction company Legendre, to finance, design, build and operate a 50 MWp solar power plant.
The project, for which a preliminary agreement was signed with the Malian government in 2016, will require an investment of CFA60.8 billion (€92.7 million). 
A power purchase agreement will be signed between the national company Énergie du Mali (EDM-SA) and the special purpose vehicle Fana Solar Power, the Malian government said in a statement released after the cabinet meeting.
In addition, Bamako approved the construction of a photovoltaic solar power plant in the Ségou Cercle administrative subdivision of the Ségou region. Dormant since 2015, when it secured authorization from the Malian authorities, this project benefits from the fall in the price of solar equipment on international markets and from the additional financing of related infrastructure by the Norwegian government, allowing a review of the project costs.
The solar power plant to be built by Norwegian independent power producer Scatec, in the municipality of Pélengana, in the Ségou district, will have a capacity of 33 MW.
The Ségou Solaire special purpose vehicle will develop this project in partnership with IFC InfraVentures, a subsidiary of the World Bank group, and local developer Africa Power, for a planned investment of €48.4 million.
Bamako has been trying to speed up its solar program for months, benefiting from lower panel costs. France-based Akuo Energy commissioned its 50 MW solar power plant in Kita last November, the output of which is sold to EDM-SA.
The government of Mali aims to ramp up the country's share of renewable energy in the national electricity mix to 25% by 2033, in addition to a 61% rural electrification target.
According to the latest statistics published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Mali only had 70 MW of cumulative installed solar capacity by the end of 2020. All of last year's newly installed capacity was represented by Akuo's solar plant in Kita.

The 50% state-owned Saudi developer made the announcement as it issued a press release to mark the signing of a 25-year power offtake agreement, network connection and right-of-use of the land with the Egyptian authorities. The Kom Ombo plant was originally set to be constructed by this month.
Rajit Nanda, ACWA's chief portfolio management officer and acting chief investment officer, said the facility would generate clean power at a price that “is the lowest in the African continent for a project that is soon to achieve financial close and commence construction.” pv magazine reported, in October 2019, ACWA had secured the tender with a final electricity price bid of $0.02752/kWh.
The company statement said ACWA is aiming to reach financial close and start construction before October, after securing a $40 million loan on top of the $14 million equity bridge loan pledged by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development and a $27 million credit line from fellow development lender the African Development Bank.
The power purchase and grid connection agreements–plus the usufruct deal, which guarantees use of the land for the project–were signed by state entities the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company and the New and Renewable Energy Authority.
Egyptian minister of electricity and renewable energy, Mohamed Shaker El Markabi, used the occasion to hint at a raising of his country's clean power ambition. Quoted in the ACWA press release, he said: “In line with Egypt’s Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy, our aim is to produce 42% of Egypt’s electricity using renewable sources by 2035. Currently, necessary studies are being conducted to increase this percentage, stressing on maximizing the utilization of renewable energy in many areas, including water desalination and green hydrogen production.”
Egypt aims to generate 22% of its electricity from renewables by next year but was lagging well short at the end of last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, which has estimated only 10.1% of generation came from clean power sources at that point.
ACWA said its energy operations in Egypt include 120 MW of solar generation capacity at the huge Benban solar field and a 2.25 GW gas plant in the Luxor governorate.

Spanish energy company Iberdrola has announced it will team up with Spain-based insurance group Mapfre to jointly invest in renewable energy in Spain.
The two companies set up a joint venture to build wind and solar power plants across Spain. The largest shareholder will be Mapfre, with a 80% stake, and Iberdrola is holding the remaining 20%.
The joint company's current renewable energy portfolio consists of 100 MW of operational wind power plants and 130 MW of PV plants which are under development. The agreement provides for the incorporation of other operating assets, as well as new renewable energy development projects, for a total capacity of up to 1,000 MW.
The 100 MW in operating assets are located in Castilla y León, distributed in two wind farms, in Soria and Burgos. The 130 MW of photovoltaic capacity is in the development phase in Castilla-La Mancha, in the province of Guadalajara, and its commissioning is scheduled during the third quarter of 2022.
Until now, Mapfre has made its investments in renewable energy assets through real estate and infrastructure funds or private equity. At the end of last year, the group made the first closing of its first infrastructure fund, amounting to €300 million, which it launched together with Spanish firm Abante to invest in funds from Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA), the largest infrastructure group in the world.
Iberdrola and Mapfre began their collaboration in the energy field in January, when they reached an agreement to provide, with renewable electricity, nearly 3,000 offices of the insurance group in Spain.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/07/new-materials-for-organic-redox-flow-batteries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,RUSSIA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"APRIL 7, 2021",New materials for organic redox flow batteries,"Thanks to the potential size of the market for electric vehicles, battery research in recent years has tended to focus on innovations in lithium-ion and other related chemistries that promise to serve this market.
For the large-scale energy storage that is increasingly required to balance the intermittency of wind and solar energy, however, redox-flow batteries present an attractive opportunity. The batteries are inherently scalable, and avoid many of the issues with long-term performance, safety, and material availability associated with lithium-ion batteries. Many of the early commercial projects for redox flow batteries (RFBs) rely on vanadium, which comes with some toxicity concerns. There is, however, a long list of materials worth investigating as flow battery components, including abundant organic materials.
Among other issues, organic redox flow batteries are held back by low specific capacity. Finding new materials (and combinations of materials) with better characteristics is the simplest way to overcome this challenge, and has been the focus for a group of scientists led by Russian’s Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech). “We are working with organic redox-active materials solubilized in organic solvents (non-aqueous organic RFBs),” says Skoltech Ph.D. student Elena Romadina. “The main advantages for non-aqueous organic RFB are high cell voltage (up to 5V, versus around 1.6 V for water-based systems), a huge variety of organic redox-active molecules which could be applied, and potential operability at low temperatures, without any concern for freezing below 0 degrees C,” she stated
Romadina is the lead author of two new papers exploring new organic materials for RFBs, published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry A and in Chemical Communications. The first evaluated a series of seven promising catholyte materials, and the second describes the synthesis of a phenazine-based anolyte material.
Combining the two resulted in a flow battery that achieved a high cell voltage of 2.3 V and better than 95% coulombic efficiency, as well as high capacity and good stability over 50 cycles. This battery is described further in the Chemical Communications paper.
The group notes that the poly-triarylamine materials it demonstrated as catholytes have previously shown promise as cathodes in metal-ion batteries, but had not previously been investigated in flow battery chemistries. “A new and very promising core structure was opened up for us and other scientists. Triarylamines have a stable and fully reversible redox potential, and could be easily modified, providing different redox potentials and physical properties,” explains Romadina. “Moreover, we found that triarylamines-based compounds could retain their electrochemical properties even in the presence of water in organic solvent, which lowered the requirements for solvent preparation and cost.”
And while these are promising developments, Skoltech notes that more work is still needed in other areas for organic RFBs to achieve commercial interest. “To make organic RFBs commercially viable, we also need research in areas such as low-cost scalable synthesis of highly soluble redox-active molecules; the development of high-performance membranes that are good ionic conductors, but inhibit cross-over of anolytes and catholytes upon charge and discharge; and the scaling of larger cell and stack level device configurations to enable grid scale energy storage,” noted Skoltech Professor Keith Stevenson.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/07/innovations-in-battery-storage-key-to-a-solar-powered-future/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"APRIL 7, 2021",Innovations in battery storage key to a solar-powered future,"Europe’s residential battery energy storage systems (BESS) market has seen notable growth, with 725 MWh of additional capacity installed over 2019, demonstrating a 57% increase year-on-year. Yet, there’s still immense untapped potential: Only 7% of European residential PV infrastructure is actually coupled with battery storage. While the pandemic has slowed down the pace of new installations, 2021 is bound to see a positive recovery. Looking at cumulative capacities, up to 7.2 GWh of residential batteries could be installed by 2024. 
While Switzerland, Italy, and Austria are making strides, it’s Germany again that is leading the way. Currently, the country holds a 66% market share for residential BESS across the continent – in 2019, Germany installed 63,000 residential battery storage systems. Through partnerships between rooftop solar panels and storage suppliers, consumers can access solar and storage solutions without any hassle. Early adopters aren’t driven only by economics: Their desire to de-risk their future bill, help Europe’s energy transition, or simply become more energy self-sufficient is just as relevant.
In other, more rigid markets, policy progress and commitment are needed to allow for greater integration of solar and storage. For example, unlike in the neighboring Czech Republic, in Slovakia, consumers aren’t allowed to sell excess solar-generated energy back to the grid. Changing this could be a major incentive for individual consumers to embrace novel solutions. 
According to the European Union, innovative storage solutions will be critical to ensuring effective integration of renewables into the grid. And with the institution’s prioritization of smart grid solutions along the way, it’s interesting to observe how well these technologies complement each other. Simply put, solar and storage is bound to play a fundamental role in smart grid networks.
Smart grids enable a constant two-way stream of both data and electricity between the utilities and their customers. With detailed insights and optimization possibilities, solar and storage can be driven to its full potential. Both at the household or company level, such an integrated system can take advantage of every watt that solar panels produce, storing as much energy as possible while sharing any surplus across the smart grid for optimal usage.
The smart system can also tap into a unit’s energy behavior data points and weather forecast to make predictions. Based on those predictions, it can program the running time of devices across households and identify the ideal storage usage so that the battery can be fully charged throughout the day again. Added to that, it can work to manage the capacity of the battery to ensure longevity. 
It’s obvious that solar and storage will function best when integrated within an interconnected energy ecosystem, where every consumer, source, and storage unit become active participants. This should happen under the umbrella of autonomous software solutions that manage the capacity of the battery and monitor the performance of solar panels over time. This information can be confronted with the status of the transmission system, electricity stock prices, and communication with energy suppliers to identify whether there is demand or surplus in the power grid and set the most efficient plan for action. 
The benefits these setups bring could help defeat the notorious perception about the low financial attractiveness of solar and storage, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector that still lacks a defined value proposition.
Such innovations can also be fully autonomic meaning that software itself can decide what part of locally produced solar energy is stored and what part of it is used for direct consumption. Taking into account that the battery is often charged with surplus energy from the grid that could otherwise be wasted or provides energy instead of the fossil ancillary service provider at the time when there is a lack of energy in the grid, the decrease in CO2 emissions is significant. 
The setup also works to stabilize the transmission system, making the whole power grid more reliable. In addition to enjoying lower energy costs, the user is also protected from power outages thanks to the battery backup functionality.
The energy market is ripe for disruption – even oil companies are moving to the renewable and green technology field. No matter what technology, early adopters usually get the highest profits. This will also be the case of innovative solar and storage solutions that work to provide optimal capacity and stabilization services.

Core Lithium’s Finniss Lithium Project, built last year in the Northern Territory, has completed its first product test work, which confirmed the company is producing “battery grade” lithium hydroxide monohydrate, the company said.
The ASX-listed company on Tuesday announced the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) completed test work from a sample of its product, successfully extracting over 95% of lithium from two two-kilogram samples of blended concentrate in separate tests.
Australia is by far the world’s top producer of lithium, with a number of mines concentrated in Western Australia. The Finniss Lithium Project is the first-ever lithium mine to be approved outside of that state and is the first new mine of significant scale to be approved in the NT since 2013.
Global lithium consumption is projected to rise to around 750,000 tons by 2025, spurred by electric vehicle uptake and the expansion of big batteries–which continue to be dominated by lithium-ion models.
Core Lithium said it aspires to have its Finniss Lithium Project at the “forefront” of lithium production for the global market. Proponents of the project argue it has perhaps the best-supporting logistics chain, to markets in Asia, of any Australian lithium project. The project lies within 25km of the port, power station and gas and rail facilities, and one hour by sealed road from workforce accommodation in Darwin and, importantly, from Darwin Port–Australia’s nearest port to Asia. The Finniss Lithium Project was recently awarded major project status by Australia’s federal government.
“Today’s announcement confirms that battery-grade lithium hydroxide suitable for high-end uses in the lithium battery, renewable energy and EV industries, can be produced from Core’s excellent-quality lithium concentrate, produced from the Finniss project,” Core Lithium managing director Stephen Biggins said. The company is also looking at the potential of adding downstream processing infrastructure to its portfolio, he added.
The company said it remains focused on completing its definitive feasibility study for the Finniss Lithium Project and finalizing off-take negotiation deals ahead of its final investment decision, expected in the third quarter of this year.

Helped along by 78 GW of new grid-connected solar facilities across Asia, IRENA said, solar caught up with wind, and the two non-hydropower sources of clean electricity now account for more global capacity than hydro plants.
IRENA confirmed China again led the solar charge, with 49 GW of new grid-connected plants, with regional neighbors Vietnam (11 GW), Japan (more than 5 GW) and India and South Korea (more than 4 GW each) also adding to the Asian total.
With the world adding 127 GW of solar capacity in 2020–the vast majority of it photovoltaics–IRENA said more than 80% of the new electricity plants installed worldwide generate energy from renewables, with solar and wind projects accounting for 91% of that contribution.
The U.S. added 80% more renewables capacity last year than it did in 2019, including 15 GW of solar, according to IRENA's Renewable Energy Capacity Statistics 2021 report. Africa added 2.6 GW of clean power projects and Australia did the heavy lifting as Oceania posted an 18.4% rise in the volume of clean energy capacity added.
With the world reaching 2.8 TW of clean power generation capacity, according to the study, photovoltaics hit 707 GW, led by Asia, where China accounts for 254 GW of the regional total of 406 GW. At the other end of the scale, Bhutan has no PV capacity as it generates more than 99% of its electricity from hydro facilities.
Europe, which generates 49.8% of its electricity from renewables, boasted 161 GW of PV capacity, with Germany contributing 53.8 GW, according to IRENA. The Faroe Islands is the only nation in Europe without any PV capacity, according to the report.
North America is the third biggest region for PV, with the U.S. supplying 73.8 GW of its 82.8 GW of photovoltaic projects and hydro-reliant Canada only 3.33 GW.
Australia hosts virtually all of its region's PV, reaching 17.63 GW of the regional 17.98 GW at the end of the year. New Zealand is the next biggest market, with 142 MW, and tiny Niue and 88%-clean-power Tokelau, along with Papua New Guinea, have only 1 MW of photovoltaic projects each. Brazil dominates South American solar, with 7.88 GW of the region's 12.67 GW of photovoltaic capacity. Paraguay and disputed British territory the Malvinas islands have no solar generation capacity, with the former almost entirely reliant on hydro.
South Africa supplied 5.49 GW of its continent's 9.5 GW of solar capacity with IRENA estimating there was no on-grid solar capacity in hydro-powered Lesotho or in Sao Tome et Principe, Equatorial Guinea, Djibouti, Chad or the Central African Republic.
The 6.67 GW of solar capacity in Turkey dominated the 8.23 GW installed in Eurasia by the end of the year, with another hydro-powered state, Georgia, having just 1 MW of solar arrays. The UAE accounted for 2.44 GW of the Middle East‘s 6.52 photovoltaic capacity, with war-torn Syria estimated to have just 2 MW of operational, grid-connected facilities. The nations of Dominica, Montserrat and the British Virgin Islands had no solar capacity at the end of the year, according to IRENA, in a Central America and Caribbean region which hosted 2.39 GW, led by Honduras‘ 514 MW of installed capacity. The French overseas territory of Saint Barthélemy and the island of St Martin–split between France and the Netherlands, similarly, had no grid-connected solar at the end of the year.
IRENA also estimated the world reached 4.31 GW of off-grid solar capacity in 2020, with India the only gigawatt nation, thanks to 1.13 GW of non grid-connected facilities. That figure was unchanged from 2019 whereas Kazakhstan added 199 MW of off-grid arrays last year to reach 807 MW as Asia reached 2.8 GW of standalone projects. Africa is the only other gigawatt scale off-grid market, according to IRENA, with 1.05 GW of projects, 423 MW of them in Algeria.
Some 2.8 MW of off-grid solar was added despite the conflict in Yemen last year to take the nation to 253 MW of such facilities, with the Middle East hosting 306 MW of off-grid projects.
Peru supplied 45.7 MW of South America's 86.4 MW of off-grid solar capacity and the Dominican Republic 21 MW of the standalone generation facilities in Central America and the Caribbean. The 3.2 MW of off-grid solar in French Polynesia made the biggest contribution to the 18.9 MW installed across Oceania.

After several years of R&D, France-based PV module maker Systovi has launched Stock-O, a water heater equipped with a battery that can store surplus electricity produced by solar panels to optimize household self-consumption.
With a capacity of 200 liters, Stock-O consists of three resistors that heat the water, regardless of the weather. Hot water production is triggered as soon as excess electricity is detected.
The water heater, which is controlled by a specific application, is also equipped with a weather forecasting system that can calculate the amount of energy that needs to be stored. For example, for sunny forecasts, Stock-O reduces the amount of hot water heated by the network at night, so it can store the predicted surpluses on the following day.
The device can purportedly perform several heating cycles per day.
“Less expensive than a lithium battery, it can store up to 10 kWh daily, which is the consumption of a four-member family,” the company said.
Around 10.80 kWh of the 17.50 kWh of electricity produced by a typical household is generally consumed, for an average self-consumption rate of 38%. But by heating the water with this system, the amount of consumed electricity increases to 15.70 kWh, for a 69% self-consumption rate.

Spanish solar tracker manufacturer PVH has launched a new tracking system specifically designed to be compatible with large-format modules.
“The Monoline + tracker can be easily installed on any type of terrain,” the company told pv magazine. “It is also suitable for bifacial modules and is compatible with a wide variety of modules from various manufacturers.”
PVH also explained that the tracker was developed in static and aeroelastic wind tunnels, and tested at the company's innovation center in Cheste, near Valencia. “It is a robust solar tracking system which offers a notable improvement in power production and a greater adaptability in different terrains and conditions, especially in its 2P configuration, thanks to its shorter rows.”
The Valencian manufacturer added that Monoline + benefits from advanced solar tracking algorithms and uses long-range communication technology based on the LoRa spread spectrum modulation technique.
Founded in 2011, PVH has supplied more than 10 GW of products to photovoltaic plants operating in various countries around the world. PVH is the third-largest supplier of solar trackers worldwide and is present in Europe, the Middle East, the United States, and Africa.

Pine Gate Renewables plans to bring 9 MW of solar+-storage to southeastern Massachusetts, under the state’s Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program, with a twist on traditional agrivoltaics.
The projects will be built over cranberry bogs, in the first such installation known to pv magazine.
The 9 MW of solar capacity and corresponding storage will be divvied across two projects in Carver, about an hour southeast of Boston. Solar Carver 1 will be built on a 70-acre site and will generate 6 MW of solar energy, accompanied by 24 MWh of battery storage. Solar Carver 3 will have a capacity of 3 MW and house a 12 MWh battery storage system across a 35-acre site.
Pine Gate’s EPC team will engineer the projects to rest on more than two dozen 40-foot-long wooden utility poles, which are expected to be more durable for the wet terrain. The poles will be driven 15-30 feet into the ground to keep the trackers at least 10 feet above the cranberry bogs and allow for annual harvesting.
The two installations also were selected for observation as part of a University of Massachusetts-Amherst study on the dual-use solar projects’ inter-row solar panel spacing atop the cranberry bogs.
Carver Solar 1 and 3 also mark Pine Gate Renewables’ first projects in Massachusetts.

Alberta Solar One – a 36,500-panel, 13.7 MW project that uses Morgan Solar’s SimbaX technology – is now in full operation.
Silfab Solar manufactured the panels, which use optical film to boost PV generation. The approach redirects and concentrates otherwise discarded light onto the PV cells.
Morgan Solar said it is working with partners on variants that can be incorporated into buildings and mitigate the impact of single-axis tracker shading on bifacial modules. The company said the films can be formatted for use in any panel manufacturer’s production processes.
Morgan Solar develops light management solutions and sensors for the utility solar and building markets. It was established in 2007 and is based in Toronto, Canada.
The Alberta project was co-developed by Enbridge and Morgan Solar, with CAD 10 million ($7.96 million) in support from Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) and Sustainable Development Technology Canada. ERA was created in 2009 to help Alberta deliver on the province’s environmental and economic goals. ERA has committed CAD 646 million toward 204 projects worth CAD 4.5 billion.
