TÜV Rheinland announced it will open a new laboratory for solar module testing in Taicang, near Shanghai, China.
The German certification body said the new lab will be located at the Yangtze River Delta Operation Hub, which is now under construction, and will have a total surface of around 12,000 m2.
“These include a more than 5,000-square-meter laboratory for testing photovoltaic modules and a more than 2,000-square-meter laboratory for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing,” TÜV Rheinland said in a statement. “There is also a 4,000-square-meter laboratory for EMC testing specifically of automotive electronics and automotive parts, as type testing of autonomous vehicle systems as well as electric vehicles is becoming increasingly important.”
In further expansion, TÜV Rheinland is planning to create a laboratory space totaling 37,000 m2 there by the end of 2023. This will make the facility the company's largest laboratory site in China, and incorporate testing for electronic products, automotive parts, and autonomous vehicle systems as well.
So far, 150 additional jobs have been created in Taicang, after the complete expansion up to 500 employees will work there. The site will be closely integrated into the testing company's worldwide laboratory network.
“For TÜV Rheinland, the Yangtze River Delta Operation Hub is one of the largest single investments in recent years,” says CEO Michael Fübi, adding that the project shows the importance that TÜV Rheinland attaches to the Chinese market. “With our safety and quality tests, we support Chinese customers entering global markets.”

Spanish renewable energy company Acciona has commissioned a 125 MW solar complex in Almendralejo, in the Spanish southern province of Badajoz, in the autonomous community of Extremadura.
Construction on the Extremadura I, II and III photovoltaic field started in November 2021.
The company invested around €80 million ($87.0 million) in the project, which relies on 234,640 solar panels provided by an undisclosed manufacturer, each rated at 540 W.
The construction works of Extremadura I, II and III have brought to light a series of archaeological remains, among which a group of Chalcolithic settlements from more than 5,000 years ago stands out. The company affirms that it has been adapting the design and configuration of its photovoltaic project to ensure the protection and preservation of the remains.
Acciona Energía says that “it has worked hand in hand with archaeologists, specialists in heritage conservation and the General Directorate of Cultural Heritage of the Junta de Extremadura to locate, demarcate and safeguard the 11 sites found that represent 30 hectares of archaeological protection”.

After having published the agronomic results on viticulture and arboriculture, French agrivoltaic specialist Sun'Agri has now unveiled a report on a crop of eggplants grown in the Brinkhoff agrivoltaic greenhouse in Granges-sur-Lot, in the region of Lot-et-Garonne.
Commissioned in September 2020, the 2500 m² facility meets the needs of the operator to adapt production to ever greater climatic hazards. The increase in the average temperature in greenhouses (30 C in spring and 40C in summer) causes burns on flowers and acceleration of the development of new pests.
One year after commissioning, the first results showed higher yields under the panels compared to a reference area without modules. More than 800 kg of vegetables were harvested under the device compared to around 500 kg for the reference area. Furthermore, eggplants harvested under panels have a higher biomass, synonymous with better development of the plant.
“We are pleased that this feedback from the Brinkhoff greenhouse confirms in the field the benefits of dynamic agrivoltaics for market gardening and greenhouse crops,” said Cécile Magherini, director of Sun’Agri. “Beyond being a tool for adaptation and resilience in the face of climate challenges for the farmer, intelligent management of our technology makes it possible to optimize agricultural production.”
The group has equipped the crops with three types of sensors for a detailed analysis of their condition and the consideration of meteorological factors. Micro-meteorological sensors placed at different heights of the plant measure air temperature, humidity, wind, and radiation.
Moreover, Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR ) sensors measure the active radiation for photosynthesis, making it possible to estimate the growth of the plant and its needs using the models.  “Plant sensors” make it possible to observe the behavior of the plant (water status, functioning, stress, organ temperature) and to optimize its well-being in real time.
“We grow various vegetables under these louvers without needing to bleach the greenhouses in the summer. With two years of hindsight, there is less pressure from pests such as aphids. The upcoming harvests will allow us to confirm and complete the first encouraging results of this tool,” stated Youp Brinkhoff, manager of the farm.
Since the greenhouse was commissioned, nine fruits and vegetables have been grown: tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplants, peppers, celery, fennel, spinach, lamb's lettuce and green beans.

“We will continue with the pre-qualification for the construction procurement at the beginning of February,” the company's CTO,  Sander Astor, said in a statement. “We aim to finalize the tender process by the end of 2023 and start construction on the project in the summer of 2024.”
The development of the project began in 2009 and in 2012 it was included in the 10-year network development plan drafted by the European Network of Transmission System Operators (Entso-E). The company conducted then the environmental assessment and environmental studies between 2016 and 2018, with the geological investigations having been done between 2019 and 2021.
The storage facility is planned to have a storage capacity of 6 GWh during one storage cycle of 12 hours.
According to Entso-E, the project is based on a semi-loop concept, with the upper reservoir being the Finnish Gulf hosting sea water with very low salinity and the lower reservoir being a cavern in depth of -550m in the granite body. “It consists of an underground reservoir in crystal underground rock, chafers connecting it to the ground and to the seabed, and other land-based objects,” the company explained.
The latest edition of pv magazine considers how industry heavyweights are increasingly planning gigawatt-scale assets, looks at the huge potential repowering could unlock for German solar, and examines how solar can help trucking companies in the energy transition. A packed edition also features a focus on the Middle East.
The commissioning of the facility is scheduled for 2029. The project originally received funding of €650 million, as an EU Project of Common Interest.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/25/us-startup-begins-producing-40-efficient-thermophotovoltaic-cells/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 25, 2023",US startup begins producing 40%-efficient thermophotovoltaic cells,"Antora Energy has started production at its 2 MW thermophotovoltaic cell factory in Sunnyvale, California.
“The cells are based on III-V semiconductors, which have a higher performance than conventional solar cells, and produce 100 times more power than similarly sized devices,” CEO Andrew Ponec told pv magazine. “The cells can convert any source of high temperature heat into electricity and their most important application is for energy storage,” he added referring to thermal energy grid storage (TEGS) consisting of a low-cost, grid-scale energy storage technology that uses TPVs to convert heat to electricity above 2,000 C.
Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) is a power generation technology that uses thermal radiation to generate electricity in photovoltaic cells. A TPV system generally consists of a thermal emitter that can reach high temperatures, near or beyond 1,000 C, and a photovoltaic diode cell that can absorb photons coming from the heat source.
The technology has drawn the interest of scientists for decades, because it is able to capture sunlight in the entire solar spectrum and has the technical potential to beat the Shockley-Queisser limit of traditional photovoltaics. However, the efficiencies reported thus far have been too low to make it commercially viable, as TPV devices still suffer from optical and thermal losses.
“Until now, TPV technology has met neither the efficiency threshold required to compete with traditional heat engines nor the manufacturability threshold required to produce the technology at scale,” said Antora Energy. “Now, Antora has met both of these critical thresholds, demonstrating heat-to-electricity conversion efficiencies greater than 40%, and demonstrating the capability to manufacture TPV at scale.”
The startup said it has secured funding from the California Energy Commission to build the TPV manufacturing line in California in 2021.
“Some of Antora’s earliest funding was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to develop TPV technology in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Arizona State University,” said the company.
In April, a group of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) unveiled a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cell featuring III–V materials with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 eV. This cell achieved an efficiency of 41.1% operating at a power density of 2.39 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,400 C. The group presented the device in “Thermophotovoltaic efficiency of 40%,” which was recently published in Nature.

They are also meeting much of the rising demand for electricity, which is growing three times faster (2.7% per year over the 2011-21 period) than the global population.
Soon there will be large-scale electrification of transport, heating and industry – the “electrification of everything,” or the comeback of “tout-électrique.” This will lead to double or triple demand for electricity. Solar and wind will also meet this new load.
Image: ISES
Fossil fuels cause three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions. But in most countries, solar and wind are being installed at a much faster rate than new coal plants (Figure 2). Excluding China, global coal capacity has been falling for several years, as older power stations shut down faster than new power stations open. The paucity of new coal capacity means that the world is at peak coal.
Image: ISES
Solar and wind have passed 1 TW of installed capacity. The deployment of PV and wind is increasing exponentially. Cumulative installed solar capacity will overtake wind soon.
Global installed solar capacity has grown by a factor of 500 over the past 20 years. In 1985, when the current PV industry workhorse, PERC technology, was still an innovation that would take another 20 years to flourish, the total annual production of PV modules was less than 25 MWp. Today, many of the individual Tier 1 PV module manufacturers produce 25 MWp/day.
The growth rate in annual deployment rate in recent years has been about 18%. Projecting this growth rate forward shows that installed solar capacity will pass the combined total of nuclear, hydro, gas and coal in 2031 (Figure 3).
Image: ISES
Electricity consumption in developed regions such Europe, North America, Japan and Australia has reached between 7 MWh and 15 MWh per person per year. The electrification of transport, heating and industry to get rid of fossil fuels involves a doubling of electricity demand or more, depending on a country's participation in the chemical industry. Electricity consumption in developed countries could therefore hit 20 MWh per person per year by the middle of the century.
The global population in mid-century is projected to be about 10 billion people. An affluent and fully electrified global economy with zero fossil fuels will therefore require about 200,000 TWh of electricity per year.
Solar has a far larger resource base than any other generation source and will have to provide most future energy – for example, 60% of total future energy, or 120,000 TWh. This equates to a requirement for about 75 TW of solar, assuming an average capacity factor of 18%. We need to reach an annual installation rate of 4 TW per year by the mid-2030s to achieve this by the middle of the century. The current growth rate in annual PV deployment is nearly enough to achieve this.
Global pathfinding is important to show what is possible. Australia is generating twice as much solar electricity per capita than any other gigawatt-scale electricity system (Figure 4). The government target for the National Electricity Market for 2030 is 82% renewable electricity (mostly solar and wind).
Australia is located at a low-moderate latitude, along with most of the global population. Australia is demonstrating that the rapid deployment of solar and wind is compatible with affordable electricity prices and a stable electricity grid.
Large-scale energy storage in the form of pumped hydro energy storage is an off-the-shelf, low-cost, low-impact technology that has already been deployed at a scale of 200 GW. It is available at unlimited scale nearly everywhere.
The ANU Global PHES Atlas lists 616,000 off-river (closed loop) sites with a combined storage capacity of 23 million GWh, which is about 50 times more than needed to support a global 100% renewable energy system.
In response to the rapid rise of solar and wind, the Australian government has announced 15 GW of pumped hydro storage, which is far more than any other country on a per capita basis.

They said they are trying to clarify the many models and assumptions that are used by academics to determine LCoE values for PV technologies.
“The variety of reported values, produced by different models, hinders the comparison between commercial and emerging PV technologies,” they said. “Despite similar lifetime and efficiency inputs, a huge spread of LCoE values was reported in 2021, due to different calculation and assumption approaches.”
The scientists noted the difficulty of providing final clear values for perovskite solar panels, as cell-to-module (CTM) efficiency losses occur when scaling up from the lab to the factory.
“Overall, these losses in performance have a negative impact on the determination of the LCoE for perovskite PVs, which is worsened by the lack of information regarding the performances of standard-sized modules,” they explained, noting that there is still much to be done with regard to increasing panel size. “The currently certified record efficiency of 25.7% is attained on a 0.096 cm2 area cell and the largest active area recorded for a perovskite solar module is 802 cm2 with an efficiency of 17.8%.”
The team presented LCoE models developed by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), among others, to show all variables and assumptions. The scientists also noted the importance of defining a common approach to assessing the LCoE of perovskite PV systems.
“The refinement of the assumptions regarding manufacturing costs and financial parameters is a critical factor for enabling a more reliable determination of LCoE values,” they said.
They suggested including new parameters such as real module performance, the degradation rate, and the costs for industrial production.
“We showed that there is still a large uncertainty regarding the exact value of perovskite LCoE, even though several studies reported the LCoE in a range between $0.03/kWh and $0.06/kWh,” they said.
The scientists presented their findings in “The levelized cost of electricity from perovskite photovoltaics,” which was recently published in Energy & Environmental Science.
“Overall, in the next few years the LCoE calculations will be important to set the agenda for an early commercialization or a pivotal strategy towards other applications of halide perovskites,” they said.

The AUD 130 million ($92.3 million) Girgarre Solar Farm is expected to take around 18 months to construct. It will produce around 200 GWh of energy per year once operational, with 167,000 PV modules to be deployed, alongside civil and electrical infrastructure.
In 2019, the 93 MW project was sold to Enel Green Power, the Australian renewables unit of Italy's Enel Group. However, it appears that Leeson Group has maintained some level of involvement.
In mid 2022, it was widely reported Enel Group was looking to sell a substantial stake in Enel Green Power to help fund an estimated 3.6 GW development pipeline in the country. Credit Suisse was engaged to launch an auction for Enel Green Power’s Australian assets last August, and the Australian Financial Review reported that Enel was looking to sell off 50% to 80% of the portfolio.
Reports of bids emerged in August and ran through to September, but after that, news of the sale died out. It is not clear whether a major stake in Enel Green Power’s portfolio was eventually sold.
Either way, Enel Green Power has revealed that it has received initial approvals from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) for its first hybrid project in Australia – a 96 MW solar farm and 20 MW battery in the Central West and Orana Region of New South Wales. The company said it hopes to start construction on that project – located in one of the state’s first “renewable energy zones” – by the middle of the year.

It has also signed an agreement with India-based Synergy Consulting to secure support in negotiating with project lenders for debt financing, finalizing key agreements and power tariffs with potential offtakers, and raising capital.
“Following confirmation of excellent solar resources at our preferred Solar Project site location in Tete Mozambique, we have upgraded our existing exclusive land use rights,” said Ncondezi Energy CEO Hanno Pengilly. “This is a critical permitting requirement for the project, reflecting both strong local support and the expedited process we are executing since announcing the positive feasibility study last October.”
The 300 MW project will be built in two stages. For the first 100 MW phase, the company will use existing infrastructure. It is planning new infrastructure for the remaining 200 MW.
“Approval of the Solar Project Transmission Integration Study represents a key development milestone in de-risking the project for potential power off-takers and investors,” Pengilly said. “We have an approved transmission evacuation technical solution that supports the project at various sizes up to 300 MW, optimized in phases to reduce upfront capex, particularly for the first 100 MW.”
Ncondezi Energy is also developing a 300 MW coal-fired power plant and a mine development project in the Tete region.
Mozambique's solar installations stood at just 55 MW at the end of 2021, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). However, a number of major projects are currently in development. The country's overall electricity access rate was estimated at around 30% in 2019.
