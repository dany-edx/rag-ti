And the push for the commercialization of the technology has also focused on lead-containing materials, in particular methylammonium lead-triiodide.
Lead is only present in these materials in small amounts and unlikely to cause a serious environmental issue. However, the toxicity of the material has pushed many researchers to investigate alternatives. Varying the metal component in the perovskite can also allow researchers to tune the material to different bandgaps, a desirable feature for all perovskite tandem cells.
Tin-based perovskites are the closest behind lead, but the gap is still quite large with tin perovskites so far struggling to break the 10% mark. Researchers have stated that tin’s tendency to react with oxygen makes it a more difficult material to work with. New research from the Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology in Bhopal, India, however, finds that tin-based perovskites come with plenty of potential, provided the right combination of other cell materials and optimizations can be found.
Scientists at the institute modeled the performance of a 1cm² solar cell comprising methylammonium tin triiodide absorber, copper oxide hole transport layer, and titanium dioxide electron transport layer. Their simulations show that, with greatly reduced defect densities in the absorber layer, such a cell could reach as high as 28.39%.
The scientists accept that producing a material with such low defect density would not be easy, at values that have been observed experimentally the device reached 18.36%, and at only a slightly higher level it could be increased to 24.54%. The simulation also concludes that 500 nanometers is the optimal thickness for such a cell.
Full details of the various simulations carried out at the institute are found in the paper Device simulation of highly efficient eco-friendly CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite solar cell, published in Scientific Reports.
The research helps to reveal potential new pathways to optimizing tin-based perovskite solar cells, particularly in terms of ideal thickness and the materials for other cell layers. “Reducing the defect density and improving the Sn2+ stability of absorber layers are the critical issues for future research, which might be resolved by refining the device's fabrication techniques,” the scientists conclude. “The reported CH3NH3SnI3-based PSC provides a viable path to realizing environmentally benign, low-cost, and high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/11/hungarys-second-renewables-auction-concludes-with-lowest-bid-of-0-0549-kwh/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,HUNGARY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 11, 2021",Hungary’s second renewables auction concludes with lowest bid of $0.0549/kWh,"The Hungarian Energy and Public Utility Regulatory Authority (HEPURA) has published the list of the 36 renewable energy projects that were successful in the country’s second technology-neutral renewable energy auction, that was launched in October. Despite being open to several power generation technologies, 256 of the 257 projects that competed in the procurement exercise were relying on the PV source and the sole exception was a 0.5 MW geothermal plant.
For the small PVPP category, including installations between 300 kW and 1 MW, final prices varied from HUF21/kWh ($0.071) to HUF 23.03/kWh, while in the large PVPP group, including projects ranging in size from 1 MW to 49.9 MW, final prices ranged from HUF16.18/kWh ($0.0549) to HUF17.97/kWh. The average final price in the first category was HUF22.35 while, in the second one, it was HUF17.22.
For the smallest category, the HEPURA expects to contract 40 GWh and for the largest group, the contracted power should be around 350 GWh. For comparison, in the first, pilot renewable energy auction, held in March, the Hungarian authority had secured 33 GWh and 166 GWh, respectively.
“The results of the second tender clearly show that … the significant increase of the capacity limit, from 20 MW to 50 MW for large scale projects, had a favorable effect on foreign investor[s'] appetite,” Hungarian energy expert, Kinga Máté, told pv magazine. “In this regard, approximately 50% of the projects awarded in the bigger category were submitted by individual foreign investors or in the form of a joint venture in cooperation with one of the key players of the local market.”
According to another Hungarian renewable energy specialist, Ferenc Kis, the low prices seen in the auction may lay the ground for the birth of a PPA market in Hungary, although the current energy regulation does not contemplate a similar option. “The Hungarian renewable energy market is still hindered by a tax that supports small district-heat producers,” he told pv magazine. “Based on the shorter contract for difference period and close-to-market prices in the present auction, the unsuccessful bidders may wait for [a change in] the unfavorable renewable energy tax and head toward the 50-100 MW scale, to build purely merchant projects in the coming years.”
HEPURA is granting 15-year feed-in premium payments to the successful projects, to top up wholesale electricity prices. The tender is part of the Hungarian government's METAR-KÁT renewables incentive program, which was launched in 2017. The European Commission approved the scheme in July 2019.

The main objective of the consortium is outlining draft recommendations on the application of power electronics and on the design and operation of co-located solar and wind facilities. “The aim is to maximize the energy yield and limit the stresses on, and failures of electrical components,” said the Netherlands research entity in a statement.
TNO researcher Nico Dekker explained that, in an ideal hybrid project, the wind turbines should be located in the northern project area and the solar park in the southern part, to avoid any kind of shading coming from the wind tower or the wind turbine blades. “However, this is not always possible, resulting in shade from the wind turbines on the solar panels,” he stated.
According to the TNO, the shadow caused by the wind unit moves slowly over the solar plant and good project design may easily incorporate this movement. “However, relatively little is known about the dynamic, rapidly moving shadow, which is why we are going to investigate it,” Dekker further explained, adding that a dynamic shadow may determine much higher performance losses than a slow one. “Application of the right power electronics can reduce this effect and thus also limit the additional load on the installation,” he added.
The research group has already taken high-frequency measurements at two operational solar parks operated by Vattenfall and Solarfields. That of the Swedish energy company is likely a 38 MW/22 MW wind-solar plant that was announced in August 2019, and that is also integrating a 12 MW storage system. “TNO's simulation models will be used to determine the effect of slowly moving and rapidly moving shading on the performance of, and stresses on solar panels and power electronics such as inverters,” Dekker further explained.
In its statement, the TNO said it would like to involve more projects in the study and that interested solar plant owners can contact the institution through its website.

The European Parliament yesterday voted to formally approve the €672.5 billion RRF budget which forms the central plank of its Next Generation EU Covid recovery strategy.
The heads of EU member states who make up the European Council of Ministers now need to formally sign off the budget – the terms of which they thrashed out with the parliament in December – so the presidents of the parliament and of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) of the Council of Ministers can sign the policy into force. ECOFIN is composed of member states' economic and finance ministers.
The European Commission yesterday welcomed the vote by the parliament and said it expected the RRF to be approved this month. After approval, member states will be able to submit national RRF plans for scrutiny and will be able to access 13% ‘pre-financing' of the funds allocated to them. With the RRF insisting at least 37% of all the cash disbursed be spent on ‘climate objectives', at least €7.47 billion of that initial €20.2 billion pre-financing slice of funds must be devoted to that end.
A green transition is one of six pillars of the RRF fund, along with digital transformation; economic cohesion, productivity and competitiveness; social and territorial cohesion; health, economic, social and institutional resilience; and policies for the next generation. The RRF also stipulates at least 20% of the cash be devoted to digital investment.

Having secured a feed-in tariff (FIT) under the FIT 2 regime, which ran from April to the end of December, Sunseap yesterday said it installed almost 60,000 panels plus 370 inverters on factory and warehouse rooftops in southern provinces including Ba Ria Vung Tau, Dong Nai, Binh Phoc and Binh Duong.
Sunseap CEO and co-founder Frank Phuan, in a press release issued by the company, said: “It was no mean feat installing and commissioning seven solar plants in Vietnam within three months, and in the face of the pandemic-related travel restrictions and supply disruptions. We hope this demonstrates to our partners and potential partners Sunseap's strong end-to-end project development and management competencies and our ability to complete a project within a tight deadline.”
The arrays will supply power to state power company Vietnam Electricity under a 20-year power purchase agreement. As pv magazine reported in April, the FIT 2 program offered a solar rooftop payment of $0.0838/kWh.
The developer said it expects the systems to generate 40.4 GWh per year for the Vietnamese grid. Developers were last year critical of the time frames involved in qualifying for the new payments, with projects having to be commissioned this year to be eligible. However, Phuan said: “The Vietnamese government has been incredibly supportive of clean energy and we look forward to more opportunities to power the country's economic growth in a sustainable manner.”
In a separate development, Bangkok-based developer Constant Energy said it had secured its first corporate power purchase agreement-driven installation at the end of December, for a 1 MWp system in Binh Duong province.
The array, which was jointly developed with Bach Khoa Solar Group subsidiary Solar Esco, will supply power to apparel manufacturer Leading Star Garment joint stock company.
Constant Energy yesterday announced it had closed the VND8.9 billion ($388,000) finance for the array with the Indovina Bank joint venture established by the state-owned Vietnam Bank for Industry and Trade and Taiwanese commercial lender Cathay United Bank.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/11/us-scientists-claim-pv-system-owners-subsidize-their-non-pv-neighbors/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 11, 2021",US scientists claim PV system owners subsidize their non-PV neighbors,"One of the most common arguments against supporting PV and other renewables through public incentives is that those power consumers that do not install a clean energy power generator are the most affected, as they have to bear the cost of the incentives without enjoying the benefits and financial advantages that the renewable energy systems can ensure. This argument has been used in the past, and often with success, by government, power utilities, and regulators to slow down or stop the advance of PV, especially among homeowners and small and medium-sized businesses.
A research group from Michigan Technological University has now sought to shed light on the true value of solar power generated by net-metered PV systems in the United States, and has found that non-PV consumers enjoy more benefits than commonly thought.
In the study A review of the value of solar methodology with a case study of the U.S. VOS, published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, the scientists explained that their value estimations for grid-tied photovoltaic systems have proven that solar panels are beneficial not only for electric utilities but also for electricity consumers. “Anyone who puts up solar is being a great citizen for their neighbors and for their local utility,” research co-author Joshua Pearce said. “Customers with solar distributed generation are making it so utility companies don't have to make as many infrastructure investments while, at the same time, solar shaves down peak demands when electricity is the most expensive.”
The academics explained that utility customers that own a rooftop solar array are under-compensated in most of the states as what they called the “value of solar” eclipses the net metering tariffs paid by the utilities. The U.S. group developed a model that takes into account realistic costs and liabilities utility companies can avoid with an increasing share of rooftop PV capacity.
The model considers the following variables: Avoided operation and maintenance costs; avoided fuel; avoided generation capacity; avoided reserve capacity; avoided grid capacity; and environmental and health liability costs due to fossil fuel power generation.
“It can be concluded that substantial future regulatory reform is needed to ensure that grid-tied solar PV owners are not unjustly subsidizing U.S. electric utilities,” Pearce affirmed. “This study provides greater clarity to decision makers so they see solar PV is truly an economic benefit in the best interest of all utility customers.”

The Israeli company secured 166 MWh of storage capacity across five solar projects in the procurement exercise, which saw the authorities assign 608.95 MW of PV capacity to seven developers across 33 projects.
“We secured 120 MWh and 20 MWh in two fixed 23-year PPA projects submitted by Israeli developer Solegreen and a further 20 MWh for a solar plant planned by French energy company EDF,” Augwind CEO Or Yogev told pv magazine. “Furthermore, we secured 1 MWh and 5 MWh with Israeli companies Yahel and Meyram for behind-the-meter applications in industrial parks.”

Augwind will build the projects at a fixed tariff of ILS 0.1745 ($0.0544)/kWh, which will ensure their bankability, while providing better investment returns than behind-the-meter projects relying on lithium-ion storage, Yogev claimed. The company's energy storage tech will generate recurring revenues based on two factors.
“First, offsetting off-peak to peak electricity consumption and, secondly, providing all compressed air requirements using 40% more efficient compression cycle,” Yogev explained.
Yogev said that Augwind's solution is cost-effective for power generators with minimum capacities of 1 MW and four hours of storage. It relies on a stationary storage technique that has been in use for years, with a focus on the use of compressed air to optimize the efficiency of industrial facilities.
“Compressed air can be used to generate power,” he said. “It can also be utilized for the common compressed air needs of any manufacturing facility.”
Augwind has developed a patented air-compression method that purportedly produces compressed air at a much higher efficiency level than in standard compressors.
“This core technology is already implemented with the AirSmart system for industrial energy efficiency applications in over 60 installations in Israel and abroad, including PepsiCo in California,” Yogev said.
It has already used its AirBattery energy storage systems for short-term and seasonal electricity storage applications.
“I would define our core technology as an enabler for both high capacity energy storage and industrial compressed air services,” Yogev said. “Or a hybrid system that is ideal for each factory in the world that needs a clean, cheap renewable-based power supply and a more efficient compressed air process.”
The main components in Augwind's storage system are AirX inflatable polymer tanks. The company outsources production of this patented technology to third parties. The tanks are covered by steel frames, which create a sort of cage around them.
Image: Augwind
“These structures are intended at supporting the weight of the ground when the polymer tanks are empty,” Yogev said. “So these tanks are designed not only to sustain internal pressure but also external pressure.”
The caged inflatable balloons are placed in holes at a depth of 4 meters. The company then pours a cement-based material around the tanks to fill all the gaps created by the inflatable balloons.
Once the installation of the tanks has been completed, they are no longer visible, but are accessible for maintenance purposes via manhole covers. Once everything solidifies, the polymer tanks adhere to the walls of their respective cages. These cavities each contain 60-cubic-meter polymer tanks that can store compressed air at a pressure of 40 bar.
Augwind's system is based on two compression tanks that are placed in the ground close to each other, in addition to a series of storage tanks. The tanks are each 13 meters in length, with a width of 2.5 meters. The power produced by utility-scale PV arrays or wind farms can be used to power standard water pumps, which inject water into the compression tanks. The tanks are sealed, so the air they contain starts to be compressed up to the top, and then shifts to the storage tanks. With on-demand energy, the compressed air is released from the storage tanks to drive a powerful water turbine, which is used to generate electricity.
Yogev explained that compressing air at 40 bar with a standard mechanical piston would generate temperatures of around 800 C, which would make the operation of the battery more complex and less efficient.
“Instead, with our technology, the air is compressed with water and the heat produced by the compression is dissipated into the water itself,” he explained. “We created a process in which we compress the air without generating any heat and this isothermal process has a 100% efficiency, as there is no loss of energy consumed by the pump.”
Yogev claimed that Augwind is the first company to achieve such isothermal conditions in compressed air storage technologies.
He said that heat dissipation is also possible due to the big polymer tanks that are used to store compressed air, as well as the special concrete mixture used to cover the underground tanks.
“The concrete we use, which is also a company's patented technology, is able to levelize itself inside the hole while pouring into all small cracks and voids,” Yogev explained. “The mixture we use cannot only help the system sustain external and internal pressure but has also thermal properties that enable a very efficient compression cycle.”
Charging cycle
One of the two compression tanks is used for air storage, while the second one is used for the compression cycle. When the first tank is filled with enough water, it is pumped into the second tank. This recirculates water back and forth, so it can be reused for indefinite periods of time, with minimal water consumption.
“The beauty of this system is that it also produces water,” Yogev said, noting the system can pull water from the air. “It is because the air has always some residual moisture inside and when you compress it you also generate some water.”
The compressed air is then stored in nearby storage tanks. Their number can be increased according to the desired storage capacity.
Discharging cycle
Water is used to pump the air in the charging process, as the interaction of water and air generates minimal heat. In the discharging process, the 40 bar of compressed air can produce a water jet that can push the water up to 400 meters in the air, according to Augwind. This water is pumped into a hydro turbine, which are smaller versions of the turbines used in pumped hydro plants, in order to reproduce electricity.
“Compressed air is the energy and water is just the medium,” Yogev said, noting that the system can produce more electricity if more pressure is applied.
“The more the energy will be pressurized in the tank, the cheaper the energy will be that we will produce out of it,” he added.
When it is coupled with PV power production, the entire underground system can be covered by the panels. There is zero impact on the module temperatures, as the minimal heat produced in the isothermal compression process is completely absorbed by the concrete mixture.

Pumped hydro
Augwind claims that its technology is safe, with zero risk of explosions.
“The only risk is leakage, and it means some air will be leaked to the ground,” Yogev said, adding that this issue can be easily resolved with quick repairs. “Our solution is similar to groundworks – we don't use any polluting materials, we use air and closed-circled water as raw materials and our carbon footprint is very limited, the system can be installed underground functional areas, this means that you can build your generation facility or a data center for example on top of the subterranean storage tanks.”
The solution is also modular, which means it can be deployed for 10 MWh or 100 MWh systems with the simple addition of more polymer tanks. Yogev said the technology works like common pumped hydro storage, with the only difference being that the systems can be quickly installed almost anywhere, on a bigger or smaller scale, with a relatively small footprint, and at much lower capex levels. “And you don't need a water reservoir,” he added.
Image: Augwind
The company said the storage solution has an efficiency of 80%. It claimed that this compares to an efficiency rate of up to 90% for lithium-ion storage. Despite the lower efficiency levels, the compressed air solution purportedly has a lifecycle of more than 40 years, with minimal degradation over an unlimited number of cycles. This compares to an average lifecycle of 12 years and 4,000 cycles for lithium-ion batteries.
“We have a clear path for cost reductions going forward and that is something that traditional pumped hydro cannot have,” Yogev said.
Augwind also said that its technology is considerably cheaper than conventional compressed air storage solutions, or storage in salt caverns. Yogev claimed that salt storage only makes sense with massive, gigawatt-scale projects.
“Our business model is applicable to wind and solar energy projects ranging in size from a few megawatts to several dozens of megawatts, for which conventional technologies for compressed air storage are not applicable,” he said.

The University of New South Wales (UNSW) has established a team of researchers led by Scientia Professor Rose Amal from the School of Chemical Engineering to develop a roadmap exercise in the potential to use excess renewable energy to make fuel, chemicals and feedstocks for New South Wales (NSW) infrastructure. 
The NSW Power-to-X (P2X) Industry Feasibility Study, will look at opportunities in the NSW infrastructural makeup to use excess renewable energy from solar, wind, and other sources to decarbonize and grow local manufacturing. 
P2X technologies are technologies that can be utilized to store surplus renewable energy as chemical energy, such as using excess solar to produce a clean fuel like green hydrogen, ammonia, methane, etc. This is useful because such chemical energies are far easier to store than electricity. 
UNSW is right at the forefront of this research, only last month chemical engineers from UNSW and the University of Sydney made a significant technological breakthrough in the development of green ammonia. The researchers were able to produce green ammonia from air, water, and solar energy in a fashion that does not require high temperatures, high pressures, or enormous amounts of infrastructure.
Amal says the processes of producing such chemicals is energy-intensive, but that that is exactly why cheap renewable energy from solar is employed to keep costs down. “NSW has untapped renewable energy potential that presents excellent opportunities to build a P2X industry at scale, – to meet domestic and export demand for green energy,” says Amal, “P2X offers opportunities for deep decarbonization for hard-to-abate industries, regional development and investment attraction, as well as exporting renewable energy to overseas markets via hydrogen carriers.” 
“Countries such as Germany, Japan and South Korea are already seeking partners and locations in Australia for renewable hydrogen production, to export to their respective countries,” continued Amal, “NSW has all the ingredients required for a future hydrogen economy and a rare opportunity to lead the P2X development. But we must act urgently and invest in the technology and start building capabilities now, to ensure we capture this enormous opportunity for our state and our country.” 
NSW Chief Scientist & Engineer Hugh Durrant-Whyte added that a P2X industry would greatly accelerate the hydrogen economy in the state and provide substantial economic and environmental benefits.
“There is an existing demand for hydrogen and a growing market for other P2X products overseas, in NSW and across Australia,” said Durrant-Whyte, who stressed that the transport, electricity and gas industries are already actively searching for P2X solutions as a way of effectively decarbonizing their processes and products. 
“A local P2X industry could play a major role in NSW’s target of net zero emissions by 2050 and create hundreds of jobs,” said Durrant-Whyte, who seconded Amal’s call for immediate, targeted and coordinated investment in these technologies. 
Amal’s research team will include members from UNSW Sydney, University of Newcastle, University of Wollongong, University of Sydney and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

Enphase Energy reported a 67% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in Q4 2020, driven by what it said was strong demand for microinverter systems across all regions.
It also reported the success of the Enphase Encharge storage system, shipments of which increased roughly 35% in Q4, compared to the Q3.
In total, Enphase reported revenues of $264.8 million in Q4 and $774.4 million for all of 2020. The performance improved on what was a difficult Q2 for the company. The company reported Q2 revenue of $125.5 million, and a GAAP gross margin of 38.5%.
The company said that $217.5 of its Q4 revenue came from the United States, up from  $139.9 million during Q3.
Enphase also reported what it said was record microinverter system sell-through from distributors to installers during the fourth quarter, resulting in lower than usual channel inventory at the end of the quarter. The sell-through rate led to Enphase shipping almost 2.3 million microinverters in Q4, representing around 762 MWdc.
(Read “Is Enphase poised to challenge SolarEdge’s inverter lead?“)
Also recognized on the earnings call was Enphase’s recent acquisition of Sofdesk Inc., a provider of design software for residential solar installers and roofing companies. The company also mentioned its recent agreement to acquire the Solar Design Services business of DIN Engineering Services.
The company said these acquisitions are expected to enhance the company’s digital platform capabilities, simplify the sales process, and improve the buying experience for homeowners.
Fueled by a second straight quarter of higher engineering and sales headcount, non-GAAP operating expenses rose to $34.2 million in Q4. That was up from $29.6 million reported in the prior quarter. Overall, Enphase hired 105 new employees in the last three months of 2020. Enphase’s non-GAAP figures do not include the $16.5 million in tariff refunds on U.S. microinverter imports from China.
Enphase predicts that revenue will range between $280 million to $300 million. GAAP operating expenses are expected to range between $64.0 million to $67.0 million, including $22 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related costs and amortization. The figures include the Sofdesk acquisition, but not DIN’s Solar Design Services business.
The company also forecast a production ramp for its Encharge storage system during the first quarter. There was, however, no word on if the company expects to expand its Enphase Energized AC modules in markets beyond France and the Netherlands.
