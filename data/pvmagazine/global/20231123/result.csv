https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/23/ethiopias-renewable-energy-sector-hit-by-range-of-issues/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,ETHIOPIA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA",ANGELA SKUJINS,"NOVEMBER 23, 2023",Ethiopia’s renewable energy sector hit by range of issues,"Renewable energy academic Seife Ayele told pv magazine that some of the issues afflicting the Ethiopian government’s quest for procuring non-hydropower renewable energy projects include poor planning, unrealistic projects and “weak” human and institutional knowledge. Incomplete electricity sector improvements, “significant” project risks and a “weak” domestic private sector are also barriers, he said.
pv magazine asked the Ministry of Water and Energy to comment on these critiques but did not get a response.
Ayele, a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies in the United Kingdom, and three other academics came to this conclusion after researching the Ethiopian government’s handling of non-hydro renewable energy procurements.
Culminated in a recently published research paper, the team conducted literary research, held workshops and interviewed over 40 non-government and government stakeholders, “informants” and CEOs of independent power producers (IPP) to try and understand the government’s process. The researchers were inspired after the government’s best efforts to ramp up the industry, which peaked in 2018 with the implementation of transparent auctions, failed, according to the paper.
“Many IPPs were attracted to the Ethiopian renewable energy sector, with at least five signing power purchase agreements,” the authors state in the report.
“Gad and Dicheto projects, won by Saudi Company ACWA Power, resulted in US$2.526 cents/kWh tariff agreements, and were celebrated as the cheapest in sub-Saharan Africa.
“However, at the time of writing and after a decade, none of the projects reached financial close and the volume of procurement dropped by more than 70 percent from the plan.”
The researchers used five renewable energy projects – three solar and two geothermal – as case studies and found “challenges and fault lines,” applicable to the whole sector, Ayele said. “Firstly, the projects that the government came up with were almost too ambitious in size.
“Number two was the actors involved in the program. There was tension, particularly between the Ethiopian Electric Power, the main generator, and the Ministry of Finance, who were governing this procurement process.”
The “fragmented” nature of government delayed projects, Ayele said, and government staff also lacked the necessary legal, financial and scientific skills to get projects off the ground. “They really needed to set up a good, strong team to engage with foreign companies, and that didn't happen at the beginning,” Ayele said.
Financial risks also made Ethiopia “problematic” for investors, he said, listing off examples such as converting Ethiopian currency into foreign currency and the availability of foreign currency for expatriating profit. The war in northern Ethiopia also spooked investors and delayed the underground implementation of projects, Ayele said.
Last week, the CEO of the Africa Solar Industry Association, John van Zuylen, said, while speaking about solar in Mozambique, some project developers could be attracted to “risk” as it could mean “a higher level of return on their investment.” When put to Ayele, he refuted this saying the war, “certainly affected Ethiopia.”
Despite Ethiopia being resource-rich – it is just below the equator and receives ample wind – only half of the country’s population has access to electricity, according to World Bank.
Ethiopia’s estimated installed solar capacity has hovered at 21 MW for two years, according to the International Renewable Energy Association (IRENA). And although almost all of the country's energy in 2020 was sourced from renewables (88%), most of this (96%) was biomass. This is the burning of wood, dung, charcoal and crop residue, a 2014 report states. Hydropower produced the remaining 4% of renewable energy in 2020, which generated just under 5 GW.
Ayele said the government wants everyone connected to the grid, but this is a “monumental task” given the current state of the energy sector. He believes that fostering the domestic energy sector could fill the energy gap as it is a flexible resource that lends itself to smaller projects distributed across the country. Although Ayele predicts solar’s presence in Ethiopia will increase, electricity sector reforms and the introduction of a “bold” green industrial policy are required.
The paper, titled “Governance of renewable energy procurement via private suppliers: The Ethiopian experience”, was published in Energy Policy.

The ministry said that a central part of the program will be the deployment of at least 5 GW of solar capacity.
“We want to enhance the energy independent of the area, enabling it to act as an ‘energy island' in times of need,” the ministry said in a document. “Such island will be able to produce and consume electricity intendedly of the grid.”
The ministry said it is developing a multi-year program for the project. It aims to build 5 GW by 2030, including rooftop and ground-mounted PV systems. It also mentioned plans to build PV fences and bicycle lanes, as well as PV equipment production and energy storage solutions.
Some villages will become microgrids with buildings incorporating PV panels and storage units for self-sufficiency. The rebuilt structures will use high-energy-efficient materials. The program aims to develop electric car infrastructure, green public transportation, connect villages to natural gas, and upgrade water and sewerage systems.
The November edition of pv magazine is dominated by the issue of global oversupply and examines the effects of a solar glut in the European Union, the United States, and other markets.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/23/new-research-claims-pv-outperforms-afforestation-in-combating-climate-change/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CENTRAL & SOUTH AMERICA,EUROPE,GERMANY,ISRAEL,MIDDLE EAST,PANAMA,WESTERN EUROPE",LIOR KAHANA,"NOVEMBER 23, 2023",New research claims PV outperforms afforestation in combating climate change,"Researchers from Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science have compared how ground-mounted PV and land afforestation may compete in fighting climate change and have found the former may have better chances.
For their simulations, the scientists created a new metric that they called “break-even time” (BET). It calculates the time the two technologies may need to have an effect on carbon emissions and offset the warming impacts caused by the darkening of land.
“PV electricity can significantly contribute to decrease anthropogenic carbon emissions. Forest restoration can play an important complementary role in climate change mitigation efforts by providing an immediate means for actively removing atmospheric carbon,” the researchers said, “However, both have a high land area demand, which may lead to competition for land in areas that can support forests.“
To check which land usage is more efficient, the scientists conducted an array of measurements in the south of Israel, which they said is highly representative of drylands. “Drylands represent a large proportion of the Earth’s land surface, of which nearly half is semiarid and has attracted attention for potential afforestation projects. However, they also can potentially host a significant proportion of utility-scale PV fields,” the group explained as its focus.
Findings
As for the PV effect on the surface temperature, the academics have conducted their research on a PV field in a hyperarid region in the Arava Valley in Israel, next to kibbutz Ketura. That field has an area of 75,600 m2 and an installed capacity of 4.9 MW. That was compared to background measurements from the same area.
According to their measurements, the sensible heat at the PV plant was 359 W m-2. In comparison, in the surrounding background, it was 199 W m-2. Albedo levels were 0.2 and 0.37, respectively. However, according to the calculations, the PV plant would suppress carbon emissions of 14.9 kg m2 per year.
As for the effect of the afforestation of heat levels, the scientist made their measurements at the Yatir forest, the northern edge of the Negev desert in Israel. It is located in a 2,800-ha afforestation of mainly Jerusalem pine trees. That data from there was then compared to data collected from the background desert.
In this case, the measurements showed that the sensible heat at the afforestation area was 522 W m2, while in the background, it was 225 W m2. Albedo levels in the afforestation area were 0.12 and in the desert 0.27. According to the calculations, carbon sequestration was at a rate of 0.15 kg m2 per year due to photosynthesis.
“Results show that in drylands, PV fields are over 50 times more efficient than afforestation,” the researchers said, adding that PV fields reach break-even after around 1.4-3.6 years in drylands, while afforestation takes 94–175 years to do so.
Temperate and tropical climates
Furthermore, using their method, researchers then looked to calculate the break-even time of PV and afforestation in other climates, namely temperate and tropical. Data for those were based on previous studies conducted in Germany and Panama, respectively. The results were shown in “Photovoltaic fields largely outperform afforestation efficiency in global climate change mitigation strategies,” published at PNAS Nexus.
“While the relative efficiency of afforestation compared with PV fields significantly increases in more mesic climates, PV field BET is still around 20 times faster than in afforestation,” they added, noting that, in both tropical and temperate climates, PV fields will take less than a year, while in the case of temperate afforestation, it will take 18.5 years, and in tropical afforestation it will take 15.4 years.
“PV electricity generation can prevent much higher carbon emissions than the amount that afforestation can sequester,” they concluded. “However, the active removal of past emitted carbon and the possible long-term storage as biomass and soil organic matter provides an important advantage for afforestation. Forests provide many other ecological benefits compared with this pure climatic perspective.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/23/workforce-dilemma-casts-long-shadow/,"EMPLOYMENT,OPINION & ANALYSIS,EUROPE",,"NOVEMBER 23, 2023",Workforce dilemma casts long shadow,"From pv magazine 11/23
Solar is everywhere. From large, ground-mounted, utility-scale sites to residential rooftops, growth across the industry shows no signs of slowing. In Europe alone, installed generation capacity is expected to double in the next five years. The dream could become a nightmare, however, if a lack of qualified labor is left unaddressed.
In 2022, the solar sector employed 648,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers in the European Union. The vast majority of them were involved in solar provision, according to trade association SolarPower Europe’s “EU Solar Jobs Report 2023.” Of the current PV workforce, 84% is engaged in the deployment of solar farms while the remaining 16% is divided between manufacturing, operations and maintenance, decommissioning, and recycling.
Europe’s solar workforce is expected to reach 1.2 million FTEs by 2027. This implies that the industry, especially developers, will need to recruit approximately 470,000 new workers, primarily focused on deploying solar farms, as well as the rooftop sector. The anticipated split between rooftops and ground-mounted installations is expected to be 60% and 40%, respectively.
Everoze has seen the impact of labor shortages firsthand while conducting corporate due diligence for investment transactions. Developers often require substantial hiring to meet internal targets and keep projects viable. Addressing workforce challenges is crucial for the growth of companies and the industry.
A shortage of qualified labor is also affecting quality control. Despite the relative maturity of a market now 15 to 20 years old, scarcity of labor leads to mistakes like the kind seen in the early 2010s. This leads to a renewed need for independent advisors to scrutinize projects. The main risk of an insufficiently skilled workforce is projects being developed, designed, built, and operated below industry standards – projects that fail to achieve intended performance, encountering delays and additional costs in the process.
From development to design, construction, commissioning, or operation, the same story is told repeatedly. How many people do you need to deploy a ground mounted solar farm? For a 10 MWp site, a rough estimate might read: one or two developers to handle permitting, two to four design engineers, one or two electrical engineers, and a team of construction workers. Bottlenecks appear when specialists are required, such as grid connection specialists, particularly as grid access requirements evolve and there are growing constraint risks in many jurisdictions. Having an in-house workforce dedicated to this is crucial. Still, it’s hard to find skilled individuals in this field and labor scarcity is expected to persist.
Some companies are forced to use external engineers on their projects. For instance, Skyray, a subsidiary of Everoze, specializes in design and owner engineering works. Unfortunately, Skyray also faces recruitment challenges when hiring the qualified staff necessary to meet client demands. Using external talent is a good temporary solution for tackling bottlenecks but it does not solve the problem in the long run.
New engineers could help to address the issue but the forecast doesn’t look good. The prevailing trend over the past few years has been a decrease in the proportion of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics students in Europe, narrowing the pool of future candidates. With the solar energy sector relatively young compared to other segments of the energy industry, recruiting skilled, experienced specialists to lead departments, manage teams, and provide training can be like finding a needle in a haystack. Salaries are soaring as a result, leaving many companies reluctant to hire.
Businesses grappling with these challenges have adopted various approaches to address them. Major players are offering highly competitive salary packages, including shares, bonuses, and participation incentives in a bid to retain talent and secure their market share. This approach is creating a market bubble, however, that may not foster a fair and sustainable employment environment.
Other companies are placing their bets on young talent by hiring individuals early in their careers – even without relevant experience – and investing time in training and instilling company culture. It’s not an approach without risk, as trained employees may leave if they receive a better offer from a competitor.
Alternatively, some companies are exploring the potential of recruiting experienced professionals from other industries, such as telecommunications, real estate, oil and gas, and the agricultural sector. The hope is these workers will leverage their knowledge and apply it to the solar industry. You can expect this kind of colleague to bring experience in, for example, project development or management but they will still need to adapt to their new industry.
So, what’s the solution? It will not come from individual players or large corporations. Public authorities must act, taking action to orientate young people or retrain skilled workers from other industries. This is essential to tackling the climate crisis. The solar industry holds a promising future despite today’s recruitment challenges. This presents new risks and numerous opportunities. Ensuring steady growth should not jeopardize the high quality standards required from conception to operation. That’s something that we recognize at Everoze, and we’re hiring, too.

“We have reached the point where it is unfortunately not possible to make the production of high-purity silicon in Norway viable,” REC's CEO, Jan Enno Bicker, said in a press release distributed among Norwegian media.
“We compete with Chinese companies that have an electricity price of NOK 0.40 ($0.037) per kWh. Right now, we are paying more than ten times that sum in the spot market.”
The company has not responded to pv magazine‘s request for additional comment.
REC reportedly restarted production at its facilities in Norway in March, but it then shut it down again in August, citing high electricity prices.
According to Norwegian TV channel NRK, REC's activities in Norway have accumulated losses in the amount of NOK335 million ($31.2 million). The closing of the production is expected to affect around 250 workers.
Norwegian solar producers Norwegian Crystals and Norsun also recently announced they halted their wafer operations, with the former filing for insolvency in late August. Meanwhile, Norsun announced plans to open a 5 GW factory in the United States.

What does life-after-PERC look like? High-efficiency n-type technologies have surged into the mainstream with TOPCon clearly the front runner. But HJT and xBC technologies are also being advanced and bringing unique value to the market. In the current oversupply market, how will high-efficiency technologies compete, and what is the pathway for future cost reductions? Furthermore, can these next-generation technologies overcome material supply challenges?
Buckley also noted the likely new climate accord by Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden, might see a formal call for a tripling of renewables capacity globally by 2030.
“At a time of massive capital investment cost blowouts, to be able to invest in deflationary solar is a massive global boon that will provide cost of living pressure relief as well as improved energy security,” he said.
Overcapacity issues
Buckley said price pressure will increase due to the staggering capacity increases announced by the PV industry at the global level, although he questioned a recent forecast by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its recent World Energy Outlook 2023, which claimed thaT the world's cumulative installed solar capacity could reach 2 TW by 2025.
“I find the IEA assumption that the Chinese will run their brand new factories just 35% of the time as ludicrous,” he added. “As this new capacity is brought online for a full year, I would expect the IEA figures to be undercooked by over 50% in terms of global annual solar installs.”
Buckley estimates that solar module prices will end up dropping by 40% this year.
“This will give many investors in the US, India, EU and China good reasons to pause or rethink their financial assumptions that underpinned their announcements of massive capacity expansions,” he said. “Against this, both the US and India have 40% solar module import duties against Chinese products, so they are largely insulated from excessive price competition, and share the cost savings of the 70% decline in polysilicon price over the last year as well.”
Rapid deflation and excessive price pressures, on the other hand, may soon lead to the closure of old technology, sub-scale solar manufacturing facilities, both in China and globally.
“Old facilities simply can’t compete with the scale advantages nor the new technology investments of the world leading firms in this sector, almost all of which are Chinese,” said Buckley.
New cycle
Describing this new industry cycle for the solar PV technology, Buckley said it is different from previous ones, as solar is now the cheapest electricity, which is disrupting incumbent industry competitors.” This means finance will rapidly flee from investing in any new thermal power capacity in the electricity sector globally,” he said.
The analyst is convinced that finance won’t just flee for environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues or moralistic or climate reasons, but it will flee nonetheless because it will not provide new financing to inevitably stranded assets, particularly with the concurrent rapid scaling up of battery energy storage and EVs.
“This time is different because of the convergence of power-industry-transport markets,” Buckley said.
Tim Buckley is the main author of “Solar pivot: A massive global solar boom is disrupting energy markets and speeding the transition,” which was published by CEF in June. There, Buckley and his colleagues said they estimated solar electricity costs to drop 10% annually for the rest of this decade, halving by 2030. The report also provides detailed information on the operating and planned capacity of the global PV supply chain.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/23/new-design-for-kesterite-kesterite-tandem-solar-cells-promises-24-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 23, 2023",New design for kesterite-kesterite tandem solar cells promises 24% efficiency,"Scientists from the Dalian University of Technology in China have designed a tandem solar cell based on two PV devices both relying on kesterite (CZTSSe).
“Through our simulation, we improved the performance of the two cells by adjusting band alignment at interfaces, selecting proper buffer layers, and adding a double layer to both subcells,” the research's corresponding author, Bita Farhadi, told pv magazine.
In the study “Numerical modeling and performance analysis of a novel Cd-free all-Kesterite tandem solar cell using SCAPS-1D,” published in Next Materials, the research group said it used the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, developed by the University of Ghent, to simulate the novel cell configuration.
The researchers designed the upper cell with an aluminum (Al) layer, a buffer layer made of tin, manganese, and oxigen (SnMnO2), a kesterite absorber, a double layer of copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS), and the nickel (Ni) metal contact. The lower cell was designed with an Al layer, an ultrathin aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) film, a window layer of zinc oxide (i-ZnO), two layers of kesterite, and a Ni metal contact.
“The Mn-doped SnMnO2 is a suitable material for the window layer in thin film solar cells since it is affordable and environmentally benign,” the scientists said, noting this compound is replacing commonly utilized cadmium sulfide (CdS). “The modified solar cell performs better in terms of both short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage. These increments are not due to proper tuning of parameters but also to the correct collection of buffer and window layer with suitable band offset at the buffer/window interface.”
The group achieved the current matching between the subcells by adjusting the thickness of the CZTS absorber layer in the upper device. Furthermore, it introduced a second kesterite absorber layer in the lower device to mininimze the conduction band offset (CBO) and increase its open-circuit voltage.
Through the simulation, the academics found that the ideal thickness of the absorber in the upper subcell is 143.3 µm, while for the lower subcell they calculated a thickness of 1.5 µm. These sizes would result in an identical current density value of 20.29 mA/cm2.
The champion tandem device designed via the simulation achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.96%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.637 V, a short-circuit current of 20.29 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 72.05%.
The upper cell was found to achieve an efficiency of 14.05%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.0 V, a short-circuit current of 20.29 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 68.86%. The lower device reached an efficiency of 20.0%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.632 V, a short-circuit current of 20.29 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 81.14%.
“Our tandem design with optimum band alignment at the ZnMnO/CZTS and ZnSe/CZTSe interfaces outperforms the previous design with a CdS/absorber structure and ZnS/absorber,” the academics stated. “These simulation results pave the way for selecting the best material combination and designing highly efficient kesterite single-junction and tandem solar cells.”
Kesterite is one of the most promising light absorber material candidates for potential use in lower-cost thin-film solar cells. Kesterites include common elements such as copper, tin, zinc, and selenium. Unlike CIGS compounds, there are no supply bottlenecks expected in the future.
However, kesterite is still less efficient than CIGS in mass production. The world record for such cells is 12.6%, achieved for large-area devices by Japanese thin-film producer Solar Frontier in 2013.

The Australian federal government has announced a major revamp of the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) as it seeks to accelerate the development of renewable power generation and storage capacity needed to raise the share of renewables in the national energy mix to 82% by 2030.
The initial aim of the CIS, signed off by the Commonwealth, and all state and territory governments in December 2022, was to drive investment in 6 GW of “dispatchable” clean power projects. That ambition will now be lifted to 9 GW of storage capacity and 23 GW of variable renewable generation, for a total of 32 GW nationally.
“This investment will supercharge available power in the energy grid, delivering the long-term reliable, affordable and low-emissions energy system Australians deserve as our grid changes,” Bowen said in a statement.
The CIS, to be delivered in cooperation with the states and territories, involves the government underwriting new investments in renewable generation and storage through ‘contract for differences’ that are won through a competitive tender.
These contracts include pre-agreed floors and ceilings for revenue earned by any one project. If the revenue is lower than agreed, the federal government pays the shortfalls, guaranteeing projects a baseline income. If revenues exceed the agreed price ceiling, the government will take a share of profits.
Bowen said the scheme seeks to provide certainty for renewable investors which has historically impeded the progress of renewable generation and storage projects.
“We’ve had some very good progress, but we need more progress. We’ve got a massive pipeline of renewable energy investment in Australia. But we want it moving to final investment decision more quickly, and we want it making its way through the planning systems more quickly, and really, what we’re announcing today will see that happen,” he said. “It’s also an indication that we are competing in a world very hungry for capital, hungry for supply chain elements where every country in the world really is on the same journey as us, moving to a very high proportion of renewables, and we’ve got to make sure Australia is as certain and as welcoming an investment environment as we can for renewable energy.”
The expanded CIS will hold auctions at six monthly intervals until 2027, in partnership with those state and territory governments that sign onto renewable energy transition plans. The first of the auctions is expected to be launched in April 2024.
The government said the costs of the CIS contracts will not be disclosed to ensure that the “reverse auctions achieve the best bang for buck for taxpayers.”
“We need to keep bidders with their pencils sharp, we want them competing against everyone else and not knowing what the Commonwealth expects,” Bowen said.
CIS tenders have already been rolled out in South Australia and Victoria, and in New South Wales (NSW) where the results of the first pilot auction were announced this week. The successful projects, three large batteries and three virtual power plants, will deliver more than 1 GW of dispatchable power across the state.
“I think that shows what sort of results we can achieve with a well‑designed, well-calibrated policy like the one we’re announcing today,” Bowen said.
As well as delivering its portion of the underwriting, the federal government said it will negotiate agreements with the states and territories to ensure renewables are rolled out and reliability is enhanced through objective benchmarks, an orderly transition, and potential strategic reserves.
The federal government said 18 GW of the 32 GW capacity offered under the expanded CIS will be subject to these bilateral agreements. Capacity may be re-allocated from any jurisdictions that don’t make agreements to those that do.
Commonwealth underwriting will only support renewable projects but the individual jurisdictions can determine the form of the strategic reserve.

Soltec, a Spain-based solar tracking solution provider, has released a new hail defense algorithm to mitigate damage to solar facilities.
Hailstorms, often unpredictable in nature and destructive to solar panels, pose a challenge to solar infrastructure. In 2021, hail-related losses exceeded $1 billion across the United States.
A pv magazine USA webinar session revealed that hail-risk mitigation is a common problem in “Hail Alley,” a broad region encompassing around six states from the Dakotas to Texas, which often experience five or more days each year of catastrophic hail. Climate change has created patterns of irregularity as extreme weather increasingly crops up in regions bordering hail-prone regions.
Soltec’s research reveals that the risk of module damage due to hail impact is most often due to the direct and perpendicular strike of hailstones to the front glass of the module.
The company introduced its Hail Algorithm, combining prediction and detection to direct the panels to angle at a stowed position, protecting them from direct impacts on the face of the module. Stowed solar panels are angled steeply when a hail event is predicted or detected, leading to lowered risk of damage.

Solar tracker adoption has picked up significantly in Indian PV installations. What are the key growth drivers?
Solar trackers help in optimizing and increasing energy production while reducing costs. Single-axis solar trackers generate up to 20% more energy than projects which use fixed-tilt systems that do not track the sun’s movement depending on site conditions. 
The use of modern technology in photovoltaic modules has made solar trackers indispensable, ensuring optimal energy output regardless of geographic location. Bifacial adoption is encouraging. Due to improved tracker design efficiencies, there is an upward trend for adopting solar trackers combined with bifacial module technology in India.
As per a recent report by Bridge To India, improvements in bifacial technology, falling cost premium over monofacial modules, and growing industry experience are finally leading to large-scale adoption of bifacial modules in India. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) gain for bifacial modules over monofacial modules with fixed-tilt structures and single-axis trackers is estimated at 1% and 6%, respectively. 
Currently, the domestically manufactured module capacity is not enough to meet the demand from solar projects. Solar trackers play a significant role in enhancing the yield by up to 20% and help developers and EPCs narrow the gap.  
How much capacity has Nextracker installed in India? 
Nextracker will have over five gigawatts of smart solar tracker systems deployed in India by the end of 2024, with 80% of the components locally sourced. The combination of Nextracker’s hardware and software solutions benefits customers by accelerating construction and generating more energy in rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. These technologies deliver improved solar project profitability and expand the geographic areas where solar is cost-effective. 
We are rapidly ramping up supply capacity to support the country’s ambitious solar goals of 280 GW by 2030 with ‘Made in India’ trackers. 
Land and changing weather conditions are major constraints for solar in India. Given these challenges, what’s your focus when developing PV trackers for the Indian market?
In India, the choice of solar trackers for PV projects is deeply influenced by the nation’s diverse terrain and unique environmental challenges. Nextracker has tailored specialized solutions for the Indian landscape, addressing critical concerns.
Nextracker’s latest innovation for undulating terrain doubles the capability of the popular NX Horizon XTR terrain-following tracker, which has been proven on dozens of utility-scale projects and in-use since 2019. 
NX Horizon XTR-1.5 significantly reduces and even eliminates earthwork on extreme terrain sites without requiring complex joints or additional components. It can save many tons of steel with shorter piles and thousands of cubic yards of cut and fill, with the benefits of accelerating construction schedules, minimizing environmental impact, and reducing project risk. 
Minimizing disturbance also prevents long-term soil erosion and preserves habitats, an essential factor when it comes to ease of permitting for new projects.
Another innovation Nextracker is bringing to the market expands on the company’s yield optimization and control software TrueCapture with Zonal Diffuse, a new tracking capability that enhances energy generation during rapidly changing irradiance conditions on utility-scale sites. This new technology includes spatial resolution sensing and control algorithms, adjusting trackers to variations in cloud cover across the entire power plant.
Plants equipped with Zonal Diffuse can “chase clouds” for additional gains without compromising tracking performance during clear sky conditions. Zonal Diffuse complements TrueCapture’s terrain-adaptive row-to-row tracking mode and Split Boost, a tracking optimization algorithm for half-cell modules.
What are the key design considerations for installing solar trackers?
Effective solar tracker systems require careful consideration of module types, soil qualities, wind dynamics, and corrosion resistance. Trackers are optimized when they are tailored to the unique module parameters determined by the EPC/developer. Soil stability study informs foundation design while understanding local wind patterns ensures structural integrity. The use of corrosion-resistant materials protects the system from environmental wear, maintaining its durability.
Is tracker compatibility really an issue for PV installations using newer modules? 
Module design is the fundamental driver of tracker design. Nextracker systems are compatible and integrated with every Tier 1 module. We work closely with our partners to optimize the attachment and positioning of their modules into our smart solar tracking systems and collaborate on next-generation technologies in our R&D facilities. 
One of the most exciting recent innovations in PV module technology is the introduction of large-format modules. The big modules offer increased power density and a lower bill of materials at scale. Due to their oversized dimensions and additional weight, these powerful products present mechanical, electrical, and weather-related challenges, requiring specialized mounting configurations and optimization approaches. Every Tier 1 module company has certified Nextracker’s compatibility with their products.
Due to large-size projects, a shift towards robotic cleaning is being seen. Nextracker offers robotic cleaning compatibility. Our independent row architecture enables robots to move to adjacent sections to leverage 2 km or more of cleaning per robot charge.
How do you foresee the growth of the solar tracker market in India?
India’s solar tracker market appears to be extremely promising. The demand for solar energy is quickly increasing, fuelled by India’s ambitious target of generating 280 GW of solar power by 2030. Solar tracker systems are critical in this growth trajectory because they optimize the angle of solar panels, ensuring optimum sunlight exposure and significantly improving energy generation efficiency. This optimization is critical for long-term competitive Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), making solar electricity an economically feasible option.
As India’s energy demand rises, solar energy, aided by enhanced tracker technology, is ideally positioned to supply this demand sustainably. Solar trackers not only increase energy production but also improve grid stability, making them essential in India’s changing energy scenario. 
Furthermore, the worldwide focus on renewable energy corresponds with India’s aim to lower carbon emissions, propelling the solar tracker industry forward. In essence, the combination of ambitious goals, the need for cost-effective solutions, and environmental sensitivity paints a bright future for solar trackers in India, emphasizing their importance in the country’s renewable energy path.

German battery supplier Sax Power has developed a new lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) storage system for residential applications. The company said it launched the product after running tests with more than 1,000 storage systems used by more than 300 customers.
The battery does not require an inverter and can be plugged into a secured household socket. Its capacity is 5.8 kWh and its efficiency rate is 99%, said the manufacturer.
Up to three of the battery packs can be installed in a household. End customers who are exempt from VAT can order the storage systems from German distributors and installers for €4,957 .
The new product includes a smart meter that is placed between the battery and the electricity meter. It communicates with the storage device via a LORA wireless connection or an RS485 cable connection and measures the amount of electricity the household uses in real time. This is how the smart meter regulates the delivery of electricity.
The core component of the storage is the digital control of the battery cells, which converts DC voltage directly into AC voltage, which makes the use of an inverter unnecessary.
The required household AC voltage is achieved by accumulating the cell voltages into a sinusoidal shape. The company said its patented circuit allows the cells to work independently of one another and optimally balance the state of charge within a storage unit or during subsequent expansion. The charge imbalance leads to a shortened lifespan for conventional home storage systems.
Sax Power said its product features cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate cells. In addition, the individual monitoring and switching of the battery cells enables the cells to be completely switched off and separated within 0.0002 seconds.
This mostly eliminates the risk of fire and explosion, the manufacturer said. After switching off, the entire system is below the safety voltage, which eliminates any risk for the installer and the customer during maintenance work.
