“The PPA follows on from the signing of a Concession Agreement in February 2019,” the two companies said in a joint statement. “The 40MWac Khoumagueli Solar project will be the West African country's first grid-connected solar photovoltaic plant and is designed to complement power generation at the nearby 75 MW Garafiri hydroelectric plant.”
The facility will sell power to local utility Electricité de Guinée (EDG) at an undisclosed price.
The project is likely the first phase of an 88 MW PV project announced by the French government in April 2017. The French authorities said at the time that the project was expected to be built in two 44 MW phases and to be developed by Solveo Energy.
Guinea has had very limited development of solar energy to date. According to the latest figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Sub-Saharan country had only 13 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2020.
Guinea currently has an installed power generation capacity of around 566 MW, most of which comes from hydropower, and an overall access to electricity of around 26%.

Andalusia-based start-up Solum, which specializes in the development of smart and sustainable products for smart cities, has installed the first solar pavement in a port area in Valencia as part of a strategy set by Puertos del Estado, the Spanish state-owned company responsible for the management of the country's ports, for the complete decarbonization of port areas by 2030.
“The solar pavement concentrates an installed capacity of over 1 kW in just six square meters of surface and will feed a meteorological station,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. It is expected to generate more than 1.9 MWh annually.
“To our knowledge, there are only two other companies in the world that manufacture solar pavements, but none of them do it based on a conventional module,” said Luis Muñoz, VP of Product & Innovation at Solum. “Most of the companies try to do a specific process with another technology. The problem is that this drives up costs and the efficiency is not that high. We decided to start with a conventional photovoltaic panel and add a series of materials to transform the module into a pavement.” These materials are already used in the photovoltaic industry and were applied to the project through a patented technology, he added.

The Solum solar pavement is claimed to have the same efficiency as a monocrystalline module with dark Tedlar. This material is said to be twice as strong as concrete and the patented engineering applied to the solution is claimed to make it resistant to loads, impacts and scratches. It also does not require special maintenance, even less than a conventional floor due to its hydrophobic properties, according to the manufacturer.
Each panel has dimensions of 50 x 50 cm and 2.5 cm thick. “In addition, it is installed in a single day with only two workers, and does not require public works,” Muñoz said. Another solar pavement recently installed in Barcelona required six days to install.
The Valencia solar pavement is Solum's second project after carrying out their first one in Seville, which is intended to charge electric scooters. The company will soon install two other projects, one in Madrid, the other in the Netherlands.

“The proposed structure was designed and simulated,” research co-author Jaker Hossain told pv magazine. “It is not tested in real PV modules yet, but we are in the midst of making real cells.” He also explained that CdSe and CdTe were already manufactured through a spin coating method and that the research group is now focusing on the solution process for CdSe and Sb2Se3 back surface field (BSF) layers. “And then, we will prepare the practical cell,” he added.
In the paper “Design of a highly efficient CdTe-based dual-heterojunction solar cell with 44% predicted efficiency”, published in Solar Energy, the scientists explained that CdSe is an n-type II-VI semiconductor with a direct bandgap of 1.7 eV that is largely utilized in light-emitting diodes, solar cells and photoelectrochemical cells. Sb2Se3 is described as a p-type inorganic semiconductor with an orthorhombic crystal structure and a direct bandgap in the range of 1.2 to 1.9 eV.
The group investigated, in particular, the impact of the addition of a CdSe BSF layer on the heterojunction cell performance, depending on the layer's different thickness and charge carrier density. For example, they ascertained that the cell open-circuit voltage increased from 0.89 to 1.1 V when the BSF layer thickness raised from 0 to 50 nm and the short-circuit current from 28.5 to 31.5 mA/cm2 when the thickness climbed from 0 to 200 nm. An overall increase of cell efficiency was observed for the CdSe thickness of over 50 nm together with a smaller decrease of the short-circuit current.
For the simulated cell, the research team reported the highest efficiency of 32.6% with a thickness of 100 nm, which also provided an open-circuit voltage of 1.15 V, a short-circuit current of 32.48 mA/cm2 and a fill factor of 88.76%.
By increasing the carrier concentration in the CdSe BSF layer and maintaining a thickness of 50 nm, the scientists were able to increase the conversion efficiency of the simulated cell to 44.14%. For this device, the short-circuit current was 49.23 mA/cm2, the open-circuit voltage 1.05 V and the fill factor 85.71%.
“This investigation on deferent interface defect density suggests that the interface defect density has a massive impact on the performance of the CdTe-based dual heterojunction solar cells,” the paper notes. “The interfacial defects are induced by the structural defects of the two respective materials and diffusion of metal cations through the absorber layer during cell fabrication are the key sources of the interface defect.”
The impact of interface defect, however, can be minimized by the utilization of efficient deposition techniques and a highly attentive concentration of Sb2Se3 during fabrication of the cell, according to the researchers.

The procurement exercise, which drew bids for 98.9 MW of capacity, was once again under-subscribed. The government initially hoped to assign 1.48 GW of new projects.
Wind power was again the leading source, with 259 MW allocated across three sites. The GSE also awarded 32.2 MW of solar capacity across eight locations. These include two PV projects submitted by Enel Green Power Srl — part of Italian utility Enel's Enel Green Power Spa division — to be located in the province of Ferrara, in the region of Emilia-Romagna, with capacities ranging from 4 to 8 MW. Another Enel Green Power affiliate, Enel Green Power Solar Energy S.R., secured two projects with a combined capacity of 4 MW in the Sicilian province of Siracusa.
Also aiming to build a PV plant in Sicily is Sunprime Generation, which secured 3.4 MW for its planned project in the province of Messina with the auction's lowest bid of €0.0685/kWh. All the other bids were slightly higher in value.
In the fourth procurement exercise, finalized in January, the lowest bid came in at €0.06819/kWh and was submitted for a 10 MW solar project. Overall, only 20 MW of solar were allocated.
In the third renewables auction, held in October, the GSE had assigned 95.5 MW of solar capacity across four locations. The lowest bid – submitted for a PV project – was €0.06490/kWh. The big surprise in that tender was the inclusion of an 82.3 MW solar power plant to be built in the Sardinian municipality of Uta, near Cagliari.
The limited success of solar in these exercises is due to tender rules that exclude projects on agricultural land. The Italian government hopes to allocate approximately 4.8 GW of generating capacity in the auction scheme, which includes smaller procurement rounds for projects under 1 MW.
Italy, which has over 21 GW of solar capacity, is planning to install around 50 GW by 2030.

The ruling was issued at the request of the Tax and Chancery Chamber of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the U.K. tax office, which is considering an appeal by the Renesola (UK) business which imports products made by U.S.-headquartered Renesola into the U.K.
The EU applied provisional AD and CVD penalties onto imports of Chinese solar wafers, cells and modules in June 2013 and introduced definitive duties – on cells and modules only – in December of that year, with the levies adopted by the U.K. tax office at a time when Britain was an EU member state. The European Court of Justice, in a ruling issued on Thursday, said the European Commission had confirmed, on December 17, 2013, modules assembled outside China from Chinese-made cells, would come under the scope of the trade measures.
Renesola (UK) pointed to Article 24 of the Community Customs Code of the EU, which states: “Goods whose production involved more than one country shall be deemed to originate in the country where they underwent their last, substantial, economically-justified processing or working, in an undertaking equipped for that purpose, and resulting in the manufacture of a new product or representing an important stage of manufacture.”
Renesola argued the assembly of cells into solar panels should be considered the last important stage of manufacture, rendering its products Indian, and questioned the legality of an implementing regulation introduced in 2013 which specifically stated solar products featuring Chinese cells should be considered Chinese regardless of where they are assembled into modules.
The Tax Chamber of the U.K. dismissed Renesola (UK)'s appeal on November 5, 2018, two months after the AD and CVD duties had expired and almost two-and-a-half years after the U.K. voted to leave the EU.
The subsequent appeal lodged by Renesola (UK), to the nation's Tax and Chancery Chamber, was upheld by the higher tribunal in March last year. The Tax and Chancery Chamber stayed proceedings to refer the matter to the European Court for a ruling on whether the disputed, 2013 implementing regulation – which specified the law relating to solar products – was legal.
The European Court published its ruling, upholding the legality of the implementing regulation on Thursday. European case law has not been binding on U.K. courts since the end of last year, when the transition agreement determining Britain's EU exit period ended, but British courts may have regard to European Court decisions if relevant to the case they are adjudicating.

Spain's Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (Miteco), through the Institute for the Just Transition, has approved the bidding terms of an auction that will grant grid access capacity at the node of Mudejar, which is affected by the closure of the Andorra thermal power plant in Teruel operated by Spanish energy company Endesa, a unit of Italian power utility Enel.
The aim of granting the grid access capacity is to facilitate the deployment of renewable energy and promote the economic and social recovery of the zones of ‘just transition', affected due to plant closures, with particular attention to job creation, business development and the fight against depopulation.
The Just Transition Agreement of Andorra-Mining Regions (Teruel) is the first of its kind, Miteco said. This legal instrument will allow the concession of grid access capacity of up to 1.3 GW by the country's network operator, Red Eléctrica Española (REE).
The award criteria for the Andorran node auction will be replicated in future contests in the so-called just transition areas. In this sense, aspects such as the generation of employment or the implementation of vocational training plans so that the local population can participate, will be analyzed. In addition, the indirect effect on local business or industrial projects will also be considered.
The General Directorate of Energy Policy and Mines received, from the electrical system operator, the calculation of the individualized access capacity of the Mudejar 400 kV node. The analysis carried out by Red Eléctrica Española has taken into account, among other things, criteria associated with the short-circuit power and the static and dynamic stability of the network, resulting in 1.3 GW of allowable capacity for this node.
The regulatory order of the public auction for the concession of access capacity in the Mudejar 400 kV just transition node will be accessible at this link until June 15, 2021.
For its part, Endesa announced in 2018 that it would build 1,300 MW of photovoltaics in Compostilla and Andorra, where it will employ the workers of the closed plants.

The European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) has pored over the recovery and resilience plans submitted by 18 member states as part of the process of claiming a share of the bloc's €673 billion Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) and said only Italy's document specifically mentions the potential of PV manufacturing.
A statement issued by the trade body last night pointed out the plans submitted to the European Commission for consideration by Germany, France, Austria, Belgium and Lithuania – member states which host solar manufacturers – contained no mention of support for those companies.
The May edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
“This could be interpreted as a negative signal for the PV manufacturing market already established in these countries,” said the ESMC. The trade body added, the emphasis given by member states to developing a green hydrogen industry would require even more solar generation capacity, exacerbating the current “import over-dependency” which, according to the lobby group, amounts to a €7.4 billion deficit thanks to the inflow of Asian solar cells and modules.
The Brussels-based organization called for the 18 member states which had already submitted RRF plans to revisit them and devote funding to solar manufacturing and for the countries yet to draw up their funding recovery strategies – Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Romania, and Sweden – to include PV production.
Describing the RRF application process as “the last opportunity to plan for … adequate PV manufacturing support,” the ESMC has said €20 billion of EU funding devoted to revitalizing European solar manufacturing could trigger a market worth €50 billion within five years.
The group praised the authors of Italy's RRF plan, who highlighted the opportunity to support industrial value chains, including PV, to break free of a dependency on Asian imports. The government of Italy has suggested €680 million of its RRF cash could be devoted to the renewables industry supply chain.
Elsewhere, Portugal has suggested €930 million of its EU dole-out could back manufacturing and energy investment, Spain mentioned industrial supply chain support and Poland outlined a €1.1 billion support package for low and zero-carbon economy investment, although all but €214 million would be devoted to e-mobility. None of those three nations specifically cited the solar industry in their recovery plans, according to the ESMC.

German renewable energy company Baywa re has agreed to acquire French wind and solar project developer Enerpole for an undisclosed sum.
Founded in early 2005, Enerpole is based in Carcassonne in the south of France and brings to the German company a portfolio of 600 MW projects, including nearly 300 MW of solar and 300 MW of wind.
“We have been working with BayWa r.e. for years,” said Jean-Paul Boulze, president and founder of Enerpole. “The two companies share a common culture of developing projects with respect for men and women, the environment and the regions. It appeared to us as the most natural buyer to take over the approach initiated by Enerpole, with the confidence of the company's employees.”
With this acquisition, BayWa r.e. is, thus, setting up a seventh French office and strengthening its presence in Occitanie, where the company already employs ten people from its Montpellier office as well as two solar maintenance technicians near Toulouse.
Additional recruitment is planned for 2021, making it possible to double the number of employees of the group in the region in two years. “We have a territorial approach aimed at responding to the challenges of each region,” explained Can Nalbantoglu, president of BayWa r.e. France.
Baywa re currently operates five solar parks, for a total capacity of 45 MW in Occitanie, and has more than 200 MWp under development in this region.
Active in France since 2005, BayWa r.e. has installed and commissioned 315 MW of wind and solar farms and provides technical and commercial management of nearly 600 MW. Its portfolio of projects under development now reaches 2.2 GW (1 GW of wind power and 1.2 GW of solar power) in France.
“The acquisition of Enerpole is consistent with our development strategy in France, one of the group's key markets which represents 20% of its results,” continued Nalbantoglu. Over the past three years, the subsidiary, which employs 130 people, has tripled its workforce and still plans to recruit 30 people in 2021.

Poland reached 3.9 GW of cumulative solar capacity by the end of 2020, up from around 1.3 GW at the end of 2019 and just 486 MW at the end of 2018. The exponential growth recorded last year was mainly due to the growing number of grid-connected solar parks.
Poland may reach its 2030 target of 7.8 GW of solar by the middle of this decade, as outlined in the National Plan for Energy and Climate, according to a new report by the Instytut Energetyki Odnawialnej (IEO).
According to another recent IEO report, developers secured preliminary grid-connection approvals for 4.4 GW of solar capacity last year. The IEO also revealed that the combined capacity of all PV projects that secured preliminary grid permits had reached 10 GW by the end of December.

The Victorian government introduced its new Energy Fairness Bill to parliament to “protect Victorian households and businesses from aggressive and exploitative practices.”
The new legislation will ban door-to-door sales for solar businesses, electricity and gas retailers, deeming the practice “high-pressure sales tactics.” For solar companies, the ban will come into effect on September 1, 2021, while for electricity retailers it will be delayed until the end of the year.
“We’re putting energy companies on notice,” Victoria’s Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change, Lily D’Ambrosio, said.
The state government’s new legislation comes after company Vic Solar was fined $3 million for ‘predatory’ tactics earlier this month. In March, Powershop’s Kogan Energy brand was also fined $300,000 after Victoria’s Essential Services Commission found the energy retailer was offering solar customers more expensive electricity plans than non-solar customers.
The changes are not limited to the state of Victoria either, with the Clean Energy Regulator, a Commonwealth government agency, spending the first half of this year introducing a sweep of new tools, rules and taskforces to oversee them.
The new legislation primarily focuses attention on retailers, rather than solar businesses, with its heftiest measure being a penalty of up to $1 million for energy retailers who arrange the wrongful disconnection of vulnerable customers. This measure, the government said in its statement, is to “protect customers in particular who are on payment plans or who require electricity for life support.”
Victoria’s government is also introducing penalties of up to $1 million for gas and electricity licensees who provide false or misleading information to the Essential Services Commission.
Additionally, the bill bans ‘save’ and ‘win-back’ offers, like short-term discounts which ultimately end up costing customers more in the long run. “This misleading tactic is used by retailers to stifle competition and by banning them, customers will be able to judge the best price in the market – and not just for a limited time,” the Victorian government said.
It went on to say the new legislation is intended to make the energy retailer market fairer and more transparent.

LG Energy Solution said it would replace, at its own cost, lithium-ion battery cells used for certain energy storage products that were manufactured between April 2017 and September 2018. The replacement program comes after overheating incidents were reported.
The company said in a statement that it determined that there were issues in the early production processes for electrodes used in potentially affected batteries. Reports said the batteries were produced at the company’s Nanjing factory in China. The replacement program could cost around $350 million.
New batteries will incorporate manufacturing process improvements. The company said it also will implement remote modifications to reduce the potential for overheating while owners wait for their replacement units. LG Energy Solution also will update its battery diagnostic and control software. And it said that field inspections will also be undertaken to monitor and minimize the potential for further incidents.
The company said it “will continue to take preemptive action to ensure that customer safety remains its highest priority.”
News reports said that Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy set up a joint public-private committee in 2019 to investigate the fires and found that some cells had manufacturing defects such as poor cutting, plate folding, and poor material coating. Last December, LG Energy Solution launched a voluntary recall in the U.S. of “RESU” batteries sold from 2017 to March 2019.
In an April 2019 accident involving one of the company’s utility-scale lithium-ion battery arrays at an Arizona Public Service location, a thermal runaway event in a lithium-ion cell triggered a chain of events that led to an accumulation of gases in the container that housed the batteries. Those gases exploded when first responders opened an access door to investigate reports of smoke coming from the container. Two firefighters were seriously injured in the explosion.
In a report released in late July, the utility and its third-party investigator said that evidence pointed to the failure of a single lithium-ion cell as triggering the events. LG Chem challenged that finding, saying that the utility’s report missed a number of details about the accident. Those details indicated, LG Chem said, that the cell thermal runaway began due to “intense heating” caused by a heat source “such as external electrical arcing” on one of the battery racks.
In March, LG Energy Solution said that it planned to invest more than $4.5 billion over the next four years to expand its battery production capacity in the U.S. by 70 GWh. The expansion would give the company a total production capacity of more than 110 GWh in the U.S. In April, Ultium Cells LLC, a joint venture of LG Energy Solution and General Motors, announced a more than $2.3 billion investment to build a battery cell manufacturing plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to serve a nearby GM production line.

A Canadian company whose past ventures include medical marijuana and women’s health care filed provisional patents with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a technology that it said could boost PV system output by 10% or more and reduce panel heat stress.
Kelowna, British Columbia-based Enertopia Corp said its technology would enable it to create a closed system loop where only solar energy is used to extract lithium from source rock at its Nevada mine.
The technology takes excess heat from solar panels and uses it to heat a brine solution from 122°F (50 degrees Celsius) to 140°F (60 degrees Celsius) during a typical three- to four-hour hour processing cycle.
The company said that as it moved toward creating a low-carbon lithium extraction pilot plant, it realized that inefficiencies associated with PV panels could be used to its advantage. In particular, it found that the PV panels are subject to heat stress as temperatures rise. Manufacturers generally rate PV panels at a temperature of 77F (25 degrees Celsius). But field work in the Nevada desert showed temperatures on the back of solar panels regularly exceeding 140F, potentially damaging the panels and reducing output.
The company said that its provisional patent addresses this heat issue.
According to Enertopia, if a panel is rated to have a temperature coefficient of -0.50% per 1.8°F above 77 °F, then that panel’s output power will fall by half of a percent for every 1.8°F (-16.7 degrees Celsius) the temperature rises above 77 °F. It said that a solar array in the Nevada desert operating 60°F into the heat stress zone would experience a decrease of 15% or more on the solar array output.
The technology is designed to be retrofitted onto existing PV panels. An unnamed third party with a 3 MW solar array has agreed to do real-time comparative testing on their PV sub-arrays. The goal will be to increase PV production while simultaneously removing the heat stress.
In December, Enertopia acquired USPTO patent #6,024,086, “Solar energy collector having oval absorption tubes.” At the time it said it believed the patent could provide a “novel approach to using waste heat from various sources.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/27/australian-study-labels-green-hydrogen-cost-projections-as-too-conservative/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 27, 2021",Australian study labels green hydrogen cost projections as ‘too conservative’,"From pv magazine Australia
A study by Australia's Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) into the competitiveness of renewable hydrogen across 25 Australian industry sectors found it is nearing cost competitiveness for heavy trucking, buses and remote power, with the potential to become commercially viable across other sectors of transportation as early as 2030.
CEFC hydrogen lead Rupert Maloney, speaking at the Australia Hydrogen Conference in Sydney on Wednesday, said he expects the price of hydrogen produced using renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, to be comparable with that of blue hydrogen (fossil-fuel sourced with carbon capture) between 2025 and 2030, but closer to 2030.
Maloney expects the price of green hydrogen to not come into line with that of grey hydrogen (produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas or coal) until 2045. The study indicates the forecast costs for low-carbon hydrogen will not achieve cost parity with natural gas before 2050.
The report says farm gate production cost of green hydrogen is currently forecast at AUD3.88 ($3.0) per kilogram. That is predicted to drop to AUD2.81/kg by 2030, still above the forecast production costs for blue hydrogen (AUD2.80/kg) and grey hydrogen (AUD2.29/kg). It is predicted the price for green hydrogen will decline to AUD2.09/kg towards 2050, undercutting blue (AUD2.80/kg) and grey alternatives (AUD2.29/kg).
Andrew Horvath, chairman of Australian hydrogen research and development company, Star Scientific, was surprised by the projections, telling pv magazine the CEFC numbers are “too conservative”.
“Technology has a momentum, and their numbers don’t account for that,” he said.
Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also taken aback by the CEFC projections, saying his expected cost curve reductions around hydrogen are far more ambitious than the CEFC’s.
Turnbull told the audience at the Australia Hydrogen Conference that green hydrogen is the only hydrogen Australia should be focusing on.
Maloney conceded the CEFC figures are “relatively” conservative but said “we are not a grant-giving entity, we’re investors”.
The Australian Hydrogen Market Study, prepared by global energy analysts Advisian for the CEFC, examines the competitiveness of renewable hydrogen compared with existing energy technologies in Australia.
CEFC chief executive officer Ian Learmonth said large-scale development of green hydrogen will be critical in driving down installation and commissioning costs, similar to the development experienced by Australia’s large-scale renewable energy sector.
“There is enormous excitement around the potential to create green hydrogen to deliver a cleaner and more enduring energy source. As with any new technology, costs will decline over time,” he said.
“The purpose of this analysis is to give industry participants and investors an understanding of the potential economics for the uses of hydrogen in the Australian context, including potential early adopters.
“Our experience in developing the solar and wind sectors shows that prices decline rapidly as a new industry reaches scale and technical proficiency. It is encouraging to see a similar trajectory for the exciting hydrogen sector.”
The study found the key factors effecting the production cost of green hydrogen are the cost of renewable power; electrolyser costs; and intermittency of power supply.
The study anticipates that current electrolyser capital costs of around AUD1.1 million per MW would decline to around AUD500,000 per MW by 2050.
Advisian said there could be further upside to these forward cost curves, with several market commentators and manufacturers forecasting a more aggressive reduction in capital costs over a shorter timeframe.
The continued decline in solar and wind generation costs also shapes as a key to lower hydrogen production costs with the cost declines in large-scale solar developments in Australia providing a comparable model.
Advisian said the competitiveness of hydrogen could be further accelerated as a result of other market factors, including the levelised costs of hydrogen being lower than forecast; oil, gas and coal prices being higher than forecast; and the willingness of energy users to pay a premium for a clean energy alternative as part of their broad emissions commitments.
Maloney said that there is also great potential for Australia to play a part in a globally traded hydrogen market.
“Our high quality and low-cost renewable resources provide a comparative advantage which will be a key driver in achieving competitive hydrogen production costs.
“We have a proud history and strong reputation for exporting energy to the world, including as one of the world’s largest exporters of LNG,” he added. “This same skilled workforce can be used to develop and ultimately export new energy vectors such as green hydrogen.”
Australia’s current hydrogen production is about 650 kilo-tonnes per annum and virtually all of this hydrogen is made using natural gas steam methane reforming (NG SMR) and is immediately consumed by the associated ammonia synthesis (~65%) and crude oil refining (~35%) plant.
