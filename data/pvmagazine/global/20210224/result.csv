Publishing its fourth-quarter results this month, Amsterdam-headquartered Photon said its immediate focus would continue to be its core business in Australia and Hungary and its new ventures into Poland and Romania, but the company was still investigating other global opportunities.
Photon was keen to tout the commissioning of 10 solar projects in Hungary with a total generation capacity of 14 MWp but published results which showed a 34% fall in revenue from the €7.75 million banked in the fourth quarter of a Covid-free 2019, to €5.1 million in the corresponding period of last year.
That widened losses from continuing operations from €2.62 million in October-to-December 2019 to €4.36 million in the final quarter of 2020. The company cited lower sale-of-technology revenue which was only partly mitigated by a rise in revenues from Photon's now-74.7 MWp solar plant portfolio.
The figures were in line with a Covid-driven 6.3% annual fall in full-year revenue to €28.26 million, on the back of a 27.8% fall in technology sales.
Refinancing requirements of a growing Australian operation saw bank borrowings rise as Photon's non-current liabilities rose from the €88 million posted at the end of 2019 to €105 million a year later, although the board stressed that was in line with the debt-driven nature of the project development business.
Photon, which claims to be developing 595 MWp in Australia–14.6 MWp of which is under construction–has an operational portfolio ranging in scale from the 137 kWp Břeclav rooftop installed in Czechia in December 2010 to the 2.35 MWp Komorovice array added in the same month in the same territory.
The company claims a 97 MWp development pipeline in Hungary, 105 MWp of projects under development in Romania and 25 MWp in Poland. Photon also claims to have a 249 MWp operations and maintenance (O&M) fleet comprised of 135 MWp in Czechia, 77 MWp in Hungary–swelled by the new additions to secure a 15.7% rise in overall O&M scale–15 MWp each in Slovakia and Romania, and 4.5 MWp in Australia.

A group of researchers from the Center for Solar Energy Technologies of Fraunhofer Chile has compared costs and prices of utility scale hybrid photovoltaic-concentrated solar thermal (PV-CSP) projects and thermal technologies based on natural gas, concluding that the most competitive configuration in terms of the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) corresponds to a hybrid plant that combines photovoltaic solar energy and concentrating solar power (CSP) with integrated thermal storage.
In a study published in the scientific magazine Energies, the Chilean scientists found the LCOE of four different typologies of hybrid PV-CSP plants is lower than that of natural gas thermal power plants.
Their analysis showed that the best PV-CSP configuration, with 13 hours of storage and with no restrictions for power generation, achieved an LCOE of $53/MWh, while the natural gas technology evaluated, with a plant factor of 85% and a variable cost of fuel of $2/MMBtu has an LCOE of $86/MWh.
“Hybrid solar plants, under certain conditions, are more profitable than their closest competitor for the Chilean grid, and at the same time … they provide significant flexibility and dispatch capacity,” said researcher Aloïs Salmon.
“The CSP technology provides very similar systemic benefits while avoiding significant negative externalities, compared to gas plants, and is more profitable,” said research co-author María Teresa Cerda. “In particular, CSP is very flexible, has no emissions, and is not dependent on external markets for fuel supply. In short, it is a renewable energy that can contribute to reduce the price of the grid and provide a baseload and flexible electricity for Chile.”
Chile is currently hosting a considerable number of CSP projects under development. One of Chile’s major renewable energy projects is the Cerro Dominador solar complex, whose combined CSP and PV capacity is expected to reach 220 MW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/24/new-process-to-assess-quality-of-perovskite-semiconductors/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",RALPH DIERMANN,"FEBRUARY 24, 2021",New process to assess quality of perovskite semiconductors,"From pv magazine Germany
Perovskite solar cells can theoretically achieve a power conversion efficiency of around 30.5%. In order to approach these efficiency levels, however, the optoelectronic quality of perovskite semiconductors must increase.
In principle, materials suitable for photovoltaics should not only absorb light but also emit it again efficiently — a process known as photoluminescence. The associated measurement parameter, called photoluminescence quantum yield, is ideally suited to determine the quality of the perovskite semiconductor.
A group of researchers at Germany's Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), the University of Heidelberg and the Technical University of Dresden developed a new model with which the photoluminescence quantum yield of perovskite layers can be reliably and precisely determined for the first time.
In the paper Revealing the internal luminescence quantum efficiency of perovskite films via accurate quantification of photon recycling, published in Matter, the research team shows how the novel method they developed is able to determine the photoluminescence quantum yield under solar irradiation conditions more precisely than previously assumed.
“It depends on the photon recycling, that is, the proportion of the photons emitted by the perovskite that is reabsorbed within the thin layers and re-emitted again, KIT scientist Paul Fassl explained.
The researchers applied their model to methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3), one of the perovskites with the highest photoluminescence quantum yield. This was previously estimated at around 90%, but the model calculations made by the German academics found this value to actually be around 78%.
According to the scientists, the previous estimates had not adequately taken into account the effect of light scattering, which means that these estimates underestimated the probability that photons — the quanta of light energy — escape from the layer before they are reabsorbed.
“Our results show that the potential for optimizing these materials is significantly higher than previously assumed,” said Ulrich W. Paetzold, head of the Advanced Optics and Materials for Next Generation Photovoltaics group at KIT's Institute of Microstructure Technology (IMT).
The research team provides an open-source application with which the photoluminescence quantum yield of various perovskite materials can be calculated using their model.

Around 1.8 GW of the total capacity was approved in the fourth quarter alone, while in the first three quarters of the year the newly approved capacity was 641, 838, and 1,174 MW, respectively.
“The preliminary grid-connection approvals issued in 2020 have already exceeded the current total installed capacity in photovoltaics,” stated the IEO. According to data from Polish energy agency Agencja Rynku Energii Spółka Akcyjna  (ARE SA), this capacity stood at 3.96 GW at the end of December.
Enea was the power provider that granted the largest amount of approvals with 2.2 GW, followed by Energa with 963 MW, PGE with 775 MW, and Tauron with 480 MW.
The IEO also revealed that the combined capacity of all PV projects that secured preliminary-grid permits had reached 10 GW as of the end of December. The vast majority of these projects are for plants of approximately 1 MW, but most of the capacity — around 3 GW — was secured by 466 projects exceeding the 1 MW threshold. In Poland, these two project typologies are being supported by different tender schemes.
The latest tender for renewable energy projects not exceeding 1 MW in size held by the Polish Energy Regulatory Office (ERO) in December saw PV developers secure all of the offered capacity of around 700 MW, as was the case in the same type of auction held a year earlier. As for the latest procurement exercise for projects over 1 MW, the ERO allocated approximately 1.7 GW of renewable energy power generation capacity, including approximately 900 MW of wind power and 800 MW of PV.
Developers are currently most eager to deploy large PV projects with a capacity of 5 MW to 50 MW, according to the IEO experts. Taking into account the number of preliminary grid permits issued for PV farms and the fact that the latest auctions were largely oversubscribed, “it can be concluded that this year will bring a huge development in the utility-scale segment in Poland”, the research institute stated.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/24/new-italian-pv-industry-body-struggles-to-unleash-utility-scale-pv/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"FEBRUARY 24, 2021",New Italian PV industry body struggles to unleash utility scale PV,"Agrivoltaics could free up an additional 30% of land for ground-mounted PV project applications in Italy, Andrea Cristini, spokesperson of new Italian trade body Alleanza per il fotovoltaico in Italia, told pv magazine.
“Agrivoltaics represent one of the solutions but it cannot be the only solution to the advancement of renewable energies in Italy,” Cristini explained, adding that PV plant operators should pay attention not to hinder agricultural production. Reputation damages might outweigh the benefits of installing new PV plants in areas suitable for agriculture.
Cristini also explained, however, that every year thousands of hectares get abandoned in Italy, adding to the existing agricultural land in disuse. According to him, given the high competition in the current global market, this trend is set to continue in the country.
“Agricultural lands used for ground-mounted photovoltaic installations are very few,” he also said. “To reach the 2030 goals, we should realize at least 20 GW of ground plants and at least 1 GW per year of rooftop installations.” Furthermore, he claimed that it would also be necessary to exploit non-strategic agricultural land, as in recent years Italy has installed much less than the 3 GW of additional PV power needed per year to achieve the targets set by the Italian energy strategy.
Cristini explained that there are no official documents about disused areas to be reused in Italy and that only some regions have defined suitable and unsuitable areas for renewable energy sources. “This mapping, however, does not consider the presence of infrastructure in the territories in which you can or cannot build plants,” he said. “Moreover, it does not take into account the possibility of creating projects that mitigate potential negative factors.”
Cristini mentioned a study conducted by Italy’s Politecnico di Milano, which showed that between 8 and 9 GW of ground-mounted plants can be installed on redeveloped agricultural land. These additional areas, however, would be available only in the medium or long term, and would not provide any help to reach the EU’s 2030 objectives.
“The selection of the right area also depends on existing infrastructure,” argued Cristini. The construction of new infrastructure supporting renewables could impact the landscape even more than the photovoltaic systems themselves. Additional works would also imply additional costs. “The capacity of the network and the existence of infrastructure is of fundamental and strategic importance for those who invest but especially for the territory,” he stated.
Currently, industry experts see the Tuscia and Apulia regions as two potential hubs for utility scale solar plants. Several project developments, however, have been halted due to low acceptance from local communities and regional and central authorities.
“In some areas such as Tuscia and Brindisi, competent authorities have approved the projects but then the Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici–the government department responsible for the environment and historical buildings–has challenged these authorizations by raising an appeal, although the areas in question are free of constraints,” said Cristini, adding that some projects in the Brindisi area have been blocked even before, in the authorization process.
According to Cristini, offshore PV is not a viable option in Italy and cannot represent an alternative to ground-mounted. “Floating platforms on which to install photovoltaic panels are quite difficult, mainly at the authorization level,” he said, suggesting that the more promising areas are inland reservoirs. “Projects of this kind would probably require public funding,” he concluded. “The eventual use of public incentives would be, in our opinion, a waste of resources that could be used for other things, since utility scale plants have the added advantage they do not require public aid.”

The green hydrogen partnership would be set up to work alongside the extensive European Clean Hydrogen Alliance which was established in March, to attain goals in line with the bloc's hydrogen strategy.
A separate partnership would pursue innovation in the “next generation of low-carbon aircraft” including the use of novel power sources and engines.
Nine of the ten proposed partnerships will now go to the European Parliament and its economic and social committee for consultation before being presented to the heads of state who make up the Council of Ministers for adoption. The tenth arrangement, concerned with metrology– the science of measurement to inform regulations and standards–will be informed by the parliament's economic and social committee before being decided upon by the Council of Ministers and parliament.

The experts from the German research institute specified that the lowest LCOE of €0.0713 is for agrivoltaic projects linked to permanent crops with a low clearance height and that this cost is only by a third higher than that of common ground-mounted PV plants in Germany. “The cost estimate does not take into account that economies of scale in agrivoltaic systems with arable farming (and the tendency to larger field sizes) may result in a cost advantage compared to systems coupled with special and permanent crops,” the researchers explained. “This economic advantage should also apply to the fixed costs of the project planning, since grid connection, for example, is a key factor for the total fixed costs and therefore the overall economic viability for small systems.”
The scientists also explained that, if a proper regulatory framework is put in place, small agrivoltaic projects may also be viable when the generated energy or most of it is self-consumed. “At a commercial electricity price of 14 to 16 euro cents per kWh and a levelized cost of electricity of around 9 ct/kWh, for example, savings of 5 to 7 cents per kWh can be realized.”
According to the report, three main measures should be introduced in the German renewable energy legislation to enable the strong development of agrivoltaic projects: the recognition of agrivoltaics to maintain land subsidies for agricultural operations; the privilege for agrivoltaics to make approval processes easier; and the creation of specific tenders.
Horticultural applications are pointed out as the best suited for a market launch of agrivoltaics. “Reasons include the frequent close physical proximity of the growing area to the farmyard, the high synergy potential of the cultivated plants, the lower cost of supports, and the comparatively simple integration into the management methods for permanent crops,” the German researchers stated.
The guidelines describe the advantages and opportunities of agrivoltaics and provide a review of its current development. Practical advice on how to deploy agrivoltaic projects is also given to farmers, municipalities and companies. The guide was created with the support of experts from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), the University of Hohenheim, the Weihenstephan-Triesdorf University of Applied Sciences, German renewable energy company BayWa r.e. and the law firm Becker Büttner Held Rechtsanwälte (BBH).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/24/vehicle-integrated-pv-reduces-ev-charging-time-in-sunny-regions-by-40/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 24, 2021",Vehicle-integrated PV reduces EV charging time in sunny regions by 40%,"Electric cars incorporating PV panels on their bodywork or roof have the potential of reaching more than 10,000 km per year of pure solar-powered driving and the modules could have a payback time of only three or four years.
This is one of the main preliminary findings of a research program for vehicle-integrated PV that is being run by Bonna Newman, program manager for PV and Mobility, Module Technologies at the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). “We have developed a model to quantify all the benefits that are generated by installing solar panels on electric vehicles,” she told pv magazine. “We want to look at how much PV power can really be expected to be generated in different situations.”
The program includes exploring crystalline silicon, thin-film and perovskite technologies. “We are testing different technologies and we are seeking to make them effective for on-board PV generation for all kinds of electric vehicles, including buses and trucks,” she further explained.
The 10,000 km range, however, is still difficult to reach for most electric cars that are currently on the market due to their current vehicle energy efficiency. “But electric car models are improving dramatically,” Newman stated. “The Tesla Model 3, for example, is much more efficient than the previous versions.”
According to Newman's estimations, the benefits of vehicle-integrated PV are proportional to the solar radiation levels of a given area, its demand for electric vehicles, and its power prices. “If we replace the grid electricity with the power generated by the solar panels in a place like the Netherlands, where there is not too much sun, but electricity prices are close €0.20 euro per kWh, we may have as much as between €150 and €200 in direct electricity savings each year,” she emphasized. “If the panels that you put on your car cost approximately €1,000 or €1 per watt, compared to conventional solar, you can consider a three-to-four-year payback time and there is a reasonable benefit here.”
The CO2 savings are estimated at 250 kg per year compared to electric cars relying exclusively on grid electricity. “This is clearly a benefit in terms of the energy transition, but it depends on the location and what kind of grid you have there,” she said. “In a place like France, where most of the grid electricity comes from nuclear power, you can also have zero emissions and, in this case, you don’t have much of a C02 benefit there.”
The estimations also include embedded CO2 in PV panels based on conventional module manufacturing methods. “We found that in almost all situations the CO2 benefits brought by vehicle-integrated PV are more than with electric vehicles only,” Newman added.
Another important factor, which for the Dutch research group is still difficult to quantify, is what it calls the “convenience factor”, which is expressed in terms of solar kilometers and the numbers of times you have to plug your car into the grid. “Through our most detailed model, we assessed a Tesla-like car in the Netherlands, for which average driving reaches around 13,000 kilometers per year,” she stated. “What we found is that you could expect to drive more than 3,000 km on solar and to charge about 25% fewer times when PV panels are installed on the vehicle. And this is annually, but in the summertime, you may even drive for three months without recharging the vehicle  a single time.”
In sunny places like Spain and Italy or countries with similar solar radiation levels, the charging time may be reduced by about 40% annually. “And this may be achieved with today’s PV and EV technologies,” Newmann affirmed. “Even in the event of running out of energy, on a sunny day, the panels would have enough power to partially recharge the vehicle and bring it to the closest recharging station, without the need of external help.”
When asked if module integration is preferable when made by the car manufacturer or an external body, Newman said that, in the long-term, a better design can be achieved if the solar modules are integrated in the car factory. “The most practical and the most cost-effective solution is the PV system integration within the automotive industry, by the car OEM which is responsible for the car roof or parts of the bodywork,” she said. “After-market solutions, however, may currently be a better way to prove and popularize vehicle-integrated PV in a faster way.” Currently, all the vehicle-integrated PV products that are available on the market are done by car manufacturers.
As for the after-market solution, the integration of PV into the vehicle system will be slightly different on each vehicle. Therefore, the system integration will need to be improved or adapted for different vehicles for optimal performance.
For the integration of the panels in the car’s body component, the TNO scientists want to use modules that are as similar as possible to conventional products used in the solar industry. In this way, they can take advantage of a large-scale supply chain, which provides improvements and efficiencies and costs. “We can afford higher costs than conventional PV, but if we stay close to what the PV industry is doing in terms of manufacturing, we can translate that better value for the solar mobility industry,” Newmann emphasized.
The prevailing PV technology in this market segment remains crystalline silicon PV, as it provides the largest yield. “At this time, we need more energy production density than CIGS can typically provide,” Newman specified. “We are working on CIGS in terms of integration because it has obvious advantages for being lightweight and flexible.”
Crystalline silicon, however, has a much better supply chain from a cost perspective, she notes. “It is possible to curve crystalline silicon panels to the shapes that are needed. Most of the areas of the vehicle are flat enough for crystalline silicon and, for this reason, we consider it the most promising technology for the near future.”
Crystalline solar cells are also easier to connect on the roof, at least with the current state-of-the-art technologies. Crystalline silicon also reacts better to dynamic shading events, as shading can cross a vehicle many different times in different ways and in a very unpredictable manner. “In the future, we can hopefully come up with a solution for thin films that can perform better during these events, eventually adding perovskite or CIGS layers,” Newmann explained.
The Dutch research team is also working on reliability and safety issues. Crash and splintering tests are performed to understand what happens in the case of an accident, in which the solar panels on the roof or other surfaces of a car may also be broken.
“For example, the voltages from one corner of the roof to the other corner which people would not be able to touch normally, would not be an issue,” Newmann said. “In an accident, however, these pieces of the roof could be much closer together and then potentially endanger rescue workers and the risk of an electroshock cannot be excluded.” The program is intended to ensure that these panels are at the safety levels of a consumer product.
Another important factor is considering what could happen if a car with solar panels on the front side hit a pedestrian, Newmann added. “We have to see how the glass shatters in the event of a collision with a person’s head, for example. We have to see in which way this impact injures the head of a pedestrian compared to a car without panels and we have to be sure that the solar panels will not increase any risk .”
It is very important to avoid these kinds of issues arising in the early stages of this market segment, she stressed. “Even if the technology has clear benefits, we have to make sure it is introduced in a safe way.”
There are no major hurdles for introducing 21%-efficient panels on the body of an electric car within the next five years and have tens of thousands of cars produced, from a technology perspective. Many people may decide to buy an electric car with integrated PV because of the convenience factor. “By 2030, I could imagine that EVs with solar panels may represent 10% of the EV market,” Newman forecast. “It will be a pretty big market and this percentage is not even that extreme in my mind, if you consider that the payback time is between three and four years.”
Looking forward, Newman said that it would probably be difficult to see electric cars powered exclusively by solar panels. “It will be difficult to get rid of a cable completely,” she concluded. “But there is a good chance that, if you live in a sunny place, you can drive for weeks during summertime without the need for recharging.”

The state-owned company, which currently owns a number of coal mines and coal-fired power plants, is looking to position itself for the inevitable net-zero emissions future. The move follows the State Government’s allocation of $500 million to the Renewable Energy Fund for more publicly-owned clean energy generation.
Specifically, Stanwell is looking to hear from large-scale wind and solar projects, especially those integrated with storage, though it is also “open to hearing from innovative new energy solutions.” It is also open to projects at various stages of development and has not set a total megawatt target.
“We are looking at mature projects which have a capacity of 100 MW in aggregate for the stages and early-stage projects above 50 MW,” a spokesperson for Stanwell told pv magazine Australia.
While in its statement Stanwell says it is “casting the net nationwide,” it goes on to specify it is particularly interested in projects based in Queensland.
The expression of interest process opens from today, and Stanwell says interested developers should register their interest before March 24, 2021.
“The energy market is changing rapidly, and we are evolving our business in line with our customers’ changing needs and community sentiment for greener energy and lower emissions,” Stanwell CEO Richard Van Breda said in a statement.
“Through our expression of interest process, we will build a portfolio of renewable projects that meet our retail customer requirements, support the development of Queensland’s large-scale renewable industry, and enable us to diversify our portfolio and reduce our carbon intensity.”
Community group Solar Citizens has applauded the decision. “For decades Queenslanders have voted to keep the majority of the electricity system in public hands, but so far it has mainly been the private sector that has seized the opportunities to develop and operate new solar, wind and storage plants,” Solar Citizens’ National Director Ellen Roberts said. 
“We’ve just recently seen the state’s coal and gas assets decrease their value by over a whopping $1 billion as more cheap solar and wind energy comes online. It’s likely that they’re heading for early retirement. The state-owned generators need to act fast to diversify their revenue to continue to provide returns for Queenslanders.”
Stanwell’s announcement comes just one day after the Queensland Government declared it will establish a Ministerial Energy Council to work with government to deliver for the future energy needs of the State. Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen Minister Mick de Brenni office released a statement on Tuesday saying it will bring together energy sector leaders, industry bodies, consumer groups and unions and government leaders to transition the state to cleaner energy.
“This decade will herald a significant adjustment in the way energy is produced, distributed and stored,” Minister de Brenni said. “Making it vital that we collaborate, so that Queenslanders can continue to receive stable, reliable, low-cost energy generation and supply.”

The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) has officially kicked off a massive call for new renewable energy and storage over the next three years.
On Feb. 22, the utility issued a request for proposals (RFP) seeking to procure 1 GW of renewable energy resource capacity. The RFP also calls for 500 MW/2 GWh of energy storage capacity with an effective duration of four hours, including 150 MW to be provided by virtual power plants made up of distributed generation, storage, and demand response resources.
This RFP represents the first of six tranches soliciting proposals for a cumulative total of 3.75 GW of renewable generation and 1.5 GW of energy storage during a three-year period. The procurements are in accordance with the Integrated Resource Plan approved by the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau on Aug. 24, 2020, and additional orders issued by the bureau.
The island’s grid has been undergoing a transition ever since it was devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017. Puerto Rican leaders and regulators pushed to rebuild the power infrastructure with a stronger reliance on renewable energy.
Under Act 17, which was signed into law in 2019, PREPA is required to obtain 20% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2022, 40% by 2025, 60% by 2040, and 100% by 2050.
Proposals for PREPA’s initial RFP are due May 3. The full document is available here.
