The Spanish government has announced a funding scheme for hybrid energy storage projects that generate electricity from renewable sources. The scheme is part of its Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan (RRTP).
The scheme will finance five storage projects with a cumulative installed capacity of at least 600 MW, or equivalent total energy supply. The projects must be hybridized with renewables, but the funds will only cover the addition of storage.
The maximum funding available per project and per developer is €15 million. The amount of aid for each installation will be determined according to total project costs and the size of the developers. The same project can be financed both by the Spanish government’s incentive scheme and other programs from the European Union, as long as the funds aren’t used to cover the same costs.
The government will only provide subsidies to projects that wouldn’t be financially viable without state support. Projects under development before applying for funding will not be eligible. Projects do not require grid connection permits to qualify for financing, as developers can obtain permits during the execution phase. Advance payment of up to 80% of the total funds may be requested to facilitate project financing.
Commenting on the initiative, Luis Marquina, president of Spain's storage association Aepibal, told pv magazine that it “is a step forward, indisputable and necessary, but which also raises many questions.” He hopes these questions will be answered in future consultations with the government, noting that clarification on what counts as an innovative storage project and the start date of a hybrid project are needed.
The call for proposals will be centralized by the Spanish Institute for the Diversification and Saving of Energy, which will grant the funds on a competitive basis. Eligible projects have until the end of December to apply. The scheme will last until Dec. 31, 2025.

Resource-sector heavyweight Rio Tinto has unveiled the latest steps in its plan to power its Western Australian operations with renewable energy. The multinational miner said it will fund the construction of two 100 MW solar farms, as well as 200 MWh of on-grid battery storage in the Pilbara by 2026.
Work on the first of the standalone 100 MW solar farms, which will require the installation of about 225,000 solar panels, is expected to commence in 2023, with Rio Tinto anticipating the project will be finished and in the commissioning phase by 2025. The second of the solar farms is due to come online a year later.
Initial funding for the first of the PV projects and associated transmission infrastructure has already been ticked off, with final capital approval expected in the second quarter of 2023. The miner said it has also commenced talks with the Western Australian government and traditional owners about securing the relevant approvals and required land on the Pilbara coast for the projects.
The new solar and storage is in addition to the 34 MW of PV already installed at Rio Tinto’s recently commissioned Gudai-Darri iron ore mine. The addition forms part of the mining giant’s previously announced plan to develop a 1 GW solar and wind power operation in the Pilbara as part of a global commitment to invest approximately $7.5 billion to halve emissions by the end of the decade.

The company said this will include significant investment in transmission infrastructure to support full decarbonization of the Pilbara, including electrification of the miner’s mobile and rail equipment beyond 2030, which is estimated to require up to 3 GW of installed renewable energy assets.
“The Pilbara is extremely well-positioned to take advantage of renewable power with land, access to people, and abundant wind and solar resources,” said Rio Tinto Iron Ore Chief Executive Simon Trott. “We expect to invest around $3 billion to install renewable energy assets as well as transmission and storage upgrades in the Pilbara as part of our commitment to halve our emissions from the Pilbara by the end of this decade.”
The new projects combined are expected to abate around 300,000 tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to a 10% reduction in total Scope 1 and 2 emissions from Rio Tinto’s iron ore business in the Pilbara, based on 2021 levels.
Rio Tinto expects the projects to reduce its gas consumption in the Pilbara by about 30%.

“We investigated, in particular, the relationship between cumulative surface evaporation and evaporation time using simple linear regression and SPSS Statistics, a statistical software suite developed by IBM for data management,” researcher Wen Liu told pv magazine.
The scientists placed evaporation containers and pans under two different kinds of arrays deployed on air-dried loamy soil in Fuyang, in China's Anhui province. The region has a warm, temperate, semi-humid monsoon climate.
The first array was a classic agrivoltaic system based on crystalline silicon solar panels. The scientists referred to it as the “Even-lighting Agrivoltaic System” (EAS). It features grooved glass plates between two conventional PV panels to facilitate the even transmission of sunlight with uniform illumination, in order to provide enough light intensity for plant photosynthesis.
The second array was a system based on bent glass panels covered by low-cost multilayer interference films to enable sunlight separation, which they referred to as a “Concentrated-lighting Agrivoltaic System” (CAS). It uses spectral separation, which selectively transmits red, blue, and far-red light from sunlight to plants for photosynthesis. The rest of the sunlight is then concentrated and reflected onto PV panels for electricity generation.
“Whether CAS or EAS, the soil and water surfaces under the systems are exposed indirectly by the sunlight,” said the researchers. “The soil moisture content is higher than any soil surface exposed directly by the sunlight.”
The academics said that their findings provided “strong evidence” of reduced water evaporation at both facilities.
“The cumulative soil surface evaporation during the experiment period in the bare soil, under the CAS, and the EAS were 80.53 mm, 63.38 mm, and 54.14 mm; thus, CAS and EAS significantly reduced water evaporation at 21 % and 33 % of the soil surface evaporation,” they said. “The cumulative evaporation of the pan surface during the experiment period in the bare soil, under the CAS, and the EAS were 278.76 mm, 238.52 mm, and 225.85 mm; thus, the CAS and EAS significantly reduced water evaporation at 14 % and 19 % of the pan surface evaporation.”
They presented their results in “Water evaporation reduction by the agrivoltaic systems development,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.
“The correlation coefficient in all treatments was more than 0.91, suggesting a robust linear relationship,” the scientists concluded.

“Our work provides an improved description of the behavior of PV modules at different irradiance levels and describes some aspects that were not fully present in the scientific literature,” researcher Fabiano Gasparin told pv magazine. “The results can be applied to any type of PV system with crystalline silicon cells.”
The scientists said that they wanted to identify a general relationship between the dependence of TCs and irradiance based on experimental data, which could be used for PV module performance modeling, they claim.
The researchers assessed the TCs of eight PV modules with different efficiencies at different irradiances. They measured the I-V curves of the panels in a large area pulsed solar simulator (LAPSS) with irradiance from 100 to 1,000 W/m2 and temperatures from 25 C to 65 C.
“From a matrix of 50 I-V curves for each module, the TCs of open-circuit voltage (VoC), short-circuit current (IsC), and maximum power (Pm) were calculated for different irradiances,” said Gasparin.
The scientists tested the modules in a thermostatic chamber that heated them to a controlled temperature. They found that the TC of VoC varies logarithmically with irradiance for c-Si PV modules.
“This behavior was well described by a new empirical logarithmic function derived from measured data,” said Gasparin. “This behavior was also described by theoretical equations derived from the physical principles of a solar cell model, and both models are equivalent.”
They determined that the TC of IsC is practically constant with irradiance for conventional c-Si PV modules and increases slightly at lower irradiances for modern half-cell PV modules.
“This behavior was not investigated further because it plays only a minor role in modeling the energy conversion of PV modules,” they said. “The TC of Pm, by contrast, is fairly constant with irradiance for the half-cell PV modules studied.”
Gasparin said the group has yet to simulate its findings in the modeling of systems.
“We do not yet know how the actual impact on system power generation over time will compare to the simulated results,” he said. “A new development for the future would be to compare the models and evaluate the impacts. New simulations can show us the differences, but from the perspective of investors and developers, they seem secondary. Perhaps a small improvement in simulated results can be achieved.”
The researchers introduced their novel methodology in “Assessment on the variation of temperature coefficients of photovoltaic modules with solar irradiance,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.
“The results can improve the PV accuracy of PV device modeling in a wide range of solar irradiance and temperature, including an effect not usually considered in engineering applications,” the scientists concluded.

“This [memorandum of understanding] is the first step toward that, with the next steps yet to be foreseen and defined,” an EDPR Sunseap spokesperson told pv magazine.
PlasticBean produces 100% recycled plastic pellets that can be used to make floaters for future PV projects. Its Bluewave thermoplastic material is derived from marine plastics, ocean-bound plastics, post-consumer waste, and post-industrial waste. These plastics are collected at riverbanks and coastal areas in some of the most polluted parts of the world, according to a joint statement by EDPR Sunseap and PlasticBean.
The companies said the cost of the recycled material will be similar to or lower than plastic made from virgin materials such as crude oil. This has convinced them that floating solar PV projects using fully recycled floaters could be a bankable investment, said the EDPR Sunseap spokesperson.
“EDPR Sunseap is always on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate with innovative partners to help keep our planet clean for the next generation,” said EDPR Sunseap CEO Frank Phuan. “By working with PlasticBean, we can bring the world a step closer towards a circular economy where plastic waste is recovered and recycled rather than thrown away.”
EDP Renewables has previously used sustainable materials in its floating solar projects. For example, it used floaters made of corkscrew composite and recycled polymers in a hydropower dam installation in Alqueva, Portugal, said the spokesperson.

The COP27 climate change summit in Sharm El Sheikh in November failed to achieve progress on multilateral decarbonization, with several of the world’s fastest-growing economies arguing they should be treated as developing countries because of their lower contribution to historical emissions. Regardless of the merits of that argument, India and China are leading the world with their coherent approach to utility-scale solar and other renewable energy sources.
Getting connected
The transition from fossil-fueled power to renewables is not a simple swap from one type of generation to another. Coal, gas, and oil – as well as nuclear – power stations are large static plants, connected to feed power outwards through a passive transmission and distribution network. Solar and wind plants are smaller resources, typically more widely distributed.
Wiki-Solar
We know substantial changes to transmission grids are needed to accommodate a high penetration of renewables. Developed countries – particularly in Europe and Australia – have appeared blind to the changes required, or at least resistant to making them. The deployment of utility-scale solar in those regions has been depressed in recent years by a lack of connection capacity in the right locations.
India and China, by contrast, have invested substantially in transmission infrastructure to support new utility-scale solar and wind capacity. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, when he was chief minister of Gujarat, inaugurated the first multi-plant solar park at Charanka 10 years ago. In a pioneering approach that has now been replicated in dozens of similar solar parks around India – large sites where multiple solar projects are co-located by one agency – Gujarat provided a high-capacity grid connection to which all the plants could connect.
This approach has now evolved to include transmission infrastructure across larger distances. Five solar parks and clusters – the latter instances of multiple nearby projects without central organization – around the Thar desert in Rajasthan house nearly 20 GW of solar capacity, feeding power through India’s Inter-State Transmission System to states as far away as Maharashtra. Rajasthan overtook California this year to become the world’s top state or province for cumulative utility-scale solar capacity.
China, likewise, has installed extensive transmission capacity to evacuate power from huge solar power stations in its arid western and northern regions to the populous cities on its eastern seaboard. The 5 GW cluster in Qinghai’s Gonghe County connects to a transmission line almost 2,000 km long, all the way to Beijing. The Tengger Solar Park, in Ningxia, is now being expanded by a further 3 GW and new gigawatt-scale projects are in development in Sichuan.
Catching up
Overall, developed countries are losing market share in utility-scale solar.
The brightest spot is the United States, but even here the regional situation is patchy, depending on how states embrace solar. The Pacific Southwest, which used to dominate US solar capacity, is losing ground, while formerly “solar-skeptic” states including Texas and Florida are now catching up. North Carolina has always been an enthusiast and is still the fourth biggest state for utility-scale solar capacity – ahead of sunnier Nevada and Arizona. Canada has done little since the end of Ontario’s solar initiative in the last decade.
Europe, which was the leading market for big solar capacity until 2013, has been losing ground ever since. Many formerly leading countries have suffered from a lack of grid connections. Only Spain is adding significantly to its installed capacity. Germany and France are making only cautious advances, the United Kingdom has no coherent renewables strategy beyond offshore wind, and progress remains at a snail’s pace in Italy.
Australia too has suffered from connection problems, though it is steadily rising up the international league table. South America is catching up, with a large pipeline of projects in development. However, these tend to take a long time to mature, so South American policymakers and developers could perhaps learn from the holistic approach adopted in China and India.
Emission reductions
Utility-scale solar must be a major contributor to reducing emissions if the 1.5 C maximum global temperature rise target is to be met and the contribution this segment of the solar market can make is already evident.
Image: Wiki-Solar
The table above estimates emissions, in million metric tons (MT), that the top big-solar countries are avoiding as a result of their operating PV capacity. It uses national averages for the annual output per megawatt of generation capacity and for the carbon emissions per megawatt-hour produced, so it is subject to a margin of error. Nonetheless, the figures show most countries are mitigating a few percent of their emissions through the electricity delivered by large solar plants.
Chile comes out on top, thanks to an ambitious renewables program and high levels of solar radiation. Spain, India, Vietnam, and Australia also rank highly, for similar reasons. The rest of Europe, Japan, and Canada could all do better.
Overall, with utility-scale solar deployment continuing to accelerate year on year, the segment can be expected to make a valuable and growing contribution to climate change mitigation.

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is expected to vote on the Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 proposal in mid-December. It could change the structure of net metering and lower export rates by as much as 76%.
Net metering is a process under which utilities pay rooftop solar owners to export electricity back to the grid. The solar array produces extra electricity during the day and in sunnier times of the year, so that a credit carries on the utility bill to cover the times when solar production is not covering electricity usage. Net metering helps rooftop solar owners get a return on their investment, and the excess energy sent by the system helps utilities balance the grid and meet demand.
Currently, average net-metering rates range from $0.23/kWh to $0.35/kWh, and the new proposed decision cuts those rates to an average of $0.05/kWh to $0.08/kWh. This is set to be the largest drop in export rates in US history.
Current NEM 1.0 and 2.0 customers are grandfathered into their rates for 20 years, as are those who receive grid-interconnection approval from the utility before 3.0 is enacted, should it go through in the vote. If enacted, the final date by which interconnection approval would be needed to attain NEM 2.0 rates would be April 15, 2023.
“If passed as is, the CPUC’s proposal would protect utility monopolies and boost their profits, while making solar less affordable and delaying the goal of 100 percent clean energy,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA).
There are several case studies across the nation that have shown solar adoption falls sharply following such a regulatory decision. In California, the Imperial Irrigation District abandoned net metering in July 2016, causing residential solar installations to decline by 88%. Also in 2016, Nevada made a cut to net-metering compensation resulted in a 47% reduction in residential solar installations over the next year, said CALSSA. This led to a 2017 legislative session that restored net metering, which drove an increase in solar adoption.
The next print edition of pv magazine – due out on Tuesday – will visit Ukraine to examine the extent of damage caused to the nation’s energy infrastructure, including its solar plants, and we will include coverage of how PV has been affected in the newly-liberated region of Kherson.
“At a time when California needs rooftop solar to flourish, it’s risky to cut a key incentive without having a viable alternative in place. California’s decision-makers need to make rooftop solar as affordable and accessible as possible so that every household with solar potential can realistically make the choice to go solar,” said Laura Deehan, state director of Environment California.
The CPUC found that California must triple the amount of local, distributed solar to reach the clean energy mandate laid out by the state’s Senate Bill 100. CALSSA said rooftop solar will save California ratepayers $120 billion by 2050, or $300 per person per year.
Abigal Ross Hopper, the president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said that the decision should be altered to “ensure a more gradual transition to net billing.”
