That eye-watering figure for 2020–based on unaudited figures–compares with a net profit of RMB110 million ($16.9 million) for 2019 but the comparison is deceptive, the GCL board explained, as the 2019 figures included a RMB4.4 billion uplift from the sale of a 31.5% stake in GCL New Energy Technologies Co Ltd.
Factor in the statement the latest heavy loss comes despite currency gains on dollar-denominated debts–thanks to the dollar's depreciation against the renminbi–and the picture painted is of a grim year indeed for GCL.
That is in large part down to hefty impairments at a GCL New Energy solar project business forced to sell off 2.7 GW of the 7.7 GW portfolio it held at the start of last year, to pay down debts–a sale process which failed to avoid the company suffering a recent cross default.
The scale of impairments at a project operation which expects to announce a net loss of at least RMB900 million ($138 million) in a fortnight's time includes no less than RMB500 million for lost income from electricity revenue and another, non-cash hit of at least RMB300 million associated with long awaited payments which are still outstanding. The development side of GCL posted a RMB605 million net profit in 2019.
On that last point, at least, GCL New Energy said: “The board is currently reviewing its options to recover these receivables and shall take all appropriate measures to protect the rights and interests of the company and the shareholders. The management of the company is still confident that the company can recover these receivables by taking the relevant appropriate actions in the foreseeable near future.”

Protesting farmers have formed human chains in the project area and claim farmland producing three crops a year was selected for the solar site instead of a barren field. The protesters say 5,000 farmers will lose their livelihoods if the Sonagazi Solar Power Ltd project is constructed on 207 acres of farmland.
The controversial project is being established by state body the Bangladesh Power Development Board under the Private Sector Power Generation Policy of Bangladesh Act of 1996, which aims to generate private capital for the power sector.
The power development board will purchase electricity generated at the site for $0.1094/kWh, for 20 years, on a ‘no electricity, no pay' basis.
The protests come after the Ministry of Power retracted a notification issued in 2016 to acquire 459 acres in the area for solar plant construction. The retraction was made after the lands were found to be crop bearing.
That decision did not deter Ib Vogt and agricultural foods company AG Agro from recently beginning the process of acquiring 207 of the disputed 459 acres.
Protesters have alleged the land has been wrongly designated uncultivated.
Jasim Uddin, convenor of the local Land Protection Committee told pv magazine the project site produces three crops per year and there is no way it should be branded uncultivated. He said the lands were owned by the forefathers of the protesters.
“Hundreds of people will fall prey if the lands are acquired,” said Uddin, adding demonstrators have submitted a memo to the prime minister’s office seeking to block acquisition of the land by the solar project developers.
Shamsul Arefin, chairman of a local union, told pv magazine the selection of such cropland for solar development is illegal. The livelihoods of “hundreds of people” depend on the fields, he said, adding: “We cannot accept [the destruction] of fertile lands.”
Arefin said he supported the development of solar sites in the region but that facilities should be installed on uncultivated, ‘khas’ land owned by the government. “There are huge khas lands in the south of the selected area where the plant can be set up,” he said.
However Sk Abu Mahadi, country manager for ib vogt, said land scarcity in Bangladesh meant any plans for solar would face similar resistance.
“We will pay the compensation to the land owners through government channels accordingly,” he said, adding landowners would receive four times the actual value of the site in question. Mahadi told pv magazine the site in dispute was mainly char land which had previously been allotted to landless people by the government. “These lands have not been turned [in]to three-crops-land so far,” he added.

Munich-based residential vanadium redox flow battery start-up Voltstorage and the Landshut University of Applied Sciences have launched a research project to develop a prototype iron redox flow storage system based on Voltstorage's residential battery.
The proposed iron redox flow (IRF) technology is expected to make the storage system more cost-effective and suitable for applications at very high temperatures.
In the initial phase of the project, which is being funded by Germany's Federal Ministry of Research and Economics, the researchers will develop a residential storage system with a capacity of 8 kWh that is compatible with both solar and wind power installations. At a later stage, they will design a device for commercial applications that should have a storage capacity of 50 kWh.
Voltstorage said the advantages of iron electrolyte consist largely in using pure water, with the device, therefore, non-flammable, even in the event of extreme environmental conditions or malfunctions. Iron, on the other hand, can be 100% recycled, is available in large quantities worldwide, and is also particularly cheap. In addition, the storage systems built with this technology could also be installed at high temperatures, for example in subtropical and tropical regions.
The start-up aims to achieve a levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of around €0.05/kWh with this new battery, which would make iron redox flow technology the cheapest on the market. “Due to the low total costs, the IRF technology creates an ecological alternative, especially for larger, scalable commercial and industrial storage systems,” the company stated.
The iron redox flow storage system consists of two battery half-cells separated from one another by a membrane through which an electrolyte fluid is pumped in separate circuits. The electrolyte liquid is said to have been enriched with iron sulfate.
When charging and discharging, ions and electrons are transferred between the two half-cells and the energy is stored in the electrolyte. In the uncharged state, an identical oxidation state prevails in both cells and the reduction in one half-cell, and oxidation of the electrolyte in the other, only takes place during charging. In the negatively charged half-cell, the iron is released from the liquid and adheres to the electrode. The capacity of the battery is proportional to the amount of iron that can be attached to the electrode.

Some 734 petrol stations in 29 African nations have at least partially shifted from conventional grid electricity to solar, according to AFSIA, with French energy company Total at the forefront of the transition.
Total has ‘solarized' 540 petrol stations in 27 African countries, according to the report.
The AFSIA survey highlighted the plans of Zimbabwean energy company Zuva Petroleum, which wants to add solar and energy storage at 180 of its sites.
Other solar sites include the Puma service station in Windhoek, Namibia; the Oniru facility in Nigeria; OK Express locations in Wellington, South Africa; and two forecourts in Morocco; with the Ihusi station in the Democratic Republic of the Congo awaiting a hybrid system developed and installed by two AFSIA members.
Cost savings from solar and storage technology versus grid and/or diesel generator electricity are the main driver for the switch to photovoltaics, according to AFSIA.

The Spanish Institute for Diversification and Saving of Energy has allocated 255 MW of PV capacity for the Canary Islands through the Solcan rebate scheme, which refunds a percentage of installation costs using public funds.
The energy agency–part of the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism–initially expected to assign 150 MW of capacity under the program and has earmarked a €20 million budget. Projects selected under the scheme will have to begin commercial operations by the end of 2022.
Of the 65 projects awarded under the program, 36 will be located on the island of Gran Canaria, which secured 119.5 MW of generation capacity and funds of around €10 million. Fuerteventura saw 102.1 MW of allocated capacity across 18 projects, followed by Tenerife, with €2.7 million in assigned rebates and installed power of 26.6 MW. Lanzarote and La Gomera secured 6 MW and 0.7 MW, respectively.
The Solcan program is co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), which is aimed at strengthening economic and social cohesion in the European Union and correcting the imbalances between its regions.
The Canary Islands currently has around 170 MW of installed PV capacity, according to Spanish grid operator Red Electrica de Espana.

The authority has pre-selected a total of 823.06 MW of projects across two different project categories, in a tender that was once again under-subscribed.
In the first category, which comprises 20 projects with a capacity of 10 to 30 MW, the assigned capacity has reached 323.06 MW and submitted prices range from MYR0.1850/kWh ($0.049) to MYR0.2481/kWh.
As for the second category, which includes 10 projects with a capacity between 30 and 50 MW, the allocated capacity is 500 MW and the bids range from MYR0.1768/kWh ($0.0429) to MYR0.1970/kWh.
Successful developers will have until the end of 2023 to get their plants connected to the grid.
The last tender round of the LSS program attracted 112 bids, for more than 6.73 GW of generation capacity, and with a lowest solar energy price of MYR0.17777/kWh. However, energy regulator Suruhanjaya Tenaga has shortlisted only five bidders, for a total generation capacity of 490 MW.

Last week, the country’ largest utility, Liander, said that it will test a new solution developed by Amsterdam-based startup Recoy to manage the growing amount of solar power going through its grid at peak times during sunny hours. They will use demand from big electric boilers that convert electricity into heat in the form of steam and hot water.
Liander said the solution will be applied to electric boilers in Amsterdam that have capacities of more than 5 megavolt ampere and are connected to the medium-voltage grid.
“This heat is used by the businesses directly for self-consumption or used at a later time,” it said. 
Liander's customer and design director, Huibert Baud, said Recoy's tech was particularly appealing.
“We chose the Recoy solution because it is really new,” said Baud. “In the pilot, we will gain experience together with Recoy whether this really works.”
The utility said that energy-intensive buildings such as greenhouses, data centers and factories are the ideal candidates for the proposed solution. Recoy will now test its concepts in a pilot project with €30,000 ($35,790) of financial support from Alliander.
The Netherlands could reach between 38 GW and 125 GW of total installed solar capacity by 2050, according to a recent report by Netbeheer Nederland. However, existing grid constraints might limit this growth if the network is not be expanded or reinforced.
In December, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets said that the first-come, first-served principle applied by grid operators is the correct approach to manage current grid congestion. In May, the Dutch government decided that grid operators will not be required to compensate the owners of solar rooftops whose arrays are disconnected due to problems with grid capacity and voltage quality.
Grid-capacity issues are affecting the provinces of Gelderland, Noord-Holland, and parts of Flevoland, Friesland, and Zuid-Holland. There are also similar problems in parts of Groningen, Drenthe, and Overijssel.

The tender was more than eight times oversubscribed as 131 project proposals with a combined capacity of 9,440 MW were submitted for review.
“This was a record level of applications,” Eren Engur, a board member of the energy storage committee at the Turkish PV association Günder, told pv magazine. The trade body represents the Turkish Republic in the programs of IEA PVPS (International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems) and includes public and private companies and the Ministry of Energy itself.
The application documents are currently being reviewed and those developers that will be selected in the pre-qualification process will be invited to the bidding final phase soon, according to Engur.
Through the tender, the Turkish authorities want to build PV projects ranging in size from 10 to 20 MW. The projects will be located in 36 cities. The cities of Van, Antalya, Gaziantep, and Mardi will each see 50 MW of allocated capacity, while Ankara and Diyarbakır will be assigned 40 MW each. For Usak, Erzurum, Burdur, Mersin, Osmaniye, Yozgat, Batman, Agri, Aksaray and Adiyaman, the respective allocated capacity is 30 MW each. Other cities will see the remaining portion of the installed solar power.
In a document published in January in the country's official journal, the Turkish government specified that it set a ceiling price of TRY0.35/kWh ($0.047) for the procurement exercise and that winners will receive a 15-year power purchase guarantee.

The facility will be 80% financed by a €29 million loan from the London-based Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund (EAIF) which is financed by the governments of the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden and the U.K.
The balance will be provided by the developer, Montpellier-based renewables business Urbasolar SAS, which is owned by Swiss energy group Axpo. Urbasolar was selected as developer after a tender held by the energy offtaker for the project, Burkinabe state-owned electric utility La Société Nationale d’électricité du Burkina Faso.

Government plans to add a modest 5 MW of rooftop PV generation capacity to the current 2 MW of residential systems and 7 MW of ground-mounted solar projects would see the country fall far short of that goal.
Instead, IRENA has proposed reaching 199 MW of solar capacity in a near-90% clean energy system featuring 57% solar generation, and in which diesel makes up just 8%, down from its current 96%. Such a transformation would require upfront public investment of $388 million, IRENA calculated, and the government could then consider green hydrogen production to attain the final 10% of a fully renewable energy system, before rolling out electric vehicles (EVs) across the transport network by 2040.
The IRENA study modeled five future energy scenarios: an ‘optimal' system featuring modest residual diesel supply; optimal-plus-EVs; all-renewable energy mixes both with and without green hydrogen; and another all-clean-power system featuring green hydrogen and EVs.
The volume of solar capacity required on the two islands under the various scenarios ranged from 199 MW for the two ‘optimal' mixes up to 372 MW for the 100% renewable, non-green-hydrogen set-up, which would lean on solar for the highest proportion of its electricity generation, at 61%.
With the nation at present spending around 10% of its GDP on diesel imports, IRENA estimated the savings offered by its optimal scenario would run to $29.3 million per year. Crucially, the current electricity cost of $0.15/kWh in Antigua and Barbuda could be reduced to $0.105/kWh under such a generation mix, with a low of $0.09/kWh possible under the most capital intensive, all-clean-energy-plus-hydrogen-and-EVs approach.
For residents on Barbuda, who lost their energy infrastructure with the landing of Hurricane Irma in September 2017, IRENA has built upon the power mix suggested by UAE state-owned Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company in 2018. That report posited rebuilding the energy system with 719 kWp of solar capacity, 862 kWh of lithium-ion energy storage and 660 kW of generation from two diesel plants. IRENA has instead proposed 2.07 MW of solar and 4.6 MWh of storage to attain almost 95% clean power for the island, and suggested biodiesel could offer a route to 100% renewables.
IRENA said its system would see the $0.48/kWh electricity price on Barbuda fall to $0.16.
To attain its clean power ambitions, though, the authorities should improve renewables capacity procurement, train a domestic workforce for operations and maintenance and introduce electricity time-of-use tariffs to help drive the adoption of residential storage systems.
With the IRENA plan in part resting on an assumption every one of the nation's 30,000 households would be fitted with solar and storage–to supply 90 MW of the hoped-for generation capacity–the latter two options would appear to have paramount importance.

Cells built with quantum dots are known for showing high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields, due to strong defect tolerance, and high open-circuit voltages.
The researchers built the cell by integrating quantum dots (QDs) with high surface areas into a thin hybrid interfacial architecture (HIA) and by adding phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), which is one of the best-performing electron acceptors commonly used in organic photovoltaic devices, into the CsPbI3 quantum dot layer.
“PCBM was added into the CsPbI3 QDs dispersed in chlorobenzene (CB) to obtain a hybrid solution,” the scientists explained. “The CsPbI3 QDs with and without PCBM have a similar cubic shape with an average size of about 10 nm, characterized by the transmission electron microscopy.” The quantum dot solution was spin-coated onto a substrate under ambient conditions with a relative humidity lower than 10% at room temperature.
The PCBM bonds, according to the scientists, create an exciton cascade between the CsPbI3 quantum dot layer and the electron transport layer (ETL) made of Tin(IV) oxide (SnO2). The excitons have the potential to amplify the amount of electricity generated by the photons a solar cell absorbs.
The solar cell showed a power conversion efficiency of 15.1%, which the academics said is among the highest for CsPbI3 QD solar cells. “More importantly, we also obtained flexible perovskite QD solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 12.3% assisted by the HIA strategy, as well as improved mechanical flexibility relative to similar thin-film perovskite compositions,” the scientists stated.
The device is described in the study Flexible and efficient perovskite quantum dot solar cells via hybrid interfacial architecture, published in nature communications. The research group includes scientists from the Nankai University and the Soochow University in China, the Macquarie University and the University of New South Wales in Australia. and the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/15/why-human-rights-protection-is-pushing-up-pv-module-prices/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"MARCH 15, 2021",Why human rights protection is pushing up PV module prices,"From pv magazine 03/2021
Last month, I reported on various factors shaping the current PV market and module prices. In addition to political factors, there are transportation bottlenecks between Asia and the rest of the world, and supply constraints with many essential materials required in panel production. Since then, an increasing number of Asian manufacturers and suppliers have raised prices or announced increases in the period after Chinese New Year. Given the ongoing pandemic and resultant pressure on business strategies, it is highly unlikely that something unexpected will happen to relax the current situation and cause a reduction in module prices. In fact, a further increase in prices is more likely.
Supply constraints
One hand is no longer enough to count which basic materials required for continuous module production have become supply constrained, and therefore more expensive. It has become commonly accepted that polysilicon and solar glass are a challenge to source. Some industry participants are also on alert for steel and aluminum – required materials for module frames and racking products, but supplies are slowly becoming critical. Considering that these constraints are generally the result of insufficient production and transport capacities, supplies should increase within a matter of months, thanks to the re-expansion of production and shipping.
A far grimier picture presents itself in the case of precious metals, where mining and processing capacities cannot be readily expanded. Based on the Covid-19 pandemic, institutional and private speculators are pouring money into assets like platinum, silver and copper; leading to sharp price increases on the relevant commodities exchanges. Unfortunately, these precious and semi-precious metals are utilized in the production of PV cells and modules, creating further cost increases.
Grimier still, some of us might already be familiar with Xinjiang, an autonomous region in China recently mentioned in the context of forced labor. Specifically, alleged measures taken by the Chinese government to the detriment of the Uighur people, a Muslim minority in this westernmost part of China. Forced labor, wherever it may occur in the world, is cause for concern, but not many in the solar sector are aware that a large part of the globally available polysilicon, which is the raw material used to manufacture solar cells, is produced in Xinjiang. The United States has already moved towards sanctions on other materials produced in this region, including cotton and cotton-based products. The next step is to possibly extend sanctions to the import of polysilicon or, at least, to impose significant punitive tariffs on such goods. In addition, pressure is mounting on the European Union to follow suit.
Such import measures could have a dramatic impact on the global trade in solar products. 50% of the polysilicon produced in China comes from Xinjiang, amounting to a global market share of 40%. Some polysilicon manufacturers – including Daqo New Energy, TBEA, and East Hope – produce almost exclusively in this region and cannot move their heavy industry so easily. And all this is happening in an environment in which supply constraints are already elevated and the situation is challenging. It is too early to tell if the statements released by some manufacturers, in which they verbally distance themselves from the use of forced labor and human rights violations generally, can still prevent the imposition of sanctions against the solar industry. Meanwhile, reports of human rights abuses of the Uighur minority continue.
Let’s be candid – environmental and social standards are still not accorded the value they should have in our economic system. In Germany this is made plain by the currently controversial discussion surrounding a new law on global supply chains – a law that is long overdue.
This law requires companies to assess production steps across the entire supply chain to then certify that none of these steps harm the environment or violate employment conditions. The law applies to all materials and finished products sourced outside Germany. No real consequences are attached to non-compliance with this law, but it will serve to increase transparency and make greenwashing or profit maximization on the backs of workers in other countries more difficult.
Products that do not satisfy this law in Germany will also become less attractive in the market. But at the same time, European companies faced with increasingly stringent environmental and social standards, will be strengthened by such a regime. This should be in all of our interest.

Foresight Solar Fund – a U.K. renewable-energy fund with international assets that include Australia’s Longreach, Bannerton, and Oakey 1 and Oakey 2 solar farms – has released a 2020 annual report that provides insights into the performance of solar investments.
With 723 MW of ground-mounted solar installed in the United Kingdom, 124.6 MW in Spain, and 146 MW installed in Australia, Foresight named the pandemic and company efforts to protect employees as the greatest operational challenges of 2020. But despite the underperformance of its Australian assets, which were acquired in 2017 and 2018, Foresight saw continued growth in 2020.
“The recent vote by shareholders to allow an allocation to BSS of up to 10% of GAV [gross asset valley] provides an additional and exciting area of potential growth for the company,” said Chairman Alex Ohlsson. “Foresight Solar’s U.K. portfolio delivered another 12 months of positive performance, with U.K. electricity generation for the year 8.4% above base case expectations due to good irradiation levels and asset availability.”
Overall, Foresight’s Australian assets were down on revenue by about 20% compared to budget, with three solar farms posting losses in projected production due to various factors. Queensland’s 17.5 MW Longreach Solar Farm, one of 12 large-scale PV projects supported in 2016  by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and originally developed by Canadian Solar, was curtailed in 2020 due to the low capacity of a local transformer, resulting in energy production that was 14.3% less than budgeted. The grid constraint was resolved in October, with an upgrade to the transformer negotiated by the asset manager with local grid operator Ergon Energy.
The 110 MW Bannerton Solar Park was of course one of five West Murray generators curtailed to 50% of their output from September 2019 to April 2020, due to oscillation problems in that area of the grid.
Collaboration between the solar farms, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and inverter supplier SMA led to the tuning of the affected solar farms’ inverter settings. That resolved the issue, but Bannerton was also affected by lower than expected irradiation levels in the second half of the year, which led to overall underperformance of 31.3%.
Storms once again affected Oakey 2 Solar Farm in 2020, after significant damage was inflicted by hail and wind in 2018. A storm in January 2020 took out 15% of the site, which was subsequently rebuilt during the reporting period.
The project received compensation for revenue losses caused by construction delays due to the storms. The latest annual report says that tracker structures have now been “reinforced and their control system redesigned to meet the design wind speed required for the site.”
Negotiations with the network provider enabled commissioning (originally planned for 2018) to be staged as reconstruction works progressed, which clawed back some of the expected production revenue.

The expansion will give the company a total production capacity of more than 110 GWh in the U.S. market.
In addition to a new battery facility, the company and automaker GM are discussing plans to build a second joint venture plant in the United States.
LG Energy Solution invested $600 million to build a 5 GWh capacity plant in Michigan in 2012. Two years ago, it formed a joint venture with GM to build a $2.3 billion battery plant in Ohio. That facility is set for completion in 2022 and will have an annual production capacity of 35 GWh.
The latest proposed plant will produce pouch cell batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage systems, as well as cylindrical cell EV batteries. The company said it will select two candidate sites for the new plant later this year before making its final pick.
