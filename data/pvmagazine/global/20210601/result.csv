However, it has so far found limited applications only at the research level, where efficiencies have languished around the 10% mark.
Kesterites are comprised of abundant elements, most commonly copper, tin, zinc and selenium. Unlike copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) compounds that already represent a small share of PV manufacturing, all of these materials have well-established supply chains that could absorb some extra demand from the solar industry without major issue.
With this in mind, a group of researchers at Fuzhou University in China has developed a flexible bifacial kesterite (CZTSSe) PV device, which it says is suitable for applications in indoor and outer space photovoltaics.
The kesterite cell has a symmetrical configuration, with the same structure and morphology on either side. Both front and back cell stacks are deposited on molybdenum (Mo) foil. Each cell has an active area of 0.21 cm2 and is built with an electrode made of molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), a CZTSSe layer, a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, a zinc oxide (ZnO) layer, a transparent conducting coating of indium-tin-oxide (ITO), and silver (Ag).
In order to decrease manufacturing costs, the research group decided to deposit the same layers on two sides of the foil through a cyclic spin-coating method. “The spin-coating and annealing process are repeated nine times by alternating on front and back sides to obtain double-sided prefabricated CZTSSe films,” it explained. The CdS layers were deposited by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The manufacturing process also included a selenization treatment and vacuum methods for sputtering and evaporation.
The bifacial solar cell achieved an efficiency of 9.3% on the front side, with an open-circuit voltage of 436 mV, a short-circuit current of 33.76 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 63.2%. As for the backside, the cell reached a power conversion efficiency of 9.0%, an open-circuit voltage of 434 mV, a short-circuit current of 33.7 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 61.7%. “Under weak LED light illuminations with 1.5–18.5 mW/cm2 intensities, the devices also show good performance of 6–8.8% efficiency,” the researchers stated.
The unencapsulated cell was put in an aging box under continuous illumination with a standard “one sun” intensity for several days, and tested once a day. After 14 days of testing, the device showed degradation of less than 5% from its initial performance.
The bifacial PV device, according to its creators, can be bent and stretched without compromising its power conversion efficiency. The two cells are able to independently work at different illuminations and jointly output current by parallel circuit. “The bifacial device could directly utilize all-directional lights and produce periodically variable currents by substrate rotation,” the scientists concluded. “The investigations of bifacial flexible CZTSSe solar cells provide a new prospect for indoor ornament integrated photovoltaics.”
The device was described in the paper Novel symmetrical bifacial flexible CZTSSe thin film solar cells for indoor photovoltaic applications, published in nature communications.

According to CWP, the $40 billion (€32.7 billion) project promises “some of the cheapest clean energy in the world.”
Danish power company Ørsted and Copenhagen’s utility, Hofor, have entered into an agreement that will secure green power in the framework of the wider, 1.3 GW, Green Fuels for Denmark project. The two companies will coordinate on a 250 MW offshore wind farm project in the Oresund Strait, and the linked power-to-X plant. “Green Fuels for Denmark is a large scale flagship project ideally suited to realizing Denmark's great potential as a producer of sustainable fuels for heavy transport,” Anders Nordstrøm, head of Ørsted's hydrogen activities, commented in a note released on Monday. Last week, Ørsted signed an agreement with Posco Group, one of the largest conglomerates in Korea, to develop Ørsted's 1.6 GW offshore wind projects off the coast of Incheon City, in South Korea, and to conduct feasibility studies on potential collaboration on renewable hydrogen.
California-based clean energy technologies developer NewHydrogen said that researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) recently created a non-precious-metal-based catalyst that demonstrated significant improvement of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions. NewHydrogen sponsored the research. “Though the intrinsic activity and OER kinetics of the new catalyst may be somewhat lower than those of precious-metal-based catalysts,” the company said, “its low cost and high durability make it a good candidate toward the commercial water electrolysis systems operating at high current densities.” The researchers plan on scaling up the process for studies in electrolyzers in a later phase,” said NewHydrogen on Tuesday.
Danish electrolyzer maker Green Hydrogen Systems has announced its intention to launch an initial public offering on Nasdaq Copenhagen. “The contemplated IPO will enable Green Hydrogen Systems to continue to ramp up our production facilities [and] organization and to accelerate R&D efforts to reduce [the] costs of green hydrogen and make it a compelling energy carrier of the future,” the company said in a statement last week. Green Hydrogen Systems will publish a prospectus when the final decision about the IPO takes place. The plan is to raise DKK1 billion (€134 million). Green Hydrogen Systems is already teaming up with Danish companies and stakeholders, like state pension fund ATP; the Danish growth fund, Nordea; and Maersk owner A.P. Moller Holding. It is also part of the GreenHyScale project, which is applying for a €30 million grant to demonstrate a minimum 100 MW of green electrolysis based on a novel multi-megawatt-range alkaline electrolyzer platform delivered by Green Hydrogen Systems and installed at GreenLab Skive.
Belgian research centers imec and VITO, steel wire transformation and coatings company Bekaert, supermarket retail company Colruyt Group, dredging and land reclamation expert DEME, and mechanical engineering group John Cockerill, have joined forces to invest in the production of green hydrogen in Belgium. “Under the flag of Hyve, the consortium aims at a cost-efficient and sustainable production of hydrogen at a gigawatt level. “Hyve will put the Flemish region in the [driving] seat for the deployment of a hydrogen economy and the transition towards a carbon neutral industry in Europe,” the group of Flemish companies said last week. It mentioned the use of green hydrogen in the heavy transport, chemical, steel, and cement industries. “What is unique about Hyve is that the consortium is made up of parties who are developing new electrolysis components; parties who will integrate the new components into their electrolyzers; and parties who will use this infrastructure to generate green hydrogen for various purposes.”
Australia-based Global Energy Ventures has entered into a memorandum of understanding with Germany-based ILF Consulting Engineers to identify and develop green hydrogen projects in Europe and Australia, which will include GEV’s C-H2 shipping solution. “The MoU with ILF will establish GEV’s launch into Europe with one of the world’s leading engineering firms with expertise in the design and implementation of green hydrogen projects. ILF’s experience in hydrogen, strong reputation in project delivery, and long-standing relationships will be beneficial to GEV in Europe while we will also look to ILF’s expertise across the value chain for hydrogen projects in Australia,” Martin Carolan, GEV managing director, commented in a note released on Monday. The term of the MoU is valid until 31 December 2022 and can be extended by mutual agreement. Australia has now announced six of the top 20 gigawatt-scale green hydrogen projects, supported by export markets that should include Germany.

The latter will provide JA Solar with 148,000 metric tons of polysilicon over five years, JA Solar said yesterday. The shipments will be made from next month to June 2026 with the purchase price to be set monthly. JA Solar has now signed six agreements since the start of last year, to secure a supply of 565,200 metric tons of poly.
The news comes after GCL-Poly on Friday said it has told Hong Kong police about the disputed transfer of stock it held in its solar project subsidiary GCL New Energy, to a third party. pv magazine last week reported GCL-Poly unit Elite Time Global had pledged 865 million shares in the New Energy business as security for a US$60 million loan in August 2019. GCL said only US$2.2 of the loan was paid, in February last year, and the lender then claimed the loan agreement terms had been breached, three months later, and took ownership of the stock last June. The shares had been worth US$120 million in August 2019. GCL also said it wants to appoint an independent investigator to look into the matter.
China's largest solar cell manufacturer, Tongwei, has announced production of its first 210mm PERC cell at its Jintang factory. Construction of the RMB20 billion (US$3.1 billion), 30 GW manufacturing facility had started in March last year.
Almost a third of the shareholders of solar glass maker Xinyi Solar voted against issuing the board of directors with an unconditional mandate to issue and allot shares, during a vote held at the company AGM on Friday. In a separate vote, nearly 32% of stakeholders were against the issuance of shares “by shares repurchased,” and more than 11% opposed the reappointment of Paul Kwok Kin Cheng as independent non-executive director. All the AGM proposals were passed by majority vote. Similar dissent was witnessed for the shares issue mandates awarded to the board of the Xinyi Glass float glass company, whose shareholders also control Xinyi Solar. At the glassmaker, more than 23% voted against an unconditional mandate and 23% against shares issue from repurchases.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/01/new-factory-in-spain-to-repair-solar-modules/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SPAIN",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"JUNE 1, 2021",New factory in Spain to produce and repair solar modules,"From pv magazine Spain
Germany-based Rinovasol will open, this year, in the Spanish region of Navarra, a factory for the repair and manufacture of solar modules. 
The manufacturing facility will have a capacity of 50 MW and will produce what the company defines as low-power modules, specifying that these have a power output ranging from 235 W to 300 W. “But low power does not mean low quality, they will be modules with five busbars,” engineer Laura Azpilicueta, from Rinovasol, told pv magazine.
Rinovasol considers itself not just a module manufacturer but also a problem solver, for PV arrays that are more than six years old. From this threshold on, is when the modules begin to fail. “We saw very ugly things: Faulty modules that are removed and resold as is on the black market, dangerous repairs carried out without control … That is why we decided to provide a complete service in the circular economy of the panel”, she added, noting that Rinovasol is the only company that takes care of the entire process.
The German company was founded in 2014 and started by buying failing panels and fixing them on-site. Today they buy, fix and certify the panels and put them back on the market with a new datasheet and a five-year warranty. Rinovasol claims that 96.3% of the modules it buys can be retrofitted and returned to the market.
“Once the modules are purchased, the seller receives a certificate that he is no longer the owner of that panel with that frame number. We remove the cover of the junction box from the module if it has a name, and we erase the data with a laser.” The company can also provide customized services depending on the client. “We ask clients to tell us about their problem and we ‘customize' the modules according to their needs,” Azpilicueta further explained.
Rinovasol has designed a standardized process that, after analyzing the defects, is intended to improve the modules by coating them with a polymer. The polymer used is the result of a new development carried out by Rinovasol – based on material from the military and aerospace sector – for which the company has exclusive rights of use throughout the world. “We have developed our own, patented system that uses a combination of chemistry and heat,” says Azpilicueta. The end result is a recycling rate of almost 100% of the components of the solar module.
Rinovasol uses machinery from the insolvent Solarworld and also operates a 150 MW factory in Germany, where it also recycles modules at the end of their life cycle.
Some 20 people in Spain will form the workforce, which in Germany already has approximately 80 employees, “and we are planning to study a partnership with an important European utility that I cannot reveal yet”, said Azpilicueta, convinced that the demand for its services will grow in the future. In this regard, they want to organize meetings and conferences at the Navarra factory to address future improvements and developments. “We want them to visit us so that investors can see what happens inside the modules if we do not improve quality,” she concluded.

Axpo said it secured building approval last week and that the first equipment for the project's construction, including a crane, was already brought on-site with the support of a helicopter. The company explained that the dam wall, where the PV system will be deployed, is not accessible for road transport.

“For this purpose, optimal flight times and arrival and departure corridors were established with the local municipality in order to minimize the impact on the environment and the local population,” it said in a statement. “The CO2 footprint resulting from the use of the helicopter will be compensated [for] within a few months, by the plant operation.”
Construction is expected to be finalized within four months.
Axpo secured a power purchase agreement from supermarket chain Denner for the project in January.
The energy company expects the plan to deliver around 3.3 million kWh of solar power per year, around half of which will be during the winter half of the year, when electricity tends to be scarce in Switzerland.
A total of around 6,000 solar modules will be installed on an area of 10,000 square meters.

This is the main conclusion of a recent study conducted by researchers at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) – the European Commission's science and knowledge service – in which they assessed the potential for floating PV deployment at 146 hydropower reservoirs in Africa.
According to the scientists, at the end of 2019 Africa had an installed hydropower capacity of 37 GW and, currently, there is another 15 GW under development or construction that should begin commercial operations by 2025. This existing and planned hydropower capacity, however, will be under the threat of chronic droughts that have always been frequent in the continent and may now become more difficult to manage due to climate change. “Moreover, higher temperatures are expected to increase evaporation loss and the average hydropower capacity factor is expected to decline by 1.4-2.9% in the following decades,” they further explained.
Large-scale floating PV is pointed out as a power source that may help compensate for the reduction of hydropower output during dry periods and, at the same time, reduce water loss from evaporation. “In 2016, water loss due to evaporation in the African hydropower reservoirs accounted for 42 billion cubic meters, which represents more than 30 times the amount of water used to generate electricity by all the other energy technologies combined in the continent,” the academics explained.
They estimated the potential of floating PV deployment at Africa's existing hydropower reservoirs which exceed 5 MW in size by using satellite images and hydropower reservoir data. The potential of these reservoirs was evaluated under four different scenarios: One of 100% coverage of the available surface area; one of 10% coverage; one of 1% coverage; and a case, called the ‘EQIC' case, in which the installed capacity of floating PV is the same as that of the hydropower plants, and would have surface area coverage of less than 1%.
The first scenario, which the scientists describe as technically unfeasible, considered the total surface area of the 146 hydropower reservoirs – 29,222km2 as available for floating PV deployment, and found that floating arrays built there may reach an installed PV capacity of 2,922 GW. Of these reservoirs, however, 38 need more than 100% coverage of floating PV in order to equal the hydropower installed capacity and, for this reason, they were excluded from the EQIC case analysis. “The total annual electricity output with FPV [floating PV] installed in the remaining 108 reservoirs for the EQIC case, is 46.04 TWh, covering an area of less than 1% with FPV and increasing the electricity output of hydropower by 58%,” the scientists explained.
For the EQIC scenario, the research group assumed a capex [capital expense cost] of €0.40/W for utility scale floating solar and found that this technology may reach an installed capacity of 20.4 GW for the whole African continent, which would require an overall investment of €8.15 billion.
The complete datasets created by the researchers can be found in the paper Assessment of floating solar photovoltaics potential in existing hydropower reservoirs in Africa, published in Renewable Energy.

The national solar trade group, in a press release issued jointly by itself, the nuclear body and RenewableUK, on May 20, called for the government to set a 40 GW solar generation capacity target this decade, and for annual solar contracts-for-difference (CfD) auctions to help drive deployment.
The U.K. has currently pledged to hold CfD auctions every two years, with the fourth round of bidding promised “late” this year, although the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said in November, it is open to the possibility of holding the procurement rounds more regularly. The CfD regime will run until at least 2035 but BEIS consulted the renewables industry in February seeking ideas on how the subsidy element of the incentive program could be tapered down to expose clean energy projects more to wholesale energy prices.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
In CfD auctions, generators bid a strike price they will accept for the electricity they generate. Any shortfall between the day-ahead wholesale electricity price and the CfD strike price agreed is made good by the government, with the generator paying the difference when the wholesale price is higher than its strike price.
Solar Energy UK, which recently rebranded from its former guise as the Solar Trade Association, or STA, has also repeated its call for financial support to again be used to incentivize household solar and for such rooftop arrays to be exempt from VAT. The organization also wants the business rates charges applied to commercial solar installations reformed.
The potentially controversial nature of the joint press release concerns the presence of the Nuclear Industry Association, which said it wants the government to back a funding formula for new nuclear plants and to lay plans to ensure existing generation capacity is still in place “by the early 2030s.” That wording presumably implies new projects should be planned to replace the scheduled decommissioning of current nuclear reactors.
A spokesperson for Solar Energy UK told pv magazine: “Solar Energy UK doesn’t have an official position on the long-term role of nuclear in the energy mix but members of the executive team recognize that nuclear is expected to have a role in U.K. power generation in the transition to a net zero economy, owing to the government’s commitment to building new nuclear plants such as Hinkley Point C. We support establishing a level playing field for all low-carbon energy generation technologies and we see a benefit in calling for action on areas of shared interest with other energy industry bodies (i.e. net zero grid by 2035, [an] increase in carbon pricing etc).”
The third organization involved in the document is the RenewableUK trade body for non-solar clean energy generation. Members of that grouping want the government to target 30 GW of onshore wind, 2 GW of floating turbines and 5 GW of green hydrogen electrolyzer capacity this decade. The group also wants to gun for 1 GW of marine energy capacity “in the 2030s.”
The three entities say the need to clean the U.K. electricity grid is paramount because, according to statistics published by network operator National Grid ESO, the carbon intensity of electricity in the country was 5% higher in the first four months of this year than it was in January-to-April last year – despite the fact there were more weeks of Covid-19 lockdown this time around.
The trade bodies said gas-fired power generation rose 22% in the first four months of this year and the average carbon intensity of U.K. electricity in April was 20% higher than in April last year.

France deployed 546 MW of new PV systems in the first quarter of the year, from 350 MW in the preceding quarter and 192 MW in the first three months of 2020, according to new figures from the French Ministry of Ecological Transition.
The results mark the best quarter ever recorded by the country for new PV additions. The French government said that roughly 65% of all quarterly capacity additions came from PV systems above 250 kW in size.
By the end of March, the country's cumulative installed solar power had reached 11.5 GW. The total is still quite far from the 2030 target of 20 GW under the national energy strategy.
PV development is ongoing in southern mainland France. The Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Occitanie, Provence-Alpes-Côte d´Azur and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes regions together account for 68% of all newly connected power this year.
Despite the increase in installed capacity, solar PV generation fell 12% year on year in the first quarter to roughly 2.0 TWh. Solar production accounted for 1.4% of total French electricity consumption in the first quarter, down 0.2 points year on year.

The global unearthing of forced labor, draft legislation in Europe, Covid-19, and climate change are all conspiring to bring supply chain transparency into even sharper focus, demonstrating just how critical governance is in terms of environmental protection and human rights for business success.
Meanwhile, a legislative initiative drafted by the European Committee on Legal Affairs on corporate due diligence and corporate accountability is also in discussion.
The groundswell demonstrates that this new directive, submitted to the European Commission last September, is expected to be adopted later this year. If successful, it will enforce mandatory supply chain due diligence for all companies operating within the European Union, even if they are established out of the region, but are selling their products and services there.
At the end of April, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) published a set of tools, such as the Product Traceability Protocol, to support companies in proving no forced labor has been used in their supply chains.
The Solar Supply Chain Traceability Protocol is a set of guidelines intended to help solar companies meet compliance obligations and “provide customers with assurances that their solar products are free of unethical labor practices.” (Read the protocol here.) It also released a Solar Buyers’ Guide on Traceability to put forth supply chain best practices.
In a webinar on Tuesday, June 1, Nextracker, SEIA, Engie, and Micron Technology will address these critical issues. Director of Sustainability Sarah Albert will discuss improving supply chain transparency with a particular focus on the importance of being on the ground, working closely with suppliers to meet sustainability expectations, and establishing a company-wide code of conduct.

Joining her will be Evelyn Butler, Vice President of Technical Services at SEIA, who will outline the association’s newly published solar supply chain documents; Craig Murphy, Sr. Director Global Procurement Solutions, Analytics, and Product Compliance at Micron Technology who, in discussing the electronic manufacturer’s supply chain risk management, strategy, and processes, will provide insight on what lessons can be transferred to solar; and Thierry Dardeau, Procurement Category Manager – Renewable Energy at ENGIE, a customer of Nextracker, who will share the company’s responsible procurement strategy, including new supplier onboarding, exiting supplier management, integrated audit approaches and the overall importance of supply chain transparency.
In the run up to the webinar, Sarah Albert answered some questions on what the team at Nextracker is doing in this area.
Why is it so important to implement responsible procurement practices?
At present, we’re working to reduce our environmental footprint and in a company like Nextracker, working proactively with key stakeholders in our supply chain is a way to this just that. However, taking a holistic approach to implementing sustainability in to the procurement process is critical to build a resilient supply chain with properly managed risk mitigation. In the case of Nextracker, the growth we’ve experienced over the last few years has increased the complexity of our supply chain network and the only way to efficiently manage the process is by incorporating sustainability into our procurement practice.
Do customers really care? 
Absolutely. Responsible procurement comes up in nearly every customer meeting that we have and is often the most pressing question. We’re seeing the industry’s standards and expectations change very rapidly in this space which has provided us with a great opportunity to step up and demonstrate our commitment and dedication to improve.
At Nextracker, you’re looking to implement a sustainability engagement initiative and responsible procurement program (RPP) with your supplier partners. How does a company best approach suppliers about these issues? 
We meet our suppliers where they are. That means respecting and valuing their work, their cultural norms, language, and inviting them to the table to dialogue rather than a one-way conversation.
What are the key considerations in such initiatives and programs? 
We believe that to become true partners, we must invest in the capacity-building of our suppliers. We bring in third party vendors to provide customized training, risk assessment, and onsite audits. We always have a strategy but recognize that we must be flexible as we get to know each supplier better and make sure that we’re transitioning the knowledge we bring in from third party vendors in-house so that eventually the know-how becomes native and operational.
You recently wrote, “Much of what I learned from the employees and observed during my time on the factory floors led to Flex programs that have helped improve working conditions and expand workplace benefits.” Can you provide specific examples of improvements made? 
Factory floors are my favorite part of my job. I could go on forever about this topic. I’ve learned lessons such as the importance of safe, clean workplaces as well as safe and clean living accommodations to more complex issues such as managing communication and cooperation between different generations of workers. We’ve also worked on training managers to be less top-down focused in their management style and the importance of competitive compensation.
Final thoughts?
Tackling responsible procurement is a daunting task yet the solar industry can observe from other industries that meaningful strides are possible. I’m constantly learning and evolving my point of view and looking to learn from other industries for insights. We aren’t reinventing the wheel – it’s about communication. The most important component is an open dialogue between customer and supplier and to have local teams in each region to adapt to cultural norms and needs.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/01/turning-nepals-solar-game-around/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,NEPAL",,"JUNE 1, 2021",Turning Nepal’s solar game around,"Nepal is a mountainous landlocked country situated between India and China. It comprises over 6,000 rivers featuring rivulets and tributaries totaling 45,000 km in length.
Rich in renewable water resources, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates the country has the potential to produce 83,000 MW of electricity, of which around 43,000 MW are thought to be economically viable.
Despite its enormous hydroelectric potential and absence of fossil fuel reserves, it was not until recently that Nepal began focusing on hydroelectric power. This development has come with problems, however. In particular, there is a deficiency of electricity generation in the dry season when demand rises, and water flow diminishes.
Though the installed electricity generation capacity of Nepal has grown steadily, peak demand has also increased at a higher rate and as per the data for 2016, energy imports from India doubled for an average annual growth rate of 20.4%, compared with a 0.3% annual increase in Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) generation.
Owing to this situation, in 2016, Kulman Ghising, Managing Director of the NEA, took steps to increase domestic generation, reduce system losses and increase cross border transmission capacity for electricity imports from India, and gradually decrease the load shedding hours.
Hence, load shedding (Nepal faced 16 hours of load shedding between 2008-2016) has been officially eliminated since May 13, 2018 . This was possible due to imports totaling around 145 MW of power from India via the Dhalkebar – Mujaharpur Transmission line in FY 2018/19. The eradication of load shedding also prompted a reform to Nepal’s energy sector.
Understanding the energy mix and its long-term implications for Nepal’s energy sector, Ghising re-initiated the World Bank’s Grid Solar and Energy Efficiency Project agreed between the World Bank and the NEA in 2014.
The NEA also signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the private sector for the purchase of solar energy and national grid connection. Moreover, in December 2016, ADB announced a US$20 million grant to promote private sector investment in utility-scale solar power. This funding was to ensure the installation of at least 25 MW of solar capacity by 2018 and was to be provided to private sector as viability gap funding.
Though there were a few bidders interested in developing the solar projects, to date none have been realized. This is because financial institutions and banks remain unconvinced of the financial viability of solar projects, despite the government’s promotion of alternative energy sources for electricity.
In FY2019/20, the total energy imported from India decreased by 38.55% compared to FY2018/19. Despite this, the total available energy in the system increased by 2.51% to 7,741 GWh in FY2019/20 over the corresponding figure of 7,551 GWh in FY 2018/19. Out of total available energy, total domestic generation is 77.67%, while imported electricity from India accounted for 22.33%.
In order to be self-dependent, as well as stimulate the market for energy exports to neighboring nations, the NEA under the leadership of MD Kulman Ghising decided to install solar projects that would meet the energy demand in dry seasons. Thus, the first stage of 25 MW solar project – 1.5 MW – was constructed and connected to the hydro-dominated national grid in June 2020. This was an NEA solar project constructed through the World Bank’s Grid Solar and Energy Efficiency Project.
The transition for Nepal’s solar energy sector came in 2019/20 when the Prime Commercial Bank approved financing for the 10 MW Mithila Solar PV Project by Eco Power Development Pvt. Ltd. However, despite the financial closure, in the absence of a proper EPC partner and understanding of the technology, Eco Power Development did not install the project.
An EPC agreement was eventually signed in 2020 with Sandeep Agrawal, managing director of Kushal Projects Nepal Pvt. Ltd who convinced Eco Power of his experience in the field of solar.
In February 2020, after all required documentation was secured, the bank loan was paid in March 2020, and in the April, a Letter of Credit (LC) for the products was opened. To initiate the project, a team comprising engineers and other trained manpower were recruited from India. It reached the site on June 29, 2020.
Various challenges were faced, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and unpredicted heavy rainfall. Thus, governmental officials were not convinced that the project could be implemented in such a short span, which led to regular monitoring for quality assurance. Finally, the project was completed within a period of seven months and on February 16, 2021, was connected to the national grid at Dhalkebar.
The average generation of the solar plant is more than 50,000 units per day. This has proved that such projects can generate electricity and can be a potential alternative source for energy generation for Nepal. The local population also benefitted as they can generate revenue against the land lease and undertake employment opportunities in the project. The successful installation of the project has been a particular achievement, because it feeds into the same grid as the electricity imported from India. Thus, the government has decided that Nepal will import 10 MW less from India.
Overall, Nepal is starting to see growth in the development of solar and there are around 300 MW of projects in the pipeline at present.

Evolar, based in Uppsala, Sweden is working on a solution for perovskite tandem cell production, and says it will soon be offering a turnkey production solution that will have customers producing perovskite solar cells with 18 months of signing a contract.
The company is led by the founders of now-insolvent CIGS thin-film producer Solibro, and says it is now looking to apply both its experience and technology to perovskite cell production. “Evolar’s thin-film tandem cells are based on perovskite rather than CIGS. But much of the underlying manufacturing process is the same,” said Evolar CTO Olle Lundberg. “We have the experience, the technology, and the techniques for installing commercially viable thin-film production lines at any solar cell manufacturing plant.”
Evolar is currently operating a pilot production line at its headquarters in Uppsala, Sweden, – using a “unique evaporation technology” to deposit perovskite layers onto conventional solar cells. The company plans to offer this “PV Power Booster” technology as a turnkey solution that can be integrated into existing module production facilities.
Magnora has not disclosed financial details of the deal with Evolar, but says the acquisition will be financed through existing cash holdings and that the share price is similar to the original acquisition made last year.
The investor says it made the decision to increase its share after “all milestones from the original business plan” were reached. It also says it has cash at hand for the two remaining options which, if exercised, would increase its share in Evolar to 63.5%.

The latter is a method to map an input to an output using fuzzy logic. Through this process, values of the input vector can be interpreted and, on the basis of some sets of fuzzy rules, corresponding values to the output vector can be assigned. The ANFIS method combines both neural networks and fuzzy logic principles within a single framework and, according to the Chinese group, is more accurate than fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks operating separately.
“Combining the ANN and fuzzy-set theory can provide advantages and overcome the disadvantages in both techniques,” the academics stated. “The ANFIS model can be trained without relying solely on expert knowledge sufficient for a fuzzy logic model.”
The model comprises seven inputs and one output. The seven input variables are I1 (Amperes), V1 (Volts), I2(Amperes), V2 (Volts), Irradiance (Klux), Temperature (°C), and Weather (sunny/cloudy), and the output variable is the fault state of the PV system.
The proposed ANFIS approach was tested on a 1.8 kW PV system’s experimental setup with both grid partitioning (GD) for hourly solar radiation forecasting and subtractive clustering (SC), which is an algorithm used to generate the tuned membership functions automatically in accordance to the domain knowledge and is the base to set up adaptive network inference systems.
The methodology was found to be able to accurately detect PV fault states. “The proposed ANFIS SC methodology is superior to the ANFIS GP technique in accurately detecting PV fault states,” the researchers concluded, adding that the new technique was also able to accurately track the experimental data in comparison to soft-computing techniques.
The detection system is presented in the paper A smart fault detection approach for PV modules using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference framework, published in Energy Reports.

In its latest quarterly report, India Solar Compass Q1 2021, Bridge to India said that it expects India to add 1.35 GW of utility-scale solar in the April-June period, down 43% from its initial estimate for 2.35 GW. 
Installations will likely recover in the third quarter, with capacity additions expected to hit 2.47 GW, Bridge to India said. It noted that India added 2.1 GW of grid-connected solar capacity in the first quarter of 2021, up 33% from the preceding quarter. The new capacity additions included 1.74 GW of utility-scale solar and 370 MW pf rooftop PV.
India had a total installed PV capacity of about 44.2 GW as of March 31. This included 35.9 GW of utility-scale PV, 7.16 GW of rooftop solar, and 1.14 GW of off-grid PV capacity. 
Total PV capacity in the national pipeline stood at 52,392 MW on March 31, according to Bridge to India.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/01/batteries-boom-in-australia-as-renewable-investments-decline/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"JUNE 1, 2021",Batteries boom in Australia as renewable investments decline,"From pv magazine Australia
Australia's Clean Energy Council (CEC) put out alarming data last week showing a shift in large-scale renewable energy investment. While battery storage has seen a 300% year-on-year increase in the first quarter of 2021, there has been a dramatic decline in investments in large-scale renewable projects, with financial commitments for large solar and wind farms falling to the lowest levels seen in five years.
New England Solar farm near Uralla, New South Wales, was the only project to reach financial close in the first quarter of this year. Its 400 MW of capacity is also a 40% drop on capacity committed in the previous quarter and 30% lower than the 2020 quarterly average.
“Confidence for new investment in the sector is really in limbo at the moment,” said Clean Energy Council (CEC) Chief Executive Kane Thornton. He noted that projects are experiencing “significant and often unanticipated delays through the grid connection process,” and claimed that government intervention in the energy market is adding to “uncertainty for investors.”
Sally Torgoman, infrastructure lead advisory for the energy practice at PwC, agrees. She said that grid risks must be factored into every stage of a renewable energy project.
She confirmed at a recent Smart Energy Summit that achieving grid connection for a large-scale development typically takes two to four years and costs upwards of AUD 1 million (USD 774,000). She also said that the risks posed by the grid continues into the operational phase of projects in the form of changing marginal loss factors, which measure energy likely to be lost between the point of generation and the point of demand. She also noted the possibility of curtailment in response to grid instability and other possible requirements to mitigate problems with the grid.
PwC recently surveyed 50 renewable energy experts in the Australian market to discover whether everyone was having the same problems.
“It’s very rare that you run a survey and get 100% of participants saying the same thing, but 100% of the experts said that the No. 1 issue in the National Electricity Market [NEM] is underinvestment in transmission and distribution, followed by slow grid connection processes,” Torgoman said.
She told pv magazine Australia that investment would likely decline if there are no boundaries around the level of intervention that the government might make in the market. Recent Australian federal government interventions have included investing taxpayer dollars in the development of Snowy 2.0, and more recently in development of a gas-peaking plant at Kurri Kurri on the central coast of New South Wales.
This despite this year’s research by the CEC, which found that large-scale battery storage is superior in terms of reaction times, operational costs, and emissions to gas plants for delivering electricity peaking services.
“In a market that’s really about managing supply and demand in a timely way, investors don’t know when the government will plonk down another couple of hundred megawatts of assets to insure against closure of Liddell,” said Torgoman. “Or whether it will allow the private sector to invest its own money to meet the approaching supply shortage.”
Monique Miller, executive director and head of solar and dispatchable renewables at Clean Energy Finance Corp., spoke after Torgoman at the Smart Energy Summit this month. “Global investors are looking to double holdings in sustainable investments to 2025,” she said.
Torgoman said that there’s “plenty of liquidity in the market and investors are very keen to invest in environmental, social and governance (ESG) related projects, particularly in renewables.”
She and Thornton echo the voices of many industry experts who say that Australia has a tremendous opportunity to become the choice of renewables investors. “We desperately need new generation,” said Torgoman, noting that upwards of 40 GW of renewable energy will be required to replace the output of retiring coal-fired power plants and meet electricity demand.
Investment in batteries also makes sense, Torgoman said, because they offer a number of benefits. These include securing the stability of the grid, while allowing the deferral of capital investment in major grid upgrades. At this point in time, batteries also offer longer asset lives than before, and pricing is more attractive now. Torgoman said it’s become “good business to consider whether upgrading a power line or a substation can be dealt with more effectively with a battery.”
Battery energy storage also allows the time-shifting of excess renewable generation at certain times of day into low-generation, but high-demand periods.
“But that actually means again that we have to remember the important role that transmission and grid connections play,” Torgoman said. “The grid is an unavoidable requirement.”
Among the remedies to the “financially and psychologically” painful problems of effectively quantifying risks the grid in its current state poses to investors, said Torgoman, is a more transparent process that helps investors and developers understand the limitations and accordingly cost them. She said the current multi-faceted, multi-party process of grid connection, for example – which puts the onus on investors to understand grid capacity and complex modeling – could be clarified.
She said that some parts of the process are up for interpretation, and yet there is no third party to which one can refer a grid-connection decision made within Australian Energy Market Operator for review. The result is that investors end up “having this one-way conversation that becomes quite hard,” she claimed.
Thornton from the CEC said that the reduction in financial commitments to clean energy generation is “a deeply disturbing trend.” Just as countries throughout the world are recognizing the need to accelerate their investment in renewable energy, the brakes are being applied to “Australia’s promise as a renewable energy superpower,” he concludes.
