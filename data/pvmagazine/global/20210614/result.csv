The World Bank's private-sector arm, the International Finance Corp (IFC), said it would work with Niger's Ministry of Petroleum, Energy and Renewable Energy and state-owned utility Société Nigérienne d'Électricité to attract private-sector investment to help tender and develop 50 MW of solar generation capacity.
That would amount to around 20% of the nation's total power generation capacity, said the IFC on its website today, as the government aims to source 30% of its power from renewables by 2035.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/14/scotland-announces-massive-plan-for-heat-pump-deployment/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 14, 2021",Scotland announces massive plan for heat pump deployment,"The Scottish government has published the first interim report of the Heat Pump Sector Deal Expert Advisory Group, which is a group of professionals supporting the nation's ministry to put in place a scheme to support the massive deployment of heat pumps.
“This is the sort of challenge where a sector deal involving key stakeholders in a broad partnership can make all the difference, ensuring that all the necessary building blocks are in place to drive rapid progress to a specific goal, including the necessary public engagement,” the paper's authors wrote.
Through this initiative, the Scottish government wants to deploy renewable-powered heat pumps on at least 1 million homes and 50,000 non-domestic buildings by the end of this decade. “One immediate thing it can do is use its powers of regulation and planning to drive installation of zero-carbon heating in both old and new buildings, including creating a definitive ‘market moment’ by announcing an end date for fossil fuel heating installation,” the document reads. “A further action which can be taken rapidly, is to directly incorporate the ambitious targets in its own programs.”
These two actions combined, according to the group's experts, will be key to providing the necessary volumes for the creation of a supply chain and price reductions. Another crucial step will be creating awareness of this heating technology among consumers. “Significant effort and resources will be required but most actions proposed are a ramping up or extension of existing activity, albeit at considerable pace and scale, and so there is much to build on,” they further explained. “If the Scottish government follows the recommendations set out in this report, we are confident that [its] ambitious goals for heat pump deployment can be met.”
Similar efforts are currently being made in the Netherlands, where the Dutch association of national-regional electricity and gas network operators, Netbeheer Nederland, are leading a plan to deploy up to 2 million hybrid heat pumps by 2030. The plan should be supported by a subsidy scheme by the government and enable the installation of at least 100,000 heat pumps per year from 2024.

However, progress is not as tardy as might have been presumed, according to utility Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), which said the first slice of the 900 MW fifth phase will be commissioned next month. pv magazine had reported, in February 2019, the fifth phase would be commissioned before July.
Confusingly, the first sections of generation capacity planned in the fourth phase of the solar field are not due to take shape until September.
A statement published on the DEWA website yesterday, said the emirati power company expects to commission 300 MW of solar and 300 MW of concentrating solar power (CSP) generation capacity this year. If achieved, that would mean 10% of Dubai's power generation mix would be comprised of clean power capacity next month, rising to 12% by the end of the year. The park has had 1,013 MW of capacity online since its third phase was completed in November.
The authority said 300 MW of conventional solar generation capacity would come online in July as part of stage one of the fifth phase, under development by Saudi energy company ACWA Power, which said it had closed financing of $564 million for the facility in September and for which it has agreed to accept a world record low price for solar of $0.016953 per kilowatt-hour generated.
That first section of the 900 MW fifth phase of the project will be followed, in September, by 100 MW of CSP generation capacity with the construction of what DEWA is calling “the world's tallest CSP tower, at 262.44m.” Once the tower is commissioned, the utility added, a further 200 MW of CSP generation capacity would be installed – in the form of the parabolic trough associated with the tower – “by the end of the year.”
The cost of the 950 MW fourth phase of the solar field appears to have potentially risen, from the AED15.8 billion ($4.3 billion) previously reported, to “up to AED16 billion,” according to DEWA.
The huge complex is intended to reach a final 5 GW of generation capacity this decade.

State-owned NTPC Limited, India’s largest power generator, is seeking expressions of interest (EoI) to set up hydrogen-based fuel cell systems to provide back-up power and be used in microgrid applications. The EoI documents explain a separate project is envisioned for each application with the hydrogen to be produced by an electrolyzer.
Under the project, NTPC would install the hydrogen-based fuel cell-electrolyzers as pilots with a view to rolling out such systems as a green alternative to diesel generation.
In one pilot project, NTPC aims to replace around 500-1,000 kW of diesel generator capacity which provides back-up power for its offices in Noida, with an electrolyzer. The project includes an on-site electrolyzer to produce the hydrogen needed.
In the other scheme, the power company would set up a 50 kW electrolyzer-fuel-cell-based microgrid at one of its guest houses at NTPC Simhadri, in Visakhapatnam in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The electrolyzer would generate the sustainable fuel during the day and provide electricity at night, via the fuel cell.
“There are multiple possible fuel cell and electrolyzer technologies to create back-up power and [a] microgrid solution,” stated the EoI document. “The responses shall be evaluated regarding various factors, with the key[s] being, expertise of the applicant, technology, capital cost, efficiency, reliability, maintenance challenges, and [the proposed] contribution to capital investment. The interested applicants will specify the technical specification [and] the total estimated project cost, and shall propose the financial contribution to be shared by themselves and by NTPC.”
The document continued: “NTPC would implement the project either on [a] nomination basis or through [a] request for proposal (RFP) process amongst the shortlisted parties identified through this EoI process. The intellectual property generated from the pilot projects (a first-of-its-kind in India) will be co-owned by NTPC and the applicant. The same, may be monetized separately during the commercialization of the technologies.”

Spanish EPC contractor Prodiel and Spain-based renewable investment asset manager Everwood Capital, have announced the creation of DVP Solar, a joint venture that will specialize in the development of large scale photovoltaic projects.
In a statement to pv magazine, a spokesperson from Prodiel explained that the new entity will be 50% owned by both companies. “The joint venture will provide a comprehensive response … throughout the value chain, to the international growth of photovoltaic solar energy, with [a] special focus on the main European markets and selected Latin American markets,” the spokesperson added.
DVP Solar has projects in Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Colombia and Peru, and is currently managing 5 GW of operational solar plants. Furthermore, it has another 2 GW of projects in the initial development phase and expects to develop another 3 GW for the next few years.
“DVP Solar will be backed, on the one hand, by the trajectory and knowledge of the sector provided by a company such as Grupo Prodiel, which provides DVP Solar with its development team and, on the other side, by the financial capacity and the experience in investments and management of assets that Everwood Capital offers,” said the joint venture's president, Ángel Haro.
Currently, the company is made up of more than 70 professionals, all with proven experience in renewable energies and whose executive management depends on Eduardo Criado, CEO of DVP Solar. “We have a solid commitment to make DVP Solar a leading company in the international promotion of photovoltaic projects,” said Alfredo Fernández, a founding partner of Everwood Capital.
This is not the first alliance between the two companies. In November, Everwood Capital bought 1,098 MW from Prodiel. The projects accounted for most of the investment in Everwood's new Fund V, dedicated to the construction of merchant photovoltaic projects in southern Europe, especially in the Iberian peninsula and Italy. The agreement entailed the purchase of 870 MW in the community of Madrid, and 228 MW in Seville and Badajoz, and contemplated a right to purchase another 500 MW from Prodiel.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/14/photovoltaics-and-geothermal-heat-pumps-for-domestic-hot-water-heating/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FINLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 14, 2021",Photovoltaics and geothermal heat pumps for domestic hot water heating,"Researchers from the Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) have outlined a series of control methods for domestic hot water (DHW) heating produced by a ground source heat pump (GSHP), in combination with a rooftop PV system, in Nordic climates.
GSHPs, which are also known as geothermal heat pumps, utilize shallow-ground energy to achieve space heating and cooling and are able to transfer heat to or from the ground.
The four methods were tested on two system configurations located in Finland. One system is based on an F1255-12 R EM heat pump with a capacity of 12 kW provided by U.K.-based provider Nibe Energy Systems Limited, and an east-south-west-oriented 21 kW rooftop PV system. The second system relies on the same kind of heat pump and a 5 kW south-oriented solar array.
Both systems include a hot water storage tank with a capacity of 500 liters and, for both configurations, solar power is first used to meet the requirements of the baseload demand of the household and then is made available for DHW heating. Space heating is not provided by the proposed solution and the heat pump is used exclusively to heat the hot water tank storage.
“Energy consumption of DHW is calculated by assuming that the house is a typical four-person household with a DHW consumption of 200l per day,” the researchers specified. “The cold inlet water temperature is assumed to be 10 degrees Celsius, while the hot outlet water temperature is 60 degrees Celsius.” Based on these data, the electricity demand for DHW was found to be 11.64 kWh per day. Heating is performed between 8.00 a.m. and 8.00 p.m.
With the first of the four methods, which the Finnish group defined as a “base case,” the water tank is heated from 45 to 55 degrees Celsius twice a day and the highest consumption peaks occur in the morning and in the evening. As for the second method, which the scientists called “clock control,” the tank is heated once a day from 45 to 65 degrees Celsius, and heating is carried out mostly at noon hours when PV power generation is higher.
The third method, which was labeled as “energy-optimal,” is aimed at optimizing the coefficient of performance (COP) value of the heat pump. The COP defines the ratio between the useful heat transfer for heating or cooling and the required drive energy. This approach is said to reduce electricity consumption in water heating by maintaining the storage tank temperature at 45 degrees Celsius. “The low chosen-temperature limit can be justified by the fact that it is just enough to guarantee the comforts provided by hot water,” the academics explained.
The fourth method, dubbed as “cost-optimal,” is intended at minimizing heating costs and using cheap grid electricity together with solar power. Under this configuration, water is heated once a day, from 45 to 64 degrees Celsius, and heating duration is established based on the COP curve, DHW demand, PV generation forecasts, and expected spot market prices.
“The results in the period between June and September 2020 show that the developed cost-optimal control reduces DHW heating costs compared with the other three control cases, even with the use of an actual PV output forecast,” the research team stated. “Considering the share of PV production in DHW heating, the cost-optimal control with the 5 kWp PV system shows a greater PV production share than the other three control methods, even though the imperfect PV forecast is used.”
With the 21 kW array, the share of solar power is higher in the clock control than in the cost-optimal approach and, if PV forecasts are accurate, DHW heating costs are lower. “The simulation results also indicate that as the size of the PV system increases, the accuracy of the PV production forecast loses its significance,” it further explained. “In the case of the 21.1 kWp PV system, the heating cost increased by 9% when the actual PV forecast was applied, instead of the perfect forecast while, in the 5 kWp case, the heating cost increased by 11%.”
The four approaches are described in the paper Ground source heat pump control methods for solar photovoltaic-assisted domestic hot water heating, published in Renewable Energy.

The perovskite layer for the cell, which has an “n-i-p” layout, was fabricated with a metal-halide capping layer placed on top of a three-dimensional metal-halide perovskite film. This design provide hermetically sealed encapsulation, which is traditionally difficult in flexible perovskite cells, and also enhances the photocarrier properties at the interface between the perovskite film and the hole transport layer (HTL).
“This low-dimensional (LD) MHP capping layer not only reduces the propensity for fracture in bending but also provides protection against ingression of environmental species,” they explained in “Flexible perovskite solar cells with simultaneously improved efficiency, operational stability, and mechanical reliability,” which was recently published in Joule.
The MHP precursor was deposited through spin-coating on substrates made of fluorinated tin-oxide (FTO) and glass, followed by thermal annealing at 100 C. The perovskite layer was then sandwiched between a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL) and an HTL made of Spiro-OMeTAD. Indium tin oxide (ITO) and gold (Au) were used as conducting electrodes on either side of the cell.
The device showed a short-circuit current density of 23.5 mA.cm2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.15 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.779, and a power conversion efficiency of 21.0%. The academics described these results as unprecedented. A cell with the same architecture but without the LD MHP capping exhibited an efficiency of 18.4%. The cell with LD MHP capping also showed a degradation to only 90% of the initial efficiency after 800 hours, while the device without capping degraded to 79% after 475 hours.
The researchers also analyzed the solar cell through cyclic bend testing and found that LD/3D MHP thin films have “unprecedented” bending durability, as the cells can retain 81% of their initial efficiency after 20,000 cycles. This value for the cells without the capping layer was just 54%.
“This resistance to cracking in LD/3D MHP thin films has cascading beneficial effects,” the researchers said. “First, the LD MHP capping layer, in addition to protecting the underlying 3D MHP thin film from environmental degradation, reduces cracking in the 3D MHP thin film, which further prevents environmental attack.”
The research group included scientists from Brown University in the United States and École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, as well as the Dalian University of Technology and Shaanxi Normal University in China.
*The article was amended on June 15 to specify that one of the cell's electrodes is made of gold and not silver, as we previously reported.

India’s mission to deploy some 2 million off-grid solar-powered irrigation pumps by 2022 has made sluggish progress, with only one-eighth of the target achieved so far, according to a new report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
“Solar-powered irrigation is a huge opportunity for India,” said author Kashish Shah, IEEFA research analyst. “But despite the clear multiple commercial benefits, the rollout of solar pumps has been much slower than anticipated.”
The report calls for a renewed push on the installation of solar-powered pumps under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s INR34,422 crore ($4.7 billion) PM-KUSUM scheme, which has a 2022 target of 30.8 GW of solar capacity (revised from 25.75 GW earlier), including about 2 million off-grid pumps.
According to data from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, against an ambitious target of installing 2 million off-grid solar pumps, only 246,000 pumps were installed by the end of fiscal 2019-20. The PM-KUSUM scheme should have accelerated the process of pump deployment, however, the report noted only 8,900 pumps were deployed in the 12 months after the formalization of the scheme.
By comparison, the number of fossil-fuel-powered water pumps in India totals more than 8.8 million.
Benefits, bottlenecks
Compared to utility-scale solar, distributed PV generation reduces the need to expand transmission capacity and doesn’t require large land areas.
Shah said increasing distributed solar capacity through the installation of solar pumps could support India’s near-term renewable energy target of 175 GW by 2022, including 100GW of solar capacity.
“Replacing fleets of diesel generators in the agricultural sector would reduce emissions and air pollution and contribute to the government’s efforts to promote a self-reliant India by reducing reliance on costly, subsidized diesel imports,” Shah said. “Solar pumps would also reduce the burden on distribution companies (discoms) of providing highly subsidized power to the agricultural sector. This could potentially even lead to reductions in tariffs for commercial and industrial consumers who cross-subsidize electricity for agriculture.”
The report cited a lack of coordination among state-level bodies, affordability, asset ownership, and technology as key challenges impeding India’s uptake of solar pumps. It noted information asymmetry across state discoms, agricultural departments, minor irrigation departments, and other state-designated departments in the scheme implementation. The report also said that different models of asset ownership – farmer, discom, or developer – could play a significant role in the resulting viability of the pump sets.
“When it comes to implementing the scheme by the states, it’s a case of one size does not fit all,” says Shah.  “Different models of pump ownership could work for different states or even different districts, depending on the dynamics of the agricultural and power sectors in that area. Each state needs to zero in on which mode of solarising its agricultural power demand – off-grid or on-grid – works best for them.”
The report looked at the progress of solar pump deployment in three states: Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. It noted the ambitious approach taken by Andhra Pradesh to solarize the state’s entire agricultural demand through distributed solar, as well as using the enormous cost advantages of centralized utility-scale solar as an alternative.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/14/takeaways-from-the-pvel-2021-reliability-scorecard/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 14, 2021",Takeaways from the PVEL 2021 reliability scorecard,"From pv magazine USA
PV Evolution Labs (PVEL) has released its 2021 Reliability Scorecard. The annual publication is a collection of results from solar panel stress tests focused on specified and verified subcomponent bills of materials.
A few highlights from this year’s results:
The group’s newest product test, the Mechanical Street Sequence (MSS), seeks to discover how larger solar panels now deployed in more complex environments will potentially develop microcracks and degrade over the next several decades.
PVEL said that its MSS aligns with the forthcoming IEC 63209 technical specification for extended reliability testing. It said the IEC 61215 certification standard only requires static mechanical loading, and PV modules will pass if they exhibit no visible damage when evaluated by eye and have less than 5% power loss.
To start all testing processes, including this MSS, PVEL observes the production of each solar panel they test, from the opening of the raw materials through every step of production, until they are palletized and shipped with tamper-proof tape. The below electroluminescence imaging shows a  panel’s progression through the three main steps of MSS – static mechanical load (SML) – #2, dynamic mechanical load (DML) – #3, and environmental stress – #4.

In the SML testing phase, modules are mounted on two rails and secured at typical ground-mount clamping locations. They then undergo three rounds of one-hour downforce and one-hour up-force at 2,400 pascals.
For the DML testing, there are 1,000 cycles of alternating positive and negative loading at 1,000 pascals. As part of the simulated environmental stress, modules undergo 50 thermal cycles from 85 C to -40 C, then 10 cycles of humidity freeze, high heat, and humidity followed by a rapid drop to freezing temperatures.
The report said that, in general, solar panels from the last five years show higher levels of field degradation. This should not be too surprising as more than half of the world’s solar deployment has occurred over the same time period.
If we were to focus on one technology among the many which make up a modern solar panel, the report suggested that module encapsulation should get our attention. Variations in the encapsulant formulations were the primary factor affecting the degradation rate.
An aerial-infrared analysis submitted with the report by Heliolytics showed that a manufacturer’s size does not correlate with field reliability. As we can see in the chart, below, large- and small-scale manufacturers (blue versus green, respectively) are  evenly mixed.

The list of manufacturers with a bill of materials that performed well enough to garner a spot on the PVEL Top Performers list can be found in their Twitter feed. Below, we’ve highlighted the manufacturers that made the list for the first time this year:
While the solar panel failure rates noted here are trivial for residential and small commercial customers with even 100 panels, the higher failure rates will add significant labor hours when it comes to gigawatt-scale facilities.

As we humans scramble to address climate change with renewable energy, the real paydirt in solar might actually be dirt.
Think of it in terms of multiple scientific and economic interests converging on the soil just below your photovoltaic panels. The panels provide an opportunity to restore natural ecosystems and reduce soil erosion, all while reducing the electric power grid’s carbon footprint.
For example, Minnesota and Iowa used to be home to an estimated 25 million acres of tallgrass prairie. Due to agriculture, these ecologically diverse habitats are almost functionally extinct, as barely 1% of those tallgrass acres remain.

From an emissions-capturing standpoint, these native grassland habitats are important because they sequester almost 60% more carbon per acre than modern agricultural activities.
Seeking to understand the environmental effects solar power has on these properties, a collaboration between researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and the University of Minnesota analyzed solar power facilities that integrate natural grasses.
The study modeled and averaged solar facilities in seven states in the Upper Midwest. Their modeling suggests that native grasses planted as part of 10 GW of solar generation capacity would sequester 129.3 tons of carbon per hectare; that is 65% and 35% greater than either an agriculture or a solar-turfgrass scenario, respectively.
The researchers said that this volume of emission sequestration is equivalent to the emission savings of 5,000 GWh of fossil generation shifting to solar power, which would correspond to greater than 3 GW of solar capacity.
The paper found that in addition to carbon sequestration, native grassland habitats also produce a three-fold increase in habitat for local pollinators, like bees and butterflies, when compared to pure agricultural usage. The threat of erosion from poor management still looms for midwestern soil. Solar and native grasslands would protect this fertile asset from losses of up to 9,000 tons of sediment erosion annually, and would retain more than 40,000,000 cubic meters of water from runoff annually.
Prior observational research has shown that solar panels create microclimates in semi-arid regions by significantly increasing the water retention in soil, which in turn increases sheep and cow grazing grasses by 90%.
Land conscious
The solar industry is already conscious of land use challenges. Deals sometimes fall apart because people push back over issues related to land use. Their concerns include perceived home value depreciation, the losses of a rural lifestyle, and the risk of agricultural capacity depletion.
Two years ago, solar developer Silicon Ranch launched a “holistic solar land management program” known as Regenerative Energy. The group’s aspirations include:
Recently, a 2.4 GW portfolio of agrivoltaic projects changed hands, while a large developer put out a call for innovative agrivoltaic ideas, and solar interests in France started an agrivoltaic association.
We are going to build the solar. We already have the sites. The question is, how will it get built?
Solar vs corn?
And speaking of agriculture, did you know that all growth in corn use since 1980 went to make alcohol for fuel? Roughly 25% of the United States’ corn acreage is used specifically to generate biofuels, which represents only around 10% of all transportation fuel.
‘Crops to create that amount of fuel is currently using somewhere between 14 and 20 million acres of land. If that same acreage were used for solar electricity generation, we would produce an eye-popping 1.8-2.5 TWdc. Some estimates are that the U.S. could reach 100% clean electricity with roughly 1.1 TW of wind and solar combined.
And because an additional 25% to 40% of existing electricity generation would electrify 100% of our transportation sector, 2 TW of solar would generate roughly double what’s needed to fully electrify U.S. transportation.
That leads us to a startling conclusion. Solar fields are capable of producing roughly 16 times more transportation energy per acre than our current biofuel processes, while also providing a much needed opportunity to restore our native ecosystems.
