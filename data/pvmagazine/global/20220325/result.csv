Presently, cars take on average ten hours to fully recharge at home or 20-40 minutes using cutting-edge superchargers at a charging station. With slow charging times being one of the main issues in the way of EV adoption, South Korean researchers have looked into the realm of quantum physics. Their starting point was the concept of quantum battery first prosed in a 2012 study, which theorized that quantum resources, such as entanglement, can be used to vastly speed up the battery charging process by charging all cells within the battery collectively as a whole. In contrast, conventional battery cells are charged in parallel, independently of one another, slowing down the process. The IBS scientists found that the presence of global operation, where all cells talk simultaneously, is the single main factor in the quantum charging advantage that leads to quadratic scaling in charging speed. This means that as quantum batteries increase in size, charging time becomes faster. To put it in numbers, employing quantum charging with a battery that contains about 200 cells would cut the charging time to about three minutes at home or about nine seconds at a charging station.
But while quantum technologies are still in their infancy and there is still a long way to go before these methods can be implemented in practice, Israeli battery developer StoreDot has secured new funding aimed towards developing battery cells capable of delivering 100 miles (160 kilometers) in five minutes of charge by 2024. Following its partnerships with Daimler, BP, Samsung, TDK, EVE, and VinFast, the Israeli startup has now secured a multi-million-dollar investment from India's EV manufacturer Ola Electric. The funding will be used for R&D and to accelerate the scaling up to mass production of its silicon-dominant anode extreme fast charging (XFC) lithium-ion cells. After achieving a world first in 2019 by demonstrating the live full charge of a two-wheeled EV in five minutes, StoreDot is now moving XFC battery technology from the lab to a commercially-viable product, making it available in both pouch and the 4680-family form factor. According to its strategic technology roadmap unveiled earlier this month, StoreDot gears to deliver three generations of its battery technology – described as 100in5, 100in3, and 100in2 of miles per minute of charging – by 2024, 2028 and 2030. StoreDot claims that it is already at the “advanced stages of developing ground-breaking semi-solid-state technologies” which it believes will further improve its batteries by 40% over the next four years. Its third-generation achievement is expected to come on the back of a post-lithium technology that is to offer an energy density of more than 550 Wh/kg.
In other news this week, Ola Electric has emerged as one of the winners in a 50GWh battery cell tender under PLI Scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage. The EV manufacturer has secured incentive support for a 20GWh cell manufacturing facility, alongside Hyundai Global Motors (20GWh), Reliance New Energy Solar (5GWh), and Rajesh Exports (5GWh). The selected bidders will have to set up the manufacturing facility within two years from the appointed date. The incentive will be disbursed thereafter over a period of five years on the sale of batteries manufactured in India. The tender announcement comes hot on the heels of Japanese carmaker Suzuki Motor‘s decision to invest $1.3 billion in electric car and battery manufacturing in India, further boosting the country's nascent EV sector.
Talking about big manufacturing plans, Stellantis and LG Chem's LG Energy Solution (LGES) have announced an over CAD$5 billion ($4.1 billion) investment in a battery gigafactory in Canada. The joint venture will be the first large-scale lithium-ion battery cell and module production plant in Canada, with an annual production capacity in excess of 45GWh. The production plant will be located in Winstor, Ontario, and its construction is scheduled to begin later this year and see batteries rolling off the production lines in the first quarter of 2024. In a separate announcement, the South Korean battery manufacturer has announced a KRW 1.7 trillion ($1.39 billion) investment in a new factory for cylindrical lithium-ion batteries in Queen Creek, Arizona. The facility will be LGES' first-ever cylindrical-type battery manufacturing plant in North America and also a wholly-owned subsidiary, rather than a joint venture.
Over in Europe, LGES' manufacturing plans are shaping well with the European Commission (EC) approving a plan by the Polish government to contribute €95 million to the cost of expanding lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing capacity at a Polish site owned by the South Korean company. The manufacturer announced plans to invest €1 billion at its Biskupice Podgórne cell and battery module and pack plant, in the Dolnośląskie region of southwest Poland, in 2017. In other news, the EC on Tuesday approved the grant of €209 million of public support to Korean-owned SK On Hungary to help finance an EV battery cell and module factory in Hungary. The plant project, started early last year, will see the manufacturer – part of the SK Group conglomerate – invest €1.62 billion into a fab with an annual production capacity of 30GWh at Iváncsa, in the Közép-Dunántúl region which qualifies for EU regional aid. The commission said the factory – which will create at least 1,900 jobs – would have been built in a more developed part of the EU without the Hungarian government cash.
German automaker Volkswagen said that it would restart vehicle production at its German EV factories slightly ahead of its original plans. In late February, the company pointed to Ukraine supply chain issues as a reason for halting production in Germany, and is now gearing to resume production next week. The announcement comes just days after German cable and harness maker Leoni, which supplies automakers with wire harnesses crucial for car production, has returned to producing at 40% capacity in Ukraine after a temporary halt due to Russia’s invasion. In other news, Volkswagen has confirmed plans for its next battery cell factory in Spain. The automaker will invest EUR 7 billion on electrifying Spanish production, with the investment hanging on receiving government funds. US carmaker Ford could join VW's Spanish project as a customer or partner.
Japanese carmakers are also eyeing the European EV market. Following its decision to not invest in Euro 7 for passenger cars, Nissan will not introduce any new pure internal combustion engine-powered passenger cars in Europe from 2023. The carmaker expects 75% of its sales mix in the region to be electrified by FY2026, with the ambition to reach 100% by the end of the decade. Honda is gearing to claim its market share following the launch of its Civic:e in Europe. The hybrid is another step towards Honda's goal to electrify its entire European lineup this year.
Finally, China’s battery maker BYD and the Dutch energy company Shell have partnered to develop new EV charging offers for clients in China and Europe. Initially, the two firms will develop a network of more than 10,000 charging points in Shenzhen, before extending to other regions. BYD’s battery-powered EVs and plug-in hybrids will also be allowed to access 275,000 charging points across Shell’s network in Europe. Shell hopes to operate over 500,000 EV charging points worldwide by 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/25/hyundai-sonata-hybrid-is-equipped-with-a-solar-roof/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 25, 2022",Hyundai Sonata hybrid is equipped with a solar roof,"From pv magazine USA
The newest model of the Hyundai Sonata hybrid is equipped with a 205W solar PV array that directly charges the car’s battery. It is estimated the PV will add about 2.5 miles of range per day. The solar panels feature 22.8% efficiency.
While this number may not jump off the page as impressive, the solar PV marks an improvement in efficiency for the vehicle that can add up to being significant. Two and a half miles per day for a year comes out to 912.5 “free” miles. Based on an average commuter’s yearly mileage of 10,000 miles, this represents an over 9% improvement to fuel efficiency.
Hyundai said its solar array system comes with efficient design advantages over competitor cars like the solar-roofed Toyota Prius. The Prius has a separate solar battery, requiring two stages of conversions to charge the high voltage driving battery and the auxiliary “starter” battery. The Sonata only converts once, directly feeding power through the panels, to a maximum power point tracker charge controller, and directly into the auxiliary batteries and drive batteries. This leads to more efficient use of photovoltaic generation, said Hyundai.
The automaker said that the solar roof lessens the burden on the engine and prevents battery discharge. The Korea Insurance Development Institute estimates 4 out of 10 emergency on-road services relate to battery discharge, as parked car electrical systems require an average of about 720mAh per day, and black box cameras, which are increasingly being integrated in cars, require an additional 12,000mAh. With the solar roof, one hour of charging can provide 14,000mAh, supplying a car’s powered-off battery needs for the whole day.
While the range added by the PV is not dramatic, efficiency improvements are just that – improvements. Hyundai does not attempt to “greenwash” the product and recognizes that this is not the core of the vehicle’s power, but rather an ancillary system that provides a handful of benefits.
The solar roof-integrated “Limited” trim for the Sonata is rated at 47 miles per gallon and has a 192 horsepower engine. It has autonomous features like remote parking assist, highway driving assist, and has cameras for blind-spot views. Through an app, drivers can access the Sonata using their mobile phone as a key.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/25/developing-better-behind-the-meter-energy-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 25, 2022",Developing better behind-the-meter energy storage,"From pv magazine USA
Behind-the-meter storage (BTMS) systems directly supply homes and buildings with electricity and offer many advantages such as the ability to minimize grid impacts, integrate EV charging, and more.
The BTMS markets are expected to see strong growth, as noted in Wood Mackenzie’s Global Energy Storage Outlook, which forecasts 57GWh of new deployments through to 2030. The report points out that the residential sector is being driven by cost reductions and consumer awareness, coupled with solar hybridization and electric vehicle adoption.
Researchers in the BTMS Consortium at the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) are working with other national laboratories to develop energy storage technologies for stationary applications below 10MWh. Their recent work, which aims to improve lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery designs is published in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society, delved further into promising opportunities, as well as limitations, of using LTO/LMO battery cells for stationary storage use.
“We already know a lot about Lithium-ion batteries, but batteries for different applications have different requirements,” said NREL Researcher and Project Leader Yeyoung Ha. “Our research looks at how to leverage the developments from electric vehicle battery research for new applications in stationary storage.”
According to the researchers, BTMS systems have different charging and discharging patterns than a typical electric vehicle and require Li-ion battery materials that meet these unique priorities. BTMS systems, for example, are expected to operate safely and efficiently over a long lifespan. The researchers looked at Li-ion battery designs using a Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) anode and LiMn2O4 (LMO) cathode, which are promising critical-material-free candidates that offer the safety and long lifespan required, however, their low energy density is a drawback.
NREL researchers evaluated the temperature-dependent performance of LTO/LMO cells with various electrode loadings, and they determined that using thicker electrodes in battery designs can increase the cell capacity and energy density, while decreasing overall cell costs. However, these thicker electrodes require ions to travel a longer path, limiting the use of electrodes. They found that temperature adjustments can alleviate these negative impacts but may introduce added complications.
“Our goal with this research is to identify a ‘sweet spot’ to leverage the advantages of electrode loading and increased temperatures to maximize the performance of LTO/LMO battery cells,” Ha said. “Our research refined material designs for BTMS specifically, converting this well-known power chemistry to energy cells.”
By applying electrochemical modeling to simulate reactions at different temperatures and electrode thickness, they verified their experimental results. Instead fully discharging the batteries, as for electric vehicles, they found that allowing batteries to have intermittent rest during discharge, the electrode use was significantly improved. And they determined that this type of pulsed discharge is well suited for BTMS stationary applications, where the batteries will be used only when there is intermittent demand and then transitioned back to a resting stage.
Although these optimized LTO/LMO battery cells offer many advantages, the research team is also exploring cathode options that may better meet the needs of the stationary energy storage systems that are critical to ensuring that the power from renewable energy sources is available when and where it is needed.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/25/the-hydrogen-stream-new-tech-to-convert-hydrogen-into-methanol-for-transportation/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"MARCH 25, 2022",The Hydrogen Stream: New tech to convert hydrogen into methanol for transportation,"Researchers at the German research institute Fraunhofer IMM are developing methanol reformers that can overcome challenges like catalyst attrition and space demand. The reformers reportedly need around 17% of the space that a comparable performance class conventional reformer would require. “We are opting for catalyst coatings containing precious metals similar to those used in automotive catalytic converters, because there is no attrition with these coatings,” commented Gunther Kolb, Deputy Institute Director and Division Director at Fraunhofer IMM. “Less catalyst material is required as a result. Because our catalyst materials also have a higher activity, the amount of catalyst required is reduced even further, and consequently the costs.” In the press release published earlier this month, Fraunhofer IMM said that its catalyst does not produce by-products such as carbon monoxide when operated at partial load. The idea behind, as explained by Fraunhofer IMM, is that hydrogen should be converted into methanol for transportation. The methanol should then be converted back into hydrogen and carbon dioxide for final consumption.
China presented on Mar. 23 its first long-term plan for hydrogen, targeting production of green hydrogen between 100,000 and 200,000 tonnes per year by 2025. “By 2025, a relatively complete system and policy environment for the development of the hydrogen energy industry will be formed, the industrial innovation capability will be significantly improved, the core technologies and manufacturing processes will be basically mastered, and a relatively complete supply chain and industrial system will be initially established,” reads the NDRC communication, adding that hydrogen is “strategic”. Innovation leads, self-reliance, and self-improvement are the three main drivers of the strategy to address the country's hydrogen energy industry weaknesses. According to the communication, the hydrogen sector “is still in the early stage of development, compared with the international advanced hydrogen industry.”
India and Japan have agreed to expand the scope of their energy collaboration to cover solar power, clean hydrogen, electric vehicles, and battery storage. The decision was taken during a recent three-day visit to India by Prime Minister of Japan, Kishida Fumio. Meanwhile, National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI) has launched the Green Hydrogen Consortium of Indian Industry (GHCII) in partnership with the Hydrogen Association of India (HAI).
In its new strategic plan for 2025, Paris-based industrial gases company Air Liquide said it would increase research investments in five new markets, the first being hydrogen mobility and notably heavy-duty mobility. The plan aims “to at least triple its turnover in order to reach more than 6 billion euros by 2035”, while bringing its total electrolysis capacity to 3GW by 2030. The company committed to an €8 billion investment in the low-carbon hydrogen supply chain by 2035.
UK-based energy storage and clean fuel company ITM Power has concluded a strategic partnership agreement with Vitol Holdings for wholly-owned subsidiary ITM Motive Limited, trading as Motive, to become a 50/50 joint-venture owned between ITM Power and Vitol. “As part of the transaction, Motive has entered into a framework agreement with ITM Power, under which Motive appoints ITM Power as its preferred supplier for up to 240MW of electrolysis equipment to support Motive with the development and roll-out of new green hydrogen refueling stations. Motive has also appointed Vitol as its preferred supplier for up to 240MW of electricity demand, which will provide green power to the network of new refueling stations,” ITM wrote on Wednesday.
German electrolyzer manufacturer Sunfire has raised a total of €86 million to expand its manufacturing capacity, specifically for its Series D. Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) and Blue Earth Capital are among the investors. Last October, the Dresden-based specialist for alkali and solid oxide technologies (SOEC) already raised €109 million euros, bringing the total amount raised in Series D to €195 million. CIP is also securing access to electrolysis capacities from Sunfire. The project developer plans to purchase pressurized alkali electrolyzers with a total capacity of up to 640MW in the coming years.
German utility RWE and the gas grid operator OGE want to create the backbone of a hydrogen infrastructure from the North Sea coast to southern Germany. They called the project H2ercules. The concept envisages setting up electrolyzers as well as storage and import facilities for green hydrogen in the north and connecting these with industrial end-users in the west and south of Germany. Other import routes under development from the south and east are to be commissioned by 2030. RWE and OGE put the investment requirement at around €3.5 billion. H2ercules could meet two-thirds of the hydrogen demand expected for 2030 in consumption centers along the recommended corridor, the two companies expect.
German power company Steag and thyssenkrupp signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the supply of thyssenkrupp Steel’s site in Duisburg with hydrogen and oxygen from the neighboring STEAG site in Walsum. “The investment decision for the scenario considered as the most robust, a water electrolysis plant with an installed capacity of up to 520 MW at the Walsum site, is to be made by 2023 at the latest,” the two companies wrote earlier this week. 
The North Netherlands Cooperation Agency awarded a €3.5 million subsidy for the WAviatER project to develop green hydrogen technology from the European Regional Development Fund (EFRO). Consortium partners are Douna Machinery Leeuwarden, JB Besturingstechniek, REDStack, Demcon, Groningen Airport Eelde, New Energy Coalition and the University of Groningen, supported by TNO and VONK. The first concrete application is at Groningen Airport Eelde, where an electrolyzer will produce green hydrogen for light aircraft, drones and ground equipment. “In the Northern Netherlands, this is the first step towards an ecosystem of companies developing their own products for the green hydrogen economy,” said the companies, underlining how partnerships can develop business models and ecosystems to increase hydrogen demand.
New York has signed a multi-state agreement, including with an initial group of 40 hydrogen ecosystem partners, to develop a proposal to become one of at least four regional clean energy hydrogen hubs designated through the federal Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. “The New York-led consortium includes Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Jersey – longstanding leaders in hydrogen and fuel cell innovation, and key neighbors on the I-95 corridor – as the first out-of-state partners to join the regional effort, opening the door for future state additions,” the office of the governor wrote on Thursday.
Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria announced on Friday a tri-state collaboration on a renewable hydrogen refueling network for heavy transport and logistics along Australia’s eastern seaboard. “Under the Memorandum of Understanding, the States have agreed to collaborate on the development of the east coast hydrogen refuelling network that includes the nation’s most critical roads and highways,” the Queensland Cabinet wrote.
Australia-based Aviation H2 expects the construction of its first hydrogen-fuelled prototype to begin soon. The company said in an email statement that it has completed the research stage and will soon start modifying turbofan engines to test and prove the concept. The company expects “Australia’s first hydrogen-powered aircraft” to be in the skies midway through 2023. “The results from our analysis have been very positive. We now have a pathway outlined towards building a hydrogen-fuelled plane that will be both efficient and commercially viable,” said Aviation H2 Director, Helmut Mayer.
Australian companies Pure Hydrogen and JJ Waste & Recycling say their partnership will see the hydrogen-powered garbage trucks hit the streets of Queensland’s southeast before the end of the year. On Monday, Pure Hydrogen announced its Binding Term Sheet with JJ Waste. The agreement will see the parties enter a “wet hire lease agreement” with Pure Hydrogen supplying the hydrogen-fuelled garbage truck, hydrogen, and refueling services.

The cap price for PV technology was set at PHP3.628 ($0.069)/kWh, while that for wind power was assigned a ceiling rate of PHP5.2887.
Furthermore, the authority said that the offered price for biomass and run-of-river hydro projects must not exceed PHP5.548 and PHP5.8705/kWh, respectively.
In a specific document, the ERC explained that the cap price for solar was established considering an installed capacity of 100MW and installations costs of $864.1 per kW installed. The modeling also considered a 25-year lifetime of the facility and a construction time of 24 months.
Moreover, the regulator assumed the plant will sell power through a 20-year power purchase agreement and will have a net capacity factor of 21.3%. O&M costs were estimated at around $482,743.12 per year. The global levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of large scale solar was estimated at around PHP2.8075 ($0.053)/kWh.
Through the upcoming procurement exercise, the country's authorities want to contract 1,260MW of PV, 380MW of wind power, 230MW of biomass, and 130MW of hydropower capacity.
As for PV technology, around 900MW should be assigned to the Luzon province, while the provinces of Visayas and Mindanao are expected to be awarded 260 and 100MW, respectively.

“Due to hostilities transmission grid lines are often being damaged or completely destroyed, Oleksandr Kozakevych, chairman of the Ukraine Association of Renewable Energy told pv magazine. “Despite workers of transmission system operator Ukrenergo bravely and quickly fixing them, often risking their own lives, many critical infrastructures are left without electricity supply,” Kozakevych said, explaining that in these conditions solar power is ensuring a smooth operation of important energy infrastructure.
The Ukrainian gas transmission system operator announced plans to install solar panels at gas distribution stations to save energy in 2021. Given last year's rise in electricity prices in Europe and Ukraine, the installation of solar panels and batteries at gas distribution stations for their own consumption would save costs, the operator explained.
This decision reflected the growing popularity of solar power in Ukraine over the past few years. In 2021 Ukrainian companies started to install more solar panels on their sites – on roofs and facades – and generate electricity for their own consumption without selling it to the grid at feed-in-tariff. “The war only confirms the importance of further active development of renewable energy sources (RES). It is independence from resources, safety for the environment and the health of citizens, and small distributed generation provides energy if grid lines are damaged,” Kozakevych said.
The Ukraine Association of Renewable Energy recently reported that shelling by the Russian army damaged equipment and panels at solar stations in all regions where hostilities are taking place. Kozakevych said that some stations are occupied, personnel does not have access to them, while enemy equipment is placed on their territory using the stations as a cover from the attack of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. “In addition to the physical damage of the power plant, the owners of solar power plants are experiencing financial difficulties. As to electricity consumption fall, renewable energy sources operate with constant curtailments,” he said.
“Some solar plants have been operating for only 1-3 days in the last 2 weeks,” Kozakevych said, adding that as Ukraine's Energy System synchronized with ENTSO-E since Mar. 16, launching electricity trade with EU countries would help to reduce the number of RES curtailments.
The Ukraine government is currently considering issuing financial support to solar power plants in the country, to help them in these difficult times. The Ukraine Energy Ministry has issued an order stating that all proceeds, including from the sale of electricity produced from renewable energy, are used to repay debts accumulated in 2020 to Ukraine nuclear plant operator Energoatom of UAH 4 billion (€122 million).
“Work is currently underway to amend this order the main purpose of which is to determine the required level of payments to renewable energy producers. The rest of the proceeds will be sent to Energoatom,” Kozakevych said.
“In this regard, representatives of the renewable energy industry, realizing the difficult situation in Ukraine's energy sector, appealed to the Cabinet of Ministers, the National Commission for Energy Regulation, and the Ministry of Energy with a proposal to set the level of payment for electricity from renewables at least 20% of the feed-in-tariff,” he added.
However, the proposals by the National Commission for Regulation of Economic Competition on the required level of payments were set at 16% of the feed-in-tariff for wind power plants, 15% for solar power plants. “Such a level of feed-in-tariff is insufficient to cover the operating costs of SPP, especially for small solar plants, and in the state of constant curtailments of generation, which cumulatively reach up to 50% of the projected electricity production volume,” Kozakevych said.

The pavement was built with a transparent resin-concrete material made with waste glass and unsaturated polyester resin, with the latter being used as cementing material, as well as a curing agent and accelerator. “The transparent resin-concrete completely encapsulates the solar panel module, forming a whole and increasing the stability of the structure,” the scientists claimed, referring to the mechanical stress that pavement PV systems have to endure when they come in contact with vehicles or persons.
The system was equipped with built-in amorphous silicon solar modules. The modules are built with 130x120mm solar cells and have a size of 150x150x2mm. Their rated power is 3W and the power conversion efficiency reaches 15.51%. The resin pouring body has an irradiance ratio of 88.3%, a brightness ratio of 88.2%, and an open-circuit ratio of 97.5%.
The compressive strength of the 100×100×25mm prototype was measured using a microcomputer-controlled electro-hydraulic servo pressure-testing machine and its optical properties were measured in a dark room.

The daily power generation of the solar pavement module was found to be 0.152 kWh/m2, which is about 16.28% of the original solar panel. The scientists specified that the low power-generation efficiency of the solar pavement module was due to the low solar irradiance of the testing location in Changsha, Central China, in November, as well as to the loss of light caused by the reflection of the module surface, the light loss through the transparent resin-concrete, and the heat released during resin curing, which may have had some effect on the solar panel.
“To improve the power-generation efficiency of the solar pavement module, solar panels with high conversion efficiency such as a combination of plexiglass, transparent silicone resin, and monocrystalline silicon should be used,” the scientists further explained. “In addition, because the output power of the solar panels varies with the changing irradiance, in areas with large irradiance and annual sunshine such as Tibet, Xinjiang, China, power generation will be more efficient.”
The proposed system is said to achieve a levelized cost of energy of $0.175/kWh, which is claimed to make the solar pavement cost-effective compared to other types of solar pavement. “Although the investment cost of transparent resin-concrete solar pavement is higher than cement pavement and asphalt pavement in the early stage, its intangible economic, environmental influences and social benefits are considerable in the long run,” the academics concluded.
Their findings were presented in the study Preparation and performance study of solar pavement panel based on transparent Resin-Concrete, published in Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments.

The new measure will come into force on April 1, 2022. “The zero-rate will be available for a period of 5 years and will then revert to the 5% reduced rate of VAT,” the government said in a statement. “This measure will positively impact individuals through lower prices charged by energy-saving materials (ESMs) installers, subject to the degree to which these businesses pass the VAT savings on to their customers.”
Wind and water turbines were also added back to the list of the ESMs eligible for the VAT reduction.
“Solar Energy UK is delighted to see VAT reduced on solar and other energy saving materials for residential use, after many years of calling for this,” said the association's CEO, Chris Hewett. “It is common sense for the Treasury to be encouraging greater uptake of all zero carbon technologies in the face of an energy security crisis and climate emergency. It will be seen as a real endorsement of solar, as well as improving the pay back for many consumers who may be on the fence.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/25/two-layer-phase-change-materials-for-solar-module-cooling/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,IRAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 25, 2022",Two-layer phase change materials for solar module cooling,"A group of scientists in Iran has considered using a two-layer phase change material (PCM) as a passive cooling agent for a cooling system for photovoltaic panels. PCMs are able to absorb, store and release large amounts of latent heat over a defined temperature range and have often been used, at the research level, for PV module cooling.
“We have conducted the numerical study based on a commercial PV module, and proposed a cooling system using the benchmark studies in the literature, so we have not designed and implemented a pilot experimental setup yet,” the research's corresponding author, Mohammad Adib, told pv magazine. “We are now working with the Niroo Research Institute (NRI) to outline a roadmap for its commercial viability.”
The 2D numerical simulation considered a solar module-integrated two-layer PCM cooling unit that controls the panel temperature by absorbing its excess heat. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology was utilized to assess the performance of the integrated device in four different climate conditions in Iran. A Net Present Worth (NPW) technique was used to calculate the present value based on the interest rate, operating costs, and power yield of the system.
“Since the PCM cooling needs no significant maintenance and repair, operating costs can be safely neglected,” the researchers stated. “Therefore, only initial investment is considered for the economic analysis. The benefit results from selling the extra electrical energy produced by the PCM-integrated PV module compared with the no-PCM module. In addition, energy savings due to hot water storage has also been taken into account in benefit calculations.”
The system was assumed to be fabricated with four different organic PCMs – RT25HC, RT28HC, RT35HC, and RT44HC – which are all products of German PCM provider Rubitherm Technologies GmbH. Twelve different combinations of compartment thicknesses and PCM material were taken into account. A solar module JAP60S09-275/SC with a power output of 275W and a 16.7% efficiency from Chinese manufacturer JA Solar was chosen for the simulation.
The best performing system configuration was found to be at the location with the hottest and dryest climate, for which a 3.11% increase in annual power yield was registered. This location also offered the highest water temperature of 48 Celsius degrees produced by the system's excees heat.
The research group found that, at the current stage, the proposed cooling approach is not economically justifiable, due to the high initial costs of PCM materials. The payback period was demonstrated for different interest rates and was found to be of 26 years assuming a 10% interest rate.
The cooling technique was introduced in the paper Techno-economic assessment of a photovoltaic module integrated with a two-layer phase change material unit, published in the Journal of Energy Storage. The research group included scientists from the Niroo Research Institute (NRI), the University of Tehran, and the Amirkabir University of Technology in Iran. “The operational lifespan of PV modules is normally
20 years, but can be extended to 48 years by using a PCM cooling system,” they concluded.

Pico-hydro systems are all hydropower systems with a capacity of less than 5kW and are commonly used as a cheap and easy-to-deploy source of power in the world’s most inaccessible places.
“The system can also be used in combination with photovoltaics and batteries to ensure stable power supply, ” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “Depending on the amount of electricity generated, it can be used for IoT devices such as sensors, lighting devices, and charging systems. A 1kW hydroelectric power generator is under development and is the output we are aiming for in the future, currently, it is a few watts or a few dozen watts.”
Called 3D-Pico Hydro Generator System, the new product will be initially sold in the Japanese market. “Service validation will begin in Japan, and the system will gradually be offered globally to markets where it is needed,” the spokesperson further explained.

According to the manufacturer, the system is made with 3D-printed sustainable materials based on recycled plastics and is able to generate electricity even with a small stream of water.
It was tested at the company's Numazu Plant. “In our demonstration experiment using factory wastewater from the Ricoh Numazu Plant, we confirmed the possibility of lighting a lamp and using it as a power source for a security camera for nine months,” the company said. “We are also considering using it as a power source for disaster prevention in combination with battery storage.”
“Ricoh is also planning to improve the system so that it can also be used in microgrids,” the company's spokesperson concluded.
There are many factors that determine the feasibility of a mini-hydropower project. These include the amount of power available from the water flow, the turbine type, the capacity of electrical loads to be supplied, and the initial and operating costs.
During the past decades, Pico-hydropower systems have been used with success in countries such as Nepal, Vietnam, Laos and Peru, as a way to provide electricity to rural locations.
*The article was updated on March 31 to specify that 1kW is the capacity Ricoh is aiming to reach for the system in the future, and not its current capacity, as we previously reported.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/25/energy-storage-installations-set-new-records-in-the-u-s-despite-supply-chain-issues/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MARCH 25, 2022",Energy storage installations set new records in the U.S. despite supply chain issues,"From pv magazine USA
Despite not quite hitting the numbers anticipated, the US energy storage market set a new record in the fourth quarter of 2021, with new system installations totaling 4,727MWh, according to Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association’s (ACP) latest US Energy Storage Monitor report, released today.
And it could have been so much more. Due to supply chain challenges, over 2GW of grid-scale capacity originally slated to come online in Q4 2021 were delayed to 2022 and 2023.

Grid-scale 
Annual deployments of grid-scale storage nearly tripled year-over-year to 3GW / 9.2GWh. An additional 770MW of late-stage capacity that was previously delayed is expected to come online, positioning Q1 2022 to deliver up to 1.7GW of capacity. These projects saw impressive deployments in certain Southern states, as well as from traditional market leaders this quarter such as California and Texas, where projects have an average duration of around three hours. Wood Mackenzie forecasts that supply chain pressures and interconnection-related delays will persist through 2024.
Projects are still being built at record-setting pace remain on track for exponential growth, despite supply chain and pricing issues. Module and BOS prices have caused some projects to be delayed while developers wait for Capex to stabilize.
Residential
Residential storage had its strongest quarter to date with 123MW installed, (the previous quarterly record was 110MW in Q1 2021). Despite limited battery supply, the segment still managed to grow 85% between 2020 and 2021 in MWh terms, and this is in part due to solar-plus-storage sales in markets outside of California. The national annual total of installed residential energy storage amounted to 436MW.
By 2026, annual installations in the residential segment are expected to hit 2GW / 5.4GWh, with California, Puerto Rico, Texas, and Florida leading the way. The residential forecast assumes that the NEM 3.0 proposed decision in California will go into effect as written, although WoodMac analysts said that this is not a certain outcome. If it does not, the forecast would be reduced ~5% annually from 2023.
“2021 was yet another record for the U.S. energy storage market, with annual installations of multiple gigawatts for the first time,” said Jason Burwen, Vice President for Energy Storage at American Clean Power. “Even in the face of continued macro-economic headwinds, interconnection delays, and lack of proactive federal policy, increasing demand for resilient clean energy and volatility in the price of fuel-based generation will drive energy storage deployment forward.”
Non-residential
The non-residential storage segment delivered 131MWh in the fourth quarter resulting in 162MW / 350MWh of total annual deployments in 2021. Segment demand was driven by increased storage attachment rates within the community solar markets of New York and Massachusetts. The non-residential/community solar market is forecast to near 1GW annually in 2026.
Costs
Higher costs for raw materials and transportation have undercut system component price gains experienced over recent years. Specifically, the increased cost of raw materials resulted in battery module prices increase the most among all system components. Increased standardization has helped hold BOS steady,  with few system components increasing, such as inverters and GSU.
The report found that despite policy uncertainty, the California storage market remains resilient, and by 2027, California is forecast to remain the largest residential storage market, with three-and-a-half times more storage installed annually in 2027 compared to 2021. Puerto Rico is also a strong market, as solar-plus-storage is embraced as a defense against the widescale power outages experienced in recent weather events.
“Puerto Rico’s position in the residential US solar-plus-storage market comes as no surprise, and demonstrates how outages can drive battery adoption, with thousands of new residential installs emerging each quarter and competition increasing between local installers,” said Chloe Holden, an analyst with Wood Mackenzie’s energy storage team.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/25/australians-agl-builds-storage-portfolio/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 25, 2022",Australia’s AGL builds storage portfolio,"From pv magazine Australia
AGL has reached a final investment decision (FID) of $41 million with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to build a 50MW large-scale battery with one hour of storage that will help to improve the reliability of energy supply in Broken Hill, as well as providing storage and firming capacity to the National Energy Market (NEM).
ARENA confirmed on Friday it will provide a $14.84 million grant to enable the construction of the 50MW/50MWh lithium-ion battery which will be equipped with advanced inverter technology designed to improve system strength and support increased levels of renewable energy generation in the area.
AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said the project is another step forward for the energy utility which has ambitions to become “a leading orchestrator of batteries in Australia”.
“As Australia moves forward with its energy transition, we know that firming technologies like batteries play an important role in energy storage and supporting renewable energy supply,” he said.
“Broken Hill’s unique edge-of-grid environment provides an ideal location for this advanced inverter technology to demonstrate how it can facilitate further penetration of renewable energy generation and add to the stability of the wider electricity network.”
AGL has engaged energy storage provider Fluence and its consortium partner Valmec to supply the battery for the Broken Hill project which has been designed to be compatible with the 53MW Broken Hill Solar Farm and the nearby 200MW Silverton Wind Farm, both of which AGL operates.
ARENA chief executive Darren Miller said he expects the Broken Hill battery to demonstrate the ability of large-scale batteries to be equipped with grid-forming inverters to improve system strength and facilitate higher penetrations of variable renewable energy generation at the lowest cost.
“Big batteries are already becoming critical to our electricity system, but we know with grid-forming inverters they can provide system strength services traditionally provided by thermal generation,” he said.
“We are particularly interested in seeing how AGL’s Broken Hill battery will utilize and demonstrate advanced inverter technology in a weaker section of the energy grid.”
Fluence Australia general manager Aaron McCann said the Broken Hill battery, the first project the company is delivering to AGL after signing a framework agreement in 2021 to supply up to 1GW of grid-scale battery storage, will offer “market-leading functionality with advanced grid-forming inverters”.

The battery is expected to benefit AGL’s Broken Hill Solar Farm. The project, which will use Fluence’s Gridstack product, will start and remain in grid-forming mode with all inverters operating as a voltage source. The company said the system will inherently resist changes in voltage and frequency on the grid and provide synthetic inertia.
“Broken Hill battery’s full power occurs instantaneously to quickly respond to large changes in voltage and or frequency, which is the fastest response of all battery energy storage systems currently available in the market,” McCann said.
The Broken Hill battery is to be built on industrial land about six kilometers southeast of the city center. The project, which will connect to TransGrid’s Broken Hill substation, is expected to be completed by early 2023.
The final investment decision for the Broken Hill project comes just days after AGL secured planning approval for a 500MW/2GWh grid-connected utility scale battery to be developed at the site of its coal-fired Liddell power plant in the NSW Hunter Valley.
The projects are part of the power producer’s plan to establish a large-scale battery storage portfolio. The energy giant has already commenced construction of a 250MW/1GWh battery at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia, has unveiled plans to build a large-scale battery at Loy Yang A power station in Victoria (200MW/800MWh), and has announced support for battery projects at Wandoan (100MW) in Queensland and Maoneng (4 x 50MW) in NSW. It is already operating the 30 MW/8MWh BESS at Dalrymple in South Australia.
