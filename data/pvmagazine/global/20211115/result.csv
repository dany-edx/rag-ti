Among these are mesoporous carbon perovskite solar cells (m-CPSMs), comprising a titanium-oxide spacer layer, and zirconium/graphite layers deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass. These are a little way behind the highest efficiencies achieved with perovskites, but have shown strong potential for stability thanks to the thick graphite layers that help to prevent both moisture ingress and light-induced degradation.
A 2017 study carried out by École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) found that m-CPSMs could be stable for more than 10,000 hours under ‘one sun’ illumination. This study also noted an initial increase in the cells’ efficiency under illumination – and another group of researchers led by Japan’s University of Hyogo set out to understand the mechanisms behind this, and how it might affect cells in outdoor, day and night conditions, rather than under constant illumination.
Their work, Light-induced performance increase of carbon-based perovskite solar module for 20-year stability, is published in Cell Reports Physical Science. The group was able to fabricate cells that stood up to 3,000 hours of damp heat testing – at 85 degrees Celsius and 85% humidity – and retained 92% of their initial performance. The cells still retained 90% of their initial performance after 3,260 hours, which the group calculates is equivalent to 20 years installed in outdoor conditions.
The cells’ impressive stability was attributed to a reversible light-induced performance increase, involving a reaction between methylammonium – a major component of the perovskite layer, and another organic additive to the materials known as 5-AVAI (5-ammoniumvaleric acid iodide), which was shown to improve charge transport and ion migration in the material.
This increased the efficiency by 1.4% (absolute) within 10 minutes, and led to a relative increase of 16% after 100 hours illumination. The effect is also shown to be reversible, with the cell returning to its initial efficiency when stored in the dark, and increasing again even when placed under low-light conditions.
The group further noted that it used ‘industry compatible’ processes to produce the cells, and expected the light soaking effect to apply similarly to large-scale devices. “This gain should be taken into account for market value and the design architecture of the system used in the devices,” they state. “In addition, the LS techniques presented can allow accurate evaluation and stable operation as well as increased performance, so that these findings will lead to research directed toward practical application of perovskite PVs.”

With Solar Philippines having announced, earlier this month, it plans an initial public offering (IPO) of the project company associated with the PV park, an update published by the developer on Saturday stated the first PHP1.3 billion ($26.1 million) raised by the exercise will be used to raise a quarter of the investment needed to install the first, 225 MW phase of the development.
With that first phase, therefore, set to cost around PHP5.2 billion, Solar Philippines told pv magazine an initial 50 MW of generation capacity will be installed on the former ranch land in the province of Nueva Ecija, before the borrowings of around PHP3.9 billion are drawn down.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
The developer on Saturday said any IPO proceeds above PHP1.3 billion would be spent acquiring land with the eventual aim of expanding the project size beyond 500 MW.
Solar Philippines at the weekend stuck to its previously stated target of aiming to begin construction this year. Having said, a fortnight ago, it intended to have an unspecified volume of solar capacity operational next year, that reference may have been to the first 50 MW of panels. The company had previously spoken of plans for an initial 225 MW phase, to be expanded with “further financing” to 500 MW and then “even beyond this capacity.”
The developer's Solar Philippines Nueva Ecija Corporation project company will offer up to 2.7 billion shares to investors from December 1-7, for an estimated PHP1 per share ($0.02), although the final offer price is due to be set on Tuesday next week.
Solar Philippines said the project company has been tentatively penciled in for a listing on the main board of the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) from December 17.
Leandro Leviste, founder of the Makati City-based solar company, quoted in Saturday's press release, said: “We thank the PSE and SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] for approving this IPO, which aims to give the public a new option to invest in RE [renewable energy] and increase the RE capacity of the Philippines.
“We’ve decided to make this our group’s first venture into the public markets because this is the asset that we are proudest to showcase: a site where will rise the largest solar project in southeast Asia, with potential for expansion given its proximity to Manila, to meet the growing demand for renewable energy in the Philippines.”
This copy was amended on 16/11/21 to include an explanation, provided by Solar Philippines, that the IPO plan always involved using a portion of the proceeds as the equity portion of a 75-25 debt-to-equity finance package for the first 225 MW of generation capacity at Peñaranda, with the developer intending to install the initial 50 MW before drawing down the debt needed for phase one.

The researchers said that polymer-based hydrophobic anti-soiling coatings have already been tested in solar modules. They said they only work in principle, as they cannot withstand constant exposure to environmental stress or to abrasion damage caused by regular cleaning.
The new solution consists of a thin abrasion-resistant inorganic coating fabricated via chemical vapour deposition (CVD), the research team said.
“The coating will be designed to ensure it is capable of being applied at an industrial scale using a chemical process that is compatible with glass manufacturing,” the team explained, without providing any additional technical details.
The U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) is providing the project with £1.2 million ($1.6 million) of funding. It is being developed in collaboration with University College London and the support of industrial partners such as U.K.-based PV drone specialist Above Surveying,Japanese glass manufacturer NSG Group, and Solar Farm Cleaning Ltd.
Several modules in production already include anti-reflective coatings to boost output. Dutch materials supplier DSM is in the process of launching a coating to be applied retroactively to older modules. Anti-soiling coatings are also gaining ground commercially, as project developers learn how to boost project output while keeping operations and maintenance costs to a minimum.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/15/greening-solar-supply-chains/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 15, 2021",Greening solar supply chains,"Renewable energy technologies fueled by wind and the sun are critical to addressing the climate crisis. However, many chemicals used in the production of solar and wind technologies are harmful to human health and the environment, scarce in supply, or sourced from countries that are unable to protect human rights. The notion of greening solar manufacturing isn’t new, but there is a renewed urgency surrounding it. This includes the reduction and management of chemicals of concern in PV manufacturing.
In 2020, the solar industry collaboratively finalized a roadmap of key sustainability metrics for the sector, creating NSF 457: Sustainability Leadership Standard for Photovoltaic Modules and Photovoltaic Inverters. This standard calls on companies to disclose and restrict the use of chemicals of high concern commonly used in the electronics sector such as those included on the International Electrotechnical Commission’s (IEC) 62474 material declaration list.
Going forward, this roadmap’s metrics will influence how companies conduct business in large portions of the world. Concurrent with ratcheting standards and regulations, the Clean Electronics Production Network (CEPN) recently launched the Toward Zero Exposure program, which facilitates and coordinates companies’ voluntary actions to protect workers from hazardous chemicals, helping them amplify their impact and stay ahead of regulation.
PV manufacturers are being required to meet performance benchmarks for material use in Type 1 Ecolabels like the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT), which are used by the European Union and the United States government in procurement preferences. Regulations like the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and RoHS have global implications on supply chains, product certifications, and public perception.
A company’s demonstrable commitment to eliminating chemicals of concern from manufacturing is becoming a key factor in investment decisions and access to capital and financing options, too. In 2019, investors representing over US$1.5 trillion in assets under management supported corporate engagement in the Silicon Valley Toxic Coalition’s (SVTC) Solar Scorecard. Leading solar companies like Jinko, Trina, and SunPower developed corporate sustainability programs with a strong focus on recycling and reducing waste.
For the past decade, investors working in partnership with the Solar Scorecard have leveraged best practices in the electronics sector for new key performance indicators in the solar sector. Investors are increasingly focused on supply chain transparency for the solar sector, asking companies to set clear goals and timelines for greening supply chains and improving worker health and safety.
Investors used the Scorecard to assess companies and promote a “race to the top” approach on broad-based sustainability metrics across market leaders. Banks are even using the Solar Scorecard to establish a baseline for financing solar developments: one European bank instituted a policy requiring solar companies to achieve a score of 80 or higher on the Solar Scorecard in order to qualify for loans.
Solar energy is built on an electronic platform dependent on similar materials of concern to other major technologies also under pressure from market drivers in the United States and Europe to use safer chemicals. In response, electronics industry leaders have created forward-looking chemical management programs that increase transparency on chemical use in the supply chain and drive safer substitution for chemicals.
These global conditions have created strong incentives for electronic leaders and major solar customers to seize the opportunity to create new pathways for collective action toward eliminating toxins from solar manufacturing. In response, the Clean Electronics Production Network (CEPN) recently launched Toward Zero Exposure with founding Signatories Apple, HP Inc., and Dell. Toward Zero Exposure is a commitment program that collectively addresses worker exposure to manufacturing process chemicals of concern used in electronic technologies. CEPN is inviting solar manufacturers to join as Signatories.
Toward Zero Exposure focuses on protecting workers from chemical hazards, with actions centered on the supply chain, where the greatest risk of chemical exposure exists for workers. The program was developed by CEPN’s multistakeholder collaborative network of NGOs such as Clean Production Action; major companies including Apple, Dell, Seagate, Cisco, Fairphone, Intel, and HP Inc.; government entities like the Environmental Protection Agency; and other labor, health and safety leaders such as the founder of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. The Responsible Business Alliance, which includes members like Tesla and First Solar, is also a member of CEPN and is working to bring CEPN’s supply chain management tools and resources into their network.
The program is a commitment to accelerate existing efforts in chemical safety and boost awareness of the need to improve chemical management practices across the global electronics manufacturing industry to eliminate workers’ exposure to hazardous chemicals. The program includes a commitment to eliminate or safely substitute nine priority processing chemicals, all of which are known to cause harm to human health, in key areas of each signatory’s supply chain.
By joining the Toward Zero Exposure program and pledging to address worker exposure, solar companies gain access to industry expertise and resources to fully support these transitions. The program provides comprehensive tools and protocols to manage chemical use in the supply chain, Green Screen assessments of safer solvents for cleaners and degreasers, as well as research and identification of safer alternatives that meet performance requirements. These are key ingredients to fast-tracking safer material innovation that builds on a decade of work electronics industry leaders have invested in through CEPN.
The Toward Zero Exposure program guides signatories through clear documentation on progress including benchmarks, milestones, and deadlines for program activities. Company actions are informed by a structured program with researched and pragmatic activities backed by the credibility of industry leaders and NGOs. By participating in the commitment program, companies join a structured forum to communicate and receive recognition for the work they do to protect workers from hazardous process chemicals.
Toward Zero Exposure Signatories pledge to take action in six areas:
This pledge represents an opportunity for the solar sector to meet growing customer and investor pressure calling for transparent and green supply chains, and to reduce costs from brand devaluation, fines, and litigation. Expectations of solar companies to align their brand with best practices in sustainability and authenticity continue to heighten, and participation in leadership initiatives addressing major industry-wide challenges – like chemical exposure – are becoming essential.
Solar industry growth is at its fastest in two decades. As companies scale up to meet increased demand, there’s an opportunity to put standards in place now that will remove toxic solvents from solar manufacturing moving forward. The renewable energy sector has long proven its ability to innovate quickly and make progress towards environmental and social benchmarks—this is the next logical and attainable step.

The Chilean government is planning to build a submarine cable to export photovoltaic energy to China, according to Chilean solar energy association – ACESOL – which cited a statement made by Chilean president, Sebastián Piñera, during the National Meeting of Entrepreneurs (ENADE).
Called Antípodas, the project is aimed at taking advantage of the huge solar potential of the Atacama Desert, which is the world's region with the highest solar radiation.
Piñera explained that, through the cable, the electricity produced by between 200 and 600 GW of photovoltaic generation capacity may transmit power to Asian countries when it is daytime in Chile and nighttime across the Pacific, or when it is winter in Asia and summer in the southern hemisphere.
“We have the deserts with the highest solar radiation in the world and a gigantic potential for generating clean, renewable and economic solar energy, which we can export during our day to supply Asian countries,” said Piñera.
The president clarified that the idea is particularly ambitious and thajust t to carry it out requires studies and strategic alliances with large Asian economies. The cable should be about 15,000km long and building a 1,300km cable would cost $2 billion. In addition, it would be necessary to invest in new solar plants since Chile has 3,106 MW of photovoltaic capacity installed, according to IRENA.
In Europe, British company Xlinks announced in the spring that it plans to build 10.5 GW of wind and solar power in Morocco and sell the power generated by the massive plant in the U.K. This would be possible thanks to a 3,800km, high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line. In total, Xlinks expected to invest about £18 billion ($24.1 billion).
In Asia, Sun Cable is leading a consortium that wants to build the Australia-ASEAN Power Link (AAPL) project, which would export solar energy from Australia’s Outback to Singapore via a submarine transmission link.

The General Court of the European Union on Wednesday rejected an attempt by Solar Electric Holding to force it to declare the regulation – introduced by the French state in 2000 to incentivize renewables – not incompatible with EU rules on state aid.
The court last week rejected an application, lodged in November last year by Solar Holding, which sought to annul a decision made by the commission in September 2020. The commission had decided the state aid complaint procedure used by Solar Holding to try and obtain confirmation from the commission the French FIT program was compatible with EU rules, was not intended for that purpose, but rather established to consider complaints seeking to set down in law the incompatibility of such incentive schemes with European legislation.
Pick up the latest edition of pv magazine to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyber attacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
The issue appears to be related to the French government's decision, in December, to retroactively reduce the FIT payments made to large scale solar projects under 20-year contracts awarded in the first three rounds of a national feed-in tariff program, in July 2006 and in January and August 2010.
The issue erupted in September 2019, when the French Court of Cassation judged payments based on the first two of those centrally-determined FIT levels, and above the market price for solar electricity, were unlawful because they had not been notified to the European Commission, as required under EU law. The commission confirmed that was the case in March 2020.
In June last year, Solar Holding said the lack of a decision by the commission about the compatibility of the FIT payments with EU law created “a legal vacuum detrimental to all French producers of electricity from photovoltaic energy sources.” Three months later – as rumors began to emerge the French government was preparing to reduce the payments made under the first three FIT levels set, to reduce public expense – an attempt by Solar Holdings to force the commission to determine the compatibility of the FIT program with the bloc's state aid rules was rebuffed, prompting the latest attempt made by the developer to reverse that decision.
In Wednesday's judgement, the general court stated the commission is only obliged to consider the compatibility of state aid schemes with the EU internal market in two situations: when such schemes are notified or when a complaint is made alleging their incompatibility. Neither of those conditions has been fulfilled, according to the commission and court.
The court backed the commission's assertion that, in the continued absence of notification of the scheme relating to the FIT payments in question, the tariffs should be considered unlawful and it was up to the member state concerned to recover any monies disbursed.
The FIT payments concerned were guaranteed by France to projects with a generation capacity of more than 250 kW and the problematic rates were superseded by new tariff levels set in March 2011 and May 2017, with the latter still in force. The original, 2006 tariff was set at €0.55/kWh, with the rate changing in January 2010 to €0.50-0.58 for mainland France and €0.40 for the nation's overseas territories. In August of that year, payments fell to €0.37-0.44 on the mainland and €0.35 overseas. The revised tariffs are being settled on a case by case basis with the French state permitting generators an appeal if they believe the new payment levels will threaten their financial viability.
Solar Holdings brought its actions in connection with its business units in the Caribbean territories of French Guiana and Martinique.
This copy was updated on 15/11/21 to add in the FIT payment levels.

The Swiss Federal Council has earmarked CHF450 million ($488.5 million) for solar rebates in 2021.
In 2021, a total of CHF470 million was available for solar funding. The one-time remuneration covers around 20% of the investment costs, depending on the system performance.
This year, more than 18,000 photovoltaic systems, totaling around 360 MW, have already been registered for the one-off payment. This is about 25% more than in the same period last year. The registrations in the third quarter were 40% higher, compared to the same period a year earlier, and in September alone more than 2,000 photovoltaic systems were registered.
According to the Swiss authorities, all system operators who submitted their applications for PV systems not exceeding 100 kW to the Pronovo AG energy agency, between the beginning of April and the end of August, will receive a guarantee of their one-off remuneration by the end of the year. This year alone, around 26,000 photovoltaic systems of this size should be subsidized and will reach a total capacity of around 350 MW and a total budget of CHF150 million will be paid out for this one-off payment.
Switzerland also supports large photovoltaic systems with an output of 100 kilowatts or more through the GREIV one-off remuneration. In 2021, around 500 of the large scale systems, with a total capacity of 168 MW, received funding. In this way, all applications that were submitted in full by the end of October should be approved.
According to the latest figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Alpine country had an installed PV capacity of around 3.11 GW at the end of last year. In 2020, newly deployed PV systems reached a record figure of 529 MW.

“Our app is currently available only for Japan but we are planning to bring it to the U.S. market as a next step and ultimately [to] expand globally” the company's global expansion specialist, Uto Sean Kayama, told pv magazine. “We are currently in talks with local partners.”
The app is called Change, can be used on any mobile phone or on the internet, and gives users the opportunity to invest in a solar plant with just a few clicks in a single transaction.
In the application, users can view the exact power generated, the location and visualization of the PV plant, and the investment returns, all in real-time. Users can also check how much CO2 they have reduced to check their environmental contributions. “The average sum invested by our users is around $2,000 but we also received orders for very small portions of our solar parks.” As of the end of October, more than 15,000 users had decided to invest through the app, its developer states.
Users are allowed to visualize all PV power assets owned by Change The World and choose between them for their investment. Those that buy more than 1 kW of capacity receive multiple benefits as premium members.
The users do not receive physical documentation of the transaction. After purchasing a portion of the solar power plant, it is immediately displayed in the app, where users can check how many watts they own, their performance, and their return. “Currently, we do not have a transaction verification system,” Kayama specified.
The company built solar plants with a combined capacity of over 16 MW under Japan's feed-in tariff scheme and most of these projects were sold through the app. “Users can now monitor the power production their portions are generating and calculate their revenue,” Kayama emphasized, adding that annual investment return is estimated at around 7%. “The app can also be used for unsubsidized projects.”
“Around 77% of the solar capacity deployed by Change The World consists of agrivoltaic projects,” Kayama further explained, stressing the importance of similar schemes for a land-constrained country such as Japan.
“We officially started a partnership in June 2020 with Japanese airline All Nippon Airways (ANA) and, in July 2021, with Japan Airlines (JAL),” Kayama further explained. “We offer a mileage service where you can earn one mile for every 200 yen [$1.76] spent on solar power plants on our app. In addition, we have partnered with their campaigns and publications in airline magazines, in-flight magazines, and community sites.”
“With our application, we want to get rid of the current stigma the world has on solar investing,” Kayama went on to say. “The current image society has on solar investing is that it is too expensive, too complicated, doesn’t have the facility to place solar panels, and doesn’t know the financial returns. Change allows anyone, regardless of age, income, knowledge, and background to easily start solar investing and become an environmental contributor.”
*The article was updated on November 16 to reflect that the app enables an annual investment return of around 7%, and not of up to 4%, as we previously reported.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/15/redox-flow-battery-with-capacity-retention-of-99-98-per-cycle/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 15, 2021",Redox flow battery with capacity retention of 99.98% per cycle,"Scientists from the South China University of Technology have built an aqueous redox flow battery with a positive electrolyte made of the electroactive organic molecule called TEMPO, which they describe as a chemical compound with easily reversed oxidation states and a high potential for energy.
Also known by the formula (CH2)3(CMe2)2NO, TEMPO is a well-known electroactive aminoxyl radical used in several applications by organic chemists, polymer scientists and molecular biologists. It consists of a bright orange solid that has a stable free radical nature and can be stored for years.
“However, TEMPO cannot be directly applied to aqueous redox flow batteries due to the high hydrophobicity of the molecular skeleton,” the research team said, adding that, when it is left unmodified, it is unable to dissolve in the liquid needed to facilitate the energy exchange in flow batteries. “We developed a strategy to functionalize TEMPO with viologen, an organic compound that has highly reversible redox reactions, to improve TEMPO’s hydrophilicity.”
The TEMPO derivative the scientists developed is claimed to promote the battery's aqueous solubility, as viologen is highly water-soluble, and also to increase redox potential due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of viologen itself.
Furthermore, viologen's densely positive charge minimizes so-called “crossover.” This phenomenon, which can cause capacity losses that can reach up to 50%, occurs during charging and recharging, when battery electrolyte components cross the membrane in the battery cell and the redoxmers – which are redox-active molecules that can store energy in the batteries' electrolytes – migrate to the wrong side of the device.
Moreover, the salt nature of viologen endows TEMPO with a decent conductivity in an aqueous solution, the Chinese group explained.
The viologen-modified TEMPO was tested in an aqueous redox flow battery and was found to help the device retain a capacity of 99.98% per cycle, which they describe as sufficient to make the battery hold nearly all its stored energy when not in active use.
“This work overcomes the disadvantages of TEMPO by viologen-functionalization and realizes its application in aqueous redox flow battery,” said the research corresponding author, Zhenxing Liang. “The molecular design concept provides a strategy for novel organic electroactive materials and lays a foundation for the application of [an] aqueous organic flow battery.”
The process to synthesize a molecular compound that serves as a low-cost electrolyte for the battery is described in the paper Viologen-Decorated TEMPO for Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries, published in Energy Material Advances.

“Our modern, and currently the largest solar power plant in Poland is another milestone in the energy transformation of ZE PAK and the entire region of Wielkopolska as well,” the company said in a statement. “We want ZE PAK to generate electricity only from renewable sources by 2030 – including, inter alia, from the sun, wind and biomass.”
The plant was built with 155,554 photovoltaic modules with an output of 455 W each and provided by an undisclosed manufacturer; 306 inverters; and over 900km of cables and optical fibers. “The farm fence itself, with 16 entrance gates, is 12km long,” ZE PAK added. “There are 31 transformer stations on the site of the power plant, each with a capacity of 2 MVA.”
The facility was built thanks to an investment of around PLN163.8 million ($40.4 million), which is significantly less than what the company announced in November 2018, when the project was launched, and the required investment was estimated at PLN200 million ($49.3 million).
Construction works were provided by Polish companies Esoleo sp zoo and Przedsiębiorstwo Remontowe PAK SERWIS sp zoo.
In March, ZE PAK secured a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) for the project from Polish telecommunications group Polsat.
The solar park will provide the Polish energy provider with the capacity it lost in January 2018 when the Adamow power station, a five-unit coal-fired plant with a 600 MW capacity at the mine, was closed. According to pro-renewables civil society group Fundacja Rozwój Tak – Odkrywki Nie, the Adamów plant was the 13th most toxic coal-fired power station in Europe in terms of its impact on human health.
ZE PAK is Poland's second-largest electricity provider and has an 8.5% share of the Polish power market, according to its website. The company's largest shareholder is the Polish government, with a 50% stake.

In October, Boundary Power – a joint venture between West Australian government-owned Horizon Power and electrical control solutions specialist Ampcontrol – hadn’t even turned one year old when it scooped up design, innovation and manufacturing awards for its standalone power systems (SAPS).
It is currently manufacturing and deploying about 50 SAPS in remote West Australia, but in the new year it expects to jump the deserts of central Australia, cross the boundary into New South Wales and take that state’s customers at the edges of the grid by storm.
Reliability is the stand-out quality of the Boundary Power range of systems, company Director Rod Henderson tells pv magazine Australia. In October, Ampcontrol won the 2021 Hunter Manufacturing Award for Excellence in Product Design for Boundary Power’s Solar Cube, an integrated, foldout, solar-battery-generator combination that can be installed and providing electricity within 90 minutes of hitting the ground.
Henderson says that if rooftop solar in the suburbs stops working for some reason, those properties are connected to the grid. “But in the case of our standalone power supplies, they’re the only energy source those consumers have, so the right technology, the right components, the right partnerships are all-important aspects of our designs,” he said.
He also cites Horizon Power’s flexibility, as a government trading entity, to enter into a partnership with a private company as one of the true innovations behind Boundary Power.
“You know that’s innovative thinking led by Stephanie Unwin. It makes a big difference when you’re working with people who are really on the front foot,” he says of the unique arrangement.
In 2018, when Ampcontrol was in the process of acquiring CPS National, Horizon Power was seeking to address the risks, cost and reliability of providing energy to its most far-flung customers.
After the fires in West Australia in 2015, ageing electricity infrastructure was identified as one potential spark for disaster, the cost of providing and maintaining new infrastructure at remote homesteads and agribusinesses was prohibitive, so Horizon Power investigated the viability of a renewables-led solution and found it promising.
It approached Ampcontrol, with its new CPS subsidiary, to tender for the supply of the first 17 proposed Horizon Power SAPS, but quickly decided that a separate venture combining Ampcontrol engineering expertise with Horizon Power’s energy-utility expertise and customer understanding could have a great future in the transitioning Australian energy scene.

Lazard has released its annual set of levelized cost reports on electricity generation, energy storage, and hydrogen. In this year’s Levelized Cost of Storage Analysis – Version 7.0, the group analyzed 12 energy storage projects, three of which were U.S.-based battery storage facilities coupled with solar power.
The first case study was a direct-to-grid wholesale project, the second was integrated into a commercial-industrial (C&I) site, and the third was located in someone’s home. For the wholesale and commercial analysis, two lithium ion and two flow battery solutions were considered, but the residential site only considered lithium ion models.
The case studies, however, focused on a single battery chemistry. Based on the pricing, it appears that lithium technologies were chosen for the wholesale and commercial projects.

Despite being somewhat less energy dense, lithium ion phosphate chemistry batteries are fast becoming the preferred stationary battery technology due to their thermal simplicity, low price and high availability. In the flow battery space, this author would like to nudge the Lazard folks to consider adding an iron-oxide flow product from the likes of ESS or Form Energy on the wholesale and commercial side, and the Redflow and Zinc8 for residential consideration.
The report raised concerns over future pricing stability and product availability as demand for battery products increases. Lazard cited the automotive industry’s squeeze on lithium ion products, a trend with no end in sight. The report stated that cars today account for 75% of lithium ion cells, although that number is expected to reach 90% by 2030. And, while stationary storage will grow from its current market share of 5%, it will likely fall short of a 10% market share through 2030.
This suggests that even though stationary energy storage will benefit from the technological innovations funded primarily by transportation, it will likely be constrained by the whims of the auto market.
Clearly, parallels may be drawn between the energy storage industry, the computer chip industry, and the solar cell industry.

The three solar plus storage projects – wholesale, C&I, residential – had solar volumes of 50 MW, 50 kW and 6 kW. The four hour batteries were rated at 100 MW, 1 MW and 10 kW. The wholesale battery is located in the Texas ERCOT region, the C&I unit is in California’s CAISO, and the residential unit is located in the Hawaiian power grid. The Corpus Christi, Texas, wholesale facility was projected to have an internal rate of return of 29.1%. None of its cited revenues came from selling solar directly to the market.
Wholesale PV+Storage, ERCOT (Corpus Christi, Texas)

The 50 MW/200 MWh battery must charge exclusively from an AC-coupled 50 MW solar power plant for the first five years to qualify for the full Investment Tax Credit benefit. The analysis forecast an average annual revenue of $4,693/kW for the three types of services the battery provides. Each of these services run only part of the time, although they may run concurrently some of that time.
The largest of the costs to be covered by selling the system’s stored energy is hardware, with $62 of the $85 in revenue going to finance the price of the equipment. Around 11% of the costs go toward buying electricity from the solar power plant.
Lazard suggested that after incentives run out, the California C&I energy storage market will face some challenging financial arguments. With the current incentives, however, the IRR of this office space solar-plus-storage is a respectable 23.4%.
C&I PV+Storage, PG&E (San Francisco, California)

The project is DC-coupled to a solar power plant. The battery is used to load shape the electricity demand of a large San Francisco office space. Most of the project’s revenue comes from bill management of a time-of-use electricity tariff. The California market has cheap daytime electricity due to heavy solar, and expensive early evening electricity. The battery time shifts the solar power to be used in the evening period.
Without this shift, the economics of standalone solar have been getting progressively more challenging. Lazard suggested that without the local incentive payment, battery economics would be challenging as well.
The study did not assign any technical value to the resiliency provided by the batteries in either the commercial or residential settings.
The residential solar+storage project located in Hawaii currently gets all of its revenue from bill management; that is, capturing  its energy from excess solar power, and selling it back to the grid when the sun is down.
Residential PV+Storage, HECO (Honolulu, Hawaii)

This model works primarily because Hawaiians produce so much solar electricity that they’re no longer allowed to export electricity to the grid. The state recently started to pay solar owners to add energy storage in an attempt to give the power grid access to distributed storage during periods of peak demand.
Because electricity is expensive in Hawaii, the financial model works out for batteries. In most states, however, home energy arbitrage does not produce sufficient revenue to pay off a battery. Future models from Lazard may include capacity payments from utilities, like those in Hawaii or like those recently announced in Utah.
And finally, in what may hopefully appear in future case studies, here is a list of “recent project activity” which was researched while Lazard was developing their analysis:
