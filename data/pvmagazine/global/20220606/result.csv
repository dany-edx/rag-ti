The country's economy and education ministries have signed a memorandum of understanding with public-private investment group EIT InnoEnergy, which is backed by the EU's European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), to develop the battery sector. Romania will work with EIT InnoEnergy to accelerate Romania's involvement in the European battery value chain and achieve national and European climate and circular economy targets.
Romania is aiming to develop and implement a national battery strategy that aligns with the needs and opportunities of Europe's value chain. To that end, the country is planning to train some 20,000 people in the field over the next four years to overcome the existing skill gap in the battery sector.
As part of the ambitious undertaking, the country is establishing the European Battery Alliance Academy (EBA), a benchmark program designed to train a workforce across the European battery value chain. The EBA will focus on regions benefiting from the European Fund for a Just Transition, including the counties of Dolj, Gorj, Mureș, Hunedoara, Prahova and Galați.
In addition, partnerships will be formed with several Romanian universities to introduce new bachelor and master programs.
“We aim to be more future-oriented, including in projects related to the circular economy that can attract investment and generate new jobs,” said Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Ciucă. “We want to attract investments of at least €2 billion in the battery sector in the next five years. Today's signing of this agreement with EIT InnoEnergy is a step in this direction. We want to equip the battery workforce to attract investment more easily.”
EIT InnoEnergy CEO Diego Pavía added, “By 2025, battery related projects will create three to four million direct and indirect jobs, which means that around 800,000 workers in Europe will need to be retrained and upgraded with battery-specific expertise. This will require a considerable effort and I am delighted that the EBA Academy has been successful in meeting the training needs in countries such as France, Spain, Hungary and now Romania. To create a more sustainable world, while improving European energy security, we need to build the capacity, skills and investment in innovation to make this happen.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/06/celebrating-golden-decade-poland-set-to-reach-12-gw-of-pv-capacity-in-2022/,"HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,EASTERN EUROPE,EUROPE,POLAND",EDGAR MEZA,"JUNE 6, 2022","Celebrating ‘golden decade,’ Poland set to reach 12 GW of PV capacity in 2022","Poland's solar PV capacity in 2022 exceeded 10 GW in May and is expected to reach 12 GW by the end of the year, according to a new report published by the Institute for Renewable Energy (IEO).
The country is on track to achieve 20 GW of PV capacity by 2025 and a cumulative installed capacity of 28.5 GW by 2030, the “Photovoltaic Market in Poland 2022” report finds.
Regulatory changes and rising electricity prices resulted in a “spectacular success” for Poland's PV industry in 2021, the IEO noted. Installed PV capacity at the end of 2021 was 7.6 GW, with growth of new capacity at more than 3.7 GW.
Highlighting the country's strong PV growth, the authors of the tenth-anniversary edition of the report describe the last 10 years as “the golden decade of Polish photovoltaics.”
As in previous years, individual prosumers made a considerable contribution, accounting for an almost 80% market share. Poland's auction system also brought measurable effects — the first gigawatt of capacity in photovoltaic farms is already feeding energy into the grid.
Installed PV capacity in the EU amounted to 158 GW at the end of 2021, an increase of 21.4 GW. Poland is now likely to be in second place behind Germany in terms of installed PV capacity growth.

The IEO predicts the domestic PV market will maintain its growth in the coming years thanks to the rapid increase in the capacity of photovoltaic farms.
“Solar energy is the primary driver of RES development in Poland,” said Minister Ireneusz Zyska, Poland's government plenipotentiary for renewable energy sources. “This results from a deliberate and responsible government policy aimed at ensuring energy security and a stable energy supply to end-users.”
PV has become the technology with the highest installed capacity in domestic renewable energy, Zyska added, citing the report's findings.
“This is something to be proud of for the industry and a challenge to pave the way for further successes. It is crucial to create the right legal and economic environment for further development of the sector on market terms.”
Further cooperation between the government administration and industry stakeholders is necessary for Poland to continue its energy transformation based on modern zero-emission technologies, Zyska said.
To that end, the country's Sectoral Agreement, approved in December, aims to build up the PV industry value chain with particular emphasis on maximizing the Polish contribution to increase local content.
The report also addresses current challenges related to underinvestment in power grids, rising prices of raw materials for PV panels, including aluminium and silicon, and supply chain disruptions that are hampering the availability of modules and inverters and causing price increases.
“For the first time, the prices of finished installations also increased year on year, by about 5% on average, which is a global trend, but the prices of energy contracted in auction projects did not increase, which distinguishes the Polish market from the global one,” the IEO stated.
“The situation in 2021 is the culmination of many years of work by the entire industry particularly, the PV boom of the last four years, when PV became an investment hit and an economical vehicle on a European scale,” said IEO President Grzegorz Wiśniewski. “In terms of new PV capacity additions in 2018, Poland ranked eighth in the EU27, fifth in 2019, fourth in 2020 and second in 2021, with impressive annual capacity additions: 3.7 GW.”
Wiśniewski added, however, that further success would depend on the effectiveness of removing infrastructure and location constraints and increasing resistance to supply chain disruption through domestic investment in the equipment manufacturing industry and technological innovation.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/06/sharp-achieves-conversion-efficiency-of-32-65-in-flexible-lightweight-solar-module/,"MARKETS,ASIA,JAPAN",EDGAR MEZA,"JUNE 6, 2022","Sharp achieves conversion efficiency of 32.65% in flexible, lightweight solar module","Sharp Corporation has achieved a conversion efficiency of 32.65% in a lightweight, flexible, practically sized solar module developed as part of the “Research and Development of Solar Cells for Use in Vehicles” project, which is administered by Japan's New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).
The module’s conversion efficiency — currently the world’s highest, according to the company — bests that of a similar Sharp module developed under another NEDO project in 2016, which achieved an efficiency of 31.17%, at the time a world record.
The new prototype uses a triple-junction compound design that sandwiches the solar cell between layers of film. The module is expected to be used in a variety of vehicles, an application that demands high efficiency and lightweight construction. Modules measuring about 29 by 34 centimeters (for an area of 965 square centimeters), a size which is large enough to be commercially viable, weigh only about 56 grams (0.58 kilograms per square meter).
Sharp’s triple-junction compound solar cell adopts a proprietary structure that comprises three photo-absorption layers with indium gallium arsenide as the bottom layer so that sunlight can be efficiently converted into electricity. Smaller cells using this structure (with an area of 1.047 square centimeters) achieved a conversion efficiency of 37.9% in April 2013. In 2016, Sharp used practically sized cells (with an area of 27.86 square centimeters) to create a composite module (with an area of 968 square centimeters) to achieve a conversion efficiency of 31.17%, at the time the world’s highest.
In this current project, Sharp increased the average conversion efficiency of its triple-junction compound solar cells (with an area of 22.88 square centimeters) from the 2016 modules (from about 34.5% to about 36%) and improved the cell fill factor on each module to improve the conversion efficiency for a practically sized module (with an area of 965 square centimeters) to 32.65%.
Sharp said it would continue to conduct R&D into more efficient, lower-cost solar modules with a view to their use in such applications as electric vehicles (EVs) and aerospace.
Solar cells for EVs that provide direct electricity promise to make electric cars more convenient for users due to lower fuel costs and less time required for charging.
“Against this backdrop, Sharp has been developing high-efficiency, low-cost solar modules that can conform to the curved surfaces of vehicles for use in a broad range of vehicles, including in standard EV and aerospace applications, by 2050,” the company added.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/06/challenges-and-prospects-in-the-polish-pv-market/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLAND,WEBINAR PARTNER JINKO SOLAR,WEBINAR PARTNER JINKO SOLAR",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 6, 2022",Challenges and prospects in the Polish PV market,"Mr. Jedrachowicz, JinkoSolar has been operating in the Polish solar energy market for several years. Do you think that this market has already reached full maturity?
Certainly, the photovoltaic market in Poland is changing in the right direction. Investors are more and more educated, and more and more attention is paid to the quality of selected components or the installation itself. More and more people are working in the industry and many of them have gained gigantic experience in the last few dynamic years. We have no doubt that there are still many years of stable development ahead of us and that photovoltaics has already become one of the sectors of the economy.
How does the Polish solar energy market differ from other European markets? What are its special features?
The patterns in the Polish photovoltaic market are not that different from what we see in Western Europe. Certainly, we should pay attention to the growth rate, which in the last two years was comparable to that of the largest European PV markets. We also have the largest number of employees in this sector in the whole EU. From the module producer's point of view, unfortunately, this is also the market with the highest price pressure, but we see that this is also changing as the industry is maturing.
It is expected that the Polish market will move from a fully subsidized scenario to a situation where subsidies will be reduced. Do you expect this transition to take place without major problems?
In large-scale photovoltaics, this is happening before our eyes. Currently, there are less and less investors interested in the auction system due to significantly higher energy prices on the exchanges. With rapidly developing technology, investors are able to implement projects that provide a lower LCOE every year and effectively compete with conventional energy. The prosumer market is governed by completely different rules, but in the long run, in an environment of geopolitical risks and rising energy prices, everyone agrees that the demand for installations must continue despite the change from net metering to net billing.
What kind of challenges and opportunities might there be in the near and long term?
Of course, there is a lot of talk about challenges in connection with the expansion and stabilization of the network, and challenges are also posed to the government to make the legislation follow the demands of the market. On the module side, we have set ourselves the goal to provide solutions that will produce more electricity and increase the profitability of the installation, that's why we are moving very fast from modules based on PERC mono cells to n-type TOPCon solutions.
Does JinkoSolar see more opportunities for its own development in the Polish market in the coming years?
Maintaining our leading position in the world among manufacturers of photovoltaic modules, we observe what the market needs and we expand our offer. Soon we will see in Poland not only traditional Jinko modules but also specialized BIPV solutions and energy storage, inverters. At present the scale of installation of these solutions is small but they will gain in popularity.
What are the current price trends for modules and their components? Can you give a short-term price forecast?
The price of modules depends on many factors. It is mostly influenced by the price of polysilicon, from which wafers and then cells are produced. Currently, it is at its historically highest levels. Of course, high demand and recent problems with lockdown in China are also important. We expect prices to remain stable until the end of this year and it is hard to expect significant declines. In the long term, due to plans for significant silicon resources to come into the economy, we also do not expect further significant increases. Unfortunately, history has surprised us more than once in this forecast, so it is safer not to assume any drops, but to focus on project optimization so that the economic effect is acceptable even at higher prices.
Can you say something more about the share of the different module technologies in the Polish market?
The market is still dominated by standard PERC monocrystalline modules. Of course, we are slowly observing a shift towards n-type modules. While HJT modules remain a premium product, with significantly higher prices, TOPCon modules are entering the daily offer and increasing their share. We expect to deliver more than 200 MW of N-type TOPCon modules to Poland alone in 2022. As of next year, we are practically trying not to offer any other solutions anymore.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/06/rec-our-future-is-in-hjt/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NORWAY",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"JUNE 6, 2022",REC: “Our future is in HJT”,"pv magazine: REC just introduced your newest module, the REC Alpha Pure-R. Its predecessor, the Alpha Pure, picked up the Intersolar Award this year in Munich. I understand that the fact that you were able to eliminate lead was a major reason the jury selected the module as a winner. How would you describe the module’s features?
Cemil Seber: The REC Alpha Pure-R integrates G12 wafers, with heterojunction (HJT) technology, half-cut cells, and we’ve maximized power in compact a format as possible with gapless interconnection. And as with every Alpha product it comes with the advantages of HJT technology, like high efficiency and a low temperature coefficient. With the compact size and two support bars, it means that customers can have a good feeling about the warranty – including with heavy snow or wind loads. We really feel we’ve hit the sweet spot in terms of aligning what is best with efficiency, size, sustainability, and on the usual product specs that everybody uses to benchmark PV panels.

I mentioned lead-free, how was it that you were able to do away with all lead entirely?
Some lead can be in the silver paste, but we use lead-free paste. Additionally, we are now using innovative solder-free foil and wire combination, eliminating again the lead-content here. The other place where lead is being used is on the cross connectors, where the lead is used for the soldering. Also, in the JB [junction box] lead is used for the solder. In the Alpha Pure-R, the cross connectors aren’t soldered with lead and there’s no soldering in the JB with lead. These things are easier said than done. But we reduced the lead in the Alpha and now we’ve eliminated it with the Alpha Pure Series.
The foil interconnection was called “busbarless” some years ago. Of course, initially, REC worked with Meyer Burger with the Smartwire technology. How have you moved forward without Meyer Burger on the cell interconnection?
We’re expanding our initial HJT production from 600 MW to 1.2 GW, and for the expansion we’re doing that with equipment that is not from Meyer Burger. REC has worked intensively for many years with its key suppliers to develop other methods that will still be foil and wire based, proprietary to REC.
Looking more closely at the expansion, Meyer Burger also provided the deposition tooling for the HJT cell production. How will you move forward without Meyer Burger providing support and the production equipment?
We have run more HJT cell production than anyone in the world successfully; we have produced close to 1.5 of HJT and have successfully put that on the market. You also have to remember that REC has been in the PV industry for 25 years. We had skeptics with the first Alpha [HJT] modules, but we’ve proven them wrong. HJT also has less processes than other cell technologies and when you have good process control you can have very stable production. The part where REC really excels is in the industrialization of these new technologies and we have a head start. We launched Alpha with HJT in 2019, so we did it 2.5 years before anyone else.
And where will the expansions beyond the 1.2 GW in Singapore take place? We have heard of a facility in France for some time now. And, of course, since REC’s acquisition by Reliance Industries, Indian manufacturing is also an option.
We were acquired by Reliance on December 1, 2021. And with regards to PV, we are the cornerstone of what they want to do. Singapore has been the center of excellence for REC and it will continue to be that way. We had 600 MW of Alpha Pure HJT production capacity and we are adding another 600 MW of Alpha Pure-R. We are currently working on that expansion plan for Singapore – and in August that production capacity will be operating.
In India, we are building cell and module capacities at gigawatt scale. Reliance is looking both upstream and downstream and wants to deploy in the hundreds-of-gigawatts of PV. Of course, REC will be supporting the expansion in India. Outside of that, we have our two main markets: the U.S. and Europe. And right now we are in the planning stages and considering our options in both of these regions.
Can you give me a bit more detail on the French factory?
What we can say is that we are in the planning stage and there are multiple scenarios for what we can do. There are geopolitical dynamics which are favoring manufacturing in both Europe and the U.S.
What about further upstream to wafers or even polysilicon – because this is where REC in Norway has its heritage?
We have a strong expertise across the whole value chain, from silicon in Norway up to modules in Singapore. This expertise is critical in order to control all processes and ensure high quality of the final product and it's a strong value in our expansion plans.
Turning back to Europe, there seems to be a lot of energy in the market at the moment – for installations and manufacturing. What’s your message for the market?
I think a key message is: “We’re growing and we are hiring!” We need to enjoy the moment also. REC has launched a new product and we have bigger plans and some of those plans are very concrete and we are talking about them openly. Others are in the scenario planning phase. Our focus is HJT, and our future is in HJT.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/06/unlocking-ci-around-the-world/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,SPONSORED,WORLD",,"JUNE 6, 2022",Unlocking C&I around the world,"The commercial and industrial (C&I) solar segment is set for a global shakeup. Growatt has released its 125 kW MAX series globally, bringing flexibility and high power to a whole new cohort of customers. And, as a complement to the string inverter for the C&I section, Growatt will also be offering a new tailored storage solution, the WIT 50-100KTL3-H/A battery energy storage system (BESS). It will be available at storage sizes of 50 kW, 63 kW, and 100 kW, in a scalable system configuration up to 300 kW. The new WIT series is expected within this year, offering more flexibility and revenue opportunities for C&I solar.
The MAX 125KTL3-X is the latest model for C&I applications from Shenzhen-based Growatt and had already reached more than 1.5 GW of shipments by the first quarter of 2022. Previously, Growatt’s MAX series 50 kW to 100 kW solution won TÜV Rheinland’s “All Quality Matters” seal, along with other energy storage products winning the same award in 2021.
Designed especially for C&I solar applications, the new MAX model is set with a maximum output power of 125 kW, which is the highest power of string inverter with multiple MPPTs at 400 Vac. With maximum DC input current reaching 32 A for each MPPT and 16 A for each string, this new MAX inverter matches well with high power and bifacial modules. Its 10 MPP trackers support 20 strings at most, which significantly reduces the energy loss caused by shading and module mismatch.
Besides, MAX supports up to 150% DC/AC ratio to achieve lower LCOE for PV plants. With its wide MPPT working range from 180 V to 1,000 V, the inverter can start working earlier in the morning and switch off later in the afternoon, realizing a longer operation time and harvesting much more solar energy.
Growatt also enhances operational safety with Type II SPD on DC and AC sides, fuse-free design, integrated DC switch, string monitoring, as well as optional active arcing protection (AFCI) and built-in PID recovery to provide all-round protection for the inverter and the whole PV system The series also features IP66 enclosures.
As a reference, Growatt’s MAX inverter installations can be found across 500 kW to 5 MW installations, ranging from solar rooftops in the Netherlands to a 1.2 MW C&I rooftop project in Switzerland and a 5 MW ground solar plant in Ukraine. IHS Markit ranks Growatt as a global top-five supplier of commercial inverters.
Growatt has focused its inverters to make system management and maintenance both easier and smarter, Growatt simplifies the management of multiple inverters with Smart Energy Manager, which can also realize export limitation and power factor (PF) control of the system. In addition, the company develops ShinePhone and ShineServer for end-users to monitor system operation anytime, and OSS (Online Smart Service) system for installers and distributors to easily access online service, such as online smart IV scan and diagnosis, remote configuration and firmware upgrade, enabling 60% of issues to be solved without site visits and reducing O&M costs.
Growatt is also bringing simple energy storage to the C&I segment, with the new WIT 50-100KTL3-H/A series, including both hybrid and AC-coupled models – set to launch mid-year for new solar+storage opportunities.
Three products make up the series, with AC output power ratings at 50 kW, 63 kW and 100 kW, scalable up to 300 kW. It offers emergency power supply (EPS) and black start capability, 100% unbalanced load when acting as a backup, 110% continuous AC overloading capacity, with support for remote control of DG, multiple MPPT input and grid-support functions.
The new WIT series devices offer 98.6% efficiency and are IP65 rated against water and dust, with smart air cooling for internal temperature control. It can operate at temperatures between -30 C and 60 C, with derating beginning at 50 C, and to an altitude of 4,000 meters. The device also has an LED display and allows for connectivity via WiFi and app.
Storage provides obvious benefits in terms of self-consumption of excess renewable generation in the solar+storage configuration provided by Growatt’s user-side smart energy solution. The WIT series storage solution can also assist with carbon footprint optimization for better green energy credentials, along with shifting loads to reduce peak energy demand and costs for business owners.
Growatt’s commercial storage inverter WIT 50-100KTL3-H/A, which can be scaled up to 300 kW, offers emergency power supply (EPS) and black start capability.

The system is connected to movable equipment, located underneath the solar panels, which is able to perform linear movements, in combination with simultaneous circular movement of the arm itself, in a spiral pattern with a width of either 60 cm or 30 cm. “The rotating arm is driven by a motor that is powered by the photovoltaic panels fastened to the arm itself,” Demko explained. “The system does not require a connection to the power grid or any other external source of electricity. It is ideal for locations with no proximity to a power network or sites that cannot be reached easily by electricity sources for any reason.”
The system uses an AC asynchronous motor with a rotational speed of 1500 revolutions per minute, and a power of 750 W for motion. It can be equipped with commercially available solar modules of small size, as well as LiFePo batteries and frequency regulators.

The company is offering the system in different variants. The smallest configuration consists of a six meter-long arm with a power output of 1 kW, which is reportedly able to cover a cultivated area of 104 m². The largest system is an 18-meter-long arm with a capacity of 2.4 kW and is able to cover a cultivated area of 994 m².
The system is able to remove weeds between defined lines in one cycle, which is the number of rotations the arm has to perform to move along the whole arm around the axis of rotation, from one end of the driving unit to another end. According to Demko, agricultural entrepreneurs will be able to install the system using only soil screws, which enable the machine to be replaced easily if needed.
“The way of soil cultivation implemented through our system is non-invasive and the soil does not carry the burden of heavy mechanisms which make it extremely dense,” he further explained.
The system is currently being assembled in Slovakia and the manufacturer plans to sell it in European countries where subsidies for agrivoltaics are being provided such as France, Italy, or Spain. “Our system is for all people, small communities and companies that want fresh and healthy vegetables,” Demko stated.
The 18-meter system is currently being sold at around €24,000.

The AUD 40 million ($28.7 million) office tower, being constructed on a 1,043 square meter site at 550-558 Spencer Street in the Victoria capital of Melbourne will be fitted with a building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) skin comprising almost 2,000 thin-film solar panels the same thickness as a traditional glass facade.
While the generation capacity of the BIPV system has not been revealed, Melbourne architecture firm Kennon said when complete, the array will supply almost enough power to cover all of the building’s energy needs. With extra solar panels set to be deployed on the roof, the building is expected to have almost no ongoing power costs and will be carbon-neutral after a few years.
Architect Pete Kennon said the BIPV installation will be capable of producing 50 times the energy of the average residential rooftop solar PV system and will eliminate 70 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions each year.
Kennon said the Spencer Street building would pay off its carbon debt and “actually be carbon neutral”, without relying on offsets and other accounting measures.
“These things are possible and the fact a building can harness the sunlight from its own skin – it sounds like something you dreamed of, or you saw in a cartoon,” he said.
The Spencer Street building will be fitted with a solar skin comprising 1,182 Skala thin-film solar modules supplied by German manufacturer Avancis, a subsidiary of Chinese state-owned company China National Building Materials (CNBM).
Designed for use in ventilated curtain wall systems, the Skala panel measures 1,587 mm x 664 mm but Avancis said each module can be adjusted in length and mounted in either portrait or landscape mode. The copper, indium, gallium, and selenium (CIGS) product comes in power classes from 110 W through to 140 W with an efficiency of up to 13.3%. Using 3.2mm tempered glass, the module weight comes in at about 17kg and is available in nine colors, ranging from black and greys, through to blues, greens, gold and bronze.

Project manager Neoscape said the Spencer Street project is the first building approved by the Victorian Building Authority to use an integrated solar facade system.
The Melbourne-based Neoscape said the design had been approved by the Building Appeals Board of Victoria after satisfying rigorous Australian Standards of Construction in safety, including comprehensive integrated fire testing of the facade system, detailed fire engineering reviews and reports, and endorsement by Fire Rescue Victoria.
“This will set a new benchmark in ESD (environmentally sustainable design) for commercial office buildings, allowing integrated solar facades on buildings across Victoria,” the company said.
The Building Appeals Board said in its compliance assessment that the thin-film modules are proposed to be deployed on all elevations of the building from level 2 to level 7.
“In most parts of Australia, the largest consumption of energy occurs in the cooling of buildings, so we designed the facade to face a solid panel north covered in the solar panel and a clear-vision glass panel south optimizing the effect of the solar panel whilst minimizing the heat gain through direct sunlight,” Kennon said. “This enables a maximum thermal comfort within the building using the solar to run the building with zero carbon emissions.”
Due to be completed in 2023, the Spencer Street building is among a growing number of commercial projects that are pursuing sustainable technologies and innovations as the property sector looks to play its part in Australia achieving its net zero target by 2050.
Australian property investor and developer Cbus Property has revealed plans to clad a 49-storey office tower being developed in Melbourne’s CBD with a BIPV facade capable of generating 20% of the project’s base building electricity requirements. The AUD 1 billion project is expected to be completed in 2026.

Another Melbourne highrise is already earning plaudits for its solar system, with Verergy announcing at the weekend that Walker Corp.’s Collins Square Tower site in the city centre has been named as a finalist for the Master Electricians Australia 2022 Electrical Industry Excellence Awards.
Venergy integrated a 223 kW rooftop solar system with the building’s regenerative lifts and its trigeneration of 600 kW gas turbines across five commercial towers, bringing the site’s total generating capacity to 2 MW.
The Adelaide-headquartered solar installer said the project has been recognized as the finalist in the categories of Energy Efficiency Project of the Year Award and Commercial Project of the Year Award.
Figures published by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) show buildings are responsible for 40% of the world’s carbon emissions and use approximately 40% of the world’s energy. The majority also have substantial carbon footprints, employing heavy use of fossil fuels across their lifetimes, from their construction, use, and demolition phases.
Kennon said that sustainable construction methods and a sustainable future in the built environment had been a driver behind the design of the Spencer Street building.
“We want this building to be a symbol of innovation and sustainability of how the built environment can be part of the climate solution,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/06/us-government-set-to-pause-new-solar-tariffs-for-two-years/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",TIM SYLVIA,"JUNE 6, 2022",US government set to pause new solar tariffs for two years,"From pv magazine USA
The Biden administration is preparing to announce a 24-month tariff exemption on solar modules manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, according to reports first announced by Reuters.
 
The move comes as a direct response to the industry-wide uncertainty that has unfolded since the Department of Commerce’s (DOC) March 28 announcement that it would act on a petition filed by California-based solar module manufacturer Auxin Solar requesting that DOC review solar panel imports from Chinese companies working in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, announcing that it is launching an antidumping investigation into those companies.
According to reports, alongside the moratorium on new tariffs, President Biden will invoke the Defense Production Act as a means to accelerate American manufacturing across the solar supply chain and alleviate overall dependency on imported PV hardware and materials. Reports indicate that the goal of invoking the act is to raise domestic solar manufacturing capacity to 22.5 GW by 2024.
Enacted in 1950, the Defense Production Act allows the President to direct private companies to prioritize orders from the federal government and allocate materials, services, and facilities for the purpose of national defense. The order has been invoked twice since the beginning of 2020, once by then-President Donald Trump and again by Biden, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Invoking the Act will not end the DOC investigation, which is expected to continue, meaning that tariffs could still be imposed after the moratorium, depending on DOC’s ruling. However, according to Reuter’s unnamed source, the impending action would eliminate the possible imposition of retroactive tariff collection, which could have gone as far back as the date of Auxin Solar’s initial petition filing.
Immediate impact
In the months that followed the announcement of the investigation, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) lowered its solar installation forecasts for 2022 and 2023 by 46%, predicting that the case would result in a drop of 24 GW of planned solar capacity over the next two years, more solar than the industry installed in all of 2021.
Developers across the U.S. have already felt the sting of the investigation, which has frozen module imports and left solar projects in development and construction limbo, with some partially-constructed projects sitting idle in the field, waiting for modules.
According to the most recent publication of SEIA’s investigation impact survey, with over 700 responses current to April 26, 83% of respondents who purchase or use modules reported cancellations or delays in their module supply agreements. 13 states had 100% of respondents share that they were experiencing delayed or canceled module supply.
Based on voluntary reporting, responses have outlined to SEIA that a total of 318 utility scale projects accounting for 51 GW of solar capacity and 6 GWh of attached battery storage are being canceled or delayed. What’s more is that a large percentage of delayed projects could move into the realm of cancelation, as developers don’t know when they might be able to get modules and some delays may drag on to the point of project failure.
With respondent data from 39 states, all but two of those states are reporting utility-scale project cancellations and delays above 100 MW in capacity. SEIA shares that these figures also likely only represent a fraction of the investigation’s true impacts. Across the US as a whole, 42% of the known utility scale solar development pipeline has been disrupted. Indiana and Idaho both reported 100% of each state’s known pipeline being disrupted.
With such capacity lost, SEIA estimated that the United States would emit an additional 364 million metric tons of carbon by 2035, missing the opportunity to effectively take 78 million internal combustion-engine vehicles off the road.
Those predictions are based on assumptions of an affirmative decision on the investigation, with tariffs imposed in the 50% to 250% range; sharply restricted module import supply from countries named in the investigation, with manufacturers in non-named countries needing time to pick up the slack; and the updated results of the impact survey.
Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam currently account for roughly 80% of U.S. module imports.
External pressure
Since the announcement of the investigation, the Biden Administration has been stuck between a rock and a hard place, pitting Biden’s goals of decarbonizing the U.S. power grid by 2035 and cutting national greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% by 2030, versus 2005 levels, against existing political pressure to stand against Chinese economic practices and product dependance.
Both DOC and the Biden admin have been flooded with pleas from renewable energy advocates and politicians alike to abandon the probe. So far, 22 Senators and 19 state governors have officially called on DOC to deliver an expedited and negative preliminary decision.
On the other end of the spectrum, on May 26, US Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Bob Casey (D-PA), along with US Representative Marcy Kaptur (D-OH-9), sent a letter to President Biden expressing their support for the continued investigation.
The investigation was also expected to lead to the loss of 100,000 jobs across the solar industry, according to SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. It’s important to clarify that the figure of 100,000 jobs lost also includes new jobs not added, though SEIA asserts that the vast majority would be layoffs of existing workers. 16,000 to 18,000 solar manufacturing jobs would be not realized between 2022-2023 due to the imposition of tariffs, the majority of which would be layoffs. For context, roughly 31,000 people were employed in solar manufacturing in 2020, the most recent year for which survey data is available.
