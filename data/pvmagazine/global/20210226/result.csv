US thin-film module manufacturer First Solar reported net sales of $2.7 billion for 2020, a drop from the nearly $3.1 billion it reported a year earlier.
Operating expenses for the year improved from almost $711 million in 2019 to $363 million in 2020.  The 2019 expenses were skewed by a charge related to settling shareholder litigation over alleged stock price manipulation.
Full-year net income was just under $400 million, or $3.73 a share. That compared to a loss of almost $115 million, or $1.09 a share, in 2019.
Net fourth quarter sales were $0.6 billion. That was down $0.3 billion from the prior quarter. The company said the decline stemmed from higher international project sales in the third quarter, which were partially offset by increased module sales in the fourth quarter. The company said its fourth quarter net income per share was $1.08.
 
First Solar CEO, Mark Widmar, said that the company faced challenges during 2020, including “continued intense competition” across the crystalline PV supply chain as well as “unforeseen challenges related to the pandemic.”
Orders for 2021 got a boost with word that First Solar will supply up to 2.4 GW of its Series 6 photovoltaic solar modules to Intersect Power. The deal, announced on Friday, is one of the largest orders for the modules to date.
Modules will be deployed to seven projects, with deliveries scheduled for 2022 and 2023. The deal with Intersect Power includes options to add almost 400 MW more capacity, subject to the projects’ final designs. Intersect Power placed a 1.7 GW order for Series 6 modules in 2019.
First Solar said it is forecasting net sales for 2021 of between $2.85 billion to $3.0 billion. That includes $2.45 billion to $2.55 billion of module segment sales. Operating income is forecasted to in the range of $545 million to $640 million. The company also said it expects net income per share to range from $4.05 to $4.75.
First Solar has suggested that it is evaluating further U.S. manufacturing expansion, “contingent on the right policy environment.”

Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe, Thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers and Steag are planning to set up a 500 MW hydrogen electrolysis plant at Thyssenkrupp steel production site in Duisburg in western Germany.
The knowledge gained in Duisburg should enable climate-neutral steel production throughout Europe on an industrial scale in the medium and long term and thus keep it competitive over the long term, the two companies said.
They are currently seeking to have the HydrOxy Hub Walsum project recognized as an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) and to secure the associated investment funding from federal and state funds. However, the realization of the project does not depend exclusively on funding from the IPCEI framework.
According to the two companies, HydrOxy Hub Walsum is based on the proximity of the production and consumption of green hydrogen. This means the project does not depend on the construction of a hydorgen network and can be implemented quickly.
If an investment decision is made in spring 2023, the electrolyzer will be connected to the grid as early as 2025 . According to the Steag homepage, securing the green electricity supply is an important part of the project. Steag will ensure that the energy used comes from renewable sources and procure the required amount of renewable electricity.
The two companies also explained that part of the electricity needed to power the electrolyzer will be provided by rooftop PV systems located on the building where it will be located.
Thyssenkrupp announced in June plans to increase the annual production capacity of its electrolyzers to 1 GW. Thyssenkrupp manufactures its electrolyzers with De Nora, its strategic supplier and joint venture partner, in premade standard modules. One module is able to generate up to 4,000 cubic meters of hydrogen per hour.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/26/batteries-double-co2-savings-of-households-with-pv-systems/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,GERMANY",RALPH DIERMANN,"FEBRUARY 26, 2021",Batteries double CO2 savings of households with PV systems,"From pv magazine Germany
German-based market and economic research company EuPD Research has conducted an analysis on behalf of German storage manufacturer E3 / DC to determine how much the addition of a home storage system to a residential PV system can reduce CO2 emissions. 
The analysis considered the case of a household consuming 4,500 kWh of electricity per year and having installed a photovoltaic system with a capacity of 7.5 kW. Compared with a full grid power supply, the household is claimed to reduce its CO2 emissions by 45% with the solar array only, without taking into account the feed-in of excess solar power. If the system is linked to a battery storage system with a net capacity of 8 KWh, emissions are reduced by 79%. With a capacity of 12 kWh, emissions can be reduced by 85%.
In a second scenario, the analysts assumed that the household also installed a heat pump, which increases its power consumption to 8,300 kWh. Without a home storage system, CO2 emissions fall by 32% with a 7.5 kW system, and by 52% with an 8 kWh storage system.
With a 10 kW PV system and 12 kWh of storage, emissions are reduced by 60%, while with an array of 15 kW linked to 15 kWh of storage result in a 71% reduction.
Finally, the experts added an EV recharging unit to the scenario and found that the household's electricity consumption reached 9,800 kWh. Without storage, a 7.5 kW photovoltaic system reduces CO2 emissions by just 28%, but with a 15 kW system and a 15 kWh storage system, emissions can be lowered by 69%.
“The increase in the output of photovoltaic modules that has been observable for years already allows system sizes of 10 to 15 kW peak on conventional single-family house roofs,” says Martin Ammon, project manager and managing director of EUPD Research. “A significant increase in the installed solar output in combination with the corresponding storage capacity is the prerequisite for meeting the requirements of the energy transition in the household.”

In the study Not all homeowners are alike: a segmentation model based on a quantitative analysis of Dutch adopters of residential photovoltaics, published in Social Sciences, the Dutch group explained that, according to the so-called Diffusion of Innovation theory, which examines how ideas are spread among groups of people, homeowners tend to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of a rooftop solar array in relation to their personal situation and the perceived characteristics of the technology.
The scientists developed a segmentation model that is claimed to better assess the heterogeneity of potential new adopters compared to previous methods, as it takes into account the homeowners’ educational background and profession and their environmental commitment. They collected their data from 1,325 PV system owners located in the city region of Parkstad Limburg in the Netherlands. Statistical descriptive analyses and nonparametric tests were used to analyze the data and five segmentation groups were identified.
The first group identified by the academics is represented by environmentally motivated persons with no technical or financial-economic backgrounds. This homeowner typology tends to be influenced by the experiences of other prosumers and can be targeted through existing social networks for the promotion of the PV technology. The most trusted sources for them are neighbours, family and friends.
The second group is made of environmentally motivated persons with technical backgrounds and no financial-economic backgrounds. These are more attracted by the technical characteristics of a PV installation and usually have previous experience with energy matters. “This group can be used and facilitated by policymakers and companies as an ambassador for energy renovation measures such as residential PV,” the study notes.
Environmentally motivated persons with technical and financial-economic backgrounds are those forming the third group, which the researchers defined as very similar to the third group, with the advantage of showing more ability to assess the economic viability of a project.
The fourth group is composed of environmentally motivated persons with financial-economic backgrounds and no technical backgrounds, which are said to be those with lower environmental commitment. “In addition, this group finds inclusivity (everyone can join) in a project less important,” the research group explained.  “Consequently, these two aspects can be highlighted less in communication and marketing to target this group more effectively.”
The last group, made of less environmentally motivated people, comprises all homeowners that do not show interest in improving their “identity expression” when they deploy a rooftop array. “In addition, they trust their system less, which can be countered by a clear explanation of both the RPV system and the conditions of joining the project,” the scientists affirmed.
The findings of the study show that the differences between the five categories are significant. These substantial differences are related to the level of environmental concern, the level of influence of their social network, previous experience with energy or the perceived characteristics of a PV system, such as complexity and aesthetics.
“These insights can be used by policymakers and the public and private sectors to promote RPV more effectively by targeting them more adequately,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/26/sensorless-fault-detection-method-for-rooftop-large-scale-solar/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,TURKEY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 26, 2021","Sensorless fault-detection method for rooftop, large-scale solar","Scientists from Turkey's Dokuz Eylul University and Turkish EPC contractor Entegro Enerji Sistemleri have developed a new fault-detection method for large-scale PV plants.
They said it works “smoothly” for both small and large PV systems. They also claimed that it improved operations and maintenance by distinguishing between faults and changes in weather conditions in relation to project output.
“We have developed the sensorless fault-detection method based on long-term observations on nine ground-mounted PV plants with a total connected capacity of 8.5 MW and 18 rooftop PV plants with a total connected capacity of 8.2 MW,” Entegro's founder, Esref Deniz, told pv magazine. “These PV plants have a variety of geographical features and environmental conditions, which helped us understand thoroughly the inherent characteristics of PV plants.”
The fault-detection technique is not based on the use of irradiance and temperature sensors, but on the DC input data received from the inverters.
“Detailed information of orientations of the modules, inverter size, the peak power of the PV plant, etc., are not required to provide residential and commercial users with an advanced and cost-effective solution for monitoring and controlling their photovoltaic system under cloudy and clear sky conditions,” the researchers said.
The DC power values at the inverter level are considered regardless of cloud conditions, with the data collected via a conventional monitoring system provided by the manufacturer. DC power values are only used during the mapping procedure and the collected information undergoes two pre-processing stages. First, the maximum DC power in every time step is determined and then the difference between all DC powers and the corresponding maximum power in each time step of the available data set is calculated.
The researchers claimed that the algorithm they used to generates the fault condition results of each DC inputs individually. Each DC input is then benchmarked against its own inherent working potential, which is given by the PV plant site’s characteristics.
“We have developed a promising method that rationalizes only the electrical data already gathered from the DC inputs of the inverters,” Deniz explained. “This method has a holistic approach such that every DC side is utilized altogether simultaneously to extract the inherent working potentials of those DC sides individually.”
“Acceleration,” which refers to the change in the distance curve, is introduced to map the inherent characteristics of each PV array in the PV plant, instead of using additional sensors. “It allows us to overcome the misleading effect of weather and environmental conditions on the fault detection,” Deniz said.
It can be economically and technically challenging if a high number of installed irradiance and temperature sensors help to improve measurement accuracy, Deniz said. “On the other hand, our fault-detection method uses the exact electrical outputs instead of the additional sensor-based model. This is an advantage in terms of zero false-positives and, as our fault- detection method requires no additional hardware, any number of sensor usage results in a more expensive solution,” he added.
The researchers described the technique in “Sensorless fault detection method for photovoltaic systems through mapping the inherent characteristics of PV plant site: Simple and practical,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.

Net profit is forecast to rise by 145.91% year-on-year to reach RMB 2.56 billion (around $39 million). Goodwe said the turnover growth is attributable to the fast-growing inverter market both in and outside of China. Furthermore, Goodwe signed a 100 MW distribution agreement with South Korean conglomerate GS Global. The deal will see Goodwe’s 100-225 kW HT series products included in the catalogue of the Korean firm, which split from global brand LG in 2005.
The decision by the board of Chinese glass and display device manufacturer Irico New Energy to switch its focus last year to glassmaking, as margins in the new materials and components business shrank, appears set to pay dividends, with Irico on Wednesday touting an expected 127-145% rise in annual profits to between RMB 212 and RMB 228 million ($32.8-$35.3 million). The New Energy business’ main shareholder is Chinese electronics company Irico Group, which is held by state-owned China Electronics Corp.
China-based wafer manufacturer Zhonghuan Semiconductor announced on Wednesday that, in response to the continuous price hike of polysilicon, it intends to produce thinner wafers with thicknesses of 170 μm, 165 μm and 160 μm. Zhonghuan said its Industry 4.0 factory is already capable for production of these thinner wafers so as to release cost pressures of downstream cell and module customers.
The government of the Chinese province of Yunnan has drafted an ambitious five-year plan that envisages the deployment of another 25 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2025. Around 10 GW of this capacity is expected to come from 31 large scale projects, while the remaining portion should be developed in the form of innovative projects combining wind, solar, hydropower and storage. By the end of the five-year period, renewables should account for around 86% of the region's installed power generation capacity.
*The article was amended on February 26 to reflect that the Yunnan Province wants to deploy 25 GW of new renewable energy capacity by 2025, and not 15 GW as we previously reported.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/26/china-may-deploy-up-to-75-gw-of-pv-this-year/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 26, 2021",China may deploy up to 75 GW of PV this year,"China may add between 60 and 75 GW of new PV capacity this year, according to the Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory (AECEA), which revised upwards its outlook for this year after having predicted a newly installed PV capacity of 42 to 48 GW in November.
The expected additional growth is forecast to come from both the distributed generation and large-scale segments.
Despite increasing land availability and grid integration constraints, the utility-scale business is expected to provide the largest portion of the expected growth, thanks to a 55 GW pipeline of unsubsidized solar projects that were approved by the Chinese authorities over the past two years and 8 GW of projects that participated in auctions held between 2019 and were then converted to unsubsidized schemes. These will have to reach completion by the end of the year. Furthermore, China's National Energy Administration (NEA) could launch two new auctions for large-scale solar with capacities of between 1 and 2 GW each in the upcoming weeks, while the regional governments of Yunnan and the Guangxi Autonomous Region are supporting projects with capacities of 3 GW and 1 GW, respectively.
The China-based consultant also explained that the large-scale PV business in China is moving towards hybridization with different renewable energy technologies, including wind, biomass and hydropower, and is also seeking more frequently to develop projects in the form of agrivoltaic or floating projects or linked to storage facilities. “Single standing utility-scale PV systems designed to “just' generate power might be soon no longer sufficient to receive official project approval,” AECEA stated.  The NEA, on the other hand, is suggesting PV project developers design their plants to ensure that the maximum amount of the generated energy is self-consumed on-site.
As for the distributed generation segment, the analyst revealed that the Chinese government could allocate enough new incentive budget to support between 10 GW and 14 GW this year. Furthermore, the governments of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xian have introduced their respective incentive schemes for distributed solar PV at the end of last year. “All these cities offer a feed-in-tariff (FIT) for between two and five years, except Beijing, which in addition even offers subsidies between 30 and 50% of the total investment,” the consultant revealed. “Moreover, Xian / Shaanxi Province offers RMB 1/kWh with a maximum of RMB 500,000, if PV is combined with an electrical energy storage unit.”
Qinghai has moved even further by becoming China's first province offering a FIT of RMB 0.01/kWh or RMB 0,015/kWh if batteries are locally procured and 60% of the generated power is self-consumed. These incentives are being awarded to solar-plus-storage projects that are grid-connected by the end of 2022
According to the consultant, the NEA is currently defining the new so-called “national unified renewable energy power consumption responsibility targets” for this year and the 2022-2030 period, and the amount of wind and solar capacity expected to be installed in the country by the end of the decade may be much higher than that announced by Chinese President Xi Jinping in December when he said around 1,200 GW was to be expected. “First calculations of what this might mean in terms of cumulatively installed wind/PV power generation capacities suggest between 1,600 and 1,700 GW by 2030,” AECEA experts stated.
According to the latest statistics from the NEA, China reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of around 253 GW at the end of December. Newly installed solar power for 2020 was 48.2 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/26/metal-perovskite-metal-back-contact-solar-cell-with-4-31-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 26, 2021",Metal-perovskite-metal back contact solar cell with 4.31% efficiency,"Researchers at Chitkara University in the Indian state of Punjab have proposed an electrostatically-doped back-contact design for perovskite-based solar cells that overcomes the fabrication and performance challenges associated with conventional sandwiched architecture using charge transport layers. 
The researchers performed numerical simulations and modeling to arrive at an electrostatically-doped metal-perovskite-metal back-contact solar cell structure that offered a significant improvement of 59.4% in power conversion efficiency (with an absolute reported value of 4.13%) over the previously proposed structures in the domain, where the absolute reported value was 2.59%. 
Rahul Pandey, Jaya Madan and Rajnish Sharma from the university’s VLSI Center of Excellence carried out the research. Their work was recently published in a scientific journal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (IEEE), IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices.
Rajnish, who leads the VLSI Center of Excellence at Chitkara University, told pv magazine: “In an earlier reported design of back-contact metal-perovskite-metal solar cell architecture, the carrier collection only relied mainly on the Schottky field across the perovskite layer and hence the performance, particularly in terms of open-circuit voltage, was limited by the work function difference between the self-assembled monolayer (SAM)-modified gold contacts.” 
“The numerical study by our researchers established that an electrostatically-doped dipole-field-assisted metal-perovskite-metal back-contact perovskite solar cell structure could overcome the limitations of dipole-field-assisted metal-perovskite-metal back-contact perovskite-based solar cell structures.”
The researchers proposed placing two additional electrodes beneath the glass substrate to provide the polarity difference and to create an electrostatically doped p-n junction and corresponding built-in potential inside the perovskite layer near the glass substrate. The induced built-in potential offered additional support to light-generated charge carriers for the enhanced collection probability and helped overcome the limitations of the device reported earlier. 
While the back-contact dipole-field-assisted metal-perovskite-metal solar cell reported earlier delivered the conversion efficiency of 2.59%, the design presented by Chitkara University researchers, where electrostatic doping has been introduced, provided a conversion efficiency of 4.13%. 
Design
 The Chitkara University researchers’ study findings may pave the way for the development of “transport layer-free” electrostatically-doped, scalable, and low-cost perovskite-based solar cells in the future.
Their proposed design consists of a perovskite layer deposited onto a glass substrate having self-assemble-monolayer-modified gold-patterned electrodes on one side and polarity electrodes on the backside. The polarity electrodes allow for electrostatic control on the polarity carriers generated, which enhances the cell's open-circuit voltage. 
Quantitatively, 14.2 mA.cm-2, 659 mV, and 44.2% absolute values were reported for short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) — a notable improvement of 24.6%, 17.5% and 9.1%, respectively, over existing structures in which these values were reported as JSC (11.4 mA.cm-2), VOC (561 mV) and FF (40.5%).
For the ideal expected functioning of any solar cell structure, all 100% generated carriers in terms of electrons and holes should find an easy path to the structure’s end electrodes and contribute toward charge buildup. However, most of the cell structures in vogue struggle to make this happen.
In conventional perovskite solar cells, a thin active layer of perovskite is sandwiched between two charge transport layers, an electron transport layer (ETL) and a hole transport layer (HTL). The creation of suitable electric field at the electron transport layer/perovskite and perovskite/hole transport layer interface helps in overall better collection of carriers. But their deployment may also cause performance degradation if side effects like enhanced recombination of carriers at the traps are not managed well. A pictorial representation indicating these losses is presented below: 
Besides these functional issues, it has never been that easy to fabricate perovskite-based solar cell structures, and issues faced on that front due to their moisture-sensitive nature, possible shortening between electrodes due to pinholes and minimization of series resistance lead to additional losses. 
Researchers at Chitkara University worked to possibly overcome all these issues by numerically simulating and proposing a device structure without the presence of charge transport layers and opting for a back-contact design. 
To get rid of charge transport layers, the team proposed the placing of the polarity electrodes with workfunction Фm,p = 5.25 eV and Фm,n = 4.35 eV beneath the glass substrate to create an additional built-in field for the overall enhancement of internal electric field between the back contacts and obtained very encouraging results. Field inducted this way was seen to increase the carriers’ collection probability and improve the conventional structure’s power conversion efficiency. 
Rajnish concluded, “Perovskite has been showing immense potential for the future generations of solar cells. This is one area where there has been almost an exponential growth in achieving the high values of PCE. However, like in all research endeavors, many issues still need to be resolved. We have shown in this work that with the simple addition of two electrodes beneath the glass substrate, one can harvest the benefits of having an electrostatically-doped p-n junction leading to the corresponding built-in potential inside the perovskite layer near the glass substrate.”
“We look forward to support coming in from government funding agencies to make an indelible mark on the international research roadmap in this field,” he added.

Australia-based Relectrify has announced plans to target utility, commercial, and industrial customer applications with the initial release of its ReVolve battery energy storage product, a modular 120 kWh system that uses second-life Nissan Leaf EV battery packs.
The ReVolve battery energy storage system (BESS) is fully integrated with the company’s cell-level battery management system (BMS), inbuilt inverter, and control system. It is designed for installations in the 120 kWh to 2 MWh range.
Relectrify CEO Valentin Muenzel said each three-phase unit provides grid-compliant 400-480 Vac output, with 120 kWh of capacity and 36 kVA of continuous power. The units are suitable for both grid-connected and off-grid applications.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) said Relectrify, which has been working with American Electric Power and Nissan North America on a pilot project, will now finalize development and undertake certifications ahead of the deployment of 20 ReVolve battery units across C&I applications throughout Australia.
“In some ways, we didn’t want to develop this product, but the market really pulled it out of us,” Muenzel said. “Our pre-sales interest in the product has been very wide, from community battery storage applications, utilities looking for back-up and outage support for weak rural networks, and peak shaving for EV charge installs, to construction and mining services firms interested in stand-alone power supply and genset diesel fuel reduction.”
Muenzel said Relectrify’s BMS+Inverter technology – which avoids the need for standalone inverters – means the ReVolve is truly competitive price-wise, coming in 30% to 50% lower than comparable products on the market, while offering an expected lifetime of 3,000 cycles. And at a roundtrip AC-to-AC efficiency of close to 90%, he said the second-life BESS compares strongly against new industrial storage systems.
“The storage market needs affordable battery storage, and we are thrilled to achieve this market-leading competitiveness with this product from the get-go,” Muenzel said. “With Relectrify’s cell-level technology seeing increasingly widespread use, we look forward to working with industry leaders to co-develop future products using second-life or new batteries, including for residential, commercial, industrial and grid applications.”
Muenzel acknowledged that the launch is an important milestone for the fledgling company. But he said the validation of a high-performing second-life system at a strongly competitive price-point is the much larger milestone.
EV batteries are often considered to have reached end-of-life when they have degraded to 80% of their initial capacity. However, Relectrify is determined to demonstrate the second-life battery remains a valuable and useful asset in stationary storage applications.
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the project will help to reduce costs and improve pathways for battery storage to be installed at commercial scale, particularly in industrial settings.
“Battery storage is already playing a crucial role in supporting the transition to renewable energy within industry, however, we need to do more to make it commercially viable,” Miller said. “Second-life batteries have significant potential to drive down costs, and Relectrify’s battery management and inverter technology can provide what is needed to transform them into valuable assets for businesses looking to make the switch.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/26/nrel-looks-at-opportunities-in-lithium-ion-battery-recycling/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"FEBRUARY 26, 2021",NREL looks at opportunities in lithium-ion battery recycling,"From pv magazine USA
Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have released a report detailing the technological, market, and regulatory hurdles to creating a circular economy for lithium-ion batteries.
Battery technology is increasingly in demand for energy storage and for use in electric vehicles (EVs). But its current lifecycle is almost entirely one-way, from manufacture to consumption to disposal, with little thought given to reuse or recycling. Only one U.S. lithium-ion battery recycling facility exists today, the analysts said.
To start to rethink the one-way lifecycle, the NREL team assessed the current state of reuse and recycling of large-format lithium-ion batteries used in EVs and battery energy storage. They found that reusing and recycling batteries could create U.S. market opportunities, stabilize the supply chain, reduce environmental impacts, and ease resource constraints.
They also found that a circular economy would derive more value from battery energy storage systems. Materials would be reused, recycled, or refurbished for multiple lifetimes.
Three barriers
The researchers said that technology, infrastructure, and processes are current barriers. For example, lithium-ion battery designs and makeup vary by manufacturer, making it hard to design a standard process to cost-effectively reuse or recover materials.
In addition, scant reliable, publicly available information exists on the state or volume of retired lithium-ion batteries, or on the cost to recondition them for other uses. The analysts recommended government-funded research, development, analysis, and incentives, as well as information exchanges, to increase knowledge and boost private investments.
Based on their findings, the NREL analysts highlighted existing regulations that could impact the installation and grid interconnection of repurposed lithium-ion batteries. Some states, like California or New York, are revising their regulations to ensure requirements for connecting to the grid specifically apply to battery energy storage systems, said Taylor Curtis, project lead and NREL analyst.
“This is a big development considering interconnection regulations were not developed with these types of systems in mind,” Curtis noted.
Defining waste
Another challenge is that it is unclear how decommissioned lithium-ion batteries are legally defined in terms of waste. As recently as July, no U.S. federal policies directly addressed battery energy storage system decommissioning, or either mandated or incentivized reuse or recovery of lithium-ion batteries.
In general, decommissioned lithium-ion batteries are often considered either hazardous or universal waste, both of which have their own regulations. Regulations also vary by jurisdiction, and non-compliance may lead to fines.
In some states, the penalties for violating hazardous waste laws or regulations are more stringent than federal penalties. For example, the report said that intentionally or negligently violating a provision of California’s hazardous waste laws or regulations can result in a fine of up to $70,000 a day for each violation.
The report said that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has created alternative regulatory controls for recycling materials, such as lead-acid batteries. The aim of those rules is to encourage collecting and recycling hazardous waste. A similar designation for lithium-ion batteries, the NREL report said, could ease liability concerns and make the economics of recycling more desirable.
