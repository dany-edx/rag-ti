The key to the new supercapacitors comes from a method of producing a cement-based material with an extremely high internal surface area due to a dense, interconnected network of conductive material within its bulk volume, allowing for high energy storage capacity.
The researchers achieved this by introducing carbon black into a mixture along with cement powder and water, and letting it cure. The water naturally forms a branching network of openings within the structure as it reacts with cement, and the carbon migrates into these spaces to make conductive, wire-like structures within the hardened cement.
The material was then soaked in a standard electrolyte material, such as potassium chloride, which provides the charged particles that accumulate on the carbon structures. Two electrodes made of this material, separated by a thin space or an insulating layer, form a very powerful supercapacitor, the researchers found. They also pointed out that the amount of carbon needed is very small — as little as 3% by volume of the mix — to achieve a percolated carbon network.
“The material is fascinating because you have the most-used manmade material in the world, cement, that is combined with carbon black, that is a well-known historical material — the Dead Sea Scrolls were written with it,” said MIT professor Admir Masic. “You have these at least two-millennia-old materials that when you combine them in a specific manner you come up with a conductive nanocomposite, and that’s when things get really interesting.”
The team calculated that a block of nanocarbon-black-doped concrete that is 45 cubic meters in size — equivalent to a cube about 3.5 meters across — would have enough capacity to store about 10 kWh of energy.
However, they also found that there is a tradeoff between the storage capacity of the material and its structural strength. By adding more carbon black, the resulting supercapacitor can store more energy, but the concrete is slightly weaker. Therefore, for applications such as a foundation, or structural elements of the base of a wind turbine, the “sweet spot” is around 10% carbon black in the mix, the researchers found.
According to the researchers, the availability, scalability and versatility of the carbon-cement supercapacitors opens a horizon for design of multifunctional structures. There is a big opportunity for employing these supercapacitors for bulk energy storage in both residential and industrial applications ranging from energy autarkic shelters and self-charging roads for electric vehicles, to intermittent energy storage for wind turbines.
Having proved their principle on a 1 V and 3 V supercapacitors, the researchers now plan to build a series of larger versions, starting with ones about the size of a typical 12 V car battery, then working up to a 45-cubic-meter version to demonstrate its ability to store a house-worth of power.
Their findings were discussed in Cement supercapacitors as a scalable energy storage solution published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

German vehicle-integrated PV (VIPV) specialist Sono Motors has shifted its focus to photovoltaic solutions for vehicles, following the discontinuation of its Sion solar EV project in February.
The Munich-based company has initiated a pilot project in Hof, Bavaria, to equip a bus operated by Stadtwerke Hof with a revised version of the “Solar Bus Kit” – Sono Motors' PV retrofit solution for buses.
Sono Motors offers 16 semi-flexible solar modules, totaling 1.4 kW in output, for the bus roof. This lightweight setup, weighing just 50 kg, directs solar energy to the battery supporting the bus's diesel engine.
The solar-equipped bus has gained road approval from the TÜV and is active in Hof. Meanwhile, an equivalent mid-hybrid bus, lacking the photovoltaic kit, serves as a performance and energy consumption benchmark on selected routes.
“We are very excited about the results of the pilot project,” explained Stadtwerke Managing Director Jean Petrahn.
The project serves as a stepping stone towards the gradual conversion of the fleet in the coming years.

It says that residential and C&I installations have reached 4,411.5 MW of cumulative capacity by the end of June, with around 1.82 GW deployed in the January-June period alone.
However, several media outlets have questioned the figures, stating that they also include several non-rooftop installations.
“While the rooftop solar PV industry is experiencing rapid growth in the past year with the constant loadshedding experienced by homes and businesses, the estimates for rooftop solar PV installed capacity in Eskom’s recent status report seem overstated,” Chris Ahlfeldt, the founder of Blue Horizon Energy Consulting Services, told pv magazine. “It sounds like the table also sums estimates for ground-mounted solar PV projects such installations such as those for mines and industrial customers, but not projects procured from the government’s REIPPPP, which would help explain the growth of around 350% growth in 14 months estimate.”
Ahlfeldt said that further clarity from Eskom is needed to substantiate the estimates.  The International Renewable Energy Agency's (IRENA) latest statistics show that South Africa hit 5.82 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of 2022.

UK-based multinational renewable energy company RES Group has acquired the service division of Spain's Ingeteam, in a move that gives RES approximately 35 GW of O&M service and asset management contracts. These renewable assets are around €35 billion worth.
RES plans to integrate Ingeteam's proprietary digital solutions into its existing technological services, covering solar, wind, energy storage, biomass, green hydrogen, and hydroelectric power sectors.
Upon completion of the purchase and sale agreement, RES will become the world's largest provider of operation, maintenance, and support services for renewable energy, according to Ingeteam. However, it did not disclose the specific financial terms of the deal.
“The decision to divest our Service division allows Ingeteam to continue promoting the development of energy conversion systems,” said Ingeteam CEO Adolfo Rebollo.
The acquisition requires regulatory approval in the relevant jurisdictions. The transaction will help RES to expand its operations to 23 countries, with about 4,000 employees.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) projects that the O&M services market will hit 2,400 GW by 2030, with solar energy accounting for 51% of the total.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/02/new-technique-to-recover-lead-in-end-of-life-solar-panels/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 2, 2023",New technique to recover lead in end-of-life solar panels,"Scientists at Arizona State University have developed a new two-step process to recycle lead (Pb) in photovoltaic modules at the end of their life cycle.
“No recyclers talk about lead recovery because it does not generate much revenue but adds to the cost of recycling,” the research’s corresponding author, Meng Tao, told pv magazine. “In the long run it is a liability for recyclers as it is toxic and will sooner or later leach out from PV panels. We are considering lead recovery as part of the overall recycling process we are developing.”
The process utilizes a leaching solution based on a combination of acetic acid (CH3COOH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which the researchers said works as an efficient leaching agent for Pb “in a matter of minutes.” They specified that each solar cell used in PV panels contains, on average, about 0.2 grams of Pb.
The metal is recovered by dissolving it in the leaching solution. After leaching, the resulting Pb powders are rinsed and dried on highly absorbent paper to minimize the formation of lead acetate compounds, which the team said introduce errors during weight measurements. “It is preferred to recover it in the metallic form so it can be sold back to the solar industry for new solder,” the US group said.
The process' second step is electrowinning, a technique that is generally used to recover metals from a solution by means of an electrolytic chemical reaction. The scientists conducted nine electrowinning experiments for different combinations of CH3COOH concentration. They achieved the highest recovery rates over 99% using a 10% CH3COOH solution. 
“These high recovery rates were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) for the post-electrowinning leachates,” they explained. “The 0% CH3COOH solution has the lowest Pb recovery rates for each potential applied, suggesting that CH3COOH aids in Pb electrowinning.”
The scientists noted that the total Pb amount in the solution is approximately 16 mg or 0.05% of the total powder mass. Assuming that 0.2% of the silicon cell's weight is represented by Pb, the total Pb amount in the 1.3 g of silicon cells should be 26 mg, they stated.
The technique is described in full in the study “Lead leaching and electrowinning in acetic acid for solar module recycling,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. “Overall, the leaching and electrowinning process using CH3COOH shows promise as a feasible and safer approach for Pb recovery from silicon solar modules,” the academics concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/02/led-media-facade-for-bipv-applications/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 2, 2023",LED media facade for BIPV applications,"Scientists from the Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) have developed a grid-type light-emitting diode (LED) display with reflective walls that can be used in combination with building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).
“LED displays are electricity-devouring monsters, consuming a lot of electricity at night without electricity generation,” the research's lead author, Dong-Youn Shin, told pv magazine. “If grid-type LED displays with BIPV systems are installed there, they would considerably reduce electricity consumption. Many buildings in South Korea have media facade functions and, however, BIPV has been considered to have a poor aesthetic value due to its dull black color.”
The researchers conceived a grid-type LED display that, by contrast, takes advantage of the black color of BIPV as a backdrop, with the BIPV system behind the LED display not being visible to the human eye over the viewing distance of 172 m.
They built the display with reflective sidewalls to allow more sunlight to be reflected toward the solar cells. “Our display is much cheaper than conventional transparent LED displays because conventional transparent LED displays are made with photolithographically patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glasses,” Shin stated. “Instead, a grid-type LED display is basically made with cost-effective acrylic plates.”
Conventional detachable plane-type LED modules have an air gap between the transparent LED module and the BIPV panels, which reduces the overall optical transmittance of the system. In the upright grid-type LED modules created by the Korean group, instead, narrow bars are connected and form upright grids with LEDs attached, which let more sunlight pass through the voids between the modules.
This system configuration would ensure minimal power yield losses caused by shading. “The grid design leads to a minimum shading loss in the range of -3.67% and -4.93%, considered a record low when compared to -22.59% with conventional transparent LED films,” the scientists said.
Through a series of tests, the team also found that the relative maximum power of a 24-cell solar module is higher than 85.6% with highly reflective walls on an upright grid-type LED module, even at the incident angle of 60 degrees, compared to 70.6% with opaque walls. It also found that the system screen time may reach up to 21.74 hours in a self-standing mode.
The system was presented in the paper “Grid-type LED media façade with reflective walls for building-integrated photovoltaics with virtually no shading loss,” which was recently published in Applied Energy. “Generally speaking, one invention contributes to one industry only,” Shin stated. “However, grid-type LED displays would contribute to not only electricity-related industries but also multiple industries like PVs, BIPVs, building construction, displays, advertising, and tourism.”

Hydro Tasmania said the new AUD 3.35 million ($2.22 million) King Island solar farm, comprising about 5,000 panels spread across an almost 6 hectare site, will increase the amount of renewable energy produced on the island and cut diesel consumption by 300,000 liters per year.
The government-owned utility said the 1.5 MW plant, delivered by Queensland-based GEM Energy, will soon be connected to the local grid, forming part of the existing King Island Renewable Integration Project (KIREIP).
Installed over several earlier phases, the off-grid power system includes another 470 kW of utility- scale solar generation and 2.45 MW of wind backed by a 3 MW/1.5 MWh battery energy storage system. The system also includes two 1 MVA flywheels that aid system security and stability, a 1.5 MW dynamic resistor to manage surplus renewable generation, and an aggregated customer demand response system. The island is also home to four diesel generators with a combined capacity of 6 MW.
Hydro Tasmania CEO Ian Brooksbank said the new solar plant is part of a long-term plan for King Island, which is home to about 1,700 people, to transition away from diesel entirely.
“Over the past 10 years, we’ve slashed diesel consumption on King Island by 50%. That saves 2.1 million litres of diesel and cuts carbon emissions by 5,700 tonnes a year,” he said. “The new solar farm will save an additional 300,000 liters in diesel and 800 tons in carbon emissions annually and deliver even greater reliability in electricity supply for local homes and businesses.”
King Island already draws about two-thirds of its annual electricity from renewables, but Hydro Tasmania said the KIREIP system is capable of 100% renewable operation – the only megawatt-class off-grid system with this capability in the world today.
Brooksbank said King Island, which installed its first wind turbines 25 years ago, has become a renewable energy blueprint for isolated off-grid communities in Australia and around the world.
“This type of hybrid, renewable energy system is also a model for the national electricity market,” he said. “How we integrate wind, solar and storage, while reducing fossil fuels and maintaining grid stability, is an important lesson as the nation transitions to renewable energy.”

Canadian investor Brookfield, which is currently in the process of formally acquiring Origin Energy, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with India’s Reliance Industries to explore opportunities to produce clean energy equipment in Australia.
“Under the terms of the MoU, Brookfield will work with Reliance to explore avenues of direct capital investment and development of skills, knowledge and expertise in the renewable energy sector of Australia to facilitate the nation’s transition to a net zero future,” the companies said in a joint statement. “The MoU aims to both accelerate and de-risk Australia’s energy transition by enabling it to locally produce clean energy equipment such as PV modules, long-duration battery storage and components for wind energy.”
Reliance Industries has strong expertise in solar panel technology and long-duration battery storage technology. It is currently in the process of setting up one of the world’s largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in India.
Brookfield said in June that it, along with its partners in renewable energy projects, will invest up to AUD 30 billion ($19.86 billion) in Australia over the next 10 years. The Reliance-Brookfield partnership plans to support that investment, said the companies.
“Reliance and Brookfield will evaluate the establishment of advanced operations in Australia to make/or assemble equipment used in the construction of renewable energy projects supplying equipment to all players in the market including Origin Energy Markets,” they said.

Soiling losses occur when solar panels are obstructed by particles such as dirt, dust, and animal droppings, leading to lower electrical output. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that as much as $3 billion to $5 billion in lost revenues each year can be attributed to PV soiling.
However, accurate soiling-loss measurements have been a challenge for the global solar industry. As site conditions shift due to localized weather and changing climates, understanding the progression of soiling losses becomes crucial for asset operators to more effectively predict their impact.
Fracsun, with its extensive soiling loss database spanning 22 countries, has partnered with App Orchid, an artificial-intelligence platform, to introduce a comprehensive soiling-loss database and simulation tool. The Fracsun database currently compiles data from 7 GW of solar assets in diverse environments. This tool is anticipated to enhance production modeling accuracy and aid in budget planning for operations and maintenance.
With a simple query to the database, users can predict soiling losses with assistance from App Orchid’s AI platform. The simulation tool makes use of historical weather patterns, particulate matter, and other relevant data, and integrates it with a probabilistic modeling and decision engine. The application is available for any location in the United States.
“Our collaboration with Fracsun proves how the predictive analytics and decision-making AI built on App Orchid’s platform can enable the solar industry to be more sustainable while improving profitability,” said Vaibhav Nadgauda, chief executive officer of App Orchid.
The tool will provide project developers with more precise modeling data, offer operation and maintenance teams a clearer view of operational expenses and maintenance schedules, and give insights to origination teams into the most suitable regions for development.
“Developers and operational professionals alike are often asking for better insight into future costs and production impacts due to soiling for their assets,” said Catlin Matthies, chief executive officer of Fracsun. “This unforeseen impact to project performance has been a source of pain for years and only looks to be getting worse looking to the future.”
The IEA estimates that in 2018, soiling caused at least a 3% to 4% loss to global annual energy production from PV. And this is expected to increase to around 4% to 5% this year, thanks to an increase in PV installations in regions highly prone to soiling, economic pressures, and the fact that more efficient PV modules will suffer larger losses to their output due to soiling.
