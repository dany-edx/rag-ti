Centre Scientifique et Technique du Bâtiment (CSTB), France's national certification organization for construction services, has certified Midsummer's CIGS tech as an integrated unit in Soprema's roof membrane.
The joint solution will allow Soprasolar to offer solar panels to customers in France and other countries, on rooftops that cannot withstand the weight of silicon panels.
Midsummer CEO Eric Jaremalm said the collaboration could “open up a previously unexploited market for solar cells on low load-bearing roofs … It can create a new European industry and at the same time potentially increase the share of solar energy in the European electricity mix. The market is huge for solar cell-integrated roof material solutions that can be installed even on weaker roofs, which is the case in most of the world's countries with roofs that do not have to withstand the weight of snow.”
Midsummer is currently constructing a CIGS solar module production facility in Sweden.

The company said in a March 7 statement that it is committed to deploying more than 60 GWh of battery storage capacity by 2040, which it claims will provide 15% to 20% of UK energy storage. It said large-scale solar and wind projects will be announced later this year.
Plans for a nationwide large-scale battery storage roll out include the development of “GigaParks,” with the first three to go for planning permission this year, followed by 10 next year, confirmed NatPower UK.
It has earmarked GBP 600 million for the development of substations in this initial phase. It said this will help overcome grid bottlenecks and connection delays, which remain a key obstacle in the country’s transition to green energy.
A statement from the company said that battery storage is “an essential element of the net-zero jigsaw” and will help to reduce curtailment, which it estimates could cost GBP 3.5 billion per year by 2030.
 “To solve the bottlenecks that are slowing the shift to clean energy, we will drive investment into the grid itself, collaborating with grid operators to deliver more than 20% of the new substations required,” said Stefano D. M. Sommadossi, NatPower UK CEO. “By investing in substations and focusing on energy storage first, we will enable the next phase of the energy transition and bring down the cost of energy for consumers. We plan to deliver the benefits of the energy transition to all corners of the UK and our portfolio will play a big part in the UK achieving 100% of its targets.”
The UK government has set a target of delivering 100% renewable power by 2035. This includes plans to deploy up to 70 GW of solar by the same year.
In November, the National Grid said it is “speeding up” the connection of around 10 GW of battery energy storage projects in England and Wales.

It will grant the aid through competitive bidding procedures, in the form of two-way contracts-for-difference (CfD). Future projects involving the construction and operation of new PV and onshore wind installations will be eligible.
Under the terms of the CfD, the strike price will be determined through competitive bidding procedures, while the reference price will be calculated as a monthly output-weighted average of the market price of electricity in the day ahead markets.
The European Commission stipulates that when the reference price is below the strike price, the beneficiary will be entitled to receive payments equal to the difference between the two prices. When the reference price is above the strike price, the beneficiary will have to pay the difference to the Romanian authorities. 
“The scheme therefore guarantees a minimum level of return to the beneficiaries, while at the same time ensuring that the beneficiaries will not be overcompensated for periods when the reference price is higher than the strike price,” a statement from the Commission explains.
The aid package was approved under the Commission's State aid Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework, designed to support measures in sectors which are key to accelerating a nations's green transition while reducing fuel dependencies. A statement from the European Commission says the scheme will foster Romania’s transition to a net-zero economy.
“The use of contracts-for-difference provides incentives for the swift rollout of renewable energy sources and prevents overcompensation,” said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission's executive vice-president in charge of competition policy. “This scheme will also contribute to reduce Romania’s dependence on imported fossil fuels, without unduly distorting competition in the single market.”
Romania announced its first CfD renewable energy auction last year. The Romanian government increased its renewables targets towards the end of 2023. Its current plan stands at 36% of the nation's energy to come from renewables by 2030, with 8.3 GW of solar and 7.6 GW of wind. It plans to phase out coal by 2032.
The country hit 2.9 GW of solar capacity at the end of 2023.

5,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/08/weather-records-tumble-across-u-s-as-atlantic-pressure-keeps-eastern-skies-clear/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTH AMERICA",,2024-03-08,Weather records tumble across U.S. as Atlantic pressure keeps eastern skies clear,"A warm end to winter hit most of North America this February. In the west, during February mild air from the Pacific banked up clouds and depressed irradiance by 10-20%, according to analysis completed using the Solcast API. In the east, persistent high pressure in the upper atmosphere led to irradiance as high as 30% above normal, and new records for solar generation and temperature

A clear east/west divide is present in the irradiance anomaly this month. A strong low pressure system sat further east than normal over the Atlantic which brought calm, drier and sunny conditions to the Eastern U.S. and Mexico. Sunnier than normal conditions delivered 20-30% more irradiance than normal from Texas to New England. On the west coast however, high pressure was further west over the Pacific, so that coastal low pressure systems pulled moist air from equatorial regions, leading to increased clouds, blocking irradiance.
Clear skies and higher than normal irradiance will have benefited both large and small scale, solar producers. Residential ‘behind the meter’ solar performed strongly this February all over the East Coast. Solcast’s Grid Aggregation model for NYISO shows residential solar peaked at 3.52GW, and saw 23% more solar generation than last year after adjusting for capacity increases. By contrast, CAISO’s residential solar generation was down 12% on the long term capacity-adjusted average.

Utility scale generation in ERCOT also hit and surpassed their generation peak record, hitting 17.2GW on February 20th. A 50.1% increase in peak generation in February 2023, is mostly a function of capacity increases in the last year.
But it wasn’t just grid performance breaking recent records, temperature records were broken across the country, with the average temperature, more than 4 degrees above normal. Killeen in Texas saw a peak temperature of 38 C (100 F), and Jacaranda trees in Mexico City have been in full bloom all month, 6-8 weeks earlier than normal. Despite the heat further south, areas in Eastern Canada saw significant snowfall caused by a low pressure system stalling over the area, drawing in continuous cold air from the Atlantic. This caused one of the heaviest snowfall events in 20 years, blanketing parts of Nova Scotia with more than a meter of snow.
This extreme weather is reflective of an overall pattern being seen globally, as February 2024 was Earth’s warmest month on record for the 9th consecutive month.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

Gender-balanced and diverse teams are more productive and innovative. According to the report ‘Diversity Wins' (2019) from the McKinsey series investigating the business case for diversity, ‘companies in the top quartile for gender and ethnic diversity are most likely to outperform competitors in profitability'.
So, how is our solar industry performing for equality and diversity? Solar does not only lead in renewable generation; our sector also leads the way for gender inclusion. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency's report, “Solar PV: A Gender Perspective,” we employ the most women (40%) in the energy sector, almost double that of the wind industry (21%) and the oil and gas sector (22%).
But the scenario is far from perfect. This report highlights that 58% of the women are in administrative roles with no progression toward leadership roles, and only 17% belong to senior management positions where decisions are made. The report finds that the PV installers segment's force representation is also low, barely 12%.
This data set shows that we still have plenty of work to overcome external and internal barriers preventing women from pursuing STEM careers, accessing leadership roles, and being fairly represented across the whole value chain.
While structural barriers, such as maternity policies and childcare, belong to government policies that are not exclusive to our sector, we can implement campaigns to attract female talent to our industry.
Overcoming internal barriers involves a proactive approach that combines building self-confidence, self-awareness, leadership skill development, and navigating organizational culture.
Women in Solar Europe (WiSEu) is a Network that provides women with a sense of belonging, tools, skills and role models on their path to career and leadership development. With nearly a thousand qualified members across more than fifteen European countries and partnering with leading organizations in the solar and energy storage industry, WiSEu has become in just a year since its creation in the network of reference for equality, diversity and inclusion in the sector.
In addition to providing networking and leadership-building opportunities, WiSEu is committed to providing visibility for women in the industry. On this note, it is a pleasure to join forces with PV Magazine to present our Ambassadors and Members so they can share their experience and expertise and become role models for other women pursuing career development opportunities.

The project will involve the development, financing, construction, operation, maintenance and ownership of the BESS and associated infrastructure. The chosen developer will enter into a long-term agreement with EWEC as the sole procurer.
EWEC said the BESS will provide operating reserves and ancillary services such as frequency response and voltage regulation, while improving system operability and enhancing overall network stability.
The project aligns with the company’s strategic vision to sustainably diversify its energy portfolio, which includes increasing its total PV generation capacity to 7.5 GW by 2030.
Othman Al Ali, the CEO of EWEC, said BESS offers “unmatched advantages,” including increased flexibility, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and improved efficiency. He added that the utility “continues to see BESS as a critical investment to manage system operability when large amounts of renewables are synchronised to the power system.”
EWEC is inviting developers and developer consortiums to submit expressions of interest for the project before March 22, after which it will issue a request for qualifications (RFQ) to interested parties. The RFQ will provide additional details about the project, the pre-qualification criteria, and the bidding process.

8,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/08/longi-introduces-hpbc-photovoltaic-modules-with-22-8-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,2024-03-08,Longi introduces HPBC photovoltaic modules with 22.8% efficiency,"Chinese solar module manufacturer Longi has unveiled two new modules based on its proprietary hybrid passivated back contact (HPBC) cell technology.
The company has yet to explain exactly what HPBC is, but it is believed to be an extension of p-type interdigitated back-contact (IBC) technology that combines the structural advantages of PERC, TOPCon, and IBC solar. Additionally, BC technology can be combined with p-type wafers, for which Longi has substantial production capacities, giving it an advantage over the more common IBC technology.
The two new modules are called Hi-MO X6 Explorer and Hi-MO X6 Guardian. They have identical dimensions of 2,278 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and the same weight of 31.8 kg. Their power output ranges from 565 W to 590 W and their efficiency spans from 21.9% to 22.8%.
The modules have a temperature coefficient of -0.28%/C.
According to the manufacturer, the Explorer panels offer a first-year degradation of 1.5% and subsequent annual degradation of 0.4% per year, while for the Guardian module, which was specifically engineered to endure high temperatures and humidity levels, the expected degradation is 1% in the first year and 0.35% in the following years.
Longi attributes the strong “heat and humidity resistant” performance of the Hi-MO X6 Guardian to the unique properties of the HPBC cell. It said the absence of silver aluminum alloy in the electrode material reduces the likelihood of electrochemical reactions. Additionally, the module incorporates a double-sided polyolefin elastomer (POE) encapsulant, which reportedly offers seven times more resistance to water vapor compared to traditional ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). The encapsulation process includes a high water-blocking sealant with a molecular structure that enhances water-blocking effectiveness.
The new products come with a 30-year linear power output warranty, with the 30-year end power output being guaranteed to be no less than 88.85% of the nominal output power.

9,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/08/topcon-solar-module-production-hits-cell-bottleneck-in-india/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,2024-03-08,TOPCon solar module production hits cell bottleneck in India,"From pv magazine India
Several solar manufacturers spoke with pv magazine in February at Intersolar India 2024 in the state of Gujarat. Most have started TOPCon module production and are getting a good response from the market.
TOPCon is expected to account for almost 50% of the market by the end of this year. But while some companies are producing TOPCon cells, current industry capacity will not meet domestic PV module demand.
The lack of domestically produced cells is a challenge, even for manufacturers of mono passivation emitter rear contact cell (PERC) modules. This limits the market for domestic panel manufacturers, as government projects under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s schemes and programs require cells to be made in India under the domestic content requirement (DCR).
Cell manufacturers in India have been prioritizing domestic cell production for in-house module manufacturing or exports, particularly to the US market, exacerbating the scarcity of cells for domestic projects.
“While the demand for domestic mono PERC solar cells has surged due to government utility-based tenders and subsidy schemes, the domestic manufacturing capacity has not kept pace, leading to a significant demand-supply gap,” Anurag Garg, CEO of Jakson Solar's module business, told pv magazine. “This has resulted in the cost of domestic solar cells being more than two to almost three times that of imported A-grade cells, despite the wafers for cell manufacturing being sourced internationally.”
Indian cells are also roughly 20% to 35% more expensive than imported cells with the same wafers, further “adding to the complexity,” said Garg. “This discrepancy has put module manufacturers, especially those without their own cell production lines, in a difficult position, making it challenging to meet the demand for DCR modules effectively.”
Garg said this underscores the need to expand production capacity, as p-type mono PERC cell (M10 size) are now the dominant technology in India, with n-type cells “gaining traction.”
“The industry is gradually moving towards technologies like TOPCon, which is upgradable from mono PERC, and HJT, which requires a different cell process,” added Garg. “This transition underscores the need for technological upgrades and increased investment in cell manufacturing capabilities.”
According to Garg, the key challenges to ramping up cell production include high capital expenditure to establish manufacturing facilities, the need for technological advancement, and the recruitment of skilled manpower.
TOPCon and HJT are now the two competing technologies.
“HJT technology typically involves more complex manufacturing processes than conventional solar cell technologies like monocrystalline PERC and TOPCon,” said Tanmoy Duari, CEO of AXITEC Energy India. “This complexity can result in higher production costs, making HJT panels more expensive. In markets like India where cost competitiveness is crucial, the higher upfront cost of HJT panels could be a barrier to adoption.”
The current shortage of DCR cells indeed poses a significant challenge, given the expected increase in demand from government-supported residential solar projects.
“This year, rooftop solar is trending as the government has approved the PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana with a total outlay of about $9 billion to install rooftop solar and provide free electricity every month for 10 million households,” Amol Anand, co-founder and director of Loom Solar, told pv magazine. “There is new excitement among solar panel manufacturers to fulfill this demand in the next 18 months.”
However, Garg views the DCR cell supply problem as a transient issue.
“The construction of new cell manufacturing plants and the eventual operationalization of capacities under the [production-linked incentive] scheme to mitigate the demand-supply gap,” Garg said. “However, these solutions will require time to fully materialize and may initially be insufficient to meet the combined demands of the domestic and export markets.”
Given the crisis in sourcing quality domestic cells and the logical disconnect in their pricing, there’s a strong argument against the continuation of the DCR mandate in its current form.
“The variance in prices among suppliers claiming to use DCR cells, which affects the cost and efficiency of solar projects, further complicates the issue,” said Garg. “Instead of a strict DCR mandate, adopting a broader domestic content requirement that encompasses up to 50% of the total balance-of-system (BOS) could stimulate the development of ancillary industries like frames and glass, which are crucial to the solar panel sector but not covered under the PLI scheme.”

“To address this ‘parking dilemma,' we have characterized the thermal properties of a passenger car for typical summer conditions in a moderate latitude temperate location to be able to explore the vehicle's thermal performance when parked in the sun,” the researchers said.
“The natural follow-up plan is to further explore this concept, with actual vehicles with vehicle-integrated PV (VIPV) systems. It would also be important to examine the concept of solar-powered buses,” corresponding author, Miguel Centeno Brito, told pv magazine.

For their experiment, the scientists used an Alfa Romeo 156, a mid-sized car painted light grey with a black leather interior. On its roof, the academic team installed a custom-made solar irradiance measurement instrument, while the inside temperature was measured by an infrared thermometer that was installed on the gear shift console.
With this setup, the researchers first measured outdoor irradiance and indoor and outdoor temperatures under different shade conditions at different hours of the day. From 7:00 to around noon, the car was parked in the shade and was out in the sun from midday until 20:00.
“Experiment II consisted of heating the car cabin using an electric heater coupled to a fan, with the car parked in the shade,” they said. “With all doors/windows closed, the experiment was conducted for about an hour, with the heater set to an average power 𝑞 = 500 W.”
The initial car cabin and outside temperatures were 21.5 C. A linear growth of the cabin temperature over time was verified, where a total of 390 Wh was used to increase the cabin temperature by 3 C. After fitting the data points, a slope of approximately 4 C/h was obtained.

Using the results from both experiments, the researchers applied them to a set of equations representing a simplified thermal model of the vehicle, solar gain, and heat gain. With those, they were able to find the critical parking time, that is, the minimum amount of time needed for the PV generation to surpass the extra air conditioning load due to the parking session.
“It is found that the effect on the air conditioning load is considerable for vehicles with a low PV installed capacity. For the specific conditions tested, the critical parking time is around 2 hours for a 0.5 kW PV system,” they stated. “For systems with more than 0.8 kW installed capacity, parking in the sun always provides a positive impact on the vehicle's driving range.”
Their findings were presented in the study “The parking dilemma for solar-powered vehicles,” published in Heliyon.

The result was certified by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE). For the same module type, the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg achieved an efficiency of 14.46% in December 2023. That result was a jump up from the previous record of 13.1 % recorded for a 57-cell encapsulated module by Taiwan-based OPV specialist, Ways Technical Corporation (Waystech) and Nanobit.
The module relies on 216 individual 4 mm² solar cells. The devices were built with a substrate based on glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), an electron transport layer (ETL) based on zinc oxide (ZnO), an absorber made of an organic material known as PM6:Y6-C12:PC61BM, a hole transport layer (HTL) relying on the polymer PEDOT-F, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
The group used P1, P2, and P3 laser scribing for building the monolithic interconnections that add voltages between cells in modules. It constructed a module with a size of 143 mm × 143 mm and an active area of 204.11 cm².
The scientists said that, in the cell-to-module scaling up process, there were lower resistive losses thanks to an accelerated blade coating technique that reportedly enabled homogeneous coatings with a thickness deviation of less than 5%. The ETL, the absorber, and the HTL were all blade-coated from non-halogenated solvents in ambient air.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the module achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 15.1% and a fill factor of 76.0%, which the scientists said is the same as that of the individual solar cells used in the panel.
These results should appear soon in the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) champion PV module efficiency chart. “This work presents cutting-edge upscaling research on OPVs that aims at closing the efficiency gap between high-performance cells and modules,” the researchers said.
The new OPV module was presented in the paper “Large-area organic photovoltaic modules with 14.5% certified world record efficiency,” published in Joule. The research team comprised academics from Germany's Nuremberg Institute of Technology, Canada-based OPV material supplier Brilliant Matters, and China's Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

12,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/08/polysilicon-prices-further-decouple-adverse-factors-thwart-contract-negotiations/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,2024-03-08,"Polysilicon prices further decouple, adverse factors thwart contract negotiations","The Global Polysilicon Marker (GPM), the OPIS benchmark for polysilicon outside China, was assessed at $24.25/kg this week, down $0.55/kg, or 2.22% from the previous week, reflecting buy-sell indications heard.
According to market sources, conversations regarding contract negotiations between buyers and certain non-Chinese polysilicon vendors have encountered challenges. It has been reported that there are disagreements between the buyer and seller regarding certain aspects of the new long-term contract, as stated by an integrated player.
According to a China-based source, the pricing mechanism is considered the most challenging aspect of long-term contracts for both buyers and sellers to agree upon. The source further explained that disputes may arise between the parties regarding whether the pricing mechanism should be linked to the fluctuations in Chinese polysilicon prices.
An industry veteran has highlighted the high manufacturing costs as another major obstacle for the operation of polysilicon producers outside of China. The insider explained that the production cost for polysilicon manufactured outside of China has risen to a range between $15 and over $20. Factors contributing to this increase include global inflation and the growing trend of certain firms purchasing metal silicon from sources outside of China.

China Mono Grade, OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon prices in the country were assessed at CNY61.25 ($8.52)/kg, up CNY0.58/kg, or 0.96% from the previous week amid a rise in wafer producers' demand for p-type polysilicon.
As per an upstream source, the product quality of certain polysilicon manufacturers, particularly the newer ones, has reached a stable level. Consequently, wafer producers have augmented their procurement of premium p-type polysilicon and blended them with n-type polysilicon to generate n-type wafers, thereby reducing production costs.
To produce n-type wafers, it is technically required that the metal impurities in the n-type polysilicon do not exceed 0.5 parts per billion by weight (ppbw). However, in practice, wafer producers usually blend n-type polysilicon in a specific ratio with polysilicon that contains metal impurities up to 10 ppbw, the source added.
The increase in production costs, primarily manifested by the rise in power prices, has played a role in driving up the price of polysilicon in China. A market observer asserts that Yunnan and Sichuan, which are home to several significant polysilicon factories, have seen an increase in electricity prices due to their low hydropower output during the current dry season.
Nevertheless, the duration of the rising polysilicon pricing trend in the domestic market of China is uncertain. A market participant notes that the sales volume of polysilicon for the previous week was moderate, suggesting that there is still a divergence of opinion between buyers and sellers regarding the pricing of polysilicon for the upcoming round. Furthermore, polysilicon factories currently hold approximately 80,000 MT of inventory, equivalent to approximately two weeks' worth of production. It is important to note that this figure does not include the stock of polysilicon held by wafer companies.
According to this source, the present circumstances place a lot of strain on the new polysilicon players. This source further mentioned that a brand-new, 100,000 MT polysilicon project, whose construction had begun in February last year, was recently found to have been put on hold midway through. In addition, the producer of a 50,000 MT polysilicon project, which commenced production in June of last year, is presently seeking buyers; however, the process was said to have encountered some difficulties.
As per a market expert specializing in the polysilicon segment, it is projected that polysilicon prices will likely remain around the current level until June. However, as production of polysilicon intensifies in the second half of the year, prices are expected to decrease again, potentially falling within the range of CNY50 to CNY55/kg. At this point, there may be a possibility of certain capacities being phased out.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

The system can utilize water geothermal resources from abandoned mining sites and is based on seasonal control, as it exclusively provides heating.
To enable proper deployment, the researchers investigated the pumping-recharge well arrangement for the system, in an attempt to minimize the heat transfixion phenomenon, which can occur in both open-loop and closed-loop systems. “If the pumping wells are improperly arranged, the low-temperature water recharged into the aquifer could cause the water temperature in the pumping wells to fluctuate, which could lead to a reduction in the efficiency of the water source heat pump unit,” they said. “This phenomenon involving a change in the water temperature in a given pumping well due to backfilling is referred to as heat transfixion.”
To find the optimal positioning, the academics developed a numerical calculation model that accounted for heat transfer and fluidity, among other terms. This model was fed with 14 different well arrangments, including three types involving one pumping well and one irrigation well, five types involving one pumping well and two irrigation wells linearly arranged, and six types involving one pumping well and two irrigation wells in a triangular arrangement.
“A pumping temperature decline of 0.5 K is referred to as the critical heat transfixion point. When the pumping temperature decreases by less than 0.5 K, heat transfixion does not occur, and when the pumping temperature decreases between 0.5 and 1 K, mild heat transfixion occurs,” they explained. “When the temperature decreases between 1 and 2 K, moderate heat transfixion occurs. When the temperature decreases by more than 2 K, severe heat transfixion occurs.”
The scientists simulated the operation of the heat pump system in a single residential building in the Chinese city of Weifang and compared its performance with that of a gas boiler. The building had a peak heating load of 118.02 kW and a cumulative annual heating load of 153,486.91 kWh.
“The abandoned mine water source heat pump heating system mainly comprises a submersible pump, plate heat exchanger, water source heat pump, circulating water pump, and end section. Because the system is only used for heating,” the academics said.
The total energy consumption of the different systems was converted into standard coal consumption. According to the results, the mine water source heat pump heating system consumed 10,872 kg h of standard coal, while the gas boiler heating system consumed 28,622.43 kg h of standard coal. That accounts for a reduction of 17,750.43 kg, or 62.02%. CO2 emissions were reduced by 43,843.56 kg, SO2 emissions by 355.01 kg, and dust emissions by 177.50 kg.
“The operating cost could be reduced by 27,576.04 yuan ($3,872.99) during the heating season, accounting for 30.29% of the total cost savings, and the system investment cost could be completely recovered in approximately 4.65 years,” the research group concluded.
The system was presented in the paper “Investigation of Theoretical Models, Pumping-Recharge Well Arrangements and System Performance of Abandoned Mine Water Source Heat Pump,” published on Energy and Built Environment.

A residential customer of Duke Energy who wants to put solar on their roof, or a commercial customer that wants to electrify its fleet of vehicles, may get a faster response from the utility now that it can complete power flow calculations much more quickly.

Amazon Web Services has worked with Duke Energy to develop a custom solution that speeds the power flow simulations, said Nate Hill, head of energy policy for Amazon Web Services. “That’s not even an artificial intelligence product,” it’s “just a solution” that AWS “custom-built” with Duke, he said, speaking at a policy forum held by the renewable energy trade group ACORE.
The solution is designed to help Duke Energy anticipate future energy demand and identify where and how to “update” the distribution grid, said an AWS spokesperson.
Hill predicted “amazing” AI applications in the utility industry and with power grid operators, especially by “combining our forces and brainpower” with the capability of exascale computing at the Department of Energy, and “all the resources and scientists they have in their national lab network.”
AWS was in discussions with grid operator SPP in 2022 about using AI to speed interconnection studies for utility-scale solar, while a NextEra executive was bringing the idea to other grid operators at that time.
Hill added that Amazon is “bullish” on grid-enhancing technologies and similar approaches, saying they should be studied “very seriously,” but added “it’s not a panacea.”
Speaking of the work of Amazon Web Services, Hill said firms are “early in the process” of switching from on-premise data services to cloud services, “and now you layer on top of that this big transition to machine learning, AI.” He said transmission infrastructure “is going to be one of the key ingredients to allow the U.S. to be a dominant force in this big revolution that’s happening right now.” To maintain U.S. leadership, he said “there’s a role for AWS and the datacenter community” to start planning early and providing “accurate forecasts to our partners,” so they can plan ahead and “plan the right grid.”
Transmission build cycle
Jeff Dennis, deputy director for transmission development at the Department of Energy’s Grid Deployment Office, said at the policy forum that “if we improve transmission planning, like we want to, and if we improve permitting, like we want to, we’re going to build a lot of transmission in a short amount of time. That means we’re going to need a lot of workers, we’re going to need a lot of equipment, we’re going to need a lot of supply. DOE is focused on that for sure. And I know many of you are also, but it will be a tremendous build cycle.”
Dennis also spoke about building “no regrets” transmission lines. He referenced DOE’s 2023 National Transmission Needs Study, which projected a need for 54.5 TW-miles of within-region transmission capacity and 125 GW of interregional transfer capacity by 2035, under future scenarios with moderate load but high clean energy assumptions.
Part of the transmission need, Dennis said, is “simply to relieve congestion that is costing consumers hundreds of millions of dollars a year, especially in extreme weather events.” He said “even if we disagree on what the future looks like,” among 200 different scenarios, “we should build the high value connection options that pop out at you,” because those are “no regrets” options.
Cyberattacks and microgrids
Bill Murray, senior vice president of corporate affairs for Dominion Energy, spoke on the same panel and drew a reaction from the audience when he said the utility fields 3 billion cyberattack attempts per month.
“We have robust cyber defenses,” he said, thanking the utility’s federal, state and private sector partners. “But part of it is also looking at the absolute critical parts of your system.” Saying that “all customers are critical; don’t get me wrong” he added that “microgridding is an opportunity that we’re starting to look at more and more.”
This article was amended on March 11, 2024 to state that the power flow calculations performed using the new solution relate to Duke Energy’s distribution feeders, not to its transmission system.

“The HV Pack utilizes 3U battery modules for flexibility and scalability, and with a capacity of 7.8 kWh per cell,” the company said in a statement. “It is more cost-effective than traditional 5.12 kWh battery modules. The whole system can be stacked in less than 15 minutes by using a simple bracket to stack the modules.”
The batteries feature individual battery modules that can be stacked in series with up to 10 battery modules. Their rated capacity is 135 Ah.
“The wide voltage range allows a single system to support up to 16 modules in series, so you can get an amazingly large system with a capacity of 124 kWh, which is suitable for installations of larger power needs,” Bslbatt said.
The manufacturer offers six versions of the new product, with rated power ranging from 38.88 kW to 77.6 kWh. The smallest unit measures 620 mm x 726 mm x 1,100 mm, while the largest unit measures 665 mm x 330 mm x 1,860 mm. A single pack weighs 68 kg and the high voltage box 20 kg.

18,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/08/vapor-based-deposition-key-to-commercialize-perovskite-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,UNITED STATES",VALERIE THOMPSON,2024-03-08,Vapor-based deposition key to commercialize perovskite solar,"Researchers from 21 organizations in 10 countries coordinated by the U.S.-based National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Germany's Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) assessed the prospects of using vapor-based deposition processes to fast-track perovskite solar cell commercialization, drawing attention to its merits and key areas to research and develop.
“To date, sequential vapor-phase processes may offer the highest, however, there are still too slow dynamic deposition rates,” Ulrich W. Paetzold, co-corresponding author and leader of the next-generation PV group at KIT told pv magazine. The hope is that research into new high-rate deposition concepts like closed-space sublimation, flash sublimation, or sputtering approaches, as well as the exploration of industrial designs for evaporation sources could bring the required performance.
In the study “Vapor phase deposition of perovskite photovoltaics: short track to commercialization?,” published in Energy Environmental Science, the group explained that there is a need to put more effort into researching using vapor phase deposition processes to achieve scalable production of perovskite thin films and to move more rapidly towards commercialization.
The paper highlights the competitive advantages and challenges of vapor phase deposition, discusses the most crucial process parameters in a technology assessment, and provides an overview about the companies participating in the emerging global perovskite industry, according to co-corresponding author Tobias Abzieher, former NREL researcher, now at Swift Solar, a U.S.-based perovskite PV startup. It also contains an outlook on the commercialization of the perovskite technology in general.
Notably, there is an analysis of the industrial approaches of 89 companies worldwide working on perovskite products, including module manufacturers, equipment providers, and material suppliers. “To our best knowledge, it is the first published comprehensive overview about industrial activities for perovskite PV,” Abzieher told pv magazine.
The team also reviewed the literature finding that solution processing dominates. However, the research trend contrasts with the team’s study of the 89 commercial manufacturers. For example, the researchers found that 7 out of 15 of the world’s largest solar module manufacturers, including both silicon and cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV manufacturers, are working on perovskite PV, and that 6 of these are using either vapor phase processing or a combination of vapor phase and solution processing.
Furthermore, 40% of the module manufacturers and 70% of the equipment manufacturers in the study are actively developing vapor phase deposition or combinations of vapor phase deposition and solution processing. The team noted “significant interest” in solution-based processing amongst established companies, while it is the dominant process amongst early-stage solar module manufacturers and equipment suppliers.
Strengths and weakness
Vapor phase processing of perovskite thin films has merit due to its track record in high-quality deposition on textured surfaces, the high production yield and reproducibility, as well as the “simple” integration into existing production lines, according to the researchers. It was also noted that champion solar cells made with vapor-based processing reportedly achieved 24.1% power conversion efficiency in the literature, similar to solution processes.
Another point in favor of vapor processing is its track records in both thin-film PV manufacturing and the highly competitive organic light-emitting display (OLED) industry. It could even be cost-competitive, as revealed by the paper’s techno-economic analysis, which states that, for high deposition rates and large-scale manufacturing tools, vapor phase processing can compete with solution processing, provided that key challenges of vapor processing are solved, such as achieving state-of-the-art efficiency and durability performance along with further research efforts into perovskite compositions, charge transport layers, passivation strategies, and device architectures.
Other issues to resolve include the decomposition of organic precursor materials, the development of process and monitoring equipment, and the improvement of deposition throughput which needs to be “at least one to two orders of magnitude” faster, emphasized the researchers who noted the latter as one of the “most important” parameters to optimize.

The new instrument supports both characterization and a Class AAA light in a single tool. It is designed to test all solar cell technologies, but with a focus on perovskite-silicon tandem cells and encapsulated mini-modules. It contains a fully programmable and tunable spectrum steady-state LED light combined with Sinton Instruments’ solar cell testing hardware and advanced characterization analysis software.
Named FCT-650SE, the instrument has a multi-source LED solar simulator with up to 36 tunable channels for spectrum control, integrated current versus voltage (IV) curve recording, and Suns-Voc measurement capability. It can perform both flash and continuous lighting tests. Also supported are maximum power point tracking (MPPT), light soaking, and automated measurement sequences.
Some of the supported tests and measurements include full IV curve, short circuit current, open circuit voltages, maximum power point, fill factor, efficiency, series resistance, shunt resistance, and Suns-Voc. For silicon devices, it can also measure bulk lifetime, lifetime at max power, substrate doping, substrate thickness, and power loss analysis.
The system has a footprint of approximately 4,645 cm2, which the manufacturer said is on par or slightly more compact than other solar simulators with similar illumination areas.
Its voltage and current range are 40 V and 20 A for silicon and 2.4 A for perovskite tandem devices. The temperature-controlled chuck can accommodate samples that range in size from 2 mm2 to 210 mm2. Custom chuck designs for unusual sizes are available from the manufacturer.
The testing instrument is available from both companies. Several units have already been built and delivered to customers, according to the manufacturers.
