Bill Lenihan: Zola Electric was founded with the mission to solve the energy inequality problem, across the globe, of 2.2 billion people and hundreds of millions of businesses that lack access to affordable and reliable energy.
The company was founded in Tanzania by three mission-driven founders: Erica Mackey, Xavier Helgesen, and Joshua Pierce, who wanted to solve the off-grid African energy access problem.
The energy need is relatively modest but at the time, there was no consistent energy source. Much of the energy was kerosene, which only powered lights and diesel generation, which is expensive and bad for the environment and community.
The main pain points were reliability, storage, and energy management. To solve reliability, you need batteries, and to manage the energy, you need intelligent systems that can adequately manage energy flows.
We installed intelligent batteries in farmers' homes outside of Arusha and we were pleased with the results. It provided 100 to 200 times the amount of light in a renewable fashion, through the provisioning of solar, and substantially impacted the community. Currently, we are serving more than 1.5 million people and businesses across 10 countries in Africa.

pv magazine: Congratulations on securing the funds. What's the overall feeling about the great news?
BL: We feel great! To raise this level of capital in a market ravaged by the pandemic, economic downturns, and underlying volatility in these markets, it shows the quality of the business, and surviving that shows the resiliency in the business model, and that was acknowledged by the investors.
pv magazine: How did you get the funds, and what is the structure of the finance?
BL: The total raise was $90 million, split evenly between equity and debt. Approximately $45 million equity and $45 million debt. The equity bit is from TotalEnergies Ventures, DBL Partners, Helios Investment Partners, Vulcan Capital, Pete Rive, and Lyndon. They are founders of [the] Tesla-owned Solar City and Electron Capital Partners.
It is an incredible group of investors and, importantly, [is] more than capital. Capital is great; we need it. To solve these problems requires capital. The investors bring strategic and competitive commercial benefits to the company. It's a group that is passionate about driving energy equality across the globe.
The $45 million debt part is a combination of FMO, the Dutch development group; SunFunder and others.
Again, the debt financiers are a group of mission-driven investors. They see the vision on how to solve this problem in emerging markets in Africa in particular, and they are willing to put in the capital to help support us.
pv magazine: How will you use and manage the funds?
BL: We are going to use the funds in two major elements. Product development and expansion. As a technology company, we need to invest in our existing technology and build the next technology generation. We need engineers across the globe to help us build great products.
The second element is expansion and commercialization. We need strong partners on the ground to partner with us, find people who need the system, install the systems, service the systems. There is a lot of commercialization that is required here that is still very young in these markets.
We need to support that development by building a team that can connect to businesses on the ground, trying to solve these problems by training them, enabling them, supporting them so they can build and solve problems on the ground.
pv magazine: How many people and businesses have you reached and how many more will you reach, with these new funds?
BL: We have reached 1.5 million people, today. That number is growing more and more rapidly every month. We don't set connection goals. Our mission is the 2.2 billion people across the planet that lack energy access. Our goal is to play a meaningful role in solving that.
We expect, next year, to help solve this for the next million people. Ultimately, the goal is for this technology to solve a meaningful number for those 2.2 billion people that for 100 years have not been able to acquire reliable energy like the rest of the world can. We expect the numbers to be big and that is our mission. Our mission is big.
pv magazine: Have you created jobs and hired locals in countries you are operating in?
BL: The economic employment impact is pretty profound. When people are given reliable, affordable clean energy, the impact on education, healthcare, job creation is huge. I like to think about it at the community level. At the community level, what is the impact?
Our 1.5 million customers have started thousands of businesses. They can work longer throughout the night. So, the economic impact of the product is profound.
The economic impact on this industry is also profound. We have, in East Africa, 500 employees. These are people who are knocking on doors, working in call centers, installing and servicing these systems. They are building the grid of the future.
They are the utility of the future and I firmly believe that distributed energy will be the utility of the future for Africa. Therefore, it needs all the infrastructure, which is people, to enable this network. This industry will create jobs, not in the thousands, but millions in the next decade.
pv magazine: Do you plan to expand to new countries?
BL: Before the pandemic started, we were in five countries, and now we are in 10. We have doubled the number of countries that we operate in [in] a difficult market. We expect the number to continue to grow within our core sub-Saharan Africa segment, it's already expanded to Northern Africa and outside Africa, in South East Asia and Latin America. I hope that vaccination rates grow, Africa learns to operate with Covid, and the market becomes more stable.
The capital is going into expansion. Expansion of our commercialization efforts to bring people into this company that will go and connect to people on the ground that are trying to solve these problems; introduce our technology, introduce our business model to these groups, and operate in their countries.
pv magazine: Talk to us about Infinity and how a customer can access your products.
BL: All the customers need to find out, is if we have partners on the ground in their market. If there [are], the integrator will understand the energy requirements, pain points, and solutions for the consumer. They will then install our Infinity system, a fully integrated solution, into their home or business.
We connect the system to any energy source, [whether] solar, grid, or generator-optimized. We connect it to their power requirements, whatever loads they want to power. Then Infinity, in an intelligent way, manages all that for them, and they can see how it's performing through our Vision platform, a reporting platform.
Vision will learn how to optimize the system. Whatever the customer needs, Vision will perform the need for them, such as reliability, reducing the cost of energy, and reporting on how it's doing; whether it is broken or needs maintenance.
pv magazine: What is next for Zola Electric?
BL: We have some exciting technology coming soon. New technology is coming out that is application-driven. We will expand to new regions, new types of customer, [new] geographies, and new continents different from sub-Saharan Africa and Northern Africa. We need to continue to expand our energy ladder. Expansion is our goal. If we are going to solve this for 2.2 billion people, we better expand!

The company said it will use the funds to expand its business operations and scale up manufacturing of its redox flow battery energy storage systems.
“In the past year, VFlowTech has been actively delivering reliable and safe energy storage solutions to independent power producers,” it said in a statement. “The company has built and deployed high quality energy storage solutions in Singapore, Japan and Australia to support multiple applications, including powering an entire building for Shinoda Group, a Japan-based client using VFlowTech’s PowerCube battery.”
The manufacturer is currently offering the PowerCube battery in three modular products that can be scaled to multi-megawatt-hour systems. The smallest battery, PowerCube 5-30, has a nominal power of 5 kW and a storage capacity of 30 kWh. The device measures 1.5 m x 1.7×2 m and weighs 1,000 kg. Its maximum energy efficiency is 85% and its performance is guaranteed over 10,000 cycles. The operating temperature is between -10 C to 55 C and its voltage is 230 VAC. The backup is indicated at six hours at 5 kW load.
The battery is equipped with sensors and smart Internet of Things solutions for continuous remote monitoring and control. Its roundtrip efficiency reaches up to 80% at 100% depth of discharge, the company said. It claimed the battery is suitable for bungalows, homes in remote villages, telecom towers, and all uninterrupted power supply (UPS) and backup power applications.
The mid-sized battery, PowerCube 10-100, is recommended for applications in remote areas or on islands, as well as in microgrids. Its nominal power is 10 kW and the storage capacity reaches 100 kWh. The device has a size of 3 m x 2.44 m x 2.66 m and weighs in at 2,500 kg. The maximum energy efficiency is 85% and its performance is guaranteed over 10,000 cycles. The operating temperature is between -10 C to 55 C and its voltage is 400 VAC. Its roundtrip efficiency is also indicated at 80% at 100% depth of discharge.

The PV industry has weathered the worldwide Corona pandemic comparatively well. Nevertheless, there are few who would currently trade places with European engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractors.
According to sources, many ground-mounted PV projects are being postponed – chiefly due to high module prices, coupled with increased transport costs, in play since the fourth quarter of 2020. Too few containers are currently available in Asia, especially China, to bring solar modules to Europe. In addition, many companies are having to recoup losses incurred during the pandemic.
But this is not the only dilemma for Europe’s large-scale PV project planners. Recently, the Chinese government has rationed power supply, thus affecting the gigawatt production facilities of China’s PV manufacturers.
“They are currently sending letters and emails to their customers that they have to shut down their capacities,” Michael Nöding, account manager for large EPC companies in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland at PVO International, tells pv magazine Germany in an interview. In doing so, they are invoking force majeure to avoid possible penalties for breach of contract.
Whether this would hold up in a court of law is difficult to assess. In any instance, such a clarification would take months – time that PV project planners with their tight schedules usually do not have, especially if they have postponed projects until winter or next spring. Thus, Nöding recommends close communication with the relevant suppliers to work out a joint solution.
According to an initial assessment by analysts, China is at risk of running a power deficit in the winter despite current rationing. “The world's second-largest economy is at risk of not having enough coal and natural gas to heat homes and run factories, despite efforts over the past year to build fuel stocks as rivals in North Asia and Europe compete for limited supplies,” wrote Bloomberg in a recent statement.
In addition, gas and coal prices are currently sky high, which could lead to astronomical electricity prices in China, and significantly impact PV production in the country. “If coal and gas prices remain high in the coming winter, the risk of a power crisis is high,” according to an analyst at IHS Markit. As a result, she said the Chinese government has already instructed utilities to be better prepared than in the past. However, this “energy saving” is now leading to the downsizing of PV production capacities in China.
“We lack a non-Asian alternative,” Nöding says. He is referring to large-scale integrated PV production in Europe. In recent years, much of the production on the continent has disappeared, while new and ever-larger PV manufacturing capacities are built in Asia and China in particular.
This dependence on China is now also reflected in PV module prices and is tantamount to preventing the energy transition in this country, he said. “We are seeing levels last seen in 2018 or 2019, and further price increases are foreseeable against the backdrop of electricity rationing in China and rising commodity prices – especially silicon,” Nöding says. “Currently, we have a clear seller's market.” There is a low supply of modules and extremely high demand – in China and worldwide, he says, adding, “Companies in Europe are leading the charge.”
The PV module manufacturers in China can, and do, determine the prices for their modules, as the current price level shows. Nöding does not expect to see the usual end-of-year inventory sales by Chinese manufacturers this year. At the earliest, he expects a significantly lower price level for PV modules again from the end of the second quarter of 2022.
PVO International strongly recommends that all project developers take care of the purchase of solar modules on time, in order to be solidly positioned. The timing of the purchase is much more important than the number of modules ordered, says Nöding.
The currently significantly higher PV module prices are spoiling the profitability calculations of many EPC companies in Europe. As a result, many solar parks planned for 2021 have been postponed until winter or even next year.
This means project planners are having to weigh up whether they should accept the higher module prices or whether they should instead pay penalties for the delayed realization of projects, according to Nöding. In some cases, there is also the threat of losing land leases if project construction does not begin, he says.
Nöding sees a “relatively simple solution” for the EPC firms' dilemma: “They have to calculate their photovoltaic systems with higher purchase prices. If, in the end, they do buy more cheaply than assumed in the preliminary calculation, project planners and investors will be pleased,” he says. Unfortunately, this advice comes too late for the ground-mounted PV projects that have already been calculated and are in the starting blocks.
How the situation in China develops remains to be seen. Nöding does not expect any new news this week – China is on vacation. From October 11, we can expect to see how things may play out.

The company has announced it will be offering up around 10,000ha – chiefly near its own solar projects at Batangas, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija, on the island of Luzon – so rival PV companies can co-locate facilities nearby and benefit from economies of scale on a model inspired by India's large, multi-developer solar park sites.
Pick up your copy of the October edition of pv magazine for an in-depth look at the fire hazard concern of lithium-ion battery systems, with a focus on the blaze at Australia’s Victorian Big Battery which caught the world’s attention. Also, Saul Griffith, the guru of electrification, talks to pv magazine about reshaping the climate conversation; we delve into the evolution of residential PV in China; and we continue our coverage of global PV supply-chain issues and ask: Is there an alternative to Made in China?
Quoted in a press release issued by Solar Philippines yesterday, to announce the move, founder Leandro Leviste said: “Our aim is no longer to compete with the country’s power companies but to enable them to build projects, to ensure that solar soon becomes the largest source of new energy in the Philippines.
“The problem we need to solve is that, despite there now being significant demand for new solar plants, there is a scarcity of sites. Our SEZs [solar energy zones] will make it easy for any of these power companies that decide to build solar to locate in these zones and start construction that same year. This would not be possible had we not begun the development of these sites six years ago, when others did not believe that large scale solar would be viable. Now the power industry is convinced that it is, we are making available these sites to help others enter the market.”
The Makati city-based solar developer predicted the sites which will take shape as a result can be expected to be installed over the next five years.
On its LinkedIn page, Solar Philippines describes itself as the largest PV developer in Southeast Asia and claims to have 400 MW of operational or under-construction solar projects as part of a “multi-gigawatt” pipeline which includes “the world's largest off-grid solar projects and the lowest cost solar power purchase agreements in East Asia.”

Barbara Pompili, the French minister of the ecological transition, took advantage of the inauguration of a 20.3 MW solar park on Oct. 4 in Essonne department, in the French region of Île-de-France, to comment on long-expected provisions to introduce a fixed feed-in tariff (FIT) for all PV systems up to 500 kW in size. The move could potentially change the French PV market, after several years of slow development.
Pompili confirmed that rumors have been circulating about FIT levels in the PV sector in recent months.
‘”Our goal is to make the implementation of projects as easy and quick as possible,” she said. “With this decree, all projects of less than 500 kW will be directly entitled to a feed-in tariff of €98 (113.40)/MWh, without having to go through tenders.”
She said the new provisions will help developers to install solar panels more easily on large rooftops, which should limit the consumption of floor space. “I know that many projects are ready,” she saod. “With these new measures, they will be able to materialize quickly.”
Hiowever, the solar industry will need to wait until the decree is published in France's official journal to get more details about the plan.
The minister also said that building-integrated PV projects will be granted a bonus on top of the FIT.
“The aim is to encourage those who are still hesitant to install solar panels on their roofs to take the plunge,” Pompili said. “And this is all the more interesting, as we have companies in France that manufacture solar tiles.”
The plan to introduce the new tariffs was approved by the European Commission in early September. The new rules include cost reductions for the grid connection of PV systems not exceeding 500 kW in size, and the solarization of new buildings.
From Jan. 1, 2023, new commercial and industrial buildings – as well as warehouses and hangars spanning more than 500 m2, and office buildings occuping more than 1,000 m2 of space, will be required to solarize 30% of their surface. As of Jan. 1, 2024, new car parking areas spanning more than 500 m2 will have to solarize 50% of their surface.
The law also includes plans to streamline the authorization process for installing solar power plants on wasteland in coastal areas. It will also facilitate the possibility of launching calls for tenders for large-scale storage and hydrogen projects in metropolitan France.

Few people with knowledge of what will be required for an economy-wide transition to renewable energy doubt that battery energy storage will play a key role in the energy system of the future. But what is needed and what is wanted from end consumers can often be very different things. As such, the adoption of residential energy storage systems in homes and small businesses has been patchy, even among leading rooftop solar marketplaces.
There are an increasing number of drivers for residential battery storage systems each year. But they do differ from market to market. The picture is a complex one, based on public policy, subsidies, grid characteristics, electricity pricing and market structures – to name but a few. Add to this the way in which consumer preferences vary from market to market, and the complexity in battery adoption drivers is notable.
Despite this complexity, the key drivers for residential battery storage adoption can be summarized as follows:
These and other drivers for residential battery storage system adoption play out on the macro level – across various distributed battery marketplaces around the world – but in each market there are discrete versions, each with more tangible value propositions. A household in Vietnam desires backup power, but for different reasons to a consumer in the United States. For an Australian household, the need for a battery may be closely linked to solar feed-in-tariff structures, while in Belgium, existing subsidies provide a significant driver.
Consumers place varying levels of importance not only on the value proposition, but on attributes offered by an ESS supplier. These include brand recognition and trusted service, and extend to size and ease of installation, battery chemistry, and issues linked to the sustainability of the materials. And safety cannot be ignored, as is evident in Germany, where households want to be sure the battery in their basement is “as safe as houses.”
The following three case studies provide insights into the wider drivers and in particular, customer choices in key residential battery storage marketplaces.
Germany has long had a strong market for residential energy storage systems, and with thousands of rooftop PV installations in the country reaching the end of their feed-in-tariff agreements in the next few years, strong growth is expected to continue. Installers are forecasting 20-30% year-on-year growth for the market in 2021.
Local distributor Wagner Solar has been working with Huawei’s latest battery offering, the LUNA2000 solution, for several months already and sees this product as a strong value prospect for the German market.
“We believe that the Huawei LUNA2000 solution is closing a gap. We now have one system by one manufacturer which makes service and support easier for the installer and end customer,” says Stefan Rösch, product manager at Wagner Solar. “Huawei’s brand awareness in the consumer business and their reputation for constant innovation in the solar space, makes it easy to place in the German market.”
Rösch points to a recent report published by EUPD Research that found 79% of end customers in Germany want to increase consumption of their self-generated electricity. Taking a system installed in the western German town of Schermbeck, as an example – where a 10 kWh LUNA2000 battery system accompanies Huawei SUN2000-8KTL-M1 inverters and 20 x 400 W PV modules, along with 12 x 450 Wp optimizers – he explains: “The typical customer in Germany has recently built or renovated their own house, and constantly optimizing their energy costs is a very important factor. So the main motivator to install a battery storage system is still electricity self-sufficiency. The LUNA2000 energy storage by Huawei makes this possible as it also includes optional backup power.”
Belgium is among the first countries to offer a subsidy for the installation of residential energy storage systems. At up to €300/kWh, the scheme promises to reduce the payback period from seven to four years. “Without the LUNA battery the energy self-consumption for residential rooftop PV averages about 15%, and unused power is sold to the grid for 0.04 cents,” explains Robin Maes, founder of local installer MR Solar. “After installing the battery, the owner can raise self-consumption to 65-75% and use stored energy at night instead of buying at 0.25 cents.”
Maes expects similar subsidy models to be adopted across Europe in the near future, as more regions and system owners realize the added value of self-consumption. “Homeowners with solar systems need to store energy for use later into the evening,” he explains. “There is no time to waste energy by feeding it into the grid.”
MR Solar has chosen Huawei for several residential projects in Belgium, including one in the town of Beerse. Here a 10 kWh LUNA battery system was added to a solar installation already operating with Huawei three-phase inverters. And as demand for residential energy storage picks up, MR Solar expects Huawei to remain a key player in the industry and in successful installations. “Huawei FusionSolar provides an all-in-one solution – one service center for all your questions and warranty concerns, one energy storage solution, one inverter fits grid & backup operations, one optimizer, and one software to monitor your solar system,” Maes explains. “Together with easy plug and play installation, this brings great benefit to installer and home owner.”
Vietnam has seen an unprecedented boom in rooftop solar recently, with installations in 2020 amounting to more than 9 GWp. In Ho Chi Minh City alone, local installer Red Sun Company estimates there are more than 200,000 houses with suitable rooftop conditions for solar, as well as a wealth of office buildings, apartment blocks, supermarkets, traditional markets, hospitals, schools and more.
Benny Diep, director of Red Sun Company, cites multiple reasons for Vietnam’s rooftop solar boom, in particular rising electricity prices, falling solar installation costs, and strong public awareness of both the benefits of residential solar and the need for environmental protection and emissions reduction.
Meanwhile, rising energy demand, falling feed-in-tariff rates and concern over grid constraints mean that adding energy storage is an increasingly attractive proposition in the country’s rooftop PV sector. “Vietnam’s energy consumption continues to grow as the economy recovers from the pandemic. Meanwhile, we have seen the PV market explode since 2020 to support this growth,” says Diep. “It is a great opportunity to start focusing on self-consumption and the application of energy storage solutions.”
To demonstrate the advantages afforded by incorporating energy storage into residential solar, Diep points to a 7.37 kW PV system Red Sun installed in Ho Chi Minh City, featuring Huawei’s Smart Energy controller, Smart String Energy Storage System and optimizers. The system was shown to generate 995 kWh per month on average, and the installer estimates the customer will recover their costs in less than five years.
Using Huawei optimizers to control shading impact increases the system’s energy yield by 15%-30% and allows modules with different capacities to be integrated in one string. the Smart String ESS is capable of 100% discharge, can charge from the grid, and means the system can provide power 24 hours a day: increasingly valuable for consumers in Vietnam concerned about rising prices. “The price of electricity after 400 kWh is very high,” explains Diep. “Therefore, solar power users want to be able to store electricity generated during the day to use at night, minimizing the amount of electricity used from the grid.”

Over at the back of hall A5, the mood is positive among European manufacturing equipment suppliers, with the expectation of plenty more capacity to come across the continent in the next few years, and hopes that this could also extend to the U.S.
pv magazine dropped in on German laser experts 3D-Micromac, stringer supplier Teamtechnik, Italian Laminator manufacturer TekniSolar, and a few others, all of whom are expecting strong demand from factories in Europe over the coming years.
Europe’s potential manufacturing comeback is in its early days, however, and it remains to be seen whether the positive atmosphere at today’s show will translate into real projects being built. As Beatriz Roza, CEO at Sticky Solar Power – a Sweden-based company offering a new cell interconnection process based on tape rather than soldering – put it earlier today: “Everyone here is talking about manufacturing in Europe, now we need to do it.”
A relatively new name in solar materials, Endurans – a spin-off of the solar materials activities of Dutch giant DSM – is continuing to consolidate its PV activities.
Endurans is owned by U.S.-based Worthen Industries, and another of its U.S. subsidiaries, Tomark-Worthen, will now be integrated into Endurans. Still following? In short, the move will bring together the two companies’ module encapsulation product portfolios – including polymer based backsheets and ECA.
“We have everything in our basket, so it will be easier for the manufacturers,” said Annet Hoek, who leads Endurans’ global marketing and communications activities. “In the past if people bought our backhsheets, they would have to go to others for other products [like ECA].”
The decision to bring Tomak-Worthen and Endurans together has only just been made, so there are a lot details to be ironed out, but the intention the bring all the encapsulation is clear.
As the solar industry continues to expand and incorporate more people from various educational backgrounds, it is interesting to know that there is an academic route for those of us fascinated by harnessing the sun.
Khadija Ahmed (pictured) is an alumnus of the M.SC. in Solar Energy Engineering offered by The Fraunhofer Academy. Ahmed, who wrote her thesis on saving the energy losses incurred on the edges of bifacial p-type Gz-Si PERC shingle cells, told pv magazine the program has in annual intake of 20-25 students with 100 total students at any one time.
The course, offered in combination with Uni Freiburg and can be completed remotely, has been running since 2010.
Roberta Falato, an agronomist with Remtec, told pv magazine that it produced its (and one of the world's) first agrivoltaic wines. The grape, Trebbiano Toscano, is one of the most cultivated of all Italian varietals, and unlike some Italian grapes, which prefer cooler northern climes, the Trebbiano Toscano is grown mostly in central Italy and likes sunlight just as much as solar panels.
One of the perks of being at Intersolar 2021 is that we got to taste the wine too. Though young, the “Vitivoltaico Cuvée Silvaana 2020” is well-balanced (hence cuvée) with soft acids tempered by notes of candy and dried berries on the nose.
As an agronomist, Falato works with Remtec to design agrivoltaic layouts to optimize light and shading of particular crops, from pumpkin to alfalfa, and of course, wine. The Series 3 fixed, raised agrivoltaic system (model pictured) is set for its first construction project in 2022 in France.
This fixed solution with a rope tensioning method reduces costs and, with a length of up to 50 meters between two posts, it has an enormous span. The difficult thing at the moment is the rising steel prices, which are driving investment costs, said CEO Ronald Knoche. Apparently, this does not detract from the interest in his new offer. “I haven't had a free minute all day,” he laughs.
It can be a designer material for chic homes, but it’s also the sustainable product of choice for the Intersolar floor in 2021: polished concrete.
Doing away with the carpet, The smarter E organizers have no doubt saved a few euros, but they’ve also cut back of 12,000m2 waste – with no need to throw away the carpet at the end of each event.
The new-look also provided module cleaning provider Solarcleano with a chance to show off their polishing skills.

When we think of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), we don't often consider the blank borders we put up everywhere called fences. Next2Sun's CFO Sascha Krause-Tünker told pv magazine that its BIPV fences were introduced in 2019 but are now starting to scale. Perhaps the American poet Robert Frost was being ironic in his poem “Mending Walls” when he said, “Good fences make good neighbors”, but now, thanks to solar, there is such a thing as a good fence.
 Next2Sun also has a fast-growing vertical bifacial agri-PV solution which Krause-Tünker says is receiving increasing interest from farmers, “especially in the north and east of Germany after hard, dry years. Farmers are very interested in Agri-PV as a way to go on farming with a supplementary income from solar,” he said.
When speaking about European manufacturing, PV module lines are what many have in mind. In Finland though, a new company called Ampner has stepped up to a great ancient Finnish tradition: PV inverter manufacturing.
Co-founder and CEO Mika Jantunen says that in the city of Vaasa, where Ampner is based, electrical engineering has always been a big source of employment, with dozens of companies active in the region. In fact, it was in Vaasa where ABB bought its share of Finnish electrical engineers back in the day. For the time being, Mika employs 50 traditional Finnish inverter makers who can assemble 1,000 inverters per month — or about 300-400 MW per year.
With the ACE 300 PV, the company has brought to the market a 300-kW string inverter, capable of handling 48 strings. “We wanted to have the biggest inverter,” Mika says of the large size of the machine. Standing up against stiff competition on a hard-fought market, Mika says that it helps that the Ampner team is not new to solar or inverters. For decades, they have been involved in the electrical engineering and integration of single components. “We can use our know-how from all these years.”
We met with Steven Davies, market manager for DuPont Teijin Films – which is exhibiting its Mylar material for PV backsheets at the show. He says that while they can already produce the material using a high proportion of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recovered from plastic drinks bottles and other consumer goods, establishing a ‘closed loop’ recycling model for PV modules depends on developing processes to separate the valuable materials from the products at end-of-life.
DuPont Teijin is exhibiting old backsheet materials, shredded and ready to reenter production, at its booth – part of a collaboration with Italian backsheet producer Coveme. Davies told us, however, that this process is not currently cost-effective to operate at large-scale, and that at current levels even recycled PET is more expensive to integrate in production than new materials. And though waste modules are already piling up, we are still years away from the volumes that will allow for development of processes at large scale.
Stefan Müller, COO of Enerparc AG, one of the largest German EPC and solar investment companies passed by the pv magazine booth earlier. Having talked with large PV module suppliers at the show, he is concerned about the supply situation and rising module prices – like Everoze (see earlier blog post) and PVO International. Nevertheless, Enerparc has thus far been able to buy enough modules.
The company calculates an average module price for the year, and it purchased a large batch at the beginning of 2021 for a very good price, meaning it can now afford to buy a batch at the current higher prices.
However, Müller says that medium and smaller companies are experiencing problems. Recently, he says Enerparc has been approached by developers looking to give their projects to Enerparc for free, because in Germany you must pay a fine if you do not finish tender projects within the agreed upon timeframe. It would be good if the federal network agency, Bundesnetzagentur, would allow for some flexibility for the realisation dates.
Residential friendly energy storage is an evolving and exciting field. While no one at Intersolar has yet found a way to reduce size and weight, innovations are coming. pv magazine stopped by Hall B to chat with Chinese startup Mango Power, which is bringing portability to the home storage equation.
Linyue Dong showed a prototype of the Mango Power Union, a 6.9kWh hybrid battery power system. Able to be charged from renewable energy sources or from the grid, the unique advantage of the product is its portability: its top section is completely detachable, and features an array of ports and plugs, including wireless and car output, to power anything from homes to phones.
The top section houses a 2.3kWh polymer NCM battery cell, and it can provide UPS support, and features Smart Control via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
Mango Power calls it a world-first and will be shipping the device in China and Europe within “one to two months.” Its RRP starts at €6,000, with volume discounts possible. Weight may be an issue: the package weighs 68 kg, with the top section 20 kg.
As always there are plenty of new technology offerings on show at Intersolar, and not only from the big players you’d expect to see. pv magazine stopped by the startups section in Hall B to meet with Brill Power, a U.K.-based startup promising to extend battery lifetimes through careful management of flow through the battery, down to the cell and module level.
The battery management system promises up to a 60% lifetime extension for all lithium-ion battery chemistries, as well increased safety by managing energy flows through individual cells and modules, and even bringing the possibility of isolating parts of the battery that are causing problems.
Brill says it is already working with battery manufacturers and integrators to add the circuit boards that contain its management solution to battery packs in manufacturing. And CEO Christoph Birkl tells us that one of his aims with this solution is to allow battery manufacturers to offer longer performance warranties.
Many operators of large vehicle fleets have no idea how much electricity their bus or truck consumes. It is, however, reflected in their diesel consumption. “For a bus with air conditioning, entertainment, and WiFi, it can be several liters per 100 kilometers,” reports Mathieu Baudrit, Group Lead at Sono Solar.
The company is known for developing the Sion, a car with solar cells integrated all around the body. While the series production of the electric car is still a long way off, Sono is embarking on a completely new business area – solar integration in existing vehicles, be it EV or conventional. The first customers include MAN and Ari Motor.
The prototype for a small delivery vehicle has been ready since Monday and can be seen here at Intersolar Europe. It is supposed to take over deliveries on the last mile in a fully electric manner and must be plugged in even less often. We will shortly report more about the savings that can be made and how you can solarize your fleet.
The Huawei team tells pv magazine it is excited to be back at Intersolar Europe! This year, it is presenting its latest FusionSolar All-Scenario PV & Storage solution, which unlocks the advantages of ‘smart string’ design, intelligence, modularity, multi-MPPT, high protection, among others, and comprehensively reinvents the power electronics architecture.

While it’s clear there are big crowds and an upbeat mood at Intersolar Europe’s return, constraints are one of the big talking points – and are likely going to depress installations throughout Europe in 2021.
European engineering consultancy Everoze stopped by the pv magazine booth and reported that tight supply and rising prices are holding some PV projects and causing others to be put on ice.
Everoze partner Ragna Schmidt-Haupt said that some developers with whom she is working are finding that supply delays in PV modules and batteries are causing projects to be paused, and even impacting whether some PV power plants can be built at all, particularly when they have bid low prices for tenders or signed low PPAs.
“We are now discussing now whether to increase the risk in the Technical Due Diligence reports because of uncertainty of supply,” said Schmidt-Haupt. “Even for mounting structures,” added fellow Everoze partner Nicolas Chouleur. 
 Modules prices in Europe are increasing, as they are all over the world, with Everoze confirming they are seeing prices quoted up to €0.25/W. “It is something we haven’t seen for a long time,” said Chouleur. “The question is whether it will return [to low prices seen in 2020].” All-in EPC project prices have returned to around €1/W, the Everoze team reported.
This ties into the story we published this morning from pv magazine Germany, where PVO International said PV modules are currently trading at price levels last seen in 2018 and 2019. EPC companies in Europe, in particular, are suffering, while a lack of large-scale integrated PV production on the continent is also playing a role.
The efficiency ratings of modern power electronics routinely achieve 98% and higher but that maximum level is only relevant when running on a full load, and inverters are hardly ever going at full throttle.
pv magazine‘s Marian Willuhn has found this device at Intersolar, though, by researchers at the Fraunhofer institute.
Thanks to silicon-carbide MOSFETs and intelligent steering of the switches, this 6 kW battery inverter module is said to achieve maximum efficiency of 99% – at just 200 W of load.
In the back, there is a 40 kW inverter to create DC from grid power and the device’s smart and active controls prevent it from having any effect on the grid. After all, if 20 GW worth of electrolyzers and EV chargers were to turn AC into DC without proper control algorithms, grid operators would become very nervous.
We've had our first grumpy update of the day, with pv magazine chief Jonathan Gifford noting there are bigger delays than usual at the entrance to an event which has been tagged ‘Intersolar Restart.'
The gaffer suspects Covid testing is playing its part but also noted there seem to be fewer staff at the entrance than in previous years.
Anyhoo, those of you yet to to arrive should prepare yourselves accordingly and, in case you haven't been reading this blog religiously up to now, you should also note that this year, the show entrance is at the eastern end of the site, at the Messestadt Ost tube stop.
That's Walburga Hemetsberger, chief executive of trade body SolarPower Europe dropping in to the Meyer Burger booth.
With ‘made in Europe' solar cells and modules a hot topic at this year's show, Walburga (we're on first-name terms, you see) told pv magazine‘s Michael Fuhs she is looking forward to development in the continent's solar manufacturing industry.
Come along and say hello to the pv magazine crew at our booth, we've missed y'all!
To find us, turn left after entering the show at Messestadt Ost, into hall A6, then hang a right and you'll find us near the Meyer Burger and Trina Solar booths, at a6.540, for those of you familiar with the Intersolar location jargon.
Our head of marketing Marina Ramain (that's Marina on the right, there) will be waiting to say hello and, if you're lucky, we might even get the kettle on.
Here's a shot of the queues starting to form near the Messestadt Ost stop on the Munich metro which leads to the entrance to this year's Intersolar Europe trade show.
Exhibitors have already setting up for what promises to be a dynamic return of the event, with residential and commercial electric vehicle charging among the hot topics for discussion at the return of Intersolar.
The editorial team will be scouring the halls and meeting with the established market leaders, the new kids on the block, and the industry’s leading analysts to bring you the latest PV and energy storage news from the ground.
In addition to reporting on the latest PV product launches, we’ll be looking to find out more about the most pertinent solar issues, like supply chain disruption, PV module prices, carbon pricing, European manufacturing, and the state of hydrogen, among many other issues.
Send your impressions of Intersolar Europe to liveblog@pv-magazine.com. We'll try to feature as many of your comments here too!  "
https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/06/ultrathin-gallium-arsenide-solar-cell-with-light-management-architecture/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 6, 2021",Ultrathin gallium-arsenide solar cell with light management architecture,"Gallium-arsenide (GaAs), and other cell materials from the III-V group, have long been an area of interest for researchers working in solar PV thanks to their potential for very high efficiency. The cost of the materials, however, has kept these materials limited to niche applications such as drones and space travel.
Making the devices thinner, minimizing use of the valuable materials, is one well-explored approach to bring down manufacturing cost. And for the niche applications where GaAs is already viable, weight reduction achieved by making a device thinner is a valuable prospect, and thinner devices also show improved resistance to the higher radiation levels outside of Earth’s atmosphere.
Maintaining high efficiencies, however, becomes a challenge as thickness is reduced, because there is less material available to absorb the light. Adding light management structures, that can trap photons for longer and increase their chance of being absorbed and converted to electricity. This was the approach taken by scientists at Cambridge University in the UK, who aim to overcome the efficiency challenges with ultrathin devices, allowing them to take advantage of their lower weight and intrinsic radiation resistance.
“Intrinsic radiation tolerance that has previously been demonstrated on this length scale is sufficient to enable new mission types in hostile environments as well as lightweight flexible form factors by reducing or eliminating the need for protective coverglass,” the group stated. “However, the ultra-thin absorbers are highly transmissive and require integrated light management to increase current.”
The group fabricated GaAs cells just with an active layer just 80 nanometers (nm) thick, adding up to 120 nm when window and back surface field layers are added. Using a patterning technique known as displacement talbot lithography (DTL), the group integrated light management architectures onto the cells and compared their performance to cells to others that integrated a planar silver mirror to reflect light back to the cell. “[DTL] is inherently suited to wafer-scale, high throughput fabrication and therefore a feasible approach for manufacturing large area photovoltaic devices with integrated light management,” they explained.
The devices are described in the paper Ultra-thin GaAs solar cells with nanophotonic metal-dielectric diffraction gratings fabricated with displacement Talbot lithography, published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The group was able to demonstrate 9.08% efficiency – a 68% improvement compared to a device that used on-wafer processing.
Using simulations, the group was further able to demonstrate that the addition of an anti-reflective coating, and further innovations to reduce frontside grid surface shading, could quickly boost this efficiency to 16%. They note that while this type of device is unlikely to be useful for mainstream PV applications, they hope to open new possibilities for power generation in space, and other potential applications. “These results show that future embodiments of ultra-thin devices are unlikely to complete with current industry standard multijunction photovoltaics on efficiency alone,” they conclude. “However, the potential efficiency gains of nanophotonic integration demonstrated here, alongside low mass and inherent radiation tolerance, might enable new mission profiles and launch cost reductions, making ultra-thin devices a compelling platform for development.”

Scientists from the University of California-Davis, Lancaster University, and Ludong University in China published research showing that utility-scale solar facilities can have a cooling effect not only on the land covered by the array, but also in the surrounding area.
Solar facilities were found to produce “cool islands” that extend up to 700 meters from the boundaries of the arrays. Land surface temperature was reduced by up to 2.3 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) at 100 meters away; the cooling effects tapered off exponentially to 700 meters.
Studies of two solar parks–the 300 MW Stateline project in California and the 850 MW Longyangxia project in China–were conducted using Landsat satellite images, an approach the researchers said had not previously been applied to solar. The study team compared land surface temperatures around solar facilities before and after they were built. The Stateline solar park measurements were supplemented with ground-collected data.
The researchers hypothesized that the cooling was caused by a combination of shading and insulating the land surface, and by the direct conversion of energy into electricity by the solar panels.
The study authors concluded the effect could have impact on local ecological processes. Productivity, decomposition, and ultimately the carbon balance could be skewed by the cooling. The scale of effect depends on location, and impacts could range from positive, negative, or inconsequential based on local ecosystems.
For example, in California’s Mojave Desert, lower surface temperatures leads to reduced germination rates and a loss of biodiversity. But, in the Tibetan Plateau, lower surface temperatures could potentially reduce the amount of methane lost to the atmosphere, said the scientists.
“This heightens the importance of understanding the implications of renewable energy technologies on the hosting landscape – we need to ensure that the energy transition does not cause undue damage to ecological systems and ideally has net positive consequences on the places where we build them,” said the research, which was published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Transition.
The studies were conducted in arid locations. The researchers said that further study is needed to determine the effect in more temperate climates.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/06/australia-breaks-more-solar-records/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 6, 2021",Australia breaks more solar records,"From pv magazine Australia
In case you were in need of a little mid-week pick me up, on the weekend Australian solar set two new records, with South Australian solar generating more electricity than the entire state needed, while the very next day rooftop solar plunged the national electricity market (NEM) to a new operational demand low, breaking the record it set just six weeks prior.
This new minimum operational demand meant there was little need for our coal generators to dispatch their energy on Sunday, further diminishing their profitability and sounding the death kneel.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) announced the news in a tweet, saying “the NEM broke through the 14,000 MW minimum operational demand level for the first time since Tasmania joined in 2006, setting a new record of 13,972 MW on Sunday, 221 MW below the August 2021 record.”
 
The August record it refers to happened on the 22th, also a Sunday, in which solar generated more electricity than coal for the first time in the history of our national energy market, providing 41.4% of demand.
This Sunday solar accounted for a little less at 34%, with the total renewable share at 55%.
But Saturday wasn’t going to let Sunday steal all the weekend’s glory, with South Australia setting its own record. Shortly after 11am, solar reached 106.1% of the state’s electricity demand, with the excess exported to Victoria.
Rooftop solar in particular that day met more than 88% of states electricity needs, another landmark whereby distributed systems on suburban homes output a remarkable 1134 MW
