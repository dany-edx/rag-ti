The company has signed an agreement with TBEA, which agreed to purchase 167 million new shares at a price of RMB13.73 per share. Xinte said around 87.22% of the funds will be invested into its ongoing poly-silicon expansion project in Inner Mongolia with a planned polysilicon output of 100,000 metric tons per year. The remaining funds will be used for working capital.
EVA solar film manufacturer Bbetter Century has revealed it wants to build an 8 GW EVA film in Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province. The total investment is estimated at around RMB500 million ($77.1M), and the production lines are expected to be commissioned in early 2022. Bbetter Century said the project would proceed in two separate phases. The first will commit RMB300 million for 5 lines of 4 GW capacity, and the second phase will add another 5 lines of 4 GW capacity. This project is intended as supplying solar module manufacturer Longi, which operates a module factory in the same city. Bbetter Century recently completed construction on another 28 GW EVA factory in Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province. The new Xianyang factory will be its fourth EVA film manufacturing facility, including that the company operates Vietnam.

German chemical company Wacker Chemie AG posted solid business results in the second quarter. In contrast to the same quarter of the previous year – when the effects of the corona pandemic depressed the numbers significantly – the company achieved a 40% sales increase with revenue reaching €1.5 billion. This result also improves the performance of the first quarter of the year by 10%.
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) reached €233.7 million, up 1.8% year-on-year and 51% quarter-on-quarter.
“The main reason for this strong growth was the significantly higher year-on-year sales volumes and prices for solar silicon,” said the company. For its polysilicon division, the company reported total sales of €352.9 million in the second quarter, more than double the figure for the same period last year. The EBITDA was €148.7 million euros – after a loss of 35 million euros in the second quarter of 2020. The main reasons for this increase were the higher prices for the polysilicon as well as efficiency measures in production and a reduction in manufacturing costs.
Overall, the management board confirmed the increase in the annual forecast that had already been announced in mid-June. Sales of around €5.5 billion euros are expected for the current financial year – after recording €4.69 billion euros in the previous year. EBITDA is expected to be between €900 million and €1.1 billion. “The continued good prices for polysilicon and strong demand in the chemical sectors are the reasons for the higher expectations,” said Wacker Chemie. Higher raw material prices and negative currency effects have been taken into account in the current forecast.
“We are on a very good course by the middle of the year and 2021 can be an excellent year for Wacker,” said CEO Christian Hartel. “Our polysilicon business developed particularly well. A key driver here is the high quality of our material for highly efficient solar cells and for the semiconductor industry, combined with very strong demand from our customers in a tight market. “

By providing CO2-free power without polluting our air, water, or soil, solar is uniquely virtuous among energy industries. But like all industries that involve people, consumers need to pay close attention to protect themselves.
Earlier this year, the California Public Utility Commission published a 24-page Solar Consumer Protection Guide. All homeowners must sign it before they are allowed to buy a solar powered project.
The document’s main purpose is to protect homeowners against aggressive door-to-door salespeople who push for digital signatures on handheld tablets. It advises customers against signing contracts before they have reached a comprehensive understanding of the project and its full implications.
Here at pv magazine USA, we believe the most important step in the Solar 101 series is finding the right contractor for your project. Step #3 of the California guide – “Find a qualified solar provider” – agrees with us.
The document effectively walks consumers through the pros and cons of different types of financing and leasing options. It is peppered with warnings against unscrupulous sales attempts to stretch the truth. It advises consumers to be particularly wary of “free solar power” offers. What does ‘”free” actually mean though?
 
Typically, “free solar” refers to a solar lease or power purchase agreement. In these kinds of arrangements, the homeowner agrees to trade their roof for a 10-30% reduction in electricity costs. The panels are owned and maintained by the lessor (not the homeowner). Keep in mind that your electricity bill will not go to zero if you install one of these third-part-owned systems.
Two other areas covered by the California document include making sure you compare your finance options and understanding how solar savings work.
Note that there are at least two negatives to taking on these “free solar” deals. First, you won’t gain all of the financial benefits that accrue if you actually own the system yourself. You’ll save 10-30% off of your electricity bill , but will lose out on tax credits and any state incentives.
Second, your home’s value won’t necessarily increase with the solar installation, because the system is owned by someone else. In fact, the added complication of a solar lease – including the need for an additional credit check – has the potential to deter some prospective home buyers.
And take note: Both federal and state laws stipulates a three-day cooling off period for those who have purchased products from door-to-door salespeople. Don’t be afraid to exercise your rights if you find yourself getting cold feet.
A second risk of solar power comes with new technology and new companies.
For instance, sometimes the hardware you want isn’t available when you want it, or the price you were originally quoted (and signed a contract for) is no longer valid.
Tesla’s Solar Roof is a beautiful product and its image may eventually represent the residential solar industry. However, the company has had challenges scaling the product for mass deployment, as well as meeting long-standing building material quality standards. This has led to some customers experiencing long wait periods, while others have had their purchases cancelled.
Additionally, some installations have taken weeks – versus a couple of days – to finish, as the company learns how to deploy the product. Lastly, some customers have complained about seeing the price of their project significantly increase, even after signing a contract at a specific dollar amount.
Selling newly minted technologies with innovative business models means that solar companies often take on advanced risk.
For example, this author installed a Solyndra solar panel plus Satcon solar inverter project in 2011. Shortly after installation, both companies went out of business. Fortunately, the hardware has been very reliable over the past decade. However, it has become challenging to find replacement modules when the occasional falling quahog clobbers a solar panel.
What’s more, solar installers can go out of business from time to time. There are thousands of installers across the nation, both large and small. That range of options offers yet another reason to meticulously consider your operations and maintenance contract before signing.
Like any other product, it’s important to pay attention to where your money is going. When accepting offers from door-to-door salespeople, take plenty of time before signing anything. Take time to research the many details involved in your solar purchase. Shop around before you drop thousands of dollars or lease your roof. When choosing companies and hardware, make a concerted effort to identify their limitations and fallibility.
Addressing a comprehensive list of questions on residential solar, pv magazine USA’s Solar 101 focuses on the tools and knowledge which will help consumers confidently answer their solar questions.

The acquisition is expected to be finalized by the end of August. Brookfield Business Partners noted in a quarterly earnings update that it acquired Aldo, and would fund “approximately $115 million of the $320 million equity investment for a 35% ownership interest, with the balance from institutional partners.”
Aldo said in a statement, “The transaction will enable the expansion of the company's national operations, the launch of new products and services, and the continuity of the mission to support the development of the distributed generation market in Brazil.”
The company said its turnover for 2020 amounted to 1.6 billion BRL ($308.8 million). “We were one of the first to believe in the solar sector in Brazil, we are pioneers in sustainability, and this transaction will help us go even further, expanding the offer to a market in full expansion,” said the company's founder and CEO, Aldo Pereira Teixeira.
In an interview with pv magazine in January, Pereira Teixeira explained the trajectory of the distributed generation segment, which in Brazil includes all PV systems not exceeding 5 MW in size. According to him, Brazil may see the deployment of 4 GW of new distributed generation solar capacity this year and another 5 GW next year.
Regarding the possibility of expanding the company's business abroad, Pereira Teixeira said that it would take at least 10 years for the Brazilian market to become saturated. “And until then, we want to continue growing and maintain our leadership here,” he commented at the time. “Brazil is still taking its first steps in solar energy.”

Today, Gazprom Neft already produces more than 100 thousand tons of hydrogen at its technological sites, and the plans are to reach 250 thousand tons by 2024,” reads a statement published on Tuesday. So far, Gazprom Neft has not considered hydrogen a final product, but an agent for oil refining. The company is also teaming up with the Government of Serbia to deploy carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies in the Balkan country. Over the last six years, the third-largest oil producer in Russia has been involved in projects for capturing carbon dioxide and injecting it into oil reservoirs to maintain reservoir pressure and increase oil recovery. “Such technologies are now being successfully applied at the Rusanda field by NIS in Serbia, a joint venture between Gazprom Neft and the Government of Serbia,” reads the note, showing how Russian oil and gas companies see hydrogen and CCU technologies as simultaneous, symbiotic developments.
Italy-based shipbuilding company Fincantieri and Enel Green Power Italia, the renewable energy unit of Italian energy company Enel, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to develop an integrated solution for the production, supply, management, and use of green hydrogen for port areas and long-range maritime transport. The deal proved once more that collaborations will be central for the hydrogen industry. “The signing of this agreement represents a further step forward in Enel Green Power's commitment to collaborating with operators interested in developing solutions for the use of green hydrogen in sectors where electrification is not possible,” commented Carlo Zorzoli, Head of Business Development for Enel Green Power. Likewise, Fincantieri is strengthening ties with industrial partners. “The European goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 requires the creation of an industrial eco-system on which Fincantieri has been working concretely for some time through a series of operational agreements with the major Italian players for the realization of complex projects in a short time,” said Laura Luigia Martini, Executive Vice President Corporate Business Development of Fincantieri. The two companies said they would evaluate the possibility of collaborating in the supply of green hydrogen to naval, submarine, and surface vessels while also teaming up with industrial users within the port area. Enel's Eugenio Montale power plant in La Spezia (Liguria region) will be the initial test site for the activities covered by the agreement. Last month, Fincantieri teamed up with Swiss-based shipping company MSC and gas transmission operator Snam for the “world's first oceangoing hydrogen-powered cruise ship.” Europe's largest utility joined forces with several companies, including Italy's oil refining operator Saras.
According to BloombergNEF, over the last six months, the clean hydrogen industry doubled on strong infrastructure investments from the EU, UK, Canada, and China. The investments are set to continue in the short to medium term. China should account for 60-63% of global installations in 2022, capitalizing on its carbon neutrality target and related policies to stimulate clean H2 demand. CO2 prices will be central for widespread hydrogen adoption for the rest of the world, as demand still lags behind electrolyzer makers' aggressive capacity expansion plans. These are two key messages of the outlook published by BloombergNEF on Thursday. “Nearly everything has doubled already this year in the world of clean hydrogen, and we expect the momentum to continue in the months ahead… Electricity generators have almost doubled their planned hydrogen-fired turbine capacity since January,” commented Martin Tengler, lead hydrogen analyst at BloombergNEF. The 2H 2021 Hydrogen Market Outlook reports that more than 40 countries have now published a hydrogen strategy or are developing one, but China remains the most promising country. “What's happening in China right now is revolutionary for clean hydrogen. Chinese companies are racing to show their compliance with the country's carbon neutrality target, pushing the market for electrolyzers… to be at least nine times bigger in 2022 than in 2020.” Despite weakness on the demand side, electrolyzer shipments are forecasted to double in 2021 and quadruple in 2022. A total of 16GW of manufacturing capacity could come online by 2024, benefitting from the growing government funding.
Iceland's geothermal power company HS Orka and UK-based Hydrogen Ventures Limited (H2V) announced plans to develop a production plant for green methanol using green hydrogen to power the marine sector, as well as domestic and commercial vehicles such as cars, vans, and lorries. “Iceland has set itself ambitious targets for reducing its carbon emissions and we believe harnessing the power of hydrogen is crucial in achieving them. With its history of utilizing renewable energy, Iceland is leading the way,” commented H2V's Chief Executive Officer Horacio Carvalho. The project will comprise two phases, with an initial 30MW input, followed by a second phase at a much larger scale. “The total cost of Phase One is anticipated to be €100m.” HS Orka will supply electricity, fresh water and natural carbon dioxide.
UK-based oil and energy company BP agreed on Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with potential customers for its proposed clean hydrogen production facility in Teesside in northeast England. New clients include ammonia producer CF Fertilisers, chemical company Mitsubishi Chemical and infrastructure company Sembcorp Energy UK. “These companies are seeking to decarbonize existing operations in Teesside by switching fuel from natural gas to clean hydrogen,” reads the note released on Thursday. BP is also teaming up with Saudi Arabia's Alfanar to scope the supply of clean hydrogen to Alfanar's waste-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant, currently under development in Teesside. “Today's announcement demonstrates the diverse range of companies and industries that can benefit from clean hydrogen,” commented Louise Jacobsen Plutt, BP's senior vice president of hydrogen and CCUS. BP's H2Teesside facility aims to produce up to 1GW of blue hydrogen, 20% of the UK's hydrogen target by 2030.
The government of Colombia published its hydrogen roadmap, launching on Wednesday a 12-day consultation. “Industrial demand will be the first to develop, motivated by the decarbonization of processes that currently consume hydrogen in Colombia: fuel refining and fertilizer production. On the other hand, demand from the transport sector should start from 2026, mainly in heavy land transport (buses and trucks),” reads the document in the chapters on the demand side. The South American country also set a hydrogen target in the industrial sector. “Consumption of 40% low-emission hydrogen in the industrial sector with respect to the total hydrogen consumed in the sector, considering both the consumption of hydrogen as a raw material and its use as an energy source.” The 49-page Colombian strategy suggests that blue and green hydrogen will play a vital role in 2030-2040. “Starting in 2035, blue H2 (from coal gasification or NG reforming) would be even more competitive than gray H2 due to rising CO2 prices and lower costs of capture technologies,” reads the document. Things will change in 2040, as green hydrogen is expected to “become the most competitive alternative throughout the Colombian territory.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/06/ever-heard-of-photovoltachromics-the-new-tech-for-solar-windows/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 6, 2021","Ever heard of photovoltachromics, the new tech for solar windows?","Photovoltachromic devices (PVCDs) are capable of enabling adjustable transparency glazing and, at the same time, generate electricity by means of the PV effect. This technology has been so far applied to the design of self-powered smart windows for buildings and vehicles at research level and, however, it is still at a very early stage of development. The ability to modulate indoor light and heat transmission, while generating energy from PVs, is enticing for further BIPV developments.
Researchers in China have now taken a further step by developing a solar window based on a photovoltachromic device that combines a full-transparent perovskite photovoltaic device and electrochromic components based on ion-gel in a vertical tandem architecture without any intermediated electrode.
“This full-transparent monolithic smart window possesses not only full advantages of self-power, on-demand control and self-adaptive based on solar-irradiances, but also good features including excellent visible transparency and color neutrality, high adjustable range on transmittance and temperature, as well as repeatable serviceability,” the scientists stated
The Chinese group used visibly transparent perovskite and flexible electrochromic ion-gel to connect two terminals of PV element and two terminals of the electrochemical element in a four-terminal configuration. The perovskite layer was based on hybrid methylamine lead chloride (MAPbCl3) perovskite film prepared by a spin coating method.
The monolithic PVCD device was assembled via a full solution process in an architecture incorporating glass, a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) layer, the perovskite-based PV cell, the electrochromic gel, another FTO layer, and glass. This design, according to the researchers, offers the possibility of building large-area devices with a surface of approximately 36 cm2. The electrochromic gel has a thickness of around  90 μm and the PV component of around 800 nm. The PV module consists of a 300 nm electron transport layer (ETL), a 350 nm perovskite layer, and a 40 nm hole-transport layer (HTL). When the PVCD is hit by sunlight, the PV module provides voltage to charge the electrochromic module.
“By optimizing the halide-diffusion period for perovskite, we successfully achieved a self-adaptable adjustment on transmittances depending on varying solar irradiation intensities for this monolithic PVCD,” the study reads. The PVCD is claimed to achieve a high pristine transmittance up to 76% and to be self-adaptable to control indoor brightness and temperature automatically depending on different solar irradiances.
A full description of the device can be found in the paper Full-frame and high-contrast smart windows from halide-exchanged perovskites, which was recently published in Nature Communications. The research group includes scientists from China's Nanjing Tech University and the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

Be Power currently operates, through its unit Be Charge, over 5,000 charging stations across the country.
“The acquisition of Be Power will allow Eni gas e luce to become a primary operator of electric vehicle charging on public land, on private land with public access and in Eni service stations, in Italy and abroad,” Eni said in a statement. 
Be Charge also operates stations of other unspecified operators through a proprietary technology platform and provides charging services to drivers of electric vehicles on its own or third-party charging stations through a dedicated app.

Stationary storage within battery-enabled storage systems (BESS) is set to witness significant growth over the next ten years according to a recent report by India-based consultancy firm Praxis Global Alliance. This growth will be led by lithium-ion technology as battery prices decline at an average 6% annually between 2018-30,
The report authors made a reference to IEA’s projections that India would lead the battery storage market and contribute 35% of the total global battery deployment for energy storage by 2040. The Indian stationary storage requirement is expected to grow nine times at 22% annually during FY2022-32, as per a report by India Smart Grid Forum. The key factors driving this growth are robust solar energy generation targets and end-user demand towards green energy transition.
The Praxis report projects lithium-ion technology to lead the Indian battery energy storage systems market by 2030 due to a decline in battery prices for both lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP) and Lithium, Nickel, Cobalt, and Manganese (NCM) batteries, the two most commonly used lithium-ion battery technologies.
The overall battery price decline by 2030 is expected to be about US$ 80/kWh for LFP and about US$ 100/kWh for NCM. Further, the total cost of ownership (TCO) is expected to almost halve from current levels for both Lithium-ion battery technologies.
The cost economics of solar power and battery storage on account of the falling prices will result in the LFP batteries’ tariff for electricity to range between INR 7.0–INR 7.7 per kWh (US$ 0.09 – US$ 0.10) by 2030, while NCM battery tariffs are expected to range between INR 7.8–INR 8.7 per kWh (US$ 0.10 – US$ 0.12).
In their report, Praxis analysts also looked at the electricity storage technologies used globally and the application of BESS. They suggested that utility-scale and end-consumer models existing globally for battery storage could be replicated in India as battery prices decline. The use case for commercial and industrial consumers to replace diesel gen-sets is already available today.
Aryaman Tandon, Managing Partner and co-founder, Praxis Global Alliance, said, “Battery storage would lead India’s march towards net-zero targets in this decade, with global battery prices declining significantly. The improving economics with a declining total cost of ownership (TCO) and favorable government policies will result in increasing battery storage manufacturing and adoption in India.”
Savio Monteiro, Senior Vice President, Energy, Oil & Gas and Utilities, Praxis Global Alliance, said, “The decline in Lithium-ion battery storage prices over the next few years would make green energy affordable at both residential, commercial & industrial levels as well as at grid level and has the potential to replace fossil fuels significantly. We would witness increasing use cases and newer business models evolving as the overall battery storage cost declines over the next ten years.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/06/australian-energy-market-operator-points-to-inverters-as-possible-path-to-100-renewables/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 6, 2021",Australian Energy Market Operator points to inverters as possible path to 100% renewables,"From pv magazine Australia
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has published a ‘white paper’ aiming to accelerate the introduction of grid-scale inverters to support Australia’s future power system as it transitions from synchronous generation towards inverter-based resources (IBR) such as solar PV, wind energy, and battery energy storage systems (BESS).
The Application of Advanced Grid-scale Inverters in the NEM paper outlines how the shift from synchronous generation towards IBR is changing the way the industry must plan for the secure operation of the National Electricity Market (NEM).
AEMO said this includes developing a power system capable of running at 100% instantaneous penetration of renewable energy, including grid-scale solar, wind, hydro and rooftop PV.
AEMO future energy systems manager Chris Davies said the engineering white paper focuses on the potential of advanced grid-scale inverter technology to support the operation of the NEM as the penetration of IBR increases, particularly through the use of grid-forming capabilities that can help stabilize the grid.
“The NEM is undergoing a once-in-a-lifetime transition from synchronous generation, such as thermal and hydro, to variable inverter-based renewable generation,” he said.
“When offline or decommissioned, synchronous generators can no longer provide the critical system stability capabilities that the grid relies on, requiring these capabilities be provided by different technologies.
“AEMO has been working with stakeholders to understand the potential of grid-forming inverters to address many of the challenges facing the future power system.”
The supply of electricity in the NEM has historically been dominated by large, fossil-fuel-fired synchronous generators. The design of the NEM was based on the capabilities provided by synchronous generation but the network has undergone transformational change in its generation mix with IBR including wind and solar being deployed at a scale and pace not seen anywhere else in the world.

AEMO said some regions of the NEM are leading the world in demonstrating operation of a gigawatt-scale power system with low levels of synchronous generation. Figures provided by the market operator show South Australia and Tasmania have recorded periods with 93% and 82% IBR generation respectively.
While the generation mix in the NEM is changing, the physics that determine the grid’s secure operation remain the same, meaning the attributes provided by synchronous generation will continue to be required during periods of high IBR penetration.
Davies said advanced inverter technology may be able to address many of the challenges facing the NEM today for the integration of renewable resources but warned that at present this potential is not demonstrated at the necessary scale, and focused engineering development is urgently needed to address the remaining issues and realize the promise of this technology.
“To realise the potential of this technology, we need to quickly come together as an industry to prioritize the time and resources needed to prove this technology at scale and support an effective transition,” he said.
The paper identifies four key areas of application for advanced inverters, including connecting IBR in weak grids, supporting system security, island operation, and system restart.

Developed as part of AEMO’s Engineering Framework, the paper recommends prioritizing the deployment of grid-forming capabilities on grid-scale battery energy storage systems, saying the technology provides capability to deliver firm, flexible energy behind the inverter.
AEMO said with a growing number of grid-scale batteries committed or proposed on the NEM, there is a rare window of opportunity to build grid-forming capabilities into this battery fleet today.
This would enable testing and demonstration of these capabilities at scale and begin to build a fleet that can support the power system as it transitions to high IBR penetrations.
While large, standalone BESS provides one way to deliver grid-forming capability, AEMO also suggested smaller batteries coupled to variable renewable energy (VRE) plant might also provide a flexible resource mix to cater for the applications described in the paper.
AEMO said further collaboration with stakeholders will be needed to develop effective pathways toward the application of advanced inverters and it will continue to work with the industry to identify additional priority actions needed to prepare the future power system.

At least 226 co-located hybrid front-of-the-meter power plants greater than 1 MW in size were operating in the United States at the end of 2020, according to data tracked by the Energy Department’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The total installed capacity topped 30 GW.
Based on Form EIA-860 data, the most common configuration is PV + storage (73 projects totaling 992 MW of solar and 250 MW storage), followed by several fossil-based hybrid categories.
Co-located or hybrid power plants–namely, ones that integrate energy storage on-site with power generation sources, or that co-locate two or more different types of generation–have been part of the U.S. energy mix for years. The dominant trend today is to combine solar PV plants with batteries.
Interconnection queue data from across the country that is tracked by LBNL show a strong commercial interest in hybrid power plants. At the close of 2020, there were more than 460 GW of solar plants in the interconnection queues. Of that, 159 GW, or 35%, was classified as hybrid, typically a solar-plus-battery configuration. For the 209 GW of wind in interconnection queues, roughly 6% of projects were proposed as hybrids, with most of those paired with battery storage. 

Solar installations generally spur higher battery attachment rates, as the projects in interconnection had median storage to generation capacity ratio of 60% for solar, and 35% for wind. Solar also had the longest median-duration storage attached, at about 2 hours.
Almost 93% of all hybrid projects in the interconnection queue were solar + battery, representing 88% of the total hybrid capacity. Proposed solar plus battery capacity accounted for more than seven times the combined generator capacity of all other proposed hybrid configurations.
California’s grid CAISO saw the highest rate of solar projects with batteries included, with 89%. That was followed by the West non-ISO territories at 67%, and then the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and Electric Reliability Corporation of Texas (ERCOT) regions at 22% and 21%, respectively.
In general, the west has shown a greater interest in such projects, as eastern grids including NYISO, ISO-NE, and PJM had hybrid project rates of 5%, 12%, and 19%, respectively.
CAISO data suggest co-location models are more popular than a true hybrid approach. Co-location entails distinct modeling and dispatch instructions for individual resources behind shared interconnection. Hybrid models use a single bidding approach for multiple resourced behind shared interconnection, meaning there is no separate renewable resource forecast and dispatch. Most of the CAISO capacity planned through 2024 falls under this category, shown in the figure to the left.
Berkeley Labs also tracked PV+battery plants with offtake agreements to get a better view of the near-term hybrid pipeline. A sample of 134 projects showed a trend toward longer duration storage and higher battery-to-PV capacity ratios than in currently existing hybrid plants.
Overall weighted-average battery duration of these new offtaker-secured projects was 3.4 hours, with a battery-to PV-capacity ratio of 50%. These numbers were higher than for existing projects, which had an average duration of 2.6 hours and a 25% storage-capacity ratio. Most of the upcoming battery capacity of these projects were in California, Nevada, Texas, and Hawaii.
Based on a review of power purchase agreements, Berkeley Labs found that the cost of adding storage increases linearly with the battery-to-PV capacity ratio, and that overall PPA prices have declined over time, even with the increase of battery-to-PV capacity ratio. This trend held everywhere but in Hawaii, where PV projects often have a 100% storage capacity ratio, and storage-coupled projects come at a premium.
