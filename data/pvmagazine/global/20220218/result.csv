Ivory Coast's state-owned energy company Côte d'Ivoire Energies (CI-Energies) has launched a tender for the construction of a floating solar power plant and the associated transmission network.
The 20 MWp will be located on the retention lake of the Kossou dam, in the center of Ivory Coast.
Interested developers will have time until March 29 to submit their bids.
The project is being financed by French Development Agency (AFD) with an €80 million loan.
Ivory Coast aims to double its power generation capacity between 2025 and 2030, increasing from 2,229 to 4,663 MW in 2030, including 42% renewable energy. The Ivorian government is planning to meet increasing energy demand by adding around 150 MW per year through IPPs, according to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Sub-Saharan country had only 13 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2020.

Recently, IRENA ranked the project as the largest giga-scale renewable hydrogen project globally. Anchor sponsors include international steel manufacturing corporation ArcelorMittal, Spanish gas transmission system operator Enagás, Spain’s chemical group Fertiberia and Madrid-based hydrogen company DH2 Energy. Production is planned to start in 2025; the total installed capacity is expected to reach 9.5 GW of solar power and 7.4 GW of electrolyzers by 2030. ArcelorMittal and Grupo Fertiberia plan to purchase 6.6 million tons of renewable hydrogen over 20 years to produce steel, ammonia, and fertilizers. “HyDeal España is the first concrete implementation of the €1.5/kg green hydrogen system announced in February 2021,” commented Thierry Lepercq, chairman of the joint venture and spokesperson for HyDeal Ambition, adding that green hydrogen can now compete with coal, oil and natural gas in both costs and volumes. Spanish authorities have repeatedly said that the European Union should try to avoid importing green hydrogen in the future, giving priority to local production.
Scientists from the University of Tsukuba in Japan presented a new technique for detecting when a hydrogen fuel cell is experiencing reduced efficiency due to periods of excess or insufficient water. “By using sensors that measure magnetic flux density, the amount of current generated can be monitored noninvasively, which can signal a problem. This work may lead to technology that can improve the reliability of fuel cells, while also significantly reducing the carbon footprint of cars,” reads the press release written by the university, which explains that the research particularly targeted PEM fuel cells. The team tested their system with an air-cooled 50 W PEMFC stack consisting of five fuel cells. The magnetic flux density was measured using sensors that were placed inside cooling holes. The team published their work in the specialized journal Fuel Cells.
India wants to produce 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030, the government said on Thursday, proposing the creation of manufacturing zones for green hydrogen and ammonia. The Indian ministry of power explained that national institutions should grant a waiver of inter-state transmission charges for 25 years to the green hydrogen and green ammonia projects commissioned before June 2025. In its 12-point green hydrogen policy communication, the ministry also said that green hydrogen facilities shall be granted priority connection to electric grids. The government is expected to announce more details of its strategy in the next months. Meanwhile, India’s Reliance Industries announced a blue hydrogen project in Gujarat. The conglomerate is owned by Mukesh Ambani.
Brazil defined its first environmental licenses for green hydrogen generation earlier this month, establishing procedures, criteria, and parameters. The development was brought forward by the State Council of Ceará (Coema). The 277.35 MWp Morada do Sol – Usina de Geração de Energia Solar Photovoltaic Complex project was also approved. It will be located in the city of Aquiraz, and is being promoted by a company of the same name, of which no further details were provided.
European aerospace corporation Airbus, Italy’s gas transmission system operator Snam and the operator of Venice’s airport, SAVE, have signed a memorandum of understanding to promote the use of hydrogen as a sustainable energy carrier in the airport and air transport sectors. “The engineering and design studies under the agreement will include the technological infrastructure needed to refuel both aircraft and airport vehicles with hydrogen,” the three companies wrote on Tuesday. In an interview with CNBC, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury underlined the importance of decarbonizing the aviation sector “at the right pace” and described hydrogen planes as the “ultimate solution.”
Italy’s Ministry of Ecological Transition is expected to soon sign a program agreement with the National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA) for research and development activities on hydrogen. The agreement provides for a maximum contribution of €110 million through European funds.
Vancouver-based First Hydrogen entered into a research and collaboration agreement for an initial five-year period with the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. The collaboration will focus on the joint development of hydrogen-related technologies with a particular focus on the automotive industry, hydrogen production, and fuel distribution industries. “The initial project which First Hydrogen will be developing with the university is an AI software learning tool to harvest user and supplier information related to hydrogen usage to better inform hydrogen business cases and help direct the significant investments into hydrogen mobility and related infrastructure,” wrote First Hydrogen on Wednesday. 
US-based technology developer ZoneFlow Reactor Technologies has been granted a US patent for its Bayonet Reactor. “The reactor's innovative design promises to drive down the cost of hydrogen production significantly, further strengthening the resource's viability as an alternative for fossil fuel use,” the company wrote on Wednesday. The technology includes the use of excess heat in syngas (a mixture of heated hydrogen and other byproducts) to create more hydrogen. “Recirculating syngas through the Bayonet Reactor transfers the heat in the syngas to the cooler reactant gases entering the reactor, contributing 15% – 20% of the heat required for hydrogen production.” The Connecticut-based company expects to test the commercial version in 2022 in collaboration with Illinois-based engineering company Honeywell UOP.
Austrian energy company Energie Steiermark will utilize a PEM Electrolyser ME450/1400 from H-tec Systems to generate green hydrogen, directly used for vehicles or fed into the grid. The company expects the electrolyzer to go into operation as early as mid-2022. The green hydrogen will also be used in the region’s industry. For instance, a mining company from the Austrian region of Styria will be supplied with up to 70 tons of hydrogen annually from the plant.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/18/flexible-pv-panels-based-on-hyperconnected-back-contact-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 18, 2022",Flexible PV panels based on hyperconnected back-contact solar cells,"US-based start-up mPower Technology, a spin-off of the Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories, has developed a flexible monocrystalline silicon solar module technology, called DragonScales, which it claims can be used for both space and terrestrial applications.
“Our main business is expected to be in the space solar cell segment,” the company's president and CEO, Kevin Hell , told pv magazine. “But we are also planning to enter the building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) business, as our products could be easily used for residential and commercial projects, and to produce solar modules for soldier portable and shelter power applications.”
The fully encapsulated modules are fabricated with conventional back contact silicon solar cells with a thickness of 150 um or less and are assembled using existing high-volume fabrication processes from the microelectronics industry. “Our pilot line is a conventional machine for the production of semiconductors that has been adapted to the manufacturing of our flexible solar modules,” mPower CTO Murat Okandan stated. “The panels can be customized according to the customers' needs and adapted to different applications.”
According to the manufacturer, its production equipment can produce very high volumes of modules and allow rapid scaling as needed by the customers and applications for space.
The back-contact solar panels consist of micro-singulated silicon dies that are “hyper-interconnected” in series or in parallel. According to the company, the design allows customization of its “super modules” to any shape, thickness, voltage, size, material stack, and other design considerations to meet application-specific requirements at the lowest cost.
The modules feature efficiencies ranging from 22 to 23% and temperature coefficients spanning from 0.4 to 0.27 percent per degree Celsius, depending on the size or applications. Since the interconnect design is very customizable, it is possible to provide high voltage/low current or other desired array configuration details to fit the desired physical footprint and achieve the highest possible power delivery, the company stated.  This is also claimed to bring in a very high level of innate electrical and mechanical resilience at the system level.
This approach, according to the manufacturer, leverages the massive scale and high power of the terrestrial silicon PV market to minimize cost, while eliminating the challenging, hard-to-scale models of custom cell manufacturing.
“Our products are more expensive than conventional PV panels, but they are three to five times less expensive than III-V modules based on gallium arsenide for applications in space,” Hell further explained. “They are also significantly lighter since they are flexible and thus require less structural materials.”
At the beginning of February, mPower raised $10 million in a Series B financing round. The funds will be used to scale up the company's manufacturing facility and integration and test facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and to further develop the cell technology.
The production line currently has a capacity of 100 kW and the company plans to expand it to 1.5 MW.  The yearly volume is projected to reach around 50 MW by 2025.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has launched a two-year process to evaluate paths for Puerto Rico to reach 100% renewables.
NREL’s base case for its computer modeling will reflect the renewable generation milestones set by Puerto Rico’s Act 17: 20% renewable generation by 2022, 40% by 2025, 60% by 2040, and 100% by 2050.
Within six months, NREL aims to achieve “a highly involved stakeholder group” to help identify initial scenarios that may be evaluated “to achieve Puerto Rico’s goals,” said the study’s co-principal investigator Murali Baggu.
The study process will aim for “equitable access to the planning process and benefit,” said Baggu. Modeling of generation options will include distributed generation, he said.
Both of Puerto Rico’s utilities, generation utility PREPA and transmission and distribution utility Luma Energy, are represented on the study’s steering committee. NREL will work closely with the utilities to ensure that study results may be used in their planning processes, including PREPA’s next resource plan, said an NREL spokesperson. A PREPA engineer said the utility looked forward to the study’s guidance on how PREPA may make electrical system investments in the most efficient sequence.
The Solar + Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico (SESA) and the utilities are represented on an advisory committee that includes academics, municipal officials and civic group representatives.
NREL reported that Puerto Rico has 20GW of utility-scale solar potential, mostly along the coasts, and 20GW of distributed solar potential. Just 10GW of solar could meet Puerto Rico’s needs, as estimated by SESA President PJ Wilson.
NREL will also examine the potential for onshore and offshore wind, storage, and hydropower.
SESA’s Chief Policy Officer Javier Rúa said the study “represents the commitment that we’ve seen by the Biden administration and the agencies to help Puerto Rico fulfill its self-legislated goal to 100 percent renewables.” Wilson expects the study will be “a big step towards every Puerto Rican having solar and storage and completely resilient power during the next hurricane.”
In opening remarks, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said the study represents “the latest effort in our administration’s partnership with Puerto Rico to seize the enormous opportunity of clean energy. It’s not just about making the air cleaner, it’s also about creating jobs, installing renewables across the island, and lowering energy costs for Puerto Ricans.”
An analysis last year from nonprofit groups Cambio and IEEFA concluded that distributed solar and storage could provide 75% of Puerto Rico’s power.
Earlier this month, PREPA submitted 18 solar projects totaling 845MW to the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau. The bureau approved those projects, and they are now awaiting approval from Puerto Rico’s Financial Oversight and Management Board.
NREL said that its webinar on the 100% study drew 550 participants. Five other national laboratories are assisting in the study. NREL previously completed a 100% renewables study for Los Angeles.

The facility will be China's first utility-scale solar project integrating perovskite solar modules, the company said in a statement. The plant is expected to be built with an investment of approximately RMB60 million ($9.48 million) and to occupy a surface of 166,500 square meters. Microquanta currently produces its modules through a 100 MW production line at its facility in Hangzhou Province. In 2019, its research team achieved a 14.24% conversion efficiency record for a large-area (200 x 800 cm2) perovskite solar module. In May, it claimed a world record 20.2% conversion efficiency on a 20 cm2, “third generation” solar cell. The highest efficiency for a company's solar cell with an area of 19.3 cm2 is reportedly 24.1%
Shanghai-listed Haiyuan Material (HYM) announced in a Q&A with investors on Wednesday that it expects to commission its 600 MW heterojunction solar cell factory in July. The company said it will be able to produce 24.5% efficient solar cells at a costs of RMB1 ($0.16) per watt. The company is owned by Gan Shengquan, which is also the owner of solar manufacturer LDK.
Polysilicon supplier Daqo is seeking to raise RMB11 billion ($1.74 billion) through a private placement. The company plans to issue more than 577.5 million shares to 35 investors. The net proceeds will be used for a plan aimed at further expanding the manufacturer's capacity by another 100,000 MTs. The new capacity will be located in Inner Mongolia to serve its customers which also have downstream productivities nearby. Those customers include Longi, JA Solar, Shangji, and Shuangliang, among others.
Renewables developer Beijing Enterprises Clean Energy yesterday announced it had abandoned plans to spin off its Tianjin Beiqing Electric Smart Energy Co Ltd solar and wind project development business for a listing in Shanghai via a complex asset swap with SEC Electric Machinery Co Ltd. The arrangement would have seen the Beijing Smart unit incorporated into Shanghai-listed SEC, which itself would have become an indirect, non-wholly owned subsidiary of BE Clean Energy. The latter company said the deal, announced in March last year, had lapsed because the appropriate stock market spin-off and listing approvals had not been achieved.
TBEA-owned polysilicon manufacturer and solar developer Xinte Energy on Wednesday announced it had signed a cooperation agreement with machine parts manufacturer Shanxi Huaxiang Group Co Ltd and the Hongtong County government to develop a RMB4 billion ($631 million), 1 GW solar project and a RMB300 million ($47.3 million) factory to produce PV mounting system brackets. The local authority will provide permitting support. The investment cost split between the two partner companies is yet to be determined.
State-owned energy company China Resources Power Holdings on Wednesday published generation figures which showed the 101 GWh its solar fields generated last month was 65% more than the 61.3 GWh of solar electricity it produced a year earlier. The company also generated 14.2 TWh of thermal power in January, up 3.4% year on year.

India has unveiled its green hydrogen policy as a step towards meeting the objectives of the National Hydrogen Mission launched by the prime minister last year. 
The National Hydrogen Mission aims to make India a green hydrogen hub, enabling the nation to meet its climate targets while reducing its fossil fuel import bills. It targets the production of 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 and the related development of renewable energy capacity.
Hydrogen plays a critical role in the Indian economy, with roughly 6 million tons of hydrogen consumed annually, primarily in ammonia and methanol production and for use in refineries. A report from the Energy and Resources Institute estimates that demand for hydrogen could grow to as much as 28 million tons by 2050. 
Virtually all the hydrogen consumed in India today is grey (hydrogen produced using fossil fuels), the production of which emits roughly 9 tons of CO2 per ton of hydrogen. Therefore, enabling cost-effective domestic production of green hydrogen (utilizing renewable electricity) is critical for India to reduce the carbon intensity of heavy industry and help achieve its energy security and emissions targets.
With hydrogen and ammonia envisaged as the future fuels, the government is determined to facilitate their production using renewable sources of electricity instead of fossil fuels/fossil fuel-based feedstocks.
The policy is designed to promote the production of green hydrogen and green ammonia by easing the process of RE purchase, storage, and transmission for the manufacturers. 
Green hydrogen/ammonia manufacturers can purchase renewable power from the power exchange or set up renewable energy capacity themselves or through any other developer anywhere. For such plants, open access will be granted within 15 days of receipt of application. They can bank their unconsumed renewable power, for up to 30 days, with the distribution company and take it back when required.
Distribution licensees can also procure and supply renewable energy to the manufacturers of green hydrogen/green ammonia in their states at concessional prices, which will only include the cost of procurement, wheeling charges, and a small margin as determined by the State Commission.
Further, green hydrogen and green ammonia manufacturers shall be allowed a 25-year waiver of inter-state transmission charges for the projects commissioned before June 30, 2025. ISTS connectivity for the renewable energy capacity set up to manufacture green hydrogen/green ammonia shall be granted priority.
Hydrogen and ammonia producers and distribution licensees will be eligible for incentive benefits from the renewable purchase obligation (RPO) for the consumption of renewable power.
Among other measures, the ministry of new and renewable energy is setting up a single portal to carry out all the activities, including statutory clearances, in a time-bound manner.
Green hydrogen and green ammonia producers will be allowed to set up bunkers near ports for storage of green ammonia for export and use by the shipping sector. The land for the storage for this purpose shall be provided by the respective port authorities at applicable charges.
To further encourage the usage of green hydrogen by industries, the fuel has been included under RPO regulations.

Photonic crystals are periodic dielectric structures that are ideal for light-harvesting applications in photovoltaics, as they have a bandgap that forbids propagation of a certain frequency range of light, which increases the photon path length, especially for high wavelengths.
“The ‘practical efficiency limit' of silicon single-junction cells with poly-Si on oxide contacts for both polarities – best placed on the rear side to minimize shading and parasitic absorption – is over 27%,” Robby Peibst, the research project's corresponding author, told pv magazine. “The improved light trapping promised by photonic crystals could enable even higher efficiencies.”
The simulated cell was assumed to rely on a standard wafer thickness of 150 μm and the scientists found it may achieve an efficiency of over 28% under normal incident light. “Since Maxwell equations predict the formation of optical modes parallel to the surface, the optics are rather independent of the wafer thickness,” Peibst explained. “The latter could therefore be reduced strongly, which also reduces extrinsic and intrinsic recombination losses in the wafer.”
The German group also investigated how improving the hydrogenation process of the POLO junctions by a rear-side dielectric layer stack made of aluminum oxide and silicon nitride (Al2O3/SiNx/Al2O3) may further raise the device's efficiency for the same standard thickness. This configuration was found to have the potential to reach an efficiency of up to 29.1%. “Even without photon crystals, an efficiency potential of 27.8% is predicted for the improved surface passivation quality on 150 μm-thick wafers,” the scientists stated.
“The transfer of the concept of photonic crystals into PV is at a very early stage,” Peibst explained. Although there is no doubt of the Maxwell equations and photonic crystals have already been commercialized for other applications, their benefit has not been demonstrated so far at the solar cell level, he added. “We are now planning to investigate concerns like angular dependency and the effect of spectral variations experimentally.”
According to him, another important step would be the development of an industrially feasible and cheap method for the fabrication of photonic crystals even on saw-damaged etched surfaces. “So far, photonic crystals are fabricated by various lithography techniques,” he stated. “However, their targeted size for application on the front side of solar cells of around 1-3µm is also realizable with other techniques that can be considered cheap enough for PV.”
As for the cost of solar cells based on photonic crystals, it would be the same as for high-efficiency premium cells. “The costs are so far higher than for standard PERC modules, but they can probably come down further by scaling effects, and in particular by emerging inexpensive metallization schemes such as non-alloying Al pastes for contacting of the poly-Si,” Peibst added, noting that these cells may find ideal applications in rooftop solar and vehicle-integrated photovoltaics.
The solar cell was introduced in the study Towards 28 %-efficient Si single-junction solar cells with better passivating POLO junctions and photonic crystals, published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. The research group includes scientists from the Leibniz Universität Hannover and the Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH).

New Emergency Solar Management rules have been introduced in Western Australia (WA), as the state grapples with the rapid transition of its power system from one dominated by large-scale, synchronous, thermal generation to one featuring increasing amounts of distributed energy resources (DER), including rooftop solar PV.
The WA energy sector has undergone unprecedented change in recent years with households embracing renewable energy technology at record rates with approximately 3,000 homes installing rooftop solar each month.
New figures released by the government show that in 2021, WA households added 191 MW of generation capacity to their rooftops, bringing the total amount of residential solar capacity in the state’s main grid to more than 1.35 GW.
That collective capacity means rooftop solar is the largest cumulative generator in the state, far outstripping the capacity of Synergy’s 854 MW coal-fired Muja Power Station.
More than 400,000 WA homes and businesses, about 36% of customers, now have rooftop solar connected to the South West Interconnected System (SWIS).
WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston said while the uptake of renewable technologies provides the opportunity for Western Australians to enjoy low cost and low emissions electricity, the intermittent and uncontrolled nature of these energy sources is presenting challenges to maintain the security, reliability and affordability of the power system.

“Over the past 10 years, rooftop solar has increased by over 600%, with 50% of Western Australian households expected to have solar panels by 2030,” he said.
“These rapid changes to the energy landscape have presented a range of challenges and opportunities, which we are addressing to ensure electricity remains affordable and reliable.”
Johnston said to enable the continued uptake of rooftop solar panels on homes and avoid blackouts, the government has introduced a range of policies, products and initiatives including the new Emergency Solar Management rules which come into effect on 14 February 2022.
The new rules will give network operators the capacity to remotely switch off residential solar systems as an emergency grid stability mechanism. The measures will apply to all new and upgraded solar PV and battery installations with an inverter capacity of 5kW or less.
The mechanism is to only be used as a “last resort” measure when demand for electricity reaches a critically low level and could affect the stability of the SWIS.
The state government said the changes will apply to those installing a new rooftop solar system 5 kW or less, and to those upgrading an existing rooftop solar system to 5 kW or under from 14 February 2022. They will also apply to those customers adding a battery, with the solar inverter remaining 5 kW or under.
A grace period has been provided for applications made prior to 14 February 2022 but installed by 14 March 2022.

The new requirements will only apply to new and upgraded rooftop solar, meaning existing customers will not be affected.
The WA state government said it is also working on a long-term plan to reduce the need for curtailment, including investment in battery energy storage, improving pricing signals, and allowing for customer devices to provide energy services for payment.
WA is the second state to give network operators the capacity to remotely switch off residential solar systems as an emergency grid stability mechanism. A similar mechanism was first introduced in South Australia (SA) in 2020.
SA network operators utilized the mechanism for the first time in March 2021, remotely switching off more than 10,000 rooftop solar systems and almost 30 MW of large-scale solar PV when the state experienced “near-record minimum demand levels for electricity from the grid.”
Johnston said he expects other states will soon introduce regulations that provide transmission authorities with the ability to restrict solar PV output.
“Anywhere like Queensland that has high levels of rooftop solar will almost certainly follow down this pathway,” he said.
“It’s a sensible solution to a new problem. It allows more solar panels to be installed, and it allows that to benefit the whole community.”

The Southern California Gas Company announced a plan to develop the nation’s largest green hydrogen energy infrastructure system – the “Angeles Link” – which would deliver green hydrogen to the Los Angeles Basin region. Southern California Gas will submit the first phase of its plans to the California Public Utilities Commission today.
While the technical details describing the proposed facility are scant, the company teased us with a few of their broader, auspicious goals:
The green hydrogen is to be produced by electrolyzers, which are powered by renewable energy. Each of the company’s social media pages posted about green hydrogen yesterday. The company also tweeted an article containing the following schematic, which describes what the system might look like:

At the moment, the largest hydrogen electrolyzer in the world is Baofeng Energy’s 150 MW facility in China. But larger facilities are already under construction, and there has been a bevy of newly announced hydrogen electrolyzers recently, especially from Australia.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts that electrolyzer installations in 2022 will quadruple those of last year.
The gas company, along with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Mitsubishi Power, and others, is part of an organization that seeks to deliver green hydrogen to the Los Angeles basin at $1.50/kilogram by 2030.

Southern California Gas launched the first power to gas hydrogen demonstration project in the US in 2015. The company currently has 10 hydrogen pilot projects ‘in motion’.
Perhaps by coincidence, (or not), the U.S. Department of Energy announced two Requests for Information yesterday, for the planning, design, and implementation of the “Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s Regional Hydrogen Hub” and the “Electrolysis and Clean Hydrogen Manufacturing and Recycling Programs.” The goals of these programs include ramping up technology in the sector to assist the industry in reaching a cost of $1/kilogram for hydrogen by 2032.

The company seeks to make use of 25-35GW of curtailed and new wind and solar power, plus two gigawatts of energy storage. The electrolyzer facility will range from 10 to 20GW of capacity and will require 200 to 750 miles of hydrogen infrastructure.
