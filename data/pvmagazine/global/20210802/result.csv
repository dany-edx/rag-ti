Germany saw the addition of 428.5 MW of new PV capacity in June, according to the latest figures from the Federal Network Agency – the Bundesnetzagentur.
This compares to 403 MW in May this year and 437 MW in June 2020. The newly installed solar power generation capacity for the first six months of this year was 2.75 GW. In the same period a year earlier, 2.36 GW of solar capacity was added. 612 MW added in April this year remains the biggest month for PV in Germany, a figure revised slightly down from the original data release.
Of the monthly new additions, 306.7 MW was represented by PV installations with a capacity lower than 300 kW, built under the country's feed-in tariff scheme. This segment reached a total capacity of almost 2 GW for the first half of the year.
The cumulative capacity of all subsidized PV systems in Germany reached 55.3 GW at the end of June.
The Bundesnetzagentur also published new compensation rates which will begin in August. The monthly decrease of solar subsidies remains at 1.4% while fixed feed-in tariffs for rooftop systems will range between €0.0736/kWh and €0.0560/kWh, depending on size.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/02/integration-methodologies-for-solar-assisted-heat-pumps/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 2, 2021",Integration methodologies for solar-assisted heat pumps,"A group of scientists from Italy’s Politecnico di Milano has analyzed the existing integration methodologies to combine a photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) unit with a vapor compression heat pump (HP) in a hybrid system for hot water and heating applications in buildings.
This combination, according to the researchers, has dual advantages. PV can power the HP's compressor and, at the same time, transfer heat from the solar collector to the HP, which can then operate at a higher temperature, improving overall system efficiency. Furthermore, this configuration may also provide active cooling for the PV panels, which would also increase the performance of the PV system and, in a virtuous feedback loop, the HP itself.
Two different main system configurations were considered by the Italian group: a single-source direct-expansion (DX) system, where the PVT system is operated as the HP evaporator; and a dual-source indirect-expansion (IDX) one, where a heat exchanger (HX) is interposed between the PVT unit and the HP, also known as a solar-assisted heat pump (SAHP).
 
In the first configuration, the system does not provide cooling and produces hot water for space heating or domestic hot water (DHW). Crucial for its optimized operation is a real-time compressor frequency control, which adjusts the compressor operating frequency according to real-time radiation.
“Single-source DX-PVT-SAHP is generally adopted for hot water production, but few examples of PVT collectors operated as a condenser during night-time are present in literature,” the scientists explained, noting that this solution is characterized by easier construction and lower complexity and cost, thanks to the absence of any intermediate heat exchanger between the HP and the PVT unit. “However, this characteristic makes direct-expansion configurations more vulnerable to the solar radiation variability, due to the influence on overall performances caused by the mismatch with compressor speed.”
Despite this higher dependence on solar radiation, this solution is claimed to provide the highest heat recovery.
In the second configuration, which is intended at covering the building's entire thermal needs, a second heat source is provided by a second evaporator operated in parallel with the PVT system.
“The presence of an additional heat source, generally air, improves system performances under adverse operating conditions, when the solar energy recovery is not enough to operate the machine,” the academics emphasized. “The IDX-SAHP configuration allows a more flexible arrangement of system sub-components, thus the employment of thermal storage for solar energy or load management.”
The main advantage of this system is represented by a more stable heat gain from the solar side and a lower dependence on weather conditions.
“Dual-source IDX-PVT-SAHP systems are the most feasible solution in climatic contexts where cooling needs are relevant, being able to cover all the building thermal needs,” the research team further explained. “Those systems are also more suitable to be coupled with ground-source HP, which are very popular in heating-dominated regions, where air-source HP systems are less diffused.”
The researchers specified it is very difficult, for either configuration, to define reference sizing approaches, as variables like climatic conditions and building loads have a big impact on the ratio among the HP rated power, the PVT system size and the storages’ size.
Looking forward, the scientists said they want to work on increasing the technology readiness level (TRL) of both configurations. The TRL measures the maturity of technology components for a system and is based on a scale from one to nine, with nine representing mature technologies for full commercial application.
“More experimental works are also needed to demonstrate the actual performances of the whole system in real case-study buildings, also comparing different sizing criteria according to climatic conditions and building loads,” they concluded. “At the same time, ad additional effort is desirable in the development of specific tools able to properly model each component of the system and the system itself as a whole.”
The proposed approach is described in the paper Photovoltaic-thermal solar-assisted heat pump systems for building applications: integration and design methods, published in Energy and Built Environment.

On Friday, two days after Neoen posted the Tweet below, a Tesla Megapack caught fire at the site of the Victorian Big Battery during testing of the Neoen-developed 300 MW/450 MWh project, which is due for completion this year.
Thrilled to announce Victorian Big Battery is now registered with the Australian Energy Market Operator – just over 200 days since the start of construction ! Thanks to everyone involved ! @AEMO_Media @VicGovAU @LilyDAmbrosioMP @Tesla @AusNetServices @downergroup @UGLPtyLimited pic.twitter.com/OD67kUbjF2

Fire and Rescue Victoria led the response to the blaze, which is believed to have originated in one Megapack module and to have affected another on the site.
More than 30 fire trucks and support vehicles responded to the incident, which was contained by firefighters wearing breathing apparatus, before it could spread to others of the 210 battery-energy storage modules on site in Moorabool in the City of Greater Geelong.
A scientific officer monitored air quality with the assistance of drones, and although a Watch & Act Warning was issued after midday, for toxic smoke at Batesford, Bell Post Hill, Lovely Banks and Moorabool residents, Victoria’s Environment Protection Authority found that air quality in the local area remained good.
Neoen Australia’s Managing Director, Louis de Sambucy said in a statement on Friday afternoon that, “No one was injured and the site has been evacuated. Neoen and Tesla are working closely with emergency services on site to manage the situation”.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) confirmed that the battery had been separated from the grid and the fire had not affected operation of electricity services.
The Country Fire Association (CFA) remained on site with FRV after the incident and continued to “monitor the temperature decline of the two affected battery packs”.
An update from the CFA yesterday afternoon (Sunday 1 August), reported, “The fire has subsided significantly. Crews are now doing atmospheric monitoring around the cabinet and will check to see how active the fire is internally behind each of the doors.”
The incident will rekindle concerns that lithium-ion batteries are prone to catching fire, but the cause of the fire is as yet unknown and all parties to the development of the battery facility will be engaged in determining its origins and subsequent appropriate action.
The Victorian Big Battery is set to become one of the largest such storage facilities in the world, and the biggest to be completed so far in Australia.
It will provide a critical boost to the security of Victoria’s energy supply while supporting greater penetration of renewables into the grid.
In November, AEMO awarded the battery a 10-year contract under the System Integrity Protection Scheme, which will require the operators to reserve 250 MW of its capacity to participate in increasing the capability of the Victoria-to-New South Wales Interconnector (VNI) and respond to unexpected network outages.
And in February this year, developer Neoen reached financial close on the battery after the Australian Government’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) provided a $160 million debt facility to finance design, construction and operation of the project.
Tesla’s Megapack technology is also being deployed in Transgrid’s $61.9 million 50 MW/75MWh, Wallgrove Grid Battery in Western Sydney, and in a number of smaller projects.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency has contributed $11.5 million in funding for Wallgrove which should reach completion this year, and which is intended to provide technical experience of how often the battery is needed to contribute fast frequency response to the NSW network, and how much electricity it is able to store and dispatch under various conditions.
Batteries have emerged as a more cost-effective alternative to controlling frequency than other technologies such as synchronous condensers, and are expected to thereby reduce the ultimate cost of electricity to consumers.
Australia’s power systems currently rely on inertia provided by the large turbines at the heart of coal, gas and hydro generators to maintain a consistent frequency and help the system ride out any disturbances. As more sources of wind and solar generation are connected to the grid and coal-fired generators are retired, alternative sources of inertia will be needed to stabilize the network.
ARENA CEO Darren Miller, has said that “Large-scale batteries have a big role to play in firming and balancing our electricity system as we move towards a future energy mix.”
Tesla announced the arrival of its Megapack product in July 2019, as a rapid-deployment, large-scale energy-storage solution.
Supplied fully assembled, Megapack’s modular construction enables the company to install “an emissions free, 250 MW/1 GWh power plant in less than three months” or four times faster than a fossil fuel plant of the same size, the company said at the time.
The Megapack offers a 60% increase in energy density over its Powerpack utility-scale storage systems which were famously installed at the then 100 MW/129 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia in December 2017.
Following its hugely successful deployment, the Hornsdale Power Reserve was expanded to 150 MW/194 MWh in September 2020.
De Sambucy has said, “We will provide updates and further details,” of the fire and its cause, “as they become available.”

Jakson Group has launched the Helia series of high-output PV modules using half-cut mono PERC solar cells. The modules are India’s first to reach 21% efficiency, and allow outputs ranging from 450W to 600W.
The Helia series PV modules will be available in both mono-facial and bifacial categories. The bifacial category offers an additional power gain of up to 15% from the rear side of the modules due to the use of a transparent backsheet.
The modules are equipped with multi-busbar technology and high-density interconnections, offering significantly better output at higher temperatures and under low-light/shading conditions.
The PV modules are designed with excellent anti-potential induced degradation (PID) characteristics and can perform at their peak even in the most challenging of environments. These are covered by 25 years of performance warranty and 12 years of product workmanship warranty.
“The Helia range of PV modules are also cost-effective and will positively impact return on investment (ROI) of a solar plant by reducing the requirement of land/rooftop space. This subsequently translates into a significant reduction in levelized cost of energy (LCOE), balance-of-system (BoS) costs, civil work costs and operation and maintenance costs,” according to Jakson.

A press release issued on Friday by Hong Kong-based solar developer NEFIN and Singaporean energy company Tuas Power stated the latter business, in general terms, draws on a mix of renewables and “fuel-based sources” to feed the Singaporean grid. The press statement also referred to plans “to jointly bid for the 100 megawatts (100 MW[h]) of zero-carbon electricity,” available under a tender being staged by regulator the Energy Market Authority of Singapore.
A spokesperson for NEFIN said the tender is being held to procure the supply of 100 MWh of clean electricity from Malaysia to Singapore for a two-year trial period, with the successful project, or projects expected to be announced this year and start operations next year.
Distributed solar company NEFIN has joined forces with the Tuas Power electric company held by Chinese state-owned parent China Huaneng Group to bid for supply of the whole 100 MWh.
The NEFIN company spokesperson told pv magazine the power supplied “should be green electricity but is not specifically limited to solar,” before adding: “The intermittency of solar will be addressed in the initial phase by brown power plants, and in the future phase by battery storage.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/02/a-closer-look-at-liquid-air-energy-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 2, 2021",A closer look at liquid air energy storage,"A group of scientists from the University of Birmingham, in the United Kingdom, and the University of Melbourne, in Australia, has investigated, in an extensive research, the potential of liquid air energy storage (LAES), which has so far seen development for large scale energy storage, and it has been mostly developed by U.K.-based specialist Highview Power.
The company is currently preparing to deploy LAES technology in a range of locations including a 400 MWh system in the United States, a 250 MWh project in the United Kingdom, and a 300 MWh facility in Spain. “LAES has, currently, a technology readiness level (TRL) of 8,” research co-author Adriano Sciacovelli told pv magazine. The TRL measures the maturity of technology components for a system and is based on a scale from one to nine, with nine representing mature technologies for full commercial application.
The technology is described by the research group as a concept where electricity is stored in the form of liquid air or nitrogen at cryogenic temperatures – below -150 degrees Celsius. It charges by using excess electricity to power compression and liquefaction of the air which is then stored as a liquid at temperatures approaching -196 degrees Celsius. To discharge, the liquid air warms and becomes a pressurized gas that operates a turbine to generate electricity.
It was conceived for utility scale applications and an output ranging from 5 MW to 100 MW. “Compared to pumped-hydro storage, which is based on the same basic concept, cryogenic energy storage has the advantage that it is a technology that can be produced through an established industry and without any expensive or rare material,” emphasized Sciacovelli. “Furthermore, there are no degradation issues and no need for specific locations or the orographic conditions that are needed for pumped-hydro, or of an underground cavity, as for compressed air storage.” Compared to these storage technologies, however, LAES has the drawback of a lower cycle efficiency, for both charging and discharging, which is close to 60%. Nonetheless, cycle efficiency can be increased through integration and co-location of LAES with nearby processes, for example liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals.
An LAES system produces hot and cold streams during its operation, both during air compression for charging and evaporation for discharging, and these streams can be utilized to improve the system efficiency, or in several industrial process. “Currently, all existing projects are being developed for grid support but decarbonization targets will likely push this technology closer to industrial processes that waste a lot of heat,” Sciacovelli stated.
The ideal location of cryogenic storage is at a grid node with a high share of renewables or an industrial park with large waste of heat. “Cryogenic storage is not directly competing with lithium-ion batteries as it provides storage for a longer duration, from over 10 hours,” Sciacovelli added. “By contrast, for lithium-ion storage, when it is needed for more than between four and six hours, bankability, currently, remains an issue.”
In terms of costs, the research group estimated that a LAES system can be built at between €300 and €600 per kilowatt-hour. “Investment return is estimated at approximately 20 years for a standalone system without integration with an industrial facility for use of excess heat,” research co-author Andrea Vecchi told pv magazine. “An ideal location in an industrial park, however, may significantly reduce this time frame.”
All existing projects were defined by the research team as bankable, although they stressed that these positive business cases are favored by certain conditions, including a determined price structure in the energy market and the presence of a grid unable to support high levels of renewable energy penetration. “LAES systems are, so far, conceived as strategic assets for the power network,” Vecchi further explained. “They can provide not only grid balancing but several grid services.”
Furthermore, the scientist went on to say, due to the high energy density of liquid air, cryogenic storage occupies less space than compressed air or pumped hydro. “We estimate that these systems can be smaller by at least an order of magnitude,” he stated.
More details on the research can be found in the paper Liquid air energy storage (LAES): a review on technology state-of-the-art, integration pathways and future perspectives, published in Advances in Applied Energy.
*The article was amended on August 2 to reflect that the estimated cost for a LAES system is expressed in kilowatt-hours.

The project will be owned and developed by the special purpose vehicle Pro Energy LLC, which is jointly owned by ProCredit Bank Kosovo and its Frankfurt-based parent company, ProCredit Holding AG & Co KGaA.
Interested developers will have time until August 31 to submit their project proposals.
If built, the solar plant will become the country's first solar park. Currently, Kosovo's grid operator, KOSTT, is also planning a 150 MW PV facility in the municipality of Gjakova, in the southwestern part of the country.
Kosovo had just 10 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2020, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The country recently raised its renewable energy target to an additional 400 MW of capacity by 2026. That would be enough to meet a quarter of its power demand and would reduce dependence on aging coal-fired power plants.
Most of Kosovo’s electricity is supplied as imports or from two lignite-fired thermal power plants, the 40-year-old Kosovo A Power Station (with a 345 MW generation capacity) near Pristina, and the upgraded, 27-year-old, Kosovo B Power Station (540 MW) in Obilić.

A traditional gas-powered light-duty car costs about $1,260 a year to fuel, an EV lands at about $1,058 per year when a public charger is used. With home solar, EV owners can power their car for as little as $415 annually, according to a new consumer report run by SolarReviews.
Over a 25-year span, a typical warranty period for home solar, SolarReviews estimated that charging an EV with home solar could lead to average savings of $16,250.
The DOE also reports that scheduled maintenance for light-duty vehicles costs at about ten cents per mile, while battery electric vehicles only cost about six cents per mile to maintain.

A battery electric vehicle lacks engine oil, timing belts, oxygen sensors, spark plugs, and many more components and the maintenance costs associated with them. This means, over their lifetime, EV’s cost 40% less in scheduled maintenance costs than traditional gas-powered vehicles.
SolarReviews compared a gas-powered Hyundai Kona, and an all-electric Hyundai Kona, and found that in a 13,500-mile year, the gas-powered Kona would spend $1,260 on gas, while the EV charged at home would spend $662 per year in California, and as little as $450 per year in a state like Florida.
Plus, home solar energy is cheaper and greener than pulling your EV’s power from the grid. Grid-sourced energy can range from $.10 to $.40 per kWh, and averages about $.13 per kWh, while the levelized cost of energy for home solar across the country landed at $.11 per kWh, according to SolarReviews. Both of these options are significantly cheaper than a public charger, which ranges from $.28 to $.69 per kWh.
From a carbon standpoint, home solar performs the best as well, reported SolarReviews. Home solar has an implied emission of 368 lbs. of carbon dioxide per 3,780 kWh, while grid power and EV chargers stand at 1,531 lbs., and 450 gallons of gasoline (an equivalent to 3,780 kWh) would emit a whopping 8,830 lbs. of CO2.

Curiosity for EVs and their integration with home solar is on the rise, as SolarReviews reported a 1000% year over year increase in requests to estimate the solar requirements of charging a Tesla on their website. They suggest that an average of five additional solar panels would be sufficient for the average driver to meet the needs of a Tesla Model 3 charged on a level 2 charger.
“Home solar is the key to unlocking the most value from an EV investment, representing the cheapest charging method with the lowest carbon footprint when compared to public EV chargers, grid power and gasoline,” said Andy Sendy, Founder and President of SolarReviews. “Home solar is the clear solution for consumers looking to get the most out of their electric vehicles and realize consistent and sustainable cost savings.”

Calgary-based TC Energy Corp. said it reached an agreement with the Canadian Department of National Defense that allows for the development of a 1,000 MW pumped hydro energy storage project on federal lands in Ontario.
The Ontario Pumped Storage Project, proposed to be built on the Department of National Defense’s 4th Canadian Division Training Centre property by TC Energy, would be the province’s largest energy storage project.
TC Energy operates across North America, including 57,900 miles of natural gas pipeline, more than 653 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage, and 4,200 MW of electric power generation.
The pumped hydro project aims in part to reduce the amount of electricity that is exported from the province at a loss. The developer said that exports to Quebec and Manitoba, as well as to New York, Michigan, and Minnesota, result in a loss of C$384 million ($309 million).
“Ontario consumers are effectively paying for electrical capacity that contributes to the clean-up of other jurisdictions’ energy systems,” according to the company website. It said that in 2016, Ontario exported 14.6 TWh of electricity at a loss.
The pumped storage project would help to optimize the province’s electricity system and deliver more than C$250 million ($200 million) in annual savings to electricity consumers.
TC Energy said is will now move on to the next phase of project development. That includes provincial and federal environmental and impact assessments. It said further development remains subject to conditions, including approval by the company’s Board of Directors, regulatory approvals, and assurances that the project will not impact military activities and training.
