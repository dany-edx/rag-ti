Ashraf Kraidy, director for planning and technical projects at the Regional Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RCREEE) told a recent online event: “If we look at the energy market worldwide, we can see how oil and gas prices are fluctuating and going up. This gives investment opportunities for renewable energy. Renewable investments have stable prices in terms of electricity production.”
Kraidy, representing the not-for-profit organization set up in 2008 to promote clean energy and energy efficiency across the Arab world, pointed to recent climate change goals set by the governments of Egypt and Morocco, with the former aiming for 42% of its power to come from renewables by 2035 and the latter 52% by 2040.
The latest edition of pv magazine investigates the rapid rise of TOPCon cell manufacturing. While not the only option PV manufacturers have their eye on, TOPCon is already the first n-type cell to claim significant market share. We chart the tech’s progress from laboratory to gigawatt production, plus efforts to standardize process flows, reduce costs, and raise performance.
With the event focusing on solar industry prospects in Egypt, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and Morocco, Kraidy said most of the region's governments are moving towards auction bidding to determine the level of subsidy paid for clean power generation.
The RCREEE representative said utility scale solar plants dominate the regional PV market and he emphasized the need for smaller, rooftop arrays in North Africa.
Egypt dominates the region's solar industry, with 1.6GW of generation capacity, double the level installed in Morocco, with Algeria boasting around 500MW of solar, Tunisia 200MW and Libya just 20MW.
Those figures could rise, said Kraidy, in response to burgeoning demand and plenty of interest from investors, including donor entities.
“We can see investment opportunities in the region with a lot of donors willing to support the development of renewable energies,” said Kraidy. “Various financing facilities have been announced, with competitive prices. The governments in the region have set policies that enable investment to grow. We have witnessed large investment and multinational companies are landing in North Africa to work in the field of renewable energy, with solar energy being on top.”
Obstacles remain, however, as Fahmi Chine – North Africa sales manager for Chinese solar manufacturer JA Solar pointed out. With political instability and conflict between traditional, state-owned utilities and independent generators deterring some investors, Chine pointed out regulatory bodies could help address some of the problems present in the region.
The online event was held in partnership with Chinese inverter maker Solis.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/14/kaust-researchers-achieve-20-1-efficiency-in-heterojunction-solar-cell-based-on-2d-mxenes-electrodes/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SAUDI ARABIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 14, 2022",KAUST researchers achieve 20.1% efficiency in heterojunction solar cell based on 2D MXenes electrodes,"Scientists led by Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have developed a heterojunction solar cell by replacing traditional silver metal contacts with rear electrodes based on two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides known as MXenes.
Earth-abundant MXenes compounds take their name from their graphene-like morphology and are made via selective etching of certain atomic layers from a bulk crystal known as MAX.
The researchers employed an MXenes compound known as titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx), which has already been used in previous research for application in solar cells, to fabricate the films with a thickness of less than 2μm that were used as electrodes for the solar cell. “Taking advantage of their solution processability and hydrophilicity, we opted for spray coating to directly deposit the Ti3C2Tx flakes on the [rear] side of solar cells,” they further explained. “The automated spray-coating system allows for fine thickness control and homogeneity over large areas, bringing industrial relevance to the process.”
The ultrasonic automated spraying system used by the Saudi group operates at moderate substrate temperatures of between 150 and 180
degrees Celsius, which is described as a critical threshold to avoid the degradation of solar cells. “Generally, spraying at higher temperatures may promote the effusion of hydrogen from the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) passivation stacks, resulting in low open-circuit voltage values,” it highlighted.
An MXene-contacted heterojunction cell with an area of 4.2cm2 was able to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 20.1%, which compares to 21.6% in a similar device built with silver contacts. “Notably, the Ti3C2Tx-rear-contacted devices have retained around 99% of their initial efficiency for more than 600 days of ambient air storage,” the academics stated. “Their performance is comparable with state-of-the-art solar cells contacted with sputtered silver electrodes.”
They also fabricated a bigger solar cell, with an area of 243cm2, and found it showed low series resistance.
Their approach was introduced in the paper “Scaled Deposition of Ti3C2Tx MXene on Complex Surfaces: Application Assessment as Rear Electrodes for Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells,” published in ACS Nano. “Our findings demonstrate the high-throughput potential of spray-coated MXene-based electrodes for solar cells, in addition to a wider variety of electronic device applications,” they concluded.
Scientists from Dongguk University, Korea University, and Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU) have recently investigated how two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides known as MXenes could be used as materials for solar cells. According to them, these materials exhibit good conductive behavior but a few of them with suitable surface terminations can also exhibit semiconductor-like behavior. In their work, they identified Ti3C2Tx as the most promising material.

In the document “Decarbonising End-use Sectors: Green Hydrogen Certification,” the group of experts stressed the importance of relying on independent third parties for the verification of all data on the green hydrogen tracking systems, as well as on objective and public disclosure standards.
Two main models were identified for the future certification scheme: a “book and claim” system that is mostly applied to renewable electricity, in which the claim on consuming renewable energy booked by an energy provider is separate from the physical flow; and a “mass balancing” system that is commonly utilized for biofuels, in which a physical link between the production and consumption of green energy must always be proved.
“By granting consumers fully reliable information on the hydrogen supplied to them, such a tracking system can incentivize companies to commit to using green hydrogen, create social interest, and promote consumer information, and therefore have the potential to accelerate the clean energy transition,” the report reads. “The standardization of these certificates can also allow and support the development of green hydrogen trading and accelerate the emergence and establishment of an international market.”
The document also highlighted the difficulty of implementing common regulations on a global scale and the possibility that several communication issues may arise between the systems of different countries. “Transparency issues may come up if information on the production process and transport, particularly relating to links with non-renewables, is not clearly traced, documented, and stated,” the IRENA experts noted.
Four main requirements were outlined for the certification of hydrogen produced by renewable energy sources: A temporal correlation ensuring that the electricity used for the electrolysis is renewable; a geographical correlation, requiring some degree of physical link, for the hydrogen production; avoiding higher shares of fossil-generated electricity elsewhere in the electricity system; and specifications providing full transparency and information on the resources used.
Furthermore, carbon emissions should be considered for each kilogram of green hydrogen along the entire value chain, from production to transport. “Nevertheless, a degree of flexibility in regard to the geographical, temporal and additionality requirements should be taken into account in the short term to ensure that the nascent green hydrogen market can develop,” the document notes.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/14/uk-considers-reform-of-renewables-subsidy-regimes/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,EVENTS,FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED KINGDOM",ILIAS TSAGAS,"MARCH 14, 2022",UK considers reform of renewables subsidy regimes,"A conference has been held in the UK to consider whether the nation's two electricity subsidy mechanisms – the capacity market and the contracts for difference (CFD) regime – need to be reformed, and how.
With the government reportedly planning a wave of wind farms and nuclear facilities to shore up UK energy independence in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine – and with lobbying from some quarters to relax a national ban on fracking, and attempts to persuade Middle Eastern OPEC nations to ramp up oil output – attendees at the London event agreed huge volumes of low-carbon electricity will be needed for the country to achieve a net zero economy by 2050.
As part of that national goal, the UK government wants carbon neutral electricity by 2035 although left-of-center national newspaper The Guardian yesterday reported prime minister Boris Johnson is preparing to bring that date forward.
David Newberry, Cambridge University, speaking at the electricity subsidy event organized by the Westminster Energy, Environment and Transport Forum at the end of February, said the UK would need to double its current renewable energy generation capacity this decade.
Reducing the cost of finance would help attract investors to renewables projects, he said, and he suggested the CFD rules – which allocate permits for clean power plants using an auction bidding mechanism to determine the level of subsidy for the power generated – should be tweaked to reflect the locations of solar, wind, and other clean power plants.
That is because, Newberry argued, renewable energy project revenues vary more due to site location than to the times when generation takes place.
Other energy industry stakeholders questioned the form of the CFD rules, albeit on issues which reflected their interests. Under the CFD regime, renewable energy generators bid a maximum tariff “strike price” to be received from the government. Generators receive the strike price minus the day-ahead hourly wholesale price of electricity as a bonus on top of any payments they receive separately from the commercial sale of the power they generate. When the day-ahead wholesale rate is higher than the strike price set at auction, generators sell the power and refund the difference to the government, reducing the burden on public finances.
Barnaby Wharton, head of policy at clean energy umbrella organization RenewableUK, said the CFD rules are “a hugely successful policy, driving cost reduction in offshore wind and delivering benefits to electricity consumers.”
The government in December launched a fourth CFD auction, three years after the last clean energy procurement round, and has pledged to stage the events annually from next March.
Whitehall is pushing for more offshore wind farms as they are seen as more socially acceptable than onshore clean power sites but Wharton said the aim of CFD auctions should be the national net zero target rather than delivering specific renewables technology.
The RenewableUK representative suggested it is time to seek a market-based system to drive renewables deployment, rather than relying on government contracting, because the CFD regime “won’t be with us forever.” Wharton said it is time to consider a net zero marginal price system to support renewables.
The prospect of such radical change to the subsidy regime prompted reactions from representatives of two utilities at the event.
Kate Turner is policy and regulation director at Scottish Power, which recently switched to a renewables-only portfolio for the electricity the company generates. She said the utility would like “to see clear parameters set for the newly announced, annual CFD auctions.”
David Bird, investment director at Octopus Energy, argued CFDs provide price certainty and have a place, at least for now, although he did ask “what the CFDs should do and for how long?”
Bird hinted CFDs provide price stability to technologies that are already cost competitive and for that reason he called for a new system that “combines the wholesale market, the balancing and other markets to work together for a fully decarbonized power sector by 2035.” An innovative system of that nature would include a greater role for managing energy demand and grid flexibility, Bird added, mentioning two functions Octopus has a strong focus on.
Another regime which came under the spotlight at the Westminster event was the UK capacity market, which pays generators to have sufficient extra power generation capacity on hand which can be ramped up rapidly to meet grid stress events.
Kathryn Bird, head of the capacity market policy, electricity security and market evolution team at the UK government's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), told the event her team works to address challenges related to the capacity market. That work, Bird said, is based on a call for feedback on the capacity market mechanism, held by BEIS from July to November.
That call for evidence aimed to address the mechanism’s future design and a summary of the responses received will be published this spring, with further stakeholder engagement to be sought immediately afterwards, the aim being to consult on any reform options which could be proposed.
Questions under consideration by BEIS as part of the exercise include how to align the capacity market with net zero targets; whether the auction design needs to change, perhaps by having different categories of auctions with multiple clearing prices; how to manage the transition from unabated to abated fossil fuel plants; and whether there is a need for a new support mechanism or a redesign of the existing systems to address technologies such as hydrogen or other projects with long build times.
While attendees at the Westminster event said they were broadly supportive of reform to the capacity market, many emphasized the risk of ending up with an overly complicated system that could hinder progress.
The elephant in the room, as always when renewables are under discussion, was the need for flexibility in the electricity grid, with Keith Bell, of Scotland's University of Strathclyde, stressing the need for flexible measures such as energy storage, demand-side response, and electric grid interconnectors, to fill the gaps at periods when no solar or wind power is being generated.
Bell said the option of using electric vehicle (EV) batteries for grid storage was interesting but stressed the power rate is crucial for the operation of batteries. On the subject of such vehicle-to-grid deployment, Bell asked what would EV energy storage capacity be used for? When would it be available? And at what times would EV batteries be plugged in?
The University of Strathclyde academic added, the different stages of market maturity for competing energy storage technologies would be reflected in a range of costs that would have to be taken into account in a revised capacity market system.
Batteries and demand-side response projects are eligible for inclusion under the current capacity market rules but the devil is in the detail and the de-rating factor applied to shorter-duration batteries – which means less revenue because they supply a shorter solution to keeping the lights on – often rules out energy storage sites from viable operation under the grid-back-up subsidy regime. Even those battery facilities which secure capacity market payments often need other sources of income.
The switch from electricity settlement prices based on historical customer consumption patterns to real-time prices set every half hour is expected to do much to boost the demand for network flexibility services, but that change is not due to take place market wide in the UK until October 2025.
The lack of any solar industry representatives at the Westminster event reflected how little the sector has turned to either CFDs or the capacity market for support in the UK.
Solar returned to the fold in the current CFD auction round, after being banned from the exercises since 2015, but only to the extent it will compete with onshore wind facilities for a £10 million (€11.9 million) slice of the total £285 million (€340 million) pot.
The very low derating score applied to solar projects in the capacity market – because of the tech's rigidly time-sensitive hours of generation – has ensured it is not a viable route for remuneration. The answer to that conundrum could lie in the development of solar farms which include grid flexibility technology.
This copy was amended on 15/03/22 to reflect David Newberry did not call for CFD rules to incentivize renewables facilities near centers of energy demand, he instead pointed out the business case for such plants differed according to location and the CFD regime should reflect that. The previous statement that Octopus Energy benefits from CFD payments was incorrect and has been removed.

“Our system has already been used in combination with power generation from biomass but we could ould think of a well and efficient working system in combination with solar photovoltaics,” the company's simulation engineer, Andreas Längauer, told pv magazine. “We have already done some analyses and got requests about that which look really interesting and promising.”
The system reportedly has a coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.0 – 7.0 that is around 70% higher than that compared to conventional heat pumps, which ecop estimates at 2.5 – 5.0. “We have already improved the COP a lot and the system works very well. But, of course, we are still developing and trying to make our rotation heat pump work even better,” Längauer went on to say, noting that this COP level can be achieved already at a temperature of 150 degrees Celsius.
The machine measures 2.2 x8.1×2.7m and weighs in at 18t. It works through an anticlockwise running Joule process, during which there is no phase transition of the working medium that always remains gaseous.  It uses an inert gas which the company says has zero global warming potential, is widely available, inexpensive, and does not pose any security issues.
The gas circulates in a closed cycle, which rotates around an axis. The heat exchangers are positioned closer and farther away from the axis of rotation and connected to lines, in order to establish a thermodynamic cyclic process. During rotation, the centrifugal force increases with increasing distance from the axis of rotation, and the working gas is compressed by the centrifugal force.
To operate the cycle, the working gas circulates in the closed cycle by means of a fan. The strong pressure in the off-axis areas raises the gas temperature and the generated heat is then conveyed into a sink via a heat exchanger. “When the gas that is cooled that way expands again, its temperature changes to a lower level due to the flow against the centrifugal force and can thereby take up heat again at the source via the heat exchanger close to the axis,” the company explained.
In its current form, the heat pump has a capacity of 700kW and a technology readiness level (TRL) of seven. The TRL measures the maturity of technology components for a system and is based on a scale from one to nine, with nine representing mature technologies for full commercial application.
The machine could be used in combination with district heating and industrial processes such as distillation, pasteurization, washing, and cooking. “The rotation heat pump may be sold at around €490,000, where also good options for funding are given,” Längauer said. “Since our technology is quite new and innovative, this is a very good and attractive way to build up financing.”
The project has received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.

India added 3.17GW of solar power in the fourth quarter of 2021, and about 80% (2.5GW) of the total was utility-scale capacity. Around 16% (520MW) was rooftop solar, while just 4% (120MW) was offgrid PV capacity, according to Bridge To India’s latest quarterly report.
The nation's cumulative installed PV capacity stood at 50.5GW by Dec. 31, 2021. This included 40.4GW of utility-scale, 8.57GW of rooftop solar, and 1.47GW of offgrid capacity. Total project capacity in pipeline (projects allocated to developers and at various stages of development) stood at 63.3GW.
Bridge To India analysts expect the first quarter of 2022 to see PV capacity additions surge to 3.7GW as developers rush their installations before PV module costs go up due to the imposition of a basic customs duty from April 1.
“Total EPC cost for utility-scale solar increased from INR 31.19/Wp to INR 33.14/Wp in Q4 2021 on account of increase in goods and services tax (GST) from 5% to 12%. Cost is expected to further shoot up in Q2 2022 due to imposition of 40% basic customs duty on modules,” according to the report.
“Prices for mono-PERC modules, currently at $0.27/Wp, are likely to remain relatively firm over (the) next two quarters and fall gradually by end of the year due to strong global demand and persistent supply chain constraints in China,” added Bridge To India.

The authorization process for the six projects has stalled in recent years and the move from the Italian government is in response to a policy change for renewable energy permits.
The Italian cabinet added it took a similar measure on Feb. 18, when the authorizations for two more wind projects totaling 65MW were also streamlined. “From the end of 2021, utility scale renewable energy projects with an aggregate capacity of 1.4 GW were unlocked,” it said in a press release.
At the end of November 2021, Italian high-voltage grid operator, Terna, and Enel Distribuzione, responsible for the low and middle-voltage network, agreed to review grid-connection requests for PV projects with a combined capacity of 90 and 20GW, respectively, which shows the huge interest between investors.
According to the Italian solar association Italia Solare, however, this impressive pipeline is currently difficult to unlock, as Italy's regulatory framework represents a barrier that makes project development and construction very difficult, if not impossible in some cases.
“What is missing and is urgently needed is the identification of regional targets in order to urgently move on to defining suitable areas,” Italia Solare's president, Paolo Rocco Viscontini told pv magazine in December. “But, without regional targets, which are otherwise known as burden sharing, you can't get anywhere. I also see the need to adopt policies aimed at encouraging storage for commercial and industrial PV, as well as for the utility scale segment. In doing so, we may avoid continuing to say that renewables are not programmable.”
Italy deployed 937MW of new PV systems in 2021 and its cumulative installed solar power reached 22.56GW at the end of December. Italy's National Integrated Plan for Climate and Energy aims for 50GW of solar by 2030.

Sun Cable, which plans to supply renewable electricity to Darwin and Singapore from a massive solar PV farm and battery energy storage facility in Australia’s Northern Territory, has reached another milestone with iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest and tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes contributing to a AUD 210 million (&152.2 million) capital raising.
Project developer Sun Cable announced at the weekend it had raised AUD 210 million in a Series B capital raising with Forrest, through his private company Squadron Energy, and Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures among the existing investors to take part.
Sun Cable is seeking to develop a giant solar and battery complex in the Northern Territory. The Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink), being developed on a 12,000-hectare site at Powell Creek in the Barkly region, includes a solar farm with up to 20GW of solar generation and between 36GWh and 42GWh of energy storage.
The intercontinental project will supply power to Darwin and to Singapore via a 4,200-kilometer high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission network, including a 750km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800km HVDC submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore. The project is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power more than 3 million homes a year.
Sun Cable Chief Executive David Griffin said the latest funding will underpin early development work and “will take us all the way through to the financial close of the Australia-Asia PowerLink,” targeted for late 2023.
“It will also allow us to accelerate development of our broader portfolio,” he said. “Our mission is to supply renewable electricity from resource-abundant regions to growing load centres at scale.”
Griffin said the company plans to explore other “multi-gigawatt” solar projects based on the know-how developed since the AAPowerLink was first announced in 2019.
“Sun Cable has developed unique intellectual property to facilitate the optimal design of complex dispatchable renewable electricity generation and transmission projects,” he said.

“We have developed a world-leading capability in four short years. We are thrilled to have materially strengthened our resources with the support of all of our shareholders, who are such strong advocates for our mission.
“This capital raise will enable the delivery of renewable solar power from Australia to Singapore, advance our other multi-gigawatt scale projects, and support the progress of key facilitating assets.”
Griffin did not reveal where the other projects would be located, only that more details are likely to be announced “some months from now.”
Cannon-Brookes, the co-founder of software firm Atlassian, said the capital raise, the first for Sun Cable since late 2019, “brings Australia one step closer to realising our renewable energy potential.”
“We can power the world with clean energy and Sun Cable is harnessing that at scale,” he said. “It’s a blueprint for how we export energy across the world. We fully back this vision.”
Construction of the key elements of the AAPowerLink project is expected to begin in early 2024 with the first power to be supplied to Darwin in 2026. The first supply of electricity to Singapore is expected in 2027 with full capacity expected by the end of 2028.
The project, which is anticipated will be capable of supplying up to 15% of Singapore’s electricity needs, has already secured key approvals with the Australian federal government awarding it Major Project Status while the Indonesian government has approved the submarine transmission cable route and granted approval to undertake the next stage of the subsea cable survey.
Sun Cable has also reached agreement with a powerhouse line-up of international engineering and advisory companies, including United States-based engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) giant Bechtel, North American transmission specialist Hatch, professional services firms Marsh and PwC Australia, and Australia-headquartered engineering outfit SMEC, to help it deliver the project.
Forrest said he expects Sun Cable’s vision to “transform Australia’s capability to become a world-leading generator and exporter of renewable electricity and enable decarbonization … this capital raise is a critical step in developing the Australia-Asia PowerLink and I applaud Sun Cable realising this mission.”
Sun Cable expects the AAPowerLink project will produce as much as AUD 2 billion a year in exports, create more than 1,500 jobs in construction, 350 operational jobs, and 12,000 indirect jobs.

They described the system in “Electrostatic dust removal using adsorbed moisture–assisted charge induction for sustainable operation of solar panels,” which was recently published in Science Advances. They said it is a device that is able to “actively charge” dust particles and impart strong Coulombic force for dust repulsion.
“Our approach overcomes the prior limitations that occur due to reliance on relatively weak, short-range dielectrophoretic/triboelectric force and eliminates the issue of electrical shorting,” the scientists explained.
The waterless system can be operated automatically via an electric motor and is activated by an electrode placed on top of the module surface. The electric charge it releases repels dust particles from the panels. The bottom electrode consists of a glass plate coated with a 5 nm transparent and conductive layer of aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO), using atomic layer deposition (ALD). It is mobile to avoid shading and moves along the panel during cleaning with a linear guide stepper motor mechanism.
The system can be operated at a voltage of around 12V. The researchers said that it can recover 95% of the lost power after cleaning for particle sizes greater than around 30 μm.
“We use Arizona test dust (intermediate and miscellaneous test dust fractions from Powder Technology Inc.), also known as crystalline silica dust, whose chemical composition emulates that of typical desert mineral dust particles in our experiments,” the researchers said.
One of the researchers, Sreedath Panati, said that the group performed experiments at a range of humidity levels, from 5% to 95%. “As long as the ambient humidity is greater than 30%, you can remove almost all of the particles from the surface, but as humidity decreases, it becomes harder,” said Panati.
The simulations showed that the electricity consumption of the device is negligible.
“There is no current flow between the top and bottom electrodes and therefore no electrical power consumption. The only mode of power consumption is that associated with the translation of the moving electrode,” they said, noting that more cost reductions could be achieved by further reducing the thickness of the electrode coating.

No US state has led the energy transition like California has. While other states may have higher portions of wind in their electricity mix, at full sun the output of solar panels in California rivals that of Texas wind power. It has often been the first state in the nation to pass policies that drive the move to renewable energy and electrification, and these policies are regularly imitated elsewhere. As a result California has been a pioneer for a range of clean energy technologies.
California has also been the first to experience the challenges of the transition. The state is famous for its “duck curve,” where solar floods the grid in midday and forces other sources of power to ramp quickly in the evening to meet demand when the sun goes down. The responses to this and other challenges in California have taken many forms – including an emphasis on demand response and using imports and gas plants more flexibly. It has also meant a lot of batteries.
California has long been the nation’s leading market for both battery storage, and solar-plus-storage solutions. But PV Intel’s examination of the interconnection queue from California’s grid operator shows that in terms of large-scale projects, this transformation is reaching another stage. California is on the cusp of no longer being a solar market where batteries are being added – instead, it is becoming a battery market that (sometimes) includes solar.
Rapid battery growth
The numbers are stark: At the end of January, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) queue included a total of 282 projects with a solar component (including various hybrids of solar-plus-storage and solar-plus-wind), compared to 533 projects with a battery component. The raw capacities tell the same story. At 135GW, the capacity of battery projects is 78% higher than the 76GW of solar projects.
These numbers underscore the very rapid growth of battery technology in California. According to the American Clean Power Association, California had only 256MW of utility-scale batteries before 2020, but had reached 2.1GW by the end of 2021 – an eightfold increase.
In fact, few standalone solar projects are being proposed anymore. We found only 23 solar projects in the queue that don’t include batteries, meaning that more than 90% of solar projects that have applied for interconnection have a battery component.
This is in stark contrast to other grid operator queues, where solar-plus-storage projects are still niche. The most advanced may be ISO-New England, where in January 30% of total active solar projects were paired with batteries. In Texas (ERCOT) there is also substantial battery capacity in the interconnection queue, but it is not clear how much is paired with solar.
When pairing generation, solar and batteries are still the main choice in California, as the “chocolate and peanut butter” combination of the energy transition. The 256 solar-plus-storage projects representing 72GW of solar and 64GW of batteries make up the vast majority of hybrid projects in the CAISO queue, with only a handful of wind-plus-storage or solar-plus-wind projects.
Another notable factor is the size of the batteries. Gone are the days when small batteries were added to solar projects. The average ratio of battery capacity to solar capacity was 0.89. Nor are the standalone battery projects small; the average capacity of a standalone battery project in the CAISO queue is 248MW.
In terms of projects with interconnection agreements – a subset of projects which are more likely to be completed and to come online more quickly – solar-plus-storage is still dominant.  Now, 76 solar-plus-storage projects have been approved for interconnection, as opposed to 31 standalone battery projects.
However, most of this capacity is scheduled to come online in 2022 and 2023. This means that with new projects getting approved, as early as 2024 the market could flip to standalone battery projects being dominant.
Battery era
This is not to imply that all the energy storage projects that will be built are batteries. Notably there is a 500MW pumped hydroelectric project in California that has an interconnection agreement and is scheduled to come online in 2028; the long-term plans of California utilities show 1GW of “long-duration storage,” which implies that this will be pumped hydro.
But the capacities of pumped hydro and other novel storage technologies planned are dwarfed by batteries, with lithium-ion continuing to dominate the market. And as a recent solicitation by California’s community choice aggregators shows, lithium-ion batteries are even being chosen for long-duration storage needs.
California will need all the energy storage it can get its hands on; a recent analysis suggests that the state needs 37GW of batteries over the next 20 years, as well as 53.2GW of utility-scale solar. But the projects that are being planned put the state well on its way; as 23.5GW of large-scale battery projects already have interconnection agreements. The next few years will see whether or not California’s battery market can overcome supply chain challenges and stand on its own. But the path forward is clear. In California, the energy transition has entered a new era: the era of the battery.
