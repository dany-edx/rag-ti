The carport may rely on two different inverters provided by Chinese manufacturer Huawei, depending on the system size: a 97.6% device with 4 MTTP trackers and a nominal power of 20 kW; and a 98.9%-efficient inverter with 6 MTTP trackers and power of 50 kW.
The carport length can range from 10.5 m, for a structure able to host four vehicles, to 26.2 m, which would be enough to host ten vehicles. Width and eight are 5.2 and 3.0 m, respectively.
The carport will be sold in Japan starting from December. The company said it expects to generate revenue of ¥2 billion ($17.5 million) with this new solution by 2025. Sinanen is also offering a residential solar carport solution since 2012 and it says it has installed more than 1,000 turnkey system to date.

Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Yamaha Motor are proceeding with joint research for hydrogen engine development for two-wheeled and other vehicles, while Toyota's hydrogen-engine vehicle will compete in the Super Taikyu Race in Okayama. “Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Yamaha Motor have started considerations toward the joint development of a hydrogen engine for possible use in two-wheeled vehicles. Going forward, they are set to be joined by Honda Motor Co., Ltd and Suzuki Motor Corporation, and the four companies intend to jointly explore the possibility of achieving carbon neutrality through the use of internal combustion engines in two-wheeled vehicles,” Toyota wrote on its website. In terms of hydrogen production, Toyota is teaming up with Fukuoka City, which is to supply Toyota with hydrogen derived from sewage biogas. “The city is producing non-CO2-increasing green hydrogen from biogas generated during sewage treatment at the Fukuoka City Chubu Water Treatment Center and has a daily hydrogen production capacity of 3,300 Nm3,” wrote Toyota. It seems clear that Toyota is ready to diversify its strategy, and join Japanese collaborations in the hydrogen sector.

Renault Master City Bus H2-TECH is an urban minibus, which can carry up to 15 passengers with a range of about 300 km. “Both vehicles will be available in 2022 with green hydrogen production and distribution solutions,” Hyvia wrote on Tuesday, adding that they are equipped with a 30 kW fuel cell assembled in France. Hyvia is a joint venture between Renault and U.S. hydrogen solutions company Plug Power
German engineering conglomerate Thyssenkrupp is considering listing its hydrogen business in an initial public offering (IPO) in the first quarter of 2022, Bloomberg reported on Monday. Uhde Clorine Engineers could be valued at €5 billion. The Dortmund-based thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers is a 66-34 joint venture between thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions and Italy’s Industrie De Nora. It is reportedly the largest supplier of chlor-alkali membrane technologies.
Portugal’s renewable energy company EDPR announced last week that it plans to invest in 1.5 GW of renewable hydrogen by 2030, a six-fold increase from its initial target of 250 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity by 2025. The company will coordinate, among others, the Green H2 Atlantic project that will generate green hydrogen in Sines, Setúbal district, in Portugal. It will involve a total investment of €76.6 million, with a contribution of €30 million from European funds. EDPR will also lead a project in Asturias, which aims to create a Hydrogen Valley.
Canadian mineral exploration and development company Mkango has announced that HyProMag has established an 80% owned German subsidiary. HyProMag GmbH is 20% held by Carlo Burkhardt of Pforzheim University in Germany, who has also been appointed to the Board of Directors. The company wants to roll out the commercialization of HPMS (Hydrogen Processing of Magnet Scrap) technology into Germany and Europe. “Germany has no domestic sources of primary rare earths. Development of domestic sources of recycled rare earths via the patented HPMS is a significant opportunity to diversify and strengthen development of a more resilient rare earths supply chain in Europe,” the company wrote on Monday.
The government of Alberta presented its Hydrogen Roadmap earlier this month, focused on exporting hydrogen. “With Alberta’s Recovery Plan, we are laying the groundwork now to establish Alberta as a source of low-emitting hydrogen that can power Canada and the world for decades to come,” said Premier Jason Kenney on November 5. Alberta’s strategy hinges also on carbon capture, utilization, and storage.
Switzerland’s energy company Axpo, petroleum merchant Voegtlin-Meyer, medium-sized energy supply company IBB Energie and the town of Brugg have signed a letter of intent to build a green hydrogen facility close to the power plant in Brugg. “The plant is designed for an installed capacity of up to 15 MW and will produce about 2,000 tonnes of green hydrogen a year by electrolysis. The electricity required for production comes from the nearby Wildegg-Brugg hydropower plant owned by Axpo,” the companies wrote on Monday. They explained that some of the produced hydrogen will be transported via pipeline to the nearby filling station. Voegtlin-Meyer plans to make green hydrogen available to private users, especially in the transportation sector. In December, the municipality of Brugg will decide on the granting of building rights. Axpo wrote that, in the case of a positive vote from Brugg, the commissioning of the plant is planned for the end of 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/16/new-tech-to-produce-ultra-thin-wafers-with-minimal-silicon-waste/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 16, 2021",New tech to produce ultra-thin wafers with minimal silicon waste,"Scientists from the Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) and Chungbuk National University (CBNU) have developed a new manufacturing process for ultra-thin silicon wafers. They claim their new approach could reduce the cost of crystalline solar cells by half.
Compared to conventional epitaxial processes, which usually produce significant amounts of silicon waste, the new technique effectively delivers ultra-thin wafers without sacrificing any of the substrates, according to the researchers. It is based on plasma-assisted epitaxial (plasma-epi) growth and subsequent hydrogen annealing.
Plasma-epi growth has been previously uaed in solar cell manufacturing, but it resulted in devices with high defect densities and porous structures. Although efforts were made to inhibit material growth and reduce internal defects and porosity, this method never reached the efficiency levels required for commercial production.
The South Korean group took a completely opposite approach and decided to use plasma-epi with the aim of increasing the defect density and maximizing the porosity of the material. By using this “reverse” method, they were able to control the porous structure of silicon and peel off the single crystal silicon wafer grown on it.
“The wafer thickness can be independently controlled during the bulk growth after the formation of plasma-epi seed layer,” the researchers explained.
Thi control strategy of the silicon's nanoporous structure allows the nano-sized pores to merge with each other when subject to high temperatures, so they move to the substrate's surface and disappear. This self-organized nanogap created in the middle of the parent substrate is reportedly easy to remove. And once the ultra-thin wafer is peeled off, the parent substrate can be reused indefinitely without damage. In conventional processes, the parent substrate is gradually lost after several peeling processes, which results in higher manufacturing costs.
“The developed technology is based on chemical vapor deposition, which is widely used in various processes to produce semiconductors, solar cells, displays, and sensors,” said CBNU researcher Kim Ga-hyeon. “Given the high scalability of plasma-epi and its compatibility with conventional semiconductor process, the proposed bottom-up wafer fabrication process will open a new route to developing advanced silicon electronics.”

The products will be shipped from January 2022 to December 2024. The value of the supply contract is estimated at around RMB6.53 billion ($995.1 million).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/16/how-to-convert-coal-mine-goaves-into-pumped-hydro-storage-facilities/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 16, 2021",How to convert coal mine goaves into pumped hydro storage facilities,"Researchers from the Chongqing University in China and Chinese investments firm Shaanxi Investment Group Co., Ltd have proposed to use abandoned coal mine goaves as upper and underground water reservoirs for pumped hydro storage (PHS) facilities in combination with large-scale solar and wind facilities.
“During extraction of mineral resources from underground deposits, shafts and extensive galleries are excavated,” the academics explained. “These underground voids are usually left to be flooded, but often perpetual costs related to pumping to keep a safe water level or water treatment have to be maintained, becoming long-term liabilities.”
Currently, according to their analysis, there are 3,868 closed coal mines in China that could eventually be considered for this repurposing concept. In order to assess if these sites are suitable for pumped-hydro storage, three main aspects should be considered: storable volume; usable volume; and fluid exchange. Once these values are determined, the performance of a goaf pumped-hydro storage facility should also be evaluated by considering meteorological data such as solar radiation and wind speed.
A pumped-hydro facility built on these sites should consist of an upper reservoir or a surface reservoir and a lower reservoir located at the underground mine goaves. The ideal altitude difference between the upper and lower reservoir is indicated at around 100m.
The system would rely on conventional components such as reversible hydraulic pumps, turbines, and penstocks, and it would be operated in combination with conventional utility-scale wind and solar power plants. “When the electricity generated by wind and solar power cannot satisfy the demand, the stored water will be released to produce electricity and fill the demand gap,” the Chinese group explained. “The penstocks, surge tank, and a variety of connecting tunnels/rooms provide ancillary services for the system’s smooth operation.”
The scientists emphasized that the storage capacity of a similar scheme would depend not only on the goaf volume but also on the interspace between the fractured rock blocks that pile up within the goaf itself after mining activities are abandoned. “During charging and discharging, water and air would exchange, and the permeability within the goaf determines whether the water or air can flow in and out smoothly or not,” they said, noting that the flow velocity of water and air within the reservoir is determined by pressure gradient and permeability.
“To ensure sufficient outputs of turbine and pumps, the maximum water flow should be guaranteed,” they added. “As the permeability decreases, the saturation line tends to decline during injection and rise during releasing, implying a less water volume injected during filling and released during draining the reservoir, and hence a smaller usable capacity of the goaf reservoirs.” The system design also includes the construction of ventilation shafts at 2 m above the maximum water level in the reservoir for air smooth exchange during water pumping and injecting.
A simulation conducted with this model showed a pumped-hydro facility built in a depleted coal mine may ensure an average system efficiency of 82.8% during a year. The regulated energy per volume (REPV) is estimated at 2.82 kW·h/m3.
The researchers concluded that using abandoned coal mine goaves for pumped hydro facilities is technically feasible; however, they warned that locations with low pH value should be avoided, as acid goaf water could corrode the plant components, and release metal ions, or heavy metals, thus damaging the underground structures and polluting the surrounding water bodies. “Necessary purification treatments are very important to the water safety,” they said.
The system design is described in the study Underground Hydro-Pumped Energy Storage Using Coal Mine Goafs: System Performance Analysis and a Case Study for China, which was recently published in Frontiers in Earth Science.

“Costs will resume their downward trend from 2023 once the polysilicon capacity levels up with other nodes of the module supply chain and power restrictions ease up in China for other key module materials like polymers and solar glass,” the analyst said in a statement. “Increased module efficiencies projected on module technology roadmaps i.e., passivated contact cells (TOPCon) or Heterojunction (HJT) will also contribute to lower ($/W) production costs from 2023 onwards.”
Despite this difficult cost environment, global solar PV installations are predicted to increase by about 20% in 2022 to reach a record annual capacity of over 200 GW for the first time.
According to the IHS Markit, PV systems costs increased by 4% year-on-year globally, which is having a significant impact only on the utility scale segment, with many projects being halted or delayed across the entire planet. It expects that the current high costs of freight and shipping delays will continue well into 2022, which would particularly impact the economics of international projects.
“There is significant appetite across global markets to invest in and develop solar installations, but the supply chain is just not ready to meet this level of demand, it needs time to adjust,” said IHS Markit analyst, Edurne Zoco. We have seen this most clearly in the polysilicon market, which will continue to be a bottleneck for solar PV growth into 2022, until planned new capacity is ramped up from 2023 onwards.”
The picture for solar distributed generation, by contrast, seems brighter, as large volumes are currently being deployed as an answer to skyrocketing electricity prices across big economies such as China, India, the United States, and Europe. “The strong growth of the distributed generation i.e., residential, commercial and industrial (C&I) sector has been one of the success stories of solar PV in 2021—boosted by the fuel crisis and surging electricity prices, particularly in markets across Europe,” said IHS Markit research manager, Josefin Berg.

The ambitious scheme, which would be the country's largest solar project, has now acquired a new partner with Innosea, a French independent technical engineering firm specializing in the field of marine renewable energies, which will act as a provider of support for wave and anchoring studies.
“The Nam Theun 2 solar project is exciting as it can demonstrate cost and energy potential from integrating FPV with existing power plants and technologies. Energy clustering of solar with hydropower is believed to potentially boost electrical output of existing plants by 10%, without occupying land space,” said Benoit Briere, senior project manager at Innosea. “It’s also a privilege to support Laos in the development of what is projected to be one of the world’s largest floating PV plants.”
The solar plant will cover an area of 3.2km2, which corresponds to less than 1% of the reservoir’s area at full supply level. It will be operated in conjunction with the 1,080 MW hydropower plant in order to enable optimized water utilization and, according to the project developers, will result in a 6% increase in the total generation of the Nam Theun 2 facility.
EDF had signed a project development agreement (PDA) with the government of Laos in mid-July.
According to recent analysis from U.S.-based NGO Viet Ecology Foundation, 11,400 MW of floating solar-with-storage (FSS) is technically feasible in Laos and would generate an equal amount of power (15,000 GWh/year) – and could likely be implemented at a lower dollar-per-kilowatt-hour cost – than the three hydropower projects currently under development in the country – Pak Lay, Pak Beng and Luang Prabang. Overall, Laos plans to build nine hydroelectric projects on the main part of the Mekong River.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Laos had an installed PV capacity of around 22 MW at the end of 2020.

Bidders who failed to win projects under the Indian government’s production-linked incentives scheme for solar manufacturing still stand a chance to secure funding, because the authorities are providing USD 3.2 billion of additional funding for the subsidy program.
Power Minister RK Singh recently told the PTI news agency that the government has approved the ministry’s proposal to expand funding. The additional funds will help more manufacturers under the incentives scheme, paving the way for India to become a solar panel manufacturing hub and exporter.
Jindal India Solar, Shirdi Sai Electricals and Reliance New Energy Solar have already secured funds under the incentives scheme to support gigawatt-scale production of high-efficiency solar modules. Other companies – including Adani Infrastructure, First Solar, Coal India, Larsen & Toubro, Renew Solar, Tata Power, and Waaree Energies – are on the waiting list to obtain similar support. The waiting list will be valid for six months after the announcement of successful bids.
Singh said that at present, India has a solar module production capacity of 8.8 GW and cell capacity of 2.5 GW. The incentives scheme tender drew bids for 54.5 GW of solar equipment production capacity.

France's Ministry of Ecological Transition has published the results of the tenth and final round of the CRE4 tender scheme for ground-mounted solar installations.
A total of 80 projects, totaling 636.7 MW, were selected by the French authorities, which hoped to allocate 700 MW through the procurement exercise.
The tender concluded with an average final price of €0.05665/kWh ($0.06475), which is 3% lower than that of the previous tender of the same kind, which had recorded an increase in the average price of 4.7%.
For the category of projects exceeding 5 MW in size, which secured a capacity of 440.4 MW, the average final price was €0.05232/kWh. The most powerful plant will be built by French developer Neoen, in Romilly, in the Aube department, with a capacity of 42.79 MW. It will rehabilitate an old military airfield. It is followed in size by the Fontenet 3 plant, in the Charente-Maritime department – under development by Saintonge Energies, a subsidiary of BayWa r.e. France – with a power of 40.06 MW.
For the category of installations between 500 kW and 5 MW, the final average price was €0.06340/kWh and the allocated capacity reached 112.35 MW.
For installations on car park shades, the average final price was €0.08229/kWh and the assigned capacity was 35.14 MW. Among the largest projects, Neoen will build a 6.7 MWp photovoltaic power plant project in the parking lot at Metz-Nancy-Lorraine (Moselle) airport. Apex will build a 5.83 MW car park shade in the Bas-Rhin department of Alsace, and Urbasolar will install a 5.28 MW carport.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/16/us-solar-market-in-flux/,"MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",,"NOVEMBER 16, 2021",US solar market in flux,"From pv magazine 11/2021
The pipeline shown in the bottom-right chart includes projects that have been approved, are currently under construction, or are completed or operational. These are baseline projects incorporated in IHS Markit’s installation forecast. The 2022 pipeline for utility-scale solar projects planned for completion in the United States is nearly 50% greater than in 2021 and 2023. This buildup is the combined effect of pandemic-related supply chain impacts, the solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) schedule and multiple Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notices regarding continuity safe harbor deadlines, as well as other factors such as state renewable portfolio standard (RPS) requirements and corporate power purchase agreements (CPPAs).
Previously, companies operated under the assumption that the ITC continuity safe harbor placed a 2023 in-service deadline for projects that started construction in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Developers originally planned for completion in 2022 to meet the in-service deadline in 2023. In the past, the anticipation leading up to the ITC step-down in 2016, prior to its extension in late 2015, resulted in a large, accumulated pipeline. Similarly, the 2022 pipeline reflects anticipated ITC step-downs, with a significant buildup of ITC 30 and ITC 26 projects in a few key states.
Texas, California, Ohio, Indiana, and Nevada constitute 39 GW or 59% of U.S. installations in the 2022-23 pipeline.
Texas, California, and Nevada remain key drivers of the U.S. utility-scale market. In Texas, more than one-quarter of the pipeline over the next two years is from corporate PPAs where the purchaser is a non-utility entity. Primoris and Mortenson have EPC contracts for 20% of the Texas pipeline. In California, Recurrent Energy, CIM Group, 8minutenergy, Clearway Energy Group, and EDP Renewables will be the primary owners for over half of the 2022-23 pipeline. In Nevada, NV Energy will be the PPA electricity purchaser for half of the state’s installations, while half of the 2022-23 pipeline will be owned by EDF Group and Primergy.
With comparatively moderate solar resources, the burgeoning Ohio and Indiana markets will see significant installations driven by unique circumstances in each state. In Ohio, despite reductions to the state’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS), and other recent policies, corporate solar PPAs and the closure of economically challenged coal plants continue to give the opportunity to solar. In July, Vistra said it will accelerate the retirement of its coal-fired Zimmer Power Plant to mid-2022 due to the plant’s inability to meet the price point in the PJM capacity auction for the 2022-23 period.
Also in Ohio, Amazon Web Services has signed 2 GW of solar PPAs to power its facilities. The 2022 installation pipeline in Indiana is also being driven by retirements of uneconomic, aging coal-fired resources. Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) is retiring two coal-fired units at its Schahfer Generating Station by the end of 2021, and the remaining two units by May 2023. This is part of NIPSCO’s plan to retire all of its coal-fired generating units by 2028.
Solar PV installations were expected to peak in 2022 because developers had to satisfy the 2023 in-service deadline to capture the ITC. However, the IRS extended the ITC safe harbor period from four to six years for solar PV projects that began construction between 2016 and 2020, therefore removing the urgency to install in 2022.

Contingent on how companies adapt to inflated freight costs and module supply and policy challenges, many of these solar projects may continue to move forward until they are completed in 2022 and become operational in 2023. However, this huge pipeline of projects in 2022 driven by the ITC timing is also being compounded by supply chain impacts of the pandemic. Component supply challenges due to a global containerized shipping shortage, port congestions, and high component prices due to raw material price increases in early 2021 are likely to cause delays in 2022, especially without the urgency to install in 2022 to meet the in-service deadline.
To add to the uncertainty, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Withhold Release Order (WRO) on silica-based products made by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. has resulted in multiple companies having solar PV modules detained at ports, with no exact data on the volume being detained or the potential pipeline impact. Market drivers such as rising prices for renewable energy certificates, PPAs, and emissions credits are improving the outlook for solar development, but challenges remain in offsetting inflated freight costs and disruptions to the module supply chain.
IHS Markit’s forecast does not include approved projects without PPAs, as projects without a legal obligation to serve customers may seek to defer development to align with the ITC extension to 2025. This does not mean projects lacking PPAs won’t achieve installation by 2022, as projects at the planning stage have already incurred costs and permitting and contractual requirements for certain projects may set the pace regardless of any PPA or the ITC extension.
Despite downside risk to the 2022 pipeline, the safe-harbor extension ultimately changes the shape of IHS Markit’s forecast after 2022, increasing total installations between 2023 and 2025.

The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) increased 9.1%, while the S&P 500 only increased by 4.3% and the DJIA only increased by 3.9%. Senator Joe Manchin informed the White House and legislative leaders that he will not support the Clean Electricity Performance Program, consequentially discouraging U.S. utilities to switch to clean energy sources such as solar. Meanwhile, solar demand continues to follow a promising track, yet the supply chain has been unable to keep up.

Despite the industry’s short-term optimism, pricing throughout the whole upstream chain is rising due to a new disruption: China’s coal scarcity and limited silicon metal supplies. The abrupt impact in the solar world has been the increase in silicon metal and polysilicon pricing adding to the already existing inflation within the solar space. As a result, certain module providers have postponed or canceled deliveries to India. Furthermore, there is a module supply shortage in Australia. However, we expect that this particular issue will be alleviated in part, once regions in China where manufacturing is concentrated receive new emission and power consumption quotas.
The danger of project push-backs is still a concern. Some developers are delaying project starts scheduled for the first quarter of 2022 due to persistently high input costs and the withhold release order limitations on modules. As a result of there being limited modules, some engineering, procurement, and construction providers are sending workers home. Despite the potential for project delays until 2023, some developers are still planning to install piles/trackers in 2022 and may delay module supply, resulting in prolonged commercial operation dates.
We also see the potential of U.S. renewable incentives being slightly altered. There is a strong possibility that the existing 10-year language for the Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC) extension could be decreased by two to five years. Nonetheless, we continue to believe an extension to be a considerable win for the sector. Regarding the time frame, chances are the budget reconciliation bill will not get passed until later in the year.

VSUN Energy, the renewable energy generation and storage subsidiary of Perth-based miner Australian Vanadium Limited (AVL), will install a standalone power system based on vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) energy storage technology at IGO’s nickel operation in Western Australia’s remote Fraser Range region.
The standalone power system will be based around a 300 kWh VRFB supplied by Spanish battery manufacturer E22, a subsidiary of global solar and battery specialist Gransolar Group. The companies did not disclose any other details, but the VRFB-based standalone power system will likely be paired with a ground-mounted solar PV array, with a diesel-fueled generator serving as backup.
The VRFB-based standalone power system will complement the 6.7 MW solar PV array that has been helping to power operations at the nickel-copper-cobalt mine site since 2019.
AVL said the new standalone power system, which will be used to power a bore pump on-site, has been designed to provide a 100% renewable energy supply for much of the year. However, the initial 12-month trial will target a total renewable penetration of 85% to 90%.
The VRFB system will be initially issued free to IGO with ownership or rental options commencing after the 12-month trial period.
AVL Managing Director Vincent Algar said the initiative is part of the company’s strategy to further develop the market for the battery storage technology in Australia with the optimisation of power for pumps a key area of focus for VSUN across mining and agricultural markets.
“Working with IGO on this project will accelerate the objectives of the companies and broader mining industry towards carbon neutrality,” he said. “The robustness of VRFB energy storage makes it perfectly suited to the tough environments found on many Australian mine sites.”
AVL, which is developing the Australian Vanadium Project south of Meekatharra in Western Australia, said vanadium flow batteries offer heavy-duty energy storage and are designed for use in high-utilisation applications such as being coupled with industrial-scale solar PV generation for distributed, low-emissions energy projects.
Energy is stored in a non-flammable, liquid electrolyte and the batteries can be cycled tens of thousands of times with virtually no degradation in capacity. With a lifespan exceeding 20 years, VRFB technology has longevity that matches renewable energy generation sources such as solar PV. The technology has a wide operating temperature range, giving it the ability to be deployed in all regions of Australia.
Algar said VSUN is in discussions with other mining companies and customers in the agricultural sector and will be able to share the findings from the IGO project with them.
“The installation of an SPS based on vanadium technology for pumping applications enables diesel to be almost entirely eliminated, helping reduce overall carbon emissions and providing reliable green power,” he said. “We look forward to trialling and then duplicating this system based on an Australian invention and with Australian-made vanadium electrolyte from AVL.”
The installation of the VRFB-based SPS at IGO’s Nova site, about 360 kilometers southeast of Kalgoorlie, is expected to reduce energy costs and offer substantial reductions in operating hours for service personnel.
IGO Chief Operating Officer Matt Dusci said it would also aid the company’s emission reduction ambitions.
“IGO’s strategic focus is on those products that are critical to enabling clean energy solutions, to create a better planet,” he said. “We aspire to be carbon neutral across our business and to do this, in part, by leveraging renewable energy solutions and innovation to reduce emissions at our remote exploration and mining operations.”
The announcement of the SPS trial comes just 24 hours after AVL revealed it had signed an MOU with E22 with the intention of supplying vanadium for the manufacture of the Spanish company’s next-generation VRFBs. The MOU also includes an agreement with VSUN for the sale of E22’s VRFBs in Australia.
Algar said E22 manufactures small to large-size VRFBs, with the VCUBE50 well suited to the development of VSUN’s standalone power system. The smallest in E22’s VCUBE series, the 50 kW battery offers four hours of energy storage.
“What attracted us to E22, in particular, was the midsize VRFB that they are able to supply and the credibility offered through their parent company,” he said. “Small to medium-sized commercial applications, in addition to mining and agricultural industries, require a system that is smaller than the majority of the VRFB manufacturers currently supply. The requirement is for a robust and reliable system that can be increased in size and redeployed as needed.”

The U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has released its annual cost breakdown of installed solar photovoltaic and battery storage systems.
The U.S. Solar Photovoltaic System and Energy Storage Cost Benchmark: Q1 2021 report details installed costs for PV systems as of the first quarter of 2021. It says that costs continued to fall for residential, commercial rooftop, and utility-scale PV systems by 3%, 11%, and 12%, respectively, compared to last year.
In a change from previous years’ reports, balance-of-systems costs have increased or remained flat across sectors this year. However, the report said this increase in balance of systems cost was offset by a 19% reduction in module costs, causing overall prices to continue their decade-long decline.
The report’s authors used a cost-modeling approach that accounts for all system and project development costs incurred during installation to model the costs for residential, commercial, and utility-scale PV systems, with and without energy storage. They also modeled typical installation techniques and business operations from an installed-cost perspective. NREL said this approach helps ensure that hardware costs reflect the actual purchase price of components as well as the sales price paid to the installer, including profits. The benchmarks assume a business environment unaffected by the novel coronavirus pandemic and represent national averages.
The major cost drivers that helped reduce the system installation costs of PV and energy storage systems in the first quarter of this year were lower module costs, increased module efficiency, and lower battery pack costs, said NREL’s solar and storage techno-economic analyst, Vignesh Ramasamy.
Starting with the 2020 PV benchmark report, NREL began including solar+storage and standalone energy storage costs in its annual reports. The 2021 benchmark report finds continued cost declines across residential, commercial, and industrial PV-plus-storage systems, with the greatest cost declines for utility-scale systems (up to a 12.3% reduction). Standalone storage systems also experienced cost declines.
A major component of total installed system costs is the cost of the PV modules. In a second report, Photovoltaic Module Technologies: 2020 Benchmark Costs and Technology Evolution Framework Results, NREL researchers calculated a minimum sustainable price (MSP) – the price necessary to support a sustainable business over the long term – for modules. The report calculated that price by using bottom-up manufacturing cost analysis and applying a gross margin of 15%.
The report benchmarked three established, mass-produced PV technologies as well as two technologies that NREL described s “promising” and that currently are under development or in pilot production.
Crystalline silicon (c-Si) dominates the current PV market, and its MSPs are the lowest – $0.25 to $0.27/watt across the c-Si technologies analyzed. Cadmium telluride (CdTe) modules have a slightly higher MSP ($0.28/watt), and the copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS) MSP takes a still bigger step up ($0.48/watt), largely as a result of higher labor, equipment, and facility costs.
The two developing technologies the report considers are III-V and perovskite PV technologies. At $77/watt, the III-V MSP benchmark is higher than the benchmarks for established technologies, which has kept III-V PV technology in niche markets, such as space and terrestrial concentrator applications. NREL said this challenge is reflected in the III-V road map, in which several potential cost reductions still result in a long-term projection of $20/watt, some two orders of magnitude higher than the long-term MSPs of the other technologies. However, III-V modules could still be worth pursuing, the report said, because they are the highest-efficiency PV products on the market. The current highest research-cell efficiency is 47.1% for a multijunction III-V device, and even higher efficiencies are possible.
The report also offered NREL’s first techno-economic assessment of perovskite PV modules. The estimated MSP for a single-junction sheet-to-sheet perovskite module at a small production scale is $0.38/watt, with potential cost reductions projected to reduce the MSP over the long term to $0.18/watt, assuming performance can be improved without driving up costs. Perovskites can also be combined with other PV technologies in multijunction configurations. The report estimated an MSP of $0.31/watt for perovskite-on-Si tandem modules in early production based on pilot production results.
Cost reductions from economies of scale as production grows and the accumulation of manufacturing experience are also important, but they are not included in NREL’s cost-reduction road maps. Other module price drivers not captured in this analysis include global supply and demand fluctuations, domestic policies related to PV deployment and manufacturing, trade policies and corporate strategies.
