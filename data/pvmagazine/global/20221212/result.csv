Spanish President Pedro Sánchez has met in Alicante, Spain, with French President Emmanuel Macron and the Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa to discuss the H2Med energy interconnection project – the first green corridor to connect the Iberian Peninsula with the city of Marseille, France.
This meeting, which included European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, took place at the EU Intellectual Property Office. The leaders met in response to a commitment made by the three countries in Brussels in October. The three leaders agreed to work together to launch a transnational hydrogen pipeline.
“The work carried out over the last month by the technical teams of the three governments has made it possible to outline the objectives of H2Med, and has specified that the project has two fundamental parts,” said Sánchez. “For one side, the route from Portugal to Spain, specifically from Celorico da Beira to Zamora; and, on the other hand, the route from Spain to France through the Mediterranean, from Barcelona to Marseille.”
According to the preliminary technical specifications of the H2Med project, the section between Celorico, Portugal, and Zamora, Spain, will extend across 248 kilometers. The estimated cost is €350 million ($369.5 million). For the Barcelona-Marseille section, costs are expected to rise to €2.5 billion for a 455-kilometer connection.
The project outlined this seek by the leaders of Spain, France and Portugal in Alicante will be the first major hydrogen corridor in the European Union. Although it was initially envisioned to also transport gas, now it will focus solely on green hydrogen, so it falls under the RePowerEU Plan.
The presence of the president of the European Commission at the presentation of the project could be understood as a show of support. Before Dec. 15, 2023, H2Med will be presented as a Project of Common Interest (IPCEI). That will give the developer access to European funding sources such as the “Connecting Europe” facility, which can cover up to 50% of eligible initiatives.
Von der Leyen noted the suitability of the common project. “The H2MED project is heading in the right direction. It has the potential to help us build a European backbone for transporting hydrogen,” she said.
Sánchez has indicated that some of the infrastructure could be in operation by the end of this decade. He confirmed that “it will be capable of transporting 10% of the EU's hydrogen consumption by 2030,” which corresponds to around 2 million tons per year.

Tokyu Land said in a statement that it will build the demonstrator in partnership with Dutch offshore PV specialist SolarDuck and Tokyo-based Everblue Technologies. It said it will provide more details on the project after wrapping up consultations with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's Bureau of Policy Planning. The three companies aim to commercialize the floating solution across Japan in the future.
In 2021, SolarDuck unveiled the first demonstrator project to feature its floating structure technology for solar projects at offshore sites in estuaries, natural harbors, and near-shore sites. It deployed the 64 kW system on an inshore site on the Waal (Rhine) River, near IJzendoorn, Gelderland, the Netherlands.
More recently, SolarDuck agreed to develop a pilot project in the North Sea in cooperation with the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN), and Deltares. The consortium has secured €7.8 million in funding from the Dutch government.
Its floating arrays hold the solar panels more than 3 meters above the surface of the water, and are able to handle coastal sea conditions and hurricane-force winds. The systems are optimized for offshore sites in estuaries and natural harbors, as well as near-shore sites.
The basic floating platforms are triangular structures measuring 16 meters x 16 meters x 16 meters. They resemble offshore floating wind platforms or floating oil platforms. They can be flexibly connected together to form large plants.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/12/aqueous-organic-flow-battery-for-renewables-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 12, 2022",Aqueous organic flow battery for renewables storage,"Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have built a kilowatt-scale aqueous redox flow battery with high-performance organic redox-active molecules.
Flow batteries (FB) have started to attract widespread attention as a large-scale energy storage solution, due to their high security and effectiveness. In particular, aqueous organic flow batteries (AOFBs), which use structurally tunable and eco-friendly redox-active molecules, are getting more attention.
“However, most organic molecules in AOFBs are prone to be oxidized especially by air, resulting in irreversible capacity decay, which hinders their further applications,” researcher Changkun Zhang told pv magazine.
Zhang and his team sought to solve this issue by using an electrolyte based on methylthioninium chloride, which is also known as methylene blue (MB).
“We optimized electrolyte composition by tuning the interaction between different components in the electrolyte, thereby increasing the battery capacity,” said researcher Xianfeng Li, noting that the MB concentration in the electrolyte did not exceed 1.9 mol (M).
The scientists assembled 10 units of 1000 cm2 AOFBs stacks and obtained stacks with a discharge power of over 1 kW and a stable cycling capacity for 32 days. The stacks were assembled with MB concentrations of 0.1 M and 0.5 M, respectively.
“The 0.1 M V-MB stack exhibited discharge capacities of 121, 117 and 112 Ah with coulombic efficiency and energy efficiency of 99.6%, 99.7%, 99.8% and 82.5%, 75.1%, 69.2% at the current densities of 40, 60, and 80 mA cm -2 in the initial cycle (Fig. 4b),” they explained. “The utilization of the MB electrolyte at 40 mA cm -2 is around 95%.”
The battery showed a capacity of 80 mA cm-2 for over 500 cycles and also achieved long-life cycle performance after 380 cycles, with a capacity of around 510 Ah at 50 mA cm -2. The researchers said the molecules contributed to the “excellent” stability of the device.
“Although the side reactions of the pristine MB were severe at 70 C, most of the decomposed molecules still retain the redox center with only a slight capacity decay,” they explained.
They presented the battery in “Insight into Air-stable Methylene Blue Catholyte towards kW-scale Practical Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries,” which was recently published in Energy & Environmental Science.
“We found in this work that in the methylene blue (MB) electrolyte, both the oxygen-resistant MB radicals generated by the comproportionation reaction and the reduced MB states in acidic electrolyte displayed much more stable molecular structure,” Li concluded. “Based on this, we also designed the first AOFB stack which would definitely be an important reference for the AOFB practical application.”

The company recently secured €115,000 ($120.950) in funding from Italian state-run investment bank Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) to bring its new technology to market.
“Our new product is intended at creating an all-in-one digital screen powered by photovoltaics,” CEO Fabrizio Chiara told pv magazine. “Every solar panel is potentially an advertising space with Sunspeker’s sticker.”
The company says the stickers can replicate high-definition images while remaining permeable to light. This reportedly ensures that the modules retain between 80% and 90% of their efficiency.
“The loss in power yield can be compensated by the gains coming from ad campaigns,” Chiara said. “Ads of this kind may also be sold at a higher price given the sustainability of the billboards.”
The images processed using Sunspeker's patented process reportedly maintain a high rate of transparency.
“However, as a matter of aesthetic impact, in some cases, the energy efficiency is reduced to 80% so that the solar panel can be more integrated into the environment,” Chiara said. “Currently, we are working to create standard conditions to allow us to scale with some different aesthetic solutions to cover the majority of the cases.”
The adhesive film for the aesthetic covers is a thermoplastic that was developed for outdoor applications. The company said that in the R&D process it focused on sustainability. It sought a solution that was fully recyclable, in line with circular economic principles.
The solar screen technology is still under development and has a “level-six technology readiness level” (TRL 6). The TRL measures the maturity of technology components in a system and is based on a scale from one to nine, with nine representing the most mature technologies for full commercial application.
The company manufactured the final product and is now ready to commercialize it in Canavese, near Turin, northern Italy. It hopes to raise another €450,000 via new funding rounds. It said it is currently implementing the first pilot projects.
“In the Veneto region, at the end of November, we installed the first residential pilot project of the solar rooftop with a 'tile' texture in partnership with Energy Saving, an energy company based in Treviso that believed in the Sunspeker mission and technology,” said Chiara.

The government originally proposed setting the size limit at 2,500 square meters, while The Greens had asked for this threshold to be reduced to 500 square meters. Initially, the proposal considered the size limit in terms of parking spaces.
France is a pioneer in the development of solar carports. Since the inception of solar energy development in the country, projects in parking areas were always allowed to participate in tenders for renewable energy.
Last year, SNCF Gares and Connexions, a unit of French railway operator SNCF, launched a tender for the deployment of solar carports at 156 train stations.
The largest solar carport in France is a 29 MW installation built by Engie Green, a unit of French energy giant Engie, at the factory of car manufacturer Stellantis in Sochaux, in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region in eastern France.

The ministry selected five solar plants with a combined capacity of 860 MW in the auction, with the final average price coming in at ZAR 0.49048/kWh, up 8% from the fifth round, when the average price reached ZAR 0.45423/kWh
The lowest two bids of ZAR 0.46050 were offered for two 150 MW solar plants in the North West province, while a bid of ZAR 0.48650 was submitted for a 240 MW facility in Free State province. Developers also offered bids of ZAR 0.49890 and ZAR 0.54000 for 200 MW in Free State and a 120 MW plant in North West.
“This is indicative of the global economic challenges experienced over the last two years resulting in increased input costs across the entire value chain,” the ministry said in a statement. “The total investment attracted through the five projects is ZAR 12.1 billion.”
The South African authorities had originally planned to allocate up to 1 GW of solar and 3.2 GW of wind power in the auction.
“The department received onshore wind bid responses amounting to 4,116 MW for the Bid Window 6, all of which are located in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape supply areas,” the ministry said, in reference to the unallocated wind capacity quota. “Following the confirmation from Eskom during the evaluation that no grid capacity was available to connect any proposed onshore wind projects in these supply areas, the department could unfortunately not award any of the wind projects up to the allocated 3 200 MW under this bid window.”
“It's a disappointing announcement from Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe for Bid Window 6 considering South Africa is about to conclude its worst year on record of loadshedding and just missed another opportunity to deploy both wind and solar PV projects at scale which are still the cheapest and quickest to build power projects in the country,” Chris Ahlfeldt, the founder of Blue Horizon Energy Consulting Services, told pv magazine. “It will be interesting to see how Eskom and government respond to the clear need for a coordinated approach to allocating grid access going forward as not all power projects are equal in terms of emissions, cost, supply profiles, or local socio-economic benefits.”
The fifth round of the REIPPPP scheme was launched in March 2021. Overall, the authorities allocated 2.6 GW of renewable energy capacity across 25 projects, ranging in size from 75 MW to 140 MW. The fifth round's lowest bid of ZAR 0.34425 was submitted for a 124 MW wind facility to be built in Hantam, in the Northern Cape region. For solar, the lowest price was ZAR 0.37479, which was offered for six 75 MW solar parks set for construction in Tokologo, an administrative area in the Lejweleputswa District of the Free State region.
The sixth and fifth procurement exercises are part of a plan to tender almost 12 GW of capacity. The latest round follows the recent publication of South Africa’s new Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). The IRP aims for up to 6 GW of new large-scale solar by 2030, as well as up to 6 GW of distributed-generation PV capacity.

JUA Technologies, an agriculture technology startup that manufactures solar-powered crop dehydrators, has received a two-year, $600,000 Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from the US Department of Agriculture to develop its technology.
The goal of the Phase II project, titled Smart Multipurpose Solar Dehydration Device for Value Addition to Specialty Crops, is proof of concept toward product-design improvements and design for the company’s production of a multipurpose solar dryer, called Dehymeleon.
“It is an energy-intensive process with huge operating costs because food dehydrators are typically powered by gas, electricity or fuel oil,” said Dr. Klein E. Ileleji, chief executive officer and co-founder of JUA Technologies, and also a professor of agricultural and biological engineering at Purdue University. “The high operating cost limits the ability of small and midsize growers and processors in the US to produce dehydrated foods. Small growers and processors are vital to the local foods and urban agriculture industry, which is currently a $1 billion and growing industry in the US.”
In developing tropical countries, where post-harvest losses of horticultural produce can be as high as 50%, dehydrating foods using solar energy will not only help support nutrition security but also provide growers an opportunity to increase their income from value-added processing.
Ileleji said dehydrating fruits and vegetables, herbs and spices, and medicinal plants still occurs using primitive, open sun-drying methods on mats or trays that degrade nutrients and reduce food quality.
“While there are a lot of solar dryer designs available in literature and online, none of them have been commercialized or utilized in large numbers,” Ileleji said.
JUA Technologies’ proposed high-efficiency multipurpose solar dehydrator fits the priorities of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and National Institute of Food and Agriculture in four ways:
The USDA SBIR grant will cover four research and development goals. Ileleji said the goals will be addressed by JUA Technologies and contracted manufacturing and product engineering design firms:
In January 2021, Ileleji incorporated Dehytech East Africa Limited as a subsidiary of JUA Technologies. Dehytech is responsible for the import, distribution, marketing, sales and coordination of training and technical services for JUA Technologies’ solar food dryers, Dehytray and other products serving the East Africa region.
In 2019, JUA Technologies received an initial $100,000 SBIR Phase I grant from the USDA and a $50,000 investment from Elevate Ventures.
This year the U.S. Small Business Administration recognized Ileleji as the Indiana and the Great Lakes Regional Exporter of the Year, for the deployment of its portable solar dehydrator, Dehytray.
“Both the Dehytray and Dehymeleon technologies spun out from a United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-supported effort called Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Food Processing and Post-Harvest Handling,” Ileleji said. “It was a multi-institutional effort led by Purdue University to reduce postharvest loss, promote economic growth, improve nutrition and enhance food security in Feed the Future target countries.
West Lafayette, Indiana-based JUA Technologies was formed in 2016 by Dr. Ileleji and wife Dr. Reiko Ileleji  as an affiliate of the Purdue Foundry. The company’s PV-enabled dehydrating technologies are designed for households, small and mid-sized agriculture processes and growing.
Its first product, the Dehytray, has been sold in 28 states as well as more than 10 countries, and retails for about $139.50 on the company’s website and various retailers such as Walmart. In 2017, the company’s prototype technology was among the Top 10 innovations to receive awards at the first All-African Post-Harvest Congress and Exhibit, held in Nairobi, Kenya.

Researchers from UNSW have discovered a low-cost sulfur-based additive that can boost the stability of perovskite solar cells without compromising efficiency. The 1-DDT (Dodecanethiol) additive has a “multifunction” – something which came as a surprise to the UNSW School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering team. On top of stabilizing the lithium used in the hole transport layer of perovskite cells to achieve high efficiencies, the additive also induces oxidation and prevents water ingression – both features which add to stability.
“This 1-DDT locks lithium in that layer, and I think thats a major contribution and a major underlying mechanism to make this stable,” Professor Xiaojing Hao told pv magazine Australia.
Perovskite cells fabricated with this novel additive were able to maintain more than 90% of the initial efficiency after operating at maximum power point under one sun illumination for 1,000 hours, and more than 93% of the initial efficiency after staying at open circuit condition under one sun illumination for 2,000 hours. This reported stability result is the best in Australia and among the highest in the world.
The results of the research have now been published in Nature Photonics and have been co-authored by Professor Martin Green, famously known as the “father” of modern solar cells.
While perovskites’ high efficiencies are proven, “everyone still has concerns in terms of long term stability,” said Hao.

“EIT InnoEnergy is joined by SolarPower Europe and the European Solar Manufacturing Council on the alliance’s steering committee,” it said. “EIT InnoEnergy will lead the alliance in its ambitions to re-develop, de-risk and accelerate the PV industry in Europe across all segments of the value chain to create its competitive position in the context of booming demand for solar PV in Europe and globally.”
Dries Acke, policy director at SolarPower Europe, described the emergence of the EU Solar PV Industry Alliance as the “coming of age” of European manufacturing.
“The alliance means funding can get to the right projects, but we’ll be cut off at the knees if we don’t have a dedicated solar fund for the alliance to use,” said Acke.
The alliance aims to increase Europe's solar module manufacturing capacity from around 4.5 GW at present to 30 GW by 2025. It is also expected to help the EU to surpass 320 GW of newly installed solar capacity by 2025, and almost 60 GW by 2030.

The prime minister of Portugal, António Costa, has launched the Simplex Ambientales program, which is a package of measures to change the environmental rules for the development of hydrogen and renewable energy projects.
Under the new provisions, hydrogen installations and PV projects that occupy surfaces of less than 100 hectares, as well as wind turbines that are separated by more than 2 kilometers, will not need environmental approval. Projects in protected areas will not be entitled to this exemption.
Costa said the measures will support the Portuguese government's goal for 80% of energy production to come from renewable sources by 2026.
“The simplified environmental package reduces bureaucracy without diminishing protection,” said Costa.
At the end of 2021, renewables accounted for 59% of Portugal's energy mix.
“These actions respond to the main environmental challenges we face and contribute to the fight against climate change,” said Minister of  Energy Duarte Cordeiro. “We simplify, but we do not leave it unprotected.2

The solar facilities will sell power to NTT Anode Energy, a unit of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), under a 30-year PPA.
“While 30 years is a long horizon, the vast majority of investors said they felt comfortable because of the issuer’s exceptionally strong credit ratings, ” a Goldman Sachs spokesperson told pv magazine.
This is the first time that a green bond linked to a solar PPA has been issued in Japan.
“In September 2013, GS structured the first rated securitization of solar energy globally, through our JRE Mega Solar Project Bond Trust 1,” the spokesperson said. “This first-of-kind green project bond transaction led the way to the development of a pipeline of similar project bonds to more efficiently fund renewable energy throughout Japan. To date the firm has arranged more than JPY 100 billion in green project bond financing in Japan.”
Under current Japanese regulations, corporate PPAs must involve electric utilities, except for on-site PPAs. Both physical and virtual PPAs are allowed. Under physical PPAs, electricity buyers pay fixed fees to generators through retailers, including “sleeving” and management fees.
