“The program is rather unexpected given the lack of such in [Thailand’s Power Development Plan] 2018-37,” Moritz Sticher, a senior adviser at Berlin-based consulting firm Apricum, told pv magazine.
The regulation introduces a 25-year FIT of THB 2,1679 ($0.057)/kWh for solar and a 25-year FIT of THB 2,8331/kWh for solar plus storage.
“The FIT tariff will certainly require some sort of mechanism of tariff adjustment over the term until 2030 given the unknown costs situation by then,” said Sticher.
The quota for solar will be 100 MW per year from 2024 to 2030. For solar and storage, it will be 190 MW in 2024, 290 MW in 2025, 258 MW in 2026, 440 MW in 2028, 310 in 2029, and 390 MW in 2030.
“The total solar and solar plus storage quotas are not really ambitious and since a single project can be up to 90 MW, there will be only a few projects every year,” said Sticher.
Apricum says the scheme will probably be heavily oversubscribed, due to the high number of uncompleted projects in past programs, the attractive tariff, and the large number of market participants. To apply, solar producers must be 51% Thai-owned, which “really limits participation to already established (mainly Thai) players or high-risk takers with flexibility in the legal structuring,” according to Sticher.
Applications will be prescreened according to readiness of land, technology, funding, and project planning. The highest-scoring applications will then be allocated to reach targeted annual capacities according to the allocated quotas. Solar and solar plus storage rank third and fourth after biogas and wind.
Thailand currently has 3.47 GW of installed solar capacity, according to Apricum. The country has updated its 2037 solar targets by reducing the solar capacity target to 8.7 GW and keeping the target for floating solar at 2.73 GW.

(PG&E) has secured approval to establish the first vehicle-to-grid (V2G) export compensation mechanism in the United States for commercial EV charging customers. The new export rate structure in its California service area was agreed between PG&E and the Vehicle-Grid Integration Council, Electrify America LLC, and the Public Advocates Office at the California Public Utilities Commission. Commercial EV owners will receive upfront incentives to help offset fleet costs, while encouraging vehicles to export power to support the grid during peak demand periods. The charging equipment will be paired with stationary energy storage systems, which will be available to support the grid and provide backup power to charge vehicles during grid outages. PG&E says more than 420,000 EVs have been sold in its service area, representing one in six EVs in the United States.
Sono Motors has brought its Sion EV for a seven-city US tour ahead of its expected delivery next year. The Sion is marketed as the world’s first affordable solar EV, with a price tag of about €25,000 ($24,700). Its outer shell features 456 solar half-cells to extend the time between charges and enable self-sufficiency on short journeys, according to the Munich-based manufacturer. Sion’s 54 kWh LFP battery will allow for a maximum charging capacity of up to 75 kW (DC) and 11 kW (AC). The vehicle also has an on-board bidirectional charger of up to 11 kW. The company says it has received more than 20,000 private reservations and more than 22,000 pre-orders from fleet operators to date. In partnership with Valmet Automotive, Sono Motors plans to start production in Finland in the second half of 2023, and aims to produce approximately 257,000 vehicles within seven years.
Toyota and Jera have commissioned a second-life battery at the Japanese utility’s Yokkaichi Thermal Power Station. They have combined lithium-ion, nickel metal-hydride and lead-acid batteries into a single system. The 485 kW/1,260 kWh Sweep Energy Storage System was built with batteries reclaimed from electric vehicles (HEV, PHEV, BEV, FCEV) and is connected to the grid to “feed around 100,000 kWh of electricity into the public grid by the middle of the decade.” Its sweep function, developed by Toyota Central R&D Labs, Inc., allows retired EV batteries to be reused regardless of their level of deterioration. It can freely control energy discharge by switching electricity flow on and off through series-connected batteries in microseconds. It also enables direct AC output from the batteries to reduce costs and avoid power loss when converting from AC to DC.
Solar Botanic Trees has agreed to supply UK-based Raw Charging with 200 solar trees for its network of commercial EV charging sites. Deliveries will start in mid-2023 and will finish in 2024. The solar trees feature thin-film cell technology, are 5 meters tall, with a 5-meter dome and 5 kW of output. The order was signed just six weeks after SolarBotanic Trees was launched as a company. “We are currently starting to look at various regional locations for our manufacturing,” says Chris Shelley, SolarBotanic CEO.
Evergrande has started deliveries of the Hengchi 5, its first electric vehicle model. The first 100 customers received their cars on Saturday, the Chinese company said on its official WeChat account. Evergrande plans to shift its parent company’s primary business from real estate to car manufacturing over the next decade. Its goal is to make 1 million vehicles by 2025.
BP Pulse has announced plans for a Gigahub network: a series of large, fast EV-charging hubs to serve taxi fleets in the United States. The first planned location will be built near Los Angeles International Airport in collaboration with Hertz and will be partially funded by a $2 million grant from the California Energy Commission. The initiative aims to mitigate the environmental impact of ride-hailing services in Los Angeles. “Vehicles employed by California’s ride-hailing fleets make up 2.5% of the vehicle population, but consume 30% of all public fast charging,” said Patty Monahan, Lead California Energy Commissioner for Transportation.

It presented its findings in “Circular Economy Priorities for Photovoltaics in the Energy Transition,” which was recently published in PLOS One.
Using the United States as a case study, a group of researchers analyzed 336 scenarios using the in-house PV Circular Economy Tool (PV ICE). They only considered monocrystalline silicon-based modules.
The researchers assessed the impact on new material demand with different module lifetimes, from 15 to 50 years. They also looked at closed-loop recycling, and assumed that the United States will have 1.75 TW of cumulative PV installed capacity by 2050.
The results show that modules with 50-year lifetimes could reduce new material demand by 3% through lower deployment, in comparison with the 35-year baseline scenario. On the other hand, modules with 15-year lifetimes would require an additional 1.2 TW of replacement modules to maintain 1.75 TW of PV capacity by 2050. That would increase new material demand and waste unless over 95% of the module mass was closed-loop recycled, said the researchers
“This requires 100% collection and a high-yield, high-value recycling processes, which presents a technology and management challenge because no PV technology has achieved this level of closed-loop recycling for all component materials,” they said.
They added that with sustainable PV supply chains, there is a tendency to go straight to recycling as the solution, but there are many other circular options to try first, like lifetime extensions. They concluded that “offsetting new material demand can be accomplished in ways other than recycling, including high-yield, high-efficiency, reliable systems (thereby reducing replacement and total deployment needs,) remanufacturing of components, and circular material sourcing.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/31/recycling-key-to-solar-sustainability/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE,SPAIN,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 31, 2022",Recycling key to solar sustainability,"Scientists led by the Public University of Navarra in Spain have conducted a detailed life cycle analysis of solar PV technologies, comparing their impacts in various categories to those of electricity generated by other renewables technologies, as well as fossil fuels or nuclear.
In terms of CO2 and equivalent emissions, the study finds that solar’s impact today is much lower than all coal and gas generation (including with carbon capture), slightly lower than wind and slightly above nuclear. And while the impact level of the latter two is expected to remain at a similar level through to 2050, the study notes much more opportunity for solar to reduce its emissions in this timeframe.
The study, published in Progress in Photovoltaics, finds that land use is the only category where solar can have a comparable to that of fossil fuels, although solar overall would still require less land and have much lower long-term impacts on that land. Improvements to rooftop and otherwise integrated PV generation, as well approaches such as agrivoltaics, are set to improve this in the coming years.
The study still notes, however, that competition for land with food production, as well as public acceptance, should be carefully considered in the planning of new, large-scale PV installations.
The study also examined different solar technologies including crystalline silicon, cadmium telluride and CIGS thin-film, noting that silicon comes with the highest emissions, but others have larger concerns on availability of materials such as indium and tellurium. Silicon PV will have to contend with the availability of silver, but since alternatives to this material are already on offer commercially, the study does not expect this to have a major impact.
The authors also sought to take perovskite solar cells into account, as an emerging PV technology likely to see large-scale production well before 2050. They note that a proper life-cycle assessment for this technology is difficult to conduct, since it is far from clear the exact pathway and material construction it will take. But the presence of lead mean it will likely have a raised impact on human health categories, while the ease of processing would give it potential for very low emissions and environmental impacts.
The study’s other key conclusions are that the concentration of almost all PV materials manufacturing in China could present a further challenge to solar sustainability in the near future, and recommends both collaboration and the establishment of manufacturing in other regions.
And finally the authors note that recycling of PV products is still a major question mark hanging over the industry, and that much work is still needed both to develop new processes to recover more materials from end-of-life products, and to implement these at scale.
“More facilities for dismantling modules are required; and then, either in situ or in other specialized sites to which the dismantled parts could be sent for further treatment, facilities to increase element recovery and specially glass recycling will have to be built,” the paper concludes. “A logistical approach at regional level (e.g., European scale) should also be considered for the end of life of PV modules, with transport to recycling sites being a substantial part of future emissions associated to the PV systems' full life cycle.”

The home construction company has engineered a home to support the 200 kg Bosch 3400i Hydrotop heat pump on its roof. Scotland-based construction contractor Donaldson Timber Systems redesigned the home’s timber frame to accommodate the unit. A second unit will be fitted to an external wall in order to compare its performance against the roof-mounted unit.
“During the research period, we will have people living within the home to test the performance of the heat pump during real-life use. If the unit in the loft performs well, it could create a new way for homeowners to reduce their carbon footprint without compromising on space or aesthetics,” said Jamie Bursnell, group technical and innovations manager for Bellway. “We will be able to compare the data from the two heat pumps to determine the most viable option for the future.”
Darran Burrage – UK new build director at Worcester Bosch, the manufacturer of the heat pumps – said that size and location are key obstacles to converting to a heat pump in existing properties.
“By placing an air source heat pump in the loft of the Future Home, the trial will hopefully pave the way for an alternative location and if successful enable more homeowners to see the technology as a viable greener heating alternative in the future,” said Burrage.
The Future Home project is in its final stages and is expected to welcome guests from 2023. University of Salford researchers will analyze the effectiveness of the heat pumps and study their impact on the cost of living. The project is being built inside a climate-controlled chamber at the university as part of its GBP 16 million ($18.5 million) Energy House 2.0 research project.

Daqo has signed a long-term polysilicon supply agreement with an undisclosed customer. It will provide 432,000 metric tons (MT) of polysilicon to the unnamed buyer from 2023 to 2028. The contract is valued at CNY 130.9 billion ($17.9 billion), based on current polysilicon prices of CNY 303/kg. Daqo posted a net profit of CNY 15.1 billion in the first nine months of 2022, up 237% year on year. It sold 109,500 MT of polysilicon in the January-September period, and expects to produce 30,000 MT to 32,000 MT in the fourth quarter.

The utility said this week that it has added 270 MW of solar capacity since August, to bring to 300 MW the volume added this year as part of the fifth phase of what is planned to be a 5 GW site, operational in 2030.
The AED 2.06 billion ($561 million) fifth phase of the site, near Dubai, will be 60% owned by DEWA. ACWA Power will take 20%, while Gulf Investment Corp. – owned by the governments of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates – will hold the balance. With 600 MW of solar panels generating at the site, the remaining 300 MW of the fifth phase of the project are due online next year, according to DEWA.
The current edition of pv magazine casts an eye over the Asia-Pacific solar markets, considering how cross-border interconnections can drive better resource efficiency, as well as the crucial role microgrids can play in the continuing roll-out of photovoltaics. We also examine the Tango fab being planned in Sicily by Italian energy group Enel as part of Europe's attempts to shore up energy security with a domestic solar supply chain.
The hybrid solar panel-plus-concentrating-solar fourth phase of the project is also incomplete and DEWA offered an update on progress there, too. Some 217 MW of the planned 250 MW of phase-four capacity is now operational, the utility said. To complete the AED 15.8 billion fourth phase of the project, three 200 MW parabolic basins and a 100 MW solar tower will offer 15 hours of thermal storage capacity.
The concentrating solar part of of the fourth phase – which will be owned by DEWA and ACWA Power, plus a 24% stake for the China Silk Road Fund – was originally due to be operational last year. DEWA has not given a date for completion of that stage of the project.
Earlier in October, the utility extended the deadline for bidders competing to develop the next stage. An Oct. 10 deadline for bids for the 900 MW sixth phase of the site has been extended to Nov. 1.
DEWA said the next phase will start generating from the third quarter of 2025 and will be complete in 2027. It has now announced total investments of AED 50 billion for the project. This week it said the 1.83 GW of operational solar capacity at the site is already supplying 12.1% of Dubai's energy needs and that figure is expected to rise to 14% this year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/31/nearly-4-of-us-homes-have-rooftop-solar-installed/,"MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 31, 2022",Nearly 4% of US homes have rooftop solar installed,"From pv magazine USA
According to a new report by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) on residential energy consumption, about 3.7% of US single-family homes generated electricity from small-scale solar arrays in 2020. 
Residential solar buildout varies widely by region. The western United States had the most with 8.9%, followed by the northeast (4.7%), the south (1.7%), and the midwest (1.4%). Commercial solar adoption was also most common in the west, with 3.8% of buildings generating electricity with local solar. This was followed by the northeast (2.5%), the midwest (0.8%), and the south (0.6%).
The presence of small-scale solar on residential and commercial buildings also differed by year of construction, said the report. Buildings constructed after 1980 were more likely to have solar installed. The report showed that 5.7% of households with incomes of more than $150,000 installed solar, while 1.1% of households with incomes less than $20,000 installed solar.
The EIA noted that government-owned buildings are more likely to have small-scale solar generation than non-government ones. Buildings used for public assembly, education, office space, or retail accounted for 61% of all commercial buildings that reported having small-scale solar generation.
Solar adoption in all sectors, from residential to the utility scale, is expected to increase significantly over the next decade. Following the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, a study by Princeton University said solar deployment may accelerate from 2020 rates of 10 GW of capacity added per year to nearly five times as much by 2024, adding 49 GW of utility-scale solar each year. Solar deployment may be well over 100 GW per year by 2030, said Princeton.
Investment in solar could reach $321 billion in 2030, nearly double the figure of $177 billion expected under current policy. The act is expected to lead to nearly $3.5 trillion in cumulative capital investment in new American energy supply through the next decade, said the report.
Annual US energy expenditures are expected to fall by at least 4% in 2030 under the act, a savings of nearly $50 billion dollars per year for households, businesses and industry. This translates into hundreds of dollars in annual energy cost savings for U.S. households. Tax credits, rebates, and federal investments in the Act would shift costs from energy bills to the progressive federal tax base.

Sales increased by 127.8% on the year to $2.74 billion. Its net profit in the third quarter was $77.3 million.
Xiande Li, the CEO of Jinko Solar, said he expects China alone to see more than 40 GW of photovoltaic installations in the fourth quarter. He said this means that polysilicon prices will be high, but module prices will remain stable for now.
Li said that Jinko Solar has reached full production capacity for TOPCon solar cells, at 16 GW. Now, it aims to narrow the cost gap between n-type and p-type products. In the third quarter, it shipped around 3 GW of n-type modules, up 160% from the preceding quarter.
“Based on our business strategy and market demand, we have adjusted the pace of capacity expansion for wafers, cells and modules and expect our annual production capacity for monowafers, solar cells and solar modules to reach 65 GW, 55 GW and 70 GW, respectively, by the end of 2022,” said Li.
The company said it expects to sell between 13 GW and 15 GW of PV modules in the fourth quarter.
