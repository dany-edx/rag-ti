It is also considering hydrogen combustion in a gas turbine and a hybrid-electric architecture, with a hydrogen gas turbine coupled with fuel cells. It said it will decide on which technologies it favors by 2027 or 2028, when it plans to start developing the architecture of its zero-emission aircraft. “The A380 MSN1 flight test aircraft for new hydrogen technologies is currently being modified to carry liquid hydrogen tanks and their associated distribution systems,” said Airbus, noting that it is focusing on proton exchange membrane (PEM) tech.
Honda has announced plans to produce an all-new hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) based on the recently launched Honda CR-V, starting in 2024. The Japanese manufacturer will make the cars in Marysville, Ohio. “The new CR-V-based FCEV also will mark North America's first production vehicle to combine a plug-in feature with FCEV technology in one model, which enables the driver to charge the onboard battery to deliver EV driving around town with the flexibility of fast hydrogen refueling for longer trips,” it said, noting that it will provide more details about the FCEV version of the CR-V closer to its introduction in 2024. 
Hydrogen Vehicle Systems (HVS) has announced a GBP 15 million ($17.8 million) grant from the UK government's Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC), as part of a broader funding package to support hydrogen fuel-cell heavy goods vehicles (HGV). “The project, which will run between 1st September 2022, and 30th June 2025, comprises a consortium led by HVS and includes Grayson (Thermal Systems), Fusion Processing (vehicle vision systems), and PNDC (a commercial arm of Strathclyde University specialising in power electronics),” said Glasgow-based HVS.
Cepsa has revealed that it will invest in the construction of two green hydrogen production plants at its energy parks in Campo de Gibraltar (Cádiz) and Palos de la Frontera (Huelva), Spain. It said it will also invest in solar and wind projects to power the industrial complexes. “The Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley is a groundbreaking project whose 2 GW capacity is 10 times bigger than the largest under construction in Europe today,” said Cepsa CEO Maarten Wetselaar.
Renewable and low-emission hydrogen development in Northwest Europe should “gradually scale up in the short- to medium-term” to reach a production capacity target of over 30 GW by 2030
The International Energy Agency said in a new report that renewable and low-emission hydrogen development in northwestern Europe will “gradually scale up in the short- to medium-term.” It said it expects production capacity to surpass 30 GW by 2030.

They have found that PV glazing technologies can be easily integrated into existing double- or triple-glazed substandard windows to significantly reduce building energy use and carbon emissions.
The team created glaze units using three types of PV window technology: a non-wavelength-selective technology using perovskite-based thin-film; a wavelength-selective technology, or so-called transparent PV; and dynamic PV technology, which is a recent innovation combing dynamic glazing technology with PV conversion.
They reportedly translated the nanoscopic glazing unit simulations to large-scale building energy simulations using the EnergyPlus and OpenStudio physics-based building energy simulation tools. They used weather data inputs from the Typical Meteorological Year database to simulate the energy consumption profiles of buildings in terms of heating, cooling, and lighting in 15-minute intervals over the course of a year.
The results showed that “PV glazing with a power conversion efficiency as low as 6% reduces energy use by more than 30%,” according to the researchers. They said increases in efficiency translate into additional energy use reduction. At efficiencies of 12.5%, perovskite thin-film and transparent PV technologies reach 42% energy-use reduction when integrated into double- or triple-glazed windows.
Dynamic PV glazing reaches almost 50% energy savings and “has the highest potential savings amongst PV technologies,” according to the researchers. However, they noted that the technology has only achieved an efficiency of 11% in a lab setting, so it needs further development to reach its full potential.
The results also showed that dynamic PV glazing generates more electricity in hotter months, with more than 1,200 gigajoules (GJ) of generation in June and September, but less than 200 GJ from December to January.
“In contrast, static wavelength-selective PV consistently generates more than 500 GJ each month but never exceeds 1,000 GJ for any single month,” said the researchers, who shared their findings in “Photovoltaic windows cut energy use and CO2 emissions by 40% in highly glazed buildings,” which was recently published in One Earth.

India installed 1.9 GW of open-access solar (PV backed by private contracts) from January to September, marking a 96% increase from the 956 MW installed in the same period in 2021, according to a new report by Mercom India.
The nation surpassed 7 GW of cumulative, “open-access” solar capacity in December 2021. Karnataka leads with almost 38% (around 2.7 GW of the total) of the country’s cumulative 7 GW open-access solar capacity capacity. Maharashtra has installed the second highest amount of open-access solar capacity at 801 MW (around 11% of the total).
The report noted high electricity tariffs, timely approvals by distribution companies (discoms), and a favorable regulatory framework as the main drivers for open-access solar expansion in Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu.
The nation added 596 MW of open-access solar capacity in the third quarter of 2022, from 312 MW installed in the third quarter of 2021. As of Sept. 30, more than 5 GW of open-access PV projects were in the pipeline (under development and pre-construction phase).
“The demand by corporates for solar under the open access route has been phenomenal. The growth would have been steeper if not for the supply constraints and price increase. The pipeline of projects to be commissioned is impressive and bigger than ever,” said Priya Sanjay, managing director of Mercom India. “While the demand has mostly been from large corporates, there is a huge untapped market of SMEs and MSMEs due to lack of awareness.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/02/romania-provides-funding-for-ci-battery-storage-systems/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,EASTERN EUROPE,ROMANIA",MARIJA MAISCH,"DECEMBER 2, 2022",Romania provides funding for C&I battery storage systems,"The government of Romania is looking to support the deployment of commercial and industrial (C&I) battery energy storage systems (BESS) to the tune of EUR 103.5 million. Minister of Energy Virgil Popescu said in a Facebook post that projects can be submitted until Dec. 28.
The grants will be allocated for the purchase of system components and equipment for the construction of new battery projects, as well as the construction of the BESS facilities. Eligible applicants include micro-, small- or medium-sized enterprises (including startups), and large enterprises.
The government has secured a total of EUR 103.48 million, of which EUR 79.6 million is from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), with the remaining amount coming from state funds. Romania’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan consists of EUR 14.24 billion in grants and EUR 14.94 billion in loans. About 41% of the plan will be directed to the green energy transition.
Under the new scheme, the grants will come in the form of reimbursement of expenses. According to Popescu, the maximum amount of BESS grants shall not exceed EUR 167,000 per megawatt-hour installed and EUR 15 million per project. A single applicant may submit only one project. All projects must be implemented by the end of 2025. The subsidy scheme will contribute to Romania’s energy transition objectives by developing at least 240 MW/480 MWh.
At this point, Romania’s installed BESS capacity is negligible. The largest system now under construction is a 7 MW lithium-ion battery owned by Megalodan Storage in Ilfov county, near Bucharest. Presently, the only operational projects in the country are two BESS systems operated by Portugal's EDPR, with a total capacity of around 1.5 MWh.
However, Romania has big battery manufacturing ambitions and plans to have a 2 GW battery industry by the end of 2025. The country also plans to train some 20,000 people over the next four years to overcome the existing skill gap in the battery sector.
“We want to attract investments of at least EUR 2 billion in the battery sector in the next five years,” Prime Minister Nicolae Ciucă said in June, after signing a memorandum of understanding with EIT InnoEnergy for the development of the battery sector.
In a separate announcement this week, the government said it has adopted an emergency ordinance that gives prosumers the possibility to install PV panels at both the place of electricity consumption and at other locations, as long as the systems are installed within a single distribution network. According to Popescu, the move was made in response to requests to the Ministry of Energy and parliament from a number of prosumers.

“The system consists of multiple individual floaters moored to a shared mooring grid,” the company says on its website, noting that the floaters are made of flexible, air-filled double-wall fabric. “Under low overpressure, this double wall fabric combines excellent local floater stability and with such a low global stiffness that the floater can easily follow the wave profile.”
The company was awarded the demonstration project by the Dutch government’s Renewable Energy Transition (HER+) fund. The concept was first demonstrated in a small-scale pilot project on Oostvoornse Meer, a lake near Rotterdam.
The proof-of-concept project consisted of two floaters measuring 7 meters by 13 meters, topped with 20 kW solar panels. The flexible thin-film PV modules were developed by a consortium led by TNO, a Dutch research institute.
The flexible floating solar technology reportedly offers less wave resistance, facilitating the use of lighter floaters and anchoring. The lighter materials are potentially cheaper than the materials used for rigid floats.
“Due to the expense of material used for heavy, rigid floats, it is often difficult to make these systems economically viable,” said TNO researcher Wim Soppe. “This new concept requires a lot less material and we therefore have high hopes that it will turn out to be a lot cheaper.”
If the offshore pilot project is successful, the team plans to build a commercial system ranging in size from 1 MW to 5 MW at a wind farm in the North Sea by 2024.

In January 2022, Australian fossil fuels giant Woodside Energy revealed plans to build a 500 MW solar facility and 400 MWh battery energy storage system near Karratha, in Western Australia’s northwest, to help power its Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility. Now an agreement with the Ngarluma Aboriginal Corporation (NAC) secures the land on which to build the first 50 MW solar project and associated battery system.
Woodside said it has entered into a bilateral Indigenous Land Use Agreement and an agreement with the NAC. The agreement relates to lands being investigated for the proposed Woodside Power Project to be built at Maitland, about 15 kilometers southwest of Karratha.
The initial project comprises a 50 MW solar energy plant complemented by a battery energy storage system but Woodside said there is potential to expand the power opportunity to a maximum of 500 MW if customer demand warrants it.
The project will supply renewable energy to industrial customers in the region, including its own Pluto LNG export facility. All transmission of power from the solar facility is to be delivered via the Horizon Power-operated section of the North West Interconnected System to its customers.
Woodside said it has progressed environmental studies for the project and submitted a referral to the Environmental Protection Authority in Nov. 2021. The company said it is continuing to work with preferred developers, Pacific Energy Group and Horizon Power, on development of the solar, battery energy storage system and transmission infrastructure required for the project.
Woodside Chief Executive Meg O’Neill said the agreement with the NAC will allow the project to progress.
“We have been engaging with NAC regarding the power opportunity since 2019 and the agreements are a significant milestone to celebrate together,” she said. “We look forward to continuing to work with NAC and Ngarluma people as we progress the power opportunity.”
The agreements set out a framework for the delivery of social and economic benefits to NAC and Ngarluma people in connection with the power opportunity, and outline how Woodside and NAC will work together to develop the power opportunity, including the management of cultural heritage.
The deal comes on the back of Woodside's successful proposal to deliver a 600 MW green hydrogen megaproject in New Zealand.
Woodside is certainly not alone when it comes to solar uptake in the Pilbara. Rio Tinto recently announced plans to invest AUD 600 million ($402 million) in the construction of two new solar farms and battery energy storage systems as part of its efforts to decarbonize operations in the Pilbara.

France's Ministry of Ecological Transition has reported that around 1,715 MW of new PV systems were connected to the French grid in the January-September period, from 2,201 MW in the first nine months of 2021.
Installations above 250 kW in size accounted for about 52% of the new solar capacity. Installations below 9 kW in size represented 89% of the newly connected units and 13% of all new capacity.
France reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 15.8 GW at the end of September, with 15.5 GW of the total on the French mainland. The aggregate capacity of queued solar projects with grid-connection requests, meanwhile, has increased by 40% since the start of the year to 16.1 GW, including 3.4 GW with signed connection agreements.
In the first three quarters of the year, solar production stood at 16.7 TWh, from 12.3 TWh during the same period in 2021. Solar generation accounts for 4.7% of French electricity consumption.
The regions of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, and Grand Est have accounted for 70% of the newly connected power so far this year. They are the regions with the highest installed capacities, representing 73% of all cumulative power connected in France by the end of September.

US Customs and Border Protection has released a significant shipment of solar panels for sale in the US market, after initially holding them under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), according to a recently published industry note from Philip Shen, the managing director of ROTH Capital Partners.
Shen said the authorities released JinkoSolar modules made with Wacker polysilicon.
“We believe this could result in a ramp up of volume and imports,” wrote Shen.
The UFLPA places the burden of proof on buyers to show that goods imported from China's Xinjiang region do not have any connection to forced labor. To be in compliance, companies must provide a comprehensive supply chain map, complete lists of all workers at their facilities, and proof that workers were not subjected to forced labor conditions.
In November, Reuters reported that more than 1,000 shipments of solar energy components, valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars, had been blocked in US ports under the UFLPA. ROTH Capital said in August that as much as 3 GW had been held by US Customs since the law was enacted. As much as 9 GW to 12 GW of solar modules could be prevented from entering US markets by the end of the year, added Shen.
ROTH Capital said the release of the panels will have a positive impact on the US utility-scale solar sector. It warned that US Customs may now start focusing beyond the top solar component importers.
“We could end up being in a two steps forward, one step back situation,” said the company.

“Based on average 2021 equipment prices and [projected] fuel prices … a new heat pump to heat an average home in a cold climate is cheaper than a natural gas condensing boiler in most of the main heating markets, often even without subsidy,” said the report.
The United States, Canada, Japan, Italy and China are among the countries in which unsubsidized heat pumps are already cost-competitive with gas boilers, according to the IEA. However, in markets such as the United Kingdom and Germany, subsidies are still required to make them cost-competitive.
“Even where the cost of a heat pump over its lifetime is already the cheapest heating option, financial incentives, including grants and low‐interest loans, may still be needed to reduce the initial cost burden, which may deter the building owner from installing a heat pump in the first place,” the report said.
The IEA found that financial incentives for heat pumps are already available in more than 30 countries, which together account for more than 70% of current heating demand. The agency said it expects heat pump sales to reach new highs by 2030, after growing by nearly 15% in 2021. Last year, heat pump sales rose by around 35% in the European Union, followed by North America at around 15%, Japan and South Korea at around 13% each, and China at around 12%.
However, heat pumps accounted for just 10% of buildings’ global heating needs in 2021, according to the report. The current total installed capacity of heat pumps in residential and non-residential buildings is more than 1,000 GW, with nearly half of that capacity installed in North America. Europe has the second highest installed capacity, followed by Japan, South Korea, and China. The rest of the world combined has less installed capacity than any of these countries.
“Many units are used in mild-to-warm climates, where they are used primarily for cooling yet still represent the primary heating source (for a few months of the year),” the report said. “However, the penetration of heat pumps today is highest in the coldest parts of Europe, meeting 60% of total buildings heating needs in Norway and over 40% in Sweden and Finland thanks to long-standing policy support.”
Heat pump sales in Europe could rise from 2 million in 2021 to 7 million by 2030 if governments succeed in hitting their emission-reduction targets and energy security goals, said the IEA. The region is expected to reach almost 500 GW of heat pump capacity in buildings by 2030. The agency forecasts China’s installed capacity to see the strongest growth between 2021 and 2030, overtaking Europe as the second largest heat pump market by 2030. North America is expected to remain the market leader until then.
