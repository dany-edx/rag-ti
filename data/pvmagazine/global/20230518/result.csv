The Spanish cabinet has approved a €2.19 billion ($2.38 billion) investment plan. The strategy was originally proposed by the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to combat drought and enhance water resources.
The measures include constructing desalination plants powered by solar plants, supporting urban water reuse, reducing fees for affected agricultural farms, and alleviating pressure on aquifers supplying the Doñana National Park.
The government authorized the state-owned company Acuamed to initiate tenders for new desalination plants coupled with photovoltaic solar parks, allocating a budget of €600 million. Acuamed will establish agreements to incentivize investment in photovoltaic parks and set a maximum sale price for desalinated water.
Spanish developers have already implemented projects utilizing photovoltaics to address water scarcity through desalination plants.
Scientists from the University of León and La Laguna have created a model, applied in the Canary Islands, that calculates parameters for a hybrid wind and solar photovoltaic power plant supporting a desalination facility capable of supplying a population until the plant's end of life.
In Andalusia, the Agua+S circular economy project aims to obtain desalinated water from the sea using renewable energy generated by floating photovoltaic plants in reservoirs.
Spanish companies such as Abengoa and Ayesa have constructed the world's largest reverse osmosis desalination plant in Saudi Arabia, operational since last December, serving the water needs of approximately 3,000,000 people.
In Chile, Acciona, a Spanish company, supplies renewable electricity to a desalination plant in the Atacama region, catering to the human consumption of four municipalities.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/18/solar-panels-for-ski-areas/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FRANCE",GWÉNAËLLE DEBOUTTE,"MAY 18, 2023",Solar panels for ski areas,"From pv magazine France
France-based off-grid solutions provider Sunwind has developed a PV module that can be used at ski stations, ski lifts and resorts at high altitudes in mountainous areas.
“The mountain is in our DNA,”§ the company's founder, Xavier Duport, told pv magazine France. “The high mountain environment is conducive to the production of solar electricity, due to greater irradiation, less atmospheric pollution, and a stronger albedo effect which brings 5 to 10% of production in more about the winter months thanks to the snowpack.”
For the modules, the company uses a special encapsulation process based on a composite multi-layer that gives them the exact shape of the polycarbonate side windows they replace.
“It all started with the Serre-Chevalier ski resort, in the Hautes-Alpes region, where we solarized a ski lift station for the first time, by replacing the polycarbonate canopies with our semi-rigid photovoltaic panels called eV+, which are five times lighter than a framed glass module,” Duport said.
The 20%-efficient panels measure 1,020 mm x 2,000 mm and utilize PERC solar cells. The products can be used in PV systems with a power range from 7 kW to 12 kW depending on the surface size.
“With a dozen ski areas equipped in France with eV+ panels, we have opened up a new market with ski lift manufacturers,” he said. “We are partners of the Italian Leitner and the French group Poma, which is now taking us internationally. Poma offers the installation of eV+ solar panels as standard in its catalog of ski lift stations, as well as when retrofitting existing stations. The cabins are small off-grid networks, equipped with eV+ panels and a battery.”
Sunwind currently encapsulates the panels at a production line operated by Italian subcontractor Solbian, but it hopes to set up soon its own production equipment.
“We have started a research program with CEA Liten and the Rhône-Alpes region in order to develop our own encapsulation line, which could initially reach 40 MW to 50 MW per year,” said Duport. “We want to offer a 100% European, or even 100% French product within two years.
Sunwind does not want to limit itself to ski resorts and aims to offer its eV+ panels to the building world.
“We also plan to exploit a market that is still little exploited, that of the facades of industrial buildings and that of photovoltaic noise barriers,” said Duport.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/18/new-model-to-assess-levelized-cost-of-hydrogen-in-pv-powered-electrolysis/,"HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SINGAPORE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 18, 2023",New model to assess levelized cost of hydrogen in PV-powered electrolysis,"Researchers at the National University of Singapore have developed an optimization model for PV-powered green hydrogen facilities that can evaluate different options for each technology.
The scientists said in “Green hydrogen from solar power for decarbonization: What will it cost?,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion Management, that their model incorporates solar irradiance, physical hydrogen storage, land footprint, power grid carbon intensity, and various factors including project type, size, capital and operating costs, efficiencies, and lifespans. They also said that in the current technology landscape, an LCOH of less than $10/kg will be needed to make green hydrogen compete with gray, blue, and orange hydrogen.
“The model accounts for the impact of intra-day and inter-day variations in renewable electricity generation by considering the solar irradiance data at a fine granularity,” they said, noting that it also allows for an import from and export to the local electrical grid. “The model enables an option to install batteries for storing and utilizing renewable electrons. Similarly, it also considers the storage of hydrogen molecules to manage hydrogen demand.”
The model considers a green hydrogen facility with a PV plant, electrolyzer, battery storage, buffer tanks, and a pumping station for hydrogen supply, and incorporates the facility's ability to trade power with the grid as necessary.
“The main challenge in designing this facility is to use the transient and uncertain solar irradiance optimally to satisfy hydrogen demand at the least expense,” the scientists emphasized. “The model is employed to obtain the optimal facility design that yields cheapest green hydrogen under different geographical and techno-economic conditions.”
The model works based on four different scenarios: a fully grid-disconnected plant or Islanded Facility (ILF) which generates exclusively green hydrogen; a plant that can buy electricity from the grid with no option for selling it back or Facility with Grid Import (FGI); a facility that can sell electricity to the grid with no option of buying it or Facility with Grid Export (FGE); and a plant that can either import electricity from or export electricity to the local power grid or Facility with Grid Import and Export (FGIE).
For the first plant, the research team found that its LCOH might be $10.68/kg in Saudi Arabia, $12.0/kg in Australia, $13.86/kg in Singapore, and $42.12/kg in Germany, with the difference between these three countries being attributable mainly to the solar radiation levels and the costs being estimated by assuming the cost of water to be zero. “The stronger the solar irradiance, the lower the LCOH and smaller the solar PV farm,” the academics said.
For Singapore only, the researchers also identified the LCOH of the other project typologies and found it is $11.78/kg, $12.55/kg, and $10.44/kg for the FGI, FGE, and FGIE projects, respectively.
“Clearly, grid connectivity in any configuration lowers LCOH compared to ILF,” they explained. ” Clearly, grid connectivity in any configuration lowers LCOH compared to ILF the he focus should be on advances in solar PV, storage, and battery technologies.”
According to their analysis, an LCOH of $3.29/kg to $4.15/kg could be through a 60% reduction in solar PV Capex, a 20% increase in electrolyzer performance, a 75% reduction in battery Capex, and a discount factor of 0.01%. “Indeed, green hydrogen seems like a potential yet costly silver bullet for deep decarbonization at this time,” they concluded.

New statistics from grid operator Enedis reveal that collective self consumption operations are rapidly developing in France. Enedis says that their number increased from only six in 2018 to at the end of March 2023 – a figure that has doubled in the last 12 months.
More than 2,200 consumers and more than 300 producers are now integrated into local electricity production representing a total power of 11 MW, largely of photovoltaic origin. The local authorities account for more than 100 of these communities.
Enedis provided the new numbers when French Minister for the Energy Transition Agnès Pannier-Runacher participated in the commissioning ceremony of the Partag'élec self consumption operations in Surzur, a commune in the Morbihan department of Brittany, in northwestern France.
“I welcome the deployment of collective self consumption operations, which was made possible thanks to our support measures,” she stated. “This is an excellent lever for achieving our climate objectives while allowing consumers to have access to competitive electricity.”
The Partag’élec community, in operation since November, is one of 22 collective self consumption operations in Brittany, which is one of the most dynamic regions in this booming field. Led by Morbihan Energies, this community is connected to the public electricity distribution network managed by Enedis and is based on the Linky meter counting system, which certifies flows between producers and consumers.
The Partag’élec operation brings together 130 consumers, including 18 buildings in the municipality of Surzur, 107 individuals and 5 professionals. Together, they share electricity from a solar power plant made up of 680 photovoltaic panels with an electricity production capacity of 249 kW.

The scientists aim to replace commonly used hole transport materials like PEDOT:PSS and copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) with AgSCN.
“CuSCN's advantages lie in the fact that it can serve as both a hole transport layer and a source of Cu doping, while AgSCN, with its greater resistivity, may serve just as a source of Ag doping with a slower diffusion rate,” the scientists explained, noting that AsSCN is also better at transferring charges between HTL and perovskite layer compared to PEDOT:PSS.
The group built the cell with an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on AgSCN, an absorber based on a type of lead-halide perovskite known as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), a phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer, a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
The academics deposited the AgSCN thin film in a dry glove box with relative humidity between 25% and 30% at least 30 minutes before the deposition of the perovskite layer started. They then deposited the perovskite layer on the active layer on the HTL via spin coating at 4,000 rpm for 30 seconds. The performance of the solar cell was compared to a reference device constructed with an HTM relying on PEDOT:PSS.
The AgSCN-based device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 16.66%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.14 mV, a short-circuit current of 19.0 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 77.1%. The PEDOT:PSS cell reached an efficiency of 15.11%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.04 V, a short-circuit current of 18.17 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 80.37%.
“The successfully achieved thin film of AgSCN made a better perovskite film with free pinholes and large grains, while the thin film of PEDOT:PSS made a similar quality perovskite film with pinholes discovered,” the group explained, noting that the AgSCN cell was also able to retain 80.9% of its initial efficiency after 500 hours in an atmosphere with 48% relative humidity.
“This low-temperature, low-cost AgSCN production method is seen as easy and scalable, which bodes well for commercializing perovskite-based flexible devices and photovoltaic technologies,” the researchers concluded. “In sum, AgSCN is a non-toxic, inexpensive rival that is simple to work with at low temperatures. It is a strong contender for creating tandem devices and high-efficiency p-i-n junction solar cells made of perovskites.”
They described the cell tech in “AgSCN as a new hole transporting material for inverted perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports.

The conference started with three inaugural speeches discussing the evolving PV manufacturing landscape in Europe and the United States.
Žygimantas Vaičiūnas, policy director for the European Solar Manufacturing Council, highlighted the practical challenge of accessing finance for EU member states, despite the substantial financial support possibilities unlocked by REPowerEU, the Net-zero Industry Act, and the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF). Spain has been allocated 12.93% of the RePower EU funding, equivalent to €2.59 billion ($2.8 billion), which could realistically enable the establishment of 10 GW to 15 GW of PV manufacturing capacity in the country, contributing to around one-third to half of the EU's 30 GW target by 2030, as explained by Vaičiūnas.
Javier Sanz, a spokesperson for the European Solar Photovoltaic Industry Alliance, emphasized the importance of a product-focused manufacturing competitiveness strategy in Europe. Sanz posed the following question: “What kind of product do we want to sell in Europe?” He also called for stricter carbon footprint requirements and a level playing field. He noted the need for domestic solar and storage manufacturing to compete with China, India, and the United States beyond just price. Sanz also suggested that opex support and subsidized module sales could help balance the price equation.
Eckhart Gouras, the managing director of pv magazine, contributed with a perspective on the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which he called a “big American sandwich.” Gouras presented a powerful illustration of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) in the solar industry, with the top slice of bread indicating upstream support of $0.07/W for “Made in USA” solar modules, and the bottom slice representing downstream support of up to 50% in investment tax credit. Gouras noted the unparalleled industrial policy of the ITC and called for a new globalized approach that enables international players to build localized markets and benefit from its advantages.
The “Going global” session featured representatives from PV Hardware (PVH), Power Electronics, the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA), and Atlas Renewable Energy. It highlighted a new era of globalization in the solar and storage industries. Alvaro Casado from PVH discussed the company's decision to open a 6 GW tracker factory in the United States, which predates the announcement of the ITC, and emphasized the motivation behind it: bypassing transportation logistics and providing local support to clients.
Iván Higueras Rivas, CEO of PVH, and David Salvo, CEO of Power Electronics, expressed concerns about Europe's insufficient efforts to encourage domestic manufacturing over the United States. Brad Heavner, from CALSSA, showcased the growth of US manufacturing in batteries and polysilicon. While the United States has experienced a polysilicon revival, both regions still lack the production capacity to meet demand. María del Puy Ayerra, director of development in Spain for Atlas Renewable Energy, noted the need for companies to adapt to cultural differences and approach international expansion with humility, given the challenges in Europe's factory scale and project acceptance.
The session on permitting in Spain featured a fireside chat between Maria Assumpta Farran i Poca from Generalitat Catalunya, and Lucas Monsalve and Inés Monroy from Mediacion Verde. Farran highlighted the limited space in Catalonia and the reluctance of developers to proceed with approved projects. Mediacion Verde emphasized the need for improved communication with local communities to demonstrate the value of renewable energy projects. The session also explored the idea of industrialized areas paying a premium to regions exporting solar and wind electricity.
Benito Montiel from Grupo Cobra, Luis Selva from BNZ, María del Puy Ayerra from Atlas Renewable Energy, and Paula Alonso González from Soto Solar participated in the permitting session, addressing the lack of coordination among different entities in the permitting process, resulting in errors and delays. They also discussed the challenges of meeting project deadlines due to the Spanish Government's Royal Decree-Law. Regarding the large number of recently approved projects, estimated at over 100 GW, panelists predicted that only about half of them would actually be constructed.
In the storage-focused session, Rosalía Rivas Saiz from Red Eléctrica delivered a keynote speech, providing an account of the current cannibalization scenario in Spain, discussing storage access and hybridization projections by April 2023, and explaining the expected surplus of PV and wind production compared to consumption by 2030. Rivas also presented details about the planned grid deployment, its connection to curtailment, and shared other data that attendees were eager to capture in photos.
Luis Marquina, the president of Spain’s storage association AEPIBAL, moderated the session. It involved Javier Revuelta from AFRY, Juan Fraga from Engytek, Eugenio Domínguez from HESSTEC, Iker Labiano from Sungrow EMEA, and Alejandro Pintado from Growatt New Energy.
The panelists concurred that the regulation of the storage industry is moving in the right direction but at a sluggish pace, emphasizing the need for accelerated government action to harmonize electricity market prices. They also proposed that Spain could enter the storage market using alternative technologies apart from lithium. Revuelta's presentation outlined the concept of ‘socio-economic welfare' (SEW) associated with storage and advocated for collaboration among Europe, China, and the United States in technology development.
The final session of the first day centered on self-consumption and commenced with an expert interview featuring Sergio Layunta from Salicru, a well-established Spanish brand with 57 years of experience in the market and its own technical service. Layunta revealed that Salicru is on the verge of introducing a new hybrid inverter designed for commercial and industrial self-consumption, foreseeing a widespread demand for batteries in this segment in the near future.
The self-consumption panel included José Carlos Díaz Lacaci from Powen, Íñigo Amoribieta from Otovo, Javier Revuelta from AFRY, Jorge Mallén López from Lantania, Carlos López from Aldea Energy, and Vanesa Peñalver from Sunova Solar. They deliberated on the decline in self-consumption during the first four months of 2023, known as the “solar winter,” in contrast to the remarkable growth experienced in 2022. Factors contributing to this decline included the decrease in electricity prices, which diminished demand urgency, and delays in aid allocation. The panelists highlighted the challenges faced in implementing shared self-consumption and solar communities, expressing criticism towards the Government's draft regulation proposal. Some speakers mentioned passing on the 10% to 15% electricity price reduction to clients, while others emphasized offering additional services in exchange.
The second day began with a panel on local manufacturing featuring a keynote speech by Javier Sanz from the European Alliance of the Solar Photovoltaic Industry (ESIA). Sanz emphasized that substantial funding, amounting to millions of euros, remains unallocated due to companies not applying for it. The panel addressed the obstacles associated with reintroducing polysilicon, ingot, and wafer manufacturing to Europe, while also showcasing success stories of companies that received European support, including Abora Solar.
The keynote speech was followed by an interview with Kyle Xu from Das Solar, focusing on the company's expansion plans in Europe and their commitment to becoming a local player. Xu amusingly remarked that although transitioning from establishing module assembly lines to building a complete supply chain in Europe would take time, Spain's delightful cuisine serves as an effective catalyst.
José María Vega de Seoane from Tecnalia, Xabier Otaño from Mondragon Assembly, and Alejandro del Amo from Abora Solar shared three successful manufacturing stories in Europe, highlighting differences in support packages between the US and Europe in terms of size and speed of delivery. The panelists discussed the potential of subsidizing the sale of European-manufactured products and the competitiveness of niche products in Europe. They also welcomed the entry of large companies like Iberdrola into manufacturing, anticipating the growth of secondary industries and the opportunity for these companies to showcase their own products.
The conference concluded with a revamping and repowering session featuring Fermín Lagunas Llorente from BayWa r.e., Asier Ukar from PI Berlin, Víctor Hernández from Ingeteam, and Pubash Yazdani from Escelco. Spain, with its generous incentive program, has become a great testing ground for revamping projects, having installed over 4 GW between 2008 and 2009, surpassing any other country. However, replacing failing components poses challenges. The panel discussed various questions, including the view of banks on financing revamping projects and whether it presents a good business opportunity for O&M companies. Ultimately, after evaluating technical, financial, and legal obstacles, the panelists concluded that revamping is a worthwhile endeavor.
We would like to thank all the speakers, sponsors, and organizers of Solar + Storage España for a terrific conference.

In November 2022, Qcells and a group of European research institutes in Thalheim, Germany, started a four-year research project to manufacture highly efficient tandem solar cells and modules.
The group established a pilot manufacturing line in Thalheim through the so-called “Pepperoni” (Pilot line for European Production of PEROvskite-Silicon taNdem modules on Industrial scale) project.
The company's parent, Hanwha Solutions, has also announced plans to invest $100 million in the deployment of a pilot production line for perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells at its factory in Jincheon, South Korea, by the end of 2024.
“This investment in Jincheon will mark an important step in securing technological leadership,” stated Qcells CEO Justin Lee. “With global R&D network spanning from Korea, Germany and the US, Qcells will ramp up its efforts to produce high-efficiency advanced tandem cells.”
Earlier this year, Germany's Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin and Qcells presented a tandem cell with up to 29.3% efficiency rate. The results have been certified by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
The latest issue of pv magazine celebrates China’s journey from solar new entrant to the installation of more than 100 GW(AC) of panels this year – Vincent Shaw and Frank Haugwitz consider a remarkable 20-year journey. We take a look at what Indonesia needs to achieve its net-zero ambition and also explore the stirrings of a solar renaissance in Europe, via buzzing trade shows and gigafatory planning.
The device is based on a silicon bottom cell relying on Hanwha Qcells' monocrystalline Q.antum half cell technology and a perovskite-based top cell.
“This latest record efficiency result, of 28.7%, is an improvement of almost one percentage point compared with the 2020 record value of 27.8%,” the module maker said in a statement. “This boost in tandem efficiency has been enabled by improvement of both the perovskite and the silicon subcells.”

Currently, the nation has limited operational small-scale solar parks and a 100 MW solar plant constructed by Engie in 2019 that supplies power to the Belgian grid.
Despite the challenging landscape for utility-scale solar in Belgium, EnergyVision has revealed plans to construct a 40 MW PV facility at Ostend-Bruges Airport in the Flemish Region. Construction of the project, valued at €35 million, will start in September. It will feature 66,200 solar modules with individual outputs of 605 W. The solar plant will supply power to the airport, with no specified completion date.
“However, with an annual electricity production of almost 37,000 MWh, the airport will generate much more electricity than it can consume itself,” EnergyVision said in a statement. “Therefore, part of the generated green power will be diverted to Antwerp Airport (Deurne), with the remainder going directly to local residents.”
The company said that it might expand the solar plant at a later stage, but it did not provide any additional details.
“Soon, Ostend citizens – families but also [small and medium-sized enterprises] – will be able to register and buy the generated electricity on a priority basis, at fixed prices, without any price increase, and for the long term,” said EnergyVision CEO Maarten Michielssens.
Michielssens added that the company is now setting up a platform to allow citizens to co-invest in the project, in the form of an eight-year loan with a fixed annual interest rate of 5%.
