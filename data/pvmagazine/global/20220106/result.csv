The partnership will study the use of liquid air storage CRYOBatteries, developed by U.K.-based Highview Power, in four and eight-hour storage configurations to determine an optimal solution for the institute’s Binhai Power Station Energy Storage Demo project, in the Binhai county of Jiangsu, China. Both systems will have a capacity of 50MW.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
Highview Power's technology has already been deployed at scale, starting with its 5MW/15MWh Pilsworth plant in the U.K., described as the world’s first grid-connected liquid air energy storage system. Highview has also launched other projects including the development of up to seven CRYOBatteries, ranging in scale from 50MW/300MWh upwards, across Spain, in a development announced last year.
The technology uses energy to compress and cool air to minus 196 degrees Celsius until it liquefies and around 700 liters of ambient air becomes one liter of liquid. Stored in insulated tanks at low pressure, the liquid air is then reheated, creating a high-pressure gas that is used to drive turbines and generate electricity. Waste cold and heat from the process is stored separately.
Last year, a British-Australian research team assessed the potential of liquid air energy storage for large scale application and found such systems could be built for €300-600/kWh and offer a 20-year return on investment. Those figures, the researchers found, could be significantly reduced by co-locating liquid air storage facilities with industrial consumers who would pay for excess heat generated by the process. Highview's projects were defined as bankable by the research team, although the academics stressed those positive business cases are favored by certain conditions, including a determined price structure in the energy market and the presence of a grid unable to support high levels of renewable energy penetration.
Highview’s CRYOBatteries have been touted as adaptable and able to provide services at all levels of the electricity system. They can reportedly support power generation by firming renewables and provide energy arbitrage and peak shaving, among other grid services. They can also provide grid stabilization services such as inertia, voltage support and reactive power, as well as acting as a source of backup power for end users, it has been claimed.
The technology was conceived for utility scale applications with outputs ranging from 5-100MW. Liquid air energy storage offers high energy density and ease of deployment, compared to incumbent storage tech. Versus pumped-hydro storage, which harnesses the power of water in a similar way, liquid air systems offer much greater flexibility as they do not have to be tied to bodies of water. Proponents of liquid air storage facilities say they can be developed from an already established industry and without expensive or rare materials plus, they suffer from no degradation issues and offer a lifespan exceeding 30 years.
However, the cycle efficiency of liquid air energy storage – for charging and discharging – is relatively low, at around 60%. That could be improved, however, through integration and co-location with other processes such as liquefied natural gas terminals, as suggested in the previously mentioned research.
In 2020, Sumitomo announced a $46 million investment in London-based Highview Power, in a vote of confidence for the novel storage technology. “It is the only long-duration energy storage solution available today that offers multiple gigawatt-hours of storage, is scalable with no size limitations or geographic constraints, and produces zero emissions,” Sumitomo SHI FW said at the time.
In its announcement this week, the Japanese-owned, Finland-headquartered Sumitomo business unit said the liquid air storage system planned in China would “shift energy, reduce curtailment, and maintain system flexibility to allow [the] integration and growth of renewable[s] generation.” In addition, it will provide services to improve and maintain grid stability. The project is seen as particularly important in regard to China's plan, announced last year, to deploy 30GW of grid scale energy storage capacity and aim for renewables to account for more than half of total installed generation capacity by 2025.
According to the Shanghai Power Equipment Research Institute, the liquid air energy storage demonstration study “is the cornerstone of China’s energy transition plan to be carbon neutral by 2060.” The institute – a subsidiary of China’s largest energy company, state-owned SPIC – has been designated as the development center for energy storage technologies to help China’s decarbonization effort. SPIC is one of China’s five national generation groups and boasts installed power generation capacity of 190GW, of which 74GW is solar and wind power, according to Sumitomo's announcement. The state power company is also described as the largest PV asset owner in the world.

Brazil has just surpassed the historic mark of 13GW of installed PV capacity.
At the end of August, the country's installed solar power generation capacity stood at 10GW, which means that over 3GW of new PV systems were grid-connected in the last three months alone.
According to the Brazilian solar energy association, Absolar, the solar power source has already brought to Brazil more than BRL66.3 billion ($11.6 billion) in new investments and generated almost 390,000 jobs, accumulated since 2012.
The CEO of Absolar, Rodrigo Sauaia, said the PV power source is helping the country diversify its electricity supply, reduce pressure on water resources, and reduce the risk of further increases in electricity bills. “Large solar plants generate electricity at prices up to ten times lower than fossil thermoelectric plants or electricity imported from neighboring countries today,” he stated. “Thanks to the versatility and flexibility of solar technology, it only takes one day of installation to transform a home or business into a small plant that generates clean, renewable and affordable electricity. For a large scale solar plant[s], however, it takes less than 18 months from the issuance of the first approvals to the start of electricity generation. Thus, solar is recognized as champion in the speed of new-generation plants,” added Sauaia.
Brazil has 4.6GW of installed power capacity in large scale solar plants, equivalent to 2.4% of the country's electricity matrix. Since 2012, large solar power plants have brought to Brazil more than BRL23.9 billion in new investments and more than 138,000 jobs. Currently, large scale solar power plants are the sixth-largest source of generation in Brazil, with projects in operation in nine Brazilian states in the northeast (Bahia, Ceará, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Piauí and Rio Grande do Norte), southeast (Minas Gerais and São Paulo) and midwest (Tocantins).
In the distributed generation segment – which in Brazil includes all PV systems not exceeding 5MW in size, and operating under net metering – there is 8.4GW of installed capacity from the solar power source. This equates to more than BRL42.4 billion in investments and more than 251,000 jobs since 2012.
When adding the installed capacities of large plants and the generation of solar energy itself, the solar power source now occupies fifth place in the Brazilian electricity mix. The solar power source has already surpassed the installed power of thermoelectric plants powered by oil and other fossil fuels, which represent 9.1GW of the Brazilian mix.
For the chairman of the board of directors of Absolar, Ronaldo Koloszuk, in addition to being competitive and affordable, solar energy is quick to install and helps reduce electricity costs by up to 90%. “Competitive and clean electricity is essential for the country to recover its economy and be able to grow. The solar [power] source is part of this solution and a real engine for generating opportunities and new jobs,” concluded Koloszuk.

German automotive supplier Schaeffler is currently working with partners from the Netherlands to extract hydrogen from seawater in a pilot project. With demand for car components expected to decrease as a result of the transition to electromobility, the supplier is planning to expand its activities in the field of hydrogen which, according to Schaeffler, should also be supplied to the automotive industry.
The idea of producing green hydrogen at sea, from large amounts of offshore wind energy is widespread. However, this type of hydrogen production faces the major challenge electrolyzers require ultrapure water. That means seawater must first be desalinated and then painstakingly cleaned and filtered before it can flow to the sensitive membranes, and is a process that is driving up the cost of green hydrogen.
Schaeffler has set up start-up Hydron B.V. in the Netherlands to develop polymer electrolysis membrane (PEM) systems. To clean seawater before it reaches the membranes, the engineers have implemented a solution in which waste heat from the electrolysis process can be used to distill the salt water. The consortium says it has proven the functionality of its membrane distillation technology and the system was able to generate a kilogram of hydrogen per hour, with the membrane distillation making 10kg of ultra-pure water (UPW) available for electrolysis.
“The generation of green hydrogen from wind energy is an important growth area for Schaeffler,” said Bernd Hetterscheidt, head of the hydrogen strategic business area for the company. “In cooperation with our partners in the wind power industry, we want to become one of the leading providers of system components in this area. To do this, we combine the innovative technology of Hydron with the strengths of Schaeffler, such as our system understanding and our knowhow in the rapid scaling of products and projects in order to bring them onto the market as quickly as possible.”
Looking forward, Schaeffler wants to push ahead with scaling of the filters and desalination components for use on an industrial scale. In addition, the cost and resistance of the system will have to be improved. The aim is to reduce green hydrogen production costs from the current €4-10/kg to €2. Water treatment is of key importance to reduce the price of electrolysis and significant efficiency advantages could easily be converted into cost savings. Companies from the chemical industry, such as Canada's HPQ Silicon Resources, and rail sector businesses including Alstom have also formed consortia in a bid to be part of the race for cheap green hydrogen from seawater and wind energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/06/lowering-solar-module-temperatures-with-radiative-cooling-heat-pipes/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 6, 2022","Lowering solar module temperatures with radiative cooling, heat pipes","Researchers from Zhejiang University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China have developed a hybrid solar module cooling technique based on radiative cooling (RC) and the use of heat pipes to transfer heat.
“Many studies had investigated radiative cooling of photovoltaics by replacing the usual glass cover with highly emissive RC coatings on top of the solar cells,” researcher Salman Ahmed told pv magazine. “However, it was observed that this replacement only reduced the cell temperature by around 1 C to 2 C.”
He claimed that this minimal temperature reduction depends on the usual 3.2 mm glass cover used for solar cell encapsulation, which features about 70% silica and gives it a relatively higher built-in thermal emissivity. As a result, even if the glass covers are replaced with ideally emissive radiative coolers on top, the reduction in solar cell temperature is not considerable.
“Therefore, spectrally modifying the existing PV module covers or substituting them with novel RC materials is inefficient for passive PV cooling,” Ahmed explained.
He said that three main requirements should be fulfilled to improve the cooling effect. The radiative coolers should not replace the existing PV glass covers, so the natural RC ability of glass can be harnessed to add to the overall cooling gain. There should also be an efficient and quick heat transfer mechanism between the PV module, which is also the heat source, and the RC heat sink. In addition, the RC module should directly face the sky to radiate maximum waste heat into outer space.
The proposed system consists of a PV module and a separate RC module, integrated with a flat plate heat pipe in between. A separate RC module is used along with the existing glass cover on the solar cells and the heat pipe is integrated between the PV and RC modules, providing quick heat transfer. The RC module is then placed on the condensing section of the heat pipe facing the sky.
“The PV module is placed on the evaporating section and waste heat from the cells is radiated out simultaneously from both the RC module and the usual glass cover,” Ahmed said. “As a result, a significant reduction in solar cell operating temperature and a rise in electrical efficiency are obtained.”

The performance of the system was tested through a thermal model and numerical simulations by varying the external and internal input parameters and their effects on performance indicators.
“The maximum solar cell operating temperature reduction for the proposed system compared to the conventional glass encapsulated PV system was 12.86 C,” Ahmed said. “This corresponds to a relative rise in the electrical efficiency of 7.25%.”
The researchers plan to investigate how to further reduce system costs.
“Heat pipe fabrication is expensive and significantly adds to the overall system costs,” Ahmed said. “We plan to work on experimental verification for our proposed work in the future.”
They discussed their findings in “Enhanced radiative cooling of solar cells by integration with heat pipe,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.
Researchers from Purdue University, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait have also recently applied radiative cooling to solar panel cooling. In addition, scientists at Shanghai Jiao Tong University recently conducted a review of the possible combinations between radiative cooling techniques.

They focused on the northern part of the country, which is supplied via long lines and is plagued by insufficient generation, frequent blackouts and grid instability.
Their paper, “Application of large-scale grid-connected solar photovoltaic system for voltage stability improvement of weak national grids,” was recently published in Nature.
They analyzed and compared two scenarios of solar penetration levels. They evaluated voltage stability by using the active power margin, also known as the megawatt margin (MWM), which is derived from active power voltage analysis. They also looked at the reactive power margin (RPM), and the associated critical voltage reactive power ratio (CVQR) index obtained from reactive power voltage analysis.
They found that large-scale PV can enhance the voltage stability margin of a system in terms of both megawatt and reactive power margins. They also discovered that dispersed large-scale solar PV across northern Nigeria performs better than centralized PV. The results show that dispersed PV provides better voltage stability improvements, as indicated by the MWM, RPM and the CVQR indices of the system.
“Therefore, this work has shown that employment of the vast solar resources in northern Nigeria must be seriously considered in order to satisfactorily address voltage stability issues in the Nigerian system and to meet the increasing electrical power and energy demand of the country,” said the researchers.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/06/solar-powered-hydrogen-for-domestic-applications-via-building-integrated-transparent-platform/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 6, 2022",Solar-powered hydrogen for domestic applications via building-integrated transparent platform,"A Korean-U.S. research group has created a system to produce and store green hydrogen via transparent PV (TPV) cells and transparent photo-electrochemical (TPEC) cells that could be integrated into buildings.
“We proposed a transparent, sustainable energy platform,” the research's corresponding author, Joondong Kim, told pv magazine. “Our proposed system benefits the levelized cost of solar hydrogen by on site production and building integration and offers affordable solar hydrogen for domestic applications.”
The system is claimed to have a high average visible transmittance of around 64% and remarkable color neutrality, which the scientists said has a close chromaticity to the light source. “To ensure its suitability in building-integration, especially for windows, the visual appearance of TPV and TPEC is a fundamental issue,” the researchers noted.
The system's solar power generator is based on 1.47%-efficient transparent metal oxide solar cells built with n-doped zinc oxide (N:ZnO) and p-doped nickel(II) oxide (p-NiO) on a glass substrate made of indium tin oxide (ITO). These cells are able to generate a high photovoltage of 0.546V and work as a photoanode to provide a stable photocurrent density of 2.28mA/cm2 in the TPEC system.
The PEC cell was fabricated with a TPEC photoanode as the positive terminal and platinum wire as the negative terminal. “Short wavelength UV with highly-energetic photons was mostly absorbed in the photoanode, with an efficiency as high as 82%,” the academics emphasized.
A proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is linked to the TPV-TPEC module, with the latter working as a hydrogen generator and the former being used as an axial medium to convert the hydrogen to electric power. These two systems are complementary to each other and complete the closed-loop energy supply chain, which can supply power without interruption. “In the daytime, the PV can supply electric power directly to the building and produce hydrogen for energy storage,” the researchers explained. “Hydrogen fuel is an efficient energy storage method and can be used during the night time or in periods when the PV system is disabled.”
The closed-loop system was experimentally demonstrated by connecting it to a 10mW electric fan. The PV cells provide power to operate the fan and, at the same time, the TPEC/PEM electrolyzer unit. The stored hydrogen is then used by the PEMFC, to produce more electric power to move the fan. Performance profiles of the solar cells were obtained by varying light intensity from 13.6 to 105mW/cm2. “The TPV-TPEC-PEMFC system is solid to provide the constant power supply to operate the fan without any interruption,” the research team stated. “The uncertainty of the light-dependent electric power production can be resolved by the merit of the energy circulation system of [the] TPV-TPEC-PEMFC [system].”
“This is the first demonstration of a TPV-PEC-fuel cell application, which suggests the potential for a transparent energy system as a building-integrated, uninterrupted, pollution-free energy supply,” Kim told pv magazine. “The proposed system is readily available for building structures that provide niche aesthetics, including angle-dependent transmittance, see-through features, UV blocking, and on site power production.”
The system is described in the study “Transparent sustainable energy platform: Closed-loop energy chain of solar-electric-hydrogen by transparent photovoltaics, photo-electro-chemical cells and fuel system,” which was recently published in Nano Energy.  The research group includes scientists from the Multidisciplinary Core Institute for Future Energies (MCIFE) in South Korea and the Georgia Institute of Technology in the United States. “Our study demonstrated storage possibilities for domestic applications such as fan operation and light control,” Kim concluded.

In its latest analysis of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Energy Infrastructure Update and the US Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Short-Term Energy Outlook, the non-profit SUN DAY Campaign has discovered that solar, wind and other renewable energy sources (including biomass, geothermal and hydropower) are now adding more than 2,250 MW of new generating capacity per month in the United States.
Specifically, utility-scale renewable facilities, which are defined by FERC as being larger than 1 MW in capacity, added 18,255-MW of new generating capacity in the first 10 months of 2021, for an average of 1,826 MW per month. Distributed resources, which are defined by the EIA as being smaller than 1 MW in capacity, have been forecast to grow by about 5,100 MW throughout all of 2021, for an average of about 425 MW per month.
In total, utility-scale renewables plus rooftop solar are now providing an average of more than 2,250 MW of new capacity per month. The 9,604 MW of new utility-scale solar reported by FERC for the first 10 months of 2021 is the most ever added in the United States in a 10-month period and is considerably higher than the 6,516 MW added during the same time period in 2020, or the 3,758 MW added in 2019.
Due in part to these impressive monthly additions, the SUN DAY Campaign says that renewables now provide roughly one-quarter of total US installed generating capacity, at 25.47%. This share is significantly greater than that of coal, which represents 18.77%, and more than three times that of nuclear power, which represents 8.32%.
“The breathtaking pace at which solar and wind are adding new capacity explains why renewable sources combined have eclipsed the generating capacity of nuclear power and surpassed that of coal, as well as whittled down the lead of natural gas,” said Ken Bossong, the executive director of the SUN DAY Campaign.
A year ago, the share of renewables was 23.31%. Five years ago, it was 18.58%, and a decade earlier it was 14.12%, according to the SUN DAY Campaign. It attributes this overall renewables expansion to a nearly threefold increase in wind’s share of installed generating capacity and a massive increase in solar’s share. Wind is now 10.54% of the nation’s generating capacity, while utility-scale solar sits at 5.21%, up from 0.15% in October 2011, not including distributed solar.
“Conservatively, over the next three years, renewables should expand from about a quarter of the nation’s generating capacity today to at least 30% and probably more,” said Bossong.
