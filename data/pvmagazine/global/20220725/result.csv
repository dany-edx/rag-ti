Akuo, a Paris-headquartered global renewable energy producer and developer, placed an order for 500 MW of First Solar thin film solar modules. Under the agreement, First Solar will supply 200 MW for a utility-scale project developed by Akuo in the United States, with delivery scheduled for the first half of 2024. The remaining modules are expected to be delivered in 2025 and 2026, potentially for projects in Europe or other regions.
As a renewable energy developer, Akuo has a presence in 15 countries, including the United States, Spain, Greece, and Portugal. At the end of 2021, Akuo had 1.4 GW of assets in operation or under construction and a project development pipeline of over 7 GW. The agreement with First Solar leverages First Solar’s agile contracting approach, allowing Akuo to benefit from the evolution of First Solar’s advanced cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin film module technology platform over the span of the agreement.
“The solar industry operates against a backdrop of volatility and uncertainty, and this agreement is part of a broader effort to reduce the long-term supply risks of our global portfolio to actually deliver our projects,” said Eric Scotto, chief executive officer of Akuo. “First Solar’s ability to provide supply chain traceability and its commitment to responsible manufacturing was crucial to us. It leads the industry with its long history of establishing benchmarks in supply chain transparency and the low environmental footprint of its technology, all of which reflects our shared value of responsible business practices. As a European player, we are strongly committed to these values echoing our ambition for the planet.”
Last August, First Solar broke ground on its third manufacturing facility in Ohio. The new 3.3 GW facility is scheduled to start operations in the first half of 2023 and represents a $680 million investment. When it is fully operational, the facility is expected to scale the company’s northwestern Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6 GW, which would make it the largest fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing complex outside of China.
A recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) calls for diversifying the global supply chain in order to meet climate goals. One of the downsides in using solar products manufactured in China has been the amount of carbon used to produce products for use in generating clean energy. And for installations outside of China, transportation adds to the cost and total emissions. The report also points to supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and recommends that countries increase resilience by making the investments needed to boost domestic manufacturing. The IEA report estimates that new solar manufacturing facilities along the supply chain could attract $120 billion in investment by 2030. In addition to its Ohio manufacturing facilities, First Solar also operates factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, and is building a new 3.3 GW factory in India that is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2023.
“We’re pleased to welcome Akuo to a growing number of long-term strategic partnerships with experienced global developers that have placed their trust in First Solar and our technology,” said Georges Antoun, chief commercial officer, First Solar. “Developers in Europe are recognizing the risks associated with having a geographically concentrated solar supply chain and are electing to take a long-term approach to supply diversity and security by working with us. Our differentiation rests as much on our ability to help our customers navigate volatility and uncertainty as our technology.”
First Solar recently announced other large orders from solar developers including a  2 GW order from National Grid, a 4 GW order from Silicon Ranch, a 1.5 GW order from SoftBank subsidiary SB Energy Global, and a commitment from Lightsource bp and bp to procure 5.4 GW.

The 337-year-old Groot Constantia farm, in the Constantia suburb of Cape Town, is trying to raise the funds for a 165 kW solar system to power its winemaking and restaurant operations.
Fellow Cape Town business Sun Exchange is running the crowdsale, under a business model which enables investors to fund individual solar cells, at a cost of ZAR 64 ($3.80) each.
Once all 43,448 cells are funded, the system will be installed and the farm will pay for the solar electricity generated at less than the wholesale price, giving Sun Exchange investors a 20-year revenue stream.
An update provided by Sun Exchange this week indicated 633 investors from 61 countries had backed the crowdsale by investing a total of more than ZAR 2 million in 72% of the solar cells available.
At ZAR 64 per cell, the solar system will cost a total ZAR 2.78 million.
Sun Exchange said last week its projects have generated more than 12 GWh of solar electricity to date and have attracted investors from 180 countries.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/25/belgiums-flanders-region-wants-to-retroactively-cancel-green-certificates-for-large-pv-systems/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,BELGIUM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 25, 2022",Belgium’s Flanders region wants to retroactively cancel green certificates for large PV systems,"The energy minister of the Belgian macro-region of Flanders, Zuhal Demir, has recently revealed a plan to stop granting green certificates to some renewable energy installations deployed between 2009 and 2013 under the region's green certificate scheme.
Demir's proposal is intended at saving around €1.2 billion and should affect approximately 1,200 PV system owners, which would not receive the green certificates they should be awarded for the next 10 years. “These are large installations that reached their payback time a long time ago,” the minister said in a statement. “The European rules on state aid speak in our favor, and there is no such thing as a right to over-subsidization.”
“The draft law proposes that all emission of Green Certificates (GC) to larger PV-systems installed between 2009 and 2013 would be stopped starting from January 1, 2024,” Dirk Van Evercooren, managing director of Flemish renewable energy association Organisatie voor Duurzame Energie (ODE) Vlaanderen, told pv magazine. “This would apply to all PV systems operated by companies, local authorities, organizations, and cooperatives that exceed the so-called ‘de-minimis’ threshold defined by the European state aid regulations, which means all installations that received €200.000 in subsidies over the previous three years. 
According to Van Evercooren, it is very hard to estimate the impact accurately, both in terms of which installations will be impacted and their size, as well as the number of owners that might suffer a cut in their cashflows. “About 500 MW of capacity could be affected, although this might still be an optimistic figure,” he said. “The minister herself spoke about 200 companies that would be impacted, but this is most likely an underestimation.”
The claims of the Flemish government are based on a report by UK consultancy firm Oxera, which reportedly confirmed the high level of subsidization granted to these projects. “The study seems to be based on theoretical models only, with no consideration for the real energy market,” Van Evercooren added.
According to him, the study takes into account unrealistically high levels of self-consumption, which would be the most lucrative option, although self-consumption remains still very limited among the targeted Flemish PV system owners. Furthermore, the study assumes unrealistic price levels. “The report overestimates the revenues of the affected projects by a factor of three,” Van Evercooren went on to say. “Moreover, about half of the installations potentially affected by the proposed measure were deployed through leasing. This business model was needed in the years in which the green certificate scheme was in place, as PV was not a very well-known technology and many industrial rooftop owners were reluctant to invest themselves. The study neglects this investment model completely.”
“Our detailed analysis of over 1,200 installations potentially affected by this measure shows that it will lead to bankruptcies of pretty much all the special purpose vehicles (SPVs) owning the leased installations and in general, this action would have a negative impact also on municipalities, cooperatives and public entities,” Van Evercooren stated. “The overall balance of pros and cons would be very negative for the Flemish economy, in our opinion.”
The association ODE Vlaanderen is also questioning the legal underpinning of the draft law and said the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition may confirm that the new guidelines on state aid do not force the Flemish government to intervene in ongoing GC-schemes, only to avoid overcompensation for future investments.
Under Flanders' green certificate scheme, PV system owners were entitled to receive and sell green certificates with a validity of 20 years. Around 1 GW of commercial and industrial PV systems and 50o MW of residential solar arrays not exceeding 10 kW in size were installed under the scheme between 2009 and 2013.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/25/solar-thermal-panel-for-large-scale-applications/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY,SWITZERLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 25, 2022",Solar thermal panel for large scale applications,"Swiss startup TVP Solar has developed a solar thermal panel that can produce hot water or steam at between 80 C and 180 C for industrial process heat, district heating, and air conditioning. “Typical applications are large scale solar plants dedicated to solar heat for industrial processes (SHIP), providing pressurized hot water or steam up to 180 C to industries such as food & beverage, chemical, textile, paper, oil and gas, mining, and automotive,” TVP Solar's Vice President Business Development, Guglielmo Cioni, told pv magazine. “All of these industries have a major share of fuel consumption to produce heat below 180 C of temperature.”
The company said its MT-Power panel exhibits minimal thermal losses and no degradation over time, with an average thermal efficiency of up to 64.5% and a peak thermal efficiency of 68.6%. “The efficiency can also be higher, depending on temperature,” Cioni stated. “It may be a real booster for thermal output, by combining solar thermal to photovoltaics and heat pumps to provide enhanced output per square meter, in particular for low-temperature applications such as district heating.”
The panel has a flat design and was developed with a high vacuum flat panel (HVFP) technology developed by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). “No other non-concentrated solar technology can claim such performance,” Cioni stated “TVP Solar’s super-performing flat collectors produce heat throughout the year in most climatic conditions and geographies cheaper than liquid fossil fuels.”
The panels are built with heat absorbers with heat transfer fluid pipes welded to coated absorber sheet, a glass cover with an embedded peripheral frame, and a lightweight metal backplate. The modules are initially encapsulated with glass-to-metal sealing, which ensures durability of over 25 years, according to the manufacturer. They then go through automated vacuum-type welding of the peripheral frame and a differential exhaust process via a tunnel oven.
The panel has an absorption area of 1.96 m2 and a weight of 27 kg per square meter. It is reportedly able to generate up to 1200 kWh of thermal energy per square meter per year depending on solar irradiance and operating temperature.
TVP Solar is currently operating a 5,000 m2 manufacturing facility in Avellino, southern Italy. The factory has a fully automated line with a capacity of 110,000 m2 per year. Several systems built with its modules are currently operating across several demonstration sites.
“The size of our projects did not exceed 1 MW until 2021, but now we are only targeting projects over 1 MW, and we believe that, especially in combination with thermal storage and advanced control and management systems, our module technology may be used in projects of up to 100 MW,” Cioni explained. “Further standardization of the Balance of System (BoS) is being designed for such projects, including the expansion of the existing supply chain for the BoS.”
The existing plants were installed in Italy, France, Switzerland, UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, USA, Brazil, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands. “Our target is to continue to operate in these markets and to expand globally within five years,” Cioni concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/25/new-kind-of-black-silicon-shows-improved-light-trapping-properties/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,RUSSIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 25, 2022",New kind of black silicon shows improved light-trapping properties,"Scientists at the Institute of Automation and Control Processes in Russia have developed a novel kind of black silicon that they say has a higher near-infrared (NIR) light absorption and is better adjusted to absorb solar irradiance in the 1100-1800 nm range.
“We simply added one another absorbing layer atop black silicon, which replicates its morphology to some extent,” the research's corresponding author, Alexander Shevlyagin, told pv magazine. “We have already demonstrated solar cell operation of a silicon-silicide heterojunction without surface texturing in our previous work.”
In the paper “Mg2Si is the new black: Introducing a black silicide with >95% average absorption at 200–1800 nm wavelengths,” published in Applied Surface Science, the Russian research team explained that the new absorber layer was made of magnesium silicide (Mg2Si), which is an inorganic compound consisting of magnesium and silicon with an energy bandgap 1.5 eV. “Mg2Si is a Si-compatible optical material with superior absorbance from the ultraviolet (UV) to NIR regions compared to bare silicon,” it explained. “It has already demonstrated photovoltaic perspectives as homo-/heterojunction photodetectors and solar cells.”
The researchers implemented what they called the “silicidation” of the black silicon through a low temperature and scalable process that doesn't require an ultra-high vacuum and can be conducted by thermal evaporation and magnetron sputtering. They fabricated the black silicon substrate for black magnesium silicide preparation via reactive ion etching of a crystalline silicon wafer and then used used vacuum evaporation to cover the substrate surface with the Mg2Si layer.
“The reflectance spectrum of the Mg2Si covered b-Si nanocones demonstrates strong NIR antireflection performance when compared to starting b-Si surface,” the academics emphasized. “Our measurements confirm averaged reflection in the 200-1800 nm spectral range of 3.7% from black magnesium silicide surface, which is 5 times lower with respect to 17.6% of the bare black silicon.”
According to them, the material's improved light trapping properties should be attributed to the complex hierarchical nanocone-nanoflake
structure realized in the new compound, which resulted in the marked increase of both NIR antireflection and absorption properties. “NIR photons after being back-scattered within b-Si nanocones are effectively absorbed by Mg2Si possessing much higher intrinsic absorption coefficient over the wide spectral range,” they further explained.
The group called the new wide-band black material “black silicide” and said it may also be used for NIR optical absorbers and highly sensitive NIR devices. “The results obtained propose a simple technology to further enhanthe photoelectric conversion efficiency of the silicon-silicide tandem solar cells using a black silicon instead of pyramid-like Si surface textures as a platform for silicidation with other environment-friendly and silicon compatible silicides,” they concluded.

“In our work, we investigate how this lamination process can be applied to the highly promising perovskite/silicon tandem technology,” the research's corresponding author, Uli Paetzold, told pv magazine. “The presented solar cells are the very first prototypes and highlight that lamination is a suitable alternative fabrication method for monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. The lamination approach is particularly interesting for perovskite-based PV, as it notably increases the degree of freedom in the choice of materials and accessible deposition techniques.”
With the proposed approach, the cell's functional layers such as charge transport materials, electrodes, and perovskite absorbers are processed in the same way as in devices fabricated using the standard sequential layer deposition method. “The laminated tandem device consists of two independently produced half-stacks hot-pressed together,” the scientists said. “The combination of heat and pressure promotes perovskite recrystallization, thus creating an intimate contact at the interface.”
They applied pressure of 80 MPa and a temperature of 90 C during lamination for a duration of 5 minutes and claimed this process is beneficial to the perovskite morphology, as it reduces non-radiative recombination losses. “The perovskite thin-film recrystallizes and unites both half-stacks into a monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell,” they explained, noting that the root mean square (RMS) roughness of perovskite film decreased from 20.0 to 1.7 nm after lamination, and that the grain size of perovskite increased from 284 to 350 nm.
The laminated cell achieved an efficiency of 20.0%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.75 V, a short-circuit current density of 15.5 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 73.6%. “As expected in a monolithic tandem device, the open-circuit voltage of the tandem solar cell nears the sum of the voltage of both sub-cells,” the researchers specified. Furthermore, the device was able to retain 93% of its initial efficiency after 100 hours at a temperature of 80 C.
The scientists also noted that the solar cell also exhibited negligible hysteresis – an effect that afflicts perovskite devices because their output depends on a variety of previous inputs rather than just their immediate condition, rendering performance less predictable. In perovskite cells, hysteresis is strictly dependent on the composition of the material. Ion migration and non-radiative recombination near interfaces are generally considered responsible for the effect.
They introduced the lamination process in the paper “Laminated Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Photovoltaics,” published in Advanced Energy Materials. “Our work paves the way for new tandem device architectures to further improve power conversion efficiencies and device stability,” Paetzold said. “To date, laminated perovskite solar cells are manufactured at lab-scale and up-scaling is one of the next steps in further development of this technique. In fact, lamination via hot-pressing is an easy fabrication route, which enables production in parallel of the device half-stacks and offers a possible direct encapsulation. If we compare it to established industrial technologies like lamination for encapsulation or roll-to-roll processes, the lamination approach seems to be fully suitable for future commercial production.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/25/australian-capital-territory-charges-ahead-with-canberras-250-mw-big-battery-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 25, 2022",Australian Capital Territory charges ahead with Canberra’s 250 MW big battery project,"From pv magazine Australia
Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Chief Minister Andrew Barr announced on Monday that further funding has been allocated in the 2022-23 Budget to advance the Big Canberra Battery project with $100 million already dedicated to providing at least 250 MW of large-scale battery energy storage.
Barr said the battery project would help “future proof” the territory’s energy supply by reducing the load on Canberra’s electricity network and increasing network reliability. The project is also expected to facilitate the increased installation of rooftop and commercial solar PV across the ACT, allowing more households to enjoy the financial benefits of solar power. “After delivering 100% renewable electricity, battery storage if the next step to protect the ACT when fossil fuel generators fail during hot summers,” Barr said. “ACT Labor recognizes that low-cost energy storage is the missing link in the transition to a 100% renewable National Electricity Market.”
The battery project is to be delivered in three streams. Stream one will deliver 250 MW of grid-connected battery storage to support the electricity network. Stream two will initially seek to deliver batteries, up to 1 MW, at 14 government sites to help reduce power used in government buildings and reduce the strain on the distribution network. Stream three will see the deployment of a still to be specified number of medium-sized neighborhood batteries at sites around the city.
Barr said the battery ecosystem could potentially power over one-third of the ACT. “(The) Big Canberra Battery will involve a distributed network of batteries that will be built around the city,” he said. “The largest batteries will be used to support our electricity network. Smaller batteries would be used to power essential services such as schools and hospitals. In between, neighborhood-scale batteries will provide opportunities for local communities to participate in the energy revolution. As a combined network, this battery system can address network constraints, enable more Canberrans to have solar and shorten the pay-off period of domestic solar systems.”
Procurement processes for streams one and two are currently being developed and will open to industry in August 2022. The latest announcement comes after a call for expressions of interest from companies for the large-scale batteries closed in February 2022.
Construction of the batteries is expected to commence from 2023 with the project to be complete in 2023-24. The Big Canberra Battery project is in addition to the more than 100 MW of battery projects being developed in the ACT by French renewables giant Neoen and Australian developer Global Power Generation.
