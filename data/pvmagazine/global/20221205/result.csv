Norwegian solar module manufacturer REC has decided to cancel its plans to build a 4 GW heterojunction solar module factory in Hambach, near Sarreguemines, France.
About two years ago, REC said it wanted to invest €680 million in the new facility. However, it repeatedly delayed its final investment decision.
“At the moment we are not continuing the Hambach project due to various market changes,” a company spokeswoman told pv magazine, without providing additional details.
In July, REC said that it wanted to build a factory with a capacity of at least 2 GW of capacity in Hambach. Together with 16 other companies, it secured financial support from the EU Innovation Fund for large-scale projects.
Indian industrial group Reliance acquired REC for $771 million in late 2021.

A new report from the Clean Energy Council (CEC), in collaboration with law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, argues that efforts to address modern slavery in the clean energy sector could create opportunities for domestic supply chains in Australia.
According to the International Labour Organization, approximately 40 million people are victims of modern slavery throughout the world. The report identifies significant risk of modern slavery practices in the supply chains that support wind, solar and battery production.
Those risks include the mining of cobalt for lithium-ion battery production, which has been tied to child labor and forced labor practices in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Other risks include serious claims in polysilicon manufacturing about forced labor involving the ethnic Uyghur population in the Xinjiang region of China – allegations the Chinese government denies.
However, the report described the risk of forced labour entering into the supply chains of Australia’s solar energy industry as a result of Xinjiang manufactured polysilicon as “significant.”
Some governments have already taken legislative action on the basis of these allegations, most notably in the United States. The US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevent Act went into effect on June 21. This legislation assumes any goods produced or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang region are the product of forced labour and therefore banned.
CEC Policy Director of Energy Generation and Storage Nicholas Aberle noted that Australia is on its way to producing the vast majority of its electricity from solar, wind, hydro and batteries by 2030.
“But it’s important this shift happens in a way that is fair and equitable,” said Aberle. “As with many other modern products ubiquitous in everyday life, renewable energy technologies can have long supply chains that are linked at various points to modern slavery.”
Aberle suggested that one of the strategies which Australia can explore in order to play its part in addressing modern slavery in renewable energy supply chains “is the potential for establishing domestic supply chain capabilities. Australia has significant expertise in mineral extraction, so as a nation, we can be looking at developing our capacity to extract, process and manufacture materials and components for solar panels, batteries and wind turbines.”
“Australia would stand to benefit significantly from vertical integration in domestic production of clean energy raw materials and finished products, which will also reduce reliance on foreign supply chains,” the report states. And yet, the report’s authors concede that shifting Australia’s supply chains “does not necessarily lead to a reduction in overall forced labour as materials produced with forced labour may still be sold in jurisdictions that do not apply these standards or even used within the country of production.”
It is not yet clear whether Australia will follow in the legislative footsteps of the United States. With China as a major trading partner and Australia’s posture in recent decades as a low-tariff nation and supporter of free trade it could appear unlikely. However, Norton Rose Fulbright Partner Abigail McGregor said key nations can promote a globally recognized certificate of origin to certify products are not the product of modern slavery.
McGregor said that businesses and investors can also implement their own strategies to respond to human rights abuses, including supply chain due diligence.
To that end, the CEC has prepared a voluntary pledge of corporate responsibility in the sector. The pledge includes declarations to “adopt adequate procedures to manage the risk of modern slavery in our operations and supply chains,” and to “seek to contractually oblige our suppliers to have in place adequate procedures to manage their modern slavery risk.”
NSW Anti-slavery Commissioner James Cockayne said industry, government, the financial sector and civil society” must work together “to provide access to competitively costed, slavery-free renewable energy. If we don’t, modern slavery risks significantly complicating the just transition to a decarbonized economy.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/05/novel-approach-to-thermophotovoltaics-could-lead-to-thermodynamic-limit/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 5, 2022",Novel approach to thermophotovoltaics could lead to thermodynamic limit,"Researchers from the University of Houston has developed a new method that could potentially improve the typical efficiency deficit of solar thermophotovoltaics (STPV), due to an intermediate layer with nonreciprocal radiative properties.
Solar thermophotovoltaics (STPV) is a power generation technology that uses thermal radiation to generate electricity in photovoltaic cells. An STPV system consists of a thermal emitter that can reach high temperatures, near or beyond 1,000 C, and a photovoltaic diode cell that can absorb photons coming from the heat source.
The technology has drawn the interest of scientists for decades, because it is able to capture sunlight in the entire solar spectrum and has the technical potential to beat the Shockley-Queisser limit of traditional photovoltaics. However, the efficiencies reported thus far have been too low to make it commercially viable, as STPV devices still suffer from optical and thermal losses.
The US group said its new “nonreciprocal STPV” approach could help to bring the technology closer to the thermodynamic limit, which is the absolute maximum theoretically possible conversion efficiency of sunlight into electricity. They explained that conventional single-junction solar cells cannot generate high-energy electron-hole pairs, which are only created if the energy of the photon is higher than the bandgap of the cell. Therefore, a significant number of photons with  less energy than the bandgap cannot participate in electricity generation.
“STPV can help solar energy harvesting systems to use the entire spectrum of solar energy,” researcher Sina Jafari Ghalekohne told pv magazine. “Our approach uses an intermediate layer to tailor sunlight for better efficiency.”
The scientists said the nonreciprocal intermediate layer suppresses the back emission from the layer toward the sun and directs more photon flux to the cell. They said the system approaches the Landsberg limit in the ideal case.
“We show that the efficiency deficit is caused by the inevitable back emission of the intermediate layer towards the sun resulting from the reciprocity of the system. We propose nonreciprocal STPV systems that utilize an intermediate layer with nonreciprocal radiative properties,” said researcher Bo Zhao. “Such a nonreciprocal intermediate layer can substantially suppress its back emission to the sun and funnel more photon flux towards the cell.”
The scientists presented their findings in “Nonreciprocal Solar Thermophotovoltaics,” which was recently published in Physical Review Applied.
“Nonreciprocal STPV systems can also couple with thermal energy storage and provide electricity generation 24/7,” said Ghalekohne.
In August 2021, a group of scientists from the University of Michigan and the US Army Research Laboratory proposed a new approach to STPV. They reduced the separation between the emitter and the photovoltaic cell to a nanoscale. They called this approach “near-field thermophotovoltaics” and claimed that it could lead to high power density and high power conversion efficiencies.

“The proposed cell configuration can overcome the present limitations of solar light absorption in perovskite solar cells,” researcher Mohammad Gholipoor told pv magazine. “We think this cell can be another new solution to mitigate this problem.”
The scientists built the cell with an indium tin oxide (ITI) substrate, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on titanium oxide (TiO2), a CH3NH3PbI3 layer, a MoTe2 layer, a spiro-OMeTAD hole-blocking layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
“The excellently desirable band alignment of MoTe2 with other layers, along with its high near-infrared (NIR) absorption capacity, remarkably paves the way for achieving higher photovoltaic efficiency,” they explained, noting that the ideal thickness of the MoTe2 absorber should be around 25 nanometers. 
They found that the CH3NH3PbI3 and MoTe2 layers contributed to 61% and 39% of carrier generation, respectively. They noted that a cell fabricated with this configuration could reach a power conversion efficiency of 20.32%.
“The calculated results show an appreciable increase in the perovskite solar cell efficiency originating from the short circuit current, compared to the cell without MoTe2,” they said.
However, stacking the absorbers with different bandgaps led to a decline in the open-circuit voltage, due to the hole transport deterioration in the absorbing area.
“In order to alleviate the unavoidable issue, we inserted a graphene oxide layer with a thickness of 1.5 nm. Consequently, we observed that the open circuit voltage increases as much as 0.1 eV,” they said.
They presented the new cell design in “High-performance parallel tandem MoTe2/perovskite solar cell based on reduced graphene oxide as hole transport layer,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports. They are now trying to get experimental results in line with their simulation results.

The Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research (DIFFER) has built on these efforts by setting up RedDB, a database of 31,618 potentially interesting molecules for redox flow batteries.
The database includes information on the miscellaneous physicochemical properties of the compounds, including their redox potential and water solubility. They described the development of RedDB in a recent paper in Scientific Data. The development steps included chemical library generation, molecular property prediction based on quantum chemical calculations, aqueous solubility prediction using machine learning, and data processing and database creation.
They used a desktop computer and smart algorithms to create thousands of virtual variants for two prominent classes of organic electroactive compounds: quinones and aza-aromatics. They fed the computer with backbone structures of 24 quinones and 28 aza-aromatics, plus five different chemically relevant side groups. From that, the computer created 31,618 different molecules.
In the next step, the researchers used supercomputers to calculate nearly 300 different properties for each molecule. Then, they used machine learning to predict whether the molecules would be dissolvable in water. Finally, they created a human- and machine-readable database.
“When you work with theoretical models and machine learning, you obviously want to be confident in the results,” says Süleyman Er, the leader of DIFFER's Autonomous Energy Materials Discovery research group. “This is why we used computer programs that have proven their excellence. For this purpose, we also implemented dedicated validation procedures.”
Now that the database is live, the researchers, including academics outside of DIFFER, can use it to improve their machine-learning models used when they design redox-flow batteries. Scientists can also use it to search for interesting molecules that they could potentially synthesize for further study.

The authorities plan to introduction new mandatory PV requirements for new buildings and homes from 2025. The city government first announced plans for mandatory solar requirements in early September. The plans are still under discussion in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly.
If approved, the new rules will likely apply to new homes with rooftop spaces of more than 20 square meters and buildings with a total rooftop spaces of less than 2,000 square meters. They may also force businesses to install solar arrays on 30% of their rooftop surfaces. Some parts of the city could face requirements for 85% of all rooftops to be covered by PV.

It said it aims to improve the pricing mechanism for industrial silicon, and claimed that the move would improve the risk-management capabilities of various market entities.
Johannes Bernreuter, a polysilicon analyst, said that the introduction of industrial silicon future appears to be a reaction to the surge in silicon metal prices in the third quarter of 2021.
“Probably, this will give polysilicon manufacturers the opportunity to hedge against fluctuating silicon metal prices,” Bernreuter told pv magazine.
However, he noted that polysilicon prices have already stabilized at high levels.
“This will only be the usual seasonal drop at year end,” he said. “As to forecasts of a stronger decrease, we remain cautious for the first half of 2023.”
In late November, PV InfoLink said that polysilicon prices are on a “distinctive downward” trend, following months of high prices. It said it expects prices to fall significantly from the end of November into early December.
“Unhealthy inventory will persist in the polysilicon sector until the end of the month,” said the consulting firm, noting that it expects to see the first decline in polysilicon inventory in two years.
In October, PV InfoLink predicted that prices would fall from around CNY 300 ($41.85)/kg, excluding VAT, and to less than CNY 150/kg by the end of 2023.

Entities can secure rebates to cover 20% of the cost of buying and installing rooftop PV systems. The utility said it will now select eligible applicants through a specific call that will be launched in the middle of December.
Eligible PV systems will then operate under a net metering scheme that EPCG and the country's Ministry of Ecology, Spatial Planning and Urbanism kicked off in July 2021. The €70 million ($73.9 million) scheme is designed to facilitate the deployment of around 70 MW of rooftop PV capacity.
“EPCG did everything to simplify the process of application and installation of PV systems, and even initiated the amendment of the Law on Spatial Planning and Building Construction, which exempted the owners of PV systems with a capacity of less than 30 kW from requesting urban planning and technical approval,” the utility said in a statement.
EPCG is also building a 100 MW solar project in partnership with Finnish utility Fortum, as well as a floating PV plant.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Montenegro had just 7 MW of installed solar capacity at the end of 2021. Most of its electrical power demand is currently met by the 225 MW Pljevlja thermal power plant and two large hydropower plants, at Perućica (307 MW) and Piva (363 MW).

The company said it will start selling its Eneplat system in Japan from February.
“In addition, from next summer we will also sell an upgraded version of our AiSEG2 management system that links various home appliances and equipment with Eneplat,” it said.
The company said its new V2H system is the first in the industry to handle the simultaneous charging and discharging of electric vehicles and batteries. The AiSEG2 system can reportedly forecast surplus power based on daily power consumption and automatically control the charging and discharging of batteries..
It has a rated output of 6 kW and can be charged with a maximum PV power output of 9 kW. The standard lithium-ion battery has a storage capacity of 6.7 kWh.
“The V2H system has a compact size and can be installed on a floor space smaller than that of one air conditioner outdoor unit,” Panasonic explained, adding it measures 1,250 mm x 420 mm x 210 mm and weighs 60 kg. “It is easy to install, even in a limited space in a parking lot.”
It said the system can increase the self-consumption rate of homes with rooftop PV and storage from about 50% to approximately 90%. It will sell for JPY 1.76 million ($13,075).
The company also said that in February, it will reveal which electric car models will be compatible with the new V2G system.

The US Department of Commerce has issued a preliminary determination stating that certain companies in Southeast Asia are circumventing anti-dumping/countervailing duties (AD/CVD) imposed on Chinese solar products.
The ruling is in response to the AD/CVD case filed in February by Auxin Solar, a small US panel assembler, against Malaysia, Thailand, and now Cambodia. The filing came just months after the Department of Commerce tossed out an earlier similar request by an anonymous group of solar companies that sought tariffs on a handful of companies that import modules. About 80% of US crystalline-silicon modules are shipped from Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand. Auxin Solar claims Chinese manufacturers are shipping cells to these countries to avoid paying tariffs that have been in place since 2012.
“We’re obviously disappointed that commerce elected to exceed its legal authority. As a basic fact, solar cell and module manufacturing greatly exceed the anticircumvention statute’s ‘minor or insignificant processing’ limitation,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
At the time of the filing, SEIA estimated that the implementation of AD/CV tariffs would result in the loss of 16 GW of new solar installations, a figure which represents more than half of what was installed in the United States last year. In addition to project delays and cancellations, SEIA estimated that enacted tariffs could put put 70,000 US solar jobs at risk.

Hopper said that the only good news about the announcement is that the Department of Commerce didn’t target all imports from the subject countries.
“Nonetheless, this decision will strand billions of dollars’ worth of American clean energy investments and result in the significant loss of good-paying American clean energy jobs,” she said. “While President Biden was wise to provide a two-year window before the tariff implementation, that window is quickly closing, and two years is simply not enough time to establish manufacturing supply chains that will meet US solar demand.”
Michael Parr, executive director of the Ultra Low-Carbon Solar Alliance, said that the decision makes it clear that the solar supply chain is deeply challenged.
“We need to accelerate investments in solar manufacturing in low-carbon economies to build out a better solar supply chain,” he said. “PV purchasers like Lightsource bp, D. E. Shaw Renewable Investments and Silicon Ranch are demonstrating the important role buyers play in accelerating the build out of this more diverse, resilient solar supply chain. Buyers can send a powerful market signal through long-term supply agreements with low-carbon manufacturers to help ensure the development of robust PV manufacturing capacity for the future.”
A recent report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows that prices soared throughout the US economy between the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of this year due to disruptions including the AD/CVD filing. Reports from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed that while developers had planned to install 17.8 GW in the first half of 2022, only 4.2 GW was installed and brought online – pointing to module supply challenges, which led to cancellations and delays.
“This is a mistake we will have to deal with for the next several years,” Hopper concluded.
