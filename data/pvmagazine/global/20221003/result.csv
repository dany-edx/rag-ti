They described their findings in “Towards a repair research agenda for off-grid solar e-waste in the Global South,” which was recently published in Nature Energy.
According to data from Lighting Africa, Lighting Global, and the Global Off-Grid Lighting Association (GOGLA), more than 35 million small solar off-grid products were sold in 2019. That equates to around $1.75 billion in sales, mostly in the form of solar lanterns and small solar home systems.
“Many, perhaps even the majority, of solar products sold in the Global South are described as being ‘generic, copycat and counterfeit (photovoltaic) products,' and often only have working lives of a couple of years,” the researchers said. “Even branded, small-scale solar products usually only have one-year warranties, with an expected working life of three to four years.”
The researchers said the recycling schemes currently are inefficient, due to a lack the infrastructure and institutional capacity of Global South nations, where the solar e-waste problem is most prevalent. Instead, they argued, the focus should be on repairing such devices.
“Repair is a more salient approach for addressing solar e-waste, as it addresses e-waste much earlier on in the stream, it can provide economic benefits to the communities who do the repairing, and it can operate with more decentralized infrastructure and investment, making it a potentially scalable solution to the larger problem,” they said.
The academics identified three critical areas that future research needs to focus on “to help facilitate greater focus on repair as a means to extend the lives of [off-grid solar] products.” The first is to create a detailed geography of solar e-waste products in the Global South. The second is to identify the barriers preventing the off-grid solar sector from engaging in repairable design. And finally, the researchers said they need to gain a better understanding of the potential barriers to local, informal solar e-waste repair.

To drive down cell prices as much as possible, researchers at City of Scientific Research and Technological Applications in Alexandria, Egypt, have developed a new synthesis method for sodium-ion battery cathodes that greatly reduces the cost and time needed for each preparation step.
Using Egyptian rice straw ash as a microwave absorber, the researchers synthesized, crystallized, and carbon-coated mixtures of sodium iron phosphates-carbon composites (NaFePO4-C).
The sodium ion electroactive composites were prepared using different microwave heating durations, ranging from 30 to 100 seconds. According to the researchers, the optimum synthesis time was just 60 seconds for applications in sodium-ion batteries, and as a supercapacitor.
They said that high-purity inert gases were not needed during synthesis, processing, or cell assembly, resulting in lower costs.
“The time and cost of energy consumed for the synthesis are incomparable,” said the researchers in “Ultra-fast green microwave assisted synthesis of NaFePO4 -C nanocomposites for sodium ion batteries and supercapacitors” which was recently published in Nature.

This is the largest minigrid project finance transaction in Africa to date, with the projects expected to connect more than 150,000 people to electricity in Nigeria for the first time.
Construction of the minigrids will happen over the next four years. The electricity will be provided to residential, commercial, and productive customers. This is expected to have a direct impact on the agricultural productivity, light-scale construction, and industrial activity in those communities.
CBEA will own the projects and finance the development and construction activities, according to a company statement. Engie will provide long-term operations and maintenance services.
CBEA uses a blended finance approach to invest in minigrids and will provide the private capital for the transaction alongside the Performance Based Grant (PBG) funded by the World Bank and administered by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) and the Nigeria Electrification Project (NEP), according to the company.
“Financing structures like the one between CBEA and Engie in Nigeria provide a framework for bringing even more private capital into the sector,” said Tessa Dignam, senior legal counsel at CBEA.

Its SureSine DC-AC inverters come in six models, ranging from 150 W to 2500 W, 50 or 60Hz AC frequency, and 12 V, 24 V or 48 V (DC) input options.
“That wide range of choices, along with multiple AC terminal options, results in a total of some 70-plus SureSine variations capable of providing remote power in mission-critical solar electric systems around the globe,” said the US manufacturer.
The smallest inverter measures 312 mm x 190 mm x 96 mm and weighs in at 3.8 kg. The largest measures 544 mm x 247 mm x 156 mm and weighs in at 22.1 kg. The six models have output voltages of 120 V or 230 V and an operating temperature range of -40 C to 60 C. They also feature National Recognized Testing Laboratories (NRTL) certification for the US market.
“We secured industry-leading NRTL certification as well as meeting all relevant CE and UL requirements,” said Jim McGrath, Morningstar's director of sales. “After all, our solar controllers are already standard equipment in rural telecom, oil & gas, security, large-scale rural electrification projects, and other applications where failure isn’t an option. We made sure the new SureSines live up to our long-established reputation.”
The company developed the inverters in response to client requests for inverters with system-level integration and communication with Morningstar charge controllers. It unveiled the new products last week at RE+ in Anaheim, California, and at a pv magazine webinar.

The figure falls far short of the 15% target voluntarily committed to by members states of the European Union.
The document includes 16 measures, with energy-related measures accounting for about 75% of the total. Water efficiency measures account for the remaining 25% of the proposed measures and 5% of the expected savings.
The measures account for just 31% of the 15% European gas-saving target, but the Portuguese government expects to hit the target by relying on additional measures. Installation of new solar PV capacity is expected to play the largest role. According to data from the Directorate-General for Energy and Geology (DGEG), the country expects to add 1,140 MW of new solar capacity to the grid by the end of 2022, accounting for a 50 mcm of gas savings.
In the first half of this year, the country added 546 MW of solar. By the end of 2023, the country might add 2.57 GW of the new capacity, saving 90 mcm of gas.
Projects to improve building efficiency, decarbonize of the industrial sector, and deploy renewable energy are also expected to play a role. In total, the measures are expected to reduce gas consumption by 17% by the end of 2023.

French recycling group Soren (formerly PV Cycle France) and Envie 2E Aquitaine have inaugurated a recycling center for PV modules in Saint-Loubès, France. Envie 2E Aquitaine was selected following a call for tenders launched by Soren.
The €2 million ($1.9 million) plant will be able to process 4,000 tons of panels per year and will employ 25 people. The facility is the first of its kind in Europe, as it uses a hot blade delamination process. This makes it possible to recover flat glass and isolate the polymer layer containing the cells, rather than relying on grinding, which is the main process used in recycling plants.
The technology comes from Japan-based NPC Incorporated. The consortium claims the plant will make it possible to recycle 95% of the materials used in solar panels.
“This extends the lifecycle of the components. It is a way of considering recycling no longer as a way of recycling waste but as a way of producing raw materials,” said Nicolas Defrenne, the director of Soren.
Soren launched a tender in February 2021 to set up three new facilities to recycle solar panels in France. Two of the installations have been in service since June 2021.
*The article was updated on Oct. 4 to add that NPC Incorporated is the supplier of the hot blade delamination technology.

H2X, an Australian hydrogen technology startup with a strong focus on Europe, has released the rollout details of its hydrogen-powered Warrego pickup truck.
Something of a “demonstration” vehicle, the first Warrego release features a 60 kW fuel cell, a 260 kW electric engine, and a range of more than 450 kilometers. The company said the model will be available to customers within the next nine months, “in line with availability of hydrogen.”
The pickup truck is now undergoing final validation and verification testing procedures in the Netherlands – one of H2X’s first markets to take off, ahead of European and global certification. The company said Australian certification testing, including right-hand drive models, will commence soon.
“It is true that we have had some frustrating delays over the past nine months, however, we are now well on track with our roll out plans,” said H2X Global CEO Brendan Norman, adding that the delays came down to supply chain issues, which have affected manufacturing throughout the world.

Tony Blackie, H2X Global’s press officer, has told pv magazine in the past that the company was seeking to establish the viability of hydrogen in light vehicles through the Warrego, which was based on the Ford Ranger. The feasibility of hydrogen in such applications has long been seen as dubious.
Be that as it may, H2X said it clocked AUD 50 million ($32.4 million) in order requests within four days of the Warrego pickup truck announcement in September 2021. How much that figure has grown over the past year is not known.
The Warrego’s fuel cell connects to a hybrid battery/supercapacitor electric drive system.
“This is connected to a 700-bar type four-hydrogen tank system constructed of an advanced polymer and carbon fiber base,” the company said, noting that the design delivers safety. “While this will allow the car to work at the lower 350 bar compression, it has the capability to run at much higher compression rates which will double the range per tank.”
The pickup truck will be produced in Europe and at H2X’s facility in Victoria.
“The Warrego is essentially a demonstration vehicle which we are able to offer to several customers in order to accelerate the availability of an AWD light commercial vehicles to customers,” Norman said. “This application will be applied in a more optimised form in the Darling Delivery Van and Taxi/MPV targeted for release by the end of 2024 to support the large number of cities in Europe which will be closed off from diesel and petrol vehicles from 2025.”
Europe is really where the company is focusing its attention in terms of vehicles. Norman said this is for a number of reasons, but mainly because hydrogen is available at the customer level in several cities where orders have been high and governments are keen to develop their hydrogen economy.
Longer term, H2X is eyeing Australia’s agricultural sector. Earlier this month, it launched the first of its hydrogen-powered generators to the Australian market, built to replace traditional fossil-fuel fired gensets and provide green electricity for emergency supply and off-grid operations.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/03/how-long-do-residential-solar-inverters-last-2/,"INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 3, 2022",How long do residential solar inverters last?,"From pv magazine USA
In the first part of this series, pv magazine reviewed the productive lifespan of solar panels, which are quite resilient. In this part, we examine residential solar inverters in their various forms, how long they last, and how resilient they are.
The inverter, a device that converts the DC power produced by solar panels into usable AC power, can come in a few different configurations. The two main types of inverters in residential applications are string inverters and microinverters. In some applications, string inverters are equipped with module-level power electronics (MLPE) called DC optimizers. Microinverters and DC optimizers are generally used for roofs with shading conditions or sub-optimal orientation (not south-facing).
In applications where the roof has a preferable azimuth (orientation to the sun) and little no shading issues, a string inverter can be a good solution.
In a string inverter, there is generally less complicated wiring and a centralized location for easier repairs by solar technicians. Typically they are less expensive, said Solar Reviews. Inverters can typically cost 10-20% of the total solar panel installation, so choosing the right one is important.
While solar panels can last 25 to 30 years or more, inverters generally have a shorter life, due to more rapidly aging components. A common source of failure in inverters is the electro-mechanical wear on the capacitor in the inverter. The electrolyte capacitors have a shorter lifetime and age faster than dry components, said Solar Harmonics.
EnergySage said that a typical centralized residential string inverter will last about 10 to 15 years, and thus will need to be replaced at some point during the panels’ life.
String inverters generally have standard warranties ranging from five to 10 years, many with the option to extend to 20 years. Some solar contracts include free maintenance and monitoring through the term of the contract, so it is wise to evaluate this when selecting inverters.
Microinverters have a longer life, EnergySage said they can often last 25 years, nearly as long as their panel counterparts. Usually, these inverters have a 20 to 25-year standard warranty included. It should be noted that while microinverters have a long warranty, they are still a relatively new technology from the past ten years or so, and it remains to be seen if the equipment will fulfill its 20-plus year promise.
The same goes for DC optimizers, which are typically paired with a centralized string inverter. These components are designed to last for 20 to 25 years and have a warranty to match that time period.
Failure points 
A study by kWh Analytics found that 80% of solar array failures occur at the inverter level. There are numerous causes of this.
According to Fallon Solutions, one cause is grid faults. High or low voltage due to grid fault can cause the inverter to stop working, and circuit breakers or fuses can be activated to protect the inverter from high-voltage failure.
Sometimes failure can occur at the MLPE level, where the components of power optimizers are exposed to higher temperatures on the roof. If reduced production is being experienced, it could be a fault in the MLPE.
Installation must be done properly as well. As a rule of thumb, Fallon recommended that the solar panel capacity should be up to 133% of the inverter capacity. If the panels are not properly matched to a right-size inverter, they will not perform efficiently.
To keep an inverter running more efficiently for a longer period, residential installer Those Solar Guys recommended choosing a cool, dry place with lots of circulating fresh air. It also suggested avoiding installing in areas with direct sunlight, though specific brands of outdoor inverters are designed to withstand more sunlight than others. And, in multi-inverter installations, it is important to be sure there is proper clearance between each inverter, so that there isn’t heat transfer between inverters.
Those Solar Guys said it is best practice to inspect the outside of the inverter (if it is accessible) quarterly, making sure there are no physical signs of damage, and all vents and cooling fins are free from dirt and dust.
It is also recommended to schedule an inspection through a licensed solar installer every five years. Inspections typically cost $200 to $300, though some solar contracts have free maintenance and monitoring for 20-25 years. During the checkup, the inspector should check inside the inverter for signs of corrosion, damage, or pests.
In the next edition of the series, pv magazine will examine the life of residential battery energy storage applications.
