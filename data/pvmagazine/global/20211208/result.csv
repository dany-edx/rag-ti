The company on Monday announced the production lines had been constructed ahead of schedule and had begun producing poly.
Daqo said the plant would be ramped up to full output by the end of March, at which point the manufacturer would have a total annual poly production capacity of 105,000 metric tons.
The company did not specify where the new production lines have been developed but Daqo's main production facility is in Shihezi, in Xinjiang province and the previous, Phase 3B expansion in capacity took place in Xinjiang.
Despite talk of a future glut of polysilicon production facilities, Daqo CEO Longgen Zhang reiterated the company's plan to have 270,000 tons of annual poly capacity in 2024, and said the new facilities would “be market-ready for” the production of higher-efficiency n-type solar modules.
Quoted in a Daqo press release published on Monday on the Cision PR platform, Zhang said: “With the rising prices of fossil fuels, solar PV is becoming more competitive and its economic value is being increasingly recognized by the market, as reflected by the increased prices of solar products this year, a rare occurrence in … solar PV history. We believe we are just at the beginning of a new era in which solar PV will play an increasingly critical role as one of the cleanest, most sustainable, and most cost-effective sources of energy. We expect to see accelerating growth in solar demand in the foreseeable future.”

With an initial budget of €49 million, the clean energy fund will grant-finance mini-grids and distributed generation products such as home solar systems and solar-powered lights, cooling, mills, and pumps.
With the World Bank having estimated up to $12 billion (€10.6 billion) will be needed to set up mini-grids in Africa over the next decade, the German fund has said it will partner with crowd-funding lenders such as Sweden's Trine to get solar installations and products distributed.
The Clean Energy and Energy Inclusion for Africa foundation wants to back at least 190 mini grids with a total generation capacity of almost 17 MW.
KfW is already committed to a €23.5 million program on behalf of German federal development ministry the Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung to install mini-grids in Mozambique which will power at least 7,000 homes and rural businesses, in some cases by supplying electricity for the first time. That funding line is called the Green Citizen Energy for Africa.
The new KfW fund is aiming to offer more than 350,000 people access to clean electricity.
With the new entity hoping to attract other donors, Switzerland and Australia have already signaled an interest in joining the foundation.

But in many regions there is still reluctance to move away from fossil fuels and fears that the intermittent nature of wind and solar generation is likely to cause problems to regional energy supplies. In the United States, for example, blackouts caused by extreme weather in California and Texas over the past two years are still sometimes blamed on renewables, despite the analysis showing renewables were not more vulnerable than fossil-fuel infrastructure in either case.
A new study from Mark Jacobson and colleagues at Stanford University seeks to analyze grid stability across the United States based on 2050-2051 energy demand forecasts and a 100% renewable energy-powered grid. Jacobson has worked for more than a decade on modeling energy systems driven by renewables, and is a strong advocate of policies that support 100% wind, water and solar generation for all energy needs, not only in the electricity sector.
The latest study looks at meeting continuous energy demand at 30-second intervals over a two-year period, simulating six different US states with very different climate and energy profiles – Alaska, Hawaii, California, Texas, New York and Florida – as well the currently interconnected regions of the country, and the contiguous United States as a whole.
Full details of the study are found in the paper Zero air pollution and zero carbon from all energy at low cost and without blackouts in variable weather throughout the U.S. with 100% wind-water-solar and storage, published in Renewable Energy. The group modelled scenarios involving the massive scale up of offshore and onshore wind, rooftop and ground mount PV and concentrated solar power, as well some new geothermal plants, but only already existing hydroelectric generation.
The study suggests that such a system would avoid blackouts or grid instabilities thanks to a number of reasons – partly that the system would reduce energy demand by up to 60%, partly that, as previous studies have shown, wind and solar tend to complement each other in terms of availability at different times – both daily and seasonally. And finally, additional roles for energy storage and demand response fill the gaps when there is little availability of wind or solar.
In addition to stability, the study found the same system would result in a 63% reduction in energy costs across the United States, and a reduction in required land use from 1.3% of U.S. land currently occupied by fossil fuel operations to 0.84% needed for electricity infrastructure in a 100% renewables scenario.
The cost for implementing such a transition is estimated at between $9 trillion and $11 trillion, depending on the level of interconnection between regions. The study’s authors estimate that based on the energy cost savings alone, this investment could be paid back in as little as five years. It also estimates that this energy transition would create close to 5 million more permanent jobs than it would lose, and the cleaner air and fewer pollution-related illnesses would prevent more than 50,000 deaths per year and save around $700 billion annually in health costs.
While the study mentions seasonal heat storage to meet demand in colder climates, it finds that no long-term electricity storage would be needed to keep the U.S. grid running. They note the strategy of connecting short-duration batteries in succession can provide longer-term storage, and can be discharged simultaneously to deal with strong demand peaks. “In other words, short-duration batteries can be used for both big peaks in demand for short periods and lower peaks for a long period or anything in-between,” said Jacobson.
“There is so much to be gained if we can gather the willpower to undertake the transition at a pace fitting the urgency of reaching a zero-carbon system,” added co-author Anna-Katharina von Krauland, a PhD student in civil and environmental engineering at Stanford. “I suspect that these ideas, which might sound radical now, will soon become obvious in hindsight.”

Husk in September received backing from the Nigerian Electrification Project (NEP) to install seven solar mini-grids, with the seventh expected next year. The company referred to the networks as “solar hybrid” mini grids and has elsewhere installed photovoltaics alongside battery and biomass generation, with the latter featuring the gasification of waste rice husks which gives the company its name.
Husk stated its ambition to expand its mini grid program into several states of Nigeria by 2024, with expectations of “a fleet of more than 100 mini-grids in Nigeria within the next 24 months, growing to 500 mini-grids by 2026.”
Nigeria has made mini-grids a centerpiece of its electrification policy. The nation's NEP initiative is funded by the World Bank and the African Development Bank and implemented by Nigeria’s Rural Electrification Agency.
NEP features a performance-based grant scheme pv magazine has previously reported in more detail. Under the World Bank-backed scheme, mini-grid developers can claim $350 for each electricity user connected to their networks.
The World Bank told pv magazine in 2019 that, together with the Nigerian Rural Electrification Agency, it planned to conduct a tender to set the level of such a performance grant for some 250 Nigerian mini-grids. A procurement exercise of that nature, the international development body said at the time, could significantly drive down the $350-per-user figure.
Husk, however, has told pv magazine developers now receive more than $350 for each electricity user connected.
A spokesperson for the company said only a small percentage of NEP's performance grants have been allocated thus far, adding: “There is no limiting factor to the number of mini-grids built in Nigeria as long as [developers] abide by the regulations.”
There was no tender involved with the mini-grids installed by Husk, with the company instead signing an agreement with the local authority and submitting its plans to the Rural Electrification Agency for approval and for allocation of performance grants. Developers will, typically, also have to secure other permits, relating to matters such as environmental impact assessments and technical and safety standards.
Whether the World Bank has abandoned, or delayed plans for tender-set performance grants, the latest networks established by Husk appear to signal expanded financial backing for Nigeria's electrification ambition.
Commenting on the Husk networks, Ashish Khanna, World Bank acting regional director for infrastructure in Africa West and Africa East, said: “The World Bank is a proud partner of the [Nigerian] government’s NEP. It is two years ago that the first solar mini-grid was commissioned under NEP, at Rokota village, since then significant progress has been made with 359 private sector led solar mini-grid projects under development, with the potential to provide electricity to 1.1 million people.”

The Scotland-based data company, which is owned by New Jersey business Verisk, has examined the economics of green hydrogen – electrolyzed in a process powered by renewable electricity – in 24 markets and predicted it will be competitive with less sustainable forms of the energy carrier in half of those economies by 2030.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
WoodMac today pointed to plans for large scale electrolyzer manufacturing facilities which have been announced “in recent weeks” by U.S. company Ohmium, English business Clean Power Hydrogen, Danish outfit Green Hydrogen Systems, German manufacturer Sunfire, and Australian player Fortescue Future Industries.
With similar plans having already been made by U.S. automotive business Cummins, Denmark's Haldor Topsoe, Sheffield-based ITM Power, Oslo's Nel Hydrogen, French entity McPhy, German brands Siemens and Thyssenkrupp, and New York-based Plug Power, WoodMac said economies of scale, as well as automated production and modularity will drive a “significant drop” in the cost of electrolyzers by 2025.
The scale of electrolyzer production planned, according to WoodMac, is such that a business segment able to produce only 200 MW of electrolyzer capacity per year, until 2019, had leapt in scale to 6.3 GW by the summer, with plans for 1.3 GW of production lines announced in January to March alone.
With alkaline and polymer electrolyzer membrane costs set to fall 35-50% by 2025, according to today's note from WoodMac, and solid oxide electrolyzer technology to get even cheaper, a combination of hydrogen demand and cheap-renewable-energy generation capacity will dictate where the world's green hydrogen pioneer markets will occur. That equation puts Brazil and Chile in the spotlight, according to the analyst.
WoodMac has analyzed the costs of renewables-driven hydrogen against grey, brown and blue versions of the energy carrier, powered by natural gas, lignite coal and gas-plus-carbon-capture, respectively.
While the analyst noted a huge expansion in planned hydrogen-linked, carbon capture projects, which is likely to bolster advances in blue hydrogen, it added, the recent rise in global commodity prices has harmed the economics of fossil-fuel powered hydrogen production versus its green equivalent.

Agrivoltaics could become an important new renewable energy segment in India if a proper policy framework is put into place, according to a new report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).  
For the agrivoltaics sector to thrive, measures to safeguard farming communities and agricultural production should be a key part of the policy and regulatory reforms that the sector needs, says report author and IEEFA guest contributor Dr. Charles Worringham.
Agrivoltaics refers to the combination of farming with solar generation in ways that maintain agricultural productivity. About 60% of India’s land area is farmed, so agrivoltaics are theoretically better placed in India than in most other countries.
Worringham says agrivoltaics could help India to accelerate its renewable energy rollout by distributing it throughout the country. He notes that experience elsewhere has shown that certain crops can tolerate moderate shading and that during extreme heat, some may even benefit from lower temperatures and improved soil moisture. With nearly 20 projects underway using a range of panel configurations, India has already started to establish the specific methods, crops, and conditions that work best, he adds, noting that numerous policy challenges must be addressed if the agrivoltaics sector is to reach its full potential.
Worringham says there is wide agreement on some of the needed reforms. A new agrivoltaic land-use classification will be essential, as farmland must generally be reclassified for commercial use if it is to host solar generation. 
“A classification based on the definition used by the French, of an agrivoltaic project as one that is primarily agricultural, and secondarily produces solar energy, and creates synergies between the two would be a good starting point for a special class of land use,” he says.  
Farming communities could earn additional income by selling power they generate, but they could also use some of that power. Given the unreliable nature of the Indian grid, Worringham says that new policies should prioritize the retention of land and ownership of projects by farmers themselves, while being flexible enough to allow both self-consumption and the sale of power.

“With some additional testing, our technology would be immediately applicable to real solar installations,” the research corresponding author, Anish Tuteja, told pv magazine. “We plan on doing more extended experiments soon, where the coating will be tested for a couple of years on outdoor solar panels.”
The 50μm coating consists of an optically transparent surface that exhibits both extremely low ice interfacial adhesion and toughness. It was fabricated by using a solution of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil with a weight content of 60wt% to plasticize two common industrial polymer polyvinyl chlorides known as MC2 and MC6, respectively.
The two solutions were tested in a subset of 72-cell panels measuring 2x1m on a grid-tied PV system operated by an Alaskan utility in Fairbanks during the winters of 2019 and 2020. The tilt angle of the installation was set at 45 degrees to facilitate snow dropping, and all 16 modules used for the experiment were equipped with micro-inverters. Both the MC2 and MC6 solutions were applied to the module surface glass and structural frame.
The panels were installed four-up in landscape orientation and each column including coated panels was separated by a column hosting uncoated panels. “Data on snow shedding were collected by a research-grade camera positioned normal[ly] to each array and with a field-of-view sufficient to capture the full array of experimental panels,” the scientists explained. “In a matter of minutes, both the MC2 and MC6 columns showed accelerated snow shedding, relative to the uncoated control column, with snow coverage reduced by around 61% and approximately 32% on MC2 and MC6 [-coated panels], respectively.”
The uncoated panels, by contrast, remained completely covered by snow and ice during the testing period and were able to produce almost zero electricity. Snow removal caused by wind was minimal during testing, as winds with very limited speed were registered.
The scientists found that the MC2 solution achieves the best performance, resulting in an average snow coverage area of only 27.7%, while the MC6 solution was able to achieve an average of 45.4%. The latter was found to have lower mechanical strength, which also brought delamination to the panels. The former maintained its performance and stability over the 77 days of the experiment.
The scientists emphasized that the coating technology is able to shed different types of snow and ice and said it may also be applied to building-integrated PV. “The material costs are expected to be fairly low,” Tuteja told pv magazine. “I would estimate them to be less than $1 per square footage.”
The novel technique is proposed in the paper Facilitating Large-Scale Snow Shedding from In-Field Solar Arrays using Icephobic Surfaces with Low-Interfacial Toughness, published in Advanced Materials Technologies. The research group comprises scientists from the University of Michigan, the University of Alaska, and the U.S. Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories.

Home Power Solutions (HPS), a German residential hydrogen storage system manufacturer, has expanded its product range to include a new hydrogen storage solution for commercial properties and apartment buildings.
Its new Förster solution features a control and energy management unit that can interconnect up to 10 of the company's hydrogen-based storage Picea systems. In this way, a cumulative electrical storage capacity of 15,000 kWh can be achieved.
The Picea system stores excess electricity from rooftop PV systems in the form of green hydrogen. In addition to an electrolyzer and the fuel cell, the system also includes a 20 kWh battery for short-term storage. Waste heat is also used, if necessary. According to the manufacturer, the system cannot cover the power supply all year round, but it is able to reduce heating costs.
The development of the Förster control unit opens up the possibility for new customers to be supplied year-round with solar power from their own rooftops. But it also enables the manufacturer to better benefit from economies of scale in the production of storage systems in the future. The systems can easily be cascaded and different customer requirements can be met by interconnecting identical systems. In this way, the manufacturing processes can be standardized.

“With Multi-Picea we have responded to great demand and developed a solution that offers higher storage capacities and performance in the building sector,” said HPS Managing Director Zeyad Abul-Ellla. “In commercial real estate and multi-family houses, consumers are able to use their solar power fully, even in winter, thanks to the flexible scaling of our tested year-round electricity storage system.”
The name “Förster,” which means “forester” in German, is derived from the name of the storage system. Picea is the Latin term for spruce and a Picea system saves three tons of CO2 a year, or as much as 130 spruce trees. As the control unit is able to manage up to 10 Picea at the same time, it takes care of an entire “forest,” so to speak.
The first Förster unit is already in operation. The headquarters of Josef Küpper Söhne GmbH near Bonn, Germany, is the first commercial property in the country to host the hydrogen storage system. The electricity for it comes from a 98 kW solar array spanning the rooftop and on the building's facade.
“We pursue an independent and clean energy supply for our customers and ourselves, because the time is ripe for the entry into a CO2-free society,” said Josef Küpper Söhne Managing Director Peter Küpper. “That is why we decided in favor of the Multi-Picea long-term storage system from HPS when designing the new company location.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/08/new-metric-for-50-year-solar-plant-operation/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 8, 2021",New metric for 50-year solar plant operation,"A group of researchers from Germany’s Forschungszentrum Jülich and U.S. thin-film solar module manufacturer First Solar has developed an economic model to operate a PV installation as a permanent asset with maintenance being performed at regular intervals.
The model was presented in the paper The value of stability in photovoltaics, which was recently published in Joule, where the research group stressed that the renewable energy industry is currently considering a 25-year lifetime as a benchmark for solar power plant operation, noting this parameter is strictly related to performance warranties set by manufactures and political decisions that have supported these claims.
“I wouldn’t say that solar module stability is more important than efficiency, as you need both,” the research corresponding author, Ian Marius Peters, told pv magazine. “In research, however, I see a much stronger focus on efficiency and, by now, journals also ask for [the] proven stability of these cells, but I still don’t see record stabilities being highlighted in the same way.” According to him, the emphasis that is today being given only to panel efficiencies should raise concerns in the industry, as the importance of stability for the commercial success of a solar product is not yet fully appreciated, especially the implications for the sustainability of the devices.
The scientists cited the U.S. solar company SunPower as a provider that currently offers a 40-year performance warranty for some of its products, based on low degradation rates that make them suitable for achieving over 70% of the initial yield after four decades. “A PV system owner has no reason to retire a PV system while it operates safely and generates a profit,” the scientists stated. “From this perspective, there is no reason why a PV power plant should be retired at all.”
Three economic models were initially considered by the research team: the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), which balances yield and cost of a PV system over its lifetime; the discounted cash flow analysis, which estimates the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows; and the steady-state model, which considers that an energy asset is run indefinitely and comprises all income and expenses. “The change in mindset that continuous operation requires is a transition from focusing on recovering an initial investment, to maximizing profit by managing degrading components,” the researchers said, referring to the third approach.
The trade-off between degradation rate and efficiency was analyzed through techno-economic calculations in a utility scale PV project located in Arizona and a rooftop installation in Germany in which all modules are replaced by more efficient panels, a move that, due to the increased capacity, imposes an increase in the number of inverters and cables. “Considering these effects, we numerically adjust efficiency until the economic performance is the same as that of the initial installation,” the academics specified. “Results depend on the choice of system cost parameters but are independent of specific yield.”
The U.S.-German team found that the LCOE approach is the most sensitive to trade-offs between degradation rate and efficiency, while the cash flow and steady-state models were shown to be slightly less sensitive. Those two methods, on the other hand, treated power maintenance in the same way. “In the spirit of transitioning to a long-term perspective, power maintenance is now not considered as a single event any more but as a repeating event with a fixed maintenance period,” it further explained, noting that the steady-state model allows, in principle, that more money can be spent on power maintenance compared to the other two approaches. “In steady-state thinking, there is no particular optimum maintenance time, as there is when the system lifetime is fixed.”
With the proposed steady-state mindset, the power maintenance of a solar facility should be implemented each time damage or technical issues arise. In order to help PV asset owners decide when to perform maintenance activities, the scientists introduced the concept of the minimum economically useful lifetime (MEL), which defines when replacing the solar panels becomes more profitable than not replacing them, specifying that higher degradation rates reduce MEL values and higher discount rates increase the value. “Price reductions of PV modules reduce the MEL,” they added. “If modules get cheaper, replacing old modules becomes economically attractive earlier.”
The academics assumed a learning rate for solar module prices of only 2.5% for the next three decades and found that the ideal lifetime of a PV asset may increase to 35 years by 2050. “When estimating the economically ideal lifetime, we find that a module with 0.5% annual degradation should be operated for 35 years and a module with 0.2% degradation for 50 years.”
It is important to note that one of the paper's authors is a researcher who works for First Solar, which in April announced its cadmium telluride thin-film modules reached what the company claims to be the lowest module degradation rate in the industry. “Realizing the SunShot target of 0.2% annual degradation further increases the ideal lifetime to 50 years,” the scientists said, referring to the target set for solar module degradation yield by the U.S. government through the Sunshot initiative.

Australia officially has a new big battery. Owned and operated by French renewables developer Neoen and using Tesla’s Megapack technology, the 300 MW/450 MWh battery doubles the capacity of the previous front runner, South Australia’s Hornsdale Power Reserve.
However, it is unlikely that the new big battery in Geelong, Victoria, will keep that position for long, given Australia’s bulging storage pipeline. The battery went into operation just 12 months after Neoen was awarded its grid services contract with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).
There can also be no denying that the days of naming the batteries by their state location, followed by “big battery,” will soon be over. But it appears that interested parties are eager to suck the last drops out of the tradition.
The government of Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said that the Geelong battery will “modernize the state’s electricity grid.” It also noted an “independent analysis” that reportedly shows every AUD 1 ($0.71) invested in the battery will deliver AUD 2.40 in benefits to Victorian households and businesses.
The battery has already drawn global attention – less for its size and more because of a fire in July that broke out during the battery’s commissioning, destroying two of the project’s 212 Tesla Megapacks.
Sparking renewed discussions around the safety of lithium-ion battery technologies, the investigation into the fire deemed the most likely cause to be a leak within the Megapack cooling system. The system in place to detect such faults didn’t set off alarms, though, because it hadn’t been given adequate time to “map” the control system.

NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission has been launched to test the use of solar-powered electric propulsion to protect Earth from incoming asteroids.
The DART craft, which was carried out of orbit last month by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, intentionally crashes itself into an oncoming asteroid, using kinetic energy to redirect the asteroid’s trajectory. It is designed to be propelled by an electric thruster that is powered by solar arrays.
The craft is designed to propel itself at about 250 miles per hour, guided by an onboard camera and autonomous navigation software, directly into the path of the asteroid. The DART test will make contact with the Didymos system’s moonlet that is headed into orbit in September 2022.
When the DART intercepts the Didymos moonlet, it will only change its speed by a fraction of one percent, but this change will increase the moonlet’s orbital period by several minutes, enough time to study the body with telescopes on Earth.
The solar arrays are designed to roll out when deployed, using the same iROSA arrays that were attached to the International Space Station this June. The state-of-the-art arrays were built to have bolstered radiation defense and improved power-per-mass that’s about 1.7 times more efficient that conventional panels.
The NEXT edition gridded ion thrusters used on DART can produce 6.9 kW thruster power. The thrusters use electricity to accelerate a xenon propellant at speeds of up to 90,000 mph, thereby moving the craft through space. A successful 48,000-hour (5.5 year) test was run on the NEXT propulsion system in 2009, showing little signs of degradation and operation-as-expected.
