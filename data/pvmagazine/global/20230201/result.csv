This is one of the main conclusions of new research by a group of academic institutions, led by Aarhus University in Denmark. The researchers claim that raw materials and land availability will not present real barriers to PV in its race to dominate the global energy landscape.
The scientists claim that, for an average annual generation for solar of 1,370 kWh/kW, 38 million hectares would be needed. They noted that the world has a total area of 13,003 million hectares.
“Hence, our current electricity consumption could be supplied by solar PV covering 0.3% of the available land,” researcher Marta Victoria told pv magazine.
The researchers said conventional assumptions about global PV deployment for the years to come are generally based on land cover and cost projections that chiefly consider classic, densely packed, utility-scale power plants. They claim such projections ignore the potential of vertical PV, floating installations, agrivoltaics, and building-integrated arrays, as well as other innovative PV system configurations.
“Nevertheless, these embryonic applications show that there is still room for innovation at the system level,” the academics said. “In summary, although available land can limit solar PV at local levels, it will not be a limitation at a larger scale, and therefore, we recommend that models include accurate and up-to-date constraints based on materials and land availability.”
The scientists described their findings in “Solar photovoltaics is ready to power a sustainable future,” which was recently published in Joule. They said the efficiency of solar cell technologies will improve significantly in the future, and that could help to address land-limitation issues in specific locations. They also claimed that raw material availability might only be an issue only for thin-film PV tech, and not for crystalline silicon cells, which currently account for 95% of the global market.
“Thanks to the increase in efficiency and the use of thinner contact fingers, the use of silver per watt has significantly reduced in the last years, and copper or aluminum could be used as a replacement if necessary,” the research group stressed. “The noncell materials in PV (glass, plastic, aluminum, concrete, and steel) are not expected to represent a limit either.”
The researchers also reported that solar maintained a learning rate of 23% since 1976 and that the cost of the PV technology dropped by 23% every time the capacity doubled.
“Given that the learning rate is based on module prices, it also includes the elimination of big parts of the margins in PV manufacturing due to strong competition between suppliers,” the scientists said, noting that the main factors for cost reduction are efficiency increases, economies of scale, and scientific work on silicon materials.
The study also presents some challenges PV should face in the next decade. These include the creation of regulatory frameworks that reduce soft costs, reducing capital expenditure, enabling the electrification of other energy sectors via proper tax schemes, and strengthening research on improving PV efficiency and reliability.

They can be installed in garages, kitchens, laundry rooms, or bathrooms.
The Therma V comes in two versions, with the capacity to heat 200 liters or 270 liters of water. The 200-liter model has a COP of 3.30 at 7 C and 3.50 at 15 C. The 270-liter model has a COP of 3.45 at 7 C and 3.85 at 15 C.
The electric heat pumps have a power input of  2 kW at 230 V. The 200-liter model has an annual energy consumption of 756 kWh at 7 C and 709 kWh at 15 C. The larger model consumes 712 kWh per year at 7 C, and 646 kWh per year at 15 C.
The air source heat pump uses 75% of energy from the air and only 25% of electricity to heat water, according to LG’s product website. It features LG’s Dual inverter compressor, which works with twin rotors.
“As twin rotaries balance each other while they are rotating with high speed, it reduced noise dramatically compared to the shaking single rotary compressor,” LG claims in the product's data sheet. The heat pump produces noise at 53 dBA, which is the equivalent of refrigerator noise.
The Therma V 200L measures 580 mm x 1,625 mm x 582 mm and weighs in at 100 kg. The 270 L model measures 580 mm x 2,008 mm x 582 mm and weighs 119 kg. They can operate in temperatures from -5 C to 48 C. The devices use R134a refrigerant with a global warming potential (GWP) of 1,430.
The new solution comes with a 10-year warranty for the water tank and the compressor.

Sun Cable has officially been put up for sale, following its collapse due to a dispute between two key stakeholders, billionaires Andrew Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes, over the company’s $21 billion (AUD 30 billion) Australia-Asia PowerLink project. Administrators FTI Consulting have appointed MA Moelis Australia as adviser on the sale, which could be finalized within the next four months.
The sale or recapitalization of Sun Cable is necessary to ensure the progress of its cornerstone project. If built, the 20 GW proposed solar farm, coupled with as much as 42 GWh of battery storage in Australia's Northern Territory, would send power to Singapore via 4,200 kilometers of subsea cables.
Bloomberg has reported that iron-ore magnate Forrest, whose Squadron Energy unit owns a major stake in Sun Cable, is among the parties considering an offer. There has also been speculation that Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes, whose Grok Ventures also owns a major stake in Sun Cable, will submit a bid.
The two billionaires have failed to agree on the direction of the project, with Sun Cable Chairman Cannon-Brookes supporting its current form. Forrest is reportedly looking to scrap the subsea cable element in favor of domestic energy use and green hydrogen production. In the meantime, Cannon-Brookes via Grok Ventures has provided Sun Cable with a AUD 65 million interest-free loan to maintain its employees and project momentum.
FTI Consulting now describes the first stage of the Australia-Asia PowerLink project as being “materially progressed,” as it has gained federal and local government support in Australia and a number of required approvals. However, Bloomberg has reported that lawyers for FTI Consulting have told Australia’s supreme court that Sun Cable had potential financial concerns.
“The administrators are seeking binding proposals for the sale of Sun Cable by end of April 2023, with targeted completion no later than the end of May 2023,” FTI Consulting said. “Moelis will now commence a process to invite offers for sale or recapitalization of the company.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/01/cadmium-selenium-telluride-solar-cell-achieves-20-efficiency-via-bandgap-gradient/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 1, 2023",Cadmium selenium telluride solar cell achieves 20% efficiency via bandgap gradient,"Researchers from the University of Toledo and the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory have used bandgap gradient for the first time to improve the performance of cadmium selenium telluride (CdSeTe) solar cells based on a commercial Tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer.
The scientists described their findings in “20%-efficient polycrystalline Cd(Se,Te) thin-film solar cells with compositional gradient near the front junction,” which was published in Nature Communications. They said that commercial SnO2 buffers are very stable and can be easily reproduced with desirable electron conductivity.
“Benefit from these advantages, SnO2 has been successfully used for decades in CdTe manufacturing,” they said, noting that this buffer tech has recently been replaced with zinc magnesium oxide (ZMO). “The major obstacle is the low electron conductivity of ZMO buffer, which is difficult to improve even with extrinsic doping.”
The US team said the bandgap gradient was already applied successfully in other types of thin-film solar cells with the aim of improving their open-circuit voltage, adding that it should be used in CdSeTe devices by incorporating a cadmium sulfide (CdS) thin layer in the front junction region while avoiding the formation of a detrimental interface.
“The key to this success was the incorporation of oxygenated CdS and CdSe layers before the deposition of CdTe absorber layer,” they said.
The academics built the cell with a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer, a SnO2 buffer layer, the above-mentioned oxygenated CdS and CdSe layers, a CdTe layer, and a copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) hole extraction layer.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 20.03%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.863 V, a short-circuit current of 29.2 mA cm−2, and a fill factory of 79.5%. A reference cell built without bandgap gradient showed an efficiency of 18.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.834 V, a short-circuit current of 28.9 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 76.1%.
“We have demonstrated an approach to successfully introduce a bandgap gradient penternary Cd region in Cd(Se,Te) solar cells without the formation of a photo-inactive layer and a detrimental hetero interface,” the scientists stated. “The reduced nonradiative recombination was confirmed by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) measurements.”

Soleis AG's new Minitower1 battery system can store solar power from balcony PV modules.
Throughout the day, the solar panels provide power for the basic load of apartments and store excess energy in storage systems. At night, the batteries release energy into home networks, with adjustable output from 30 W to 270 W.
Two PV modules can be connected to the storage tanks to charge the batteries. Additional modules can be connected via another connection. However, they do not charge the batteries – instead, they feed electricity directly into the home network, bypassing the battery. This ensures that the batteries in the power storage unit are charged and that the base load in the home is covered with solar power, even when there is little solar radiation.
The connections between the storage tanks and the home networks are made via sockets or plugs. The batteries are the size of home computers and are available in 1 kWh and 2 kWh versions.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/01/community-solar-up-net-metering-down-in-us-this-year/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 1, 2023","Community solar up, net metering down in US this year","From pv magazine USA
The US distributed solar market, which typically involves projects below 10 MW in capacity, doubled its market size to 8 GW from 2018 through 2022. Over the last four years, buildout has been pushed down by trade policy challenges, supply chain constraints, and persistent labor shortages, while being lifted by record-breaking retail electric rate increases and growing consumer demand for clean energy.
Wood Mackenzie said to look for policy to continue to shift away from retail-rate net metering policies and toward community solar. Net metering involves the crediting of a customer bill for sending excess solar generation to the grid, while community solar typically involves subscribers signing on for a share of generation from an off-site facility that sells wholesale power to the grid.
In the distributed-generation (DG) space, across the United States utility-backed proposals and bills in several states including California, Florida, Indiana, Idaho, Michigan, and North Carolina, sought to cut net metering compensation rates.
Likely the most impactful outcome of net metering rulemaking came out of California, where net energy metering 3.0 was approved. The rates paid to participating ratepayers who install solar after April 15, 2023, will be paid based on the Avoided Cost Calculator, a device created by utilities with the goal of avoiding cross-subsidization of solar owners by non-solar owners. The new rate cuts payments by about 75%, and this model may be used by other states if deemed successful.
U.S. retail electricity prices are expected to continue to rise in 2023 to $0.154/kWh, after a 10% increase in 2022. This amounts to an 18.3% increase since 2019. Over the same period, Wood Mackenzie said that that the national market penetration of residential solar will have grown from 3.4% to 7%.
Under new tariff rates, installers will have to find ways to aid their customers in increasing self-consumption and relying on net-metered energy less. Energy storage, proper system sizing, and microgrid-forming devices like the Enphase IQ8 are some tools in the toolkit to maximize customer value.
“Beyond self-consumption, the future holds opportunities for solar-plus-storage systems to provide value through resource aggregation,” said Wood Mackenzie. “Evolution away from retail rate net metering will accelerate the formation of partnerships between battery storage manufacturers, solar-plus-storage installers, and aggregators as they try to capture the value of providing real-time grid services via virtual power plants and package the resulting savings into initial solar-plus-storage retail offerings.”
Community solar
As net metering is phased down in many major markets, state-sponsored community solar programs are on the uptake. With just over 1 GW of new capacity expected for 2022, community solar makes up under 13% of the distributed generation market, said Wood Mackenzie.
Currently 13 states have formal community solar programs, in addition to several states that have utility-run community solar programs. These programs combine to a forecasted 7.3 GW of new solar capacity between 2022 and 2027,” said Wood Mackenzie. This growth is further boosted by a federal push for community solar and rich incentives included in the US Inflation Reduction Act.
In September, the California state legislature enacted A.B. 2136, authorizing regulators to create a new, state-wide program. Although the precise rules of the program have yet to be established, we expect the first projects could come online as soon as 2024. By 2027, Wood Mackenzie expects upwards of 250 MW of new installations annually, though this number may be revised upward significantly depending on the structuring of the program, which will take place over the course of 2023.
In 2021, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin introduced bills proposing state-wide community solar. All three will likely face opposition from political leaders and utilities. However, if established this year, these programs provide an upside to the Wood Mackenzie forecast of at least 400 MW by 2027.
Arizona Public Service (APS) filed a community solar program proposal in the third quarter of 2022, though it is unlikely to be approved in the proposal’s current state, said Wood Mackenzie. The initial request for proposals would result in 140 MW of community solar. And in Pennsylvania the prospect of a new community solar program has already resulted in early-stage development.
Leases gain ground
The solar industry still awaits guidance from the Department of Treasury on the investment tax credit bonus adders, including for domestic content, energy communities, and low-income goals. Many installers and financiers expect that it will be beneficial to offer third party-owned products (leases or power purchase agreements) regardless of the final details of the guidance.
The third-party ownership (lease and power purchase agreement) segment reached its lowest quarterly share in Q3, 2022 at 18.6% but still experienced considerable growth of 27% year over year in 2022 through the third quarter. The third-party ownership segment is expected to continue to grow and win back share starting in 2023, as it will benefit from being the only residential solar financing segment eligible for the investment tax credit adders.
Although the loan market has consistently dominated the residential solar space since 2018 and grew 66% year over year in 2022 through the third quarter, rising interest rates and dealer fees will slow the segment’s growth in the first half of 2023, said Wood Mackenzie.
Companies that only offer loans may struggle as it will be difficult for salespeople to continue selling loan products at the same pace in this higher rate environment. As such, Wood Mackenzie said companies offering multiple products will gain a competitive advantage in 2023.

Spain's largest energy supplier, Iberdrola, and Spanish PV project developer Prosolia have secured an environmental permit from the Portuguese authorities to build a 1.2 GW solar plant in the municipality of Santiago de Cacém, about 200 kilometers south of Lisbon.
Iberdrola said that the project will be the largest PV plant in Europe. It said “will be an example of strict respect for all environmental standards.” The project is expected to begin commercial operations in 2025.
“The land that will host the project has already been secured,” said Iberdrola.
The project was originally announced in September 2021. At the time, Prosolia said the plant would have a capacity of 1.14 GW and employ Tesla batteries. In yesterday's announcement by Iberdrola, however, no mention was made about the storage unit.
In December, the European Investment Bank (EIB) said that it would finance 188 MW of PV plants under development by Iberdrola in Portugal. The company has also announced plans to invest €3 billion ($3.26 billion) in solar, wind and storage projects in Portugal by the end of this year.
Prosolia and Iberdrola jointly plan to invest €850 million in the construction of four solar parks with a combined capacity of 360 MW in Spain, as well as the 1.2 GW solar facility in Portugal, by 2025.

Hydrogen startup H2i Technology says it will complete the production of 10 of its cornerstone, attachable hydrogen enhancement kits by March. The startup is manufacturing its systems via an unnamed production partner in the Australian state of Victoria.
It will test the prototype systems on the sites of five potential customers who have multiple diesel engines across the steel manufacturing, agriculture, construction, mining and hospitality/tourism industries. The systems include hardware and proprietary software to manage the injection of hydrogen into an existing diesel engine – something the company claims could potentially cut fuel usage by up to 20% and reduce carbon emissions by 300 tons per year.
“Four of the companies we will be conducting field testing with are based in Australia, while the other is in the Middle East,” says H2i Technology Chairman David Vinson, noting that the company is hopeful it will convert the field testing agreements into sales contracts.
H2i Technology appears to either be fully or partially owned by Liberty Energy Capital, an Australian investment firm with “significant positions” in 18 renewable energy companies. Those include H2X Global, Patriot Hydrogen, Sweetman Renewables, Verdant Earth Technologies, Port Anthony Renewables Limited, among others.
Branding itself as a renewable energy investor, Liberty Energy Capital’s portfolio is noticeably heavy on hydrogen projects and technologies which are green agnostic, at best. Liberty holds almost every company which has biomass-based hydrogen projects in Australia – which is certainly not zero emissions technology. Liberty Energy Capital also holds a 30% stake in Pure Hydrogen, a company which owns three gas projects, including the Windorah Gas Project in the Cooper Basin, one of Australia’s most prolific onshore petroleum basins.
