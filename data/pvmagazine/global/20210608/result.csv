On June 10, between 12 pm and 1 pm (CEST, Berlin), Asier Ukar – senior consultant at PI Berlin, a technical adviser for PV plants in Germany, and general director of PI Berlin's Spanish subsidiary – will participate in the Spanish-language networking session at the upcoming pv magazine Roundtables (free registration). Ukar covered a number of topics that will be discussed at the event.
pv magazine: Module prices are rising – how long will it last? What are the potential consequences?
Asier Ukar: The price increases are explained by a mix of factors, some of them linked to the PV industry itself, but many others, not. Most of the price increases are justified by an increase in the price of raw materials … the increase in prices is not linked to the situation of the PV industry and it is rather external to it, and it impacts our industry just as it can impact other industries. The issue of transportation … any company that imports products from China is going to pay more now than four months ago, regardless of the sector in which it works. As for the purely PV factors, we can note the price of polysilicon…
If we exclude the new solar plants built in recent years, what is the average age of a solar park in Spain? And which are the most frequent failures?
Most of the solar plants in Spain today are around 12 to 14 years old. Many of them were built with two-axis monitoring, a decision justified by high module prices and high feed-in tariffs that facilitated big outlays for EPC services. Cost was around €8.50 per watt, while for plants with fixed structures it was around €5 per watt – something unthinkable today … based on what we've seen in M&A processes or the refinancing of old portfolios, the most common issues are module malfunctions are domestic and foreign product failures, serious imbalances in monitoring systems, and inappropriate DC wiring for PV applications.
In newer plants, does quality play a more prominent role?
Banks and insurers increasingly demand more and more bankability in the choice of materials – especially the modules. Some investors are still not fully aware and sign EPC contracts on occasion without having closed the financing, and that is when the surprises arrive. We continue to find situations in which the investor has signed a full EPC contract with a company, including the purchase of modules by the latter, which in turn has signed a module supply contract with a manufacturer. When everything is closed, the bank arrives and asks that a series of quality control tests are included from the beginning linked to penalizing clauses in case of non-compliance. It is not difficult to imagine what happens next. The EPC says that it is not included in the contract with the investors and therefore does not move forward with the supply of modules. Even so, the tests must be carried out because they are requested by the bank and all the players cross their fingers so that the technical adviser, in this case PI Berlin, does not find significant failures. If such an event occurs, the investor hardly has a lever to impose penalties. To get things done right, the three contracts, including module supply, EPC and financing, must be signed at the same time ensuring the “downflow” from the bank to the module manufacturer.
It can be said that banks and insurers are increasingly aware of the importance of quality control, firstly due to the absence of generous incentive schemes that provide a certain financial cushion. And secondly, because of how rapidly the sector has been evolving at a technological level in the last years. I have mentioned the modules, but single-axis trackers deserve a separate chapter, as more and more investors are demanding additional guarantees against structural damage due to dynamic phenomena such as “galloping” … manufacturers in turn are forced to bear great pressure by the market price structure, which forces them to be very aggressive in calculations in order to be competitive. The 400 mm straps are an example of this.
 
Some companies have announced revamping plans – in particular, Germany's Baywa re in the United Kingdom. Can it be carried out in any facility? When does revamping pay off?
Revamping as a modernization measure for a PV plant is worthwhile when the technological leap between the construction date and the revamping date is large enough so that the replacement of existing components by new-generation products entails an increase substantial production, a reduction in O&M expenses and compatibility with the legal and administrative framework. We have started this year to offer technical advisory services in revamping projects in Spain and in principle all the plants built in the years 2006 to 2009 are good candidates to undergo this process. Only with the increase in the efficiency of the module from 14% to 20%, the absence of galvanic separation in the inverters or the reinforcement of the monitoring electronics of the two-axis trackers, we talk about three aspects that lead to the plants to a whole new setting. Once the improvement measures have been implemented, we would be talking about plants with the same nominal power, but with fewer modules, with more efficient inverters and with a monitoring availability of the trackers more in line with the theoretical values. Throughout this process, we must not lose sight of the legal framework, since substantial changes may imply the loss of the subsidy. That is why you have to be prudent and conservative when inserting the scalpel.
Solar module manufacturing has returned to Europe, with one startup company saying it will start vertical production of 5 GW with PERC technology in Seville in 2023. Will these modules be competitive?
It all depends on the segment they are targeting. Of course, for large-scale projects, price is still decisive and manufacturing in Europe implies a cost differential compared to China or Southeast Asia that can compromise the viability of a project. When we talk about the C&I or residential sector, it is different. For an enterprise that wants to put a self-consumption installation in an industrial warehouse, it does not make a big difference to pay €55,000 instead of €50,000, but a 10% extra cost in a 100 MW project supposes €5 million or €6 million, and this increase can kill a project. Nor can we forget that manufacturing in Europe may make us more independent in relation to the prices of transport from Asia, something that in these months many would like to have, in view of the increase in the price of the container above 600%, but the materials raw will keep coming from there. With which, in the following years we will continue to depend on China in relation to the supply of polysilicon, glass, polymer and aluminum.
More and more companies are entering the renewables market. Is there room for everyone?
Now it is complicated – some players are late because the market is quite mature. I think there is more room for small and medium projects in Spain. It will be key how the 2021-26 plan to reinforce the transport networks is carried out in order to absorb all the power that is intended to be connected. On the other hand, the regulations are beginning to be oriented more and more towards the development of smaller plants: certain barriers in projects in more than 10 hectares, some municipalities are applying moratoriums and also a certain social movement against the occupation of large surfaces is beginning to gain ground. Whoever enters now will have to innovate, take distributed generation seriously and think about hybrid solutions with storage and even the development of agrivoltaic solutions that allow the inclusion of more actors.
Will PERC continue to dominate the market?
We are seeing how n-type technology, specifically TopCon, is entering strongly. And given that at the technological level, it does not involve risks that are not already present in PERC, we do not see why it cannot begin to penetrate largely in the market. The manufacturing process of n-type cells is very similar to that of p-type PERC and the n-type technology also implies lower LID and LeTID losses, and guarantees lower annual degradation losses. Moreover, cell efficiencies are higher than in PERC and n-type cells are also bifacial in nature with bifaciality coefficients greater than 80%, as opposed to 70% in PERC. You just have to look at what some manufacturers like Longi, Jinko, Trina, Jolywood or JA Solar are doing. All have passed the early stages of R&D and are already preparing for mass production. Therefore in no time, possibly less than two years, buying bifacial TopCon n-type modules will be as normal as buying a PERC module today.

The pace of energy storage deployment slowed in the first quarter as 910 MWh was brought online, following a blistering final quarter of 2020 when around 2,000 MWh was deployed. Even so, the first quarter 2021 performance was an increase of more than 250% over the same quarter a year ago.
Wood Mackenzie and the U.S. Energy Storage Association’s (ESA’s) latest US Energy Storage Monitor reported the results and said the deployments made Q1 the biggest to date for the U.S. storage market and the third-highest megawatt-hour total for a single quarter.
Deployments are forecast to pick up through the end of the year. Wood Mackenzie forecasts that nearly 12,000 MWh of new storage will be added in 2021, three times the amount added in 2020.
Wood Mackenzie forecasts that nearly 12,000 MWh of new storage will be added in 2021, three times the amount added in 2020.
A separate report by researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) looked at diurnal storage (greater than 12 hours) and found a potential for 125 GW of installed capacity by 2050. That would be a more than five-fold increase from the current installed capacity of 23 GW (most of which is pumped hydro).
The NREL study said that battery storage capacity could be at least 3,000 times greater than today. It said that depending on cost trajectories and other variables, 2050 storage deployment could range from 130 to 680 GW, indicating a “rapidly expanding opportunity for diurnal storage in the power sector.”
In a commentary by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council published by pv magazine USA, Gwen Brown said that despite reductions in battery prices and demonstrated consumer demand, “outdated interconnection policies remain a significant barrier” to unlocking the full value of energy storage on the distribution grid.
She said that without action to remedy the shortcomings of these policies–which control which storage capabilities are recognized and how efficiently they are evaluated–the clean grid of the future “may be out of reach, at least within the timeframe needed to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.”
In particular, she said that many states’ interconnection rules do not explicitly address energy storage. She said this creates uncertainty that slows and complicates the interconnection process and that can negatively impact financing prospects.
Additionally, many interconnection policies use unrealistic assumptions when assessing the impacts of potential storage projects on the grid. “These policy flaws present significant barriers to unlocking the broad energy storage deployment that will be needed to achieve high-renewable scenarios,” she said.
The Wood Mackenzie/ESA report said that if a stand-alone storage investment tax credit (ITC) is passed by Congress this year, it could result in a 20-25% upgrade its five-year market outlook in megawatt terms.
With a stand-along ITC, the front-of-the-meter (FTM) segment would see the largest incremental growth, with an extra 6 GW of capacity through 2025. Without the federal tax break, the FTM segment could add 3,674 MW in 2021 and 6,915 MW in 2026.
In March, nearly 150 organizations appealed to U.S. House and Senate leaders to make standalone energy storage projects eligible for the ITC as part of the infrastructure package.
Public interest groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists, the National Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Environmental Law and Policy Center joined forces with solar and storage industry associations to voice their support for standalone storage ITC eligibility.
The Wood Mackenzie/ESA report said that residential storage market set a quarterly record in Q1 2021 and has grown for nine quarters in a row, breaking 100 MW deployed in a single quarter for the first time in Q1. The report said that California will continue to lead the residential segment by a “significant margin through 2026.”
The non-residential market (commercial and community-scale) is not seeing the same rate of growth as other sectors, with between 25 and 35 MW of new projects installed in each of the last five quarters.
The report said that the FTM interconnection queue now sits at more than 200 GW, its largest ever. And while many of those projects will not be built, the report found a “surge” of interconnection queue requests outside of markets that offer incentives.

Luoyang had announced the plan on December 30 but yesterday ended the arrangement after Triumph Glass Holding Co Ltd, the parent of Triumph Jinghua, confirmed neither its subsidiary nor itself would enter the PV glass market in competition with Luoyang. Triumph parent Triumph Technology Group is a controlling shareholder of Luoyang Glass.
Shenzhen-listed adhesives and chemicals supplier Huitian New Material on Friday announced a plan to invest RMB20 million into new production capacity for silicone sealant for PV module encapsulation. The investment will fund a production line with an annual production capacity of 30,000 metric tons this year at Huitian's fab in Shanghai. Huitian currently has 50,700 metric tons of annual capacity for silicone sealants plus 10,000 metric tons for double-components silicone sealants. The new production line will give the business enough capacity to produce sealant for 125 GW of solar modules.
The Energy Administration Bureau of Shandong province has released new guidelines for the latest five-year plan, in response to the 2060 decarbonization targets set by Beijing.

The processes used here often require the creation of a vacuum, the use of flammable or otherwise hazardous precursor materials, high processing temperatures and other challenges.
A group of scientists led by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, in collaboration with the Technical University of Ilmenau in Germany had these factors in mind when it looked at the deposition of silicon dioxide (SiO2), which can be used as a passivation layer or a protective layer in various types of silicon PV cells. The group notes that plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is the most common process used with this material, but requires both high temperatures and a vacuum.
The group looked into alternative processes including spray pyrolysis, low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), sol-gel deposition, and atomic layer deposition, eventually settling on atmospheric pressure deposition (APCVD) as the best option for further investigation. “APCVD holds the advantage of using gases as reactant precursors in contrast to liquids,” the group explains. “Consequently, crack-free dense films with good step coverage can readily be obtained.”
Using APCVD, the group was able to demonstrate a low-temperature SiO2 deposition process that also eliminated the use of highly flammable hydrosilane as a precursor material. And since the equipment does not have to withstand very high temperatures, the entire setup could be made of low-cost thermoplastic material produced using 3D printing, making it easily adaptable to different wafer shapes and sizes.
The group investigated two different applications for the setup in solar cell manufacturing. First, single side texturing – wafers were coated on one side with around 180 nanometers of SiO2, and then annealed at 180 degrees Celsius. Secondly, the process used to deposit a protective layer to prevent parasitic plating of metals when laying down the cell fingers and busbars.
In the first application, the wafer was then treated with an alkaline texturing solution, which etched about 100 nm of the SiO2 layer and left a smooth, uniform surface. And in the second application, the SiO2 layer was shown to effectively protect against unwanted metal deposition. “The SiO2 coated areas of the cells were practically free of unwanted metal deposition,” the scientists stated. “Whereas there was massive parasitic plating in the uncoated areas.”
Cell efficiencies were measured between 19.3% and 19.8% – below what has already been achieved in PERC cell production. However, the group notes that its focus was on measuring the performance and reliability of the coating processes, meaning there was less overall focus on the cell efficiency. Full details of the work are found in the paper Application of hydrosilane-free atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition of SiOx films in the manufacture of crystalline silicon solar cells, published in Thin Solid Films.
“The newly developed APCVD setup provides a simple and tailorable approach for the deposition of SiO2 films on virtually every substrate material at room temperature,” the group concludes. “Because of the used non-flammable and inexpensive gases, the costs of the deposition equipment and of the operations are low. The presented simple APCVD SiO2 process can find several applications in photovoltaics.”
And work is ongoing to bring the process to an industrial scale. Hannover-based coatings company Alethia is running a project focused on this, which is currently set to run until May 2022.
This article was amended on 09.06.2021 to clarify that the research was led by Fraunhofer ISE, in collaboration with TU Ilmenau.

The world's biggest module maker used the Shanghai event to launch a HJT product with a power output of more than 700 W and a claimed conversion efficiency of 22.55%. The device is made with zero cutting loss from the direct use of half-cut wafers, according to the manufacturer, and also features minimum-cell-gap technology. Trina said first-year attenuation of the product is less than 1%, with no more than 0.4% in later years. The temperature coefficient of the panel is 0.26% per degree Celsius and it offers 15% more bifacial rate than PERC rivals, according to the module giant.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
Trina’s n-type i-TOPCon panel is based on the tunnel-oxide passivated contact cell tech and offers a reported conversion efficiency of up to 24.58% in mass production. The total panel rate is 22.3%, according to Trina, for a power output of more than 700 W. The manufacturer said the device boasts an anti-hot spot feature and a first-year attenuation rate of less than 1%. The product's bifacial rate is 10% higher than conventional PERC products, added Trina.
Both new models are based on 210mm wafers.
Elsewhere at the exhibition, metal wrap-through (MWT)-focused module manufacturer Sunport claimed to have resolved the conflict between back-contacts and bifacial panels with its M series products. The product displayed in Shanghai was based on an M6 (166mm) wafer and featured 72 half-cut cells to offer a claimed bifacial rate of up to 70%, especially on highly-reflective terrain.
Sunport also launched two other module products, with the company's C10 panel featuring half-cut M6 wafers and, with help of a triple parallel connection, offering a claimed conversion efficiency of up to 21.5% and a maximum power output of up to 660 W.
The higher-spec Sunport C-Pro ‘super-high-power' panel combines MWT and heterojunction tech for a claimed conversion rate of 22.8% and maximum panel output of up to 700 W.
Inverter maker Sunways lifted the veil on three products in Shanghai, with devices for the residential and commercial and industrial markets.
Sunways’ STS 5KTL single-phase, grid-tied inverter offers a high-efficiency rate of 98.1%. The STT 20KTL has higher power density and an integrated power generation efficiency of 98.6% with a built-in, advanced MPPT (maximum power point tracking) algorithm which can reduce power loss caused by rapid weather changes and shadow multi-peaking. The STT 100KTL inverter is suitable for industrial and commercial rooftop and solar plant installation, said the manufacturer. The product's DC string voltage delivers high energy density for lower installation costs. With a claimed maximum efficiency of as high as 98.8%, Sunways said the device is smaller than rival offerings.
Growatt was showing off its new MAX125KTL3-X LV string inverter. The 125 kW per unit offered by the product is the brand's highest capacity for a distributed commercial and industrial device.
The product offers maximum efficiency of 98.7% and, with 10 lines of MPPT and 80 MPPTs for every megawatt installed, solar arrays featuring the MAX125KTL3-X LV can optimize string connection efficiency in relation to balance-of-system costs, according to the manufacturer. The average string current of 16 A is a perfect fit for bifacial, 500 W-plus solar panels, added Growatt.

This is mostly because of EU public support coming from the EU green deal and the IPCEI Hydrogen initiative. “However, time is running out to establish the many projects on the hundreds of megawatts scale required to achieve an EU target of 6 GW by 2024,” the company stated.
According to the Scottish consultancy’s new Global Hydrogen Intelligence Service, nearly half of all European electrolyzer capacity is in Germany while no other country has more than 10 MW installed. “The sector is expanding fast; the first major projects in several countries (e.g. Spain, Netherlands, Denmark) will be at the tens of megawatts scale in 2021/22 and will soar towards the hundreds [of] megawatts by 2025. A key factor in this growth will be the increase in manufacturing capacity of electrolyzer manufacturers,” the company explained, mentioning Nel Hydrogen, ITM Power, Cummins and McPhy, which “are all building factories capable of producing hundreds of megawatts, if not gigawatts of electrolyzers a year.”
The competitiveness of the different transportation options for hydrogen depends on the distance over which hydrogen is transported, as well as on scale and end-use, according to the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas, ENTSOG; the European association of gas infrastructure operators, GIE; and Hydrogen Europe, a European association representing the interest of the hydrogen and fuel cell industry. “If hydrogen needs to be shipped overseas, it generally has to be liquefied or transported as ammonia or in liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs). For distances below 1,500km, transporting hydrogen as a gas by pipeline is generally the cheapest delivery option; above 1,500km, shipping hydrogen as ammonia or a LOHC may be more cost-effective,” wrote the three European associations last month in a report. They see, in blending, “an easy entry point into the hydrogen economy,” defining it as a cost-effective transitional option, despite the modifications and related investments needed, especially for compressors. “Different compressor models react in different ways to hydrogen blends,” reads the report, explaining that the needed investments will also depend on the share of hydrogen. A complete switch to a 100% hydrogen pipeline will require installing new turbines or motors and new compressors. Capacity will then play a key role in the financial considerations. “Analyses by some gas TSOs show that operating hydrogen pipelines at less than their maximum capacity gives much more attractive transport costs per megawatt-hour transported, as additional, expensive, high-capacity compressor stations – and corresponding energy consumption – can be avoided.” Methane has three times the calorific heating value per cubic meter of hydrogen but “the same gas pipeline today transporting mainly natural gas, can transport about three times as many cubic meters of hydrogen during a given period and thus deliver roughly the same amount of energy.” Hydrogen is a much smaller molecule than methane. The tightness of the system and the material used for sealing need to be chosen accordingly, explains the report. The re-purposing costs of typical transmission pipelines for 100% hydrogen transportation are expected to be between €0.2 million and €0.6 million per kilometer. The three associations also explained that there are currently no EU-wide technical specifications related to the quality of hydrogen transported via dedicated hydrogen pipelines in gaseous form. “The absence of a harmonized EU regulation could lead to a fragmentation of the hydrogen market,” say the associations in the report, also considering final transportation costs (levelized costs of €2.30 to €4.40 for the transport of 1 MWh over 1,000km); the centrality of Europe in the ongoing projects; storage of hydrogen (in salt caverns); and the role of ports and offshore platforms.
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates are among the most competitive locations globally to produce and export green hydrogen and derivatives, say Germany-based industrial initiative Dii Desert Energy and Munich-headquartered management consultancy Roland Berger. The lowest-cost solar and wind energy globally make the GCC region potentially one of the most competitive for hydrogen production. A recent tender in Saudi Arabia was awarded for a price of $0.0104/kWh. Taking advantage of the oil and gas economy, significant funding is available through sovereign funds as well as international investors. Furthermore, the region has a proven track record in building and operating export infrastructure and it has a central location for future large-energy-demand markets such as the European and East Asian markets,” reads the report, adding that hydrogen valleys could also enable local hydrogen economies.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/08/perovskite-solar-cell-with-19-1-efficiency-via-co2-doping/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 8, 2021",Perovskite solar cell with 19.1% efficiency via CO2 doping,"Researchers at the New York University (NYU) have fabricated a perovskite solar cell using a doping technique based on carbon dioxide (CO2), rather than more commonly used oxygen doping.
The scientists described the common p-type doping process based on oxygen as one of the key hurdles to remove to bring perovskite closer to commercial production, as this technique is particularly time consuming; often requiring at least several hours to spread oxygen into a hole transporting layer of a perovskite cell.
The process, which aims to increase the electrical conductivity of cell interlayers, consists of exposing the hole transport layer (HTL) based on Spiro-OMeTAD blended with lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) films to air and light. Spiro-OMeTAD is the most common organic semiconductor used for hole-transport material in perovskite solar cells and LiTFSI is a hydrophilic lithium salt that is widely used as a p-dopant for Spiro-OMeTAD.
The implementation of this technique, on top of being dependent on ambient conditions, may often result in leftover unreacted reactants or detrimental by-products in the layer itself, the researchers stated.
Through their novel approach, the US group pre-doped spiro-OMeTAD molecules by bubbling the spiro-OMeTAD:LiTFSI solution with CO2 for one minute and under ultraviolet light. The CO2-bubbled spiro-OMeTAD:LiTFSI films were incorporated in the cell as the HTL, and the cell performance was compared to that of a similar solar cell using O2-treated spiro-OMeTAD:LiTFSI films.
The latter showed an efficiency of 17.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V, a short-circuit current density of 20.9 mA cm2 and a fill factor of 0.74. The former, by contrast, exhibited an efficiency of 19.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V, a short-circuit current density of 21.2 mA cm2 and a fill factor of 0.79. 
According to the scientists, the CO2-bubbled spiro-OMeTAD:LiTFSI also showed a conductivity that is around five times higher than that of O2-bubbled spiro-OMeTAD:LiTFSI. “The CO2 treated film also resulted in stable, high-efficiency perovskite solar cells without any post-treatments,” they further explained, noting that the O2-treated cells need post-process exposure to air to see their efficiency slightly increase.
“Besides shortening the device fabrication and processing time, application of the pre-doped spiro-OMeTAD in perovskite solar cells makes the cells much more stable,” explained NYU researcher Jaemin Kong. “That’s partly because most of the detrimental lithium ions in the spiro-OMeTAD:LiTFSI solution were stabilized as lithium carbonates during the CO2 bubbling process.”
The novel technique, which is also claimed to be able to sequester the CO2 used for its implementation, is described in the paper CO2 doping of organic interlayers for perovskite solar cells, which was recently published in nature. The research team included researchers from Samsung, Yale University, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Graduate Center of the City University, Wonkwang University, and the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology.

Switzerland-based heterojunction solar module manufacturer Meyer Burger has teamed up with three German start-ups – Authentic Network, Torwell and Syscore – to develop a smart sticker that, for solar modules, is claimed to bring real added value for PV system owners, manufacturers and installers.
Each sticker, which marks the panel with a small green tick, encrypts a digital twin of the module that can be controlled via a smartphone app. The app offers various services such as a solar calculator, intelligent support in the search for an installer, and an access function for technicians. For example, the system operator can order a repair or an exchange service with a one-touch process within a few seconds.
The sticker is based on a blockchain technology developer by Authentic Network, which stated further services are to follow. The technology is not only attractive for customers but also for manufacturers. The latter, in fact, could turn themselves into technology partners and generate new revenue streams.
Meyer Burger uses the application for the photovoltaic modules it produces in its new factory that opened in Freiberg at the end of May. According to the Swiss manufacturer, these modules should not only deliver up to 20% more energy from the same square meter of roof area, but also offer added value via the app.
“Just as intelligent multi-function cookers have their own recipes today and mix all the ingredients together perfectly, we came to the conclusion that it must also be possible for a solar module to provide the customer with more than just electricity,” said Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt. “We wanted useful digital services and information that can be easily and conveniently accessed via an app.” The sticker with the green tick makes this possible.

The geothermal project, called Sękowa GT-1, originally consisted of a borehole with a depth of 3km and the geothermal energy that was expected to be extracted from the hole was intended to be used for district heating. “Geothermal water was expected to have a temperature of approx. 60 degrees Celsius and a capacity of 40-70m3 per hour,” the Polish government said in a statement. “However, no water with the assumed parameters was found in the borehole.”
After the borehole was found to be unusable, researchers from the Institute of Mineral and Energy Economy at the Polish Academy of Sciences, along with other partners, have begun investigating how it may be recovered for other purposes and identified the use of a deep-borehole heat exchanger (DBHE), which is an alternative approach to utilizing geothermal energy, as the most suitable. A DBHE extracts heat from medium–depth geothermal energy with a depth of up to 3km, and provides a high–temperature heat source for medium–depth geothermal heat pump systems. The heat generated by the heat pumps can then reach temperatures of up to 90 degrees Celsius and be used for space heating.
The DBHE used in the project planned in Gminą Sękowa is able to reach the expected water temperature of 60 degrees Celsius and to provide heat to buildings located nearby and a recreational center, including a swimming pool. The heat demand of this complex is estimated at approximately 3,768 gigajoule per year. A PV system with a surface of around 150m2 will be used to power the heat pumps and the circulation pump of the DBHE. Excess electricity from the array will be injected into the grid when the DBHE is not operating and grid electricity will be used when the PV system is not delivering power. 
“This project is particularly important for us as we are constantly searching for solutions to stabilize our power network when increasing amounts of intermittent renewable energy are injected into the grid,” the Polish government explained.
The project is being co-financed by Poland's National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management.

He works at the Italian research agency, ENEA’s, laboratory for smart cities and communities.
“The full and coordinated transposition of the European RED II and electricity market directives, expected in the coming months, will remove some of the constraints that today limit the size of energy communities and will lead to the enabling of new types of energy services,” Caldera told pv magazine.
In terms of capacity, public investments presented in the recent National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR) aim to secure resources to install a total of 2 GW of electricity generation by 2026.
“[The] PNRR dedicates a specific investment line of €2.2 billion to the promotion of renewables for energy communities and self-consumption. The funds are dedicated to municipalities with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants, so the new power installed could be greater if energy communities and collective self-consumption spread to larger urban centers.”
Italy should install at least 6 GW per year of renewable energy capacity to reach its 2030 climate and energy ambitions.
According to Caldera, energy communities already play an important role in national energy and climate plans, with several positive externalities, like the promotion of professions locally and the ability of energy communities to increase awareness about renewables among the population.
“Energy communities are an important solution to accelerate the deployment of distributed generation with renewable sources and to increase the active and informed participation of citizens in the electricity market. In addition, they can support the economies of small municipalities and play an important role in fostering local consensus to build renewable-source plants and related infrastructure,” he said.
In many Italian regions, energy communities are present in regional energy plans and sustainable development strategies. Caldera said it is essential that regional measures are aligned with national laws to avoid delays or disruptions.
“One of the strengths of energy communities is that they can be found all over the country. Piedmont was a forward-thinking region in that it enacted a regional law (L.R. August 3, 2018, No. 12) that promoted the establishment of energy communities more than a year in advance of National Law No. 8/2020. After Piedmont, other regions have enacted, or are discussing, laws aimed at promoting the establishment of energy communities, e.g. Puglia with L.R. August 9, 2019, n. 45; Sardinia; Sicily; [and] Lombardy,” said Caldera.
He added that simplicity and clarity would be central to the success of energy communities.
“The legislator will have to take into account that the members of energy communities – private citizens, small and medium-sized enterprises, local authorities, municipal administrations – do not carry out their main activity in the energy sector and therefore their involvement requires simplicity, clarity, stability, and little bureaucracy. At the local level, most of the energy communities that have been recently established, or are in the process of being established, see municipal governments as project initiators.”
ENEA is supporting local governments and private citizens through public tools including RECON, which allows potential customers to make preliminary analyses for energy communities in the residential sector, considering funding and incentives provided by the current legislative framework.
Italy defined new rules and incentives for energy communities in the second half of 2020.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/08/computational-model-for-agrivoltaics/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 8, 2021",Computational model for agrivoltaics,"Tarek Zohdi, a scientist from the University of California, Berkeley, has developed a computational framework to optimize solar power generation in agrivoltaic projects relying on bifacial modules, as well as other agrivoltaic systems.
The novel approach, which the researcher defines as a ‘digital-twin' framework, is claimed to be flexible enough to simulate a wide variety of systems and to be able to rapidly compute the solar power flow in a multi-purpose agrivoltaic project with a reduced-order model of Maxwell’s equations. These equations are commonly used to describe how electric charges and electric currents create electric and magnetic fields. Model order reduction (MOR) is a method to reduce the computational complexity of a mathematical model in a numerical simulation.
The method considers the high-frequency decomposition of solar irradiance into multiple rays and analyzes how these rays are propagated forward in time, to assess multiple reflections and absorption for various system configurations. It also takes into account panel inclination, panel refractive indices, sizes, shapes, heights, and albedo. “The method propagates energy through a hypothetical solar farm system configuration very quickly,” Zohdi told pv magazine. “It assesses how well the hypothetical solar farm system performs in achieving desired outcomes such as PV electricity produced and energy-to-agriculture.”
The researcher further explained that the computational module gives the configuration a “score” and then tests thousands of others in an hour. “The code constantly retains the best performers and eliminates the worst ones, seeking the absolute best ones using machine learning,” he stated.
“The method allows for a solar installation to be tested from multiple source directions quickly and uses a genomic-based machine learning algorithm to optimize the system,” the academic explained in the paper A digital-twin and machine-learning framework for the design of multiobjective agrophotovoltaic solar farms, published in Computational Mechanics. “By creating digital-twins of complex, symbiotic agrophotovoltaic (APV) systems, one can safely and efficiently manipulate, improve, and optimize agriculture, careful water use, and integrated solar energy in virtual settings, before deploying them in the physical world.”
Zohdi also explained that the decomposition of solar irradiance into multiple rays can also be assessed regarding crop yield. The discrete-ray approach assumes that the ambient medium acts as a vacuum and that there are no energetic losses as the rays move through the surrounding medium. The simulations, according to Zohdi, take a fraction of a second on a laptop and potential agrivoltaic systems could be tested from multiple source directions.
“A key goal of this work was to develop an easy simulation tool that is computationally inexpensive and accessible to a wide range of researchers involved in APV systems,” Zohdi concluded, noting that his further work will focus on adding remote sensing imagery and sensor data feeds to the developed computational framework.

The South Korea-based Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) is supporting the development of a 250 MW solar PV plant for Maharashtra State Road Development Corp. (MSRDC) along a 700-km stretch of highway connecting Mumbai with Nagpur. The project will provide renewable energy for the roadway's future e-mobility requirements.
GGGI is a treaty-based intergovernmental organization that promotes sustainable economic growth in developing nations. In 2018, it entered into a partnership with MSRDC to support the Indian highway project. GGGI has provided technical assistance, investment due diligence, and debt structuring for the project. 
“This is the first renewable energy program that is aligned with a large road infrastructure project in India. GGGI has played a significant role in setting the foundation and paving the way for future green e-mobility infrastructure on the highway,” said Gulshan Vashistha, GGGI’s regional technical lead for Asia and the Pacific.
GGGI also led the preparation of technical and commercial studies, including land assessments, grid studies, environmental and social impact assessments, and detailed financial models that demonstrated a convincing business case for solar PV. Beyond the design stage, GGGI’s contribution was crucial to securing access to finance.
The project is expected to help avoid 10 million tons of CO2 emissions during its 25‐year lifetime and will create approximately 200 green jobs. It will also pave a path for MSRDC’s additional plans to construct charging stations on the highway.

RayGen Resources has secured AUD 27 million ($20.9 million) of funding to build a 3 MW/50 MWh solar hydro power plant with 17 hours of storage in Carwarp, in the Australian state of Victoria.
The project will demonstrate two new technologies: RayGen’s patented PV Ultra and its electro-thermal storage technology, for which a patent is pending. The company says these two technologies “aim to disrupt the economics of solar+storage while offering improved grid security and reliability.”
The Carwarp plant has attracted funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which has allocated AUD 15 million to the project. AGL, Photon Energy, Schlumberger, and Chevron will also make “strategic investments.”
RayGen’s ‘solar hydro’ power plant features concentrated PV technology that generates heat as a by-product, which is captured and used for thermal storage. The electro-thermal storage system consists of an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) turbine, industrial chillers, and two insulated water-based thermal storage pits or reservoirs, each roughly the size of four Olympic size swimming pools. One of the reservoirs is kept at a temperature of 90 C and the other at close to 0 C, and the temperature difference is used to generate dispatchable electricity using ORC turbines.
RayGen has been operating this technology for more than two years in its 1 MW pilot project in Newbridge, Victoria. That project also received ARENA funding. It’s expected that with the larger scale of the Carwarp plant, RayGen will be able to provide the Low Emissions Technology Statement stretch goal of providing firmed renewables for under $100/MWh.
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the innovative technology provides an opportunity to address Australia’s emerging longer-duration storage needs.
“Much like combining pumped hydro and a traditional solar farm, RayGen’s technology can provide longer duration firming for renewable energy generation. We are particularly interested in the potential for RayGen’s technology to deliver firmed renewable energy at a very competitive cost,” Miller said.
Australia’s largest electricity generator, AGL, will be an offtaker for the project. It is also collaborating with RayGen on a feasibility study to determine whether the technology could be installed at AGL’s Liddell facility, a major coal-fired plant in New South Wales that is scheduled to begin decommissioning next year.
“RayGen’s technology has the potential to provide the same capabilities as other long duration storage technologies at lower cost and with fewer geographical constraints. We believe the technology can be just as successful in the Hunter region and a key feature of our plans to transition the Liddell site into an Energy Hub, alongside grid-scale batteries and a waste to energy facility,” said AGL Managing Director and CEO Graeme Hunt.
The project will export renewable electricity to the National Electricity Market (NEM) and will also participate in wholesale energy and Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) markets once operational. It will also provide 17 hours of storage to the West Murray grid, which is notoriously congested.
The Carwarp project will be wholly owned by RayGen and is expected to reach commercial operation within 12 months, with an operational design life of 30 years. In addition to the Carwarp project, money from RayGen's AUD 27 million capital raising will go toward expanding the capacity of its module manufacturing line from 25 MW to 125 MW per annum.

Oorja Development Solutions, a decentralized solar solutions provider, has launched solar-powered cold storage as a service in the Indian state of Bihar. The “Oonnayan” cooling service allows small farmers to store perishable horticulture produce on a per-crate-per-day basis without paying any high upfront costs.
To deploy the service, Oorja Development Solutions has teamed up with Ecozen Solutions, the supplier of Ecofrost decentralized solar cold rooms. Cooling-as-a-service is quite significant for India, where around 20% to 30% of produce is wasted after harvest due to the non-availability of nearby cold storage facilities. Running cold storage facilities requires regular electricity, but grid electricity in rural areas is often unreliable. 
“While the government provides capital subsidies, these subsidies are generally available only to individual farmers up to 35% to 50%. The remainder of the project costs must be met by the farmer, making them inaccessible to most of the farming population,” said Clementine Chambon, co-founder and chief technology officer of Oorja Development Solutions. “Cooling is available as a service. Farmers can buy access to refrigerated space within a cold room installed conveniently at the market gate.”
Ecofrost solar-powered cold storage can accommodate up to 6 metric tons of perishable produce. It relies on a polycrystalline solar panel array of 5 kWp capacity mounted on the container roof and stores power using phase-change-material-based thermal energy storage, rather than conventional batteries or diesel. The thermal energy storage system can provide cooling backup for up to 36 hours in cloudy weather. 
Ecofrost charges itself completely with just five to six hours of grid power. The system can be operated and monitored remotely via an Android app that provides real-time data on stored produce and predictive maintenance alerts to reduce downtime. The system maintains a controlled interior temperature of 4 C to 13 C.
