1,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/14/meyer-burger-reports-330-million-loss-for-fiscal-2023/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,GERMANY,SWITZERLAND",RALPH DIERMANN,2024-03-14,Meyer Burger reports $330 million loss for fiscal 2023,"From pv magazine Germany
Meyer Burger, a Switzerland-based heterojunction solar module manufacturer, said it posted a net loss of CHF 292 million ($330 million) in fiscal 2023. In 2022, it recorded a net loss of around CHF 70 million.
The company said its module manufacturing capacity stood at 1.4 GW at the end of 2023. However, it only operated 650 MW of that due to price pressures in the European solar market. In addition, 365 MW of modules were in stock at the end of the year.
Meyer Burger recently shut down module production in Freiberg, Germany. CEO Gunter Erfurt said that many competitors offer their modules at prices that did not cover costs. Meyer Burger deliberately decided not to take part in this price war, partly because a small price discount granted in the summer of 2023 did not lead to an increase in sales figures.
The company is currently setting up a new 2 GW module production in Goodyear, Arizona. Its production facility for solar cells in Thalheim, Germany, will supply the US factory. It is also setting up another 2 GW solar cell production facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. To do this, it is moving equipment that was originally meant to expand production in Thalheim to the United States, said Erfurt.
He said that very strong political signals were needed to reverse the closure of production in Freiberg. The company is currently preparing to lay off employees.
It said it assumes that the growth of the US solar market over the next few years will mainly be driven by large-scale projects. The company will therefore primarily produce in the United States for this segment.
The company said it is also open to licensing its technology to third parties and is now in talks with unspecified industrial companies about possible partnerships that could also lead to such licensing models. The ownership rights would remain with Meyer Burger.
There is good news for Meyer Burger on the capital side. Sentis Capital, the group's largest shareholder, plans to provide equity financing. Meyer Burger said it wants to raise a total of CHF 200 million to CHF 250 million with a capital increase.
US project developer DESRI, Meyer Burger's largest customer, also plans an investment of up to $20 million by taking over unsubscribed shares. DESRI and Meyer Burger have been working closely together in the US market since 2022, as part of a multi-year offtake agreement.
Meyer Burger said it expects to be ready for module production in Arizona by the end of the second quarter. The ramp-up of cell production in Colorado Springs is scheduled to start around the end of this year, as long as the necessary financing comes as expected.

Thyssenkrupp nucera expects to reach 1 GW of manufacturing capacity by 2030. The German company and Fraunhofer IKTS are now setting up a pilot plant in Germany that is scheduled to start operations in around one year.
They will produce high-temperature electrolysis stacks with solid oxide electrolyzer cells, which are the core elements of the SOEC stacks. They will initially do it in small quantities to gain a better understanding of the production process and optimize it for large-scale production.
“The project timeline depends on the outcome and the learning during the pilot phase. We are jointly building it, and it should be ready for operation by mid-next year,” thyssenkrupp nucera CEO Werner Ponikwar told pv magazine. “We need to learn how that can be scaled up. We believe that towards the end of the decade, we should be in the position to have a 1 GW manufacturing facility up and running.”
The pilot plant will help the company and the research institute to adjust the manufacturing process to the requirements of large-scale production while developing SOEC stack technology. Fraunhofer IKTS bases the tech on a gas-tight oxygen-ion-conducting ceramic electrolyte with screen-printed electrodes and pressed interconnectors made of a chromium-based alloy (CFY).
“We are using different materials with respect to other companies working on SOEC,” said Alexander Michaelis, director of Fraunhofer IKTS. “But we have less components, the automatization of this process is very promising, so we will have advantages when it comes down to mass producibility.”
Michaelis said that in their initial pilot line, they aim to produce several thousand stacks per year. He noted that SOEC electrolyzers use commonly available materials, mitigating risks of price fluctuations.
“In the first pilot line we are setting up together, we will be able to manufacture several thousands of stacks a year,” said Michaelis. “The challenge is to optimize the stack and reduce the costs. We will be then ready for gigawatt-scale production.”
He said that high-temperature electrolysis offers the advantage of co-electrolysis, allowing simultaneous operation of carbon dioxide/monoxide (CO2/CO) electrolysis.
“The two processes, together, are a way to convert water and emissions into multicarbon products. So from water, you can produce hydrogen, and then green syngas,” Michaelis added. “This is particularly very important for petrochemical applications.”
He said that Germany has the longest tradition in SOEC technology. The joint project will solidify local expertise to meet European demand for green chemical components, including aviation fuels, as they will be crucial for achieving a net-zero environment.
Ponikwar said SOEC technology is very cost-competitive, similar to alkaline electrolysis, and more efficient than polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis.
“We see a strong potential for reducing costs for the stack technology, which is a major cost component,” he added.
The German company, which already produces alkaline water electrolyzers, says there is an “obvious logic” to offering both technologies, as they have specific applications. SOEC technology, for instance, is the most likely choice in proximity to industrial facilities, whose byproducts are heat and water.
Michaelis said that using water steam rather than water is also an advantage.
“There is some latent energy in the water steam, which goes into the energy balance,” he said. “This translates into 30% less power to make the same amount of hydrogen.”
Despite the potential cost advantage, mass production requires significant upfront investment. The two parties have emphasized the importance of political collaboration and financial support. 
“To implement new technologies, there are huge investment costs and steep learning curve; funding is typically required,” said Ponikwar, adding that the novelty itself and the current geopolitical and economic environment incentivize different institutions to collaborate.
The German company opened an office in Mumbai in 2023 with more than 30 engineers.
“Our interest in Germany does not mean we are not considering other regions. We need to be cost-effective,” said Ponikwar. “That would also mean that we could need to build manufacturing hubs outside of Europe, in the United States or elsewhere. India will be a quite interesting market.”
The company’s aim is to operate in different markets so it is ready to take opportunities arising from local market conditions and policies.
“In the future, when we will upscale production, we must make huge investments. There is no doubt that subsidies will be needed. We see a lot of political willingness at the state and federal levels,” said Michaelis. “We live in a global world. We are fighting for a strong foothold in Europe.”
SOEC technology can also serve the sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) market in Europe, and possibly in Asia and North America as well.

The sale to BlackRock represents its first exit from its inaugural fund, Excelsior Renewable Energy Investment Fund I LP. It divested its entire stake as part of the transaction.
Excelsior Energy Capital said the seven-year old fund, which has more than $500 million of capital commitments, has invested in solar, wind, and battery storage projects across 10 United States, supporting the generation of more than 3,000 GWh of renewable energy per year.
The project portfolio consists of operational solar and battery storage distributed generation projects with a total capacity of 89 MW (DC).
James Berner, managing director and head of Americas for BlackRock’s Evergreen Infrastructure Partners Fund, said the portfolio “represents an attractive platform investment for the core, open-ended Evergreen fund … This investment, sourced from a strong existing relationship across BlackRock Infrastructure with Excelsior, epitomizes the fund’s strategy of investing in long-dated infrastructure platforms with potential future growth well aligned with the energy transition and energy security.”
Earlier this week, BlackRock announced a €183 million investment in German PV installer Enviria. It also increased its stake in Israeli inverter manufacturer SolarEdge in January.

4,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/14/energy-sharing-in-multi-microgrid-systems-with-v2g/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",MARIJA MAISCH,2024-03-14,Energy sharing in multi-microgrid systems with V2G,"Microgrids, which are originally designed for predefined load demands, face vulnerabilities when accommodating additional demands such as electric vehicles (EVs). Merging renewable energy resources, energy storage, and EVs in a residential setting frequently brings challenges, such as overload or surplus generation, and creates dispersed microgrids, which are vulnerable if operated individually.
To tackle these issues, researchers from the University of Technology Sydney, Deakin University and Murdoch University in Australia have developed a reconfigurable multi-microgrid system that can better respond to the changing load profiles by leveraging the power of  V2G technology, as well as create techno-economic benefits for distribution network service providers (DNSPs), such as minimizing the curtailment in load and surplus generation in microgrids.
The research focuses on interconnecting a group of scattered microgrids to create a multi-microgrid system. By developing an energy management strategy to reconfigure the interconnections among microgrids, the researchers have facilitated the efficient exchange of power among these multi-microgrid systems, addressing the variability in load demands in the face of intermittent generation of renewable generation. To further enhance the flexibility of the model, they have also integrated grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and V2G concepts.
The proposed approach, characterized by its mathematical convexity, allows distributed network service providers (DNSPs) to utilize commercial platforms like CPLEX and GUROBI, which can in turn enable them to find feasible solutions more effectively, with minimal computational burden. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through its implementation on a modified 33-bus test system operated as multi-microgrid system.
“The results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach as a promising tool for optimizing the operation of reconfigurable multi-microgrid systems in the presence of electric vehicle aggregations (EVAs), leading to operational cost reduction and voltage profile enhancement,” the researchers stated.
Their findings are discussed in the paper “Stochastic scheduling of energy sharing in reconfigurable multi-microgrid systems in the presence of vehicle-to-grid technology,” which was published in the journal Electric Power Systems Research.

The report analyzes issues such as product affordability, gender inequality, customer support, further investment in minigrids, and over-indebtedness, and proposes a series of recommendations to overcome them. The indebtedness recommendation, in particular, stems from reports from 5% of customers surveyed who said they find payments for their energy product or service to be a significant financial burden.
On customer support, Kat Harrison, director at 60 Decibels, told pv magazine there is room for improvement in the way some off-grid energy companies approach after-sale support. Issues ranging from technical faults, to a lack of customer education covering how to effectively use products, risk reputational damage for businesses and the off-grid technologies they sell.
“Some of these challenges prevent end users from unlocking the full benefits of energy access,” she stated. “So many of these markets rely on word of mouth. If your neighbor or friend is sharing their experience of their new solar product – and it doesn’t work or customer service is bad – then people won’t uptake these technologies.”
Despite these challenges, Harrison was positive about the role PV and other off-grid technologies can play in improving energy access globally. “Off-grid energy offers a real opportunity to get us closer to universal energy access, with benefits at a household level, and also a community and national level. We see real productivity, community, and economic impacts,” she added.
Solar lanterns
The report was compiled using survey data from more than 79,000 respondents in 31 countries. Field workers in each country contacted customers directly based on data supplied by 164 companies.
At a product level, the solar lantern offered the greatest return on investment in terms of quality of life improvement, according to the report. Of those surveyed, 64% of respondents with a solar lantern said it had “very much improved” their quality of life, while 62% of those with a residential PV installation said the same.
Around 88% of survey respondents live in Africa and East Africa was the largest region by number of customers surveyed, accounting for 68% of the total. A further 10% of respondents live in Asia and 1% were in Latin America.
Economic impact
The economic impact of off-grid energy was investigated as part of the survey fieldwork. It revealed that although 26% of off-grid energy customers had increased spending on energy, this was often accompanied by a higher level of service, such as longer-lasting or more reliable electricity access. And while 82% used off-grid energy products at home, 11% said they used off-grid energy in their business or farm, with 7% using energy products in both locations.
Economic gains were reported by those who did use off-grid energy products for business, with 58% stating they had experienced an increase in income due to the energy access.
Financing plays a significant role in off-grid solar deployment, according to the report. Of those surveyed, 74% said they bought energy products using some form of payment plan or loan. That figure rises to 92% when those who installed a PV system at home are considered in isolation.
Economic inclusivity was also examined and minigrids were revealed as the off-grid energy solution with the highest proportion of customers living in poverty. While 41% of all survey respondents were living below global poverty thresholds, 51% of minigrid customers were living in poverty. The survey also found users living in poverty tended to report higher impacts from gaining access to off-grid energy across a range of outcomes.

Solarever has developed a new PERC solar module for rooftop applications.
“With this module, we are betting with on a unique, compact and lightweight design, which makes it easier to handle the panel with a single person,” said CEO Simon Zhao.
The 410 Black Elite, 108-cell module is available in three variants, with power outputs ranging from 400 W to 410 W and efficiencies ranging from 20.46% to 20.97%. The open-circuit voltage is between 37.10 V and 37.50 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.70 A and 13.84 A.
The panel measures 1,724 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weighs in at 20.5 kg. It is built with a white 3.2 mm tempered anti-reflective glass and an anodized aluminum alloy frame. It also features an IP68 enclosure and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The panel has a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius and its operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
The new product comes with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee. The 25-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 85% of the nominal output power.
In March 2023, Solarever commissioned a new 500 MW solar module production line at its factory in Tecomán, Mexico. The Tecomán factory is Solarever's third panel manufacturing plant in Mexico.
The company has two more factories in Tepei del Río, in the state of Hidalgo, where it is based, and in Irapuato, in the state of Guanajuato. New production equipment has raised the annual capacity of the manufacturing facility to 1.1 GW.

Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from the atmosphere and emits more. As a result, the surface loses heat and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
“The photovoltaic electricity generated in the dual system can be used for energy storage or be converted to alternating current by using an inverter,” the scientists said. “The coldness achieved on the transparent radiative cooler can be used to cool air or liquid, which can be driven by fan or pump, respectively, to interface with thermal systems for energy savings.”
The proposed system achieves simultaneous subambient daytime radiative cooling and photovoltaic electricity generation from the same area. “At night and during the day, the radiative cooler works as a 24/7 natural air conditioner,” said the research's lead author Pramit Ghosh. “Even on a hot day, the radiative cooler is cold to the touch.”
The system consists of a transparent low-iron glass radiative cooler that is able to transmit 91% of sunlight, a visibly transparent infrared-opaque layer, and a 125 mm × 125 mm interdigitated back-contact (IBC) photovoltaic cell provided by US-based manufacturer Maxeon. The radiative cooler has no direct radiative heat exchange with the PV device.
The scientists tested the system in an outdoor environment at Penn State Sustainability Institute’s Sustainability Experience Center and found it could surpass the electricity saving of a bare solar cell by as much as 30%. “We demonstrated simultaneous subambient daytime radiative cooling at 5.1 C temperature reduction under solar irradiance of about 1,000 W/m2 and solar power generation up to 159.9 W/m2 from the same area,” they explained. “We experimentally achieved ambient cooling power of 63.8 W/m2 under peak sunlight and ambient cooling power of 87.0 W/m2 at night.”
The research group also assumed the power generated by the solar cell to be utilized to power a cooling system with a coefficient of performance (COP) 2.8, and found the cooling power of the hybrid system would be five times more than the daytime cooling power achieved in conventional solar-reflective radiative coolers.
“Our work highlights the significant opportunity of simultaneously harvesting both the sun and the cold universe for renewable energy at a level that can exceed the performance of using either resource alone,” it concluded.
The system was described in the study “Simultaneous subambient daytime radiative cooling and photovoltaic power generation from the same area,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
Radiative cooling was recently applied to solar panel cooling by researchers from Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait, among others.

Kesterite is one of the most promising light absorber material candidates for potential use in lower-cost thin-film solar cells. Kesterites include common elements such as copper, tin, zinc, and selenium. Unlike CIGS compounds, there are no supply bottlenecks expected in the future. However, kesterite is still less efficient than CIGS in mass production. The world record for such cells is 12.6%, achieved for large-area devices by Japanese thin-film producer Solar Frontier in 2013.
“Copper-based materials offer excellent chemical stability, conductivity, and hole transport mobility, making them ideal for HTLs in perovskite devices,” the scientists said. “Furthermore, CZTSe is earth-abundant, non-toxic, inorganic, and eco-friendly, with a high absorption coefficient of around 104 cm−1, an optimized direct energy band gap of 0.95 eV, and outstanding stability.”
The scientists used the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, developed by the University of Ghent, to simulate the novel cell configuration.  For the top cell, they assumed the use of a wide bandgap perovskite material known as MAGeI3, while for the bottom device they considered a narrow bandgap perovskite known as FAMASnGeI3. Both materials are lead-free mixed cation perovskites.
The simulated tandem device was built with a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), an electron transport layer (ETL) based on strontium titanate (STO), the MAGeI3 absorber, a tunnel junction, the FAMASnGeI3 absorber, the CZTSe HTL, and a gold (Au) metal contact. The ideal thickness of the MAGeI3 and FAMASnGeI3 absorbers was found to be 450 nm and 400 nm, respectively. That of the tunnel junction was 4 nm.
The simulation showed that the tandem device has the potential to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 23.32 %, an open-circuit voltage of 0.970 V, a short-circuit density of 28.46 mAcm−2, and a fill factor of 84.43 %.
“It was observed that the cell efficiency depends on the tunnel junction's thickness and the front contact work function selection,” the academics stated. “Therefore, it can be determined that the Pb-free mixed cation perovskite/CZTSe tandem device performs better than the single junction device.”
The novel cell concept can be found in the study “Enhancing Solar Cell Efficiency through Tandem Structures Utilizing Lead-Free Mixed Cation Perovskites and CZTSe Absorber Layers,” published in Chemical Physics Impact. The research team included scientists from the Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Al-Baha University, and Taibah University in Saudi Arabia, as well as Pakistan's University Faisalabad and theUniversity of Punjab. It also comprised academics from Italy's Astronomy Ettore Majorana University of Catania.

“AtmosZero's proprietary Boiler 2.0 technology extracts heat from the air and delivers high-temperature steam with maximum efficiency and zero carbon emissions, allowing companies to replace their existing natural gas and oil boilers quickly and cost-effectively,” the spokesperson said.
The heat pump draws 480 V of voltage in a three-phase configuration and can produce 650 kW of thermal energy, with an output flow of 997.9 kg/hr of saturated steam. Its output temperature-pressure ranges between 120 C/199.8 kPa and 165 C/701.7 kPa.
“The coefficient of performance (COP) of the system is dependent on the ambient temperatures as well as the desired steam temperature,” the spokesperson said. “We work together with customers and perform specific analysis to give them a better insight on expected performance. That being said, our target is a COP of 2 going from 15 C ambient to 150 C saturated steam.”
The system uses an unspecified refrigerant with “low global warming potential (GWP), flammability, and toxicity.” Its footprint is approximately 2.4 meters x 6.1 meters.
AtmosZero is currently testing the system under a full-scale pilot deployed at a facility operated by US-based New Belgium Brewing Company. It also recently launched a European subsidiary.
“Our first systems deploying in 2025 will produce 165 C and in 2026 we will achieve 200 C,” the spokesperson said.

Solar Energy Corp of India has allocated 480 MW under its 1.5 GW renewables-plus-storage tender, at an average price of $0.068/kWh.
Hero Future Energies bid for 120 MW and won the capacity by quoting the lowest tariff of INR 5.59 ($0.067)/kWh. JSW Energy secured 180 MW, Serentica Renewables 100 MW and ReNew 80 MW at INR 5.6/kWh each.
The winning developers will set up renewable energy projects backed with energy storage system to supply firm and dispatchable renewable energy in a demand-following manner. The projects can be located anywhere in India and must connect to the interstate transmission grid.
The projects are to be developed on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis.
SECI will sign a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the successful bidders. Power procured by SECI from these projects has been provisioned to be sold to Punjab State Power Corp. Ltd and Madhya Pradesh Power Management Co. Ltd.

Macquarie Group announced it has completed the sale of its 15% share in the estimated AUD55 billion ($36.4 billion) Australian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) to Uk-based oil and energy company bp which has boosted its stake in the solar, wind and green hydrogen project planned for Western Australia’s north coast to 64%.
Robert Dunlop, head of Macquarie’s global resources team, confirmed the transaction on social media.
“After five productive years as an active shareholder, we are pleased to have completed the sale of our 15% interest to bp, who will continue to drive this project forward,” he said.
The sale gives bp a 64% share in the project after its initial acquisition of a 40.5% stake in 2022, which was later increased to almost 49% through share purchases from project founders InterContinental Energy and CWP Global.
Hong Kong-based green hydrogen developer InterContinental Energy and Australia-based CWP Global retain a 26% and 10% stake, respectively, in the project.
The AREH project proposes the deployment of a combined 26 GW of solar and wind near Port Hedland in WA’s northwest to power an estimated 14 GW of electrolyzers, producing 1.6 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen or nine million tonnes of green ammonia annually for the local and export markets. The developers have also allocated at least 3 GW of generation capacity for Pilbara energy users themselves.
AREH has been in the planning stages since 2014 and was first announced in 2017 as the 6 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub. It has continued to grow in scope since then and has secured state and federal government support, although it has faced some hurdles.
Despite the setbacks, bp has said it has made significant progress since taking control and is continuing to develop the project.
The company has previously indicated it is working towards a final investment decision on the multi-stage project in 2025 with the aim to start producing power at AREH by 2029, when the first phase of 4 GW of renewable power will get online. The two other stages of the project would be developed over the next decade.
The project is part of bp’s push away from fossil fuels to clean energy. In its 2023 strategy update, bp detailed plans to invest up to $98 billion in renewables, hydrogen, biofuels, and electric mobility by 2030 as part of its ambition to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner.

The global solar market continues to grow, as an estimated 413 GW was installed in 2023, rising 58% year-over-year, according to Bloomberg NEF. Along with this growth comes a rising trend in system underperformance, said a report from Raptor Maps.
Raptor Maps analyzed data collected from drones, robotics, application program interfaces (API) and Ínternet of Things (IoT) sensors. The company operates an AI-driven “drone in a box” that it deploys at solar facilities. Its dataset comprises 125 GW of PV assets, spanning 41 countries.
Among the analyzed assets, the company found $177.7 million in preventable annualized revenue losses. Extrapolated to solar assets worldwide, this would equate to $4.6 billion in potential annual revenue losses.
The report found average losses of $4,696 per MW, though losses varied regionally. Since 2019, the average losses from underperformance have increased from a 1.61% average power loss to 4.47% in 2023. Raptor Maps said this equates to an internal rate of return at loss of at least 190 basis points in a 100 MW solar asset.
One factor in increased average power losses is the increase in average system size. Raptor Maps said larger projects tend to have a higher loss percentage. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that average solar project sizes have grown from 13.9 MW in 2019 to 59.6 MW in 2023, contributing to increased average losses.
Furthermore, inefficiencies in operations and maintenance are causing potential revenue losses, said the report. In a 2023 survey, the company found “many operators identified preventative maintenance visual inspections as a significant source of time wastage, and a large number of respondents also identified validating nuisance alarms as another way time is wasted.”
Regionally, preventable losses vary widely. In the Midwest, average annual losses were modeled at $4,052 per MW, while in the Northeast, losses exceeded $6,108 per MW. The report noted that asset underperformance losses are lower in the U.S. than the global average.
What causes underperformance?
Raptor Maps identified several sources of power losses. The largest fault, following a historical trend, was at the system level. Inverter faults, string outages, and combiner faults contributed to power losses of 1.91%, 0.90%, and 0.81% respectively. Instances of tracker issues have also risen from 0.26% in 2022 to 0.46% in 2023.
Raptor Maps noted that module performance has improved slightly, with losses decreasing by about 12% year-over-year. However, with extreme weather events on the rise, median annual power losses attributed to weather events are about 1%. In certain extreme events, weather-related losses can lead to losses of up to 60%, said Raptor Maps. Hail events, particularly in booming solar markets like Texas, are a significant risk for solar asset operations.
The March edition of pv magazine is dedicated to energy storage and considers sodium-ion’s chances of toppling lithium-ion, takes a look at compressed air technology, and asks whether big or small is the best approach for African solar and storage.
Risk profiles vary by module type, said Raptor Maps. Thin-film modules averaged lower power losses from defects and manufacturing anomalies than polycrystalline and monocrystalline. However, thin-film modules were twice as likely to have physical damage as polycrystalline modules, and three-and-a-half times more likely to sustain physical damage than monocrystalline modules.
