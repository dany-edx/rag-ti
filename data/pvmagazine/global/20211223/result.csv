The solar facilities will ensure renewables “power most of [Gaziantep's] municipal buildings and infrastructure,” according to a press release published on the EBRD website.
Some €7 million of the money will be disbursed as a non-repayable grant from the London-based development lender's shareholder special fund, which exists to boost other financing packages offered by the institution. The grant will be accompanied by a €10 million, 10-year loan which is being issued as part of Gaziantep's participation in the EBRD's Green Cities initiative.
The city has a population of two million people which has risen rapidly with the arrival of 500,000 Syrian refugees and EBRD sustainable infrastructure managing director Nandita Parshad said the solar plan would also help “the city to integrate solar power into electricity grids more broadly.”
Announcing the solar plans last week, the EBRD said Gaziantep has followed the Turkish capital Ankara as well as Izmir and Istanbul into the Green Cities program and will draw up a Green City Action Plan – including details of more sustainable energy supply – financed by the international Clean Technology Fund administered by the World Bank.

pv magazine: Do you think the existing market is big enough to invest in battery storage manufacturing in India? 
Ketan Chitnis: From the series of latest announcements from the power ministry, it’s evident that the government has realized the significance of energy storage for the growth of the nation. The production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme takes care of the global competitiveness until we attain consumptions that can be competitive for manufacturing.
The minister of power has announced the requirement of 4 GWh grid-scale storage across India. This is followed by the requirement estimation of 23 GWh in Leh and Ladakh, and 18 GWh in Rajasthan for renewable integration.
We can see the echoes of the same from various agencies like Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI), NTPC, Energy Efficiency Services Ltd. (EESL) on immediate expressions of interest, and (request for quotations). So we are bullish on these initiatives.
The decision to invest in manufacturing is not guided by any particular segment, but the overall demand side. There are a lot of other segments apart from grid-scale storage – like telecom, microgrids, UPS, DG offset, and small energy storage systems – that are showing significant demand. So there would be viability for setting up a big manufacturing capacity in the near future.
The government has launched the PLI scheme for advanced chemistry cell gigafabs. Between stationary energy storage and electric vehicle batteries, which application is more appealing for investment?
The recent announcement by the center on the much-awaited PLI scheme for the manufacturing of advanced chemistry cells (ACC) is a welcome move that will provide the necessary impetus to players in the sector.
The PLI scheme will help in setting up giga-scale factories, promoting exports, achieving economies of scale, and producing cutting-edge high-quality globally competitive products. Most importantly, it will help to create the next wave of job growth in the energy sector.
Additionally, as per the surveys this year, the market for stationary energy storage is higher than electric vehicles. Today, India is at a crucial stage in its transformative journey towards creating an e-mobility ecosystem, a stationary energy storage market, and a better renewable integration system.
Establishing domestic manufacturing capabilities is essential for the cost reduction of the product. Better manufacturing capabilities will be an essential enabler towards accelerating the adoption of electric mobility in the country.
Being associated with a market leader in the sector and with the capability we possess to design, manufacture, operate, and maintain large-scale energy storage system projects, PLI tender is definitely something we’re interested in.
We have our sights set on participating in as many opportunities as possible to maintain our market leadership position. However, when it comes to decisions about which tenders to participate in, it is always a strategic decision-making process and it depends on that particular tender, its economics, and the risk analysis involved.
Is the domestic ecosystem ripe enough to support the production of battery storage systems?
As we understand it, the ecosystem will develop in conjunction with consumption, and we are confident that the Indian manufacturing industry can become a part of the larger global battery energy storage market.
There is not much of a challenge as far as manufacturing is concerned although it’s going to require a sizeable effort from all stakeholders. It is just a matter of time until consumption sees an even greater uptick and the industry starts producing the components and materials that are essential for energy storage. We believe that it’s going to be a consumption-driven ecosystem.
Another bigger part of the puzzle is the supply chain competitiveness; with the introduction of the government’s PLI scheme, we are witnessing a sense of seriousness among stakeholders in enrolling for this. In a couple of years, India will have a significant cell manufacturing capacity to cater to a part of its demand.
There are a few components that would require an outrightly new ecosystem and we will have a dependency on the outside world at least for some time.
There are concerns about raw material availability for battery storage manufacturing. How can production costs be lowered to compete with cheaper products?
In India, we already have an ecosystem that can adapt itself to the requirements of energy storage. The electronic sector’s manufacturing abilities are a good example of a successful manufacturing story.
As far as the components are concerned, industries are operating at very good standards in terms of maintaining the quality that is required for the level of precision at fully automated plants such as ours. So the ecosystem already exists and will start working for battery manufacturers.
As we start manufacturing cells in India, the scale is going to be very important. It is good that the government is supporting the introduction of PLI. Until the time our domestic industry scales, the PLI scheme is a major incentive that the government is offering to the industry in terms of matching the cost-effectiveness to tackle China.
Secondly, we also have the manpower available to us at a better cost than in China. And even in terms of other infrastructure, we are developing fast and will be able to match up to China’s economy of scale within the next few years.
Which battery storage technology makes the most sense for Indian utility-scale battery storage projects?
The battery storage industry has been very dynamic over the last few years. However, there is hardly any technology apart from Li-ion which is ready for mass production. This is largely because the development of battery technologies leading to commercial production at scale takes fairly longer development cycles unlike any other electrical device or software that you can build, test, and then launch. It takes a reasonably long period for any chemical composition/chemical cells such as lithium-ion batteries to be tested and commercialized.
As for what technology makes the most sense for India, there are various applications, all with different technical requirements, and it cannot be any one particular technology that is going to serve the purpose.
However, currently, the only commercialized option which is ready to go and already moving into mass production is lithium-ion batteries. Therefore, for the time being, the energy storage ecosystem is going to be driven by lithium-ion batteries, until another technology can prove itself to be useful and viable for a specific application.
How do you see the Indian market evolve in the next three years, both in manufacturing and demand? 
Investments in manufacturing are linked to the demand and the market sentiment. If you have a good demand prediction that is bolstered by real demand coming in and if the sentiments about growth prospects are high, then the manufacturing sector will automatically develop without any policy intervention or any active incentives.
Demand is thus the most crucial element. I think the government has taken care of this and intervened positively to help India excel at manufacturing.
On the demand side, various sectors are actively trying to adopt energy storage for the first time; grid-scale storage is the most important segment here because energy security is paramount to fulfilling the economic objectives of this country. Also, when it comes to renewable integration, there is a huge scope for demand. India is very near to completing its target of 175 Gigawatt of renewable deployment, but we hardly have any storage deployed here. This is one area that could benefit immensely from energy storage because renewable energy production is intermittent and dependent on forces of nature.
Also, there are a lot of other segments where energy storage is already used like residential energy storage, telecom applications, etc. All these applications are going to experience a technology shift because of the better economy, and the performance and reliability of technologies in energy storage. The energy storage market thus has a bright future ahead that will be fueled by demand from a variety of sectors.
This copy was amended, at the request of Nexcharge, on 05/01/22 to remove reference in the lead intro of the story to the plans announced by the owners of the joint venture to set up lithium-ion cell production in India. Nexcharge told pv magazine: “Nexcharge has not made any exclusive announcement about Nexcharge foraying into … lithium ion cell manufacturing.” As reported by pv magazine, Exide Industries, the Indian company which owns 75% of Nexcharge, told the Bombay Stock Exchange on June 27, 2018, one of the reasons for setting up the JV with Leclanche was to establish “a cell manufacturing plant in the territory [of India].” A press release issued to accompany that stock market update said the cell plant was set to be operational in mid 2020.

The 100 MW, $196 million solar field, installed near the port of Mongla, will be the nation's largest to date and began a trial run of generating full load a week ago.
Withe the testing run producing “satisfactory” results, project manager Mehedi Islam Aneek said commercial operation will begin on Saturday or Sunday, depending on the weather.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for 2022 look even more promising.
The 280-acre site was developed by the Energon Renewables unit of Bangladeshi industrial conglomerate Orion Group which, in February 2019, secured a 20-year agreement from state body the Bangladesh Power Development Board to buy the electricity to be generated at the site for $0.138/kWh.
MM Ahsan Huda, Bangladesh country manager for Chinese solar manufacturer Longi, said the project features 250,000 Longi Solar Hi-MO5 panels.
Compatriot manufacturer Sungrow supplied the project's central inverter with the Singapore unit of Swiss electricals company ABB supplying the rest of the electrical equipment. Mumbai-based Mahindra Susten acted as the owner's engineer and project management consultant.
Original plans for a coal plant on the site were shelved because of its proximity to the Sundarbans. The world’s largest mangrove forest is a UNESCO World Heritage site.
With the Bangladeshi government aiming to use renewables to generate 40% of its electricity by 2041, and all of its power by mid century, it is estimated the Mongla project will take the country to 877.31 MW of clean power generation capacity.

The agency had recently inspected inverters and optimizers from eleven different PV power electronics suppliers. The inspections were carried out to check as to whether the equipment meet the country's electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements
The agency found that three companies were not in compliance with Sweden's current EMC rules. As a result, the manufacturers were banned from selling the products that were found to be in breach in the country.
The inspection was triggered by several reports received by the electrical safety agency, in which photovoltaic systems were said to have disrupted the radio communications of the police, aircraft, and the military.
The ban applies to Israel-based power electronics supplier SolarEdge for a number of its optimizers. Chinese manufacturer Growatt was also found to have fallen foul of the regulators, for its 8000TL3-S inverter series, which in Sweden are distributed by Sunnytek Solar Sweden AB, and a second company that has not been identified yet.
“There has been multiple news on SolarEdge optimizers that have shown to generate disturbance for an extended period of time,” Amelia Oller Westerberg, a PV market analyst at the consultancy Becquerel Sweden told pv magazine. ” The Swedish Electrical Safety Agency warned the company already in summer 2020 when it was still performing the study that is the basis for the decision.”
SolarEdge expressed surprise at the banning and claims that the complaints filed with the Electrical Safety Agency came from a handful of amateur radio operators.
“These incidents have been extremely limited and have been addressed and resolved without causing major issues,” a SolarEdge spokesperson told pv magazine. “We wish to clarify that all current SolarEdge products are tested, approved and compliant with EU regulations, including EN61000-6-3, the EU standard directly linked to the EMC Directive.”
According to the manufacturer, existing installations are not affected by the measure. “While we disagree with this announcement, and will challenge it, SolarEdge has already begun the transition to its next-generation Power Optimizers, including the newly released S440, S500, P850, P950 and P1100, all of which comply with EN61000-6-3 and EN55011, the EU standard for radio frequency disturbance characteristics,” the spokesperson added.
At the time of publication, Growatt had not responded to pv magazine enquiries on the matter. The Swedish Electrical Safety Agency has also not responded nor identified the third manufacturer affected by the banning.

The scheme is intended to deploy around 380 MW of solar capacity.
For PV systems ranging in size from six to 50 kW, the scheme will grant a Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff for surplus power injected into the grid and for 2022, the tariff was set at €0.135/kWh. “The CEP will be offered at a fixed rate for 15 years and eligible volumes will be capped at 80% of generation capacity, to encourage self-consumption,” the government said.
Projects not exceeding 6 kW in size will be offered a maximum rebate of €2,400 by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and will also be given the possibility of selling excess power to the grid.
“Support under the MSS will gradually reduce over time from 2024, to take account of reducing system costs,” the government further explained.
Eligible projects must have a minimum self-consumption rate of 70%. In order to support this high rate, the Irish government suggested the adoption of smart meters. “Smart meters can measure the profile of demand at the premises and thereby allow micro-generators to maximize their self-consumption,” it highlighted. “Smart meters can also measure the export of micro-generation installations to facilitate access to remuneration for residual electricity exported to the grid.”
The Irish government is currently supporting large scale PV through an auction scheme launched at the end of 2019. In the first procurement exercise – launched in April and finalized in August – the Irish authorities allocated 796 MW of solar generation capacity. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country had only 40 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2020.

“We have not yet made a public announcement of the location for either our first or second factory,” the company's CEO and founder Bates Marshall told pv magazine. “But we can disclose that both factories will be in the U.S., with the first located in California, and that proposed funding from the DoE is for the second factory. We can also share that the first factory will be able to deliver tens of millions of cells and the second facility will have roughly ten times the capacity of the first.”
The company has developed dye sensitized solar cells that are used by internet-of-things (IoT) and smart home device companies and can be manufactured in sizes from 5cm2 to 225cm2 and in arbitrary rectangular sizes to fit any device and satisfy different power requirements. 
“Ambient works with several of the largest smart home and IoT device manufacturers in the world, who use our products to improve the functionality and sustainability profiles of their products,” Marshall went on to say. “Since many of Ambient's customers will be debuting products in a few weeks at CES, which is an annual trade show organized by the U.S. Consumer Technology Association, we would like to not share any names at this time, out of respect for their upcoming announcements.”
The solar cells are claimed to eliminate the costs associated with replaceable batteries in consumer electronics, generate three times more power than amorphous silicon cells, and have a 90% higher conversion efficiency than other devices in low-light conditions. “Our selling price is competitive with high volume pricing per watt from conventional low-power commodity, Chinese-made, amorphous silicon indoor PV cells,” the CEO also explained.
Under illumination at 200 lux, the solar cell has a maximum power of 140 μW, an open-circuit voltage of 870 mV, and a short-circuit current of 200 μA. “Ambient's unique advantage is its extremely high power density – 15mW/cm² at 200 W linear, with respect to illumination of 25 to 1,000 lux, which is comparable performance to gallium arsenide and more than three times the performance of conventional amorphous silicon indoor PV cells,” Marshall emphasized, noting that the devices are able to deliver power across all types of illumination sources, including LED, fluorescent, incandescent and diffuse natural light.

The tenders were held on in the first two weeks of December.
In the first of the two auctions, solar accounted for around 570 MW at PLN207.85/MWh ($50.78) and for wind power it was PLN139.64/MW. The ERO had set a ceiling price of PLN320/MWh for solar projects and PLN250/MWh for wind. Approximately 14 TWh of electricity was contracted and around PLN3.2 billion was allocated. The ERO specified that when tariffs of the same value were received, the order in which they were lodged would be decisive, with the earliest offers successful. “This is the result of a large number of submitted offers,” it further explained.
In the second procurement exercise, all of the contracted capacity – around 300 MW – went to PV projects. The lowest bid came in at PLN219/MWh ($53.51) and the highest at PLN278.9/MWh. The ceiling price set by the Polish regulator was PLN340/MWh. Around PLN2.5 billion was allocated for the purchase of 2.7 TWh of energy.
In the last auction for projects over 1 MW, held in June, solar accounted for roughly 1.2 MW of the allocated power. Overall, the ERO allocated approximately 1.5 GW of renewable energy power generation capacity in the auction, including about 300 MW of wind power.
The last procurement exercise for projects not up to 1 MW in size also resulted in PV securing all the allocated capacity of 1 GW.
Poland has currently an installed PV capacity of more than 6.3 GW. The Polish PV market is expected to grow strongly during the current decade to reach 30 GW of installed capacity by the end of 2030, according to the Polish research institute Instytut Energetyki Odnawialnej (IEO).
The experts also expect the country's cumulative capacity to grow to 10 GW by the end of next year, despite an upcoming market contraction in the distributed generation segment. The upward trend for the solar sector in Poland will be maintained by the utility scale segment that, according to the forecast, will equal the installed capacity of the distributed generation segment at the turn of 2023-2024.

A research collaboration has led to the discovery of Edge Functionalized Graphene (EFG), a form of graphene which is both highly conductive and processable, and promises to improve the cost and efficiency of lithium-ion batteries.
Researchers at the University of Wollongong (UOW) in New South Wales, in collaboration with scientists from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science and the Australian National Fabrication Facility, made the discovery. They were led by Professor David Officer and Professor Gordon Wallace.
EFG is comprised of nano platelets with excellent potential as a valuable carbon additive for a variety of electrochemical devices, according to the researchers. The team said these unique properties mean that the materials will be useful in energy storage, both for batteries and supercapacitors, as well as in composites for use as sensors, reinforcement materials or non-metallic conductors.
The researchers are now working with private company Sicona Battery Technologies to demonstrate how to scale up production. Sicona has made binding agreements with UOW for the acquisition of its intellectual property related to EFG.
“Like many materials, finding a way to exploit the extraordinary properties of graphene in useful applications is critically dependent on making the graphene processable,” said Officer. “With EFG, we have been able to not only create a process that produces a unique graphene that can be used as a powder, dough, paste or dispersion, but a process that we believe is commercially scalable. Our commercial partners Sicona have recognized this.”
Sicona CEO Christiaan Jordaan said that the new material will enable it to improve its battery materials’ electrical conductivity, and therefore quality. “It’s a simple and highly scalable production process that yields this unique EFG material, we believe it has a bright future in the rapidly growing battery market,” he said.
EFG was initially discovered back in 2017, but researchers subsequently had to determine what the material “actually is” in order to simplify the manufacturing process, Wallace said.
“Taking amazing discoveries out of the research lab and into industry is a complex process. Often, we do not have common interests nor agree on the best way forward,” he added.
The technology is patent pending in 12 international jurisdictions. Its proponents said it will be “further enhanced” under a two-year research and collaboration agreement between Sicona and UOW focused on process scale-up and application of the graphene material in batteries, as well as a thermal conductivity enhancer.

Lockheed Martin has revealed plans to supply its GridStar Flow battery technology to TC Energy’s Saddlebrook Solar + Storage Project, which is set to be constructed in Alberta, Canada.
The Saddlebrook Solar + Storage Project will consist of a 102.5 MW solar facility using bifacial modules, paired with a GridStar Flow battery energy storage system that will be up to 6.5 MW/52 MWh in capacity. The pilot project is expected to be the largest flow battery energy storage facility in Alberta and will aid the region’s sustainability and decarbonization efforts.
Flow batteries are electrochemical storage devices that use reusable, externally stored electrolytes. They are generally less expensive, safer, more flexible and adaptable compared to lithium-ion tech, and can discharge their electricity over a longer duration – in this instance, up to eight hours.
The first phase of the project, which involves the solar installation, is expected to begin construction in the second quarter of 2022,. It is set to reach commercial operation in the fourth quarter of 2022. The battery system is expected to follow just over a year later, commencing installation in the third quarter of 2023 and achieving operation in the first quarter of 2024.
The installation will also be the subject of research, conducted by the University of Calgary, Lockheed Martin, and TC Energy, to demonstrate the effectiveness of a large-scale solar plus storage generation facility and inform similar sustainable energy projects across Canada.
Alberta has become Canada’s solar hotbed. Westbridge Energy Corp. recently acquired a 75% controlling interest in Sunnynook Solar Energy, a company developing a 236 MW solar and 100 MW battery energy storage system (BESS) project in Alberta. Westbridge Energy has also initiated two BESS projects in Alberta, set to total 200 MW in capacity, and the 230 MW Georgetown Solar Project.
Lockheed Martin is also investing $9 million (USD) in the development and construction of the Saddlebrook Solar + Storage Project. The investment is associated with Canada’s purchase and in-service support of 17 CC-130J Super Hercules aircraft, delivered to the Royal Canadian Air Force from 2010 through 2012.
The Canadian Renewable Energy Association expects close to 2 GW of wind and solar projects to begin construction or complete installation before the end of this year.

The US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) oversees nearly 250 million acres of land, mostly in the western half of the country. In 2012, the BLM worked with the Obama administration to flag potential sites in the western United States to develop large-scale, federally managed solar. It identified 1,400 square miles of public land, which could support 100 GW of solar.
That figure would nearly double the installed capacity of the United States. That said, only a minute amount of solar PV infrastructure is federally managed for the public.
However, this might soon change, as BLM is working with the Biden administration to revive some of the Obama-era investigations into such projects. This week, BLM held a call to nominate land for solar development across Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico, with a combined area of 140 square miles. The agency’s director, Tracy Stone-Manning, said that officials are actively evaluating 40 large-scale projects on identified public land.
Progress has already begun on this front, as BLM has approved the construction of the Arica and Victory Pass solar projects in California. The two sites have a planned combined capacity of 465 MW of solar and 400 MW of battery energy storage. The projects represent a $689 million investment and an estimated $5.9 million in annual operational economic benefit.
Clearway Energy Group is set to construct, operate, maintain and decommission the two facilities. The projects will be developed as part of the BLM’s Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan, which seeks to conserve desert ecosystems and recreational areas, while expanding decarbonized energy in California.
State officials have said that the further approval of the 500 MW Oberon project in California is expected in the days ahead.
