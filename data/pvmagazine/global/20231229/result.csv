In 2023, that growth continued, though more modestly than some years past. Wood Mackenzie reported a 24% growth in installations through the first three quarters of 2023. Supply chain constraints of 2022 eased, and California had a big surge in installations from customers looking to secure legacy NEM 2.0 rates. Below are four rooftop solar trends that pv magazine USA reported this year.
The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates to highs not seen in many years in an attempt to stamp down sharply rising inflation. This was a particular challenge to rooftop solar, as many companies rely on loans to provide solar equipment to their customers.
High interest rates put pressure on solar financiers to either raise interest rates on loans or assess upfront dealer fees. In both cases, these changes squeezed the value offered to customers, leading to a tough year for solar company stock valuations and a slowdown in installations.
Though financing a solar project has gotten more expensive, so too have utility rates, placing another factor in the “why you should go solar” bucket. In California, electricity rates have exploded over the past three years, far outpacing inflation. Another 13% utility rate hike is pegged for California in 2024.
This has led to a shift in thinking about the benefit of solar plus storage. While customers often focus on payback periods or return on investment (ROI), this can be exceedingly difficult to calculate under shifting assumptions of utility electric rates.
Instead, solar installers are focusing the discussion on solar plus batteries being a hedge against unpredictable electricity rates, which have continued to rise sharply nationwide. While solar and storage shoppers typically use a rule of thumb of about 3% to 4% annual rate increases from the utility company to estimate long-term savings, double-digit rate hikes are common now. Where will your electric rate be in 25 years?
There have been numerous policy changes across the US, many of which have cut the value of net metering, or the process by which solar customers export excess solar generation to the grid in exchange for credits.
Net metering has been critical in launching US rooftop solar, and while net metered solar rates need to account for the utility’s cost to operate transmission lines, solar advocates argue that cuts to net metered rates went down far too much, far too fast.
This prime example of this is in California, where the sudden slash of about 80% of net metering value led to an 80% drop in installations in the following months. The California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) said over 17,000 jobs have been lost as a result.
Rooftop solar is evolving. In many markets across the US, with net metering being actively being phased out, standalone solar arrays cannot capture the same value as they had in the past.
Home battery energy storage systems are increasingly being attached with rooftop solar to ensure homeowners can store and consume their locally produced clean energy, avoiding peak demand charges that occur in the afternoon.
However, solar-plus-battery systems can do more than just store and self-consume power in a day-to-night cycle. These distributed energy resources can work in concert, along with HVAC systems and home appliances, to smooth out demand across the grid, creating more stability in electricity markets, and eliminating the supply and demand imbalance phenomenon known as the “duck curve.”
Programs that coordinate these distributed resources are often referred to as virtual power plants (VPP). By participating in a VPP, rooftop solar and battery customers can leverage their resources and get paid by a VPP administrator.
In California, customers are paid up to $100 to $250 annually for enrolling their batteries in PG&E demand response programs. In Long Island, New York, PSEG customers are paid up to $6,250 upfront for enabling their battery to be leveraged by the utility during ten peak demand events throughout the year.
In 2024, some of the heavy headwinds like high interest rates are expected to partially subside. Manufacturers and distributors will attempt to clear out excess channel inventories created by the dip in demand.
“I feel that 2024 will be a year of recovery,” said Raghu Belur, co-founder and chief of products at Enphase Energy in an interview with pv magazine USA. “I don’t see the market getting worse, but I don’t see it getting dramatically better. We won’t be back to the 2022-type growth. That will probably take an extra year. But 2024 you see things starting to turn around and slowly recover.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/29/iberdrola-to-install-spains-first-hybrid-hydroelectric-solar-plant/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE,SPAIN,WESTERN EUROPE",EDGAR MEZA,"DECEMBER 29, 2023",Iberdrola to install Spain’s first hybrid hydroelectric-solar plant,"Iberdrola España has obtained environmental approval for Spain's first hybrid PV-hydroelectric plant.
The Hidro Cedillo project, located in the community of Extremadura, will have a capacity of 86.4 MW, employing more than 160,000 PV modules and a fixed structure.
“Hybridization allows optimizing the use of the grid and minimizing the environmental impact of projects in the locations where they are located,” Iberdrola stated. “By having two technologies capable of alternating, dependence on changing environmental conditions and limitations due to possible lack of resources such as wind or sunshine is significantly reduced, facilitating more stable and efficient renewable production.”
The company, which recently announced that it would also build Spain's first hybrid wind-solar plant in Burgos, plans further investments in this technology in the coming years with the aim of improving Spain's renewable resources and making the most of existing locations.
Hybrid generation plants use the same grid connection point and share infrastructures, such as the substation and the evacuation line for the electricity produced. In addition, they are located on land that is already in use for renewable generation and allows for common roads and facilities for the operation of both technologies. “All of this results in a much lower environmental impact than two independent plants, which reinforces Iberdrola España's innovative and renewable leadership in Spain,” the company noted.
The project will also undertake a series of measures aimed at protecting the environment and improving biodiversity in the surrounding area. These include two additional pools or water points that will be built to facilitate the availability of water in the different sections of the plant. The construction of a watering trough for livestock and a system of naturalized ponds for surrounding wildlife are also envisaged. The company likewise plans to mark the exclusion zones that protect river courses, ponds, unique vegetation, trees and habitats of interest around the large pond in the area. It has also outlined a number of measures to protect reptiles, amphibians, birds and bats.
Extremadura has become one of Iberdrola's growth regions in Spain, with nearly 5.2 GW installed, 4.1 of which are renewable, including hydroelectric, solar and battery stations. The company's solar PV activities in the region include the  Cedillo (375 MW), Majada Alta (50 MW), San Antonio (50 MW) and Almaraz I and II plants (80 MW).
In Cedillo, Iberdrola has established the first solar community for an entire village, which provides residents and traders who are members of the solar community with savings of 50% of their consumption through a self-consumption system. This solar community has just been recognized as the best sustainability initiative in Europe with SolarPower Europe's Solar Sustainability Award 2023, presented in Brussels in early December.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/29/solar-module-prices-in-india-likely-to-remain-subdued-in-the-near-term/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,ASIA,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 29, 2023",Solar module prices in India ‘likely to remain subdued in the near term’,"From pv magazine India
The prices of the imported mono PERC modules (before duty and logistics) witnessed a significant decline over the past 15 months, declining to an all-time low of 12-13 cents/watt in December 2023 from the high of 27-28 cents/watt seen in Q4 FY2022 and lower than the 23-24 cents/watt seen in December 2022. Also, cell prices have declined to 5-6 cents/watt in December 2023 from the peak of 16-17 cents/watt in December 2022.
Based on the prevailing cell and module prices, the landed cost of imported modules is expected to be about 19-20 cents/watt, while the cost of modules sourced from domestic OEMs using imported cells is expected to be higher at 22-23 cents/watt.
The imports of solar cells and modules increased by 155% to INR 22,992 crore ($2.8 million) in 7M FY2024 from INR 9,020 crore in 7M FY2023, in view of the abeyance of the ALMM order and a sharp decline in solar PV cell and module prices. While the domestic OEMs are expected to be protected against imports through the ALMM post March 31, 2024 (assuming that the abeyance is not extended), the pricing would remain exposed to global wafer and cell prices given the dependence on imports for key inputs. The Indian solar OEMs can improve their competitiveness through backward integration and increasing the scale of operations.
Given the dominance of Chinese OEMs across the solar PV manufacturing value chain, the pricing would remain sensitive to the supply coming from China along with their capacity expansion plans. In the near term, the prices are likely to remain subdued.
The plans by the Indian manufacturers would remain linked with the protection available against the cheaper imports, i.e., ALMM and BCD regime. If the ALMM order were to be restored post March 2024, the domestic manufacturers are likely to continue with their expansion plans. However, the manufacturers should focus on backward integration, technology adoption and scaling up their capacities to compete with the global manufacturers.
Given that the manufacturing capacity in India is likely to exceed the domestic demand if all the capacity expansion plans, including under the PLI scheme, were to fructify, the ability of the Indian solar OEMs to remain competitive with the global peers would be important to achieve a respective share in the export markets.

The company, which specializes in developing, operating and acquiring interests in power facilities on the African continent, purchased a 52.5% stake in Mocuba from Norway's Scatec and a 22.5% share from fellow Norwegian group KLP Norfund. Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM), the country's national power company, continues to hold the remaining 25% stake in the plant.
The acquisition significantly expands Globeleq’s renewable energy footprint in Mozambique and comes just weeks after the company began commercial operations of its 19 MW solar and 7 MWh energy storage project in Cuamba. Globeleq said Mocuba also represented an important addition to its solar PV portfolio in Africa, which now has capacity of close to 400 MW across South Africa, Egypt, Kenya and Mozambique.
In addition to Mocuba, the company is constructing a major 450 MW gas-to-power project in Temane that will substantially expand the Mozambican national grid when it starts to produce power at the end of 2024, providing vital baseload power to support and enable additional renewable power projects.
At the same time, the Temane Transmission Project is constructing a 563 km, 400 kV transmission line that will provide a vital link to the southern section of the Mozambican national grid. Globeleq is likewise advancing its 120 MW wind project at Namaacha, near Maputo, which is expected to reach financial close in 2024.
“We are steadily building a major business in Mozambique in solar, wind and gas-to-power of which this acquisition at Mocuba is just the latest addition,” said Globeleq CEO Mike Scholey. “Mocuba is an excellent fit within our pan-African solar portfolio and I welcome our new colleagues from the plant to Globeleq. 2024 promises to be a critical year for Globeleq in Mozambique as the Temane gas-to-power plant moves towards commercial operations and the Namaacha project, the country’s first wind power project, is expected to reach financial close by mid-2024.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/29/gdi-launches-100-silicon-anode-enabling-rapid-charging-higher-energy-density/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"DECEMBER 29, 2023","GDI unveils 100% silicon anode for rapid charging, higher energy density","In recent years, the quest for next-generation, high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries led to anodes with more silicon in place of commonly used graphite. That is due to the abundant, non-toxic material’s theoretical capacity of 3,600 mAh/g, compared to graphite’s maximum of 372 mAh/g.
The latest company to report significant progress in silicon anode development is US-based GDI. The company has launched a 100% silicon, “roll-to-roll” processed anode and has announced third-party safety testing results.
According to GDI, its silicon anode has shown over 3,200 mAh/g in third-party testing, which allows for more than 30% energy density than graphite anodes, enabling repeated 15-minute fast charging for hundreds of times, back to back.
While the perks of fast charging, safety and high energy are difficult to get simultaneously in today’s lithium-ion batteries, GDI says that its technology allows for all three as a result of its silicon architecture, bonded directly to copper alloy foil made by Germany-based Carl Schlenk AG.
“The next step is to show our anode can enable EV batteries that power vehicles with more than 500 miles of range, allows them to charge 250 miles in 15 minutes, hundreds of times, and improves safety,” said GDI CEO Rob Anstey. “Our mission at GDI is to deliver a complete 100% silicon anode that can be integrated into existing battery production, greatly reduces GHG emissions from the anode production, and scales rapidly on cutting-edge industrial equipment.”
GDI has worked in partnership with AGC, a Japan-based glass and plasma coating technology specialist, to demonstrate the MWh scale of its roll-to-roll production using AGC’s modified glass coating equipment. The anode specialist has shown that its finished product can be dropped directly into existing cell production lines, avoiding numerous steps and cutting costs.
“GDI and AGC have developed a clear roadmap to gigawatt-scale production by 2028, so that this technology can used in tens of thousands of high-performance vehicles by 2030,” Anstey said.
GDI calculates that its advanced production method reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 80% compared to graphite anodes.
The company has also announced third-party testing results showing that battery cells featuring GDI’s silicon anode are “far more resistant to thermal runaway than the current state of the art high energy EV cells on the market.”
The 3.5Ah pouch cells were made by US-based Navitas with an energy density of more than 250Wh/kg and featuring a standard liquid electrolyte. After leaving a nail pierced through Navita's cell with a GDI anode for 10 hours, there was no fire, no smoke, and temperatures only increased by 10 C.
Moreover, the cell was able to pass nail penetration testing, even with commercial off-the-shelf liquid electrolytes, and a high nickel cathode, only heating up to 30 C, said the company.
GDI is based in New York, with a European R&D center and pilot production facility in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. It is currently setting up its first MWh-scale roll-to-roll production facility in Lauenförde, Germany. The company is backed by venture capitalists, industry experts, government bodies, EIT InnoEnergy, and strategic investors.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/29/pv-driven-liquid-air-storage-system-design-for-applications-in-buildings/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 29, 2023",PV-driven liquid air storage system for buildings,"A research group led by the Sichuan Normal University in China has developed a photovoltaic-driven LAES system to supply power, cooling, and heating in buildings.
LAES systems, designed for large-scale applications, store electricity in the form of liquid air or nitrogen at cryogenic temperatures below -150 C. They charge by using excess electricity to power compression and liquefaction of the air, stored as a liquid at temperatures approaching -196 C. To discharge, the liquid air warms and becomes a pressurized gas that operates a turbine to generate electricity.
The scientists said the system would be powered by surplus PV electricity and to work in three phases – compression, liquefaction, and expansion.
“The excess photovoltaic power is sent to the LAES unit for air compression and liquefaction, and the electric energy is converted into the air energy for storage,” they explained, noting that grid electricity could also be used to recharge the system when PV power is not available. “When the output power from the PV system is not enough to meet the building's electricity demand, the LAES unit releases the stored liquid air into the expansion process to convert the air energy into electric energy.”
The system relies on a high-temperature thermal oil tank to store compression heat. This may then be used to generate cold energy via an absorption refrigerator or to recover heat that could then be used for a portion of a building's thermal energy demand.
“Finally, the liquid air is reduced to atmospheric pressure and −194.26 C at low temperatures after passing through the cryo-turbine, and stored in a liquid air tank,” the academics said. “Among them, the un-liquefied air is fed back into the cold box to release cold energy and mix with a certain amount of ambient air for the next round of recompression in the air compressor.”
The research group conducted a series of simulations via the HYSYS software. The assumed system was a building equipped with a 411 kW PV system in Jinan, Shandong province, China.
They found that the PV-LAES system could produce 523.93 MWh of electricity, 57.75 GJ of cold energy, and 119.24 GJ of heat energy annually. The system also exhibited round-trip efficiency of up to 67.05%. It was also found to be able to meet 89.72% of the building's power demand, 51.96% of the heating demand, and 11% of the cooling demand.
“The economic evaluation indicates that the static payback period (SPP) and dynamic payback period (DPP) are stable at 5.37 years and 6.45 years, respectively, with an investment return rate (IRR) of 17.94% and a return of investment (ROI) of 18.62%,” the research group said. “The PV-LAES can reduce the grid power consumption by 523.93 MWh per year, equivalent to a reduction of 359.34 tons of CO2 emissions.”
They introduced the system in “Photovoltaic-driven liquid air energy storage system for combined cooling, heating and power towards zero-energy buildings,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management.
In March, the research group published a study presenting a techno-economic analysis of the proposed system. The investment payback period could be within 10 years and the accumulated net profit can reach up to $2.2 million.
“The proposed PV-LAES scheme is economically feasible from a life-cycle perspective, and can potentially realize flexible energy interaction with local renewables to achieve an integrated low-carbon power generation and storage system,” the researchers said at the time.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/29/assessing-impact-of-topography-induced-shading-on-floating-pv/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,TURKEY,WORLD",BERNADETTE GEYER,"DECEMBER 29, 2023",Topography-induced shading on floating PV,"Turkish researchers have developed a novel approach to deploy floating PV (FPV) systems at the Ayvalı hydroelectric power plant (HPP) in Erzurum province, Turkey. The proposed method considers the minimum water surface area and the topography-induced shading effect on the water at various levels in a reservoir.
“This study distinguishes itself from previous research by considering horizontal and vertical variations on the dam surface, particularly considering the shading effect,” the scientists explained. “This study emphasizes the importance of utilizing suitable locations on water surfaces for FPV systems, similar to marginal lands and rooftops, through the use of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques.”
To determine the shading effect on the reservoir, the team used RS and GIS to calculate monthly global horizontal irradiance (GHI) values on the water surface from 2017-21. Next, the team produced new digital elevation model (DEM) maps by overlapping water height changes with Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) PALSAR data. After analyzing these maps, the researchers classified pixels in regions on the surface as having annual electricity production potential that was very high, high, moderate, low, and very low.
“The results revealed that 1083.45 GWh of electricity can be produced annually by installing FPV in very high and high potential areas,” the academics said. “However, as the moderate, low, and very low regions represent only 5.02% of the reservoir surface and there is a 1.68-fold difference in production potential between the highest and lowest areas due to topography-induced shading near the coastline, it was concluded that FPV installation would not be efficient in those regions.”
The researchers said the findings underscore the importance of considering shading caused by the topography along the shore of the reservoir.
The team determined the minimum reservoir surface area for the Ayvalı dam as 504.69 hectares by using 60 Sentinel-2 satellite images, machine learning algorithms on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, support vector machines (SVM), and the automatic water extraction index (AWEI). It proposed that in reservoirs where shaded areas constantly shift due to water height changes – such as dams – the shading should be taken into account and the minimum water surface area should be considered for the FPV installation.
They presented their findings in “A novel approach suggestion for assessing the impact of topographic shading on the estimation of the floating photovoltaic technical potential,” which was recently published in Energy.
“Considering the differences in electricity generation potential among regions, the installation of FPV systems should be avoided in very low and low potential areas,” the team concluded. “This study highlights the necessity of considering the shading effect on water surfaces and emphasizes the usefulness of RS and GIS techniques for this purpose.”

The Solixon A-22 simulator is designed for a wide range of PV technologies, including thin-film and perovskite solar cells.
The research-sized, steady-state system has a sample illuminated area that measures 22 cm x 22 cm and a light intensity range of 200 W/m2 to 1,100 W/m2. Below 200 W/m2, the system requires an optional filter. It has spectrum coverage of 280 nanometers (nm) to 3,000 nm and is configurable from Class A+ to Class AAA.
The manufacturer claims a light emitter lifetime of greater than 20,000 hours. It measures 350 mm x 350 mm and it weighs 45 kg.
“The Solixon A-22’s continuous illumination feature makes it especially well-suited for testing thin film and third generation solar cells,” Lumartix CEO Laurent Calame told pv magazine.
He said that larger versions of the Solixon solar simulators are already in use by PV industry groups, such as PV manufacturers Hanwha Qcells and First Solar, and TÜV, a German technical inspection provider, along with universities and testing institutes.
The Solixon equipment is based on the Lumartix plasma light engine, an alternative to conventional Xenon arc lamp technology, and purportedly requires lower maintenance. It is equipped with a radio frequency control system and electrode-free technology.
“It has no extra parts or filters, mercury-free, and no spectral shift,” said Calame.
The Solixon A-22 can be used with monocrystalline cells, multi-junction silicon solar cells, thin film, organic, perovskite, and dye-sensitized solar cells in a range of relevant tests, such as maximum power determination (MPP), measurement of temperature coefficient, low irradiance, light soaking, as well as characterization and stabilization tests.
Software to support data acquisition and remote access is pre-installed. The equipment is certified to PV industry standards, such as IEC 60904-9:2020 ed. 3, ASTM E927-05, and JIS C 8912 standards, as well as relevant military and automotive industry standards.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/29/tasman-high-pressure-stalls-el-ninos-expected-solar-boost-on-australian-east-coast/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",,"DECEMBER 29, 2023",High pressure stalls El Nino’s expected solar boost in eastern Australia,"Despite the developing El Nino, eastern Australia’s behind-the-meter normalized generation is down 10% to 15% compared to last year. This development is a result due to a wet and cloudy end to spring, which countered the typical drier, sunny conditions associated with El Nino.

Using the Solcast API to model behind-the-meter generation at thousands of points, recent data analysis shows how November 2023 rooftop solar performed across the country, compared to 2022.

Most solar assets on Australia's east coast underperformed due to cloudier conditions through November. In New South Wales, behind-the-meter normalized generation fell 15% from 2022. Queensland experienced a smaller decrease of about 10%.
These reductions were largely due to persistent high pressure in the Tasman Sea, which directed north-easterly winds into eastern Australia, leading to a more moist and unstable air mass. As a result, November experienced increased storm activity and cloudiness, particularly affecting coastal areas where the majority of residential and commercial-industrial solar systems are located.
In contrast, Victoria experienced a 10% increase in November's year-on-year normalized behind-the-meter generation. This was primarily due to the same high-pressure system in the Tasman Sea suppressing surface cold fronts that affect the west of the state. Cold fronts usually bring south-westerly winds and a cool, moist air mass from the Southern Ocean to western Victoria.
However, their suppression this year led to sunnier conditions, particularly in the west, which includes Melbourne – a high residential PV-density population center. Despite the eastern part of Victoria experiencing about 10% lower irradiance similar to the rest of the east coast, the sunnier west compensated for this in terms of behind-the-meter generation.
Despite its large area, behind-the-meter PV in Australia is highly concentrated due to its highly urbanized and densely populated regions. Australia has the highest per-capita PV installed capacity in the world, growing at a rate of more than 10% annually. Recent data from SunWiz shows that over 330 MW of new rooftop solar systems were installed in November 2023, the largest month for rooftop solar installations ever seen in Australia.
Australia’s high concentration of solar power presents challenges in managing uncertainty in behind-the-meter generation and underlying demand. In multiple states, daytime peaks of rooftop solar generation are pushing demand below base load generation from coal. Accurate solar data and forecasting, like has been used in this analysis, are critical in addressing these challenges, ensuring efficient grid operation and maximizing the benefits of solar energy.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This information is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets throughout the world.

This has been maintained in all conventional operation scenarios for quantum batteries, which could surpass the usefulness of conventional chemical batteries in some low-power applications.
Now, for the first time, researchers led by the University of Tokyo, have taken a step further to charge quantum batteries in an indefinite causal order (ICO).
In the classical realm, causality follows a clear path, meaning that if “event A” leads to “event B,” then the possibility of B causing A is excluded. However, at the quantum scale, ICO allows both directions of causality to exist in what’s known as a quantum superposition, where both can be simultaneously true.
“With ICO, we demonstrated that the way you charge a battery made up of quantum particles could drastically impact its performance,” said graduate student Yuanbo Chen. “We saw huge gains in both the energy stored in the system and the thermal efficiency. And somewhat counterintuitively, we discovered the surprising effect of an interaction that’s the inverse of what you might expect. A lower-power charger could provide higher energies with greater efficiency than a comparably higher-power charger using the same apparatus.”

The research team has proposed a nonunitary dynamics-based charging protocol and experimentally investigated this using a photonic quantum switch. They have experimented with ways to charge a quantum battery using optical apparatuses such as lasers, lenses, and mirrors to find the best ways to charge quantum batteries. They have found that the ICO protocol can outperform the conventional protocols and give rise to the anomalous inverse interaction effect.
They said that the phenomenon of ICO could find uses beyond charging a new generation of low-power devices. The underlying principles, including the inverse interaction effect uncovered here, could improve the performance of other tasks involving thermodynamics or processes that involve the transfer of heat. One promising example is solar panels, where heat effects can reduce their efficiency, but ICO could be used to mitigate those and lead to gains in efficiency instead.
Presently, quantum batteries only exist as laboratory experiments. One of the advantages of quantum batteries is that they should be incredibly efficient, but that hinges on the way they are charged, as further proved in this study.
“Current batteries for low-power devices, such as smartphones or sensors, typically use chemicals such as lithium to store charge, whereas a quantum battery uses microscopic particles like arrays of atoms,” said Chen. “While chemical batteries are governed by classical laws of physics, microscopic particles are quantum in nature, so we have a chance to explore ways of using them that bend or even break our intuitive notions of what takes place at small scales. I’m particularly interested in the way quantum particles can work to violate one of our most fundamental experiences, that of time.”
The researchers presented their findings in the study “Charging Quantum Batteries via Indefinite Causal Order: Theory and Experiment,” which was recently published in Physical Review Letters.

The team fabricated inverted cells using q 2D MXenes material in the zinc oxide (ZnO) electron transport layers (ETL). MXenes compounds take their name from their graphene-like morphology and are made via selective etching of certain atomic layers from a bulk crystal known as MAX.
MXenes materials have shown promise for use in PV technology due to their unique optoelectronic properties, such as their large charge carrier mobility, excellent metallic conductivity, high optical transmittance, and tunable work function (WF).
“The 2D Mxenes provides unique possibilities for these research directions, which we show in this research work by combining fundamental studies, also synchrotron-based, on interface properties, with device development and lifetime testing,” Morten Madsen, the paper’s corresponding author, told pv magazine.
“The process for the coating of the 2D MXenes-based electron transport layers is fully scalable and the use of only nonhalogenated solvents is also an important point here,” explained Madsen, noting that the interface defect passivation promotes significantly prolonged OPV device lifetime without hampering initial performance.
The scientists used an MXenes material known as titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx), which has tunable optical and electronic properties, into ZnO precursors in inverter organic PV cells using the PM6:N3 donor polymer as the absorber. They also used a halogen-free solvent as an active layer solvent, due to its lack of toxic substances.
The group produced an organic cell with a 0.5% weight percent (wt) of MXenes and a second device with a 2% wt. The first achieved a power conversion efficiency of 14.1% and the second of 13.7%. The latter, however, showed superior stability. 
The researchers acknowledged a trade-off of a slightly reduced efficiency in return for more stable devices with “superior” lifetimes. For example, devices with 2 wt % MXene in the ZnO layer had an overall accumulated lifetime power generation of almost three times more than the reference devices.
Stabilization is attributed to the passivation of photocatalytic degradation in ZnO. The group hypothesized that “a more perfect coverage of the 2D MXene layer across the full devices” will improve the device performance and the stabilization effect for the MXenes-based cells even further. The team sees MXenes use as a “more generic route for stabilization of interfaces to various active layer components in organic photovoltaics.”
The scientists presented their findings in “2D MXene-Based Electron Transport Layers for Nonhalogenated Solvent-Processed Stable Organic Solar Cells,” which was recently published in ACS Applied Energy Materials.
Madsen’s team is now looking at module coatings in thin-film sheet (S2S) and roll-to-roll (R2R) foils.
“We currently work on transferring the new interlayers, for example, MXene based interlayers, to S2S and R2R, and from that demonstrate improved performance and lifetime for sustainable and scalable OPV modules,” he said.
The research team includes academics from University of Southern Denmark’s CAPE Center for Advanced Photovoltaics and Thin-film Energy Devices, Sorbonne Université and Université Grenoble Alpes CNRS, both in France, along with Swedish researchers from Uppsala University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and two groups in Italy at the Institute of Structure of Matter (ISM) and University of Rome Tor Vergata.
