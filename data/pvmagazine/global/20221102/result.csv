It is being installed in the municipality of Talnique, La Libertad department. It will have an installed capacity of 17 MW, with operations expected to start in December 2023.
The Talnique project will host 29,600 bifacial solar modules from an undisclosed manufacturer. The electricity generated will be sold to the wholesale electricity market through a long-term public power purchase agreement (PPA), according to local media.
The solar park required a public investment of $20 million and will be executed by the country’s energy supplier Inversiones Energéticas, a CEL subsidiary. It which will generate electricity to power around 25,000 Salvadorean households.  The construction phase of the project will generate 100 direct and 300 indirect jobs.
“We are very proud to announce this good news, because for the first time in the history of our country, the state creates, designs, plans and executes a solar project,” said Daniel Alvarez, president of CEL.
El Salvador had a total solar installed capacity of 478 MW in 2021, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/02/europes-latest-u-turn-could-threaten-renewables-investment/,"GEOPOLITICS,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,EUROPE",BLAKE MATICH,"NOVEMBER 2, 2022",Europe’s latest U-turn could threaten renewables investment,"Europe's lengthy and controversial debate over whether or not to place a cap on gas prices shows no signs of finding a swift solution.
The EU grudgingly accepted the decision of Spain and Portugal in April to opt for a €40 ($39.63)/MWh price gap on gas used for electricity generation. However, the European Commission itself continues to vacillate.
EC President Ursula von der Leyen put her support behind a price cap on gas as a “temporary solution” in October. However, another U-turn revealed itself in a “non-paper” circulated by Brussels in late October.
This “Non-Paper – Policy Options to Mitigate the Impact of Natural Gas Prices on Electricity Bills” instead argues for a decoupling of electricity prices from gas prices, and suggests that a price cap on gas would increase already stressed demand.
“In the current context, such an increase would risk worsening the already difficult situation,” the non-paper said.
This decoupling would see a system of tenders and long-term contracts for producers of renewable and nuclear energy. The non-paper says the price of these contracts would be determined from the production costs of the technologies themselves. This system, the EC seems to think, will be supported by a short-term market for gas-fired power. Hence the hesitation to follow the “Iberian” method and set a price cap on gas.
The non-paper also warned that the impact of such a price gap would be disproportionate across EU member states. It argues those states most reliant on gas-fired power generation would face the highest costs for the subsidy, noting Germany, the Netherlands and Italy in particular.
On the other hand, states with comparatively less reliance on gas-fired power stations, notably France, would be the “biggest net beneficiary.”
A possible solution would be a scheme to redistribute the costs of the price cap amongst member states, but if a decision can't be made about the policy itself, one finds it hard to believe such a complicated scheme could be worked out any time soon.
SolarPower Europe has not taken kindly to this latest EC U-turn. In a statement, the industry body asked European Council President Charles Michel and EC President von der Leyen for “Quality and transparent decision-making with respect to long-term electricity market reform.”
SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger said she understands the delicate complexity of the situation. However, she argues that it is “essential to keep the focus on the origins of the problem and tackle the root cause of the crisis: Europe's reliance on imported fossil fuels.”
Hemetsberger expressed grave concerns about the policy direction shown in the “non-paper” and makes it clear that the real problem is a “lack of sufficient investments in renewable energies. The only structural solution to this crisis is a massive and accelerated deployment of renewables and their efficient integration via storage or demand side response.”
A particular point of ire was “the suggestions to move all new inframarginal technologies (particularly solar and wind) outside of the market and into mandatory Contracts for Difference (CfDs).” The SolarPower Europe CEO argues such a move would “constitute a complete U-turn” from years of progressively exposing renewables to the market.
Hemetsberger added that, while CfDs have been, and still are, very beneficial to drive the deployment of renewables, a move in this direction would only mean a return to central planning, auctions, and would potentially stifle investment.
Not only does Hemetsberger dismiss the merits of the arguments made in the “non-paper,” but suggests the “non-paper” itself is nothing more than a poorly timed distraction. “Changing the rules of electricity markets overnight, or even just feeding the debate with non-papers, has a chilling effect on investments and will slow down the energy transition.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/02/longi-launches-all-new-back-contact-module-promising-22-8-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 2, 2022","Longi launches all new back contact module, promising 22.8% efficiency","Longi Solar has launched a brand new module series, and introduced a ‘hybrid passivated back contact’ cell technology. The new Hi-MO 6 series will initially run in four different formats primarily targeting rooftop and distributed generation projects, and includes products supplied with integrated module-level power electronics. The series will also be available in a range of colors suited to BIPV applications.
In solar manufacturing, 2022 has largely been defined by manufacturers either switching to heterojunction (HJT) technology, or upgrading their existing PERC capacity to produce tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells. By moving to produce back-contact technology, Longi is aiming at even higher efficiency, albeit with a less-established technology that’s still thought to have huge potential.
Datasheets for the new product range promise module efficiencies of up to 22.3%. Additionally, Longi expects to be able to achieve a maximum of 22.8% in manufacturing. And with its new cell technology, the company also expects to gain many of the advantages seen with TOPCon and HJT.
“Modules equipped with HPBC cell technology can generate a greater volume of energy under high-temperature and low-irradiation conditions, and also have superior power degradation performance,” the company stated. Longi added that its simulations show an average yield increase of up to 10% compared to PERC in typical installation scenarios.
With Hi-MO 6, Longi is sticking with the 182mm cell format that it introduced a few years back. The modules will be offered in 54, 60, 66 and 72 cell formats, with power ratings between 410 W and 575 W.
Alongside the new cell technology, Longi is introducing several other module innovations likely to appeal to customers in the rooftop/distributed segment. One module in the series named ‘Guardian’ is to be supplied with built in module-level power electronics, in the form of Longi’s smart optimizer. This allows for flexible system design, real time monitoring and optimization, and rapid shutdown capability – increasingly a requirement in many rooftop markets.
Another module in the series, marketed under the name ‘Artist’ will be available in various colors and highly customizable to suit building-integrated projects. Back-contact technology itself promises improved aesthetics, since the modules can be designed with minimal gaps between cells and no busbars, making for a smoother appearance.
The series is rounded out by two more products, the ‘Explorer’, which will be available with a black backsheet, and ‘Scientist’, which targets the highest possible efficiency.
All of the modules will be supplied with a 15-year product warranty and 25-year performance warranty, which specifies 0.4% annual degradation from year 2 to year 25, leaving the module with 88.9% of its initial performance after 25 years in operation.
Following today’s announcement, Longi expects to have the full Hi-MO 6 range in mass production before the end of 2022.

Utility-scale projects have proliferated in recent years and the services that big batteries can provide in this deregulated market are also expanding.
In another busy week for the UK battery energy storage sector, NextEnergy Solar Fund (NESF) said it has acquired a “strategic portfolio” of battery storage projects located in eastern England. The solar PV and fund said that it has acquired the 250 MW/500 MWh portfolio from an undisclosed developer for about GBP 32.5 million ($37.4 million).
According to NESF, the project has secured planning permission and grid-connection rights. It will likely be switched on in 2025. It will provide grid-balancing services in a part of the grid that is often flooded by wind energy.
At a nearby location, London-based asset manager Gore Street Energy recently acquired a 200 MW construction-ready BESS from Kona Energy. The project located in Heysham, in northwestern England, will help to stabilize energy influx from nearby offshore wind farms, while also providing reactive power and inertia services to support the local grid.
It will likely be connected to National Grid's main transmission network by the fourth quarter of 2026. The move marks the listed investment fund’s largest project acquisition to date, bringing its total portfolio of contracted or operational BESS assets to 898 MW.
Spanish developer Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV), meanwhile, has acquired two BESS projects with a combined capacity of 100 MW from RE Projects Development Ltd. It said the two 50 MW lithium-ion battery projects are located in the Midlands and are scheduled to enter the ready-to-build phase in the third quarter of 2023.
Tyler Hill Renewables, which sourced the acquisition opportunity for FRV, is helping with the development process. In October, FRV and Tyler Hill Renewables launched a platform to develop, build and operate up to 1GW/2GWh of battery energy storage system projects in the United Kingdom over the next five years for GBP 1 billion. FRV currently has five UK battery energy storage projects in operation, under construction, and in development, totaling 340 MW.
More recently, Masdar – a state-owned renewables developer in the United Arab Emirates – acquired London-based BESS developer Arlington Energy. The Abu Dhabi-headquartered company said the acquisition “will enable [it] to expand its presence in the UK and European renewable energy markets.”
Arlington Energy claims to “have a proven record in developing, building, operating and financing flexible energy solutions,” with more than 170 MW of assets under its belt. With Masdar’s backing, the London-based company says it will accelerate its BESS rollout in the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom might need as much as 50 GW of storage capacity by 2050, in order to achieve its target of net-zero carbon emissions, according to the National Grid.
RenewableUK figures from April show that the total pipeline of battery projects in the country has doubled from 16.1 GW a year ago to 32.1 GW at present. Operational battery storage project capacity grew by 45%, from 1.1 GW to 1.6 GW, and the capacity of projects under construction has more than doubled to 1.4 GW. An additional 10.4 GW has been approved, while 7.7 GW has been submitted in the planning system.

The pilot project is located off the coast of Haiyang, Shandong province. It uses patented offshore floating solar technology from Norway-based Ocean Sun.
The two solar floaters have installed capacities of 0.5 MWp and are connected to a transformer on a SPIC-owned wind turbine. They are linked to the power grid via a subsea cable.
The partners plan to build a floating wind-solar project with a total capacity of 20 MW in 2023, upon completion of the pilot run. They will use Ocean Sun’s technology. SPIC said the “successful implementation” of the project will unlock the potential of hybrid offshore power plants.
“The successful project funded by SPIC and constructed using the Ocean Sun solution shows how the common goal of reducing greenhouse CO2 emissions will be achieved with development across borders,” said Børge Bjørneklett, the CEO and founder of Ocean Sun.
Ocean Sun signed an agreement to license its proprietary floating solar technology for the project in July.

Due to an accidental power outage, the researchers discovered that the material's performance fell sharply in the dark, despite literature stating that it is not sensitive to light. They repeated the experiments and came up with the idea of transparent water cells containing the water to introduce light into the water-splitting process. In contrast to the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), “the proposed light-triggered coupled oxygen evolution mechanism requires the unit cell to undergo reversible geometric conversion between octahedron (NiO6) and square planar (NiO4) to achieve electronic states (around the Fermi level) with alternative metal and oxygen characters throughout the oxygen evolution process,” the team said in “Pivotal role of reversible NiO6 geometric conversion in oxygen evolution,” which was recently published in Nature. This electron transfer pathway can bypass the oxygen-oxygen bonding in AEM and the deprotonation in LOM. 
Oman‘s Ministry of Energy and Minerals has unveiled a new national green hydrogen strategy, with a production target of 1 million tons by 2030. It will set targets, a measurement mechanism, and a follow-up methodology for the initiatives and projects in collaboration with local and international companies. The plan includes the creation of a center that will undertake the supervising and followup plans and programs of carbon neutrality, likely in special economic zones, and a new state-owned hydrogen company called Hydrom, which will open a public bidding round on Nov. 6. The company aims to award the first land blocks by 2023, in order to meet the 2030 production target.
Nikola Corp. and KeyState have teamed up to create a low-carbon hydrogen production value chain, including fully integrated commercial carbon capture and storage, in Pennsylvania. KeyState, a hydrogen and chemicals production facility, will supply Nikola with up to 100 metric tons per day of low-carbon hydrogen. The site will be operational in 2026 and will integrate carbon capture from autothermal reforming with onsite geological carbon sequestration. The two sides are also working to develop a liquefaction solution to support the distribution of hydrogen from the project to Nikola's planned refueling network under development. 
The UK government has sent an open letter to Gas Distribution Networks inviting it to propose plans for a pilot hydrogen town. The companies will then complete a plan so the government can make strategic decisions about the role of hydrogen in heating by 2026. They said they could launch a hydrogen-heated town pilot by 2030. 
Hexagon Purus has signed a four-year supply agreement with CaetanoBus as its preferred supplier of hydrogen fuel systems for serially produced, fuel-cell transit buses. Hexagon Purus will supply the hydrogen fuel systems from its facility in Kassel, Germany. The estimated potential value over the lifetime of the agreement is €35 million ($34.6 million). 
Flowserve and Chart Industries have signed an agreement to support the growth of hydrogen. “Flowserve will acquire in-process R&D related to Chart's liquid hydrogen fueling pump and will be Chart's sole manufacturer and supplier of the pump once commercial production has begun,” said the Texas-based flow control products and services specialist.

The city of Cottbus, Germany, has passed a statute resolution for one of the country’s largest floating PV projects. The 21 MW floating solar array will be built on Cottbus Ostsee, a former mine site.
The project developers, Leag and EP New Energies (EPNE), now want to submit a planning application for the planned floating PV system by the end of this year. Once the building permit has been obtained, the installation of the mooring and anchor system could begin next spring, said the companies.
“Although the floating solar system on the 1,900-hectare Cottbus Ostsee is to take up less than 1% of the lake area, the system will make an important contribution to the climate-friendly power supply of the Cottbus port district,” said Fabian von Oesen, the head of renewable energy at Leag.
Seawater heat pumps and wind turbines might be added to the project at a later stage.
“In addition to solar, wind and lake thermal energy on the Cottbus Ostsee provide us with other options for using renewable energy sources and thus gradually strengthening the green powerhouse in Lusatia,” said von Oesen.
