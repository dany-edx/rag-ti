https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/10/new-refrigerant-circuit-for-safer-more-efficient-heat-pumps/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 10, 2022","New refrigerant circuit for safer, more efficient heat pumps","Researchers at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute ISE, together with a consortium of heat pump manufacturers, aim to develop a refrigeration circuit for brine heat pumps with propane refrigerant charges between 15g to 30g/kW, as part of the LC150 (low charge 150 g) research project.
“In Germany, only heat pumps using less than 150 grams of propane can be installed inside houses, for safety reasons,” Claudia Hanisch, in charge of communications at Fraunhofer ISE, told pv magazine.
The team have now achieved a new efficiency record and surpassed this goal, building a device with a maximum heating capacity of 12.8 kW using only 124 grams of propane, with an efficiency of 4.7%. This amounts to a refrigerant charge of 9.7g/kW, roughly equivalent to the amount of propane in five cigarette lighters.
Because it uses less propane, which is flammable, the new circuit is safer. The team says it also improves on price and efficiency. Commercially available heat pumps currently use around 60 grams of propane per kilowatt of heating capacity, meaning the device beats their refrigerant charge sixfold.
The refrigeration circuit cannot be commercialized in its current form, because it uses a semi-hermetic automotive compressor which isn’t designed for the long operating hours required for heat pumps over periods of 20 years, according to a Fraunhofer ISE statement.
“However, the manufacturer is already working on fully hermetic compressors with a longer service life,” said Clemens Dankwerth, project manager at the research institution.
The goal is for the final version of the refrigeration circuit to use slightly more refrigerant and have a slightly larger heat exchanger to achieve a more balanced system.
The team is confident they will achieve the 15g/kW refrigerant charge goal under real operating conditions. So far, a refrigeration circuit using a conventional fully hermetic compressor has been the second-best forming device in their test program, achieving a charge of 164 grams of propane at an efficiency of 4.8% and a heating capacity of 8.1 kW, amounting to a 20g/kW refrigerant charge.
The Fraunhofer ISE project team has been building prototypes for brine heat pumps since October 2021, assembling the individual components (evaporator, compressor, condenser, heat exchanger and expansion valve) in a variety of different constellations, according to statement by the institution. The devices are measured on test stands 24 hours a day for two weeks at a time. Each prototype is run at between 30 and 150 operating points, and the measured values are recorded by 26 sensors. The team has built 26 prototypes so far.
In addition to the compressor, the research team also adjusted other factors to reduce the amount of refrigerant, including reducing the internal volume of the heat exchangers and the amount of oil required. Additional components such as sensors have been kept to a minimum, and the piping has been kept as short as possible to reduce internal volumes, the institution said in a statement.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/10/eu-solar-big-buyers-initiative-set-to-launch-in-november/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,EUROPE",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"OCTOBER 10, 2022",EU solar ‘big buyers’ initiative set to launch in November,"A European Commission program that aims to support public bodies like city or regional administrations to purchase rooftop solar systems is set to go live in November. The program, which is being launched by its DG Growth initiative, aims to make the public procurement of rooftop solar systems easier for EU cities, regions, and member states.
Technical, administrative and procedural guidance at the European level is set to be provided by the commission to municipalities looking to procure solar. The rooftop solar “big buyers for climate and environment” initiative will be extended to PV and could assist public bodies to acquire rooftop solar systems, allowing them to both reduce their energy costs and make progress towards their carbon reduction goals.
Schools, medical facilities, sport halls, libraries, and swimming pools all make excellent candidates for rooftop PV – with solar able to supply much of the buildings’ daytime electricity demand. With electricity prices high and increasing, due to the European energy crisis, the case for rooftop PV on public buildings has never been more compelling.
Regulatory delays
Complex and potential restrictive public procurement rules can delay city or regional administrations from adopting rooftop solar. The “big buyers’” initiative looks to overcome this hurdle through providing administrative and technical advice to public authorities.
“It means that the [European] Commission will be offering both money and expertise for cities, regions, and member states who want to engage in these types of projects,” said Martija Matokovic, a policy officer with the commission, at the RE-Source event on Oct. 7 in Amsterdam. “One of the topics we will look at is how to translate technical requirements and technical specifications.”
The Dutch Public Procurement Expertise Center (Pianoo) has been selected to assist the commission with the solar “big buyers’” initiative. It has been tasked with a range of activities including the organizing of meetings and the exchange of information between interested bodies.
A broad definition is being applied by DG Growth as to which bodies qualify as “Big Buyers,” in the new initiative. These can include small and large regions, regional capitals, and big European cities. “But that’s not to say that small cities won’t be eligible,” said Matokovic.
The program may be extended the power purchase agreements (PPAs), Matokovic added. While the direct purchase of rooftop systems is the primary goal.
“It will solely be solar energy,” said Matokovic. “Both how to buy solar energy, potentially via PPAs, but primarily how to buy the equipment and install it.”
The potential for public bodies to accelerate their adoption of rooftop PV is a significant one. Ivan Ivankovic, the head of energy and climate for the city of Zagreb, spoke at RE-Source 2022. He noted that the city’s “solarization” program went live in January 2022. It aims to install 50 MW of rooftop PV across some of the city’s 1,000 public-building rooftops by 2024.
“Although, that is a modest goal that we think we will overshoot,” said Ivankovic. “We have a big ambition, we have the roofs availability, we need to develop decentralized, onsite integrated PV plans if we want to meet our goals and wean ourselves off fossil fuels as much as possible.”
Zagreb, like most of Croatia, has ample sunshine and electricity demand that increases in the sunny summer months, when tourists flock to the country. Ivankovic reported that the complexity of public procurement rules can make it difficult for cities such as Zagreb to adopt solar.
“Public procurement rules are very, very rigid,” the Zagreb city official explained. “EU directive and public procurement are wide enough to acquire PV power plants, but at the implementation process is long and laborious. There needs to be work in educating public procurement officers.”
It is hoped the new rooftop PV program will support European PV production, which is also being supported by DG Growth through the anticipated, but delayed, Solar PV Alliance. However, the mechanisms as to how this would be done was not revealed at the RE-Source vent.
DG Growth has initiated “big buyers’” programs in other sectors such as transportation, construction, and in waste collection. More details on the solar program are expected on its launch in November.

“We are working with a local building product manufacturer with a research aim to develop solar tiles incorporating our technology,” researcher Zhong Tao told pv magazine. “We are very close to get funding with a total value of AUD 1 million ($648,760). The coating is close to commercial maturity, as we have used commercial products in our research. However, we believe further improvements can be made to the coating materials to improve their performance, which is part of our ongoing research.”
The scientists prepared mortar tile samples with a thickness of 27 mm and wrapped them with cling film and cured them for 48 hours before demoulding. They then stored the samples in a plastic wrap for 28 days prior to painting and used five commercially available reflecting coatings for their trials.
“The mortar samples were first painted with one layer of coating, following the instructions given by the manufacturers,” the scientists said. “After that, the samples were cured in an oven at a temperature of 25 C for 24 hours before applying the second layer of coating. Then the samples were cured in the oven again for a further 48 hours at 25 C.”
The researchers tested the tiles in a polystyrene control chamber equipped with a metal halide lamp. They found that the best-performing coating was able to limit the temperature of the tile to 63.6 C, while the worst-performing coating achieved 74.9 C.
“In the laboratory test, it was found that the reflecting coating could reduce the surface temperature by 11 C, leading to an electrical efficiency improvement of 6.61%; while in the natural environment test, the observed temperature reduction was 10 C, providing an electrical efficiency improvement of 6%,” said the group.
The academics described the coating tech in “Effect of reflective coating on thermal and electrical performances of solar roof tiles,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management.
“Although a suitable reflecting coating can potentially improve the electrical and thermal performances of solar roof tiles during operation, further study is needed to evaluate the economic feasibility of the proposed system,” they said.
In 2020, the same researchers unveiled a phase-change material (PCM) with a cooling function for solar tiles. They built a PCM solar tile that reportedly provides 4.1% more power than a PV tile without a cooling agent. In its most recent study, it explained that the PCM could be combined with the reflective coating to further improve solar tile efficiency.

“The housing cooperative chose a grid-autonomous direct current variant, in which solar power is used exclusively for water heating,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “In addition, we installed an independent system for monitoring and measuring data acquisition.”
The 14 flats are each connected to their own 1.36 kW PV systems, with four 340 W modules. The rooftop arrays are directly connected without inverters to my-PV's Elwa DC electric hot water preparation system, which is connected to a 150-liter boiler.
“Our units can easily reach temperatures above 85 C,” the spokesperson said. “When in contact with drinking water, however, we recommend heating to a maximum of 60 C to prevent calcification of the heating rod.”
The company initially told the housing cooperative to set the backup boost temperature to 50 C.
“At this value, all individual needs of the residents are usually met, but the residents agreed on a temperature of 60 C,” the spokesperson said.
The solar arrays were able to reach an all-time share of 81% in domestic hot water production in the year to July 2021, with grid electricity covering the remaining percentage. For all of 2020, solar had a share of 37% and in the following year it increased to around 50%.
The core technology provided by my-PV for the project is the photovoltaic heating rod.
“This costs less than €700 excluded VAT,” the spokesperson said. “The power electronics, the control system and the user interfaces are included. Extra costs compared to a normal electric boiler are, apart from the additional costs for our heating rod, only the four modules with substructure and cabling, which is not much when you consider how cheap PV modules already are.”
Last year, my-PV unveiled a rooftop PV solution for thermal concrete-core activation in commercial buildings. The special configuration conveys surplus electricity generated from the rooftop array to an electric underfloor heating system, which transfers the energy to the foundation. The company said the proposed solution could reduce a building's annual water and power costs by around 67%, compared to standard heating.

The researchers said in a recent paper in Advanced Energy Materials that a novel compound of molybdenum-tungsten-niobate (MWNO) with fast rechargeability and high efficiency could potentially replace graphite in commercial batteries. They focused on a problem that graphite anodes encounter during the charging process, when the electrolyte decomposes and forms a buildup on the anode. This buildup slows the movement of lithium ions and can limit battery stability and performance. “Because of this sluggish lithium-ion movement, graphite anodes are seen as a roadblock to extreme fast charging. We are looking for new, low-cost materials that can outperform graphite,” said ORNL postdoctoral researcher Runming Tao. The Department of Energy's extreme fast-charging goal for EVs is set at 15 minutes or less to compete with refuel times on gas-powered vehicles – a milestone that has not been met with graphite. “This material operates at a higher voltage than graphite and is not prone to forming what is called a ‘passivation solid electrolyte layer’ that slows down the lithium-ion movement during charging. Its exceptional capacity and fast-charging rate, combined with a scalable synthesis method, make it an attractive candidate for future battery materials,” said Tao.
General Motors and EV battery developer OneD Battery Sciences have signed a joint R&D agreement focused for the potential use of OneD’s silicon nanotechnology in GM’s Ultium battery cells. GM Ventures and Volta Energy Technologies also participated in OneD's Series C funding round, which the company recently closed at $25 million. The focus of the collaboration is OneD’s SINANODE platform, which adds more silicon onto the anode battery cells by fusing silicon nanowires into EV-grade graphite. Silicon can store 10 times more energy than graphite but most attempts to include more silicon in the anode faced challenges of silicon expansion and breakage. “This limited the amount used to extremely small percentages and only modest performance improvements,” OneD said. “Being able to add larger amounts of silicon – efficiently – is the essential breakthrough needed to produce competitive EVs that meet market demand for high-performance, affordable vehicles.” Under a licensing business model, GM will tap OneD’s 15-year, 240-patent track record, with a focus on increasing energy density and reducing the cost of future GM EV batteries. “GM designed Ultium to be a supremely flexible platform so we can continuously improve our cells as battery technology advances,” said Kent Helfrich, GM CTO, vice president of GM R&D. GM will scale its Ultium EV Platform to 1 million units of annual EV production capacity in North America by 2025. Earlier this year, GM’s first joint venture battery plant with LG Energy for Ultium Cells began production in Ohio, with two additional US plants now under construction and a fourth in the planning stage.
Volvo has unveiled it first electric vehicle with bidirectional charging. Its upcoming all-electric flagship SUV EX90 will support both V2G and V2H applications, so car owners will be able to decide whether to keep their electricity to power their homes or send it back to grid. The EVs will also operate as vehicle-to-load (V2L) battery storage systems. “With the Volvo EX90 you can power your life,” said Olivier Loedel, Volvo's head of electrification ecosystem. “You could use its battery in many ways, from topping up your electric bike when you’re out and about, to hooking up an outdoor cooking appliance for your weekend camping trip. It could even power your house during the expensive peak hours of the day.” Volvo sees potential to pool EVs in virtual power plants to relieve strain on the grid and cover short periods of instability. But not all of those features and capabilities will be available in all markets, it said. “The bi-directional charging offer will initially be launched in selected markets,” said the carmaker. “We are currently investigating which use cases we will be able to offer in different markets.”
Shoals Technologies has achieved UL Standards certification for its first set of aboveground eMobility charging solutions. The listed products include its Fuel Power Center, Big Lead Assembly (BLA) for DC or AC power, raceways and quick connect bases for chargers. Shoals, a major provider of balance-of-system equipment for solar and energy storage projects, claims its system to lay cables and wires above the ground could help slash 20% of 40% off the cost of typical EV charger installations.
The European Parliament’s Transport Committee has adopted a draft negotiating mandate on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure on main EU roads. The draft aims to accelerate the expansion of the EV charging and H2 refueling infrastructure. It wants electric charging pools for cars to be deployed at 60 kilometers intervals along major European roads by 2026. Among other proposals, the draft calls for two truck charging stations per parking place from 2028 instead of 2031, as proposed by the commission.
Hyundai and Australia's Ampol have announced plans to expand opportunities for hydrogen infrastructure and battery EVs. Hyundai EV drivers will pay less to charge their cars at Ampol stations across its growing AmpCharge network, along with potential bundled energy offers incorporating home charging and other energy solutions. Ampol recently opened its first sites under the AmpCharge banner, marking the start of an initial rollout of 120 EV fast-charging sites at Ampol stores by the end of 2023. The companies will also collaborate on integrated solutions for fuel cell electric vehicles powered by hydrogen. They said they will also explore the development of hydrogen infrastructure and fleets.

It said the country's installed generating capacity now exceeds 12 GW, and new projects require a significant expansion of its grid. It is also talking to investors about the necessary changes.
“The absolute limit of the electricity system has been reached, which requires urgent and adequate planning of the future expansion of the electricity transmission system,” it said. “ESO is currently holding a series of meetings with renewable energy investors to discuss joint, coordinated actions to meet the huge investor interest in building new renewable energy assets.”
Bulgaria could become one of the most dynamic solar markets in Europe in 2024, according to a recent report by SolarPower Europe. It said the country reached 1.1 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of 2020 and will reach 3.8 GW by 2024. Market uptake will mainly be supported by unsubsidized large-scale solar via power purchase agreements.
“The current support schemes for solar in Bulgaria focus on PPA and prosumers and there is no auction system for utility-scale PV,” the report said. “Introducing an auction system could provide incentives and unlock the immense solar potential in Bulgaria, one of the highest in Europe.”
Non-hydropower renewables make up around 2.3 GW of Bulgaria's 12.4 GW power generating fleet, with lignite and hard coal-fired power stations supplying 4.5 GW, hydro 3.2 GW, nuclear 2 GW, and natural gas 600 MW.

“With these new exemptions we are removing barriers and ensuring that individuals, communities, businesses and farms can generate their own electricity, reduce their own bills and play their part in creating a zero-carbon future fuelled by renewable energy,” said Minister Darragh O’Brien.
The measures will bring Ireland into line with the EU Solar Rooftops Initiative by making solar rooftop installations shorter and simpler. Under the new rules, homeowners will be allowed to use 100% of their rooftop surfaces for PV systems, from just 50%.
“The new exemptions for educational/community/ religious buildings will also give institutions such as schools greater opportunity to reduce their energy bills,” the minister said. “The new exemptions will provide new financial and climate-related opportunities for farmers, underpinned by available grants.”
Wall-mounted modules and free-standing solar panels will also be exempt from having to obtain planning permission, subject to a 25-square-meter area limit. 
Ireland supports rooftop PV operating under its net metering scheme, via a rebate program. The scheme is designed to deploy around 380 MW of solar capacity.

Hurricane Ian was almost a Category 5 storm when it made landfall near Fort Meyers, Florida. Babcock Ranch, a community just 12 miles from Fort Meyers, found itself directly in the path of the storm. 
The storm brought record-breaking storm surges and sustained winds above 100 mph. More than 2.6 million Florida customers were left without power. 
Despite the widespread destruction, Babcock Ranch, a planned community of more than 2,000 homes, retained powered throughout the entire storm, reports CNN. It is often a given conclusion that power will be lost during extreme weather events, but Babcock Ranch has a model that bucks the centralized natural gas-burning energy model that serves much of the Sunshine State. The community is 100% powered by solar. 
A 75 MW solar facility powers the planned community, with 700,000 panels delivering clean energy to its residents. It is connected by a small distribution system of wires buried beneath the ground, thereby avoiding outages from downed wires. The ranch also designed streets as floodways, planted native species to control flooding, and exceeded robust Florida building codes when it was planned and built in 2018. 
Many residents also installed their own rooftop solar panels and batteries for increased resiliency and extended backup power. Electric vehicles are driven by many of its residents, and sustainability and climate resilience are core to Babcock Ranch’s identity. 
“We have proof of the case now because [the hurricane] came right over us,” Nancy Chorpenning, a 68-year-old Babcock Ranch resident, told CNN. “We have water, electricity, internet — and we may be the only people in Southwest Florida who are that fortunate.” 
The Babcock Neighborhood School was designated by the state as an official shelter area. These designated shelters typically are equipped with a mandated gas generator, but this was not the case for Babcock. Instead, the solar array kept the shelter powered continuously throughout the storm. 
“It’s a great case study to show that it can be done right, if you build in the right place and do it the right way,” said Lisa Hall, a spokesperson for the founder of Babcock Ranch. “Throughout all this, there’s just so many people saying, ‘it worked, that this was the vision, this is the reason we moved here,’” Hall told CNN.
The American Red Cross is accepting donations for victims of Hurricane Ian, bringing critical supplies and support to survivors.

“The high-efficiency panel is characterized by having all electrical contacts on its backside and is based on the cell technology Zebra developed by the German research institute ISC Konstanz,” Product Manager Lisa Hirvonen, told pv magazine. “The module series offers an elegant totally black module appearance particularly suitable for visual residential roofs and buildings with a high architectural value.”
The FU415-425M ZEBRA Pro module features 132 IBC half-cut cells with a size of 166 mm x 83 mm. It is available in three versions, with nominal power ranging from 415 W to 425 W and a power conversion efficiency of 21.10% to 21.60%. The open-circuit voltage spans from 45.85 V to 46.01 V and the short-circuit current from 11.57 A to 11.76 A.
The new product measures 1,895 mm x 1039 mm x 35 mm and weighs in at 21 kg. It is fabricated with 3.2 mm glass and an anodized aluminum frame. The module can operate with a system voltage of 1,500 V and temperatures ranging between -40 C and 85 C. It features a temperature coefficient of -0.29% per degree Celsius.
The product, which comes with a 25-year warranty and 25-year performance guarantee, is also said to show a maximum output drop of 0.25% per year, with around 93% of output expected at the end of the 25th year of operation.
“We are currently working on an ambitious project to open a module factory also in Italy to give our contribution to the revival of the European PV supply chain with a production ramp-up scheduled to take place within 2023. This Italian factory will focus its production mainly on IBC panels” Hirvonen stated. “At the same time, expansion plans are also ongoing in China where we may soon reach 2 GW of production capacity.”
The company is based in Cittadella, Italy. Its Italian staff focus on R&D in areas such as interdigitated back-contact (IBC) cells, cylindrical ribbons, glass-glass solutions and modules with independent sections.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/10/why-do-solar-power-plants-work-inefficiently/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 10, 2022",Why do solar power plants work inefficiently?,"The efficiency of a solar power plant is affected by many factors, from dust, dirt, pollen, and shadows cast by trees, to the failure of various parts, connectors and cables. To ensure the best return on investment, it is important to accurately identify problems and eliminate them on time. All of this is taken care of by the monitoring equipment of the solar power plant, except for physical repairs and equipment replacement.
The PV inverters of some manufacturers have integrated monitoring solutions that allow you to see the amount of electricity produced or several other parameters. However, those who know the specifics of solar power plants understand very well that this is just a drop in the ocean. Knowing only one or a few parameters makes it impossible to fully assess the power plant’s efficiency, to notice the nuances that influence it, and to anticipate possible breakdowns or energy loss due to neglect.
Standard monitoring tools monitor several parameters related to the energy and power produced by the solar plant. This data is usually updated once every 15 minutes. To better understand how the solar power plant works, our team of scientists has developed a monitoring tool that captures an average of 25 parameters, and the data is updated every 10 seconds. Ten times more data allows supervisors to ensure extremely accurate monitoring and react to problems in real time.
Our internal data shows that solar plants rarely reach their declared maximum capacity. This is because they are tested and their maximum power is determined under laboratory conditions that are rarely achieved in reality. Inion Software’s experience shows that the attitude of the manufacturers has a great influence: in many cases, the documentation of cheap equipment produced outside European Union (EU) indicates the maximum power that can be achieved under ideal conditions, while EU manufacturers calculate the minimum amount of electricity their power plants will produce under ideal conditions. In other words, it is practically impossible to see the figures declared by the cheap producers in reality, while EU-made power plants can achieve even higher production.
However, the efficiency of even two identical solar power plants installed in different locations can differ significantly. Not only due to cloudiness, seasonality, direction or angle of the roof, but also for many other reasons.
Our research shows that if even a small area of the solar panel is covered, for example, by falling leaves, dirt, or the shadow of a tree or bush – the overall efficiency of the power plant is significantly reduced. In some cases, even a tenth of the covered area can reduce total production by up to 30%. Therefore, periodic cleaning of solar modules, pruning of surrounding vegetation and similar maintenance play a crucial role.
The infographic below shows how the power plant’s efficiency is reduced if leaves fall on one of the panels:

Not all problems are noticed and solved so simply. Solar power plants are full of equipment, connectors, and other components that can fail or disconnect unexpectedly. As a result, electricity production can be reduced or even completely stopped. There are many different examples. The information we have gathered shows that a common problem with solar power plants is inventories heating up. They are usually housed in closed cabinets that protect them from rain, snow, and other environmental factors, but this poses a risk of overheating.
Even the smallest nuances, such as poorly sealed connections, can cause problems. Moisture entering through them can interfere with proper operation. For example, inverters affected by morning dew may measure the isolation resistance incorrectly and fail to start on time. An average solar park can lose thousands of euros in revenue per year due to such a failure.
The second infographic shows how the three solar power plants work. Due to poorly sealed connections two fail to start on time:

There are things that simply cannot be fixed or improved – it is natural that solar plants will generate less electricity on cloudy days and in winter, and their efficiency decreases due to wear and tear. The latter factor usually determines a slight, up to 0.5% degradation, decrease in production per year. In other words, if your solar farm produced 10,000 kWh of electricity in the first year, it should still produce about 9,950 kWh in the second year. These are only theoretical calculations, since identical weather conditions do not occur every year. However, in order to distinguish normal fluctuations from anomalies, a high-quality and reliable monitoring system is necessary.
It is common in the market that the operating capacity of a solar power plant is calculated thanks to a solar radiation sensor. It shows whether the solar plant is producing electricity as much as the weather conditions permit. However, this sensor cannot always accurately reflect the real weather conditions, because it often doesn’t work at full capacity due to dust and dirt. As a result, solar farm owners cannot always see if electricity is being produced efficiently. To see more precisely the operation of the power plant, our team of scientists has developed a unique monitoring system that does not require a solar radiation sensor. The efficiency of the solar power plant is compared to the work of nearby power plants.
For example, if on sunny days one solar plant produces less electricity than other plants in the same region, this is a signal that the plant is not operating at full capacity.
The following infographics showing the capacity of a power plant when measured with a solar radiation sensor and measured by taking an average in the region (Red indicates the reference production measured with a solar radiation sensor, while green shows PV generation).



Solar power plants are entering a new stage, when the rapidly improving monitoring equipment will allow the power plant to produce electricity more efficiently.

Brazil surpassed 20 GW of installed solar power at the end of September, according to the Brazilian Association of Photovoltaic Solar Energy (ABSolar), citing data from the energy regulator, Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (ANEEL). 
The nation has 6,525 MW of utility-scale solar plants and 13,579 MW of distributed-generation PV under the country's net metering scheme. 
ANEEL said utility-scale PV developers will likely add another 1,760 MW of capacity by the end of this year. Most of it – about 1.6 GW – will be built outside the regulated market through power purchase agreements.
According to ABSolar, the country will finish this year with 24,928 MW of cumulative PV capacity. But for this to happen, developers will need to install another 3.5 GW of distributed-generation PV by the end of December.

The DoE said that the preferential lane will be given to plants operating under the “Must Dispatch” and “Priority Dispatch” categories.
The first one is represented by all renewable energy facilities powered by wind, solar, run-of-river hydro, or ocean energy, regardless of whether they are being operated under the feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme.
“The enjoyment of ‘Must Dispatch' is based on the difficulty to precisely predict the availability of RE resource, thereby making the energy generated variable and irregular and the availability of resource inherently uncontrollable pursuant to Section 20 of the Renewable Energy Act,” said the DoE.
The second category only covers biomass plants operating under the FIT system.
“Granting all generating units utilizing RE resources either ‘Must Dispatch' or ‘Priority Dispatch' will aid in accelerating the development and utilization of indigenous RE resources and reduce the dependence on imported conventional energy sources,” said Energy Secretary Carlos Jericho Petilla. “This will minimize the country’s exposure to price fluctuations in the global market, making the supply and delivery of electric power more stable and secured from international geopolitical conflicts.”
In addition, the DoE has also started to review the Renewable Energy Act, which was issued in 2008. It aims to amend the rule requiring renewable energy projects to be at least 60% owned by domestic investors.
However, local media reports suggest that the measure will help the country to achieve its renewable energy targets.
“The DoE is preparing the necessary amendments to Rule 6, Section 19 of the IRR of the RE Law,” said Lotilla.
The country plans to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030. Recent statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency show that the Philippines had an installed PV capacity of 1.08 GW at the end of 2021. Most of the nation’s solar facilities were secured under the old feed-in tariff regime, auctions, and net metering programs.
