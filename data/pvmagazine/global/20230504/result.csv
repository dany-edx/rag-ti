Mass manufacturing is expected to start in 2025, with manufacturing capacities scaling up into the double-digit GWh-scale.
Leveraging its group’s expertise in EV technology, Rimac Energy has developed a novel battery architecture that is said to reduce efficiency losses by up to 50% while decreasing the system footprint by up to 40% compared to current state-of-the-art solutions.
According to the manufacturer, additional technological benefits of its new stationary ESS solution include improved cycle life, built-in redundancy for increased availability, as well as competitive material and installation costs.
“Given our track record in innovative battery technology, we believe we will play a vital role in building Europe's future energy ecosystems, elevating it on the global stage,” said Rimac Energy's Director Wasim Sarwar.
The Rimac Energy team has been built within Rimac Technology and under the roof of the Rimac Group over the last 18 months and now consists of 60 employees, who are presently working on its first generation of stationary ESS.
Initially, Rimac Energy will provide solutions for large commercial, industrial, and utility-scale applications, with battery-buffered solutions for fast and MW-scale charging already underway.
According to the company, several customer projects are in discussion, including a pilot with a leading renewable energy company to provide battery storage solutions for their solar and wind power plants. These pilot systems are expected to be produced by the end of this year and commissioned in 2024.
“Given our head start in EV technology and dedication to sustainability, this path feels like a seamless progression for us,” said Rimac Group founder and CEO, Mate Rimac, who is often referred to as “Europe’s Elon Musk”.
Headquartered in Sveta Nedelja, near Croatia’s capital Zagreb, the Rimac Group manufactures hypercars and develops high-performance electrification, including batteries and power trains, and software solutions for some of the world’s largest OEMs, including Mercedes, Jaguar, Renault, and Hyundai, among others.
The company was founded in 2009 and grew out of Rimac’s garage hobby. Its stated mission was to build the world's first electric sports car at the time when high-performance EV components were not available on the market. The company developed the necessary parts in-house and patented 24 innovations.
Today, the Rimac Group is a majority shareholder of the luxury carmaker Bugatti Rimac joint venture with a 55% stake, and the remaining 45% owned by Volkswagen’s sports car unit Porsche. The Group is the sole stakeholder of Rimac Technology.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/04/average-silver-price-expected-to-drop-2-to-21-30-per-ounce-this-year/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 4, 2023",Average silver price expected to drop 2% to $21.30 per ounce this year,"Demand for silver from the PV industry increased by 28% from 110.0 million ounces (Moz) in 2021 to 140.3 Moz last year, according to the “World Silver Survey 2023,” which was recently published by the Silver Institute.
The report also reveals that silver demand in the solar industry may reach 161.1 Moz this year, which would represent a 15% growth compared to 2022.
“The increase in PV cell production was much faster than silver thrifting, and this in turn helped drive the 6% rise for global electronics and electrical demand,” the institute experts said, referring to last year's performance. “In 2023, we expect industrial fabrication will reach another all-time high, boosted by continued gains in photovoltaic applications as well as healthy offtake from other industrial segments.”
Global silver demand reached 1,055.6 Moz and 1,242.4 Moz in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and is expected to drop 6% this year to 1,167.0 Moz.
The average silver price for 2023 is expected to reach $21.30 per ounce, which would be around 2% lower than a year earlier. The Silver Institute said that it expects the price will trade in the low $18 per ounce in the fourth quarter.
“Along with record silver demand and lower mine production, the silver market achieved its second consecutive annual structural deficit, at a significant 237.7 Moz last year,” the authors of the report stated, noting that the combined shortfalls of the previous two years “comfortably” offset the cumulative surpluses of the last 11 years.
“This year is expected to be another of solid silver demand,” they added. “Industrial fabrication should reach an all-time high, boosted by continued gains in the PV market and healthy offtake from other industrial segments.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/04/euro-solar-is-surfacing/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,GERMANY",,"MAY 4, 2023",Euro solar is Surfacing,"From pv magazine 05/23.
In late 2021, M10 Industries, a German manufacturing equipment supplier, and the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, a research body, first published details of their shingled cell matrix technology. After a development period of just seven months, the two partners were able to demonstrate a manufacturing tool ready for series production, which they have named Surface.
This resulted in the 2021 foundation of M10 Solar Equipment GmbH, a joint venture set up by M10 Industries and Zahoransky, an automation equipment supplier, to begin producing Surface machines for large-scale, commercial PV cell interconnection, at the JV’s facility in Freiburg, Germany.
The potential is tremendous. The stringer system is the world’s first – and thus far, only – series-produced wiring machine for shingle matrix solar modules that lays and connects the shingled cells in an offset pattern across the entire surface of a module, similar to the way bricks are laid out in a wall. The conventional method of connecting cells – in which they are aligned vertically and connected as a string – is replaced by a method where cell strips are laid across the surface and connected so they overlap while being offset vertically. Electrons flow over the entire surface of the resulting module matrix, in series and in parallel.
On building facades in particular, the shingled cell matrix approach shows its strength. The technology produces aesthetically appealing modules with no gaps between cells and also offers strong shading tolerance to boost performance. Since introducing the production machine – able to process 12,000 cell strips of any size per hour – at last year’s Intersolar Europe trade show, M10 Solar has drawn interest from a range of PV manufacturers. A factory is in service at the M10 site to support potential customers with development and production of prototype modules.
During the machine’s development phase, the responsible parties were asking themselves whether it would be able to process 12,000 cell strips per hour in operation and, if so, whether that would be the limit. What degrees of staggering and scaling would be realistic, asked the partners.
Philipp Zahn and Marco Saladin were especially interested in the answers. As joint managing directors, the pair are responsible for the fate of the M10 Solar Equipment venture. A specialist in mechanical engineering and automation, the Zahoransky business had been working with Siemens for many years and the technology companies collaborated again on the Surface innovation process.
“We’d already initiated simulations about 10 years ago, which is very unusual for a medium-sized enterprise,” says Saladin, who previously worked for Zahoransky. Instead of wasting years on table calculations or trial-and-error loops, the business relied on simulation programs for the machine concepts early on.
The managers opted for Siemens’ Tecnomatix Plant Simulation software, which Zahoransky already had experience with. The software simulates complex production systems and processes in easy-to-understand computer models and is used to simulate, visualize, analyze, and optimize production and logistics processes.
“We were able to make fast and reliable decisions and evaluate different scenarios at an early point in the Surface development phase,” Saladin says. “Plant simulation helped us design the layout, control logic, and resource dimensioning.” Saladin and Zahn believe they have achieved time savings of around 30% over the entire course of the project, thanks to the simulations.
“With plant simulation, we could quickly find the best design for our interconnection system and also achieve maximum throughput,” says Zahn. This both shortened the initial phase of production and eliminated time-consuming and costly corrective measures later in the production process.
With its innovative Surface tool, M10 is thinking far outside the box for PV module production and is looking to play a key role in bringing large scale PV manufacturing back to Europe. “If we want to make a substantial contribution to the energy transition in Europe, we have to revive PV production here at home,” says Saladin. “Our research expertise, product innovations, and historically strong mechanical engineering can be a huge help.”
“It’s ultimately a matter of upscaling while reconstructing entire value chains – despite difficulties in the supply chains, despite price increases, and despite geopolitical uncertainties,” says Zahn. Germany, and indeed the rest of Europe and the world, currently relies heavily on China for the supply of solar cells, modules, and related components. “In Europe, our strength is in innovative production concepts. We need to upscale them,” Saladin says. This means gigawatt-scale factories. “On this scale, simulations are indispensable,” he adds. “They become the most important tool for enabling a fast start at a realistic cost.”
The next issue of pv magazine celebrates China’s journey from solar new entrant to the installation of more than 100 GW(AC) of panels this year – Vincent Shaw and Frank Haugwitz consider a remarkable 20-year journey. We take a look at what Indonesia needs to achieve its net-zero ambition and also explore the stirrings of a solar renaissance in Europe, via buzzing trade shows and gigafatory planning.
Plant simulation is often used in complete-line concepts to optimize throughput, eliminate bottlenecks, and minimize inventory. To analyze the effects of different production versions, the simulation models take into account in-house and external supply chains, production resources, and business processes. At the same time, they can evaluate different line control strategies and synchronize main and auxiliary lines. Plant simulation can define complex material-flow rules and monitor the line’s performance.
Besides Tecnomatix, Siemens offers a complete portfolio of solutions for the entire value chain – from polysilicon production and ingot cutting to cell production and module manufacturing. The integrated solutions for solar panel manufacturers and plant and machine builders include everything from power supply to plant-wide automation.
The goal is always the efficient, flexible, and sustainable production of top-quality solar panels. The M10 stringer system is the first step, and others will follow.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/04/germany-netherland-and-sweden-have-lowest-cost-of-capital-for-utility-scale-pv/,"FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"MAY 4, 2023","Germany, Netherlands and Sweden have lowest cost of capital for utility scale PV","IRENA has published a first-of-its-kind report on the cost of financing for renewable power, covering solar PV, onshore, and offshore wind technologies across all major global markets.
The agency obtained the data from 172 survey answers from 56 experts as well as 33 interviews. The responses provide the cost of capital (CoC) data from 45 countries for at least one of the three renewable technologies across six continents.
The cost of capital expresses the expected financial return, or the minimum required rate, for investing in a company or a project. It is calculated as the weighted average between the costs of debt and equity, where the cost of debt is the interest rate that a project secures from lenders, and the cost of equity is the financial return expected by shareholders in exchange for providing capital.
The cost of capital is a major determinant of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar PV and other renewables. According to IRENA, the total cost of electricity for a representative PV project increases by 80% if the CoC is 10% rather than 2%.
“Even small differences in CoC that are not properly accounted for between countries and technologies can result in significant misrepresentations of renewable energy costs and lead to poor policy making,” IRENA says in the report. “Reliable data and an enhanced understanding of the composition of the CoC and its drivers are therefore critical to developing tailored support mechanisms and market designs that take different technology and country risks into account.”
Results show that for all the locations surveyed the cost of capital for utility-scale PV is lowest in Germany and the Netherlands, both at 2.2%. In Europe, Sweden follows at 3%, with Denmark and the United Kingdom at 3.3%. The CoC in Spain, France, and Italy is 5.1%, 3.4%, and 4.3%, respectively. Ireland, Portugal, and Ukraine show the worst results, at 9.9%, 10%, and 12.2%, respectively.
In North America, the United States has a CoC of 5.4% and Mexico of 8.7%. Chile beats Brazil in South America, with 5.7% against Brazil’s 7.6%. The best results in Africa are from South Africa and Kenya at 6.9%, whereas Tunisia has the worst result of the African countries surveyed at 10.7%. China has one of the best global results at 3.9%, with Australia following closely at 4.6%, and then India at 7.1%.
The good results of China, North America, and Western Europe are underlined by a mature PV market, according to IRENA. “In these locations, renewable energy financing is underwriting the deployment of renewable power generation capacity,” it said in the report.
The agency also noted that the share of debt in the CoC is low in both North America and Western Europe but for different reasons. In the United States, the debt share is typically low, between 35% and 65%, because “the tax credits used to accelerate solar and wind deployment incentivize the use of equity,” whose costs are nevertheless low due to tax credits, IRENA explained. On the other hand, debt share is typically larger in Europe, at 80% or more, but the cost of debt is very low due to low base rates from the banking sector.

The PV system will be integrated into the asphalt top layer and will consist of 600 solar panels of an unspecified type. “This project is mainly intended to gain more experience with the deployment of solar cells on bicycle paths,” the provincial government said, noting that two similar systems have already been deployed along the N395 road near Oirschot and along the N324 road near Grave, in North Brabant itself. 
During a 5-year period, provincial government experts will assess, in particular, the resistance of the solar modules to the mechanical stress applied by the presence of pedestrians and bikers, the costs for their maintenance, and the PV system energy yield.
Solar roads in the Netherlands are not an unfamiliar concept. A bike path near Amsterdam was equipped with solar panels in 2016 and another one was built in 2020 in the province of Utrecht. The feasibility and economic viability of solar roads, however, still remains controversial.
The provincial government said construction of the solar bike lane in Wagenberg is part of a larger project called “Zon op Infra,” a Dutch government plan to test the viability of solar power production on road infrastructure. The plan includes the deployment of solar installations along highways and on noise barriers. 
The Dutch authorities are struggling to identify surfaces on which to deploy large-scale PV plants due to the scarcity of land. In recent years, research institutes and private companies have tried to prove the feasibility of solar projects on non-agricultural land, including dikes, rooftops, onshore and offshore water surfaces.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/04/solar-module-cooling-tech-based-on-nanofluid-jets/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TUNISIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 4, 2023",Solar module cooling tech based on nanofluid jets,"An international research group has developed an active cooling technique for solar panels that utilizes an inclined channel and two jets of nanofluids.
The system consists of a double jet of nanofluid in a 2D channel placed below a heating plate that adheres to the photovoltaic panel. The two jets enter the channel through two slots of width separated by a distance and are perpendicular to the active wall of the channel.
“The cooling system is an inclined channel, with an isothermal heated upper wall, subjected to two jets of nanofluid,” the scientists said, adding that the device uses water mixed with copper nanoparticles as a nanofluid.
“The channel presents an inclination, with the horizontal direction, denoted by angle and whose limit is chosen equal to 30 degrees.This value corresponds to the optimal angle that corresponds to the maximum absorption of the solar radiations by a photovoltaic panel in Tunisia,” they added.
In the proposed system configuration, the channel is heated by its upper wall and cooled by two jets of nanofluids penetrating through its lower wall.
The researchers tested the system with the aim of numerically analyzing the heat transfer and the production of thermal entropy in the nanofluid flowing through an entire channel due to viscous effects. The created entropy characterizes an irreversible process that shows the degradation and usury of the physical system itself, they added.
Through their analysis, they found that the modification of the inclination angle has limited effect on heat transfer and irreversibility, and that the created entropy increases nearly 15% when the nanoparticle concentration reaches 8%. This entropy could result in significant deterioration and usury at the impact locations of the two jets.
The entropy issue may be addressed by increasing the number of jets and the angle of the jets on heat transfer as well as applying hydrodynamics on the created entropy. “This may lead simultaneously to an increase in heat transfer with minimization of the created entropy,” the scientists stated. “This minimization can be achieved in terms of intensity reduction or even in terms of a redistribution of irreversibilities.”
The team did not provide details about the system costs and possible commercial application.
The system is described in the study “Qualitative modeling of solar panel cooling by nanofluid jets: Heat transfer and second law analysis,” published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering. The research group includes academics from the University of Tabuk in Saudi Arabia and the Gabes University in Tunisia.

“Indoor near UV-lights are commonly used as decorative lights for Halloween, Christmas, parties and pubs as well as for increasing plant growth and sterilization in medical settings,” the research's corresponding author, Aruna Ivaturi, told pv magazine. “These devices, however, are not given attention despite their high photon energy. We have demonstrated for the first time the possibility of harvesting such lights using a standard perovskite absorber.”
The scientists build the solar cell with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, an electron transport layer (ETL) made of tin oxide (SnO2), an absorber based on a perovskite known as methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3), a hole transporting layer (HTL) made of Spiro-OMeTAD, and a top electrode based on silver (Ag).
According to Ivaturi, the UV-stable perovskite solar cells with interface modification exhibited high output power of around 1 mW/cm2, which compares to less than 100 µW/cm2 for traditional indoor white light harvesting PV.
The scientists tested the performance of the cell via a near-UV LED that which is generally used for indoor decoration. “The incident power of the UV LED was adjusted by varying the distance between the solar cell and lamp and measured using the ILT350 spectrophotometer having a measurement range of 380 — 780 nm,” they stated, noting that the AM1.5G solar spectrum under 1 Sun, which provides standard illumination conditions, has a near-UV intensity with an input power of 4.6 mW/cm2 at wavelengths below 400 nm. “The maximum intensity for measuring the device performance was fixed at 150 lux, which corresponds to an incident power of 3.76 mW/cm2.”
The champion solar cell built by the research team achieved a power conversion efficiency of efficiency of 26.19%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.90V, a short-circuit current of 1.42 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 77.56%, resulting in a maximum power output of 991.21 μW/cm2.
“The devices without interface modification, upon UV pretreated for 6 h retained 97.18% of their maximum efficiency while 14 h pretreated devices retained 92.38%,” the academics added. “However, further increasing the UV pretreatment time to 24 h led to significant drop in PCE and the devices retained 84.1% of their maximum efficiency.”
They presented the novel cell technology in the paper “Near-Ultraviolet Indoor Black Light-Harvesting Perovskite Solar Cells,” published in Applied Energy Materials. “This work opens up a new direction for advancement in the practical deployment of perovskite solar cells for indoor near-UV light energy harvesting and thus is beneficial for powering modern electronics integrated with sensors and Internet-of-Things (IoTs) located in UV environments such as health care, horticulture, and places with near-UV black light decorations,” they concluded.
*The article was updated on May 5 to reflect that the maximum solar cell efficiency is 26% and not 20%, as we previously reported.

And the key regions are Europe and Latin America. We also have sales in China. In terms of sales, we are split roughly 40% Europe, 40% Latin America and 20% China.
Our modules leave the factory already integrated with microinverters, which makes them a very good fit for smaller projects, such as balcony modules that we see more of, particularly in Europe. With no need for an additional inverter, we offer a ‘plug and play’ device, that users can connect very simply to their home circuits and generate power for their own consumption.
The system we supply features one microinverter for every two or three modules. This setup offers advantages in low-light performance and also makes a good fit for larger rooftops, allowing for modules to be installed across multiple pitches and orientations without limiting each other’s performance. This means systems can achieve better rooftop coverage and generation throughout the day.
Our module and microinverter are designed for each other and supplied preassembled as a single unit, while other AC module systems require assembly, and rely on modules and microinverters from different brands that may not be ideally suited to each other. Our solar unit achieves 97.55% maximum system efficiency, a leading figure in the industry.
It is also a very safe system, with an energy control unit that allows for module-level monitoring and rapid shutdown. Overall, our integrated system achieves a higher return on investment: the system can generate more electricity, and labor and installation costs are significantly reduced.
Our unique front frame design, with no raised edge, allows water to freely run off the module. So there is no water left on the module surface and no build up of dust around the edge of the frame. Dust accumulated on the module surface is easily washed away as soon it rains. We have data from installations in the field that shows an energy yield increase of 6-15% thanks to this feature, and it also helps reduce costs associated with cleaning the modules every so often.
The frame design adds around CNY 0.03-0.05 ($0.0043-0.0072) to the module cost per watt, so very well worth it for this level of energy yield increase.
Previously we have worked with PERC cells, and now we are completing the upgrade of our 5.5 GW production capacity to work with TOPCon.
We cut the cells into three pieces, this keeps the current low. And this also works well with the microinverter to keep currents low in the whole system, minimizing the temperature increase and related power loss.
It’s a little bit more expensive, but much of that can be offset by easier and quicker installation time. For systems up to five kilowatts, the cost is about the same. As systems get larger, the added cost for the microinverter starts to show. However, the accompanying increase in energy yield means we can still be competitive with some larger, commercial-sized installations. And this is why we target the rooftop markets, because we can offer a clear advantage to customers here.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/04/enervenue-completes-metal-hydrogen-battery-safety-testing/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"MAY 4, 2023",EnerVenue completes metal-hydrogen battery safety testing,"US energy storage company EnerVenue has completed UL 9540A cell-, module- and unit-level evaluation of thermal runaway fire propagation. The company has also certified its Energy Storage Vessels to UL 1973.
UL 9540A testing includes progressively larger-scale fire tests beginning at the cell level and progressing to the module level, unit level, and finally the installation level. The tests are designed to evaluate the risk of thermal runaway and fire propagation in battery energy storage systems.
Most lithium-ion technologies generate flames during the UL 9540A test at the cell level. For instance, a punctuated lithium-ion cell will catch fire and for this reason manufacturers are adding additional protection around cells to contain thermal runaway at the module level and meet testing criteria.
EnerVenue’s Energy Storage Vessels completed UL 9540A testing at the cell level with no flames observed during induced thermal runaway.
“Our UL 9540A test results confirm our proven battery chemistry as the leading option for customers concerned with eliminating the possibility of fires or thermal hazards at their grid-scale installations,” said Majid Keshavarz, EnerVenue's CTO.
Since its metal-hydrogen batteries require no additional packaging or modification to prevent explosion or fire propagation, EnerVenue claims that its customers are able to reduce project risk, OPEX costs, risk to personnel, and environmental concerns.
In another safety milestone, the company also certified its Energy Storage Vessels to UL 1973. The safety standard applies to stationary batteries and certifies the ability of a battery system to safely operate under normal and abnormal conditions relative to electrical, mechanical, and environmental safety.
“UL 1973 confirms and validates our safety claims and satisfies a requirement for the deployment of grid-scale and commercial energy storage systems,” said Andrzej Skoskiewicz, vice president of product engineering at EnerVenue.
Established in 2020, EnerVenue claims that its nickel-hydrogen batteries have lifespans of more than 30 years through more than 30,000 cycles without experiencing degradation and therefore come with no maintenance costs. The company also claims costs per kilowatt-hour as low as a penny, as well as capital expenditure costs that beat lithium-ion batteries.
As demonstrated by its use in NASA satellites, the nickel-hydrogen battery technology is particularly good in remote and harsh conditions with operational temperature ranging between -40 C to 60 C. EnerVenue's battery has an efficiency ranging from 80 to 90%, depending on the cycle rate, and its energy density per square foot is equal to, or better than lithium-ion batteries, according to the company.
EnerVenue raised $125 million in a December 2021 Series A equity offering from Schlumberger, Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures, and Stanford University, and was advised by Barclays. The funding round followed an earlier $12 million seed round that year.
In March, the US start-up announced its plans to invest in a one-million square-foot gigafactory in the state of Kentucky, where it will design, manufacture and test its nickel-hydrogen Energy Storage Vessels.
EnerVenue reports that it has more than 7 GWh of customer commitments, including from Pine Gate Renewables, Nicon Industries’ Green Energy Renewable Solutions, and Schlumberger New Energy, among others.

While Australia remains in the top 10 for both new PV installs and total market, the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) latest Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (PVPS) report shows that there was a “pull back” last year with early estimates indicating close to 4 GW of solar was installed, down on the 5 GW deployed in 2021.
The state of the Australian PV market has been detailed in the IEA’s PVPS Annual Report 2022 which reveals that a cumulative 29.7 GW of PV and at least 3.36 million rooftop solar systems have been installed in Australia.
The IEA said Australia remains in the top 10 for both new installs and total market. Australia was ranked 9th for annual installation capacity with 3.9 GW and 6th overall for cumulative capacity.
Australia also remains in the top 10 countries with the highest PV penetration, ranking 5th with 15.7%, and ranks No.1 in the world for installed solar per capita with 1,166 watts per person. Australia leads the way from the Netherlands, with 1,040 watts installed PV capacity per person and Germany with 807 watts per person.
While still showing strong volumes, the report notes that PV installations in Australia contracted slightly in 2022, dropping 1.1 GW on the 5 GW installed in 2021.
The IEA attributed the contraction to supply chain issues and investment lags and said it expected these issues to be resolved in 2023, suggesting the market landscape in Australia is paving the way for an increased rollout of rooftop solar, particularly commercial PV deployment.
“The economic fundamentals for residential and commercial PV are outstanding,” the agency said. “Australia’s high electricity prices and inexpensive PV systems means payback can commonly be achieved in 3-5 years.”
“2023 is expected to see stability in rooftop solar – with some growth in commercial and industrial installations.”
The IEA’s positive outlook comes in spite of its latest report showing that the average price for a residential solar PV system increased in 2022 to more than AUD1.10 ($0.74) per W after subsidies, or about AUD1.55 per W on average without a subsidy. In 2021, the average price for a residential system was less than AUD1 per W after subsidies, or about AUD1.50 per W without subsidies.
The report also reveals that the average system size in the sub-100 kW market grew further to over 9 kW per system in 2022, a trend the IEA said “reflects both the growth in commercial installations, and the growth in the typical size of residential systems, as householders prepare their homes for future addition of batteries and electric vehicles.”
While the IEA is upbeat about the rooftop solar sector, it said the residential storage market also remained strong with more than 19,000 new batteries installed with small-scale solar systems in 2022, increasing the total number of batteries installed to upwards of 60,000 by the end of the year.
The IEA said the Australian storage market remains “favorably viewed” by overseas battery and inverter manufacturers due to its high electricity prices, low feed-in tariffs, excellent solar resource, and the large uptake of residential PV.
The IEA said interest in large-scale solar also remains strong. The agency said although investors continue to have to navigate “regulatory challenges and transmission limitations”, 1.7 GW of new larger-scale solar was added to the systems in 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/04/sunpower-secures-550-million-loan-purchase-commitment/,"FINANCE,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 4, 2023",SunPower secures $550 million loan purchase commitment,"From pv magazine USA
SunPower, a residential solar and energy services provider, announced it has secured a $550 million loan purchase commitment from private equity firm KKR & Co. Credit funds and accounts managed by KKR will purchase solar loans made to SunPower customers.
“Residential solar is a key area of focus for our Asset-Based Finance business,” said Avi Korn, managing director of KKR’s credit group.
SunPower’s loan programs offer residential customers 25-year terms to secure a more predictable cost for electricity when compared with volatile utility rates. The company launched SunPower Financial in 2021, and its loan business grew 99% year-over-year in 2022. With a SunPower project, installation, design, sales, financing and warranty are all provided by one entity.
“With the closing of this transaction, we have raised sufficient capital year-to-date to fund a total of $1 billion of incremental solar loans for SunPower’s customers.  As demand continues to rise, we expect this additional capital will power our loan bookings volume into 2024 and enable SunPower to increase access to the benefits of solar for more homeowners,” said Guthrie Dundas, Sunpower's interim chief financial officer.
The $550 million commitment follows a $450 million commitment from April 12 provided by HASI and Crédit Agricole CIB, two leading climate and sustainability investors.  Both credit agreements are non-recourse financings. 
Business activities
In late April 2023, SunPower announced it partnered with OhmConnect to offer its customers the opportunity to participate in virtual power plant (VPP) programs.
Homeowners in select California markets that have the mySunPower app can earn rewards for managing electricity use, particularly during times of peak electricity demand on the grid, when utility bill rates are the highest. The service helps balance the electricity grid while offering solar and energy storage customers an opportunity to derive value from their system.
SunPower has continued to evolve its customer offerings over the last year. In September 2022, the company introduced two new batteries for residential energy storage applications. The two devices, called SV-BASE13-C and SV-BASE19.5-C, respectively are part of the company’s Sunvault energy storage series. The battery comes in five configurations: 13 kWh, 19.5 kWh, 26 kWh, 39 kWh and 52 kWh.
Also in September 2022, SunPower announced it partnered with retailer giant IKEA to offer its solutions in select California IKEA stores.  Members of the IKEA Family customer loyalty program will have in-store access to four custom-designed SunPower solar packages, which all include a SunPower Equinox solar system, a 25-year warranty for power, product and labor, and a 10-year monitoring warranty. IKEA U.S. customers will work directly with SunPower to access its energy solutions, which contain all the products, services, and warranties that customers will need.
Last May, the company released SunPower One, a holistic energy management system designed to interface with home solar arrays, battery energy storage systems, as well as the full set of energy loads in the home, including heating and cooling, appliances, lighting, and more.
The platform takes a step beyond monitoring the system, proactively advising homeowners on ways to optimize their energy usage. It is capable of recognizing patterns of electricity consumption and suggests further actions for energy bill savings.
