The system, which is currently in the conceptual stage, aims to use up to 40% of solar heat for green fuel generation – a significant improvement from previous systems, which only achieved a 7% utilization rate.
“The increase in efficiency could drive down the system’s overall cost, making solar thermochemical hydrogen (STCH) a potentially scalable, affordable option to help decarbonize the transportation industry,” the scientists said. “It is a big step toward realizing solar-made fuels.”
Similar to other STCH designs, the conceptual system can be built around an existing CSP plant, absorbing the receiver’s heat and directing it to split water and produce hydrogen. However, there is a novel two-step thermochemical reaction at the heart of the new system.
“In the first step, water in the form of steam is exposed to a metal. This causes the metal to grab oxygen from steam, leaving hydrogen behind,” the scientists said. “Once hydrogen is separated, the oxidized (or rusted) metal is reheated in a vacuum, which acts to reverse the rusting process and regenerate the metal. With the oxygen removed, the metal can be cooled and exposed to steam again to produce more hydrogen. This process can be repeated hundreds of times.”
The efficiency of this process is related to its train-like design, with box-shaped reactors running on a circular track. Each reactor in the train would house the metal repeatedly going through different thermochemical stations.
“Each reactor would first pass through a hot station, where it would be exposed to the sun’s heat at temperatures of up to 1,500 C. This extreme heat would effectively pull oxygen out of a reactor’s metal,” the group said. “That metal would then be in a ‘reduced' state – ready to grab oxygen from steam. For this to happen, the reactor would move to a cooler station at temperatures around 1,000 C, where it would be exposed to steam to produce hydrogen.”
Another improvement in the system is its ability to recover most of the heat used in the process. It does so by allowing reactors on opposite sides of the circular train-like track to exchange heat through thermal radiation. In addition, a second set of reactors circle around the first train, moving in the opposite direction and operating in cooler temperatures. This allows the evacuation of oxygen from the hotter inner train, without the need for energy-consuming mechanical pumps.
“When fully implemented, this system would be housed in a little building in the middle of a solar field,” said researcher Aniket Patankar. “Inside the building, there could be one or more trains each having about 50 reactors. And we think this could be a modular system, where you can add reactors to a conveyor belt, to scale up hydrogen production.”
The research team said it will build a prototype of the system in the coming year.
“We’re thinking of hydrogen as the fuel of the future, and there’s a need to generate it cheaply and at scale,” said the study’s lead author, Ahmed Ghoniem.

SECI has started accepting bids to set up 1 GW of solar projects on a build-own-operate basis in India. The projects can be located anywhere in India, as long as they are connected to the interstate transmission system (ISTS).
SECI will sign 25-year power purchase agreements (PPA) with the developers selected through the tender. Power procured by SECI from the projects will be sold to different buying entities in India.
“Bidders who have already commissioned solar PV plants/storage plants or are in the process of constructing such plants and have untied capacity may also participate,” said the tender document. “In such case, they will be given the benefit of a longer period of PPA, commensurate to the duration between the actual date of commencement of supply of power and scheduled commencement of supply date.”
A single developer can bid for contracted capacity ranging from 50 MW to 500 MW, in increments of 10 MW. The maximum capacity that can be allocated to a single bidder is 500 MW. The responsibilities of the developer include identifying suitable land, project installation, project ownership, obtaining the necessary approvals, and establishing interconnection with the ISTS network to supply power to SECI.

Spanish company nTeaser has launched a new online platform to help investors to buy wind and solar projects from renewable energy developers in Spain.
“We have already published co-developments for almost 2 GW of projects in Spain, which has generated a lot of interest from investors and has received a few good offers, and we will soon publish another 100 MW storage project from another developer, also in co-development,” nTeaser's founder, Carmen Izquierdo, told pv magazine. “We are in talks with other developers to upload their smaller, but more advanced battery projects.”
The solar projects to be included in the platform have capacities ranging from 5 MW to 10 MW. Izquierdo said that a developer with substantial experience in wind power is currently seeking a financial partner for the 2 GW storage project.
“We believe that the batteries are going to hit hard. Although there is still little visibility, the big ones are already positioning themselves well,” said Izquierdo.
Large funds with international operations and significant independent power producers experienced in PV development have primarily used the nTeaser platform, she said.

The manufacturer said the thermal storage system can be used in combination with its heat pumps. “Compared to a traditional hot water boiler, the thermal battery is up to four times smaller,” it said in a statement.
Triple Solar sells the new product in three different sizes. The smallest battery measures 640 mm x 365 mm x 575 mm and weighs 136 kg. It features a heat loss rate of 0.67 kWh/day and its capacity is 167 l.
The medium-sized device has a size of 870 mm x 365 mm x 575 mm, a weight of 187 kg and a capacity of 217 l. It has a heat loss rate of 0.77 kWh/day. The largest product has dimensions of 1,050 mm x 365 mm x 575 mm and weighs in at 233 kg. Its capacity is 333 l and it has a heat loss rate of 0.84 kWh/day.
All products operate at a maximum pressure of 10 bars and can reportedly provide hot water at temperatures ranging from 45C to 55 C, with minimum heat source temperature ranging between 65 C and 80 C.
“Households and their homes are becoming smaller and smaller. As a result, there is often no room for a large boiler,” said the company's COO, Cees Mager. “The thermal battery is so compact that it even fits in a kitchen cupboard.”
Triple Solar began selling the new thermal battery on October 12. The Dutch company also manufactures heat pumps and photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) panels.

Called TOPAZ P1/P2/P3, the new laser system can be equipped with a wide range of laser sources, including nanosecond, picosecond, and femtosecond lasers in the infrared, green or ultraviolet wavelength ranges from can be done from either the substrate-side or from the film-side. The company claims a throughput of greater than 10,000 substrates per day with 10-second cycle times for 300 scribe lines.
The working area is said to go up 2,400 mm x 1,300 mm, supporting substrate thickness in the range of 2 mm to 4 mm. “Customers can, of course, request specific dimensions within the working area range,” Benjamin Bopp, sales director at 4JET, told pv magazine.
The system has a laser sub-system design featuring “individual path tracking,” which Bopp said is related to the other features, such as individual auto-focus, and individual power-balancing for every single processing beam.
“In other concepts, there is only one sensor for a multitude of laser beams, for example, which causes inaccuracies by design. The laser beams from the source are split into multiple laser beams in the processing head. Since beam splitting is never perfect in real life, this leads to uneven power distribution, and therefore uneven scribing results,” said Bopp.
The laser units each have their own sensors, power level settings, and focus optics. These features result in more precise measurement and a higher number of measurement points, according to Bopp, which in turn means more precise, consistent scribing, and the potential to reduce unproductive areas between scribing lines, te so-called dead zones.
According to the manufacturer, the system design has also the benefit of being able to bring the scribes closer together without increasing the risk of crossing, which leads to fewer inaccuracies in terms of focus position, and fade out lines, especially at the edges of the modules.
The new solution has a power requirement of 400Vac, 63 A and a factory-floor footprint of 7,500 mm³ x 5,650 mm³ x 2,300 mm³, including peripherals.
First customers are using the new systems in pilot line production with several systems on order for mass production purposes, according to Bopp.

Wavr developed its first prototypes for consumers, such as boat owners. The company claims that the system is particularly suitable for water surfaces with weak waves, as its modular design is able to increase the required power output by integrating more systems in an array configuration.
The technology can be used in low-power marine data buoys and internet of things (IoT) devices, according to the company, which claims its technology has no intermittency issues found in some other renewable energy technologies.
“The system is also designed to be scaled up and integrated with other renewable energy technologies,” the company said, noting that future prototypes may also be combined with photovoltaic panels installed on top of the floaters, small wind turbines, mini-hydropower systems or other tidal energy technologies.

“We feel the hybrid unit with solar panels is the next most important prototype for us. We are currently developing it with a group called Infrgy,” the company's founder, Clyde Igarashi, told pv magazine. “We’re using conventional PV panels rated at IP68 to handle conditions out at sea. The panels are placed directly on top of the WEC modules and cables are protected by rubber seals. Micro inverters under the panels are used to synchronize with the frequency and amplitude of our wave energy converter.”
The standalone system is made of 3D-printed plastic and has a weight of 4.5 kg. It embeds an internal battery to store energy and is linkable to external batteries, the manufacturer said. It features a power output of 3 W per square foot (0.09 m2).
“After we perfect the hybrid Wavr with solar panels, the next step would be to link arrays together,” Igarashi said. “Currently we are targeting a price of around $2,300, which would include five 40 W solar panels. The 200 W solar system with inverter accounts for approximately $800 of the cost.”
He also stated that the price should decrease significantly with scale. “We haven’t yet done an LCOE calculation for any specific location,” he added.
Wavr is based in Mililani, Honolulu County, Hawaii.

CleanCo, a Queensland government-owned energy company, wants to add 3 GW of clean energy capacity to support the Australian state’s renewable energy targets, which aim for 50% by 2030, rising to 70% by 2032 and 80% by 2035.
CleanCo Chief Executive Officer Tom Metcalfe said the 3 GW total includes project development acquisitions, joint venture investments, and offtake agreements.
“We’re looking for renewable energy and firming projects that will help us reach our 2030 goals and contribute to Queensland’s clean energy future,” he said.
Submissions for the 3 GW close on Nov. 17.
The Queensland government’s renewable energy targets call for an additional 22 GW of new wind and solar projects by 2035, supported by at least 12 GW of storage, firming and dispatchable technologies including grid-scale batteries and pumped hydro storage.
In June, the state government announced it would spend AUD 500 million ($316.4 million) through CleanCo “to propel the development of large-scale solar and wind projects” in central Queensland.
In September, CleanCo released an expression of interest seeking up to 400 MW of renewable generation and storage projects to support the development of its Swanbank Clean Energy Hub near Ipswich, Queensland.
CleanCo has also been given funding to install a 250 MW/500 MWh big battery at the Swanbank energy precinct.

The Renewable Energy India Expo 2023 – held last week in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh – was much bigger and more crowded than last year’s event. The organizers of the show told pv magazine that the event recorded 621 exhibitors and 43,182 trade visitors. The numbers exclude the Battery Show India, which was co-located with REI Expo 2023 for the first time in India and showcased over 200 brands to more than 8,000 visitors.
Most of the solar PV manufacturers showcased their offerings in the latest n-type technologies. It is now clear that n-type TOPCon is going to take the driver’s seat for the Indian PV manufacturing sector.
“Currently, n-type TOPCon modules cost INR 1-2/W more than mono PERC, but as the technology advances, their price is bound to come down. Also, TOPCon allows for BOS cost savings of up to 3.26% while offering up to 5% increase in power output,” Shubhra Mohanka, director at Gautam Solar, told pv magazine. “So, if you consider all these factors, the user is going to benefit from the use of TOPCon.”
All major module manufacturers in India are embracing the shift from p-type to n-type technology, with TOPCon emerging as their preferred choice.
“Many of the leading cell manufacturers in China have already started producing TOPCon cells,” said Vikas Arya, AVP-product strategy and marketing for solar at Jakson Group. “This development is expected to narrow the price gap between M10 p-type and TOPCon technologies by the end of 2023 or early 2024.”
Manufacturers of mono PERC solar cells that aim to meet TOPCon demand can modify or upgrade their current production lines to adapt to the rising number of busbars from 10 BB in p-type to 16 BB in TOPCon. According to Arya, some Chinese cell manufacturers offer TOPCon cells with a 10BB configuration, providing a cost-effective short-term solution for adapting existing 10BB mono PERC lines.
“It is essential to plan for the upgrade of machines from 10BB to 16BB in collaboration with machine suppliers, ensuring preparedness as the market transitions from mono PERC to TOPCon technology in 2024-25,” Arya said.
A Pixon representative said that if Indian manufacturers do not upgrade their production lines to adopt advanced technologies such as TOPCon, they c0uld lose the opportunity to emerge as a viable alternative.
“After three months, more than 50% of the module production globally will adopt TOPCon. Going with the flow, Goldi Solar is expanding its TOPCon-ready PV module capacity to 4 GW with the addition of 1 GW of new production lines,” said Bharat Bhut, co-founder and director of Goldi Solar.
Most HJT manufacturers at the show said that HJT adoption could take a bit longer [than TOPCon] due to its more complex manufacturing process and higher costs.
“The efficiency of TOPCon modules is somewhere around 24.5%, whereas HJT offers 24.5% to 25%,” said Bhut. “There is only half a per cent difference in efficiency between the two technologies but the costs involved with HJT is very high.”
Adani, with a goal of achieving 10 GW of MG silica-to-PV module manufacturing capacity in India by 2027, presented its Elan Shine series of bifacial TOPCon modules, boasting efficiency of up to 22.4%. In addition to Adani, Waaree also featured TOPCon and HJT products at the event, such as a 715 Wp dual-glass bifacial HJT solar module and a 720 Wp TOPCon panel.
“The overall trend in Indian PV manufacturing has been shifting away from polycrystalline to monocrystalline solar modules, especially considering the fact that ALMM limits on minimum solar module efficiency mean even small project developers are shifting to monocrystalline modules. In monocrystalline module technologies, n-type TOPCon has seen a significant uptake recently with many significant players [including us] showcasing n-type TOPCon modules at REI 2023,” said Gautam Mohanka, CEO of Gautam Solar. “These modules provide greater efficiencies than mono PERC modules, which still remains the most preferred technology. But this will gradually change in the near future as many manufacturers are increasing their manufacturing capacity to increase the production of n-type TOPCon modules to meet the growing market demand.”

Boundary Power, a union between West Australian regional utility Horizon Power and Victoria-based electric engineering company Ampcontrol, has officially launched a standalone power system (SAPS) that uses solar power and a renewable hydrogen hydride battery to store and generate electricity when required.
Adam Champion, business development manager for renewables at Ampcontrol, said while the Hydrogen Integrated Stand-Alone Power System (HiSAP), is not yet commercially available, it has been created to explore technical factors across design, integration and operation.
“We will be using these learnings as input into our future renewable energy products,” he said.
The first of the HiSAPS, developed in conjunction with Sydney-based hydrogen energy storage system specialist Lavo and Melbourne-headquartered inverter manufacturer Selectronic Australia, has been installed at Ampcontrol’s LED manufacturing facility at Ringwood in Victoria.
Boundary Power General Manager Simon Duggan said the system uses the company’s Solar Qube, an integrated, foldout, solar-battery-generator combination. However, the traditional diesel generator has been swapped out for a self-contained hydrogen power system developed by Lavo.
“Through the collaboration with Lavo and Selectronic we’ve been able to come up with a uniquely designed solution that paves the way for what we can do in the future with standalone powers systems and renewable energy generation,” he said. “It allows us to demonstrate the capabilities of this Solar Qube unit being powered by a hydrogen electrolyser and storage system rather than using your traditional diesel generator. This is a really, really, really exciting time.”
The demonstration unit includes two systems. The standalone SAPS comprises a 4 kWp rack-mounted solar array, a 16 kWh battery energy storage system and a 7.5 kW inverter. This is coupled with a 20 kWh metal hydride hydrogen energy storage system (HESS) with an additional 6 kWp solar array (part of a rooftop array at the Ringwood facility) and 5 kWh of battery storage. The HESS also incorporates its own 2.3 kW electrolyser and 3 kW fuel cell to ensure all hydrogen used is renewably created on site.
“One of the unique things about the HiSAPS unit compared to standard stand-alone power systems is that it generates its own fuel internally,” Ampcontrol Research Engineer Thomas Steigler said. “It’s generating hydrogen and storing that within the unit.”
The entire system, including communications equipment for integration into metering and reporting systems, is contained within a weatherproof enclosure.
The newly unveiled demonstration unit will supply solar power to Ampcontrol’s Ringwood facility during daylight hours to meet daytime energy demand. Excess energy will be used to charge the battery energy storage system (BESS) and then the HESS. The BESS will be discharged to meet the power demand at night and during peak periods. The HESS will meet energy demand gaps where solar and BESS energy are not available.
The October issue of pv magazine turns the spotlight back onto agrivoltaics. We’ll consider how solar on farmland is taking root in Australia and South Africa, how agrivoltaic data harvesting could help more farmers take the plunge, and how an insistence on expensive minimum heights for agrivoltaic panels is hindering the technology in Italy.
The project was partly funded by the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (DEECA) Victoria as part of the state government’s Renewable Hydrogen Commercialisation Pathways Fund.
Duggan said the project has offered an insight into the technology required to build hydrogen systems to store and provide electricity and the demonstration plant will provide crucial insight into the technical, regulatory and safety aspects of integrating hydrogen systems into a standalone power system.
“The funding allowed us to collaborate with experts in the field to design an innovative solution to demonstrate real-world application, paving the way for future commercialisation of HiSAPS,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/16/solar-panel-waste-is-not-a-significant-problem/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 16, 2023",Solar panel waste is not a significant problem,"The fastest energy change in history is underway. New solar PV generation capacity is being deployed faster than everything else put together. The price of PV continues to fall, and PV is essentially unconstrained. Thus, solar PV is growing to dominate not just electricity production, but also all forms of energy production, via the electrification of nearly everything.
Typical electricity consumption in advanced economies is 7-12 MWh per person per year. This will need to double to accommodate the electrification of transport, heating and industry. In some countries, additional electricity will be required to decarbonize the chemical industry: metals, ammonia, plastics, synthetic jet fuel, etc. Most of this electricity will come from solar, with limited support from wind and hydro.
For illustrative purposes, we can take an average per capita solar electricity generation of 20 MWh per year in an affluent fully decarbonized country. Assuming a typical DC capacity factor of 16% (rooftop and ground-mounted), then each person needs 15 kW of solar panels with an area of about 70 m2.
The panel lifetime is 20-30 years, and so about 3 m2 of solar panel waste per person per year is generated, with a mass of about 30 kg. This is small compared with the solid municipal waste stream in the USA of about 900 kg per person per year, and very small compared with CO2-equivalent emissions in the USA of 19,000 kg per person per year.
The aluminum frame and electrical cables of retiring solar panels are normally recovered because of their value.
Most of the rest of the panel is glass, which is not toxic and the raw materials of which are inexhaustible. The mass of glass in 3 m2 of solar panel is about 20 kg. This compares with the current US glass waste stream of 30 kg per person per year. Thus, if entirely discarded as landfill, solar panels would increase the glass waste stream, by two thirds, which is significant but far from overwhelming. The high quality of discarded low-iron solar glass may find specialist applications, including as starting material for new generations of solar panels, and in the road sign paint industry.
The solar panels also contain about 1.2 kg of silicon which is a non-toxic and extremely abundant material (n. 2 in the Earth’s crust). The balance of the panel comprises thin layers of protective plastic and a small mass of conductive metals such as copper (Cu), aluminum (Al) and silver (Ag) that may be recovered and recycled, depending on sufficient volumes to justify investments in recycling equipment.
A growing market in developing countries is the reuse, or second life, of solar panels. Many utility-scale solar power plants are replacing their 15% efficient panels with 22% efficient bifacial double-glass panels. The same trucks that deliver the new panels take back the retiring panels, which are then sorted and sent for a second life in low-power applications elsewhere.
During the early growth of an industry, the logistics to deal with retiring products might not initially keep up. This currently applies to both lithium batteries and solar panels. However, the pace of adoption of both technologies means that this will change quickly. The mature lead-acid battery industry provides a good example of high collection rates.
As the PV industry grows and matures, businesses will develop for sustainably managing end-of-life solar panels. The amount of PV materials to be recycled will remain comfortably below existing waste and recycling streams and hence no special disposal and recycling technology or logistics is required. Managing retiring solar panels will not be a limitation on the replacement of fossil fuels by solar.
Importantly, the 3 m2 of solar panels per person that is recycled each year has generated 20 MWh of electricity over its lifetime and displaced 20 tonnes of CO2 emissions. This is about 1000 times larger than the waste in the panels, and its avoidance is a spectacular environmental gain.
The waste stream of a wind turbine is similarly small compared with the CO2 displaced during its lifetime. Images of retiring turbine blades and solar panels being buried that periodically circulate on the web in shock articles fail to point out the 1000 larger mass of CO2 emissions that the turbines and panels have avoided.

The first of three Origis Energy projects that combine 550 MW of solar and 150 MW of energy storage have begun construction in Mississippi. The projects are expected to deliver electricity to customers in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) service territory.
Golden Triangle I is a 200 MWac project with 50 MW of battery storage, expected to be completed in summer 2024. Golden Triangle II, a 150 MWac project containing 50 MW of battery storage, is planned to be completed in spring 2024. These projects are located in Lowndes County, Mississippi.
The third phase is called Optimist, and this 200 MWac project with 50 MW battery storage is located in Clay County and has a projected completion date of mid-2025.
The utility-scale battery storage for each site is provided by Mitsubishi Power Americas.
About 1.5 million solar modules will be installed on the sites, which are expected to generate the equivalent electricity of the demand of 126,000 homes.
Oirigis Energy is the developer, construction firm, and operator of the solar and storage assets. The projects will deliver electricity to TVA via power purchase agreements.
“Projects like these, ensure we can continue to provide affordable, reliable, resilient and sustainable energy to fuel the region’s economic growth,” said Jeremy Fisher, senior vice president commercial energy solutions with TVA.
Over $106 million in near-term economic benefits are expected due to construction and job creation. Over the life of the project, an estimated $145 million in regional economic benefits are expected to be generated.
“Our office has worked continually with both TVA and Origis through all phases of this project. These investments provide a unique diversification to our tax base and upon completion provide additional tax revenue to the counties and the schools,” said Joe Max Higgins, chief executive officer, Golden Triangle Development Link.
 RES is providing construction services to Origis for the portfolio, employing about 300 people over the course of the three projects. Upon completion, Origis Energy will employ about 9 on-site jobs over the 35+ years expected life of the projects.
