https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/20/photovoltaic-sanitary-water-heater-from-belgium/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BELGIUM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 20, 2022",Photovoltaic sanitary water heater from Belgium,"Belgian startup Wanit has developed a solar water heater that purportedly reduces the cost of domestic hot water by 85%. The PV water heater solution includes a main dual tank and a solar connector that links the tank with a rooftop PV system and residential battery.
The solar connector relies on maximal power point tracking, which ensures that the maximum output from the solar array is always captured, claimed Wanit. 
“According to the power demand, the connector converts the electricity to the right voltage with no loss and conveys it to the main boiler, the satellite boiler or the batteries,” Christian Bayet, the company's founder, told pv magazine.
The solution can be installed vertically or horizontally and is available in four versions: a 65-liter water heater for off-grid applications, an 80-liter device for off-grid applications, and two on-grid heaters with capacities of 65 liters and 80 liters. The smallest water heater measures 1,066 mm x 275 mm x 506 mm and weighs in at 28.4 kg. The largest solution measures 1,251 mm x 275 mm x 506 mm and weighs 32.3 kg.
“We offer different versions depending on the size of the household, the available space and the number of panels that can be placed,” Bayet said. “The 65-liter product is suitable for smaller households, with very little space, and the 80-liter is more suitable for larger households. But the main difference between the two models, the DC (off-grid) and the Hybrid, is that the second has two additional heating rods that are connected to the grid at 230 V.”
Bayet said the DC model is suitable for those who wants to add the system to their heating system, as would people who opt for thermosolar systems.
“The hybrid model is a compact boiler where everything is integrated. When the free heated water reserve is exhausted, the boiler can heat, according to different programs, all or part of the tanks and thus ensure to cover the need for hot water at any time, while maintaining all the capacity to store the free energy production of the panels,” he explained.
The system heat storage capacity ranges from 5.9 kWh to 7.2 kWh, with all devices relying on two dry heating rods and IP22-rated protection. They also all feature DC power of 1,300 W.
“Every watt installed gives benefits but we recommend at least 400 W per person. For a household of four people, the ideal configuration is four new generation PV panels and a hybrid boiler of 80 liters, and batteries to offer more storage and more flexibility,” Bayet said.

The solar connector operates with a maximum input current of 20 A, a minimum PV voltage of 60 V, and a maximum system voltage of 200 V. Its efficiency is 97.5% and it can be connected to up to 1,700 W which can be done with four solar modules.
“For less powerful PV panels, depending on their characteristics, a six-panel configuration is also possible,” Bayet said. An internal sensor regulates the charging voltage according to the room temperature. “With an external sensor, as an option, adaptation is carried out continuously,” he added.
For the SolarConnector, the 80-liter Hybrid boiler, and four PV panels, the price is around €4,000 ($4,230), installation costs included. 
“This is an additional cost of €3,000 compared to a classic electrical boiler,” Bayet said. “The payback of this difference will be delivered after four to six years, depending on the local electricity tariffs.” Additionally, the company can offer batteries at less than €1,000 for a storage capacity of 3.2 kWh.
Wanit currently has operations in Brussels and Tournai, Belgium.
“We serve zones located 100 km around these two cities, North of France included, and we are planning to reach other cities before our products can be available anywhere in Europe and in the world,” said Bayet, noting that it is handling assembly at an unspecified location in Belgium. “We are working every day to improve our producing capacity in order to meet the demand.”

The European Commission said it will roll out carbon contracts for difference to support the uptake of green hydrogen by industry. It will also offer specific financing for REPowerEU under the Innovation Fund, along with two delegated acts on the definition and production of renewable hydrogen. The commission's president, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the European executive body is assessing state aid for hydrogen projects as a priority, while also working on EU financing schemes.
BP and German chemical producer Linde have announced plans to advance a major carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in Texas to enable “low-carbon hydrogen” production at Linde's existing facilities. “Upon completion, the project will capture and store CO2 from Linde's hydrogen production facilities in the greater Houston area – and potentially from its other Texas facilities – to produce low carbon hydrogen for the region,” said BP. “The low-carbon hydrogen will be sold to customers along Linde's hydrogen pipeline network under long-term contracts to enable production of low-carbon chemicals and fuels.” 
The Africa Green Hydrogen Alliance has kicked off in Kenya, South Africa, Namibia, Egypt, Morocco, and Mauritania. It aims to make the continent a frontrunner in the development of green hydrogen. The countries “intend to foster collaboration on creating a sustainable enabling environment to supercharge green hydrogen development,” according to a press release.
Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners has proposed the construction of an artificial island dedicated to the large-scale production of green hydrogen from offshore wind in the Danish part of the North Sea. “The island is expected to be able to supply an unprecedented amount of green hydrogen by 2030 and will thus be a crucial step in securing Europe's future green energy supply,” said the Danish fund manager.
The Danish Energy Agency said that it will set up a new secretariat this summer to assist the authorities and project developers in creating an overview of regulatory treatment and approval processes, while monitoring the development of Power-to-X products in Denmark. 
The UK government has announced up to GBP 60 million ($74.9 million) of government funds to develop hydrogen. The funding has been awarded to 28 projects across the United Kingdom. ITM Power is set to receive more than GBP 9.2 million to build a next-generation 5 MW electrolyzer stack. 
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Technical University of Munich have designed a new kind of glucose fuel cell that converts glucose directly into electricity. “The device is smaller than other proposed glucose fuel cells, measuring just 400 nanometers thick,” said MIT. The fuel cell could be incorporated into a medical implant.
Hydroplane will showcase its work on modular hydrogen fuel cell power plants for aviation and mobile energy storage at the 2022 European Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition (EBACE2022) from May 23 to May 25.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/20/the-mobility-revolution-nissan-mitsubishi-launch-mini-evs-for-japan/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"MAY 20, 2022","The mobility rEVolution: Nissan, Mitsubishi launch mini EVs for Japan","Once leaders in the Japanese EV market, legacy carmakers Nissan and Mitsubishi are now searching for ways to secure their share in the face of growing competition from fast-growing newcomers such as Tesla. On Friday, the two car manufacturers have unveiled their first jointly developed new Kei, or mini EV, looking to lower production costs and expand their offerings of this type of light vehicle unique to the Japanese market.
Limited to 3.4 meters in length, 1.48 meters in width and 2.0 meters in height, mini vehicles are said to account for 40% of the Japanese market. “Under planning and development management by NMKV, a joint venture of Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, the Kei EV has not only integrated Nissan’s advanced technologies with Mitsubishi Motors’ expertise in manufacturing Kei cars, but also the two companies’ combined electrification technologies,” the companies said in a statement. The new car will be sold under their respective brand names. Nissan will offer its first light EV, the Sakura, starting at about JPY 1.78 million ($13,891) after factoring in a government subsidy, and with a range of 180 km. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Motors will release the “eK cross EV” starting from JPY 1.85 million, including the subsidy, also with a range of 180 km. Both automakers said they would start selling their new line-up of electric Kei cars this summer.
But even as they expand their EV portfolios and up the ante on new battery technologies, Japanese carmakers are found to be the least prepared for a zero-emissions vehicle transition compared with their global competitors, according to research released this week from climate think tank InfluenceMap.
The three biggest Japanese manufacturers – Toyota, Nissan and Honda are the biggest laggards, followed by South Korea’s Hyundai and General Motors in the US. According to the study, which is based on IHS Markit’s forecasts to 2029, just 14% of Toyota’s worldwide production is expected to be battery-electric vehicles, rising to 18% for Honda and 22% for Nissan. The study also found that Tesla and Mercedes-Benz are the only firms out of 12 big manufacturers which are on course to shift to zero-emissions vehicles in line with climate goals.
With zero emissions transport key to the world’s decarbonization efforts, the International Energy Agency has calculated that 57.5% of global car sales must be zero-emission vehicles by 2030 if global heating is to be limited to only 1.5 C.
However, an extensive, reliable, and convenient fast-charging network is critical for large-scale EV adoption and as the global EV market continues to grow, the rollout of charging infrastructure can’t happen quickly enough. As of this month, EV drivers in Hong Kong will have access to the region's first ultra-rapid charging station compatible with different EV brands.
The station, deployed by Shell Hong Kong Limited, Sino Group and Halo Energy Limited provides four rapid DC chargers, including one that operates at 300 kW, meaning that an EV can be fully charged within 15 minutes to provide 200 km of range. According to the project proponents, this makes it the fastest EV charger of its kind in Hong Kong. The three companies had previously worked to establish their first EV station in the town of Fanling.
Meanwhile, in Europe, Tesla has continued to expand its Non-Tesla Supercharger pilot. As announced this week, drivers of non-Tesla EVs may now use the company’s formerly proprietary fast-charging network in Austria, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, and the UK. The pilot was already live in France, Norway, and the Netherlands. Tesla has been gradually expanding the pilot to monitor the impact of onboarding non-Tesla EVs on its network, but its goal is to open the entire network in Europe and worldwide. Of course, pricing for non-Tesla drivers reflects additional costs incurred to support charging a broad range of vehicles and adjustments to its sites to accommodate these vehicles. Rates vary by site, and charging prices can be seen in the Tesla app. The per kWh price to charge can be lowered with a charging membership.
Against the backdrop of battery material supply chain crunches, automakers continue to search for ways to secure scalable and sustainable material supplies. BMW Group‘s venture capital unit for investing in fast-growing technology start-ups, BMW i Ventures has become the lead investor in Mangrove Lithium, a Canadian company that has developed a process to transform both new and recycled raw lithium into battery-grade material. Mangrove Lithium’s technology is said to eliminate the need for a carbonate plant, reducing the operating costs and time associated with the initial conversion of feedstock into lithium carbonate.
According to the company, the resulting material could be used in any type of lithium-ion battery. For BMW, the investment may prove critical for its further expansion. “There is a substantial need for technologies that enable more environmentally-friendly and cost-effective lithium production, as lithium is a key component in most battery chemistries relevant for EVs,” said Kasper Sage, Managing Partner at BMW i Ventures. The funds from the Series A-1 financing round will be used to accelerate the construction of Mangrove Lithium’s first commercial plant.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/20/ebrd-wants-transparent-pv-supply-chain-excludes-some-chinese-manufacturers-from-financing/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"MAY 20, 2022",EBRD due diligence efforts highlight importance of supply chain transparency,"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has compiled a list of Chinese PV module manufacturers, which pv magazine has seen, over which questions have been raised about their supply chains – with respect to the use of forced labor. The list is likely a part of the EBRD’s due diligence measures and demonstrates the high level of scrutiny under which solar supply chains are coming. Asier Ukar, managing director of PI Berlin Spain, takes a look at where the industry is headed in keeping supply chains free from accusations of forced labor.
pv magazine: Investors and buyers of solar modules want to ensure that the products they purchase and their suppliers comply with strict environmental, social and governance policies. Legislation in the United States and concern in the European Union about supply chain traceability have put additional pressure on buyers. It is suspected that forced labor may be used in the production of polysilicon. Can reliable monitoring be carried out?
Ukar: So far, traceability upstream to include silicon wafers, polysilicon, and metallurgical silicon (MSG) has generally not been well developed or implemented. According to PI Berlin's first supply chain traceability audits, most manufacturers' silicon supply chain traceability systems only relate to cells and modules. PI Berlin has been conducting supply traceability audits to ensure consistency throughout the supply chain. At this time, the main focus of the audits is on the manufacture of polysilicon in certain regions of China.
What exactly is evaluated?
The manufacturer's ability to obtain, maintain, and document material transactions in the supply chain, including purchase orders, invoices, and bills of lading related to traceable materials and their links to raw material suppliers. They are asked about their systems for data collection, record management and retention, monitoring reports and monitoring request management. The audit is carried out by reviewing the documentation and verification at the factory and meeting with the personnel of the manufacturer's purchasing department.
In that sense, PI Berlin has developed a supply chain traceability audit that assesses the maturity of the PV module manufacturer in terms of supply chain traceability policies, systems, processes and compliance. Manufacturers are asked to share their policies, objectives, methodology, and scope for supply chain traceability management. The main focus of the questionnaire sent to manufacturers is the sourcing of polysilicon, where the greatest concerns regarding the protection of human rights have been raised.
Does this mean we have to rely on what the manufacturer says?
With the above evaluation, the buyer can assess the manufacturer's ability to trace the origin and production of the silicon used in the modules it purchases. Depending on the capacity of the manufacturers, their influence in the supply chain and their willingness to cooperate with the audit, the buyer may understand where the polysilicon in the modules comes from and be able to independently verify it. The degree of cooperation of manufacturers with the audit and the current status of their traceability system already offer valuable information to know if the manufacturer should be considered a reliable supplier.
The main challenges hindering PI Berlin's ability to execute traceability audits and generate tangible results to date have been mainly related to the unwillingness of manufacturers to offer transparency in their supply chain, the fear of receiving a bad result audit when supply chain traceability systems are still immature. So far this year, two projects have been paralyzed by the client, once it has received our results. This demonstrates that auditing the origin of polysilicon is not just a formality, and that certain agents take their internal code of conduct very seriously.
Aren't these audit reports confidential?
The common approach taken by buyers in all sectors to address these issues is audits of their supplies. As for the PV industry, the sensitive nature of these audits can lead to balancing multiple financial, political and social interests. Ideally, the buyer receives a statement from the auditor verifying, based on tests, that the products comply with the legislation and their own policies. However, limitations on the auditor such as access, confidentiality and policy, whether internal or from an independent third party, may reduce their ability to provide evidence-based conclusions. In any case, if the results are positive, that is, if we can prove that the supply chain is clean, the manufacturer will be the first to try to make it visible.
What does the audit cover? Are all manufacturers evaluated with the same criteria?
The audit provides a qualitative assessment of the scope, strength and maturity of a traceability system. The manufacturer is evaluated based on its ability to provide supply chain traceability documentation that is consistent and compliant with the current guidelines and requirements of its relevant jurisdiction. We do not make distinctions between manufacturers, we evaluate large and small manufacturers in the same way.
Developers are concerned about project delays if modules are seized by US customs, border and protection authorities, as has happened several times in the past year. Is there any way to minimize risks? What does Europe plan to do?
The United States has already passed legislation enacting a Sale Retention Order (WRO) on modules containing materials from certain Chinese metallurgy and polysilicon manufacturers. The European Union is preparing its own directive. The EU Sustainability Due Diligence Directive is due to be published in 2023 and will require Member States to implement national legislation obliging companies to integrate policies focused on human rights and the environmental impact of the supply chain. Germany has already passed legislation that will gradually impose requirements on companies starting in 2023.
On the other hand, an independent audit report cannot guarantee that the manufacturer will not be subject to seizure of the merchandise in the US or in other countries where there are import restrictions related to the origin of the materials of the modules. The ability to initiate this type of audit work is subject to the customer obtaining the manufacturer's consent to be audited, the manufacturer's continued cooperation, and Chinese anti-foreign sanctions laws. This may affect PI Berlin's ability to carry out this work.
Is there any way to know which manufacturers can be more transparent?
Supply chain traceability is a new requirement for manufacturers and many are continually creating or improving their traceability systems, together with their suppliers. The more vertically integrated the manufacturer, the greater its ability to trace its products. Also, the larger the manufacturer, the greater its ability to apply commercial leverage to obtain the level of traceability a client wants or needs. Some manufacturers are also in the process of changing and reorganizing their supply chains to avoid potentially restricted or non-compliant materials and suppliers.
To what extent is this fulfilled today? What should a developer take into account?
Most manufacturers are still unable or unwilling to offer full transparency in their supply chains to the level that buyers are asking for, but this is evolving. For their part, buyers of equipment for photovoltaic plants will have to address supply chain traceability issues in the future, both to comply with their own policies and with those of existing or planned legislation in their countries. A combination of independent audits and specific clauses in supply agreements can help buyers assess risks and identify strategies to address them.
It is strongly recommended that traceability requirements and independent audits are integrated early in the purchasing processes, as part of the qualification and tender processes for manufacturers, rather than waiting for the requirements to be executed. Based on the audit results and the cooperation of the manufacturers, buyers will be in a better position to determine if they should consider the manufacturer as a suitable supplier for their future PV projects.
This article was corrected on 23.05.2022 to reflect feedback received from the ERBD that it has not published nor compiled a blacklist of Chinese PV manufacturers and since there is no blacklist, there is also no deadline of May 23, as originally published. The EBRD says it carries out thorough due diligence processes before undertaking any project, and this would include taking account of any published information relevant to the potential project.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/20/novel-mounting-structure-for-pv-systems-on-thermoplastic-polyolefin-roofs/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 20, 2022",Novel mounting structure for PV systems on thermoplastic polyolefin roofs,"Mibet, a Chinese mounting system supplier, has developed a new mounting structure for PV systems on flat metal rooftops. 
The MRac TPO Roof Mounting Structure System can be applied to trapezoidal flat metal rooftops via a thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) waterproof membrane.
“This membrane has a lifecycle of over 25 years and ensures remarkable waterproofing, insulation and fireproofing performance,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The new product is tailor-made for TPO flexible roofing, mainly to solve the problem of fixtures that cannot be directly installed on color steel tiles. The system's components are made of stainless steel and aluminum alloy, providing a perfect match between TPO fixing supports and trapezoidal metal rooftops. It includes a rail, two clamp kits, a support kit, the TPO roof fixing support and a TPO cover plate.

The system can be installed in two different configurations. With the first one, the system is laid on the TPO waterproofing membrane, and the base body and the waterproofing membranes are pierced and fixed on the roof with self-tapping screws.
“The self-tapping screws need to be properly locked with the color steel tiles at the bottom of the roof,” the spokesperson said.
The TPO insert can then be screwed down, after tearing off the butyl rubber protective film, into the base body. An M12 flange nut is used to fix the screw and the TPO insert to prevent the screw from spinning. A connector and a square tube can then be placed onto the ProH90 special with self-tapping screws. The PV panels are fixed with side pressure blocks and medium pressure blocks. 
Through the second installation option, the system is laid on the TPO waterproofing membrane, and the base body and the waterproofing membrane are pierced and fixed on the roof through self-tapping screws. The self-tapping screws need to be properly locked with the color steel tiles at the bottom of the rooftop. The remaining operations are the same as those in the first installation configuration.
The system has a wind load of 60 meters per second and a snow load of 1.6 kilotons per square meter. It is applicable to either frameless or framed solar panels.
With the mounting system, the PV module can be placed onto the color steel tile substrate with self-tapping screws and fit the high-sealing inserts with TPO roofing, said Mibet said. This means that the TPO roof mounting can perfectly connect with the roof.
“Such a structure can ensure the intensity and stability of the PV system, and effectively prevent the risk of water penetration on the roof due to installation,” the spokesperson explained.
Mibet offers a 10-year product warranty for the MRac TPO Roof Mounting Structure System.

The new factories will serve the company's own solar power projects under development in the country. Thus far, it has a combined capacity of 1.2 GW in Romani, with more projects expected to come online in 2024.
“Using the financial sources of the European The Recovery and Resiliance Facility (RFF), Astrasun plans to build and operate an ingot wafer, a solar cell and a photovoltaic module factory in Romania in cooperation with European Solar Manufacturer Council in South Romania,” the company said.
The new production will be located in the region of Turnu Măgurele and will include a 1.8 wafer manufacturing facility, a 1.5 GW solar cell production unit, and a 1.2 GW module factory. Astrasun said it will invest €102 million ($107.9 million) in the wafer factory, €110 million in the cell facility, and €55 million in the panel factory. Overall, more than 800 people will be employed across the three facilities.
According to Mihai Balan, executive director of the Romanian Photovoltaic Industry Association (RPIA), the eastern European country may soon host several renewables-related factories.
“The RPIA and RWEA [the Romanian Wind Energy Association] have set-up the RESinvest initiative, aimed at developing a robust domestic renewable energy supply chain, for which Romania already has funding available through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan [NRRP] and the Modernisation Fund,” Balan told pv magazine in March.
The Romanian NRRP – drafted to secure a slice of the €750 billion made available by the European Union to help member states recover from the pandemic – foresees the development of solar cell and panel value chains. Total annual production capacities are expected to reach at least 200 MW by 2025.
US-based Enphase recently announced that it will begin producing micro-inverters in Timisoara, Romania, from the first quarter of 2023.

“Xlinks will speed up the UK’s transition to net zero by laying four 3,800km-long subsea cables to connect a huge renewable energy farm in the Moroccan desert with Devon in South West England,” Octopus Energy said. “The site will supply 3.6 GW of reliable, clean power to the UK for an average of 20 hours a day, enough green energy to power about 7 million heat pumps all year round.”
The Xlinks project is expected to sell power at GBP 48 ($59.7)/MWh.
“The partnership is helmed by a team of energy experts and business entrepreneurs, including Chairman Sir Dave Lewis, CEO Simon Morrish and Project Director Nigel Williams who oversaw North Sea Link, the world’s longest subsea interconnector linking the UK and Norway, delivering it on time and under budget,” said Octopus Energy.
Octopus Energy claims to be the fourth-largest energy company in the United Kingdom. It is also one of the largest investors in renewable energy in Europe.
Xlinks CEO Simon Morrish revealed the details of the ambitious project in an interview with pv magazine in April 2021. He said the huge complex would be connected to the UK power network in Alverdiscott, Devon and Pembroke, Wales, via a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line. This will include four separate cables and will be the longest subsea power transmission link in the world. The company plans to sell the power to the UK grid under a contract for difference (CfD) scheme.
The cable would cross international waters and dip into the territorial waters of European countries such as Portugal, Spain and France.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has warned that some LG-branded batteries, equipped with cells from specific production lots manufactured between March 2017 and September 2018, could overheat and catch fire.
South Korea’s LG Energy Solution issued a recall in February 2021 for an estimated 7,200 of the affected batteries. They were primarily installed in LG, SolaX or Opal branded home energy storage systems.
LG has said it will replace all affected batteries free of charge, but the ACCC said about 6,400 of the affected batteries have not yet been replaced. It is concerned these consumers may not be aware of the recall and the fire risk. The consumer watchdog has said since October 2019 that the potentially dangerous batteries have been linked to nine fires in Australia and five in the United States, causing property damage and injuries to two people.
“We encourage consumers to urgently check if they have an LG, Solax or Opal solar energy storage battery which is included in the recall by LG,” said ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard. “These batteries have already caused injury and fire damage to properties and could lead to serious injuries or death.”
Rickard said the ACCC has been working with state and territory electricity regulators to raise awareness of the recall. Licensed electrical contractors who have installed or worked on systems with affected batteries are also encouraged to proactively contact these clients about the recall.
“Consumers who identify they have an LG energy storage battery under recall are urged to immediately contact LG to discuss next steps, including a free replacement when available,” she said. “The affected batteries have also been supplied in solar energy storage systems with brand names other than LG, so it is extremely important to check if you have a battery affected by the recall by checking the serial number on the LG website.”
Western Australian Commissioner for Consumer Protection Gary Newcombe said the owners of the affected batteries should act quickly.
“Product recalls are sometimes met with apathy, but this is not the time to hesitate or delay,” he said. “Immediate action needs to be taken before the fire risk results in damage to your home or potentially an injury or death. I urge owners of LG solar batteries in their home to check the model numbers on their units and treat this issue with the utmost urgency.”
The recalled batteries were available for sale at various times between April 2017 and December 2019. The affected models are RESU3.3, RESU6.5, RESU10, RESU13, RESU7H Type-R, RESU10H Type-C, RESU10H Type-R, RESU10H Type-R (Secondary), S/A Gen2 1P (EM048063P3S4) and S/A Gen2 2P (EM048126P3S7).
Electrical regulators recommend switching off the battery. If consumers wish to switch off the battery, they should refer to the instruction manual of their energy storage system or contact the installer or manufacturer for advice.

Achieving the US government’s decarbonization goals of 100% carbon-free electricity generation by 2035 and net-zero economy-wide carbon emissions by 2050 will require the deployment of record levels of renewable technologies. The most common solar technologies deployed to date are crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride (CdTe), the costs of which have dropped markedly in recent years. The US Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) said in order to meet 2035 targets, solar deployment has to double in the next three years, and ultimately ramp up to 100 GW by 2035.
While most development will use silicon and CdTe, SETO sees potential in nascent technologies like halide perovskites.
SETO finds that the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of halide perovskites (over 25% in single-junction cells and over 29% in tandem cells with silicon) show promise. One advantage of perovskites is that they can be easily manufactured in high volume. However, significant technological challenges must be addressed before perovskites are ready for commercial power sector markets.
In a recent Energy Focus report, SETO covers the critical technical barriers, the commercialization pitfalls and opportunities, and efforts to overcome barriers and challenges to commercialization. It also references SETO-funded projects, which can be viewed in the Solar Energy Research Database.
One of the major barriers is cost. In order for perovskite to be commercially competitive, its levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) must be competitive with that of other technologies. And with the cost of silicon and CdTe modules dropping while warranty times are increasing, it will be a steep challenge for perovskite to compete on an LCOE basis.
“As researchers continue to develop perovskites, there are lessons to be learned from the fates of other photovoltaic technologies. SETO is focused on helping perovskite photovoltaic companies to avoid those pitfalls and spurring innovation in order to get this technology market-ready and accelerate the deployment of solar energy,” said Dr. Lenny Tinker, photovoltaics program manager, Solar Energy Technologies Office, US Department of Energy.
Module and cell durability
Durability is the largest technological risk for perovskite PV. For LCOE metrics to approach SETO’s 2030 goals of $0.02 kWh, perovskite PV will have to last at least 20 years in the field, which will require improving its ability to withstand various environmental conditions. Much testing is required, yet today’s tests are geared toward commercialized PV technologies (Si, CdTe, etc.) and are unlikely to capture all the failure modes relevant to perovskite modules in the field.
Existing tests may also be excessive or promote irrelevant or uncharacteristic modes of perovskite device failure. SETO has published some minimum durability performance targets which, if realized, would provide strong evidence that a prototype perovskite PV device is ready to enter an initial production stage. To this end, SETO funds considerable perovskite durability work as well as development of test standards.
Efficiency, often considered a strength of perovskite PV, requires significant improvement for large-area devices before they are ready for the commercial arena. While standardized cell and module form factors have yet to be finalized for perovskite PV, standards will be a crucial prerequisite to scaling the entire industry beyond initial demonstration projects.
To encourage industry standardization and communication, SETO is promoting collaboration among academia, the national laboratories, and industry – intended to bring diverse perspectives and expertise to bear on common problems, accelerate cycles of learning, and facilitate transfers of knowledge and skills. Industry consortia like PACT and the US Manufacturing of Advanced Perovskites (MAP) consortium allow companies to connect and share best practices within this industry.
The final major technical hurdle to commercialization is achieving high production yield, with narrow distributions in module efficiencies. Barriers related to process control and manufacturing yield are often underappreciated, and perovskite solar cells have not yet demonstrated broad process flexibility in the lab. Cost-effective deposition processes will need to tolerate small variations in factors such as deposition tooling conditions, deposition environment, and ink compositions.
SETO has emphasized process control in perovskite projects across its portfolio, ensuring that changes in performance or efficiency are statistically significant and robust from a process standpoint, while funding the development of processes which, when scaled up, might be easier to control.
The ability of perovskite PV technologies to secure investor financing with low interest rates, may be even more significant than the technical challenges to perovskite PV commercialization.
Financing will be necessary for scaled manufacturing lines and deployment projects. Bankability is directly related to the confidence financers have that (1) the technical challenges have been solved, (2) the financed assets will perform long enough to deliver a desired return on investment, and (3) the liability of product failure and warranty claims is low. Ensuring bankability and durability standards are met is a SETO priority.
Future opportunity
These challenges faced by perovskite technology makes it uncertain as to if and when it can achieve gigawatt-scale deployment. In the meantime, there are many different applications that can support higher dollar-per-watt costs and durability issues including transportation, building integrated PV, military operations, aerospace, and Internet of Things. Substantial capital will be needed to scale the perovskite industry, which will come only once investors and financiers have confidence in the profitability of perovskite manufacturers and the long-term durability of perovskite module technologies.
Sustainable growth of the perovskite industry depends on avoiding these pitfalls and requires patient and careful investment that corresponds with the timeline and magnitude of progress needed to adopt this technology into products.
SETO has supported a wide range of perovskite startups in various stages of development, through different programs, as SETO can support sustainable investment in the perovskite PV space by providing nondilutive capital to promising early-stage commercial entities. Startups further along in the product development cycle and closer to pilot manufacturing are encouraged to apply for funding through SETO’s Incubator program.
Overall, the opportunities for perovskites as a solar technology are great. It has the potential to develop into a high-efficiency, low-cost module technology for commercial power sector deployment, with throughput rates and energy payback times superior to state-of-the-art PV technologies. SETO calls for members of the perovskite community increase device size, demonstrate relevant outdoor durability, and make processes robust in order to tap the potential of perovskite in the solar energy sector.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/20/evonik-unveils-new-additive-portfolio-to-improve-wafer-cutting/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"MAY 20, 2022",Evonik unveils new additive portfolio to improve wafer cutting,"From pv magazine Germany
German chemicals producer Evonik Industries has launched a new processing additive portfolio for solar wafer cutting.
The new Tego Surten E product is designed to improve the performance of solar wafer cutting. Evonik wanted to publicly present its new product at the SNEC in Shanghai, which has now been postponed to the end of the year due to the pandemic in China.
According to the manufacturer, the new additive series can achieve a significantly better cut quality ratio at higher cutting speeds and smaller wire diameters on large wafers (M12), resulting in cheaper post-processing work for sliced wafers. Increasing the power when cutting the wafers leads to better overall performance and production efficiency of the solar modules, said the company.
Conventional cutting fluids with standard surfactants do not meet the requirements of the latest high-performance cutting process. Products developed with these fluids show deep cut lines and divots, which are caused by ineffective swarf transport and degradation of the wire's diamond coating. This lowers wafer quality and can also lead to the formation of large crystals during the subsequent diffusion step, which ultimately reduces cell efficiency.
The wetting agents and defoamers in Tego Surten E contain the right balance of extremely low dynamic surface tension and adhesion tendency to effectively remove cutting chips.
“These low-dose additives can significantly improve the quality and speed of cutting photovoltaic wafers and thus contribute to another step on the way to a climate-neutral future,” said Benjamin Brehmer, global segment manager energy and storage for Evonik’s interface and performance business line.
Module manufacturers could also use the additive portfolio in many emerging PV applications. For example, it could be used to support more uniform and improved anti-reflective and reflective coatings, as well as other engineered surface modifications that improve the overall energy output of solar applications.
