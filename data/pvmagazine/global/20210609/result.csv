The renewables company today said the five-year bond would be offered on the Warsaw Stock Exchange via Polish lender Mbank, which is owned by partially state-owned German financier Commerzbank.
A press release issued by the solar company – which operates in Italy, Portugal and Spain as well as its domestic market – said the proceeds of the green bond series will be used to buy and develop solar plants in Europe.
Quoted in the company statement, R.Power chief executive and co-founder Przemek Pięta said the business was particularly seeking ‘ready-to-build' PV projects.
“As one of the most experienced solar farm developers in Poland, we believe that we have the experience and resources needed to deliver projects across Europe,” said Pięta. “The funds raised will allow us to build our own portfolio of generation assets from both our own development as well as M&A [merger and acquisition] transactions.”
R.Power claims to have a solar development pipeline of more than 4 GWp in Poland.

SDE++ continues to be the main driver for planned and contracted PV capacity in the country. The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy said this week that it selected 3,426 PV projects with a combined capacity of 3,535 MW in the second round of its 2020 program. About 1,803 MW of the total will be deployed in 1,120 rooftop PV projects, while ground-mounted and floating PV plants will account for another 1,732 MW of capacity.
The state-run RijkSdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO) agency, which manages the subsidy program, has allocated 4,406 MW of renewable energy capacity through the bidding round. The remainder was represented by a 302 MW carbon capture project, 310 MW of electric water heaters, 107 MW of large-scale wind capacity, and 39 MW of biomass projects.
The government devoted a budget of €4.46 billion to the procurement round, with about €.197 billion going to PV technology. Most of the funds – €2.12 billion – went to a CO2 capture project that an international consortium plans to build at the Port of Rotterdam.
In the previous round of the SDE++ program, the Dutch authorities selected 6,882 PV projects with a combined capacity of 3,340 MW.
The Netherlands could reach between 38 GW and 125 GW of total installed solar capacity by 2050, according to a recent report by Netbeheer Nederland. By the end of December, the country’s cumulative installed solar capacity hit 10 GW. New PV capacity for 2020 was around 2.93 GW.
By comparison, newly deployed PV systems hit 2.57 GW in 2019, 1.69 GW in 2018, and 853 MW in 2017. Of the new capacity installed last year, around 1.09 GW came in the form of residential installations – up from 873 MW a year earlier. The remaining 1.8 GW came from the commercial and industrial and large-scale market segments.

A report by five international NGOs into the progress of the various aspects of sustainable development goal (SDG) seven has warned efforts will have to be ramped up to achieve global access to electricity for all, and the universal availability of clean cooking facilities appears an even more unrealistic ambition.
The economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic across the world's poorest nations has seen up to 30 million people in sub-Saharan Africa lose access to electricity because they can no longer afford it, according to the authors of the latest edition of the Tracking SDG7 report.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
The study – published on Monday by the International Energy Agency (IEA), International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), World Bank, World Health Organization and the UN‘s Statistics Division – said the electricity access rate across sub-Saharan Africa will have to more than double, to 85 million people per year this decade, to provide power to an estimated 940 million by 2030 and ensure no-one is without electricity.
Solar plays a central role in hitting the SDG7 ambition, with IRENA noting 11 million people had access to renewables mini-grids in 2019 and global trade body GOGLA – formerly the Global Off-Grid Lighting Association – having reported 105 million people had access to non-grid solar devices, 49% of them in sub-Saharan Africa and 29% in South Asia.
With SDG7 also requiring the electrification effort to contribute to global renewables deployment and energy efficiency gains, the annual study for the first time included a survey of the flows of public money into developing nations for the development of clean energy.
Some $14 billion was supplied to developing nations in 2018 in the form of grants, loans, equity investments and risk mitigation instruments, such as financial guarantees, with the figure having fallen from the record $21.9 billion of public funds reported in 2017. Of the $14 billion figure for 2018, the report stated, only $2.8 billion went to the world's 46 least developed countries.
The continuing renewables dominance of hydropower – despite the advances made by solar and wind in the last decade – was demonstrated by the fact the annual fall in public funding was largely accounted for by a 61% reduction in hydro-linked finance, itself mostly related to the $5.2 billion allocated to the Mambilla hydro project in Nigeria in 2017.
With public funding for clean power increasingly aiming to trigger private investment, the document's authors noted public money is moving towards non-generation uses, such as green bonds and battery and grid spending, reflecting an attitude renewables project backing can be left to private entities.
In terms of where the money was spent in 2018, east and Southeast Asia was the only region to see an annual uplift, from $1.8 billion to $2.5 billion, mainly thanks to geothermal investment in Indonesia, the Philippines and China.
Solar and wind spending in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh has seen central and South Asia attract the most backing from 2010-18 but a fall in hydro support – from $2.2 billion in 2017 to $492 million in 2018 – saw overall renewables funding fall from $4.3 billion to $3.1 billion.
Significant investment in Latin American and Caribbean solar over a decade made way for supporting infrastructure spending in the region, as its overall figure more than halved, from $4.7 billion to $2.3 billion.
With the $122 million Trina River hydro project in the Solomon Islands having swelled developing-nation renewables investment in Oceania to a record $323 million in 2017, the figure retreated to $79 million the following year, and Africa also witnessed falls, with its sub-Saharan region falling back from $7.8 billion to $3.7 billion, mainly thanks to that Mambilla project's effect on the comparison. The $708 million Noor Mid Elt I solar hybrid project in Morocco in 2018 failed to stem a reverse in funding in the west Asia and North Africa region, from $3 billion in 2017 to $2.3 billion a year later.
The 230-page SDG7 update, which cites pv magazine among its references, said 14 of the 56 donor entities that supplied public money for renewables in developing nations in 2018 accounted for 80% of the finance offered, with the governments of Hungary and former recipient Turkey on board for the first time that year.
The German government was the most generous donor, with $2.1 billion of investment, ahead of the Export-Import Bank of China – which supplied most of a near $100 million for solar projects in Nigeria among its $1.8 billion 2018 figure – the International Finance Corp private-sector arm of the World Bank ($1.4 billion), and the Asian Development Bank ($900 million).
Those figures, however, are far short of the $1.4 trillion per year total investment the IEA estimated is required for energy spending from 2019 to 2030, to hit the SDG7 targets. The Paris-based NGO has said $30 billion per year will be required for electricity access, plus $5 billion for clean cooking provision. Some $550 billion per year should be spent on clean power generation and $495 billion annually on energy efficiency, the IEA has estimated, along with $150 billion per year on grid and infrastructure and $140 billion on ‘end-use renewables,' such as heat pumps.
IRENA's number-crunchers have called for $60 trillion to be spent transforming the global energy system from 2016-30, including more than $11 trillion worth of fossil fuels and nuclear. The Abu Dhabi-headquartered body has said $29 trillion will be needed for energy efficiency, $9 trillion for clean power generation, $8 trillion for grid upgrades and $2 trillion for ‘renewables direct use and supply', including hydrogen.
The NGO has called for $10 trillion of that total $60 trillion figure to be diverted from fossil fuel budgets into low carbon spending and has said the current post-Covid recovery phase – up to 2023 – will have to bring the first $2 trillion installment.
With the SDG7 report indicating steep shortfalls in the required rate of energy efficiency improvements and the electrification of heating and transport, the clean cooking outlook appears to be furthest from its United Nations ambition. The study said half of the world's 20 nations with the lowest proportion of access to clean cooking for their population were in sub-Saharan Africa, with only one in every 100 Madagascans and Ugandans able to use such facilities.

And they aren’t short of options, with sodium, aluminum, oxygen and many more all showing strong potential for development in storage solutions. Calcium has attracted some recent attention among these, ticking all the boxes in terms of performance potential, safety, abundance and low-cost production. However, calcium-ion storage remains in the earlier stages of research, and there are still plenty of challenges in the way of demonstrating a viable calcium-ion battery.
Among these challenges are short cycle life and low capacity, as well as a tendency for big changes in volume as the battery cycles, leading to structural damage. A group of scientists led by Seoul National University in South Korea applied knowledge gained from its research into sodium batteries to these problems, fabricating a calcium-ion battery with a cathode made from NVPF, a material that has proven successful in sodium-ion batteries. “A large calcium ion intercalation in the host is supposed to cause an extended volume change of the host, which triggers a premature degradation of the cathode structure,” the researchers explain. “The discovery of a reliable calcium cathode material or strategy that can mitigate these issues would expedite the development of the CIBs, and thus has long been awaited.”
The battery is described in full in the paper A new high-voltage calcium intercalation host for ultra-stable and high-power calcium rechargeable batteries, published in Nature Communications. Knowing that NVPF showed very low volume change during cycling in a sodium battery, the group saw that it had strong potential in calcium as well. The battery demonstrated reversible intercalation of calcium ions at 3.2 volts, and a capacity fade rate of 0.02% per cycle, among the best recorded for a calcium-ion battery.
Analysis of the cathode at work revealed that it relies on a new type of intercalation, which helps to unlock more of calcium’s storage potential. The group hopes that its discovery will clear the way for more improvements in CIB technology, enabling the realization of “stable and high power cathodes in CIBs.”

The perovskite layer was deposited on a stack made of compact titanium dioxide (C/TiO2) and mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) in ambient air with a two-step process assisted by air and green anti-solvent quenching. “A manufacturing process must guarantee basic requirements such as low cost, reduced waste, reliability, high throughput, excellent performance and stability of the final product,” the research co-author, Luigi Vesce, told pv magazine. “The procedure is based on a scalable blade-coating process in the air without the need for nitrogen.”
He estimated the cost for manufacturing the module at around €25 per square meter. “There are all the conditions to transfer this technology on a pilot line and then an industrial line,” he further explained. “We are currently using this methodology for several European projects and one of these is aimed at building a photovoltaic plant, which will be a further testbed.”
The module is composed of five series-connected cells with each an area of 2.01 cm² and has an aperture area of 11 cm². “We fabricated each module using a semiautomatic blade-coating machine equipped with a heated moving table, a blade coater, a syringe applicator, and a hot-air knife,” the academics specified. “The process is completely confined inside the machine box with controlled temperature and humidity, without any manual operation except for the substrate loading/unloading.”
The best performing device among those produced in the laboratory showed a power conversion efficiency of 16.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 5.59 V, a short-circuit current of 37 mA, and a fill factor of 72.5%. The module efficiency, the researchers went on to say, is not only higher than that of a similar module built through spin-coating, which achieved a 15.5% efficiency, but also only 6% smaller than that of the single small-area cells.
More details on the panel and the related manufacturing process can be found in the paper Ambient Air Blade-Coating Fabrication of Stable Triple-Cation Perovskite Solar Modules by Green Solvent Quenching, published in RRL Solar.
In March, the University of Rome Tor Vergata in Italy also presented a perovskite solar module with a total active area of 42.8 cm2 and aperture area of 50 cm2. The panel was built with 20%-efficient perovskite cells connected in 14 series and was able to retain 90% of the initial efficiency after 800 h of thermal stress at 85

After two years of development, German solar module and battery manufacturer Solarwatt has unveiled its residential storage system – the Battery flex AC-1. With this move, the company phased out its My Reserve series after many years and began, again, cooperation with German car manufacturer BMW, which has been the main shareholder in Solarwatt for several years.
The new battery will be available from autumn, initially as a single-phase, AC-coupled device. Two more variants are to follow next year, one for coupling to a hybrid inverter, and a complete solution with an integrated hybrid inverter. The DC solution previously developed by Solarwatt is initially not part of the planned Battery flex portfolio. However, Solarwatt leaves open the option of integrating this topology into the product family at a later date.
All three storage products included in the new series should look the same. They consist of a basic electronic module on which several battery modules – each with a usable capacity of 2.4 kWh – can be stacked, and which ends with a top battery module. The power unit can later be ordered as a suitable hybrid or battery inverter, or for coupling to a hybrid inverter.
During a demonstration by Olaf Wollersheim, managing director of Solarwatt, stacking and connecting the 25kg battery modules only took a few seconds because the connections on the top and bottom were very easy to perform. Before doing this, however, it is necessary to assemble the wall bracket and to put the electronics module into operation. Each battery module comes with a piece of the wall bracket in the package, which is then also connected as a plug-in system to a fixed column. The column has a rail profile in which the battery modules are hung and can be lowered. The electronics module is located on the floor and its cover can be removed. The connection cables for the connection to the power grid, the internet and the current sensor, are plugged in there.
In addition to the controller area network (CAN bus) connection, there is also an RS485 interface for hybrid inverters. The list of compatible hybrid inverters will probably only be available when the hybrid version is released. With the interface, several systems can also be parallelized as a cluster, explained Wollersheim. This could be used, for example, to operate several of the single-phase AC systems on different phases in parallel. The entire battery tower can be mounted either hanging it on the wall or standing on the floor.
The aluminum housing is matte black and hides handles and buttons behind flaps. In addition to the modularity and appearance, there is another aspect that might be of interest to customers. Together with BMW, Solarwatt will form a purchasing community for the components of the cell modules, which will then be assembled into battery modules in its own plant in Dresden, explained Wollersheim. He announced that BMW would ensure low purchase prices. At the same time, quality assurance should adapt to the automotive standard. BMW has made it its business to make the supply chain, from the minerals to the end product, traceable. According to its own statement, it does not use cobalt from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The smallest of the storage units has a capacity of 4.8 kWh and an output of 1.5 kW. It can be expanded to eight battery modules in steps of 2.4 kWh and has a maximum of 57.6 kWh and 6 kW of power. The system consumption in standby mode, AC & DC, when discharged, is specified as 25 W. Furthermore, heat pumps can be integrated.
The guarantee is for 10 years with a remaining capacity of 80% and Solarwatt will provide full replacement in the event of malfunction. The emergency power supply can later be retrofitted as a function, with an additional switch box.

Spain-based mounting system provider Alusín Solar has launched a new walkway to enable the transit of installers in rooftop PV projects.
Dubbed Carex, the new solution is claimed to be suitable for all installers operating in the rooftop segment but also for all those companies that have industrial equipment installed on their roofs.
“Carex was conceived to provide a professional solution to the transit of people on roofs that are not designed to be walkable,” Alusín Solar said in a statement, adding that the current solutions that are available in the market are rudimentary and artisanal. “With Carex, we have been able to respond to the need for moving [across] the roofs in a safe way for people and for the roofs themselves.”

The commercialization of the product will start on September 1. The manufacturer invested more than €500,000 to deploy a production line for its manufacturing at its facilities in Avilés, in the Spanish, northern, region of Asturias. “We hope to have it installed by the end of June and at full capacity in mid-July,” explained Alusín Solar CEO Javier Font. He added that, although the company's workforce has been trained to be able to operate with the new line, more workers will be hired shortly.
Currently, there are 32 people employed by Alusín Solar. “The product was developed in Chile, where the installation of ‘technical corridors' is mandatory for the installation of solar panels,” Font further explained. “It has not been until 2021 when we have been able to make it a reality.”

Spanish PV developer Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV), a unit of United Arab Emirates-based Abdul Latif Jameel Energy, has announced plans to participate in a new green hydrogen project.
The Professional Taxi Federation of Madrid has spearheaded the project, which will progressively replace at least 1,000 traditional taxis with hydrogen-powered vehicles by 2026. The initiative, which aims to gradually decarbonize urban public mobility, involves an investment of more than €100 million.
The first hydrogen vehicles will be put into operation in 2022. They will rely on a “taxi-as-a-service” (TaaS) business model, under which drivers will be allowed to use hydrogen-electric vehicles at competitive costs, without the need for initial outlays.
FRV will support the project by developing hydrogen production infrastructure, vehicle recharging sites, and fuel supplies for local gas supplier Madrileña Red de Gas. It will build an electrolyzer of at least 10 MW in size, powered by a 20 MW solar plant. As demand for hydrogen increases, the array can be expanded to increase its production capacity.
Toyota Spain is also participating in the initiative as a vehicle supplier. It will provide the Toyota Mirai, which has a fuel cell and an electric motor, with a range of 600 km. Grupo Ruiz, meanwhile, will provide support on issues related to urban mobility.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/09/solar-module-cooling-technique-based-on-multiple-phase-change-materials/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,IRAQ,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 9, 2021",Solar module cooling technique based on multiple phase-change materials,"Researchers from the University of Baghdad and the University of Garmian, in Iraq, and Brunel University London, in the United Kingdom, have proposed to use multiple phase-change materials (PCMs) for the passive cooling of solar modules.
PCMs are substances that absorb and release heat energy when they change phase and are able to store and release large amounts of latent heat over a defined temperature range.
The scientists specified that multiple PCMs were already used in previous research on solar panel cooling. “This requires the use of multiple PCMs, [with] various melting temperatures [and] packing them in descending order of their melting temperatures in the heat flow direction,” they explained. “However, packing PCMs in that way also enhances the melting rate, which negatively affects the potential for achieving longer thermal management duration in the PV module.”
The novel approach outlined by the British-Iraqi group, which it described as more sophisticated compared to existing techniques, consists of utilizing multiple PCMs of different thermophysical properties. This increases the storage density of the cooling system and makes it able to hold larger energy content, which in turn removes the heat generated by the PV panels. This system configuration is also claimed to allow lower melting rates and longer thermal management of the modules.
The academics utilized three PCMs known as RT26, RT35, and RT42, and decided to pack them ascendingly, depending on their melting points and the heat-flow direction, which they said deaccelerates the melting rate and reduces the weight of the cooling system as a lower amount of PCMs is needed.
The system was tested on a polycrystalline PV panel vertically connected to a multi-segment container made of aluminum and hosting multi-PCMs of different melting points. The test showed, according to the researchers, that using a higher number of multiple PCMs can increase the energy charge capacity up to 3.4% and increase the melting time by up to 18%, which in turn extended the thermal management duration by up to 33% compared to that of a single PCM. “Consequently, the PV electrical efficiency could be improved as a higher number of appropriate multiple PCMs are applied,” they asserted, noting that solar module cooling may be enhanced if the inclination angle of the system reduces the number of PCMs in use. “This also indicates that the number of multiple PCMs needs to be optimized with the PV inclination to ensure an optimal PCM-based thermal management of the PV module,” they concluded. 
The experiment was described in the study A new approach for employing multiple PCMs in the passive thermal management of photovoltaic modules, published in Solar Energy. “We didn’t examine the system experimentally and also, we didn’t do an economic analysis,” the research main author, Pouyan Talebizadehsardari, told pv magazine. Looking forward, the research team is planning to design new system configurations via employing enhancers such as nanoparticles and porous foams.

The company wants to use the funds to expand the capacity of its lithium-ion battery manufacturing site which is currently under construction in Sweden, from 40 GWh to 60 GWh.
“Including the private placement, Northvolt has now raised more than $6.5 billion in equity and debt to enable an expansion plan leading up to and beyond 150 GWh of deployed annual production capacity in Europe by 2030,” the battery maker said in a statement. “In addition, Northvolt has, to date, secured in excess of $27 billion worth of contracts from key customers including BMW, Fluence, Scania and Volkswagen, to support its plan, which also includes establishing recycling capabilities to enable 50% of all its raw material requirements to be sourced from recycled batteries by 2030.”
The Northvolt Ett fab, in Skellefteå, Sweden, aims to start producing batteries this year.
In addition to the Swedish gigafactory, Volkswagen and Northvolt are planning a 50/50 joint venture to establish another, 20 GWh battery cell factory in Salzgitter in Lower Saxony, Germany. Furthermore, Northvolt is planning to build a production facility in Gdansk, in northern Poland. The start of production is planned for 2022 with an initial output of five gigawatt-hours and, at a later stage, the capacity could be raised to 12 GWh.

Local government officials reported a fire broke out at Hoshine's ‘997 siloxane' packaging facility at around noon yesterday.
pv magazine learned the accident was under control by 10.40 p.m., local time, last night after five fire-fighting units arrived at the scene.
pv magazine’s  UP Initiative is examining, this quarter, what solar and energy storage companies can do to lead by positive example when it comes to the workers, often far removed, involved in the production of their products and services. Supply chain traceability and polysilicon provenance are key topics.
Hoshine this morning said the incident had occurred at a unit which had a trial production line under operation and no casualties occurred as a result of the fire and explosion. The unit affected produced organic silicone, rather than the metal or powder silicon also fabricated by Hoshine and which is the raw material used by polysilicon manufacturers.
Local government environment department staff tested air conditions around the factory and found no toxic or otherwise harmful gas pollution at the scene, officials said last night.
The cause of the accident was said to be under investigation.
Sources said nearby businesses evacuated non-essential staff around half an hour after the fire started, with several nearby blocks subsequently sealed off by traffic control personnel.
Hoshine Silicon's LinkedIn page describes the polysilicon producer as “the largest silicon metal producer in the world with its own coal and thermoelectricity.”
In 2019, the company’s output of silicon metal reached 560,000 metric tons and accounted for around 26% of the Chinese market and almost 17% of the global supply.
The factory unit affected by the fire is one of Hoshine's two major manufacturing bases and an independent source claimed the explosion occurred in the 200,000-metric-ton-annual-capacity second phase of the production complex, with an adjacent, 390,000MT silicon metal facility still operating at normal output.
Although Hoshine this morning stressed its silicon metal production had not been affected by the incident, solar manufacturers already seeing input costs rise as a result of a polysilicon shortage, will be concerned at the potential closure of the fab for safety inspections, as it feeds downstream silicon manufacturers in Xinjiang including Xinte, Daqo, and GCL-Poly.
An anonymous source said: “It will be up to local government whether this accident will influence the market, [either by a] little or heav[ily].”
This copy was amended on 10/06/21 to explain the distinction between organic silicone – of the type affected by the incident in Shihezi – and inorganic silicon metal, which is the material used by polysilicon manufacturers.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/09/pv-magazine-rountables-europe-live-coverage/,,PV MAGAZINE,"UPDATED JUNE 10, 2021 9:09 AM CET",pv magazine Roundtables Europe live coverage,"Thank you for joining us for day 1 of this year's virtual pv magazine Roundtable.
Tomorrow it all happens again, and we welcome you to join the pv magazine editors live from Berlin, and the over 2,500 registrants for this year's virtual pv magazine Roundtable Europe event, on day two, with our Cornerstones 3 and 4!
Once again, for those arriving early, you can participate in our English and German-speaking networking sessions, which run from 9-10 CEST.
Jörn Hackbarth, Global Head Engineering & Construction, Sonnedix, Michael Heidenreich, Senior Sales Manager Projects, GoodWe, and Rouven Lenhart, Executive Vice President Sales & Marketing, meteocontrol joined a panel discussion on Europe's aging PV-fleet, and the challenges arising from upgrading, maintaining and revamping.
In terms of outcomes, metrics for success were discussed: the question being is more power output, longer lifetime, or lower rates of failures and higher availability, and so on.
One question posed was why revamping may not be possible or preferable in some cases.
Other elements discussed included changing inverter technologies, how strategies for revamping are more becoming coherent, and how well it translates to higher IRR. Jörn Hackbarth discussed regulatory and law changes impacting decisions, along with technical challenges, where one replacement part means upgrading other elements, with a growing chain of upgrades that show technical problems.
George Schulz, Vice President of Clean Energy, Ariel Re, examined inverter replacement for older equipment from the perspective of insurance. Replacing like-for-like is not always possible, and neither is insurance a given for limited strategic approaches.
Schulz detailed a guide to risks for “RePowering Plants” for insurers. With repowering investments, some operators can target a 10-15%  increase on 20-year IRR, and as much as 40% in installed power.
In a generic case with some specifics confidential, to repower a 10MW plant. This strategy was via replacing 275W modules to 400W Tier 1 modules, and replace obsolete inverters. Ariel Re provided underwriting on the basis of detailed repowering strategy.
Michael Heidenreich, Senior Sales Manager Projects, from GoodWe, further detailed approaches to revamps, including trying to answer the old adage: “Never change a running system.” Inverter changes must be closely considered, along with modules, cabling of both AC and DC, and much more.
Steven Xuereb, Director of Sales and Project Delivery, PI Berlin, along with assessments of backsheet failures Lucie Garreau, EMEA technical Program Manager, from DuPont tackled old asset issues.
Steven Xuereb presented two case studies on backsheet degradation.
The first case study focused on backsheet chalking and cracks in a 10MW plant in Spain, with warranty remaining. 100% of modules experienced chalking, with around 1% experiencing backsheet cracking. In a negotiated claim between plant owner and supplier, PI Berlin assisted the owner in checking a suggested option for an on-sight repair of some 1,000 modules. PI Berlin recommended rejecting this offer, and seek replacement modules, despite higher costs, due to repair process concerns.
In the second case presented by PI Berlin, a 20MW Italian project was without warranty, but only some 25% of panels had backsheet chalking, but not backsheet cracking.
PI Berlin examined the causes for chalking, and via tensile strength testing, classified high, medium, and low-risk backsheet cracking for the modules concerned. 72% were in the medium-risk class for cracking, 28% low-risk, and 0% at high-risk. This allowed the operator to reserve monies for the replacement.
Lucie Garreau from DuPont detailed that the material used in the backsheet determines the likelihood of cracking. Garreau passed on a global reliability study, showing 16% of all panels show backsheet degradation. Two-thirds are linked to cracking.
Repair advantages were also discussed. Further information, including a French case study where modules were gradually replaced, before a complete replacement was negotiated, was presented. However, repairs make sense for the majority of panels, where even cracking may not affect water ingress. And, replacements may not produce the same current as the existing panels.
DuPont's approach is to tip the balance towards repair over replacement, to fix backsheets. And with the problem expected to be 5-6GW of panels each year, or around 1% of installed capacity, which is set to grow each year. Repair must be considered for a sustainable industry to be sustainable.
In response, Steven Xuereb agreed that repair can make sense, within quality assurance checks and balances, depending on the warranty situation for modules.
The pair debated repair and replacements with questions from the audience.
Alex Roedel, Senior Director of Design and Engineering, Nextracker,
Markus Balz, Managing Director, from sbp sonne, and Gerhard Weinrebe, Director, also from sbp sonne, joined the stage for a fireside chat around due diligence with commissioning, starting with single-axis tracking.
The chat commenced around the previous issues with single-axis tracking, with the question asked if the issues are resolved, and how wind speeds, extreme winds, and wind loads, are calculated.
As the market is adapting to larger solar modules and their challenges, and the panel, led by thoughts from Alex Roedel, agreed that in extreme areas, new challenges are emerging.
In terms of adjusting designs for the future, the tracker market remains young. Markus Balz pointed out that implementing a code would be too early, and therefore safety criteria and specifications and RFQs need to be discussed between parties. However, overcompensating on the side of too much safety may make a project uncompetitive.
Alex Roedel emphasized, in response to questions about how price pressures, that low LCOE is the headline feature, but long-term operational uptime is the goal for all players. Hence, a race to the bottom on pricing shouldn't be the single focus for the industry.
In response to a final question, the panel agreed that while smaller modules may, right now, be less risky, large modules will be the future for many reasons, including overall costs.
Roberto Murgioni, Head of Technical Service & Product Management, JinkoSolar EU, presented insights into Europe's largest bifacial array and its performance guarantee.
JinkSolar supplied 204MW of its Swan bifacial modules for the Kozani project in Greece.
Murgioni first introduced the growing market trend of bifacial arrays, as a higher percentage of modules shift towards bifacial types, with technologies detailed.
Speaking specifically about the Kozani project, Murgioni discussed bifacial usage, detailing usage of real and modeled data with internal simulations, along with engaging an external third-party laboratory, to provide assurances of energy generation with the technology.
Further questions of bifacial module use, guarantees of efficiency, and how albedo and irradiance measurements and third-party expertise were all used on the Kovani project, were discussed.
Carsten Auel from Deloitte, Giulia Guidi from NextEnergy Capital, and Tanja Van den Wouwer from Encavis, joined a panel discussion to continue discussing the regulations and where new opportunities might be found.
The panelists discussed compliance and regulations for investors, across the EU and wider zones, along with EPCs, developers, O&M providers, and the full supply chain.
The idea that “not caring is not an option,” for those not interested in detailed accountability steps, simply isn't valid, and demand may fall for less rigorous projects.
Carsten Auel from Deloitte explored the EU Taxonomy Regulations, the backbone of the classification of sustainable activities and financing.
In the move from green energy to sustainable energy, the EU Taxonomy Assessment ensures new solar projects are making a substantial contribution to environmental objectives without creating issues for any other objectives, and not creating harm via labor concerns or violations of human rights.
In a fast-moving presentation, Auel also detailed financing of sustainable projects must also go through a rigorous disclosure process.
 
 
If you're enjoying this year's pv magazine Roundtables Europe, make sure you  watch out for our upcoming events. From October 27-28, we will be going online Down Under for All Energy Australia, while in the US, we are planning another virtual Roundtable this year.
More details on both events will be released soon! Until then, it's back to the studio in Berlin. Enjoy!
We're back for this afternoon's Asset Management session, with this pv magazine Roundtables Europe moving on to Due diligence: Financial, contractual and technical perspectives of an evolving industry, starting at 2pm CEST.
Things will be starting at any moment, with Marian Willuhn and Michael Fuhs your hosts and moderators across the afternoon.
First up after the break and welcome will be Carsten Auel from Deloitte, on the topic Europe's new rulebook on sustainability.
Thank you for joining this morning’s session, During the presentations, our experts revealed some of the key quality concerns in manufacturing as modules move up to larger formats.
These include:  
In most cases, manufacturers have strategies in place to address these issues on the production line, and minimize the risk of performance loss later on in the field – but as these new large modules roll out to the field, a close eye on manufacturing quality needs to be maintained. 
The impacts of new, larger, module designs go far beyond module production, as we heard in the days first panel discussion addressing implications across system design and components beyond to module itself. And of course, when it comes to quality in solar it’s not just the latest technologies stakeholders need to be aware – as is made clear in our case study.  
The presentations from all of this morning’s sessions will be available on our website shortly, and please do join us for this afternoon’s session, as the roundtable moves on to sustainable practices, due diligence and performance guarantees, and revamping/replacement of system components.
Our first Cornerstone on quality is drawing to a close. It is fantastic to see such an international spread of attendees from across the world joining the discussion.
Despite a small technical hiccup, we have heard from a range of experts on large PV module formats and the associated quality risks with this new solar technology. All presentations and a recording of the discussions will be available online soon.
If you have any burning questions to ask our speakers, make sure you join the Meet the Speaker session between 12-1 CEST.
We will also be running a series of different networking sessions in English, Spanish, German and French during this hour, before the second cornerstone on asset management kicks off!
Make sure you join the pv magazine editors live from Berlin, and the over 2,500 registrants for this year's virtual pv magazine Roundtable Europe event, which kicks off in just over one hour! If you are already up and about, you can participate in our English and German speaking networking sessions, which run from 9-10 CEST.
Between 10 and 12 CEST, you will hear from 12 experts on maintaining quality alongside rapid technological development. The emergence and deployment of large-format and high-powered modules will be discussed, with a focus on quality concerns including crystalline defects in larger wafers, cell cutting processes and spacing that can result in cracking, an increase in defects as a result of cell currents, lamination defects due to process changes, and the alignment of multi-busbars.
Methods for effective risk management will also be addressed, including questions about the number of players involved in the distribution of risk. The session will further focus on ways to effectively designate the roles of banks, insurance providers, EPCs, manufacturers, and investors.
At 2 CEST, our second session on Due diligence: Financial, contractual and technical perspectives of an evolving PV industry will commence. You will hear from another panel of 12 experts discussing questions like, are solar projects always a sustainable investment class? How can buyers be certain an asset is a lucrative investment? And how can project developers fulfill the requirements set by asset managers?
This cornerstone will bring together stakeholders that deal with PV projects from a financial, legal, and technical perspective.
Watch out for live coverage from the sessions as they happen!"

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the Borumba Dam pumped hydro project has the potential to be the Australian state’s largest pumped hydro station.
Borumba Dam has long been considered a prime location for a pumped hydro facility, with University of Queensland energy expert, Professor Simon Bartlett, identifying the site more than five years ago. Palaszczuk said her government is “prioritizing” Borumba because of its existing dam infrastructure, land access, and location within the Southern Queensland Renewable Energy Zone.
In light of the Callide power station fire and subsequent blackout in May, the project seems to have taken on new urgency. Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen Mick de Brenni said that the crisis “proved” the importance of having pumped hydro as part of a diversified energy mix.
“We were able to ramp up the Wivenhoe Hydroelectric Station to provide critical generation support and stabilise the network,” de Brenni said.
At 1 GW, Borumba would have double the generation and triple the storage of Wivenhoe, he added. The minister believes that if Borumba moves ahead, the Commonwealth should contribute to the capital costs.
“We’re talking about nation building infrastructure,” de Brenni said. “Every other state has had energy projects built by the Commonwealth – Queenslanders deserve their share.”
Queensland Treasurer Cameron Dick said the funds slated for making a business case at Borumba would include detailed engineering and design, hydrological modelling, geological testing, an assessment of environmental impacts and community consultation.
“We’re investing AUD 22 million ($17 million) to potentially unlock a multi-billion-dollar construction project that would leverage billions more in clean energy investment and support thousands of jobs,” the treasurer said.
State-owned electricity transmission company Powerlink has been tasked with undertaking the business case, “given its understanding of the electricity market and experience delivering very large infrastructure,” the Queensland government said. The business case is expected to take up to 24 months, with a submission expected in the second half of 2023.
Solar Citizens
Queensland-based community group Solar Citizens has warmly welcomed the news, calling it a “forward-thinking energy storage announcement.”
“Diversifying Queensland’s energy assets is exactly what energy experts have been calling for in the wake of the Callide C coal-fired power station fire,” said Ellen Roberts, the national director of Solar Citizens. “Queenslanders are world leaders in the uptake of rooftop solar. Renewable storage options like pumped hydro and big batteries are smart investments that soak up excess solar energy during the day, making the most of cheap solar energy and ensuring grid stability.”
In the months ahead, Powerlink will start engaging with a range of stakeholders as part of its initial works. These stakeholders include state-owned Seqwater, the Department of Environment and Science, local governments, local communities, environmental groups, and traditional owners. 
“Conservation of national parks and protected areas will be prioritised and Powerlink will be actively working with First Nations and Conservation groups to explore all options and ensure appropriate environmental offsets are identified,” the Queensland government said.
In January, GE Renewable Energy and Australian-based consortium BE Power announced plans to co-develop the 400 MW Big T pumped hydro storage project at Cressbrook Dam, near Toowoomba, southern Queensland. Likewise, Genex Power’s 250 MW Kidston Pumped Hydro Storage Project in far north Queensland is also progressing.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/09/solar-microgrid-to-offer-protection-from-fire-threats/,"MICROGRID,MINIGRID,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 9, 2021",Solar microgrid to offer protection from fire threats,"From pv magazine USA
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) has commissioned its first hybrid renewable microgrid, built and installed by BoxPower.
The microgrid is planned as a permanent replacement for overhead distribution lines and is the first in a series of planned microgrids, the utility said. PG&E said it has identified hundreds of areas that would benefit from microgrid deployment and has targeted up to 20 operational remote grid sites by the end of 2022.
The new microgrid will help to reduce the risk of wildfires, PG&E said. It will supply power to a handful of customers in a High Fire-Threat District (HFTD) outside of Yosemite National Park in Briceburg, California. Rather than having long distribution lines run through HFTD areas to pockets of isolated customers, the microgrid allows for localized electricity delivery.
This microgrid project echoes some principles of the solutions proposed by Sunrun, which has worked to build distributed grids with solar and storage for increased reliability and safety. It uses BoxPower’s SolarContainer, which provides a total PV capacity of 36.5 kW, as well as a 27.2kW/ 68.4/kWh lithium ferro phosphate storage system.
Almost 90% of the energy produced will be generated by renewable sources, with the remainder to come from two integrated propane generators. A fire suppression system will protect the hardware and the facility.
