“On June 16, trucks loaded with Trina Solar's 210mm 670 W Vertex ultra-high power modules left from the company's manufacturing center in Yancheng, in eastern China's Jiangsu province, and drove to the solar park in Dachaidan, Qinghai, in western China,” the company said in a statement. “It was the first of many such shipments, with all modules for the project on track to be delivered by the end of August, adding up to a total power output of 112 MW.”
The panels will be used for the first 100 MW phase of a 1 GW solar park under construction in the region. The entire facility will be built with Trina's 670 W Vertex products.
“In the bidding for many large-scale projects, high-power modules are a requirement in nearly 80% of them,” said the company's deputy general manager, Cao Bo. “At the just concluded SNEC, we found that more than half of the module makers participating in the exhibition already produce and offer 210 component products.”
The 670 W module, which features a conversion efficiency of 21.6%, was launched by Trina in March.
It is based on 210mm wafers, non-destructive cutting, high-density interconnection, and multi-busbar (MBB) technology. Trina estimates the module can provide a 12% drop in transportation cost and 5-7% decrease in installation cost, as a result of a reduction of the non-silicon cost of silicon wafers and cells for the upstream supply chain, and a cost reduction for trackers, pile foundations, cables and labor.

Spanish energy giant Repsol has energized the first two sections of a 126.6 MW solar park it is building in Manzanares, in Spain's central region of Castilla-La Mancha.
The two units, called Perseo Fotón I and Perseo Fotón II, have a combined capacity of 90.5 MW, while the third section – the Perseo Fotón III plant – will have a capacity of 36.1 MW and is expected to come online in the upcoming months.
The €100 million project will raise the company's installed renewable energy generation capacity in Spain over 3 GW. Through its renewable energy unit, Repsol Renovables, the Spanish group is targeting to have 4.5 GW of clean energy generation capacity in 2025.
In a separate development, U.S. e-commerce group Amazon announced it wants to develop 14 new renewable energy projects in Spain, Finland, Canada and the United States. Among them, there is a new project in Castilla-La Mancha, which will be the one with the largest capacity of those driven by Amazon in Spain to date, with an installed power of 152 MW. This project will add to the four photovoltaic projects that the company already has in Andalusia, Extremadura and Aragon. With the commissioning of this new solar plant, which is expected to come into operation in 2023, Amazon's renewable energy projects in Spain will exceed 520 MW of capacity.
The new projects bring Amazon's renewable energy capacity globally to 10 GW. With these new investments, Amazon becomes the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the United States and reaffirms its position as the largest buyer globally and in Europe.
Amazon now has a total of 232 renewable energy projects globally, of which 85 are commercial scale wind and solar projects and 147 are solar roofs on company buildings and stores spread across the world.

A new climate district is being developed in Esslingen, in the Stuttgart region of Baden-Württemberg, in southern Germany.
The urban development project is being realized on around 100,000 square meters of an old freight station on the Neckar river and its first major, intermediate step has now been achieved with the completion of over 450 apartments and several commercial spaces.
The aim is for residents to generate only one ton of CO2 per person, per year in building-related CO2 emissions for heating, cooling, lighting, domestic hot water, electricity, and individual electromobility. To achieve this, the five apartment blocks are equipped with rooftop PV systems that supply electricity to the households and the charging infrastructure. In addition, excess solar power, together with green power from the grid, will drive a 1 MW electrolyzer that can produce up to 400 kilograms of hydrogen per day. Furthermore, the heat generated by the electrolyzer is used to heat the district so that around 50% of the district's heat requirements are covered by waste heat.
This integration of hydrogen production in a residential area is, so far, unique. The green hydrogen is currently being fed into the gas network but is expected to supply industrial companies in the area via hydrogen lines. Originally it was also planned to convert it back into electricity via a block-type thermal power station and a hydrogen filling station but this was not implemented for cost reasons and due to the expected increase in traffic load. The additional heat supply is provided by a bivalent combined heat and power (CHP) unit which, according to the planner Norbert Fisch – professor for energy and building technology and managing director of the EGS-plan engineering company – is operated with bio-methane.
Fisch and the mayor of Esslingen, Jürgen Zieger, hosted an event on-site and reported, retrospectively, on the ups and downs of the project. The project was funded, with €12 million, by the Federal Ministry of Economics and the Federal Ministry of Research.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/23/overdue-subsidy-payments-force-chinese-solar-developer-to-sell-off-prized-led-business/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CHINA",MAX HALL,"JUNE 23, 2021",Overdue subsidy payments force Chinese solar developer to sell off prized LED business,"With an unpaid debt pile of US$328 million, some of which dates back to September 2019, Chinese solar developer Shunfeng International today stressed to shareholders the importance of selling off its profitable LED manufacturing operation.
pv magazine reported in April that Shunfeng was preparing to sell off its Lattice Power operation despite a 55% rise in LED-related profits providing a rare positive in its accounts for 2020.
In an update to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange today, the developer again spelled out its list of creditors to explain why its Lattice Power subsidiary should be permitted to accept an offer of RMB670 million (US$103 million) for the Lattice Power (Jiangxi) Co Ltd operation.
The proposed sale, to a Nanchang Guanggu Group Ltd business 61.54% controlled by Lattice Power director Wang Min, would generate a RMB391 million (US$60.4 million) windfall for Shunfeng, thanks to its controlling stake in the seller.
Shunfeng said it would use RMB341 million to pay off creditors. The solar developer, which ended its manufacturing operations in 2019, said it is suffering because the Chinese authorities have only paid solar subsidies due to its solar farms up to March 2018, meaning it is owed RMB1.77 billion (US$273 million) in electricity tariffs by the state.
Listing its unpaid debts, the company said it has owed Chongqing International Trust Co Ltd RMB666 million since September 2019, although it expects to sign an agreement next month to delay settlement until the end of this year.
There appears to be no resolution in sight for the HK$172 million (US$22.1 million) owed to True Bold Global Ltd since November 2019, the HK$1.15 billion (US$148 million) owed Sino Alliance since the end of 2019, nor the RMB357 million owed to investors in a 2015 convertible bond which matured in March last year. The latest Shunfeng update added: “The company has not received any demand of immediate repayment from the creditors of the company.”
The developer will also have to find RMB255 million (US$39.4 million) for investors in a 2016 convertible bond which will mature on October 25, repay HK$175 million to Rainbow Fort Investments Ltd by November 30, and settle a HK$300 million (US$38.6 million) obligation with China Minsheng Banking Corp which is due by the end of the year.
An extraordinary general meeting of the business will be held on July 13 to vote on the proposed sale of the LED business.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/23/solar-powered-seawater-desalination-unit-incorporating-pv-module-cooling/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SAUDI ARABIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 23, 2021",Solar-powered seawater desalination unit incorporating PV module cooling,"Researchers at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia have developed a photovoltaics-membrane distillation-evaporative crystallizer (PME) that is able to simultaneously produce fresh water and electricity.
“This system is especially suitable for decentralized situations such as off-grid communities, KAUST researcher Wenbin Wang told pv magazine. The team aims to apply the technology to solve the electricity and freshwater supply challenges in rural or remote regions where grid electricity and freshwater are unavailable.
Described in the study “Integrated solar-driven PV cooling and seawater desalination with zero liquid discharge,” recently published in Joule, the device consists of a multistage membrane distillation (MSMD) component that is placed on the backside of a large-area solar cell measuring  16 x 16 cm and utilizes the waste heat of the cell to drive water evaporation. “The heat is conducted to the evaporation layer via the conduction layer,” the Saudi group explained. “The generated vapor passes through the porous hydrophobic membrane and is then condensed in the condensation layer to produce fresh water.”
The PV device was mounted toward the south at a tilt of 22 degrees and was connected to a resistor. The hydrophobic membranes used in the MDMD component have a thickness of 0.1 mm and porosity of 0.86% and are described by the scientists as a crucial element for the simultaneous cooling of the PV device and a high water production rate. The PME device was able to reduce the temperature of the solar cell to between approximately 46.6° C and 47.8° C, compared to 61.2° C when the same solar cell is working alone, the scientists explained, noting that the reduced temperature resulted in a yield increase of about 8%, which in turn led to a higher freshwater production rate. 
The PME was able to produce 8.09 kg m2 of freshwater per day or 1.66 kg per square meter. The power conversion efficiency of the solar cell was found to be 13.76%, which is 2.46% more compared to the solar cell working alone in the control experiment.
The proposed system is also able to evaporate the concentrated brine produced in the process through an evaporative crystallizer, achieving zero liquid discharge. “The produced brine is stored in a container under the device as a buffering mechanism before being wicked to the evaporative crystallizer by capillary effect,” the scientists explained.
“The application of the system to standard PV arrays would depend on the packaging technology of the PV panel,” Wang told pv magazine. “For the PV panel whose backside is flat, it can be immediately integrated while for the PV panel whose backside is not flat, some new designs need to be developed.”

The plant is expected to be built by the special purpose vehicle Kima Solar with an investment of around €40 million and to be grid-connected in 2023. “The project is being planned to sell power to the Serbian South East European Power Exchange (SEEPEX) or other off-takers under a power purchase agreement,” Kima Solar's director, Nikola Stamenov, told pv magazine, adding that the project may also participate in Serbia's future renewables auctions. “Once the details of the auctions will be known, we will decide if and in what capacity we shall participate.”
With regard to the targeted levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for the project, Stamenov said his assumption was that it would be competitive with current market prices, without providing specific figures.
When built, the solar facility will be the country's first operational PV plant. More projects should materialize when the auction scheme for renewables promised by the government are put in place.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Serbia had an installed PV capacity of 29 MW at the end of 2020. Last year, only 6 MW of new PV systems were deployed in the country.

The concessional finance will be used for energy transition projects by Bangladeshi authorities including the Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL), the Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited, and the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, with the rest of the development cash to be spent on sustainable urban development; good governance; displacement and migration policy; training and sustainable growth for decent jobs; and biodiversity protection.
Moslema Naznin, deputy secretary for Bangladesh's Economic Relations Division, confirmed the agreement signed on Sunday will take the form of soft loans.
IDCOL officials have said some of the new credit line will fund rooftop and ground-mounted, grid-connected solar, and off-grid PV-powered irrigation pumps. The energy efficiency requirement will mean funds being made available for equipment in sectors such as the clothing and textiles industry.
Mahmood Malik, chief executive of IDCOL, said the government department has received more than €237 million to date from the German government, in the form of grants and loans. That figure includes the €60 million lent by development bank KfW which is driving rooftop solar in the South Asian nation, and a €20.5 million grant from the same source which is mostly going towards solar irrigation pumps and biogas projects.
Previous backing has included a grant of €37 million received by IDCOL in 2005-06 from KfW and German development agency the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, for solar home systems and biogas facilities.
With IDCOL also administering a $102 million (€85.6 million) rooftop solar loan package from the World Bank, Malik said the scale of funding provided by international donors meant the public body could consider backing ambitious projects such as a 12 MW solar rooftop project which has been proposed by unspecified entrepreneurs.
Peter Fahrenholtz, the German ambassador in Dhaka, welcomed the signing of the latest loan agreement on Sunday and said: “We are glad to continue our support for the Bangladeshi success story.”
The Bangladeshi government says the nation has 746 MW of clean power generation capacity.

Emirati energy company AMEA Power yesterday held an inauguration ceremony for its 50 MW Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed solar park at Blitta, in the center of the West African nation, and chairman Hussain Al Nowais, quoted in a press release issued by the company, said: “Togo was an obvious choice for AMEA Power’s first operational power plant in Africa, with it being an important trade hub in West Africa, along with the government’s progressive regulatory framework for renewable energy projects, which was key in ensuring the completion of the project in a fast, efficient, and responsible manner.”
AMEA, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi-based conglomerate AlNowais Investments, pointed to Togo's $8 billion, 2018-22 National Development Plan as a key factor in financing the project, with the solar park pre-funded and then refinanced, enabling work to proceed at pace on a renewables plant the developer said was completed in “record time,” without giving a context for any records broken.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
The emirati developer said construction, by an 80% Togolese workforce, was completed within 18 months of national electric company Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo signing a 25-year power purchase agreement to buy the electricity generated at the site. The tariff to be paid for the solar power generated was not specified.
The plant is 267km from the Togolese capital, Lomé, and is expected to generate more than 90 GWh of electricity per year. AMEA said 9% of the energy production will feed the local distribution network of Blitta.
With pv magazine having previously reported the project would cost XOF20 billion ($36.3 million), AMEA yesterday said finance had been supported by concessional loans from the Togo-headquartered West African Development Bank, which serves eight countries in the region, and fellow public body the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development.
The developer described the pre-funding and refinancing approach as “a unique model for a large scale IPP [independent power project] project in Africa,” and said the process was “indicative of the level of project certainty created by the [Togolese] NDP’s [National Development Plan's] regulatory framework, which provided AMEA Power with the necessary level of assurance and comfort to embark on the project’s execution well in advance of the financing being arranged.”
Under the NDP, the government is aiming for universal access to electricity this decade and for half of its power to come from clean energy sources.
With the president and prime minister of Togo in attendance at yesterday's inauguration, dignitaries were told AMEA had involved 36 engineering students from Togolese technical institutions in construction of the project, via its internship program.
Togo had just 3 MW of solar generation capacity at the end of 2020, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

A constitutional complaint against Germany’s short-sighted climate protection effort has forced policymakers to improve their plans in recent weeks. But there is a fear that in the years ahead, politicians in Germany and elsewhere will lack the creativity to present anything other than nuclear energy as the best, or only, solution that can be implemented in enough time to make a difference.
Solar is demonstrably the most economical form of energy generation.Unfortunately, we are still struggling with a shortage of materials across the board, starting with polysilicon for cell production, and precious metals, glass, and aluminum for module production. Added to this is a shortage of components for inverters, steel for substructures, and copper for cables. Freight rates from China are also rising on an almost daily basis. These factors are causing module prices and the overall cost of PV systems to skyrocket. However, a turnaround by the spring of 2022 at the latest is a realistic possibility.
German goals
Following a constitutional complaint by climate activists, including those from the Fridays For Future movement, the Federal Constitutional Court declared parts of the Climate Protection Act unconstitutional due to failure to provide sufficient emissions reductions from 2031 onwards.
According to the court ruling, future generations must not be left with a situation that restricts their freedoms and fundamental rights. The response was swift, probably with a view to the upcoming election. Instead of achieving climate neutrality by 2050, Germany is now set to be climate-neutral by 2045, and the target for greenhouse gas reduction by 2030 has been bumped up from 55% to 65%. Climate experts warn that the targets are still not enough to limit global warming to 1.5 C, yet some are already saying that all this will be far too expensive and will deal a mortal blow to Germany as a commercial location – same old story.
With the gradual decommissioning of Germany’s nuclear fleet, there has been more talk of an expected “electricity gap” that cannot be filled with renewables, only with natural gas. In any case, all reduction scenarios include some mention of greenhouse gas sequestration and storage; that is, technical or natural processes to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and permanently store it. After all, the climate law uses the misleading term “climate neutrality” and not “zero emissions” or “100% renewable energy generation.” But we are being led to believe that there are offsetting options which on closer inspection prove unrealistic. And the technical removal of carbon from the air with subsequent storage in underground reservoirs, so-called CO2 sequestration, is neither safe nor energetically feasible.
The success of the German activist legal action will probably inspire imitators around the world to file similar lawsuits. This is good, but in my opinion there is a danger that nuclear will be presented as a stopgap solution. Thankfully, a constitutional appeal would also be filed if nuclear expansion plans revive, since the radioactive waste also represents a burden imposed on future generations.
Nuclear renaissance
Even today, the reactors at Chernobyl and Fukushima are a threat. From Chernobyl, worrying incidents occur in the bowels of the containment structure created around the plant. And in Fukushima, the release of huge quantities of contaminated cooling water into the sea threatens to unleash another environmental catastrophe.
Meanwhile, sun and wind have been used to generate energy for over 30 years without major incident. When these plants are decommissioned, only valuable raw materials remain, which can be recycled increasingly well. There are some protests from those who feel inconvenienced by the close proximity of wind farms. But compared to nuclear, these are new technologies, and refinement can only make them more efficient and inconspicuous.
To take the wind out of the sails of nuclear power, we must accelerate the expansion of renewables at least twice the current speed. This means removing obstacles to onshore wind farms, and creating new incentives for private expansion. This need not, however, increase feed-in tariffs, which would only justify higher turbine prices and allow some manufacturers to maximize profits. Rather, implement more intelligent support measures such as tax breaks, scraping levies for operators, and genuine industry support for the establishment of local manufacturers. After all, if materials don’t have to be transported around the world, a lot of CO2 can be saved – and the products can be offered more cheaply to boot.

The researchers explained that this perovskite material is fabricated by combining lead(II) iodide (PbI2) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) and that the reaction between them produces FAPbI3. “But this method is far from perfect,” they also specified. “There are often leftovers of one or both of the original materials, which can impede the efficiency of the solar cell.”
The Japanese group applied what it describes as a more precise powder engineering method consisting of adding formamidinium acetate (FAAc) and hydroiodic acid (HI) to PbI2, heating the mixture to 90 degrees Celsius, and then dissolving and filtering out impurities or unreacted materials. “When the perovskite’s absorber layer was formed from the original reaction, it was stable at high temperatures,” it further explained. “However, at room temperature, it turned from brown to yellow, which wasn’t ideal for absorbing light. The synthesized version was brown even at room temperature.”
This perovskite powder was used to build a small-area solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of over 23.5%  and a lifespan of more than 2,000 hours. With this cell, the academics were also able to build a 5 x 5 cm2 small-sized module with an efficiency of around 14%. “Our next step is to make a solar module that is 15 x 15 cm2 and has an efficiency of more than 15%,” said research co-author Guoqing Tong. “One day I hope we can power a building at OIST with our solar modules.”
The technique to fabricate the special perovskite powder is presented in the study “Removal of residual compositions by powder engineering for high efficiency formamidinium-based perovskite solar cells with operation lifetime over 2000 h,” published in Nano Energy.

India added an aggregate 1.2 GW of power generation capacity in the first two months of the current financial year (April-May 2021), all of which came from solar (1 GW) and wind (0.2 GW), according to a new report by Care Ratings.
The two-month capacity addition has been the highest in the last four years when compared to the same months in the previous years. 
Also, the 1.2 GW of solar and wind capacity addition in the first two months of 2021-22 has been double that of the same period during the previous year. 
As of May 31, 2021, the nation reached a total domestic electricity generation capacity of 383 GW, with conventional energy capacity at 288 GW (75% share in total) and renewable energy capacity at 96 GW (25% share), the Care Ratings analysts stated.
Coal-based power, the dominant source of electricity in the country, has an installed capacity of 209 GW (55% share in total). 
Solar power generation capacity currently stands at 41 GW and wind power at 39 GW. Since 2016-17, capacity addition to solar power has been surpassing all other energy sources.
The report stated outstanding dues owed by Discoms to power generators as of April 30, 2021, amounted to INR 68,508 crore ($9.2 billion). The absence of cost-reflective tariffs, high operational expenses, and AT&C losses, along with huge historical outstanding dues, has been pressuring the finances of state distribution utilities over time. 
The outstanding dues were the highest for the Discoms of Tamil Nadu at INR 13,717 crore ($1.8 billion). The other states with notable outstanding dues are Rajasthan (INR 10,326 crore, or $ 1.4 billion) and Maharashtra (INR 9,749 crore, or $1.3 billion). These three states accounted for nearly 50% of the total outstanding dues.
