The figures, produced by Eurostat today, indicated solar power accounted for 14% of Europe's gross electricity consumption in 2020, as part of a 34% renewables share across the continent to which wind power contributed the biggest proportion, with a 36% slice of the cake.
Solar, Eurostat indicated, is the fastest growing renewable energy source in the market.
Hydropower helped Norway and Iceland, members of the European Free Trade Association which gives access to the EU single market, boast more than 100% of their gross electricity consumption came from renewable energy generation.
High shares were also recorded in Austria, which drew upon clean energy for 78% of its consumption; Sweden (with 75% renewables); Denmark (65%); Portugal (58%); and Croatia and Latvia (53% each). At the other end of the scale, clean electricity met only 10% of Malta‘s consumption in 2020, Hungary and Cyprus recorded a figure of 12% each, Luxembourg had just 14% clean power, and Czechia just 15%.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/26/europes-largest-battery-storage-project-leverages-grid-forming-inverter-tech/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED KINGDOM",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 26, 2022",Europe’s largest battery storage project leverages grid-forming inverter tech,"Toronto-based renewables owner and developer Amp Energy has secured approval for the Scottish Green Battery Complex, comprising 800MW/1.6GWh of battery storage capacity in central Scotland.
Amp will develop two 400MW batteries, each offering 800MWh of storage capacity and described the systems as the two biggest grid-connected battery storage facilities in Europe.
The developer received planning consent for the projects from the Scottish Government Energy Consents Unit this month.
The batteries will store and manage the dispatch of renewable energy generated at Scottish windfarms, future-proofing the U.K.'s electricity infrastructure at a fraction of the cost of transmission system upgrades, according to Amp Energy.
“With these ground-breaking projects, Amp is making a significant investment in vitally needed green infrastructure as the U.K. transitions to a fully decarbonized grid,” said Ben Skinner, Amp's VP for global markets. “Our projects not only support the growth of renewable generation in Scotland but also provide an alternative to costly transmission upgrades for consumers.”
Amp's facilities will deploy grid-forming inverter technology alongside two new synchronous condensers, which will also help grid stabilization.
Unlike traditional, grid-following inverters, which sync their output to grid voltage waveforms, advanced, or “grid-forming” inverters can set their own frequencies without the inertia required from large spinning hardware. That makes them capable of providing the grid with virtual inertia, instead of the mechanical inertia provided by synchronous generators, reducing curtailment of intermittent renewable energy generation along the way.
A relatively old technology, costly synchronous condensers are bulky spinning machines usually deployed in parts of the grid that host a high share of solar and wind electricity and suffer from system strength issues. In addition to providing short-circuit power and reactive power compensation, “syncons” can also be used to resolve problems related to inertia – imbalances between supply and demand on the grid.
Today, many system engineers believe syncons will gradually be retired and replaced by batteries operating in “virtual synchronous” mode. Such capabilities make batteries function a lot more like traditional fossil fuel plants on the grid and make them capable of delivering almost the same grid services as syncons, such as extremely fast response to network disturbances – usually in less than 100 milliseconds. Some batteries are already trialing such services, including the 30MW/8MWh Dalrymple ESCRI battery on South Australia’s Yorke Peninsula.
The Scottish Green Battery Complex will be optimized and dispatched by Amp X, the developer's proprietary, AI-powered digital energy platform, which is said to provide solutions to grid constraints. The projects, at Hunterston and Kincardine, will participate in power company National Grid's Scottish Stability Pathfinder 2 tender, which seeks to address voltage and stability issues faced by the U.K. electricity grid, and to provide grid stability services and power management across the central belt of Scotland, including for Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Amp said the Scottish batteries will enable up to 1.75TWh per year of additional renewable energy to be generated in Scotland and transported to other U.K. locations, the equivalent of enabling around 500MW of new offshore wind projects in the coming years.
Scotland is keen on expanding its wind power fleet whereas solar has been largely sidelined in the nation's transition to net zero. In its new energy strategy, released last year, the Scottish government outlined an ambition for 8-10GW of onshore wind farms this decade on top of an existing goal of 11GW of offshore facilities. Of solar, the government said only that the technology could play “an important role in continuing to decarbonize our heat and electricity supply.” While national PV trade body Solar Energy Scotland welcomed the mention of photovoltaics in the document, the policy paper fell short of the group's call for 4-6GW of solar generation capacity to be installed by 2030.
In an historic windfarm auction held this month, the Scottish Crown Estate – comprising land and holdings which belong to Queen Elizabeth II but whose revenues finance the Scottish Parliament – awarded seabed permits to 17 companies to build nearly 25GW of offshore wind project capacity under the ScotWind leasing program. Those projects, to be developed over the next 10 years, will more than double the extent of the U.K.’s current 10GW of offshore wind facilities, and be equal to Europe’s current combined capacity.

The decision, announced yesterday, came about after Czech renewables company Vysočina Wind brought an action for damages after it had contributed to such waste disposal costs in relation to a solar project it constructed after Aug. 13, 2005.
Under a Czech law in place at the time Vysočina installed its solar park, the developer – rather than the manufacturer of the solar panels used – was liable for associated waste management costs. As a result, Vysočina made contributions to such costs in 2015 and 2016 but it then brought the action for damages on the basis the Czech authorities had wrongly transposed into domestic law EU directive 2012/19 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), which placed the financial burden on the panel manufacturers.
Vysočina's case was upheld in the first instance and on appeal and the Czech government appealed on a point of law to the country's supreme court, the Nejvyšší soud. That body referred the matter to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling, which can now be applied in the member state's legal system as the Czech court sees fit.
The ECJ noted that before the EU's WEEE directive entered into force, on Aug. 13, 2012, European member states had the freedom to place the obligation of paying for electrical waste management on either the manufacturer or user of solar panels. Because of that, the ECJ ruled, the introduction of the WEEE directive changed a previously established situation and, therefore, could not be applied retroactively.
In its ruling, the European court stated: “The court declares article 13(1) of the WEEE directive invalid in so far as it imposes on producers the obligation to finance the costs relating to the management of waste from photovoltaic panels placed on the market between 13 August 2005 and 13 August 2012.”
The court also ruled Czech legislators, who had introduced domestic rules for electronic waste management liability a month before the entering into force of the EU's WEEE legislation, had not breached EU law.

With the European Commission on New Year's Day having raised the hackles of the renewables lobby by proposing fossil fuel gas and divisive energy source nuclear be defined by the EU as “sustainable,” a speech delivered to high-level African representatives indicated the EU executive sees gas as part of the shift to renewable energy.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
Timmermans, in a speech published on the European Commission website on Thursday, said: “You asked about the role of gas as a transitional fuel. And I want to be very clear: The EU considers gas as a bridge to climate neutrality but only if it makes sense. When is that the case? If there is no other option. If it replaces coal, and if the investments made are hydrogen-ready, because clean gases are the real answer for our future energy needs. Sure, in some places in Africa gas will be part of the energy mix and that is also part of the transition.”
The executive VP for the European Green Deal did immediately go on to stress the potentially more attractive business case offered by solar and wind plants, whose costs have fallen remarkably in the last decade, even if solar panel prices started to move back up again last year, thanks to shortages of raw material polysilicon and much-publicized supply chain and shipping bottlenecks.
The draft of the speech was published the day before Sandrine Dixson-Declève, a member of commission advisory body the Platform on Sustainable Finance, described the notion of defining gas – and nuclear – as sustainable energy sources as “completely inappropriate.”
Maia Godemer, research associate at analyst BloombergNEF will look back on the 2021 sustainable debt market in the February edition of pv magazine. Concerning the EU sustainability taxonomy, she writes: “In its current state, the proposed greenhouse gas thresholds for natural gas could derail EU climate targets and weaken the bloc’s green investment offering, according to BloombergNEF. The inclusion of nuclear raises eyebrows due to safety and waste management issues, which could prevent the technology [satisfying] the “do no significant harm” criteria outlined in the taxonomy.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/26/italys-steeplechase-towards-battery-deployment/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,ITALY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"JANUARY 26, 2022",Italy’s steeplechase towards battery deployment,"Italy simplified permitting for small storage systems last year but the country still needs to readjust its medium-term plans to make them coherent with its ambitious climate and energy targets.
“Storage needs to be considered, also in line with the European approach, as a market player, similar to a generating asset,” said Canazza. “To reach the renewables targets defined by the [EU] Green Deal, storage is a necessary component of the electricity system. The investments are very interesting but their economic return is still very risky.”
Several factors make such investment tricky, explained the partner at MBS Consulting -Cerved Group. REF-E recently became the practice “Energy and Utilities” of MBS Consulting -Cerved Group.
Permitting procedures are heterogeneous. They depend on the size and configuration of specific power plants. “The permitting process has been quite simplified but persisting barriers are evident for [the] relevant size [of] storage which could participate in the ancillary services market,” said Canazza.
The Milan-based engineer said, for large scale power plants permitting procedures are still complex. “The simplification is applied very effectively for small scale storage projects, or for configurations that are coupled with self-consumption, or in other aggregated configurations,” she explained. “There is not a consistent approach for … market access and the simplification of [the] permitting process.”
In other words, each storage project is different but larger ones are still suffering.
According to Canazza, storage business models can be sustained if storage power plants can, in this first phase of development, participate in the ancillary services market, which is considered to be very attractive, especially in geographic areas with a high concentration of intermittent renewables generation.
“In our simulation of the business model for configurations of storage facilities, we see that around 50-55% of the investment cost could be covered by the expected revenues in the ancillary services market,” said Canazza, adding: “Only 10% could be expected in … time-shifting on the day-ahead [electricity] market. So, in aggregation, revenues from the spot market could arrive to cover around 60-65% of the [project] capex [capital expenditure]. Around 35-40% is the range of cost that needs to be complemented with some dedicated capacity remuneration mechanism.”
Canazza, an advisor to Milan-based management consultancy MBS Consulting, said large parts of storage revenue streams would be exposed to the electricity dispatching market. “The dispatching market is not predictable, by definition,” said the energy consultant. “It is a very local market, it is a real-time market, and significant regulatory reforms could change its equilibria in the future.”
A year ago, fast frequency reserve auctions pushed batteries through a capacity remuneration mechanism. The batteries deployed are power-intensive rather than energy-intensive. However, Canazza said storage installations will increasingly have a space in other market segments too.
“The capacity market, dedicated to a service of availability during the hours of expected shortness of the system, is the second window for storage applications in the market, after the fast reserve auctions,” she said. “The mechanism applies a de-rating factor to the nominal capacity to determine the amount of capacity eligible in the mechanism – the lower the storage capacity of the asset, the higher the de-rating factor. So the mechanism offers the greatest participation opportunities to energy-intensive storage assets.”
In the decree implementing the European directive on energy markets 2019/944, Italian electricity transmission system operator (TSO) Terna has been asked to define “system needs” in terms of flexibility requirements or pre-selected, high-quality dispatching services which could be coupled with storage. Regulatory body ARERA (the Autorità di Regolazione per Energia Reti e Ambiente) will then define a capacity mechanism for the remuneration of new power plants that could cope with the needs defined by Terna.
“We expect a progressive fine-tuning of new mechanisms dedicated to storage, with more consistent technical requirements for storage power plants,” said Canazza. “Dedicated mechanisms could be more effective to ensure the above mentioned 40% missing remuneration, and could address the supply of specific services that only storage assets can provide to the system. The counter-effect is that these mechanisms are not yet defined and the position of ARERA is that there will be a progressive upgrade of this mechanism following the emerging needs and issues. From an investor point of view, the uncertainty about future remuneration mechanisms could limit strategic investment decisions.”
She added, despite strong interest in such investment opportunities, the market design and delays to legislation about future support mechanisms could limit the scope for investment. Investor appetites could be seriously dampened.
“The draft of the decree foresees [in] article 19 that, if private investments are not sufficient to match identified system security needs, the TSO could invest in storage assets,” added Canazza. “The correct way of implementation needs, however, to be specified. Operators have already suggested that the possibility for the TSO to directly develop storage systems could limit competition, giving Terna a strategic advantage.
Currently, new storage projects are strictly related to the geographical development of new renewables plants. “This is the first driver for the localization of … new storage projects,” said Canazza. As already stated, fast frequency response service auctions are a second driver and, according to the energy expert: “Some are currently in an advanced phase of … implementation.”
In the future, though, storage project location could depend on other factors. According to Canazza, storage will be a solution in congested cluster nodes with a limited capacity to host renewables generation, and also in areas affected by critical grid and security issues.
“Considering the current topology and the critical areas in the electricity grid, storage will be very important in the [Italian] islands, in the south of Italy, or where there are portions of the grid [which are] very congested and [where] network reinforcement [is] difficult to implement,” said Canazza. “For … new projects, the business model is very connected to … local opportunities, not only to the zonal market: Storage will take part in the ancillary services market, which is, naturally, local.”
She predicted that would not mean electricity interconnections such as the Tyrrhenian Link connecting southern regions to the main islands of Italy, would limit the scope of storage options. “Storage can answer to local flexibility needs; the Tyrrhenian Link can solve structural congestion among market zones, expanding the competitiveness of the market,” she explained. “They have different objectives, which are complementary in the energy transition.”
Looking ahead, storage projects which are now operational could be upgraded.
“There is the possibility that current power-intensive storage [projects] will be progressively upgraded … to energy-intensive storage … to capture increasing market opportunities,” added Canazza. “This would be a progressive transformation, following system flexibility needs.” Big utilities are already including storage in their strategic plans.
“But new players will enter … the market, including investors that come from abroad,” she told pv magazine. “We are working for different developers that come from markets where they [have] accumulated experience. And they would like to export their expertise [to] Italy, given the attractiveness of the Italian [legislative] framework.”
Batteries and hydrogen have a theoretically similar function: the storage of energy. Canazza said the two are complementary, rather than direct competitors.
“Electrolyzers need to reach high utilization factors in order to reduce the LCOH [levelized cost of hydrogen], the cost per unit of hydrogen production,” said Canazza. “Electrolyzers can work well when there is … systematic renewables over-generation, or in general whenever there is a great excess of renewables production to be absorbed. It refers to the condition that could occur in the long-term, when renewables will represent the main component of the energy mix.”
Storage assets, instead, intrinsically act as flexible short term resources, balancing the system against the variability of intermittent energy sources. They are, added the consultant, “very fast and efficient in responding to security system needs for maximizing demand coverage by renewables.”
The raw materials crisis may have an impact on storage, due to an increase in the cost of renewables and battery assets.
“The timing is very important,” said Canazza. “If sourcing the technology will require more time than the optimum timing for capturing emerging market opportunities, this will be an issue for investors that could produce delays, losses and competitive disadvantages.”
The analyst agreed with other energy commentators who have predicted big companies could enjoy a favorable position, especially if they have made investments in components in advance. Big business could also benefit from the strategies of technology developers. “Technology providers could apply greater discounts to bigger orders, that could also [offer] a certain priority in … supply,” added Canazza.
Another risk, in the longer term, stems from over-investment and intense competition.
“Excessive storage development can produce strong cannibalization effects,” said Canazza, “price spreads will be reduced by the operation of the assets and regulation volumes on the ancillary services market could be optimized thanks to the major availability of flexible resources. During the useful life [of storage projects], there is a significant risk [of capturing] lower revenues than those expected at the time of the investment decision, depending on the level of competition.”
In the first phase of storage plant deployment, the risk of cannibalization is expected to come from traditional power plants participating in the ancillary services market. “CCGTs [combined cycle gas turbines] are very competitive in the ancillary services market and additional high efficiency and flexible thermal capacity will enter the market through the capacity market mechanism in the next few years,” said Canazza. “If the current wave of storage projects [are] realized, in the short term there could be an excess of flexibility resources compared to … system needs. But this effect could be different at a local level.”
In a second phase of the utility scale storage market, over a more long-term horizon when renewables hit policy targets, Canazza said, “a boom in energy-intensive storage could have the counter-effect of mitigating day-ahead market price-spreads and limiting time-shifting opportunities.”
That risk, however, could be mitigated if future storage-dedicated mechanisms effectively consider the available market room for storage capacity at a geographical level, the REF-E analyst added.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/26/the-fine-art-of-gettering/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 26, 2022",The fine art of gettering,"Scientists at The Australian National University (ANU) have conducted a review of all gettering technologies used in solar wafer manufacturing and offered a comprehensive analysis of the possible gettering sinks and routes for different solar cell architectures.
This technique involves three steps and is utilized during crystal growth to remove containments and other forms of defects in wafers. Through this process, the impurities are initially released into a solid solution and then undergo diffusion through the silicon. Finally, they are trapped in an area away from the active circuit regions of the wafer.
“Gettering is already embedded in most of the current solar cells, through phosphorus diffusion in PERC or PERx devices, as well as in Al-BSF cells,” the research's corresponding author, Anyao Liu, told pv magazine. “Gettering is also embedded in TOPCon solar cells, although its effectiveness varies a lot, and in silicon heterojunction cells it can be used as a pre-treatment to improve the quality of silicon substrates.
According to her, gettering can be seen as an additional benefit of certain process steps in current industrial cell processing. “However, as cell efficiency increases and becomes increasingly sensitive to traces of metallic impurities, gettering will become an important consideration in cell processing and process parameters of diffusion and polysilicon/oxide fabrication,” she also explained.
In the paper “Gettering in silicon photovoltaics: A review,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar cells, Liu and her colleagues presented all the nomenclatures used in gettering and summarized recent updates to the solubility and diffusivity data of the 3d transition metals used in the process, the so-called getters.
“Many of the gettering techniques in microelectronics are not applicable or effective in silicon PV,” they warned, noting that external gettering is generally more effective in silicon cells, as the silicon wafer bulk represents an important part of the active device region. “The external gettering routes that are most relevant for the state-of-the-art solar cells in mass production are phosphorus diffusion, to a lesser degree boron diffusion, and the emerging P or B-doped poly-Si/SiOx structures,” they also stated.
Phosphorus diffusion is, to date, the most utilized and investigated gettering technique in the solar industry however, its underlying
mechanisms are still controversial and unresolved, according to the research group. Boron diffusion is described as very effective only under unconventional process conditions and is recommended for doped-poly-Si/SiOx structures, which provides a route to simultaneously achieve p+ doping and a strong gettering effect.
“The heavily doped c-Si surfaces and/or heavily doped poly-Si/SiOx structures are incorporated in almost all of the high-temperature cell
architectures,” the scientists further explained. “As the two are effective gettering sinks and their under–pinning gettering mechanisms are likely the same, a better understanding and identification of the key mechanisms will help to further exploit the benefits of gettering in silicon PV.”
The paper also analyzed other capture approaches such as selective doping via ion implantation, state-of-the-art polycrystalline-
silicon/oxide passivating contact structures, dielectric films, aluminum alloying, the use of surface-damaged regions including black silicon, and internal gettering in cast-grown silicon using existing crystallographic defects.

Their analysis included passive and active cooling methods, cooling with PCMs, and cooling with PCM and other additives, such as nanoparticles or porous metal.
“Many studies made a general review of the methods of cooling PV solar cells, especially the first three methods,” the scientists said. “Therefore, the current research is characterized by dealing with different cooling techniques, focusing on the fourth method, and summarizing all the researches that dealt with cooling PV solar cells with PCM and porous metal.”
For the active cooling category, the researchers analyzed forced air cooling and forced water cooling, as well as techniques that use the water circulating in photovoltaic-thermal panels to cool down the temperature of the PV module. The scientists said these methods are the most expensive but most effective in reducing PV module temperatures. They said active cooling ensures that uniform temperature distribution is achieved by improved heat exchanger designs.
“The active cooling technique is considered an effective way to improve the photovoltaic performance, but it depends on an external power source, so the external power is deducted from the power produced from the PV cells, reducing the net output power produced from the PV cells,” they said.
They described the passive technologies as less expensive than their active counterparts. They said they could only lower module temperatures by a “small percentage.” These methods include natural air cooling, natural water cooling, and heat pipes.
“Immersion cooling, heat pipes, natural air cooling with fins, heat sinks, and improved heat exchanger designs were found to yield uniform temperature in most of the PV installations. Heat pipe cooling with its high heat flux dissipation capability was shown to be effective for PV cooling,” the research group said.
The scientists said that PCMs are effective at absorbing excess solar panel heat that is not converted into electrical energy.
“Latent heat of PCM helps in lowering panel temperature, bringing it closer to 25 C and maintaining it almost constant during peak sunny hours,” they said, adding that the efficiency of the system is higher in summer than in winter.
The Egyptian group said that, despite several promising features, advanced experiments with PCMs with additives are still needed to evaluate the feasibility of organic and combined PCMs in PV cooling. Porous metal was found to be less expensive than nanoparticles.
They explained their findings in “Review of cooling techniques used to enhance the efficiency of photovoltaic power systems,” which was recently published in Environmental Science and Pollution Research.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/26/arctech-2022-will-be-a-year-of-solar-opportunities-and-challenges/,"INVERTERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"JANUARY 26, 2022",Arctech: 2022 will be a year of solar opportunities and challenges,"Allen Cao, General Manager of International Business, Arctech: The buzzword for the solar PV industry last year was definitely “price rises”. 2021 marked the beginning of China’s 2060 carbon-neutral policy target and a series of favorable policies made the market's sentiment on renewable energy unprecedentedly high. The scaled-up expectation and the mismatch of upstream and downstream production capacity have caused the price of silicon materials to rise. Due to the accumulation of power restrictions and other factors, the price of silicon materials reached a daunting 10-year high in the fourth quarter, and soaring ocean freight costs led to a substantial increase in the cost of installations. These factors meant that module manufacturers suffered inevitable and abundant losses after signing contracts. There were also some breaches of sales contracts on the back of this, which affected the credibility of the solar industry in general.
It is difficult to pass on the increased costs from the supply chain to end-users, which have resulted in the decline of profit margins for upstream component manufacturers. In addition, solar trackers are usually used in large-scale utility PV projects. For projects that have finalized their financial model, the substantial cost increases in the supply chain led to a shortage of project funds, thus project owners had to communicate with electricity power buyers to postpone their project's grid connection time.
For those in the development process, project owners have been on the fence about whether to carry on with the projects. In some price-sensitive markets, a few projects have been forced to change to solutions with lower initial costs like using multicrystalline panels and racks. These factors will cause temporary difficulties for tracker providers in specific markets.
Owners of power plants have begun to pay more attention to LCOE and to pursue more electricity output when the initial investment cannot be effectively reduced. Solar trackers can help them by continuously optimizing power generation, and therefore they are increasingly popular with power stations.
Arctech is committed to becoming the world's top supplier of solar tracking solutions. Thus, strategizing the global market has always been our top priority. According to Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables’ 2021 report, Arctech ranked first in Asia-Pacific in terms of market share for four straight years. In 2021, we realized the 2.1GW Abu Dhabi project together with other large-scale projects worldwide. The company has successfully maintained its leading position in regions including India, the Middle East, and Latin America. The company also witnessed a breakthrough in the US market last year and will continue to focus on this market in 2022.
In recent years, Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) has become a mainstream solution for distributed photovoltaic power stations. Arctech began exploring BIPV solutions in 2016, and it has managed to expand the application scenarios through the years. For instance, our “Smart Rooftop BIPV Solution” won recognition in the ceramic industry in China. From the 40.9MW Marco Polo Ceramics  BIPV project in Fengcheng to the 11.5MW BIPV project in Foshan, and the 120MW BIPV project in Gaoan, Jiangxi, which will soon become the world’s largest BIPV project, the highly innovative and cost-effective BIPV solutions offered by Arctech have helped to create many landmarks. In 2022, Arctech will continue to empower more companies from various industries to achieve zero-carbon transformation with BIPV solutions.
The company currently has a production capacity of 6.4GW, and there is an additional 2.8GW of production capacity at our Fanchang manufacturing base, which is in trial operation. We also have a manufacturing base with a capacity of 3GW in India which is set to enter operation in the first half of 2022. In addition to our own production capacity, we use OEM operators in overseas markets to indirectly expand our capacity and meet the growing logistics cost challenges.
Arctech launched its Skyline II tracking system in October 2021, meaning the company has fully entered the era of synchronizing multi-point driving systems. From the multi-row trackers to SkyLine I (one in portrait trackers) and SkySmart I (two in portrait trackers), to SkyLine II (1P with multi-point driving mechanism) and SkySmart II (2P with multi-point driving mechanism), Arctech has been enhancing its leadership in research and development.

SkyLine II is the first 1P solar tracker equipped with multi-point drive mechanisms in the industry. It can be adapted to mount the optimum number of strings per tracker for each PV module, allowing larger bending and torsional capabilities with minimum steel utilization, fewer columns, and they can withstand higher wind stow thresholds. SkyLine II is a very stiff tracker that mounts a synchronous multi-point drive mechanism. It has increased the wind stow threshold to 22m/s, the highest in the industry so far, which allows it to track the sun for many more hours compared to the industry standard. The rigidity provided by the multi-point drive mechanism also allows it to safely stow to 0-degree. A case study in Texas, US, shows how the SkyLine II can generate more power. Compared with other projects that are installed with traditional trackers, SkyLine II allows for an annual energy collection that is 1.6% higher. For a typical plant Capex and PPA pricing in the area was equivalent to an IRR increase of about 0.2% or $3 million more in revenue throughout the life of the project.
2022 will be a year of opportunities and challenges. On one hand, we see that as the price of silicon materials and wafers have begun a downward trend, and the projects postponed in 2021 are very likely to be back on the right track in 2022, it is highly possible that we will witness a sharp rise in year-on-year installation capacity, which is a promising sign. On the other hand, we will face challenges from the market on demanding a stronger delivery capability. We will also stay alert to the challenges and uncertainties on installed costs brought by the coronavirus pandemic, namely high international logistics costs, inflation risks, exchange rate fluctuations, etc. in the coming year.

“There are about 823 acres of fish ponds in Gangmei Town, where the solar park is located,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “The project is covering a 380-acre fish pond.”
The plant is owned and operated by China's largest energy company, the State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC). Sungrow Renewables Development Co Ltd constructed the facility, acting as an EPC contractor.
The solar park is currently selling power to State Grid Corporation of China, which is China’s largest state-owned grid operator and power utility, at a price of RMB0.453/kWh ($0.0762). “The project's levelized cost of energy is RMB0.14/kWh ($0.022) and total investment in the project was about RMB600 million ($94.9 million),” Jetion's spokesperson added.

The solar manufacturer provided its 21.2%-efficient JT SSh(B) 450W/455W high-efficiency dual-glass panels for the project.
“The double-sided design can achieve higher power generation gain and the dual-glass design can bring better weather resistance and low attenuation,” Jetion said in a statement. “Compared with traditional modules, Jetion Solar dual-glass modules have extremely low water permeability, and do not need to consider the problem of water vapor entering the modules to induce hydrolysis of [the] EVA film, effectively adapting to the water surface or high humidity environment and at the same time reducing the post-project operation and maintenance costs, creating higher benefits for customers.”
The company added it will keep supplying its products for other unspecified projects in the area, for a total capacity of around 670MW.

India has the world’s most arable land, and farmers currently irrigate their fields with more than 30 million agro pump-sets. Out of these, 22 million pump-sets are connected to the grid, around 10 million pumps are diesel pumps, while 3,50,000 pumps are solar pumps, mostly deployed in the last five years. 
Grid-powered pump-sets consume more than 18% of the total annual electricity consumption of India and diesel pump sets consume over 5.5% of the overall diesel import bill. In the 2017-18 period, the annual electricity subsidy for agriculture alone amounted to over INR 1.1 trillion ($14.7 billion) and the annual diesel import bill towards agro-pump sets was estimated at around INR 0.4 trillion. 
As a country, India is one of the biggest agriculture-driven economies, making our farmers front-runners in the race. The agriculture sector alone accounts for nearly 18.33% of India’s electricity consumption. The deployment of solar-powered pumps helps in reducing electricity consumption and shifting that load to green energy.  
With more than 75% of the population directly engaged with agriculture, it is safe to say that India is primarily an agrarian society. The government is taking all possible steps to support Anna Daata (farmers) of our country. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) unveiled the PM-KUSUM (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthan Mahaabhiyan) Scheme, which aimed to add solar and other renewable capacities of 25,750 MW.
In most cases, the grid electricity supply is erratic during the night. Battery-coupled solar-powered water pumps running on a renewable source of energy ensure water supply anytime water is required. Also, farmers need not visit the farm at midnight to switch on diesel power to the pump in case of a grid outage. Additionally, solar power creates employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas, and improves the standard of living of the farmers. 
At COP26, India raised the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of non-fossil energy to 500 GW by 2030 from the earlier 450 GW, which includes 300 GW of solar. It is estimated India can meet a substantial amount of its renewable target by converting agro pump-sets to solar. In line with this, the PM-KUSUM scheme aims at replacing all diesel pumps with standalone off-grid pumps and solarizing all grid-connected pump sets. 
Under the PM KUSUM scheme, the farmer benefits from the latest technology pumps powered by solar energy. Solar pump installation is aided by attractive subsidies from the government and is a win-win solution for all stakeholders.
MNRE has envisioned the success of this program on India-made components including solar cells and modules, solar pumps and inverters, etc. The scheme design allows farmers and beneficiaries to choose among the empaneled service providers. In addition, the participation of solar module and pump system manufacturers in the PM –KUSUM program highlights the reliance on contribution from domestic manufacturers. 
With solar water pumps, farmers have access to high-quality power available for irrigation. These systems are portable and can be assembled at any preferred location. With the growing utilization of these systems, the costs have decreased substantially, making them an efficient, convenient, and cost-effective solution for grid-isolated rural areas. 
Solar water pumps are a low-cost solution that enables farmers to spend more time increasing their income by growing crops, instead of ferrying water from miles away. Adhering to the government’s vision, businesses are focused on building solar water pump solutions. Solar-powered water pump solutions help transform farmers’ lives by providing sustainable power and timely water availability, thereby increasing their yield and income. The system boosts the income of the farmers, reduces the reliance on erratic power, and increases water supply without incurring any fuel cost.

SunWiz, a solar market research company, has published its “2021 Australian Solar Year in Review” report. It reveals the year’s most popular brands of solar panels and inverters.
The full report is behind a paywall, but pv magazine Australia has been given permission to publish the top 14 panel brands in the rooftop segment in alphabetical order:
For inverters, the top 10 brands with the largest market shares in the rooftop segment are as follows (again, in alphabetical order):
The final quarter of 2021 saw a shakeup of the panel brand leader board. Jinko lost significant market share in the fourth quarter, while Longi’s most radical descent happened across the second quarter.
On the other end of the scale, Canadian Solar markedly increased its market share from the second quarter and Hanwha Q Cells rocketed up in the fourth quarter. JA Solar also enjoyed a surge in popularity from the second quarter.
In terms of brand origin, leading Chinese brands continued to account for the greatest portion of the Australian market by a long shot. Their popularity peaked in August, before dropping steadily through to November, with a slight increase in December.
Premium brands, on the other hand, followed a reverse trend, with their popularity at a low point in August before steadily growing through to November. The popularity of premium panel brands dropped slightly in December. Brands that fell into neither of these baskets remained steady from July to November, but grew their market share in December.
Last year saw record volumes of solar installed, with growth primarily driven by rooftop solar which compensated for the  slowdown in the utility-scale segment. In total, 5.2 GW of solar was installed in 2021, putting Australia’s cumulative tally at 26.9 GW. By November, Australia reached a landmark with more than 3 million solar systems installed on rooftops, solidifying the country’s global lead in terms of solar per capita.
While the popularity of rooftop solar has created economies of scale pushing down the average price for residential solar systems, chaos in the solar supply chain and diminished product output from China drove prices up in the second half of the year. Prices are likely to remain high in the first half of 2022.
