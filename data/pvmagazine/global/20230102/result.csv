The Japanese utility said it was forced to apply the measures in response to high solar radiation levels and low energy demand during the holiday period.
The control period will span from 8 am (GMT+9) to 4 pm and will be applied for at least three days, depending on the weather and demand conditions, the company said. It noted that the measure was applied from Jan. 1, when electricity demand reached approximately 669 MW against 738 MW of supply.
Okinawa is Japan's southernmost prefecture of Japan. According to the the Okinawa Times, the prefecture currently hosts around 1,400 solar installations.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) issued its first “Power Crunch Alert” for the Tokyo Region in March, after an earthquake hit the region. In June, Mitsubishi and Japanese utility Kyushu Electric Power Co. said they would team up to use grid-scale battery storage to reduce the impact of solar curtailment on the island of Kyushu, in southern Japan.
According to Japan's Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies (ISEP), the island of Kyushu had around 10.5 GW of PV and 600 MW of wind capacity installed under the country's feed-in scheme by the end of 2021. The curtailment rate in the region for the entire year was estimated at around 4.4%, up from 3.8% in the preceding year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/02/a-closer-look-at-potential-induced-degradation-in-solar-cells/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JANUARY 2, 2023",A closer look at potential-induced degradation in solar cells,"PID covers a range of different effects that have been observed to reduce PV module performance in the field. The way these effects progress can differ depending on module materials, installation conditions, and other factors, generally related to currents leaking from PV cells into the module frame or other elements.
Scientists at York University in the United Kingdom examined how PID affected a 1.2 MW PV installation in Barcelona, Spain, in a multi-year study beginning in 2019. The study used thermal drone imaging to spot PID affecting several module strings within the project – by looking for modules with elevated surface temperature. The study found four strings in the project that were affected by PID after one year in operation, and continued to observe these over time.
The results of the study can be found in “Field study on the severity of photovoltaic potential induced degradation,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports. The group found that these strings were initially affected due to grounding faults in the project’s inverters. Comparing results from the affected strings to a “healthy” one in the same project, the key findings include that even where PID appears to have had little effect on overall system performance, once it appears it can cause a sudden drop in performance at almost any time.
And it can also begin to develop in a string at almost any time, meaning more frequent testing or drone imaging should be carried out to prevent it. The study also found that an “anti-PID” box, fitted to the identified strings after one year in operation, could prevent further PID performance loss and even bring about some degree of recovery, though some modules had permanently reduced performance – outlining the need for early detection of PID mechanisms.
Polarization PID
In further recently published research, scientists led by the University of Tsukuba in Japan conducted a close analysis of one PID mechanism known as “polarization PID,” which is known as the fastest progressing mode of PID, has been demonstrated in various cell architectures, and has shown resistance to common mitigation methods, such as switching to a POE encapsulant.
In their paper, “Mechanistic Understanding of Polarization-Type Potential-Induced Degradation in Crystalline-Silicon Photovoltaic Cell Modules,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy & Sustainability Research, the group develops a model for polarization PID mechanisms and outlines two factors that distinguish it from others.
“The two following features were particularly important: the bias direction causing degradation is not always negative. It depends on the doping of the surface,” the scientists explained. “Also, polarization-type PID is considerably faster than PID of other types. It saturates within a very short time. A model that is consistent with the characteristic features must be built.”
The group applied its “K-Center” model to various examples, illustrating how it can accurately explain various PID effects, and with further development they expect it to be a valuable tool in understanding and mitigating performance losses caused by polarization PID.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/02/techniques-to-build-thermally-co-evaporated-mini-perovskite-solar-panels/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SINGAPORE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 2, 2023",Techniques to build thermally co-evaporated mini perovskite solar panels,"Scientists from Singapore's Energy Research Institute at Nanyang Technological University have investigated how thermal evaporation (TE) could be used to fabricate mini perovskite solar modules. TE are mature techniques that are commonly used in the microelectronic and optoelectronic industries to produce organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), metal contacts, and coatings for various materials.
“We analyzed the use of several evaporation-based techniques to fabricate halide perovskite thin films,” researcher Annalisa Bruno told pv magazine. “These range from the relatively simple single-source deposition and multi-source co-evaporation to the more complex multistep evaporation and hybrids of thermal evaporation with gas reaction and solution processing.”
She said this combined approach exploits the advantages of both methods. But she noted that it also has some limitations, such as increased complexity and the use of solvents.
” We believe that thermal evaporation is the ideal perovskite deposition method to make that jump rapidly, since it is easily scalable, free from hazardous solvents, and already well-integrated into current opto- and microelectronics production lines,” said Bruno.
The researchers said one of the main issues with co-evaporation is the need for extensive optimization of the deposition parameters for perovskites with complex stoichiometries, especially when more than two or three precursors are evaporated at the same time. They also noted how long deposition time could present a barrier for commercial production, as most studies of these techniques tend to neglect this issue.
Their review presented a series of techniques to fabricate both perovskite solar cells and mini modules. These methods include one-step thermal evaporation, multi-step thermal evaporation, and multi-step hybrid deposition.
“It would be desirable to produce not only evaporated perovskite films but also fully evaporated modules using the same fabrication lines,” the group said.
The advantages reportedly include a high degree of process control, precisely controllable film thickness, easy sequential addition of multiple layers, and low-substrate temperature processability. The researchers claim that the methods could also enable better purification of the precursors during film formation, excellent spatial uniformity within device batches, good reproducibility across multiple fabrication rounds, and high production yield.
“The entire process can be automated and controlled, making it intrinsically attractive for large-scale and high-throughput manufacturing,” they said. 
They described the production techniques in “Thermal evaporation and hybrid deposition of perovskite solar cells and mini-modules,” which was recently published in Joule.
“We believe the future of research in this field should look in new optimal device interlayers to improve the quality of the active material and the transparency,  passivating defects by vacuum-based techniques, and boosting operational stability in order to maximize and realize the full potential of thermally evaporated perovskite solar devices,” said Bruno.

After notifying Tesla, which will supply its Megapacks for the project, and balance of plant contractor UGL, early construction work on the Western Downs Battery is now underway. The battery will be situated next to the nearly completed 460 MWp Western Downs solar farm. Neoen estimates an operational date in the Australian summer of 2024-25.
The project received the support of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency's (ARENA) Large Scale Battery Storage Funding Round, which will see the battery equipped with grid-forming inverter technology to help it perform essential system stability services previously provided by synchronous generators like coal and gas.
ARENA CEO Darren Miller described battery storage as an “essential technology in the transition to renewable energy, allowing us to smooth out variable generation and store electricity for when it's needed.”
“Next generation grid scale batteries such as Western Downs Battery will underpin this transition, with inverter technology that can maintain grid stability without fossil fuels,” added Miller.
The battery's primary function will primarily see it firming renewables, notably solar from Neoen's Western Downs Green Power Hub, in addition to frequency services and transmission network support.
“We are thrilled to be pressing ‘go' on the Western Downs Battery, building upon our Western Downs solar farm which is nearing completion” said Neoen Australia's Managing Director Louis de Sambucy.
Neoen's chairman and CEO, Xavier Barbaro, added that the battery will be the most powerful in Queensland, “a state where the pace of the energy transition is accelerating.”
The news comes only weeks after Neoen's plans to develop a stand-alone 1 GW/4 GWh battery near the transitioning coal town of Collie in Western Australia were approved by the state and local authorities.
The Collie gigawatt-scale project, which is expected to be operation “by or before 2025,” will include five individual 200 MW/800 MWh battery compounds with a total combined output of 1,000 MW/4,000 MWh. The project will be constructed in 200 MW/800 MWh stages “to meet the progressive increase in demand for energy storage.”
Neoen also built the now 150 MW/194 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, the world’s first big battery, and the 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery which came online in December 2021, the 100 MW/200 MWh Capital battery outside Canberra, a 300 MW/800 MWh battery near Blyth in South Australia, and a 500 MW/1000 MWh battery to be built near Wallerawang west of Sydney. It has also submitted a development application for a of 200 MW/400 MWh battery facility to be built near Chittering in Western Australia.
Neoen's continuing big battery expansion across Australia should come as no surprise considering the developer credited its Victorian Big Battery for almost tripling its storage revenue in the first nine months of 2022. To September 2022, the company’s revenues totalled $547 million (USD 347.4 million), with growth in solar and wind revenues paling beside the massive surge from battery storage.
According to Neoen it now holds a global storage portfolio of 842 MW/1,341 MWh.

The procurement exercise involved three solar projects totaling 500 MW in the Namangan, Bukhara, and Khorezm regions.
Abu Dhabi-based developer Masdar secured the project in the Bukhara region with a bid of $0.03044/kWh. The 250 MW plant will be connected to a 62 MW storage facility.
A consortium led by PowerChina secured the 150 MW project in Uzbekistan’s Namangan region. The group offered a final price of $0.04828/kWh.
French developer Voltalia won the project in the Khorezm region with a bid of $0.02888/kWh.
The Uzbek authorities initially selected 11 bidders for the final phase of the tender. The list also included Chinese solar developer Jinko Power, Saudi Arabian utility ACWA Power, Turkey's Alarko Holding AS, and Egypt's Elsewedy Electric. Other bidders include Qatar-based Nebras Power, a consortium led by India's ReNew Power, Spanish developer Solarpack, French developer Voltalia, and Chinese inverter maker TBEA.
The procurement exercise is the first of two solar tenders for 900 MW that Uzbekistan’s Ministry of Energy announced in August 2021. The country aims to deploy 8 GW of solar by 2030. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the country had only installed 104 MW of solar by the end of 2021.

“It takes advantage of the heat absorption properties of the earth, offers unbeatable aerodynamics, and is the lowest cost installation method in the world,” the company said in a statement.
Erthos claims that the new method enables the construction of solar plants in half the time and one-third of the land compared to conventional ground-mounted facilities. The new method also uses 70% fewer cables and trenches, and reportedly reduces installation costs by at least 20%.
Daniel Flaningan, head of marketing and product at Erthos, said the project design only requires light civil engineering. The method is also usable in different topographies, with little to no grading. In addition, projects built under this system can withstand “category 4” hurricanes, according to the company.
The company recently signed an agreement with US developer Industrial Sun LLC for a new solar project of more than 100 MW in Texas.
“As it is an area with minimal developable land, the developer could not install such a large project with conventional solar technologies, which usually require between five and six acres of land per megawatt,” said Erthos. “In contrast, Earth Mount Solar PV typically requires less than 2.5 acres per MW, achieving more than double the energy density of typical systems.”
The company is offering its Earth Mount Solar system with its software platform and long-term energy services, including full operations and maintenance. It also provides robotic cleaning services. In addition to the United States, the company has experience in Latin America, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, India, and Asia.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/02/residential-thermo-acoustic-heat-pump-produces-water-up-to-80-c/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HEAT PUMPS,HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FRANCE,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 2, 2023",French startup unveils new residential thermo-acoustic heat pump,"French startup Equium has developed a heat pump core that works on acoustic waves and produces hot and cold air. Equium manufactures the core and works with another company that integrates it into heat pump systems. The units are scalable from 1 kW to 3 kW and are designed for residential applications.
The novel heat pump can purportedly reach higher temperatures than existing heat pumps, without the need for refrigerants. It works with a high-fidelity (Hi-Fi) speaker powered by electricity that creates an acoustic wave in a closed-pressure vessel filled with helium at a pressure of 30 bars. The acoustic wave causes the gas to compress or expand, displacing heat from a lower temperature to a higher temperature, or vice versa. The heat pump core is filled with water, which absorbs or releases that heat.
“The acoustic wave does the work of compression and expansion of the gas that produces heat or cold, respectively,” Philippe Loyer, a product manager at Equium, told pv magazine.
Loyer said the heat pump can generate domestic water at up to 80 C. He claims that one of the key benefits of the acoustic heat pump, in comparison with traditional units using refrigerants, is its ability to reach very high or low temperatures.
“Traditional heat pumps use refrigerants with a temperature phase. They a have temperature limit, which is the temperature of the changing phase from liquid to gas of the refrigerant,” said Loyer. “In our core, the helium stays in gas form. Because helium remains a gas until -200 C, we can achieve higher temperatures inside our heat pump core.”
The heat pump purportedly works with all external heat sources, including air sources from -15 C to 50 C. Given that its core is filled with water, it works best as a water-source and geothermal heat pump. To be used as an air-source heat pump, the unit can be equipped with a fan that transfers the heat from the air to the water, according to Loyer.
The heat pump has a coefficient of performance (COP) of three to four, which means that it produces 3 kW to 4 kW of heat for each kilowatt of power it consumes. Equium is targeting 8 kW to 10 kW of thermal power for its heat pump core, Loyer said. It has a 30-year lifetime, with an easy installation process. The acoustic heat pump also offers better modulation than traditional units.
“We have the same efficiency as traditional heat pumps, but we have better modulation thanks to acoustic transfer,” said Loyer.
Traditional fixed-output units cycle between on and off multiple times a day, switching between zero and maximum capacity to achieve the right temperature balance. But the new heat pump modulates its output to continuously provide the desired temperature.
“The output regulation of a classical heat pump is very energy consuming. On our acoustic system, the regulation is very easy,” Loyer explained. “If you want less power, you can just decrease the volume of the Hi-Fi speaker.”
Equium claims that the heat pump system is completely silent, despite the use of a speaker to generate the acoustic wave. The level of noise is reportedly lower than 30 dB – the equivalent of a whisper.
“The sound our system produces stays confined inside the core, so you cannot hear it from outside,” said Loyer.
Equium is now conducting field tests for its thermos-acoustic heat pump. It expects to launch it at the end of 2023.
*This article was amended on 03/01/2023 to reflect that the helium is at a pressure of 30 bars and that it remains a gas until -200 C, not -300 C as previously reported.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/02/new-electrolyzer-to-split-saltwater-into-hydrogen/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 2, 2023",New electrolyzer to split saltwater into hydrogen,"Researchers from Shenzhen University and Nanjing Tech University in China have developed a seawater electrolysis system (SES) for the direct electrolysis of seawater, without side reactions or corrosion.
The new method works via self-driven water migration to sidestep the need for a separate desalination process. The energy consumption is purportedly comparable to that of industrial alkaline electrolysis with pure water.
To develop the lab-scale electrolyzer, the scientists separated the two electrode layers with a diaphragm layer and then submerged them in a concentrated hydroxide (OH−) solution – the SDE. They placed a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane between the seawater and the SDE. They claim this design allows the biased diffusion of water vapor, but fully prevents the penetration of liquid seawater and impurity ions such as magnesium, chloride and sulfate.
“During operation, the difference in water vapor pressure between the seawater and the SDE across the membrane provides a driving force for spontaneous seawater gasification (evaporation) at the seawater side and the diffusion of water vapor through the short gas path inside the membrane to the SDE side, where it is re-liquified by absorption by the SDE,” the scientist explained.
The consumption of water in the SDE during electrolysis maintains the pressure difference across the membrane, ensuring the continuous entry of freshwater, without extra energy consumption.
“When the water migration rate equals the electrolysis rate, a new thermodynamic equilibrium is established between the seawater and the SDE, and continuous and stable water migration through a ‘liquid-gas-liquid’ mechanism is realized to provide fresh water for electrolysis,” the researchers said.
The lab-scale electrolyzer steadily produced hydrogen from seawater for more than 72 hours, with average voltages of approximately 1.95 V and 2.3 V at current densities of 250 mA cm−2 and 400 mA cm−2, respectively. After 72 hours, the concentrations of chloride, sulfate, and magnesium impurities were only 0.008%, 0.052%, and 0.089% of the original.
“Calculations show that the electricity expense of [hydrogen] production is approximately 4.6 kWh Nm-3H2 and 5.3 kWh Nm-3H2 at current densities of 250 mA cm−2 and 400 mA cm−2, respectively, which is comparable to that of industrial alkaline electrolysis with pure water,” the scientists claimed.
To prove the concept, they fabricated a scaled-up SES measuring 82 cm x 62 cm x 70.5 cm. It reportedly exhibited stable performance for more than 3,200 hours and energy consumption of approximately 5.0 kWh Nm-3H2, with no detectable increase in impurity ions.
The scientists said their method can be further developed by using other electrolytes able to absorb water vapor and conduct ions, or high-performance electrocatalysts able to operate in the SDE environment. They added that the strategy could be applied to other non-volatile liquids like highly concentrated acid, alkali and salt solutions for use in industrial wastewater treatment.
In addition, it could be used to produce hydrogen while recovering useful resources such as lithium from water. Further research is also needed for the electrolyzer's compatibility with renewable energy sources to match that of conventional electrolyzers.
The scientists shared their findings in “A membrane-based seawater electrolyser for hydrogen generation,” which was recently published in Nature.
