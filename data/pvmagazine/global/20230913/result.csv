The vote resulted in 470 in favor, 120 against, and 40 abstentions.
The updated directive on renewable energy sources, already agreed upon by MEPs, awaits formal approval by the Council to take effect. The EU aims for renewable energy to constitute 42.5% of final energy consumption by 2030, with Member States striving for 45%.
The legislation also streamlines permitting for new renewable energy facilities, stipulating that national authorities should approve installations in “renewable-friendly zones” within 12 months and not exceed 24 months outside these areas.
In the transport sector, the implementation of renewables aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 14.5% by 2030.
Member states will set an indicative target of at least 5% for innovative renewable energy technologies in newly installed capacity and establish a binding framework for cross-border energy projects.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/13/europe-needs-e30-billion-by-2027-to-rebuild-pv-says-agora-energiewende/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,EUROPE",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2023","Europe needs €30 billion by 2027 to rebuild PV, says Agora Energiewende","Europe depends heavily on imports of clean technologies such as solar photovoltaics or batteries.
“Recent events demonstrate that it would be naive to take the security of supply of critical raw materials, refined materials, components or clean-tech end products for granted,” German think tank Agora Energiewende said in the new “Ensuring resilience in Europe’s energy transition” report.
Europe's transition to climate neutrality requires a rapid increase in solar, onshore wind, offshore wind, batteries, heat pumps, and electrolyzers, said Agora Energiewende. Based on an analysis by Roland Berger, it recommends a package of measures to grow the EU's clean-tech manufacturing industry.
“Greater resilience will come from diversifying supplies through domestic extraction and international strategic partnerships, improving the circularity of materials, and increasing the production of clean technologies in Europe,” the report reads.
The analysis proposes minimum clean technology production quotas in the EU “as insurance against supply chain risks.”
To bring the EU manufacturing industry to these levels, estimates suggest that public financing ranging from €10 billion to €30 billion will be required until 2027 and an additional €32.9 billion to €94.5 billion from 2028 to 2034.
“The technology-specific targets set in the Net Zero Industry Act for batteries, wind and electrolyzers are high and would require more public funding,” said Agora Energiewende.
Europe now needs a credible approach to close the production cost gap, reach acritical scale, and develop local supply networks.
“To ensure long-term competitiveness without support, dedicated public funding should be part of a broader policy package including access to finance, competition on quality (including sustainability), a robust pipeline for clean technologies and investments in innovation,” said Agora Energiewende.
It said EU countries should try to attract major clean technology suppliers to establish production in Europe.
“To achieve a gradual derisking of current value chain dependencies, offers of support should however be accompanied by guarantees that ensure a lasting commitment from companies deciding to establish production in Europe,” it said.
Agora Energiewende adds that the European Commission's reform proposal would lead to less aggressive fiscal consolidation in high-debt countries compared to the old rules.
“Unfortunately, the Commission's reform proposal does not sufficiently protect public investments, especially when it comes to a structural and permanent increase in public spending, as in the cases of industrial policy and climate change mitigation,” said Agora Energiewende. “For example, the proposed reform would require Italy to achieve a primary surplus of 2.8% to 3.2% of GDP by 2027, equivalent to a fiscal adjustment of €18 billion to €27 billion.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/13/new-figures-provide-clarity-on-solar-module-glut-dumping-prices/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2023","New figures provide clarity on solar module glut, ‘dumping’ prices","The statements made by some market participants about quantities of Chinese solar modules in EU warehouses, rock-bottom prices and suspected “dumping” practices are increasing and somehow diverging from each other.
A classification based on numbers may help us to understand the new reality of the rapidly growing global PV market, which is poised for further expansion this year.
Global production capacity in terms of GW, modules
2019: 118 GW or around 340 million modules
2023: 380 GW or about 844 million modules
EU market in GW, modules
2019: 16.7 GW, or around 48 million modules per year, 4 million modules per month
2023 (optimistic scenario): 80 GW or 178 million modules per year, 14.8 million modules per month
EU module inventory “normal” (two-month cycle)
2019: 2.8 GW, or around 8 million modules
2023: 13.3 GW, or around 30 million modules
Inventories in the double-digit gigawatt range in the European Union are the new “normal” in an ever-growing PV market. “Horror scenarios” of 120 GW in EU warehouses by the end of the year would mean 290 million modules in warehouses.
Inventory values of modules (base €0.15/W)
1 GW = €150 million ($161 million)
10 GW = €1.5 billion
120 GW = €18 billion
“Horror scenarios” of 120 GW in EU warehouses would therefore require almost €18 billion of “dead” capital. How will this be financed? The new “normal” requires capital.
Purchasing prices for large PV projects in Germany
2019/20: €0.16W to €0.19/W
September 2023: €0.15W to €0.17/W
Price reduction based on the PV learning curve
2019-23: €0.04/W to €0.06/W
After roughly looking at the photovoltaic learning curve, the expected price in 2023 would be between €0.10/W to €0.15/W.
Solar module costs according to a document published by the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) on Sept. 11
EU stock: €0.33/W
EU: €0.299/W
China: €0.254/W
Solar module costs (excluding margins) from an ESMC member (as of the end of 2022)
EU: €0.198/W
China: €0.169/W
Share of silicon produced in China from Xinjiang (estimates for 2023):
Around 30%
The 380 GW of new PV installations expected throughout the world in 2023 could be produced entirely without silicon from China's Xinjiang region.
Variable costs for polysilicon
Global average: $8.20/kg
Wacker (Germany): $18/kg
Success in climate protection
Modules in 2019-20 were mostly up to around 350 W and based on monocrystalline PERC technology. Currently, monofacial, monocrystalline PERC modules are slowly being phased out, with PV technologies such as TOPCon and heterojunction that are taking over the market for projects, with module outputs of up to 575 W.
Chinese module suppliers have grown rapidly since 2019 to supply this impressive global market. And the learning curve in production continued – the modules are much more efficient now and PERC products are destined to disappear from the market. What a success for global climate protection, which cannot be achieved with the current EU policy.

CNR is leading a consortium in the development of “Ombrières PHotovoltaïquE grand LIneAire”, a solar shading project along the ViaRhôna cycling route in southern France's Caderousse department, alongside the Rhône River.
The pilot project aims to evaluate the integration of a PV facility into the landscape and assess its energy performance. The project partners include French cable supplier Nexans, Schneider Electric, railway operator SNCF, and the SuperGrid Institute.
The PV system will span 900 meters in length and have an installed capacity of 900 kW. It will consist of 30 shaded structures with west-east oriented solar panels.
The consortium will conduct tests on the system's overall architecture and the equipment needed for transporting medium voltage direct current (MVDC) electricity to the delivery point. Construction and testing are scheduled for the 2025-28 period, following a three-year phase of engineering studies, research and development (R&D), and prototyping.
“Direct current represents a new technological horizon in medium voltage after more than a hundred years of development in alternating current,” said Christophe Prévé, chief technical officer of medium voltage offers at Schneider Electric. “It should allow better integration into the networks of certain applications such as the installation of large photovoltaic linear arrays, promoting significant development of renewable energies while avoiding the artificialization of land.”
One of the project's challenges will be minimizing electrical losses due to the long length of the cables, in order to allow the development of projects longer than 20 km.
“By experimenting with the use of solar panels on a large length, the project is paving the way for the enhancement of the surroundings of railway lines,” said Carole Desnost, vice-president of technologies, innovation and projects for SNCF.
In July, the railroad operator launched a subsidiary, SNCF Renewables, to develop 1 GW of solar power by 2030.

“Smartly blending the wealth of PV energy with the advanced features of inverters can maximize the benefits of PV systems,” said Venizelos Efthymiou, Director of EPL Technology Frontiers, Cyprus and ETIP PV Member. “For instance, digitalized PV systems can significantly improve the availability of flexibility on the demand side and the interconnection of the grid on the supply side. I am highly motivated to share these thoughts with you, but also truly interested to hear your thoughts on how we can build more forward-looking concepts!”
The first parallel event will take place on Wednesday, the 20th of September. Named “Reliable and friendly integration of next-generation PV plants in EU Grids”, it will present innovations developed in European projects at SERENDI-PV, TRUST-PV, and ETIP-PV. Two core challenges will be discussed in two different sessions.
In the first session on “High PV integration into utility girds and markets” (from 15:15 until 16.30), Venizelos Efthymiou from EPL Technology Frontiers will talk on behalf of ETIP-PV on the topic of “Flexibility facilitating optimal high penetration of PV systems”. The second session on “Reliable and friendly integration of next-generation plants in EU grids” (from 17:00 to 18:30) will welcome speakers from SERENDI-PV and TRUST-PV only.
The second parallel event named “Data, AI, IoT: Opportunities and Challenges for PV Innovation” is organized independently by ETIP-PV and will take place on Thursday, 21st of September from 17:00 to 18:00 o’clock. This session will discuss the challenges and opportunities that arise from large data, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) in PV innovation.
The ETIP PV’s Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) provides a fundamental basis for this discussion. For instance, the discussion will cover the SRIA’s first challenge on the digitalization of PV manufacturing and systems, and the fourth challenge on aggregated energy and VPPs and interoperability in the communication and operation of RES smart grids. As such, this parallel event will outline how we can improve the reliability and penetration of PV energy systems via a more intelligent distribution, dependable and openly available forecasting tools, and improved efficiencies by integrating hybrid PV systems in DC networks.
Last, but not least, Peter Fath from RCT-Solutions, Konstanz, Germany, and a member of ETIP-PV will also talk on the topic of “PV manufacturing ecosystem in Europe” on Wednesday, 20th of September,
At 13:30 in Room 5A, Auditorium 4. This session will discuss the need for local European PV manufacturing, the role of research and innovation in the creation of a European supply and value chain, as well as the necessary measures to create competitive PV manufacturing in Europe.
Attending all of these events is only possible with a purchased ticket for EU-PVSEC. Additionally, the two above-mentioned parallel events require registration for logistics purposes, so hurry up to save your seats.

However, in order to unlock the technology’s full potential, further effort is needed toward the development of advanced control strategies.
In order to enhance the stability and anti-interference ability of vanadium redox flow batteries in microgrids, a group of researchers led by the University of Western Australia have developed a novel learning-based data-driven H∞ control approach.
The control strategy uses an integral reinforcement learning algorithm to produce excellent steady-state and dynamic responses only by measurements. Compared to model-based control methods, it is insensitive to model parameter variations, according to the researchers.
Furthermore, compared to most of the existing artificial intelligent control approaches that require large amounts of experimental data for offline neural network training, the proposed control strategy contributes to eliminating the offline training process and therefore, does not need the costly and tedious training data acquisition process.
Importantly, the proposed control offers guaranteed closed-loop control stability, which cannot be achieved by nearly all the control methods that purely rely on the offline trained neural networks.
“While ensuring excellent online control performance, the proposed method overcomes the defects of existing vanadium redox flow battery control methods, such as model dependence and inability to train online,” the researchers said.
In their paper, they provide proof of stability and claim to verify the superiority of the proposed control method by the demonstrations of simulation results and quantitative analysis. They discussed their findings in “A novel learning-based data-driven H∞ control strategy for vanadium redox flow battery in DC microgrids,” which was recently published in Journal of Power Sources.

“We have not forgotten how China's unfair trade practices affected our solar industry,” she said. “Many young businesses were pushed out by heavily subsidized Chinese competitors. Pioneering companies had to file for bankruptcy. Promising talents went searching for fortune abroad. This is why fairness in the global economy is so important – because it affects lives and livelihoods.”
Von der Leyen did not say which specific measures might be adopted to avoid market distortions in the PV sector. However, she said that the European Union will not accept that prices will be kept “artificially” low by state subsidies.
“And as we do not accept this from the inside, we do not accept this from the outside,” she said. “So I can announce today that the Commission is launching an anti-subsidy investigation into electric vehicles coming from China.”
SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger praised the commissioner's “commitment to critical industry made in Europe.” However, Hemetsberger noted that “this promise must translate into action. Solar project developers face inflation-driven headwinds. Europe’s solar manufacturers are at risk of bankruptcy.”

The novel solution is intended for use in residential and industrial applications requiring additional low-temperature waste heat and intermittent control strategies. “This system is currently a prototype but we are now constructing a more efficient version,” the research's corresponding author, Jacek S. Leszczynski, told pv magazine.
The system consists of a compressor, a piston, a piston rod, a connecting rod, a mechanical crank, and a crankshaft. It also utilizes a thermal energy storage (TES) unit to improve the controllability of the compressed air expansion process performance via pulse width modulation (PWM). The latter is a method that is commonly utilized to control analog devices, using a digital signal.
The storage section of the system comprises an isobaric tank that stores compressed air in the form of mechanical energy and the TES unit, which stores the heat generated during compression. A pulse heat exchanger controlled by PWM is used to heat the compressed air portions and a system of flow control valves. The mechanical crank system is then linked via a gear to an electrical power generator.

“The expansion section includes drive elements in the form of actuators that convert the mechanical energy of the compressed air into mechanical energy of the reciprocating motion of the piston and piston rod,” the scientists explained. “This section expands the compressed air into the atmosphere after work in the actuator chamber.”
The academics conducted an analysis of the system performance with a multiple drive with the aim of assessing its effects on the air expander operation. “It was decided to present a comparison of the air expander dynamics consisting of one, three, five and seven linear drives, for which the sum of piston diameter is equal in each case,” they specified, adding that the analysis considered generated power, shaft rotational speed, air consumption, and volume flows.
The test showed that the multi-drive system not only raises the unit’s efficiency but also stabilizes the rotational speed, which in turn increases the generated electrical power. “The three-drive expander had the highest electrical power compared to the five- and seven-drive expanders, and much lower electrical power fluctuation than the single-drive expander,” they also noted.
The researchers also found that the system's optimal duty cycle of air-supplied PWM control is 0.5, which results in an electrical power of 1.1 kW and energy efficiency of 65% for the air expander.
This duty cycle, in their view, has the ability to control the electric power while maintaining an acceptable overall efficiency value. “In the analyzed case, the range of electric power variability was 500–1800 W, i.e. from 20 to 75% of maximum power with a change in overall efficiency from 90 to 100% of the maximum efficiency,” they said.
The system was presented in the study “Analysis of optimal expansion dynamics in a reciprocating drive for a micro-CAES production system,” published in Applied Energy.

R. Ambedkar National Institute of Technology Jalandhar in India have developed a new system relying on a humidification-dehumidification and vapor compression refrigeration (HDH-VCR) cycle and a PV-powered heat pump. The system is intended for the production of desalinated freshwater, cooling, and hot water.
The scientists explained that the proposed system uses the integrated refrigerator and heat pump's cooling and heating energies for its operation. “The plant also has the ability to generate cool air or hot air depending on the season,” they explained. “The cooling from the evaporator of a heat pump is used for the final dehumidification of air.”
This system consists of a PV system, heat pump, fans, air preheaters, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air reheaters, solar water heaters (SWHs), and water circulation pumps. The working fluid in the VCR is R410A. “The solar PV power plant supplies power to the fan, vapor compressor, and pumps. Water cooling condensers (heat pumps) and SWH provide hot water to humidifiers, air preheaters, and air preheating systems,” the researchers said.
In order to produce cool air, as well as fresh and heated water, the system utilizes the HDH-VCR cycle. HDH is commonly used to control humidity levels in the air stream, first humidifying the air, and then removing surplus moisture. VCR is a process in which a refrigerant changes states between liquid and vapor to absorb heat and cool the air.
“The unique features of the plant are the arrangement of all the two-stage humidification-dehumidification components in a vertical tower, and the easy flow of the fluids in the duct,” the academics explained. “The process design has the potential for application in the residential and industrial sectors.”
They tested the system through a series of theoretical simulations and via a prototype that was tested under real conditions. They found that the system is able to generate up to 5.5 l per hour (LPH) of fresh water, up to 6.8 kW of cooling effect, and up to 4.2 energy performance ratio (EPR) at the air flow rate of 1,000 m3/h. The EPR is the ratio of primary product energy plus its by-product energy.
“The use of refrigerating effects and heat rejection of a heat pump enhances the coefficient of performance (COP) of the system,” the scientists said, without providing specific figures.
They presented the system in the study “Experimental and simulation studies on heat pump integration two stage desalination and cooling system,” which was published in Energy Nexus.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/13/how-long-do-residential-solar-inverters-last-3/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2023",How long do residential solar inverters last?,"From pv magazine USA
In the first part of this series, pv magazine reviewed the productive lifespan of solar panels, which are quite resilient. In this part, we look at residential solar inverters in their various forms, how long they last, and how resilient they are.
Inverters, which convert the DC power produced by solar panels into usable AC power, come in a few different configurations.  The two main types of inverters in residential applications are string inverters and microinverters.
In some applications, string inverters are equipped with module-level power electronics (MLPE) called DC optimizers. Microinverters and DC optimizers are generally used for roofs with shading conditions or sub-optimal orientation (not south-facing).
In applications where the rooftop has a preferable azimuth (orientation to the sun) and little no shading issues, a string inverter can be a good solution.
String inverters generally come with simplified wiring and a centralized location for easier repairs by solar technicians. Typically they are less expensive, according to Solar Reviews. Inverters can typically cost 10% to 20% of a total solar panel installation, so choosing the right one is important.
While solar panels can last 25 to 30 years or more, inverters generally have a shorter life, due to more rapidly aging components. A common source of failure in inverters is the electro-mechanical wear on the capacitor in the inverter. The electrolyte capacitors have a shorter lifetime and age faster than dry components, said Solar Harmonics.
EnergySage said that a typical centralized residential string inverter will last about 10 to 15 years, and thus will need to be replaced at some point during the panels’ life.
String inverters generally have standard warranties ranging from 5-10 years, many with the option to extend to 20 years. Some solar contracts include free maintenance and monitoring through the term of the contract, so it is wise to evaluate this when selecting inverters.
Microinverters have a longer life, EnergySage said they can often last 25 years, nearly as long as their panel counterparts. Roth Capital Partners said its industry contacts generally report microinverter failures at a substantially lower rate than string inverters, though the upfront cost is generally a bit higher in microinverters.
Microinverters typically have a 20 to 25-year standard warranty included. It should be noted that while microinverters have a long warranty, they are still a relatively new technology from the past ten years or so, and it remains to be seen if the equipment will fulfill its 20+ year promise.
The same goes for DC optimizers, which are typically paired with a centralized string inverter. These components are designed to last for 20 to 25 years and have a warranty to match that time period.

In this type of hybrid system, an upstream reservoir is connected to a downstream reservoir, and the FPVs can be installed on each reservoir.
“This study aims to highlight how operation under round-the-clock tariff-based and varying energy pricing with and without load commitments affects the optimal dimensioning of the grid-connected utility-scale hybrid system,” the scientists said, noting that hybridizing utility-scale PV with hydropower can be “a feasible way to reduce the seasonal variability in renewable energy generation.”
The study found that annual producer profits for a hybridized hydro system increased by 18-21% and 0-4% for a three-tariff power purchase agreement (PPA) scheme and spot market scheme, respectively, compared with a hydro-only system in sub-Saharan African market conditions. It also found that hybridization with single-axis tracking GPVs can be a “techno-economically more feasible option compared to the FPV system” due to the lower capex and higher energy yield of the GPV.
“Furthermore, it is estimated that the capex of FPV should be around 42–57% lower than that of ground-mounted PV (GPV) with single-axis tracking for the hydro-FPV system to reach the same annual producer profit as the hydro-GPV system,” the researchers explained.
They based the techno-economic assumptions for both the FPV and GPV systems on estimates from the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s cost benchmarking for PV systems, with capital and fixed operating expenses related to the incumbent hydro system being considered sunk costs. For the power market condition inputs, the paper used historical Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) spot price market data from 2014 to 2021.
The case study also assumes the connection of the hybrid system with the national grid, with a maximum power output of 126 MW. In addition, the paper proposes a “linear programming model for optimal dimensioning/scheduling of a hybrid hydro-FPV system.”
During a dry weather year, hydro plant hybridization with FPVs can compensate for the reduced hydropower output, resulting in a 4% increase in annual producer profits. In wet weather years, however, hybridization of the hydro plant with FPV was not observed to be economically feasible, while in median years, only a negligible increase in annual producer profits (less than 0.1%) can be achieved, due to grid capacity limits on the potential for the FPV to participate in the spot market during peak price hours. “Moreover, the hydro-GPV system is observed to generate higher annual producer profits compared to the hydro-FPV system in all analyzed scenarios (around 13–18%),” the paper noted.
The findings are available in the report “Techno-economic feasibility of hybrid hydro-FPV systems in Sub-Saharan Africa under different market conditions,” published in Renewable Energy.
“The results highlight the effects of different market schemes and varying weather years on the hybrid system dimensioning and operation. However, in the long-term modeling, the robustness of the results could be improved by including stochastic optimization methods in the techno-economic analysis of the hybrid-FPV systems,” the researchers concluded.
