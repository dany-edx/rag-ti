In March 2019, the South Korean photovoltaic company filed lawsuits against Longi Solar, Jinko Solar and REC in Germany, the USA and Australia.
These manufacturers are said to have infringed existing patents held by Hanwha Q-Cells for its passivated solar cell technology. The defendant photovoltaic manufacturers claim the validity of their patents which are currently being reviewed by the European, Chinese, and US patent offices.
While Hanwha Q-Cells' patent infringement lawsuit was rejected in the USA, the judges at the Düsseldorf Regional Court in Germany ruled in the first instance in favor of the South Korean photovoltaic manufacturer. Longi Solar appealed this ruling and has now said that an appeal hearing is scheduled for April 22, 2021.
According to Longi Solar, in October of last year, the European Patent Office published a notice stating that “if the current applications are retained, the patent would be revoked in full”. In the event of a complete revocation, Longi Solar assumes that the patent infringement proceedings would be suspended “with a very high degree of probability”. However, the reference is only an important indicator and not binding for the decision of the European Patent Office.
The Chinese patent office, where the validity of the patent is also being reviewed, has only made a provisional decision so far, according to which the patent CN 1091952971 should be maintained to a limited extent. Only in the USA were parts of the patent US 9,893,215 finally revoked in December 2020, as Longi Solar reported. There is still no decision on the proceedings in Australia.
REC also commented on the ongoing patent dispute on Wednesday. The Chinese Patent Office has confirmed the validity of its patent for the technology with split cells and junction boxes. The manufacturer produces these at its plant in Singapore. REC also filed a patent infringement suit against a Chinese Hanwha subsidiary in February 2020 to protect its own patents. The Chinese patent office published its decision on January 4, 2021, after Hanwha Q-Cells filed a counterclaim to examine the validity of the REC patents. REC has also filed a lawsuit against its South Korean competitor in the USA. This took place in November 2020 at the US District Court in Delaware.

Located at the heart of the Total biorefinery in La Mède, the 40 MW electrolyzer will produce 5 tonnes of green hydrogen per day, meeting the needs of the biofuel production process at the site, and avoiding 15,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.
The electrolyzer will be powered by solar PV parks with a total capacity of over 100 MW, the two companies said in a joint statement. In addition, an innovative management solution for the production and storage of hydrogen will be implemented to manage the intermittent production of solar electricity and the need for continuous power of the biorefinery.
The project incorporates five innovations that foreshadow industry decarbonization solutions that are “unprecedented in Europe,” the designers said. These include a digital control system for the continuous supply of hydrogen with real-time management of solar electricity production, an optimization of the integration of several photovoltaic farms to minimize energy losses and limit network congestion, and large-scale hydrogen storage to balance intermittent electricity production with continuous hydrogen consumption.
In addition, a direct current connection will link a photovoltaic farm and the electrolyzer to improve the energy balance. Finally, the two entities will implement enhanced industrial safety through the use of 3D digital models for each component of the installation.
Total and Engie stated that after a pilot phase will be implemented, new renewable energy plants could be developed by their partners for the electrolyzer, which has the capacity to produce up to 15 tonnes of green hydrogen per day.
The Masshylia project has been labeled as innovative and of strategic interest for the region by several regional institutions, including the Provence-Alpes-Côte d´Azur regional government, the Aix-Marseille-Provence administration and the Capenergies competitiveness cluster. It is also being supported by local players for its ability to reduce CO2 emissions and demonstrate the economic benefits of renewable hydrogen as well as for its integration into the local ecosystem, the two energy companies said.
The partners aim to start construction of the facilities in 2022, following the end of an advanced engineering study, with a view to production in 2024, subject to the establishment of the necessary financial support and public authorizations. To this end, the project has already submitted grant applications to the relevant French and European authorities.

Companies hoping to get a stake in the massively growing energy sector come away empty-handed. 
After seven long years, the European Union and China finally concluded their Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), in late December. Criticism came in quickly within Brussels and other European capitals, amid claims the CAI fails to appropriately address the forced labor situation of the Muslim Uyghur minority in China and that the final push to the finish line came at the behest of Germany, which leveraged its presidency of the European Commission and Council of the European Union.
The investment pact seeks to establish legal grounds for European companies to compete on a level playing field in China. European policymakers argue that the deal would provide unprecedented access to the Chinese market. Hitherto, European investors struggled to make foreign direct investments (FDI) in certain Chinese industries or without a technology transfer to a Chinese partner. Even in those industries where FDI was generally possible, IP protection was inadequate, as were bilateral dispute settlement mechanisms.
Around €7 billion of the cumulative FDI from Europe to China, accrued over the last two decades, went into the energy sector. This figure will likely not grow on the back of the agreement, as the energy sector has been left untouched by the agreement. 
Previously existing legal uncertainties and lack of investment protection or discriminatory economic practices remain. So far, China's energy market has been largely closed to foreign companies and investors. 
With China's government having recently pledged to decarbonize its economy by 2060, a boost in demand for renewable energy projects is anticipated. Also, the 14th five-year plan, scheduled for publication later this month, is expected to incorporate ambitious targets on renewable energy and non-internal combustion engine vehicles.
In the sectors pertinent to the agreement, European businesses will enjoy more legal certainty, predictability and be accorded legal remedy if required, the statement asserts. Also, discriminatory economic practices that prevent European companies from meaningfully engaging in commerce in China will be ruled out with the CAI in place.
While direct stakes in China's booming energy sector remain a risky business, manufacturing is among the sectors included in the deal. With the CAI, the EU claims, it will be easier for EU based companies to set up shop in China and enjoy an explicit prohibition of mandatory transfers of technology, a practice by which foreign manufacturers are compelled to share proprietary business and product information. In addition, improved access to China's market will also be granted by providing equal access to standard-setting bodies for EU companies and enjoy more robust transparency on rules for regulatory and administrative measures.  
Over the last 20 years, FDI from the EU to China reached a cumulative €140 billion, with Chinese FDI into the EU reaching €120 billion. The level of bilateral FDI remains small, the EU claims, given the two massive markets' size and financial might. Europe's FDI into the US in 2019 alone reached $2.8 trillion, with the latter investing $3.5 trillion into Europe that same year.
“Today's agreement is an important landmark in our relationship with China and for our values-based trade agenda,” President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen said. “It will provide unprecedented access to the Chinese market for European investors, enabling our businesses to grow and create jobs. It will also commit China to ambitious principles on sustainability, transparency, and non-discrimination. The agreement will rebalance our economic relationship with China”.
Manufacturing opportunities
In the sectors covered, European businesses will gain certainty and predictability for their operations as China will no longer be able to prohibit access or introduce new discriminatory practices. These sectors include manufacturing, the automotive industry, financial services, health, R&D of biological resources, telecommunications, computer services, international maritime transport, air-transport related services, business services, environmental services, and construction services. 
The CAI covers China's extensive fleet of state-owned enterprises. China has agreed that information can be made available upon request to prove that such enterprises have acted in conformity with the agreement.
Disputes under the agreement will be solved in a state-to-state dispute settlement mechanism, which will be accompanied by a monitoring mechanism for pre-litigation phase issue solving at the political level.
“This deal will give European businesses a major boost in one of the world's biggest and fastest-growing markets, helping them to operate and compete in China,” executive vice-president and commissioner for trade Valdis Drombovskis said. “It also anchors our values-based trade agenda with one of our largest trading partners. We have secured binding commitments on the environment, climate change, and combatting forced labor. We will engage closely with China to ensure that all commitments are honored fully.”
 Uyghur region
Several human rights bodies, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the UN Human Rights Council have accused China's government of engaging in forced labor practices against the Xinjiang province's Muslim Uyghur minority. 
The matter promises to impact the solar sector in a similar manner as it has impacted the textile and consumer electronics industries over the course of last year. The production of certain raw materials and components used in a range of solar hardware is carried out in Xinjiang province. 
Members of the minority are reportedly sent to labor camps within Xinjiang, but also elsewhere. Human rights organizations believe that more than 1 million Uyghurs are being detained in labor camps, with their children reportedly subjected to “re-education” programs. The official Chinese position on these matters is a mixture of denial and the claim that “re-education” camps fulfill the need to de-radicalize the Muslim population.
The EU Commission contends that as part of its obligations under the CAI Beijing is on course to ratify respective international treaties, which explicitly prohibit the practice of forced labor, and that China will effectively implement the International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions it has already ratified. Of the 190 ILO Conventions, China has ratified 26, though it has legally denounced five of those and abrogated another one, meaning that only 20 are in force. Whether ratification of Convention No. 122, on Employment Policy and No. 29, on Forced Labour would spell an end to the labor camps is another question.
“China also commits to working towards the ratification of the outstanding ILO (International Labour Organisation) fundamental Conventions and takes specific commitments in relation to the two ILO fundamental conventions on forced labor that it has not ratified yet,” the EU announcement reads, without specifying further which specific commitments and actions China will take, and what will happen if China fails to adhere to such standards.
Solar not guilt-free
In March 2020, a lengthy report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute titled Uyghurs for sale – ‘Re-education,' forced labor and surveillance beyond Xinjiang was published. The researchers lay out a grim picture of the practice and list 83 companies which they claim have exploited Uyghur forced labor, also beyond the Xinjiang province, through forced resettlement. 
AcBel Polytech Co. Ltd, for example, produces DC/DC and AC/DC converter stages, but the manufacturer has not disclosed its list of customers. Avary Holding Co. Ltd. makes printed circuit boards and has been accused of forced labor of 111 people. Jinan Gude Electronic Device Co. Ltd. manufactures diodes, rectifiers, and semiconductors – components that can be found in solar inverters. Similarly, Sichuan Mianyang Jingweida Technology Co. Ltd and Ningbo Aoboer Electric Appliance Co. Ltd. produce components utilized further downstream in the solar industry.
However, the Australian researchers were able to identify the customers of Hubei Yihong Precision Manufacturing Co. Ltd, a supplier of battery components. These include, companies such as Apple and Cisco, but also solar players like BYD, Toshiba, Kyocera, Huawei, Panasonic, and Siemens.
Apart from semiconductor and electrical components, Xinjiang is also popular with the world's polysilicon producers, which are attracted to the region by low energy prices. In fact, Xinjiang is host to about 40% of the world's polysilicon production.
Market intelligence provider S&P Global Market Intelligence reported in October 2020 that GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. disclosed in its “staff localization report” that it employs 120 workers from minorities in the region. The polysilicon producer responded to the allegations stating that its “Uyghur employees are provided with special benefits, including holidays and access to a halal restaurant.”
Similarly, Daqo New Energy Corp., another large Chinese polysilicon producer, has significant production capacity in Xinjiang. Repsonding to S&P Global Market Intelligence's investigation of the matter and inquiries as to Daqo's safeguard mechanisms to ensure no forced labor was used in its factories, the company stated: “The cities/region in question are in southern Xinjiang.”
One day after S&P Global Market Intelligence' reporting, Daqo issued a press release in which the company said: “The Company wishes to clarify that it does not tolerate any use of forced labor under any circumstances whether in its own facilities or throughout its entire supply chain. The company regularly monitors the compliance with its policies by its suppliers and will promptly address any issues if and when they arise.”
European Discord 
The European Commission's lackluster performance in addressing the issue more effectively was palpable in sessions of the European Parliament. MEPs raised a joint motion, sponsored by the Greens/EFA, S&D, ECR, Renew, and EPP caucuses, on December 19, 2020.
“The Commission has folded on the issue of workers' rights,” said Member of the European Parliament Reinhard Bütikofer (European Greens) and the chair of Parliament's delegation for relations with China. “It is ridiculous to try selling that as a success.”
In particular, Bütikofer criticized that the outcome of the negotiations with China fails to respect the parliament's criterion with regards to forced labor practices. In contrast, the “superficial lip service” of ratifying the ILO conventions would not suffice anyway; according to Bütikofer, it is particularly startling that the Commission failed to insist on a timeline for ratification and implementation.
It is not just Bütikofer of the Greens that voiced concerns over the new agreement. Guy Verhofstadt of the Renew Europe caucus was similarly outspoken against a premature signing of the deal without ensuring an end to the forced labor practice.
Criticism of the deal also regards it as a missed opportunity to rebuild the trusting transatlantic partnership with the incoming Biden Administration.
National Security Advisor appointee to President-elect Joe Biden, Jake Sullivan put out the incoming administration's hand to Brussels, expressing that the Biden-Harris administration had a great interest in developing a joint course of action in dealing with the issue of forced labor.

administration would welcome early consultations with our European
partners on our common concerns about China's economic
practices. https://t.co/J4LVEZhEld

That public comment was left unanswered by the European Commission.
“Explain why three weeks ago the EU — which likes to call itself the flag bearer of multilateralism — said it wants to coordinate with the Biden administration vis-à-vis China, and now it tries to push through this deal just before Biden is inaugurated as president,” Bütikofer adds.
The Commission fends off the criticism stating that the U.S. under the Trump administration reached a “Phase 1” trade deal with China without reaching out to the EU beforehand. The position in Brussels is that the CAI can be seen in part as an effort by the EU to ensure a level playing field with American investors after the conclusion of the “Phase 1” trade agreement.
Section 307 import bans
The United States has taken action with regards to the alleged Uyghur labor camps. Already in 2019, Florida Senator Marco Rubio introduced legislation with measures to provide some protection to Chinese Uyghurs. The Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act passed on September 22 and gave the Chinese government time to respond to the allegations with transparency and reporting. The 120 days period provided by the legislation elapses on January 20, 2021.
After the January 20 date specified, Section 307 of the Tariff Act will apply to goods from Xinjiang province, as part of the law prohibits the import of goods made in part or wholly by forced labor. With 40% of the world's solar polysilicon production located in Xinjiang, such import bans would significantly impact the Chinese solar industry. 
Official U.S. language regarding the measures is clear: “the U.S. Department of State, along with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a business advisory to caution businesses about the risks of supply chain links to entities that engage in human rights abuses, including forced labor, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang) and elsewhere in China.”
It's worth noting that the EU also stepped up its legal toolbox to address human rights issues. On December 7, 2020 the EU adopted Council Decision 2020/1999 and Regulation (EU) 2020/1998 (EU Global Human Rights sanctions regime), which for the first time allows the EU to impose non-country-based sanctions for human rights violations committed anywhere in the world. This new regime is part of the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy (2020-2024). While this new legislation is without doubt an improvement, it is also limited in that sanctions don't apply automatically and can only be imposed by unanimous country support within the Council of the European Union. A single vote against such sanctions on the grounds of forced labor allegations would thwart widespread support for such measures. With the Commission and Council now having sealed, in principle, the CAI this concern remains, and the Council has yet to show that it is ready to apply its new legal measures to this particular situation.
What's next? 
The deal reached during the video conference on December 30, 2020, is not complete and not set in stone. The EU and China will need to finalize the text, and on the EU side, the EU Council and Parliament will need to approve the agreement, with national parliament ratifications also necessary.  
It is likely that the discord within EU bodies will become increasingly loud and visible during these secondary processes. Much of the EU Parliament has supported the joint motion to push China harder to end forced labor, and the joint motion has been preceeded by individual motions from single caucuses of the parliament.
“The deal now proposed by the EU Commission is no deal until the European Parliament says it's a deal,” said Bütikofer. “The public debate on the advantages and disadvantages of the negotiated outcome must be as broad as possible in the run-up to it.”
In this vein, Guy Verhofstadt of the European Parliament's Renew caucus joins fellow MEP Bütikofer in raising doubts on the parliaments readiness to support the agreement. On Twitter Verhofstadt said that the “[European Parliament] would never ratify the China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment”. The MEP said that he needs commitments and proof of improvements of the human rights situation of among others the Uyghur population.

The Canada Infrastructure Bank (CIB) and Oneida Energy Storage LP, a joint venture between NRStor and Six Nations of the Grand River Development Corp., have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the Oneida Energy Storage project in Ontario.
According to the CIB, the proposed 250 MW/1,000 MWh energy storage facility represents the largest project of its kind in Canada. Once finished, it will also be among the largest battery storage projects in the world.
The MOU confirms the CIB’s plans to financially support of the project, with further due diligence and a final investment decision expected this spring. As a Canadian federal corporation, the CIB is mandated to invest CAD 35 billion ($27.5 billion) and attract private-sector dollars into projects that benefit the country. The CIB said this latest partnership is another step toward delivering clean power infrastructure under the corporation’s CAD 10 billion growth plan.
The Oneida Energy Storage project will draw and store existing surplus baseload and renewable energy during off-peak periods, and then release its energy into the Ontario grid during peak periods. The CIB said this will provide important grid-balancing services and create a more efficient and cost-effective electricity system for Ontario.
“Renewable energy projects in partnership with Indigenous communities – like the Oneida Energy Storage project with the CIB, Six Nations of the Grand River Development Corporation and NRStor – are a great example of how our economy will grow in the future and how forward-looking investments can help Canadians achieve their economic and environmental goals,” said Catherine McKenna, Canada’s minister of infrastructure and communities.

“This coating can be used for dry cleaning by robots in large PV plants,” company CEO, Rajbeer Singh, told pv magazine. “It increases the efficiency of wet cleaning by reducing water consumption in the range of 50 to 70% due to the self-cleaning function of the coating,” he said, noting that soiling, scaling, corrosion, abrasion and glass reflection can reduce transmission of light through the module glass in real field conditions in a range of 5% to 20%.
According to him, the coating solution can increase the performance of a PV power project by between 5 and 15% and ensure a reduced cost of cleaning and fewer damages to PV modules due to corrosion and operation and maintenance. “Our coating can reduce the cost of cleaning by 60%,” he explained, adding that revenue increase for a PV project in deserts and the polluted site could be in the range of 8 to 18%.
The technology is patented in the Netherlands and the coating production is planned to be located in India, wh
ere a factory is currently under construction. “As the coating is applied to the tempered cut size solar glass, the coating line can be installed with any solar glass manufacturer as well as PV module manufacturer,” Singh said. “The coating is applied through a chemical combustion vapor deposition (CCVD) process and this process makes it highly durable.” According to him, the coating could be applied directly to the module in a panel factory or onto the solar glass in a glass factory.
The coating has already shown extremely good results in real field conditions, according to Singh. It was applied manually to a solar park in Delhi, India, and tested during 2016 and 2021. The test showed that it helped the modules produce approximately 8.9% more power than non-coated modules located at the site.
“This product can be applied to the existing PV fields, which means the existing projects can get extra revenue and reduced cost of operations and maintenance,” the CEO continues. “Since water for cleaning is a serious challenge for all the existing big PV projects in water scarce regions, this coating can be a rescue for these projects”
 According to him, the cost of the coating through the coating line may represent between 2 and 3% of the total cost of a PV project.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/13/seawater-aqueous-battery-based-on-alloy-of-zinc-and-manganese/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FLORIDA,OREGON,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",MARK HUTCHINS,"JANUARY 13, 2021",Seawater aqueous battery based on alloy of zinc and manganese,"Aqueous batteries, that store energy in simple saltwater rather than complex organic solvents, are an attractive prospect for energy storage experts. These solvent-based electrolytes are often volatile and flammable and tend to degrade at high voltages. So replacing them with something as cheap, abundant, and fire-safe as seawater might seem like a no-brainer.
But this comes with its own set of problems. To date, aqueous battery technology has been held back by lower energy density compared to other battery technologies, as well as stability issues. Batteries with saltwater electrolytes are often prone to dendrite growth, and while this doesn’t come with a risk of fire as in standard lithium-ion technology it does still lead to performance loss and short-circuiting.
Scientists in the United States now claim to have overcome many of these issues using a new anode design. The group demonstrated this using a zinc-manganese alloy, though it says the approach could be extended to other metal alloys. “The use of the alloy with its special nanostructure not only suppresses dendrite formation by controlling the surface reaction thermodynamics and the reaction kinetics, said Zhenxing Feng, a chemical engineer at Oregon State University who worked on the research. “It also demonstrates super-high stability over thousands of cycles under harsh electrochemical conditions,”
Using these materials, with a 3D nanostructure on the anode’s surface, the group was able to much better control the reaction and avoid the formation of dendrites. To validate their approach, the group fabricated a battery and demonstrated stable, dendrite free cycling of the anode for 1,000 hours at a current density of 80mA/cm³. The work is described in the paper Stable, high-performance, dendrite free, seawater based aqueous batteries, published in Nature Communications.
Chemical observations
The paper also describes a new method developed by the group to observe in real-time the reactions happening at the anode, which should further improve their understanding of dendrite formation and other reactions taking place. This technique could also be applied to other battery concepts. “This platform provides us with the capability to directly image the electrode reaction dynamics in situ,” explained Xiaonan Shan, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Houston. “This important information provides direct evidence and visualization of the reaction kinetics and helps us to understand phenomena that could not be easily accessed previously.”
And though it’s a new discovery that will require a lot more testing to fully understand, the group has already begun to discuss the commercial potential of their approach. “Our theoretical and experimental studies proved that the 3D alloy anode has unprecedented interfacial stability, achieved by a favorable diffusion channel of zinc on the alloy surface,” Feng said. “The concept demonstrated in this collaborative work is likely to bring a paradigm shift in the design of high-performance alloy anodes for aqueous and non-aqueous batteries, revolutionizing the battery industry.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/13/spanish-pv-struggling-with-snowfalls-caused-by-storm-filomena/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",ALEJANDRO DIEGO ROSELL,"JANUARY 13, 2021",Spanish PV struggling with snowfalls caused by Storm Filomena,"From pv magazine Spain
Since January 8, approximately a third of the surface of Spain is covered in a dense, white blanket. It is not just “four flakes” or a few centimeters that will disappear in one day as on other occasions. This time, the snow is likely to cover the country for several days, due to the low temperatures and lack of rain.
This storm is going to have a significant impact on a multitude of photovoltaic plants located in communities like Castilla La Mancha, Madrid, Aragón and Castilla León and is, thus, raising a crucial question: How does snow affect PV performance?
The question is not new and there are already studies from the 1970s addressing the issue. In general, there is consensus that performance is affected, although it depends a lot on the orientation angle of the panels and the type of technology used.
According to a study published in 2013 by researchers at the University of Queens, the annual yield of crystalline solar panels in Southwest Ontario is reduced by up to 3.5% per year due to snow compared to a scenario in the same location without snow. In the opinion of experts dealing with this technology on a daily basis, such as Javier Asensio, CEO of Vector Renewables, a layer of only 3 or 4 centimeters of snow can make a conventional panel stop working completely. “If we add a cloudy sky to this, the performance is practically null or tending to irrelevance,” Asensio said.
According to Jesús Vega, a Spanish specialist in residential photovoltaics, although only a part of the panel is covered by snow and the rest is clean, it is usual for it to stop working completely. While standard solar modules are prepared for a common snowfall situation, as they usually include watertight compartments, problems can occur for various reasons. One of these is the poor calculation and design of the structures. In Vega's opinion, if the extra weight of the panels is added to the effect of the wind, breaks and twisting of the structure can occur. “It is something that we have seen with the trees of the city of Madrid – the mixture of extra weight and wind can split the wood,” the expert said.
The same problem is corroborated by Javier Asensio from Vector. “I have personally seen mounting systems and trackers in the United Kingdom that have flown in times of snow and this can happen in Spain,” he said. “We believe that an independent audit of the manufacturers is necessary in the design of the photovoltaic structures.”
According to Jesús Vega, other components that can fail are the junction boxes and inverters due to excessive humidity. “In principle, the inverters must be covered and should have IP65 protection,” he said. “There are installers and electricians who are unaware of the particularities of solar and often there are problems in which water seeps into the junction boxes that can turn into ice in these cases.” For Vega, in especially humid or tropical locations, IP 66 even IP 67 protection would be recommended.
The bifacial module technology appears to be generating consensus within the industry regarding its efficiency. If we add snow to the usual increase in performance due to the albedo effect, bifacial panels seem the optimal choice for areas with regular ice, snow or hail. However, according to Asensio, the improvement with snow is not very noticeable if the direct exposure surface is covered. “In the best case we are talking about a 15% performance increase in the back layer of the modules, which in the case of snow would generate something,” he said. “Even so, if the upper surface is not cleaned, it will still be a very low performance.”
In any case, the snow factor seems to have little weight in the choice between bifacial and monofacial products. “The technology is consolidating itself as mainstream and the increase in generation in times of snow with a bifacial can be important at a specific moment, but in the long term it is small,” Vega concluded. “EPC contractors opt for bifacials anyway and snow is not the decisive factor.”

The module measures 32 mm × 40 mm, with a thickness of 4.1 mm. It weighs in at 2.84 kg m2. It is based on a silicone concentrator lens, a thermoplastic polyurethane sheet, and a rigid III–V triple-junction solar cell.
“When perfectly fitted on a 3D curved surface with a sharp curvature, a prototype module achieves an outdoor power conversion efficiency of 15.4% and the daily generated electricity yield improves to a maximum of 190% relative to a non-concentration stretchable PV module,” the scientists said.
The 4.10 mm × 4.95 mm triple-junction cells are encapsulated by the stretchable silicone lens, and the module has the same structure as those of light-emitting diode (LED) packages.
“The ratio of the total cell area to the active power-generation area of the module (32 mm × 40 mm) was 31.7%, and the ratio of the active cell area to the active module area was 28.3%,” the academics said.
They claim that the lens-encapsulating design has the advantage of reducing the number of lens-air interfaces penetrated by sunlight, which results in a lower Fresnel loss at the interfaces between dissimilar materials. The so-called Fresnel loss is an optical power loss caused by a refractive-index difference across propagation media interfaces encountered by an electromagnetic wave.
The prototype was processed with a stretchable conductive paste and was screen-printed on the TPU sheet. It formed an electrode pattern and the cells were placed on this electrode pattern through die-bonding and wire-bonding. Injection molding was used to form the lens on the device.
Outdoor testing showed that the module could fit perfectly on spherical surfaces with a curvature radius of 100 mm, and under outdoor one-sun irradiation. According to the researchers, the stretchable panel could be placed on car roofs (without gaps), motorcycle helmets, airfoil-shaped surfaces, and even concave surfaces.
The scientists described the device in the paper “Stretchable micro-scale concentrator photovoltaic module with 15.4% efficiency for three-dimensional curved surfaces,” which was recently published in Communications Materials. The research team included scientists from Japan's Nagaoka University of Technology and Toyota Motor, which recently assessed the potential to use solar cells based on gallium arsenide (GaAs) and other III-V materials in passenger cars that are partially powered by PV.

India added 7 GW of renewables capacity in the first eight months of fiscal 2020-21 (to the end of November). Installations are down 38% year on year from the 11.4 GW installed in the same period last year, according to a new report by Care Ratings. 
Solar power accounted for 5.2 GW of the new capacity additions, or 75% of the total. That took India’s cumulative installed PV capacity to 37 GW as of late November. 
“The lower capacity additions [in fiscal 2020-21] can be attributed to the lockdown-led disruptions in the supply chain (which slowed movement of inputs and has led to an increase in their prices), labor shortages, as well as the constrained finances and liquidity pressures faced by the developers. Besides, the restriction on the imports of inputs, viz, for solar power, has aggravated the constraints faced by the developers,” said Care Ratings analysts in the report. 
Coal-based power, which is the nation’s dominant electricity source and accounts for 55% of the total power generation capacity, added just 1.9 GW to generation capacity in the eight months to November 2020.

The Australian Smart Energy Council and Germany's energy agency, Deutsche Energie-Agentur (Dena), announced a partnership on Tuesday that will see them cooperate to ensure that customers are able to buy certifiably green hydrogen, rather than variants made from fossil fuels. The national, industry-led Zero Carbon Certification Scheme will include the creation of a ‘guarantee of origin,’ allowing the production of the hydrogen, ammonia and other renewable hydrogen-based fuels and materials to be tracked and authenticated.
The scheme will likely mirror the CertifHy scheme currently being developed in Europe, and will prove important as Australia gears up to become an exporter of renewable hydrogen-based fuels.
“Australia will be a major producer of renewable hydrogen, renewable ammonia and renewable metals and Germany will be a major consumer of these products. It makes absolute sense for Australia’s Smart Energy Council to directly partner with the German Energy Agency to help build these industries and develop a credible certification scheme,” said Smart Energy Council Chief Executive John Grimes.
The Smart Energy Council will work with Dena through its Hydrogen Australia division. As part of the partnership, the bodies will also work together on initiatives to support new green hydrogen developments and identify barriers, ultimately driving trade between Australia and Germany across the hydrogen supply chain.
The scheme will also cooperate with international partner network the Global Alliance Powerfuels, which is also headed by Dena, to foster the development of carbon neutral power fuels.
Andreas Kuhlmann, CEO of Dena and spokesman for Global Alliance Powerfuels, welcomed the partnership.
“International partnerships are key to tackling climate change and the attainment of our joint energy objectives,” Kuhlmann said.
