But it is difficult to tell whether the Balkan country will seize the “untouched” development opportunity due to its heavy reliance on coal, he said.
“There is potential for renewable energy to eclipse coal – but this is if the government implements certain policies,” he said.
Sher, whose research areas include renewable energy and nanotechnologies, came to this conclusion after two years of investigating the region's renewable energy sector, now culminated in a recently published, co-authored paper.
The paper – titled “Prospects of renewable energy potentials and development in Bosnia and Herzegovina” and published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews – is a composite image of the country’s renewable energy industries. It explores hydropower, of which there are 76 plants, as well as wind, solar, geothermal and bioenergy. The paper also states that the country's current energy makeup: coal and lignite industries produce well over half (60%) of the nation's energy, followed by hydropower (35%) and wind (2%).
Bosnia and Herzegovina only recorded 107 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of last year, according to the most recent data published by the International Renewable Energy Association (IRENA). But Sher said he believes Bosnia and Herzegovina is primed for more solar, as it has “strong” potential due to its climate. Herzegovina in particular is optimal for solar as it records 2,400 hours of annual sunlight.
“The south side has huge solar capacity,” he said. “Most of the year there it is sunny even in the wintertime.”
According to the paper, the amount of radiation is roughly 1,500 kWh/m2 per year, which is “very significant” for PV.
In September IRENA published its own assessment on Bosnia and Herzegovina's “renewable readiness.” The report found that despite the country's energy security and independence, it is weighed down by “air pollution and health impacts” from combustion of fossil fuels and wood.
The report also recognizes Bosnia and Herzegovina’s “underdeveloped” PV potential. A reason for this underutilization could be the “high” initial development cost for large-scale solar, Sher said. It could also boil down to Bosnia and Herzegovina not being a member of the European Union (EU). “Because it is not in the EU, that's why there are no strict laws to follow up with emission targets,” he added.
Bosnia and Herzegovina applied for EU membership in 2016, and as of December last year, it was officially designated a candidate country. This year the EU Commission updated Bosnia and Herzigovina's status, however, and said it needed to “apply further efforts” to fulfill key priorities set out in the EU's 2017 Opinion. According to the Opinion, “significant effort” regarding environment and climate change, among other priorities, needed addressing.
IRENA’s report found that if Bosnia and Herzegovina complied with EU legislation – underpinned by the major target of 42.5% of renewable energy generation by 2030 – as a member state there would be “drastic changes” in its energy sector. This would include the removal of power sector subsidies, adoption of cost-reflective prices and carbon prices, and environmental conservation requirements.
According to Sher's study, Bosnia and Herzegovina has only established half of the EU legislative reforms about renewable energy. Sher said that although Bosnia and Herzegovina has a wedded relationship to coal, it could be “phased out” in the next 50 years if the country explored renewable energy more efficiently.
Signs that this is already taking place include the number of wind farms – two completed with another four planned – slated to produce a total of 936.17 GWh once operational, he said. The presence of 390 planned hydropower plants and another 35 under construction – producing a total of 9,000 GWh – as well as 182 solar power plants is another promising indication.
He came to these conclusions, and the other findings in the paper “Prospects of renewable energy potentials and development in Bosnia and Herzegovina – A review,” published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, after two years of research. Research-gathering included translating Bosnian books – a “challenging” task, he said – and collecting scattered data from different meteorological departments and organizations, such as IRENA, to create a composite image. He said he expects domestic and foreign policy-makers to use the paper to better understand the country's renewable energy sector.

Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners, an Australian-owned renewable energy investor and developer, has signed off on a global framework agreement with China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), as it looks to take advantage of the rapidly growing demand for mega-scale renewable energy supply projects that are teamed with large-scale energy storage solutions.
The two parties said the long-term partnership aims to optimize the energy storage solutions available to Quinbrook across its large-scale renewables infrastructure projects, especially those in Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom – a portfolio that currently exceeds 50 GW.
This includes the Sun Cable solar and battery project being developed in Australia's Northern Territory by Quinbrook and consortium partner Grok Ventures.
Quinbrook said it plans to explore the viability of using CATL’s eight-hour and 16-hour discharge energy storage solutions for the Sun Cable project, which is expected to include up to 20 GW of solar and up to 42 GWh of battery storage.
Brian Restall, Quinbrook’s managing director for Australia and the co-chair of the company’s global procurement committee, said the supply agreement builds on an already established partnership with CATL, which includes the deployment of CATL battery systems at its Gemini solar and storage project in the United States.
“Quinbrook has a long history of working closely with CATL,” he said. “We are impressed by the quality of CATL’s technology … their robust product supply chains and the company’s commitment to investing in research and development. We look forward to continuing our working partnership and assessing the viability of CATL’s ultra long-duration storage solutions as well.”
CATL will initially supply Quinbrook with its EnerC Plus containerized liquid-cooling battery systems, with the two companies revealing they are already assessing more than 1 GWh of projects in Australia and the United Kingdom.
CATL, which produced 37% of the world’s electric vehicle batteries and 43.4% of energy storage batteries in 2022, is already involved in multiple battery energy storage projects in Australia, including supplying the battery units for AGL’s 250 MW/250 MWh energy storage system at South Australia’s Torrens Island.
It has also secured the contracts to deliver the battery units for the 500 MW/2,000 MWh big battery in Collie, Western Australia, and the 200 MW/800 MWh extension to the nearby Kwinana battery.

California-based PVEL, an independent test lab for the downstream solar industry, said this week that it has made several upgrades and expansions to its extended reliability and performance tests for solar modules. 
The test lab expanded its Product Qualification Program (PQP), which has been offering accelerated testing services since 2012. The PQP provides empirical data for PV module benchmarking and project-level energy yield and financial modules to identify top performing PV modules. 
The PQP testing helps inform the company’s annual PV Module Reliability Scorecard, which provides actionable insights for solar module procurement. 
“The improvements we’ve made in this PQP update incorporate critical feedback from our downstream partners, research institutes, module and component manufacturers, and our own test results, keeping the PVEL PQP at the forefront of the growing demand for PV module procurement due diligence,” said Tristan Erion-Lorico, vice president of sales and marketing at PVEL. 
The changes to the PQP include: 
Participation in PVEL’s PQP is voluntary for manufacturers and only top-performing module model types are named in the annual PVEL Scorecard. To date, PVEL has tested over 600 balance-of-materials from more than 70 manufacturers for the PV Module PQP.
“The module buying landscape has changed dramatically in recent years with advancements in module technology and new players entering the market, and in response, PVEL has focused our globally-acclaimed test program on addressing these changes,” said Erion-Lorico.
Erion-Lorico was a recent panelist on the pv magazine Roundtables US 2023 event. The session, which focused on emergent trends in solar cells and module production and adoption, can be viewed in full below.

There’s something curious going on with PV market data. In July 2023, Rystad Energy first pointed out a gap in our understanding of module inventory in Europe but the numbers were arguably overestimated. So what’s going on? Before we dive into the data let’s introduce some nuance and recognize that the global PV sector is still experiencing growing pains, not least when it comes to accessible, reliable market intel.
For many years, the PV export numbers from China to Europe, and the installation numbers from government agencies and commercial market research organizations, revealed a large gap in our knowledge. For example, in 2022 around 86 GW of modules were imported into Europe. However, only 42 GW was installed in the same year. What explains this gap?
Some of it can be accounted for by the difference between European Union installations and those in non-EU countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Switzerland, Norway, and the United Kingdom. Looking at the numbers, though, this accounts for less than 10% of the gap between the supply to the European Union and the reported installation figures. More of the gap can be explained by a combination of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) modules and the stock that is being held in a growing market, as German PV industry veteran and pv magazine founder Karl-Heinz Remmers has argued in his online market commentary.
According to Remmers, normal inventory levels would comprise two to three months worth of solar module supply. For 2022, that would have been equivalent to around 8 GW, maybe more in a growing market but not much.
The reality is that distributors have already scaled up inventory tremendously, especially following the logistical chaos caused by the Suez Canal obstruction of 2021 and the commencement of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. There’s been a scramble for warehousing, including from manufacturers holding stock, often in harbors. So, the big question is: Where is all the excess stock alluded to by Rystad?
The short answer is that it doesn’t exist. Insiders know very well that the gap between primarily Chinese import and the official numbers is most likely explained by the fact that PV installation registration is lacking.
For example, let’s look at the Netherlands. Say the estimate for this market in 2022 is 4 GW of installed PV capacity. That number was first published at the beginning of 2023 as a temporary figure by government agency Statistics Netherlands. However, a revised number is usually published by the agency 18 months later, often with new data correcting the initially published figure.

That is the process in the Netherlands, a densely populated country with a sophisticated bureaucracy. If even in the Netherlands not all installations are registered, imagine what the situation is in many other countries.
The real figure for installed capacity is higher than official numbers suggest. Yet most commercial market-research organizations still rely heavily on official numbers, just like national solar trade associations. Therefore, the gap between import and official numbers, whether by government or commercial market-research agencies, is partly explained by EU27 and non-EU27 reporting, OEM imports, and growing stock in a growing market, but the predominant factor is non-registered systems.
In 2022, data from Dutch customs showed Rotterdam harbor was responsible for 45% of European PV imports. That equated to a total import value of €11.6 billion ($12.3 billion), up from €5.1 billion a year before (see chart). For the first half of 2023, the total import value was €6.1 billion. That was less than in the second half of 2022 but higher than in the first half of 2022.
The PV industry needs to step up. With solar singled out as the leading climate change solution, alongside wind energy, and a paper published in the Oct. 17 edition of “Nature Communications” concluding that we may have already passed the tipping point where solar energy comes to dominate global electricity markets, more collaboration is required to maximize the PV sector’s potential.
A great step would be for all manufacturers and distributors to share their data, monthly, with an independent researcher or research organization. This is done in many other sectors and gives all parties great insights into market share and trends and forecasts, lowering risk for the market as a whole.

The device is intended for applications as a top cell in perovskite-silicon tandem solar devices, where the upper cells must have a high energy bandgap to achieve output current matching. These top cells, however, suffer from a higher bandgap-voltage offset, due to non-radiative recombination and energetic misalignment between the perovskite and charge-selective layers.
In order to solve this issue, the researchers utilized a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) based on carbazole, which acts as an effective hole-selective layer (HSL). These SAMs were previously utilized in experimental solar cells and are commonly developed through a molecular glue added during processing in order to dramatically improve adhesion between the light-absorbing perovskite layer and the electron transport layer.
“The SAM typically consists of an anchoring group, a spacer, and a terminal group,” the scientists explained, noting that their monolayer is also based on phosphonic acid (Ph-2PACz) and two benzene rings to create an extended conjugated system. “Carbazole-based SAM-HSLs have emerged due to their respectable stability and energy level alignment with perovskites, and they are ‘electron rich,' favoring hole selectivity.”
The top perovskite cell was made with an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, the SAM, a perovskite absorber, a buckminsterfullerene (C60) electron transport layer, a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a copper (Cu) metal contact. It achieved a power conversion efficiency of 21.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.26 V, a short-circuit density of 20.5 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 82.6%.
“The bandgap-voltage offset at 0.41 V is one of the lowest for any 1.67 eV perovskite solar cells with a record efficiency,” the academics said.
The scientists decided then to use the top cell in a 1.03 cm2 monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell, and they found that the latter achieved a power conversion efficiency of 28.9% and an open-circuit voltage of 1.91 V. Some reference cells used based on other types of monolayers achieved efficiencies ranging from 25% to 26%.
“The Ph-2PACz-based tandem device showed enhanced damp-heat durability, producing negligible performance losses after 280 h of damp heat,” the group stated. “Notably, the encapsulated Ph-2PACz- based tandem device retained 98.8% of its initial efficiency after 200 thermal cycles, passing the IEC 61215 photovoltaic module standard.”
All the details about the cell technology can be found in the study “Molecular engineering of hole-selective layer for high band gap perovskites for highly efficient and stable perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells,” published in Joule. The research team was formed by scientists from the University of Sidney, German research center Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, the Southern University of Science and Technology in China, the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia, and the University of Ljubljana of Slovenia.

Analysis by NREL shows that solar energy systems, when paired with 14-day long duration energy storage (LDES), can outperform military-grade emergency diesel generators (EDGs) in both survivability and financial viability for military applications.
Historical statistics comparing the failure rates of EDGs to solar plus LDES technologies demonstrate that, over a 14-day standard military uptime evaluation, solar plus LDES’ survivability probability exceeds 95%, while the diesel generators’ survivability hovers around 80%.

The study also suggests that a more strategically sized solar-plus-storage system could achieve nearly perfect reliability, with uptime approaching 100% over a two-week period. NREL differentiates between the 95%+ ‘Intermediate’ battery energy storage system (BESS), which is currently available for field testing and provides a 38% round-trip efficiency, while the 100% ‘Goal’ BESS, still in the conceptual phase, is expected to provide a 48% round-trip efficiency and cut the energy storage system costs in half. However, since the ‘Goal’ BESS is currently under development, future costs may deviate from these projections.
The analysis also found that the Intermediate solar-plus-storage projects had a positive net present value, meaning that they paid for themselves over the long term. The same could not be said for the EDGs. The theoretical Goal BESS sized projects with 100% uptime over the 14-day window were projected to have a net present value positive over their lifetimes.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/09/maximizing-photovoltaic-system-performance-insights-on-partial-shading-and-power-electronics/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 9, 2023",Maximizing photovoltaic system performance: Insights on partial shading and power electronics,"Harnessing the power of the sun, PV systems are transforming the way we generate electricity. However, while the sun's energy is abundant, harnessing it effectively in all conditions remains a challenge. One of the significant hurdles that PV systems face is the issue of partial shading.
Max Performance Under Partial Shading
PV generators mounted on rooftops often encounter varying degrees of shade. The complexity of this challenge lies not in the presence of shade itself, but in understanding how to navigate it. Surprisingly, the solution isn't necessarily about introducing more sophisticated power electronics to the system. In fact, for most rooftop systems, this isn't the path to peak performance (see Fig. 1). The effectiveness of power electronics hinges on various factors, such as the degree of shading, the number of PV modules in a single string, and the overall size of the installation.
As owners and PV planners seek answers to this intricate problem, they can find insights from conference presentations and the upcoming technical report from IEA-PVPS Task 13, available on the IEA-PVPS website. These resources shed light on a topic that has puzzled experts for decades.
These three wiring variants are common in solar power roofs today, although the use of MLPE components, like DC/DC optimizer has increased in the last decade.

                                                              Fig. 1: Cyril Allenspach / ZHAW Master Thesis 2023, Switzerland
The Evolution of PV Technology
Over half a century ago, the introduction of bypass diodes in PV modules was a game-changer. These diodes acted as conduits to redirect current flow in cases of partial shading with remarkable efficiency.
Yet, the journey of PV technology has been marked by constant evolution. New DC/DC converters have taken the reins, offering the potential to operate each PV module at higher voltage values with lower module currents. This innovation outshines the simple serial connection of all modules to power the conventional string DC/AC inverter.
However, it's essential to note that this isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. The situation where DC/DC optimizers shine is relatively rare, typically occurring when a single solar cell in the module is shaded by no more than 40%, and three bypass diodes are used. While the theoretical potential for energy gain with DC/DC optimizers is promising, it must contend with real-world losses, which typically account for about 2% of the annual yield, significantly higher than traditional PV module serial connectors.
Understanding Data Sheet Values
In the current market, customers are presented with offers for DC/DC optimizer PV systems for their single-family homes. These offers often flaunt impressive data sheet efficiency values, with claims of 99.5% efficiency and average efficiency values of 90%. Based on these figures, local PV experts may recommend these systems as the most efficient choice. However, there's a nuance in these numbers that often escapes casual observation.
Today's datasheet values are a rare sighting and are typically found in cases where the optimizer operates in a specific mode known as k = 1. This mode is where the optimizer functions as an ohmic resistance rather than a DC/DC voltage converter. This specific mode, depicted on the left side of Figure 2, represents a unique scenario that doesn't reflect the daily reality of most PV systems. Nevertheless, over 100 million of these optimizers have been installed worldwide, predominantly on small-scale rooftops.

Fig. 2: Static efficiency of Huawei 450W P measured at ZHAW IEFE (see C. Allenspach, F. Baumgartner, EUPVSEC 2023)
However, there's a catch in interpreting these impressive efficiency values. In the past, DC/DC manufacturers often advertised double-digit percentage yields, which, unfortunately, customers sometimes misinterpreted as the system's annual yield rather than performance in specific shading moments. This discrepancy underscores the importance of not merely relying on impressive figures but diving deeper into the practical implications of these systems.
Challenges in PV Planning
One of the challenges in the world of PV planning is the reliance on typical commercial PV planning tools that tend to overestimate the capabilities of DC/DC components. These tools often rely on the above data sheet values as an average for all optimizers within the system. However, they may not adequately consider the complex shading situations of each cell in the module, the role of all bypass diodes, or the orientation of the module on the roof.
These tools used by PV planners typically estimate the average module power output relative to the percentage of the shaded module area. While this provides a basic overview, it doesn't account for the intricacies of partial shading scenarios. The result is often an inaccurate reflection of real-world performance.
Popular Findings
The complexity of addressing partial shading has led to in-depth research and findings that offer valuable insights. The Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW; German: Zürcher Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften) annual simulation results, based on shading analyses of each individual solar cell, paint a clear picture. These models are built on the losses of commercial DC/DC optimizers measured indoors at relevant operating points. The losses observed are approximately 2% lower than the manufacturers' data sheet information, a significant variance that has been documented in various conferences, papers, and magazines.
The outcomes under different shading conditions are enlightening and offer practical guidance:
In scenarios with little to no shading or light shading conditions, such as a single chimney casting a slight shadow, the conventional string inverter typically performs equally as well or even more efficiently. This is achieved through the serial connection of standard PV modules equipped with three bypass diodes using SINV.
When light shading intensifies slightly, as with the presence of another small exhaust pipe next to a chimney or a dormer shading the PV modules, local optimizers used occasionally (e.g., 1-4) can deliver optimal yield. These independent optimizers outperform systems that incorporate losses from optimizers that either don't supply power to shaded modules or do so only sporadically. The advantages extend to shading-tolerant modules equipped with more than three bypass diodes, making them the preferable choice when a group of PV modules faces shading.
Fig. 3 Annual performance of several power electronic systems (see Fig. 1) and PV module types for shading of the PV roof generator, between category light to medium shading, by a chimney using commercial DC/DC optimizer
(See F. Baumgartner, C. Allenspach, EUPVSEC 2023, Lisbon and C. Allenspach, F. Baumgartner et. al. Sol. RRL 2022, 2200596)
In instances of substantial shading, such as a dormer casting shadows on some modules and additional shading from neighboring buildings, installing an optimizer behind each module can substantially increase the annual yield. This approach is particularly beneficial when compared to unshaded conditions, where the annual yield may decrease by up to 10% or more.
The market currently lacks highly efficient low DC voltage string inverters that can utilize approximately four to ten PV modules in a single string. However, this gap is addressed by DC/DC optimizers that can accommodate various module orientations within small strings. Additionally, the introduction of new half-cell butterfly PV modules, with all half cells connected in series at higher PV module voltages, offers a promising solution.
In summary, shading-tolerant modules can potentially yield up to a 2% increase in annual yield combined with the use of SINV, while the use of Module Level Power Electronics (MLPE) optimizers results in a more modest 1% increase without shading-tolerant modules. However, it's important to note that the absence of a PV module situated behind a chimney leads to the Single Inverter (SINV) either being more efficient or equally efficient, as detailed in the EUPVSEC 2023 paper (see Fig. 3).
Optimizing PV Plant Design
The design of an optimum PV plant hinges on the selection of one of the three PV power electronic systems. Whether to opt for standard PV modules or shading-tolerant PV modules is a decision with long-term implications. In the years to come, a wider range of the latest PV module products, along with new low-voltage PV inverters and multiple Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) inputs, will become available. These developments aim to facilitate the creation of long-term, robust systems that are both efficient and environmentally friendly.
Cost Considerations and Future Insights
PV inverters typically require replacement once during the 25 years of PV plant operation. However, the scenario becomes more complex when it comes to DC/DC optimizers. Operating at significantly higher temperatures on the roof, these electronics may face more frequent replacement needs. In Switzerland, a country with a robust market for single-family houses, it's common to budget for replacement costs ranging from about 1000 to 3000 Swiss Francs. These costs often include fall protection measures, further underlining the financial aspect of optimizing PV systems.
The Need for Informed Decision-Making
In a fair market, end customers must gain a clear understanding of the various options available for their PV rooftop system. Choices range from string inverters and independent optimizers to all optimizers and the use of individual shading-tolerant modules. It's not just about assessing potential electrical performance gains; it's also crucial to consider the associated risks of possible replacement costs. With these factors in mind, customers can make informed decisions that align with their long-term goals and budgetary constraints.
Collaborative Efforts for Improved PV Planning
The exchange of factual information among different stakeholders in the PV industry is a catalyst for progress. The development of improved commercial PV planning tools and an enhanced experience for PV system planners are the results of this collaboration. IEA PVPS Task 13 is at the forefront of these efforts, with plans to publish a final report in 2024. This report will include recommendations from international experts, coordinated by ZHAW, aiming to guide the industry toward more effective and efficient PV system planning. The report will be available at Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – IEA-PVPS

“We used particularly challenging sites as case studies, which suffer from a complex surrounding landscape, high latitude, and heavy cloud cover,” the scientists explained. “Ground-based measurements provided the most accurate measure of the albedo of the sites, but are impractical to implement, requiring at least one year to reproduce seasonal trends.”
The method combines data from two satellite sources – Sentinel-2 and NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). Their combination reportedly helps to compensate for each other’s shortcomings. The MODIS observations are supplied at a surface spatial resolution of 500 m and, therefore, cannot be used to predict albedo in smaller areas, as they will catch data from neighboring fields. “For most installations less than 20 MW, the site will be too small compared to MODIS pixel resolution,” the academics explained.
Sentinel-2, by contrast, supplies higher spatial resolution images with 20 m × 20 m. However, MODIS provides data with higher quality. “We combined the high spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 with the better time resolution and angular reflectance information available at lower spatial resolution from MODIS,” the scientists said.
The group compared the results it achieved with the new approach with those of another albedo estimation technique based on MODIS with typical landscape datasets.
The results of this method were compared to another estimation method based on MODIS with a typical landscape dataset. “When the spatial resolution of MODIS is insufficient to accurately image the target site, a potential alternative studied in this work is to use a different ‘typical landscape’ as a reference,” the paper explained. “The typical landscape should have the same ground type and seasonal behavior as the target site. For this study, we generated a ‘typical’ temperate grassy bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameter dataset sourcing data from MODIS satellite observations of 5 different sites.”
Both methods were then compared through on-the-ground field examination. The site for the satellite-based and ground collection was a field in an undisclosed UK location, with regular mowing of the grass but no tilling or sowing. The site was also mostly cloudy or overcast more than 50% of the time, with the sky being completely clear only about 15% of the time.
“These features combined present an almost worst-case scenario for estimating effective albedo using remote sensing,” the research team explained. “The complex landscape presents issues for imaging with moderate resolution satellites, such as MODIS, while the high cloud cover limits the number of days on which good observations are possible.”
The academics said their method has a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of around 10%, while the reference method approached 40%.
They presented their findings in the study “Sourcing albedo data for bifacial PV systems in complex landscapes,” published in Solar Energy. “At this stage, we caution against generalizing the method to any location until further validation is performed with additional sites that represent a larger variety of conditions,” they concluded.

German silver metallization paste maker Heraeus has acquired an unspecified stake in French PV module manufacturer HoloSolis.
In 2025, HoloSolis plans to open a PV cell and panel factory in Hambach, France. At full capacity from 2027, the factory is expected to employ 1,700 people and produce 10 million modules per year, for a total capacity of 5 GW per year.
“Heraeus, with its cutting-edge metallization technologies, is a very valuable asset for our global leadership,” said HoloSolis President Jan Jacob Boom-Wichers.
In fiscal 2022, Heraeus achieved sales of €29.1 billion ($31.1 billion) with around 17,200 employees in 40 countries.
“Heraeus will also play an active role within the board of directors, providing its advice, experience and expertise,” said Christian Neumann, a tech specialist for Heraeus.
Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy (ISE) recently said that it will support HoloSolis in setting up its planned manufacturing facility.
Three European entities – EIT Innoenergy, French IDEC Group, and TSE – founded HoloSolis. EIT Innoenergy is an EU-financed clean-tech investor based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. IDEC Group is a real estate developer in France, while TSE is a key producer of solar energy in France and a leader in agrivoltaics.
HoloSolis stands as a flagship initiative under the European Solar PV Industry Alliance (ESIA), which aims to establish 30 GW of annual European production capacity by 2025.

The system is designed for hydrogen production.
“Material costs of about $1,000 are needed per gram of hydrogen,” researcher Hyun S. Ahn told pv magazine. “My coauthors and I are confidently aiming for a hundred-fold improvement in the cost efficiency in scale up, targeting to about tens of dollars of material cost per gram of hydrogen produced.”
Scientists used Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a single-cell green algae capable of generating photoelectrons, for the system. To overcome the barrier of cell walls that photoelectrons cannot cross, they integrated the algae with carbon nanofibers (CNFs). These CNFs serve as conduits, guiding the photoelectrons from the cell into a buffer solution.
They exposed the engineered alga-CNF to solar irradiation and observed an average photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 0.7%, peaking at 0.9%. At this efficiency level, a single alga-CNF cell can produce up to 9.5 W.
“Such power rating can be translated to approximately a milk-carton-sized batch capable of powering a laptop at reasonable cell densities,” the research group stated. “The cellular power stations exhibit a unique advantage that the algae swim and efficiently pack in three dimensions rather than cover a flat surface; therefore, space requirements for energy generation are less stringent than that of planar solar-to-fuel devices.”
The group used the process for the generation of hydrogen by adding platinum (Pt) to the composite, due to its lower cathodic redox potential. Redox, or reduction-oxidation, is a chemical reaction that involves the transfer of electrons between two substances. Due to the differences in redox potential in the composite, a synthesis of metal nanoparticles at the end of the inserted CNF is possible, acting as fuel-forming catalysts. This process uses the generated photoelectrons as a reductant, as they contribute electrons to the Pt surface.
That created two reactions in the solution: a hydrogen evolution and an oxygen reduction. According to the researchers, leaving this process to evolve gradually, hydrogen production accelerated from day six. Peak production was recorded on day 10 and maintained to day 50 for a total of 363 μmol of hydrogen in a 15 mL batch. The fuel production rate scaled linearly with the volume of the batch.
“The photoelectron relay chain in the developed algal cell power stations was highly efficient,” the researchers said. “Continuous photosynthetic hydrogen evolution in excess of 50 days is one of the longest lasting systems. The rate at which our cellular power stations accrued hydrogen was among the fastest reported.”
In addition, the academics found the algal cell's bioelectrogenic reactors to self-regulate the oxygen level. That results in hydrogen fuel that is available for direct feed into a commercial fuel cell without the need for separation or purification. To demonstrate it, they fed the fuel into a radio-controlled (RC) car.
“Smooth running of the vehicle comparable to that powered by pure hydrogen was observed. This is an unusual case of driving a mobility device by synthetic green hydrogen at the laboratory scale,” they said in “Prolonged hydrogen production by engineered green algae photovoltaic power stations,” which was recently published in Nature Communications. “Solar-to-fuel conversion consuming only CO2 and water as the electron source is a champion achievement. We believe the photovoltaic power station developed here will play a pivotal role in the design of renewable energy portfolio in the future due to the demonstrated scalability along with cost and space efficiency of energy production.”
Ahn said that “the scale-up of the system is rather simple, thanks to the good growth rate of the algae even in high concentrations. Scale-up simply would require increasing the volume of the reactor and the algal cell power station concentration. At industrial optimization, we think that bath-tub-sized reactors should be able to power full-sized fuel cell cars, needing 2 kg to 4 kg of hydrogen per week of driving.”

Compared to the end of March, projects and planned capacity surged by 41% and 46%, respectively.
Since December, the Polish authorities have awarded grid-connection permits for 6.6 GW of PV projects, with 1.2 GW of the total also obtaining construction permits.
“In total, in the period from December 2022 to November 2023, construction permits were issued for PV projects with a total capacity of over 2.5 GW,” said the IEO.
The country’s transmission system operators have rejected many project applications, despite the growth in new projects and capacity. For instance, Enea has dismissed 380 projects with a combined capacity of 6.28 GW over the last two quarters, while Energa has turned down 109 applications, with a total capacity of 312 MW.
Poland's cumulative installed PV capacity hit 12.4 GW at the end of 2022, according to data from the IEO. Its installed solar capacity could more than double to 26,791 MW by the end of 2025. IEO's latest report suggests that this year, the nation will add approximately 5,981 MW, followed by 4,392 MW in 2024 and 3,996 MW in 2025.

The French startup was created to make it easier for homeowners to acquire solar PV systems. One way it does that is via its website, which is designed to enable consumers to enter their own data about location, site specifications, and energy needs to receive a customized offer with estimated costs, including information about return on investment.
Ensol claims to be able to commission a new project within one month of receiving a signed offer. Its website lists suppliers, such as French module-maker DualSun, along with inverter and communications gateway suppliers, such as US-based Enphase, Israel-based SolarEdge and China-based Huawei.
Demand for its business is driven not only by a need to make purchasing solar PV systems more efficient for French households, but also rising consumer electricity prices in France, along with the country's high potential of residential PV, according to Paul de Preville, co-founder, Ensol.
“France is the only country in the European Union not to have achieved its energy mix targets. We wanted to completely reinvent the experience. Our mission is to simplify and accelerate access to solar energy for French households, thanks to our technology, our transparency, our fair prices and our integrated energy equipment ecosystem,”  de Preville told pv magazine.
The November issue of pv magazine, out today, is dominated by the issue of global oversupply and examines the effects of a solar glut in the European Union, the United States, and other markets. We turn the spotlight on PV developments in South Korea, Taiwan, and Africa and update readers on technological progress in thin films, kerfless wafering, and mass produced heterojunction PV.
The company will use the capital to offer home energy solutions, such as battery storage, heat pumps, and electric vehicle wall chargers, and set up virtual power plants (VPP) via its customers’ installed PV capacity.
“Our vision for the future is to offer all our customers the possibility of adding value to their electricity production on the grid by grouping all these decentralized solar mini-power plants on our VPP platform,” said de Preville.
