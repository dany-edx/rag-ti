Axpo Italia CEO Simone Demarchi today hailed his company's agreement to buy an estimated 22 GWh per year of clean electricity from Canadian Solar as a turning point for Italy.
Quoted in a press release issued by Sino-Canadian solar manufacturer and project developer Canadian Solar, Demarchi said: “Agreements such as long-term PPAs [power purchase agreements] finally allow the market and all the actors involved to definitively exit the incentive logic … The hope is that this trend, which is already well established in Europe, will soon achieve stability in Italy as well.”
Canadian said it had secured Axpo's signature on a ten-year power purchase agreement related to two solar plants planned in Sicily which will have a combined generation capacity of 12 MWp. Construction of the facilities, near Ragusa and Enna, will start this year, said the Ontario-headquartered developer.
The PPA was signed as part of a wider framework deal between the two parties, announced in November, for up to 300 MWp of Italian solar.
Announcing the Sicilian power offtake agreement, Canadian Solar chairman and CEO Shawn Qu said his company has a solar pipeline “in excess of 1.3 GWp” in Italy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/24/global-solar-supply-chain-under-scrutiny/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",MICHAEL FUHS,"MAY 24, 2021",Global solar supply chain under scrutiny,"From the roof terrace of the reception building, there's a good view of the Phase 4a factory on the right-hand side. “It is the latest one”, says  Kevin He, who works in investor relations at silicon producer Daqo New Energy. On the left hand of the video shows is what is supposed to become Daqo's Phase 4b factory. The former facility consists to a large extent of pipes, tubes, vessels and whatever one imagines heavy industry to be. At the new factory site, only cranes can be seen. The Phase 4b fab is still just a construction site and is expected to be fully ramped up by the end of the year, explains Kevin He. Last week, the company invited analysts for a tour of the site and released a 90-minute video of the visit.
The video is instructive for anyone who wants to learn about modern silicon production and does not have the opportunity to visit such a factory themselves. The elephant in the room, however, is not mentioned by Kevin He or anyone else in the video: the allegations that forced labor is used in the Chinese region of Xinjiang. Indeed, the Financial Times described the tour as a “charm offensive”
Image: screenshot, Daqo video
Daqo CEO Longgen Zhang, however, did comment on the matter in a press release on the visit: “As stated repeatedly, we do not condone the use of forced labor under any circumstances.”
In the video, the camera, accompanied by soft background music, moves through empty stairwells into a control room equipped with an impressive wall of screens. The group enters a bus that drives across the site and then walks into factory floor with the furnaces. Green floor, white walls, lots of pipes and technology – employees are notable in their absence.
“Our visitors were able to see that our chemical process, which is highly automated, digitalized, technology-intensive, is not conducive to employing unskilled labor,” Longgen Zhang explains in the press release.
Obviously, it is not possible to prove that forced labor does not exist with a company tour and therefore it is no surprise that the discussion continues on various sides.
A few days after the factory visit, the Helena Kennedy Centre at the Sheffield Hallam University in the United Kingdom published a report containing what is probably the most detailed collection of links to official documents related to many of the well-known solar-grade silicon and polysilicon manufacturers based in Xinjiang.
The report’s authors claim that the information proves the clear links between the solar companies located in Xinjiang and forced labor programs. The researchers’ main argument is that the regional government has attracted many polysilicon manufacturers by granting a series of fiscal and economic incentives since 2015. Manufacturers that invest in the region have little opportunity to avoid the local government programs known as “surplus labor” and “labor transfer” involving the Uyghur and Kazakh indigenous minorities, the report claims. These programs, it adds, include forced labor practices.
“After 2016, by which time the camp system had begun to emerge, companies that ‘absorbed surplus laborers’ to work in their facilities received significant incentives, including subsidies for the cost of building new factories, transport of the products made there to the coast, training for the new labor recruits (including Chinese language training), transport of new workers, and salaries of workers,” the researchers say. They speak of a pervasive impact of Xinjiang labor transfers on the entire solar supply chain.
Concerning Daqo, however, the Sheffield publication only concludes from the IPO prospectus that it “may indicate that the company employs state-sponsored labor transfers in its own facilities, as “placement” is a term the central government and Xinjiang regional and local governments sometimes use for labor transfers.” Also this is, obviously, no smoking gun.
The allegations of forced labor in the Chinese solar industry became a major issue in the Netherlands when Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Sigrid Kaad discussed the matter on May 18, answering questions submitted in Parliament in April by members of the center-right Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the Labour Party (PvdA) and the green GroenLinks party.
Kaad cited a report by US-based Horizon Advisory, often used as a source to support the allegations, but said the government thus far did not have sufficient evidence to verify the validity of the information provided by the study.
The minister did not exclude the possibility that subsidies could have been given to solar projects relying on PV panels whose production could have stemmed from a supply chain that may have involved Uyghur forced labor. Kaad stated that the current requirements of the Netherlands’ subsidy programs for solar and renewable energy did not require companies to investigate or certify the entire supply chain of a product.
“I will also raise the issue during the Foreign Affairs Council (Trade) of 20 May 2021,” Kaad said, adding that she had also discussed the matter with French Minister Delegate for Foreign Trade and Economic Attractiveness Franck Riestener and European Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders.
In Germany the law is clearly evolving in the direction of making companies more accountable for their supply chain. A week earlier, the scientific service of the German Bundestag, which is supposed to provide MPs with independent information, had already published a 128-page paper on the legal implications of the situation in Xingjiang for German companies. Although it finds “no explicit indications of a physical-biological intention to destroy,” it does see “an intention of social destruction” with respect to the Uyghur population.
This is particularly explosive in Germany in view of the fact that the Bundestag is about to vote on a supply chain law under which companies could face fines if they violate their “human rights due diligence obligations”. If they cannot counter “human rights risks within their supply chain” in any other way, they may have to end business relations with particular suppliers. Even criminal liability of company employees cannot be ruled out, the paper states.
In this respect, the end of the discussion is likely to be a long way off and the impact on the photovoltaic supply chain very difficult to assess at present. Just the existence of risk that human rights are being violated is relevant to companies when administering their supply chain, even if there is no evidence of human rights violations by an individual supplier.
It is therefore no surprise, as the Financial Times reports, that Daqo executives plan to request an independent third-party audit.

Amid fears African governments are planning to strangle a vigorous market for independent commercial and industrial clean power generation in a bid to protect financially-stricken state-owned power utilities, Dan Marks, of African Energy Live Data, said political leaders “must ask themselves whether the economy is there to serve utilities, with companies prevented from procuring the cheapest or most reliable power and growing their businesses, or whether utilities are there to serve the economy.”
African Energy Live Data, part of Middle East and Africa-facing consultancy Cross-border Information, was highlighting the lack of net new electricity generation capacity added in Africa last year, with the 9.6 GW installed in 2019 falling to 7.7 GW in a Covid-hit 12 months.
The May edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
Whilst the data company, which is based in Hastings, England, acknowledged the project development problems caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, it pointed to the fact the 2019 figure had also been a steep fall, from the record 19 GW of new power capacity installed in 2018. It is that, longer-term pattern which prompted the analyst to suggest politicians are struggling with the demands caused by the energy transition – and by the rise of private power developers – on state-owned electric companies.
The effects on the solar industry were particularly stark in North Africa, where African Energy MD John Hamilton reported 3.1 GW of new gas generation capacity – of the 3.2 GW of gas added across the continent in 2020 – helped the region account for 4.3 GW of the 7.7 GW of projects installed across all of Africa. Hamilton cited “awkward regulatory and political blockages” as halting an energy transition which had seen 500 MW of solar projects added in 2018, before the following year's 1.4 GW peak.
The analyst said gas dominated the new generation capacity added in 2020, ahead of hydropower, which added a net 911 MW across the sub-Saharan Africa region from which African Energy Live Data removes special case South Africa. Solar was the third largest contributor to the new power mix, with 842 MW of new projects added last year, placing it ahead of wind capacity, which rose 829 MW.
Removing PV front-runner South Africa from the sub-Saharan equation saw the region add just 100 MW of new solar capacity, the same level as coal and wind and less than half the 207 MW of new liquid fossil fuel generation capacity, according to the data company.
Noting encouraging renewables progress in Togo, Burkina Faso, Mali, Chad, Mauritania and Senegal, however, the analyst said the proportion of renewables in the power mix rose across all of Africa except the north; the proportion of non-hydro renewables was almost as impressive, with just the north and east regions failing to rise; and the growth rate of non-hydro clean power capacity accelerated in West, central and southern Africa.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/24/estonian-companies-working-on-a-green-hydrogen-value-chain-in-5-to-10-years/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,ESTONIA,LATVIA",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"MAY 24, 2021",Estonian companies working on a green hydrogen value chain in 5 to 10 years,"Estonia outperformed its 2020 renewable commitments and Estonian energy company Alexela expects the success story to continue: On the back of the PV growth, the country may achieve the GHG reduction goals this year that the EU has set for 2030.
This achievement won’t automatically translate into green hydrogen production, however.
“Estonia, like all other EU countries, is still far from reaching the level of intermittent power generation where we could see enough hours of low or negative electricity prices to facilitate hydrogen as an alternative for large-scale storage,” Marti Hääl, executive vice president of Alexela, told pv magazine. “For example, the Nord Pool day-ahead electricity price was below €10/MWh in 2020 only for 1,122 hours. It is not enough to make large-scale hydrogen electrolysis plant Capex feasible.”
“We believe that in 5 to 10 years this situation will change, and the volatility of power market prices will increase, including PV, where we already see three-digit growth rates per annum.”
According to Hääl, PV is growing primarily on “valuable agricultural landscapes. I believe that, in our region, PV should be more suited for prosumers, both residential and industrial, and offshore wind could be the core of large-scale renewable electricity.”
Together with PowerUp Energy Technologies, Alexela recently launched a first end-user hydrogen application. Green hydrogen production is the next step.
“Existing industrial production is all based on methane reforming. Some pilot electrolyzers are already up and running. But in terms of the future, we are currently working on a consortium of Estonian companies to start a green hydrogen value chain from production to consumer,” said Hääl.
PowerUp Energy Technologies, which produces hydrogen fuel cell-based electric generators and proton exchange membrane fuel cells, pays close attention to the maritime, electric car, and refining sectors.
“With sulfur content regulations becoming more stringent, usage of green hydrogen in the refining sector has increased tremendously,” Dr. Ivar Kruusenberg, founder and CEO at PowerUP Energy Technologies, told pv magazine. “In the same way, metal refineries are one of the main users of hydrogen. Most of the electrolyzers used to produce hydrogen are sold to metallurgy companies.”
The startup teamed up with Alexela for the launch of the first end-user application in the country. It is also collaborating with one of the region’s most advanced mobility companies, Nobe, and other multinational companies. The final aim is to create a cluster for greater accessibility of hydrogen in the Baltic region. French and German companies are interested in the market.
“Presently, we are collaborating with gas giants like Messer group and Linde, and we have plans to team up with Air Liquide in the near future,” Kruusenberg explained. “So essentially, we work with hydrogen providers and try to integrate the system by making hydrogen available for our customers.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/24/greece-deployed-913-mw-of-pv-in-2020/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"MAY 24, 2021",Greece developed 1 GW of solar in 2020 and has linked Crete to the mainland grid,"Solar association the Hellenic Association of Photovoltaic Companies (Helapco) has published figures which show Greece completed 913 MW of new solar generation capacity last year.
The vast majority of the new projects consisted of solar arrays with a generation capacity of up to 500 kW but a sizable number of larger solar farms were also commissioned after being awarded contracts in national renewable energy tenders.
Until January, projects no larger than 500 kW were supported by feed-in tariffs (FITs) but such arrays now also have to compete in renewables tenders.
The prospect of that remuneration policy change drove a rush of applications for relatively small solar farms last year, as developers sought to secure fixed FIT payments rather than the premium tariffs paid to facilities tendered in the national procurement rounds, which are linked to the wholesale electricity price.
Despite the FITs rush for sub-500 kW solar projects, of the 913 MW of new PV added last year, only 459 MW were connected to the grid, according to Helapco. The remaining installations will be electrified this year.
The solar industry body’s Stelios Psomas explained the reasons for the shortfall. Under Greek law, Psomas told pv magazine, a PV project was previously awarded its FIT when connected to the grid. However, the national electricity distribution network operator was unable to process the rush of applications in a timely manner last year, and many installed projects faced the danger of not being able to secure a fixed tariff before the switch to top-up premium payments.
That risk was averted when the Greek government passed a law enabling solar developers to fill in a ‘readiness for connection’ declaration qualifying them for a feed-in tariff even if their facilities were not hooked up until this year. The declarations, rather than the grid connection date, now trigger the award of FITs. Psomas added, the distribution operator will check a random sample of readiness-for-connection declarations and will apply hefty penalties to any projects which have filed an incorrect installation date.
The near-1 GW of solar installed in 2020 returns the Greek solar market to the boom conditions seen just short of a decade ago.
The nation's underwhelming net-metering regime, however, continued to disappoint last year, with Helapco reporting only 17 MW of net-metered systems were added, to take the total to 51 MW since the regulation was introduced in 2015.
Attempts have been made to improve the volume of net-metered solar installed but without any noticeable effect.
Nevertheless, Greece had installed 3.74 GW of photovoltaic capacity by the end of 2020, of which 3.28 GW is connected to the grid.
Meanwhile, the government has announced Crete, Greece’s biggest island, has been connected to the mainland electricity network.
A 174km subsea link, described as the world’s longest subsea AC cable, has been completed, said Greece's Ministry of the Environment and Energy on Thursday.
The new interconnection has a 2×200 mega volt amp (MVA) transport capacity and will undergo testing in the weeks ahead, said the ministry, before it goes into commercial operation. 
The €397 million project was financed by domestic and European Union funds and also received loans from EU lender the European Investment Bank. 
The interconnector will meet a third of Crete's electricity demand. A second, larger interconnector is also being built between Crete and the mainland and upon completion, in 2023, it is expected to save Greek electricity bill payers around €400 million per year from the savings made from reducing reliance on subsidized diesel generators.
Greece is trying to link its largest islands to the mainland grid while deploying mini-grids on smaller isles, such as Tilos.
New interconnections, including with neighboring countries, are necessary for Greece to transition to a greener energy system.  
Domestic interconnections, such as the subsea link between Crete and the Peloponnese, will help the nation develop renewables plants in its sunniest and windiest regions and transport the electricity generated to where it is needed. International interconnections will improve Greek energy security and boost the competitiveness of its energy market.
The country's power utility has recently announced plans to bring forward the national exit from coal, from 2028 to 2025. The remaining lignite plants will either be shuttered or converted to gas-fired facilities.
Having greenlit the faster exit from coal, the government is preparing energy storage regulation and planning new power interconnections.
A new electricity link between Greece and Bulgaria is under development and may be operational by 2023 and Greece also recently signed an agreement with Cyprus and Israel to work towards connecting their grids.
This copy was updated on 24/05/21 to include extra information.
This copy was updated on 17/02/22 to specify an estimated €400 million annual saving for electricity bill payers will happen only after Crete is fully connected to the mainland grid.

According to the country’s National energy and climate plan (NECP), solar PV will expand from 1,362 MW currently to 5,054 MW by 2030. The country needs to install a total 6 GW of new wind power and solar PV capacities over the next 10 years.
“Currently, there is no support scheme for new-build projects, but Romania is working towards implementing a new mechanism,” Monica Cojocaru, partner at Schoenherr Romania, told pv magazine. “We have noticed growing interest in renewable energy in the market and among our clients in recent months.”
George Niculescu, state secretary at the Ministry of Energy, said that the contract for difference (CfD) mechanism should come into force in no more than two years.
“The Ministry aims for an accelerated schedule which would make the new support scheme possible in 16 to 18 months,” he said during an event organized last week by Schoenherr Romania, adding that the financing guidelines to access the EU Modernisation Fund could be ready by December.
The Employers' Organization of Renewable Energy Producers in Romania (Patres) is advocating for extensive reforms of the local energy markets and a bigger role of prosumers.
“Romania has a very high electricity balancing cost, one of the highest in Europe. The country needs to review its policy measures to foster investments,” Patres Vice President Martin Moise told pv magazine, noting that the country was facing an energy crisis at the moment, with an increasing reliance on imports.
Issues for PV installations are also related to recent changes in legislation for agricultural land. “Things got more complicated than they used to be during Romania's first wave of renewable investments,” Simona Chirică, partner at Schoenherr Romania, commented. “Besides the legal matters that are usually analyzed when securing the land needed for developing renewable energy projects (which are quite numerous), a series of matters set forth by more recent legislative changes also need to be carefully considered, such as the new agriculture land sale procedure introduced last year, or the need to obtain a soil quality certificate.”
Schoenherr launched its annual publication “Renew Romania” last week, underscored the immediate steps country needed to take: transposing RED II, clearing the way for PPAs, stepping up the introduction of the CfD support mechanism, adopting the new electricity law and the offshore wind law, while easing access to EU funding.
Romania reached its 2020 targets ahead of time thanks to the support scheme implemented from 2008 to 2011. According to the report, the positive result “encouraged” the Romanian government’s passivity, as Bucharest concentrated on containing the effects of the support scheme on energy bills.
Romania’s current electricity production comes mostly from hydropower (34%), coal (21%) and wind (15%).

GCL said on Friday, it had discovered this month it holds 865 million fewer shares in its New Energy project business than it previously thought, with the discrepancy dating back to June.
The development hinges on a dispute related to a US$60 million loan taken out by GCL business Elite Time Global Ltd on August 28, 2019. Elite Time secured the loan, from an unnamed third party, by pledging shares in the GCL New Energy business worth twice the value of the borrowings expected. The lender, GCL said on Friday, confirmed in a loan agreement on September 26, 2019 that it would supply three payments of US$16 million followed by a final tranche of US$12 million.
GCL said it transferred 865 million of the 11.9 billion shares it held in GCL New Energy to a depository broker in line with the loan agreement. The solar company, however, said it only ever saw US$2.2 million of the promised amount, which it says was handed over in February last year. In May last year, GCL said it received a letter from the lender claiming the terms of the agreement had been breached.
“The company does not accept the notice of default is justified,” said GCL-Poly on Friday, in a note to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange which continued: “and despite communications with the lender regarding the outstanding amount of the loan to be funded by the lender, and potential alternative arrangements with respect to the loan, no additional funds were advanced by, nor new terms agreed with, the lender.”
GCL said it contacted the unnamed depository broker which was in custody of the pledged GCL New Energy shares this month only to be told the stock had been transferred to the lender “on or around 6 June 2020” after the financer had submitted an entitlement order. GCL said it received no notice of the development when it reportedly occurred, in June, and has since “received an email from an entity claiming to be the successor entity of the lender,” confirming the stock had been forfeited.
The Chinese polysilicon maker said it is considering legal remedies in relation to the stock and that it “is of the view that it continues to control the operations of GNE [GCL New Energy] even if ownership of the pledged shares has been purportedly forfeited.” However, the company was forced to reveal that, as a result of the development, it holds only 49.24% of GCL New Energy's shares at the moment.
Trading in the company's stock has been suspended since the end of March because GCL has been unable to publish its 2020 accounts because of the contractor payment issue which prompted previous auditor Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to resign. The auditor and its client were unable to agree the scope of a planned investigation into a RMB510 million (US$79.3 million) pre-payment made by the company, also in September 2019, for a silicon project which was never constructed.
The heavily-indebted poly manufacturer and solar project developer failed to settle a US$500 million senior note at the end of January, retroactively triggering a cross default of other liabilities from the end of 2020. Plans to reissue the senior notes in question are progressing through the court system of Bermuda, where the company is registered for tax reasons.

Lux Optimeyes Energy is investing some €5 million in a new factory in the southern Portuguese city of Moura that will manufacture flexible photovoltaic solar panels and lithium batteries.
The factory will occupy the facilities of the old Moura Solar Factory (MFS), owned by Acciona and ProJinko, which was active for 10 years before shutting down production in September 2018 and closing permanently in January 2019, leaving 105 people unemployed.
The group of investors behind the Lux Optimeyes Energy consortium and the municipality, located in the region of Alentejo region in the country's Beja district, last week signed the lease for the former MFS fab and a memorandum of understanding for the execution of the project. Portugal's Minister of Environment and Climate Action João Pedro Matos Fernandes and the Undersecretary of State and Energy João Galamba attended official start of the project.
Lux Optimeyes Energy is owned by Portuguese tourism sector group Lux, led by Rui Torrão and Paulo Torrão, and energy industry veteran Miguel Matias, former director of innovation at Galp Energia and founder of London-based Self Energy Group as well as fellow UK company Optimeyes Energy.
The total investment is estimated at about €5 million, of which €2.96 million were provided by the local government through the Alentejo 2020 regional funding program.
The new factory, which is expected to begin operation by the end of the year, will create more than 40 direct jobs in Moura, most of them for former MSF employees, and another 200 indirect jobs in the promotion, sale, development and installation of the solutions to be manufactured.

Whilst global reserves of the metal are not expected to come under the extreme pressures expected of other raw materials, the IEA's The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions document has pointed out plans to diversify copper mining with projects in Peru, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Mongolia will do little to dent China's domination of the next stage of the copper supply chain: processing the element.
Solar power generation requires twice as much copper as coal-fired electricity, according to the study, mainly because of the electricity transmission properties exhibited by the metal, especially in subterranean and subsea power lines, where it is preferred to the aluminum widely deployed in overhead lines. The IEA report stated the sheer volume of solar generation capacity expected by 2040 would drive soaring demand for new electricity grid infrastructure. The copper content of power lines – plus the fact the metal makes up around 1% of the content of a standard silicon solar panel and around 40% of a rooftop PV system, thanks to its use in string inverters – means the 350 kilotons (kt) of copper used worldwide last year is likely to hit 990kt by 2040. That estimate is based on the IEA's sustainable development scenario; under its more conservative, business-as-usual forecast, copper demand in 2040 would still rise to 800kt, thanks to solar.
The May edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big insight into the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT, co-location for green hydrogen production, price trends amid the polysilicon shortage, and the factors informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
The report examined three alternative scenarios regarding solar which included wider adoption of cadmium-telluride (CdTe), thin-film PV; perovskite-silicon tandem technology; and gallium-arsenide (GaAs) panels. A return to favor of thin-film panels would drive tellurium demand up to 1.4kt in 2040, up from global demand of 500 tons today, as well as supporting a 1.3kt cadmium market, carving a slice out of the current 23kt annual supply. Wider adoption of ultra-efficient GaAs solar tech would require 3.5kt of gallium in 2040, more than ten times the current annual market for the sufficiently high-grade version of the mineral, as well as around a quarter of today's arsenic production – 8kt. If the commercialization of perovskite-and-silicon tandem devices was accelerated to carve out a slice of global solar, it may not have as dramatic an effect on critical materials supply but it would raise demand for lead, noted the IEA.
In terms of the current mainstream solar tech – and it's grid expansion needs – around 30% of the today's copper is extracted in Chile, with Peru, China and the DRC the other biggest suppliers, stated the IEA. Of that global supply, some 30% is carved up between five entities: Chilean state-owned Codelco, Anglo-Australian miner BHP and Anglo-Swiss rival Glencore, Arizona-based Freeport McMoRan and Mexican-owned Southern Copper Corp. Codelco has the largest slice of the pie, according to the IEA, with an 8% global share.
Investment in copper production has been steadily rising since 2010 – albeit with a Covid-related retreat from $18 billion in 2019 to $12 billion last year – and there are plans to diversify production with new deposits in the DRC, Indonesia and the U.S. However, the IEA noted, more investment in production will be needed to meet expected demand as copper mines have an average lead-in time of around 17 years from discovery of deposits to output.
The widespread prevalence of the copper mining industry, and related price stability and maturity of trading markets is counterbalanced by the fact the quality of copper ore at the world's most established deposits is declining rapidly as the most easily accessible sources are exhausted, with the problem compounded by water stress in the world's chief sources of the element.
Even if production expands sufficiently to meet demand, the IEA said, nothing currently being planned will reduce the world's dependence on Chinese operations to refine the ore into processed material.
The Paris-based energy body made six recommendations in its 287-page study into how to ensure sufficient energy transition minerals remain available to enable carbon emission reduction targets to be met around the globe.
Policy support will crucial to drive new supply and technological innovation will help in substituting more commonplace materials for the minerals such as the cobalt and lithium needed for the EV transition and energy storage, and the nickel, zirconium and platinum-group metals required for hydrogen electrolyzers and fuel cells. Tech breakthroughs could also enable the extraction of vital minerals from other sources, such as electronic waste and mining by-products, added the IEA.
Wider, better recycling will be vital to shore up supplies, said the report, and nations could take actions to make their supply chains more resilient, including by stockpiling in some cases, although the IEA pointed out that would not be as effective for minerals with looser supply constraints, such as copper.

While the IEA's case for tighter environmental, social and corporate governance standards across the board will be welcomed in many quarters, it is hard to understand the economic necessity of such a move, despite claims by the report that such regulation will be essential to keeping the energy transition in operation. Concerns over the damage opening up new mineral deposits could cause are well founded, particularly in a study which touches upon the potential of seabed exploitation, but could complicate the final suggestion made by the report, that international co-operation will be central to secure a sufficient supply of clean energy resources.

Rooftop solar adoption has not gathered the desired momentum in India despite the government push. Major reasons are policy conundrums, ill-designed institutional and governance structures, distorted market mechanisms, and technical challenges such as those involving grid connectivity, according to a new report by Asian Development Bank.
India achieved 4.4 GW of installed rooftop solar capacity by December 2019, which is just 12% of the 40 GW by 2022 target. Out of the total rooftop solar installations in the country, the residential sector has been the worst performer, at 16%, compared to other competing sectors such as industrial and commercial.
The report cites persistent policy-level inconsistencies as a primary cause of the slowdown. Poor and piecemeal implementation of net metering policies at the sub-national scale is a major roadblock for the uptake of rooftop solar in India. Most of the state regulations on net metering set the maximum capacity limit at 1 MW per metering point for rooftop solar systems to be connected to the distribution grid, which hinders large-scale deployment. Often this capacity ceiling is imposed based on the poor financial health of the distribution utilities. These arbitrary caps impede the uptake of rooftop PV.
The report stated that while rooftop solar systems require bottom-up approaches focusing on intense consumer engagement, the current policy and regulatory regime is designed based on a top-down approach with a uniform set of policies and regulations that lack flexibility. The most recent evidence of such policy-level obstruction is the withdrawal of net metering policies in certain states for commercial and industrial consumers. There is no adequate understanding of how the existing intervention types perform in varying policy, regulatory, and governance environments.
Apart from regulatory constraints, there are also societal and informational constraints. Poor understanding of the rooftop solar benefits among users is a major challenge. This is compounded by the high upfront capital cost to deploy the systems, particularly for residential consumers.
In one study surveying five Indian cities, close to 50% of respondents were found to be unaware of rooftop solar technology and its applicability in the household context.
In addition to the general information asymmetry, there is a substantial lack of knowledge about the specific products, processes, and approval systems inherent with these systems. Lack of credible and objective sources of information has led to consumers relying on vendors for information.
This lack of information is further compounded by the high upfront capital cost to deploy these systems, as these are often not within reach of the larger section of the society. Although there has been a dramatic reduction in the rooftop solar system cost in recent years, the initial cost continues to be a major hurdle even for small projects.
Further, banks and financial institutions are reluctant to lend funding for these projects due to their small scale. Traditionally, banks charge a high interest rate to developers (10%–12%, or up to 14%) depending upon the associated risks, nature of the project, and the borrower’s credit rating.
Lack of technical capacity often acts as a barrier to scaling up these interventions, particularly in rural settings. The needed market eco-system has not been created, and the much-needed supply chain has not yet been established.
The report stated policy makers need to modify the net metering policies and their obstructive provisions. The removal of capacity constraints would be attractive not only to existing consumers but also to new consumers.
Even if it is not possible to have uniform policies across states, policies could be formulated considering state-level nuances characterized by factors such as unmet Renewable Purchase Obligations and the strength of distribution utilities, it added.
A structured approach could go a long way in arresting some of the challenges currently encountered. The best way to minimize the regulatory burdens and procedural complexities is to institutionalize a single-window facility for the entire eco-system of rooftop PV deployment, encompassing connectivity, net metering, electricity inspection, and limitations on sanctioned load.

Malta Inc. and Duke Energy, using a Department of Energy grant, are partnering on a one-year study to assess the socio-economic, environmental, and operational issues behind converting retiring coal units into long-duration, zero-emissions energy storage systems.
The two companies will look at integrating Malta’s 100 MW, 10-hour pumped heat energy storage system into existing infrastructure at a Duke Energy coal plant in North Carolina.
Malta’s system stores electricity either directly from a power plant or from the grid. It does this by converting electricity into thermal energy (heat and cold). The heat is stored in molten salt, a proven method of storing thermal energy, and the cold is stored in an antifreeze-like solution with components and subsystems derived from the liquefied natural gas industry.
In practice, the system operates like a conventional power plant. When electricity is needed, the thermal energy powers a heat engine to energy. Because the system leverages well-understood concepts in a novel energy storage application, the companies said they are confident in safe and resilient operations, while hoping for an approach that eventually can become a viable commercial storage solution.
Malta said that its system can be configured to store up to 200 hours of energy; the study will focus on the energy industry’s current need for 10-12 hours of storage.
The Department of Energy announced the grant in March, and the team is currently identifying which of Duke Energy’s six coal plants in North Carolina is best suited to serve as the test site. Once a site is finalized and the study is complete, the team will deliver a list of findings, including an engineering conceptual study, a technology maturation plan, and a socio-economic report on potential benefits.

As installations of distributed residential rooftop systems continue to rise in Australia, network service providers and regulatory bodies such as the Australian Energy Market Commission are grappling to manage energy flows and the stability of the grid, while trying to devise rules of grid engagement  that demonstrate fair treatment of prosumers who have invested in PV… A new study by UNSW hopes to inform their decision making with data that provides visibility over how inverter standards are already affecting rooftop solar generation, and how householders feel about curtailment of returns on their clean-energy investment.
“I’m excited to be able to give evidence-based, data-driven research to industry and regulatory bodies,” Dr Baran Yildiz, Senior Research Associate at SPREE, and Collaboration on Energy and Environmental Markets (CEEM), tells pv magazine Australia, “so that they can make the most appropriate decisions for energy users and aggregators.”
The $100,000 combined technical and social study, Curtailment and network voltage analysis study (CANVAS), is funded by the Commonwealth Government RACE for 2030 Cooperative Research Centre (where RACE stands for Reliable, Affordable Clean Energy) and also aims to enable policies that support further integration of renewables into the energy system at scale.
The proposal for the project refers to the many “opportunities and benefits” that distributed energy resources (DER) offer consumers, but states: “There remains a limited evidence base regarding the severity of DER curtailment in Australia, and its potential role in assisting network voltage management.”
UNSW’s School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering (SPREE) has negotiated access to anonymized data sets of rooftop solar generation from participants in AGL’s South Australian virtual power plant (where battery inverters manage interaction with the grid), and from Solar Analytics’ system-performance monitoring platform (from the South Australian customer base using solar PV inverters to interact with the grid). The dual datasets will allow a first-time comparison of curtailment as managed by battery inverters and solar inverters.
It is one of the biggest DER data sets available for research purposes in Australia, says Yildiz. The high-resolution data from AGL alone takes up tens of gigabytes of processing capacity, and the initial fast-track, six-month project phase would not be possible without a computing-power grant from Microsoft Azure’s AI for Good program.
Various state and federal bodies in Australia have for years made changing demands of inverters sold in Australia, in relation to how they respond to irregularities of voltage detected in the grid — meaning they may have been required to reduce or switch off the output of small-scale solar systems to the network when thresholds are about to be breached.
In South Australia, where more than 35% of households have solar on top, the State Government and network service provider (NSP), SA Power Networks, in 2020 enforced a rule that requires every new household connecting solar to the grid to have an inverter capable of being switched off entirely by an external agent in the event of pending grid imbalance caused by peak solar production and related very low energy demand — say, when midday solar output on spring weekends is peaking but it’s not hot enough for everyone to switch on the air con.
Most of these inverter responses, however, occur automatically (SA’s big turn-off capability has so far only been invoked once since it was introduced on 28 September, 2020), and it’s difficult to know which customers are using inverters of which vintage, conforming to which standard. There is no oversight — for consumers, NSPs or market operators — of how much solar energy is being jettisoned.
“Users may notice that in the middle of the day, when their solar should be generating at full capacity, that it’s off, or it’s not performing as expected,” says Yildiz.
That doesn’t mean they’re being curtailed, he adds, explaining the opacity of current data. There could be several reasons, related to either solar panel or inverter functioning, why a system is operating below par.
The CANVAS team, which also includes Naomi Stringer, Shanil Samarakoon, Dr Anna Bruce and Assoc. Professor Iain McGill,  is correlating its findings of irregularities in expected solar output with information on conditions in the network at that time, provided by the Australian Energy Market Operator, thereby firmly pegging it to voltage disturbances.
It has just finished top-line, fast-track analysis of the AGL data and is now casting a net through Solar Analytics’ offering.
“Every site is being analyzed separately,” says Yildiz, “then we quantify what percentage of sites are losing, and to what level,” and — this is where it gets even more interesting — “what they may lose if inverters were abiding by different rules and settings for each site.”
This scenario modeling will help guide regulator decisions and will be accompanied by social research already underway, which is testing the palatability of different scenarios with householders who have invested in solar.
Yildiz expects the survey of energy prosumers, led by his colleague Sophie Adams, a human geographer at UNSW who is investigating the social license to automate, to yield a rich variety of insights, but was able to share a preliminary finding with pv magazine.
One question asked of focus groups in the CANVAS study is how they would respond if they found out they weren’t getting the expected return on their investment — either as solar energy for their own use, or as solar exported to the grid for a feed-in tariff.
Yildiz said prosumers indicate they would be tolerant of actions taken during infrequent emergencies, where the burden of curtailment was equally borne by people across an affected region. However, if the events were frequent, or if some people were disproportionately affected, or if their returns were severely impacted, they would be discouraged from investing further in solar systems, and from recommending a solar investment to friends.
The fast-track stage of analysis is due to be completed in July, with insights to be shared across the industry, and specifically to regulatory bodies, such as the Australian Energy Market Commission, which recently published a widely criticized draft decision to require householders and small business to pay an annual fee — a ballpark $100 — to export their excess solar energy to the grid.
The next stage of CANVAS will continue to add new emerging data to the study as it also deepens its analysis.
“Australia leads the world in rooftop solar installations, said RACE’s Chief Research Officer, Dr Chris Dunstan in a statement, “It is crucial that we remove barriers to growing this clean and low-cost resource. We are delighted to see this project underway.”

Two-dimensional thin films used in perovskite solar cells that hold promise for commercialisation have been found to have a structure more like two layers of bread with filling in between than the previously assumed “gradient” structure of a cracker with topping.
Findings of new research led by the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science in collaboration with scientists at Australia’s CSIRO, and Shandong University herald the potential for greater efficiency of perovskite solar cells, and have just been published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry C.
The newly discovered 2D  structure — of small-n Ruddlesden Popper perovskites (RPPs) sandwiched between layers of large-n (RPPs) — encourages excitons, the quasiparticles instrumental in converting sunlight to electricity, to move from the central layer to the surfaces of the film. At the same time free carriers transport the resulting charge for collection by electrodes, such that when the perovskite film is incorporated into solar cells they facilitate more efficient solar generation.
“There’s been quite a lot of controversy in the literature” published on the structure of thin-film perovskites, says Professor Ken Ghiggino, one of the authors of the new paper. He adds, “The advance that we’ve achieved is to find out what the real structure of these films is and how they work in a solar cell.”
The ARC researchers based at the University of Melbourne used scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), time-resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption measurements to identify the revised understanding of the thin-film materials.
Two-dimensional perovskite films are a leading contender to form the next generation of solar PV technology and are valued for their stability and durability compared to 3D perovskite cells, their potential low cost, and their likely contribution to the development of light-weight, flexible solar panels. But as recently as February this year, researchers were remarking that they showed “limited charge transport” and a “large bandgap” for solar applications.
“This is the first time a sandwich structure had been proposed versus the conventional gradient distribution model,” says the University of Melbourne’s Dr Fei Zheng, lead author on the new paper. “We think this discovery will help design and device optimisation for higher performance of the 2D cells and LEDs.”
Prototype 2D devices have so far demonstrated 13% efficiency. Researchers can now attempt to drive up that efficiency by changing the thickness of the layers within the ‘sandwich’.
In line with the remit of ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science — which is to discover and develop new materials that improve solar technology, lighting and security systems — 2D perovskite films also have potential application in light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors used in video imaging, security systems, biomedical imaging, gas sensing and optical communications.

A new tool from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Berkeley Lab allows users to explore trends in wholesale electricity prices and their relationship to solar and wind generation.
The Renewables and Wholesale Electricity Prices (ReWEP) tool allows users to compare pricing trends across locations, regions, and a number of different timeframes, down to the nodal level. These comparisons help illustrate the ongoing interactions between solar and wind generation and wholesale energy prices.
The ReWEP tool consists of maps, time series, and other interactive figures that provide a general overview of how average pricing, negative price frequency, and extremely high prices vary over time; and a summary of how pricing patterns are related to solar and wind generation. Interactive functionality allows investigation by transmission regions (ISOs/RTOs), year, and season, and over diurnal cycles.

Berkeley Lab said the tool can reveal some key observations:
The ReWEP tool is intended to provide users a way to explore ongoing changes to pricing patterns, including those related to growth in wind and solar deployment.
