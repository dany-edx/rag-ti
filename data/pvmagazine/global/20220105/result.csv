The company expects to complete 31 energy storage systems in 2021-22, with an accumulated capacity of 1GW.
SMC's battery storage portfolio started to take shape last year when the company revealed it was nearing completion on projects across the country. It announced 31 batteries would be deployed by the end of this year, not only to improve power reliability and help frequency control, but also to make way for the integration of some 3GW of intermittent renewables capacity.
At the time, SMC president Ramon See Ang said his company would build solar plants in combination with battery storage at 10 locations throughout the Philippines. These are scheduled to go online by next year.
While there has been no update since on the progress of those solar-plus-storage facilities, a couple of big batteries owned by SMC have already been connected to the grid. Last year, German and U.S.-owned energy storage joint venture Fluence said it commissioned two 20MW/20MWh batteries out of a 470MW/470MWh energy storage portfolio it was contracted to supply and maintain for SMC Global Power. With project sites ranging in size from 20 to 60 MW, the SMC portfolio procured with Siemens and AES Corp-owned Fluence is spread across 13 sites.
Finnish tech company Wartsila announced commissioning of its first two battery storage projects for SMC Global Power in May. The projects have capacities of 20MW/20MWh and 40MW/40MWh and are part of previously announced energy storage orders for 100MW/100MWh of systems.
According to a stock exchange filing today, the battery storage fleet is intended to augment SMC’s renewable energy portfolio, “which includes the construction of solar, liquefied natural gas, and hydroelectric power plants to address the continuing need of the country for reliable and affordable power.”
While an increasing number of utilities are considering natural gas as a “bridge” to full renewables an unnecessary step, SMC Global Power, one of the Philippines’ largest power generators, appears to hold a different view. It operates the 1.2GW Ilijan Combined-Cycle Power Plant, the country’s largest natural gas facility, and is gearing up to build another 1.3GW plant, in Batangas City. SMC announced, in July, it will drop new coal projects from its expansion plans as it transitions to a low-carbon future.
At the time, the company announced it had scrapped “plans to put up three new clean-coal power plants with a capacity of 1,500MW in favor of new facilities that utilize cleaner, renewable energy sources.”

According to the company, the vehicle is the most efficient electric car it has ever built, thanks to outstanding energy consumption of less than 10kWh per 100km and a range of more than 1,000km.
The car features a newly built in-house system that is claimed to achieve a benchmark efficiency of 95%, from battery to wheels. “The battery pack in the Vision EQXX holds almost 100kWh of energy, yet has 50% less volume and is 30% lighter than the … benchmark pack in [the] EQS,” the manufacturer stated, referring to one of its best known electric vehicles.
Starting from 2024, all the vehicles in the series will be equipped with 117 solar cells placed on the roof.
“It was developed in collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE – Europe's largest solar energy research institute,” Mercedes-Benz said in a statement. “The net result of reducing the energy drain on the high-voltage system is an increase in range. On a single day, and under ideal conditions, this can add up to 25km of range on long-distance journeys.”
The power generated by the solar cells is stored in a lightweight lithium-iron-phosphate battery which supplies a climate blower, the lights, the infotainment system and other ancillaries. “Mercedes-Benz and its partners are working towards using solar power to charge the high-voltage system, too,” the manufacturer further explained.
In a recent interview with pv magazine, Bonna Newman, program manager for PV and mobility module technologies at the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), said that electric cars incorporating PV modules on their bodywork or roof have the potential to reach more than 10,000km per year of pure solar-powered driving and that the modules could have a payback time of just three to four years. According to her, the benefits of vehicle-integrated PV are proportional to the solar radiation levels of a given area, its demand for electric vehicles, and power prices.
*The headline of the article was amended on January 7 to reflect that the solar cells are based on crystalline silicon.

A research team at the Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics IBP, and at the Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology IEE, is in the process of developing a renewable energy module facade.
According to the scientists, the module should not only be able to supply a building with solar power, but also to heat, cool and ventilate its rooms.
The heart of the module is the photovoltaic system, which is combined with a heat pump as a heat and cold generator and a decentralized ventilation device with heat recovery. All the necessary components for the system technology are housed in the facade element, which implies a high degree of prefabrication that is claimed to be minimally invasive.
“We're not renovating the entire building, just the facade,” explained Jan Kaier, project manager and scientist at Fraunhofer IEE. “In the future, the old facade will be replaced by new, industrially prefabricated modules with integrated system technology, which makes it multi-functional and adapts it to the new energy standards.”
The entire heating, cooling and ventilation technology for the office space behind will be integrated into the facade. As the heating and ventilation technology are already integrated, no new pipes have to be laid inside the building. The facade must, however, have a power connection in order to be able to air-condition and ventilate the rooms even when there is no solar power generation.
The module facade is intended primarily for office and administration buildings as well as school buildings that were constructed using the skeleton construction method customary in Germany in the 1950s to the 1970s. Instead of load-bearing walls, reinforced concrete supports held the floor slabs. According to the Fraunhofer researchers, the old facade elements will be removed during renovation and the new, floor-to-ceiling modules will be hung in front of the building structure.
A single technical unit of the module facade is 1.25m wide and 30cm deep and can supply a room of around 24m2. The integrated photovoltaic elements generate electricity and supply the individual system components. At the same time, the heat pump acts as a heat and cold generator which is also responsible for intelligent control of the energy flows. It extracts the heat from the outside air via a fan coil installed in the air gap behind the module element and transfers it to the room behind it as heat, via a fan coil. If it has to be used for cooling, the cycle is reversed, drawing the heat from the indoor air and releasing it to the outdoor air.
An integrated decentralized ventilation technology unit regulates the air exchange and heat recovery. Due to the targeted interconnection of air flaps, only one fan is required, which minimizes power consumption. A ventilation device alternates cyclically between supply and exhaust air operation. Vacuum insulation elements also provide thermal protection.
The joint research project is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economics. The project partners are Implenia Fassadentechnik GmbH, as the designer of the module facade. Lare GmbH Luft- und Kältetechnik develops the heat pump, and LTG AG provides the decentralized ventilation. A demonstrator of the renewable energy module facade is currently being tested on the southern front of the test facility for energetic and indoor climate studies (VERU), including a test room behind it, in Holzkirchen. The first results showed that the interaction works well. Fraunhofer researchers are currently further optimizing individual components. Extensive measurement technology is used in the tests. Among other things, parameters such as air temperature, air humidity and air speed at different heights, as well as illuminance, are determined, which are relevant as parameters for comfort in rooms. The electrical consumption of the individual components of the technical unit of the module facade are recorded, as well as the yields of the photovoltaic element in order to calculate an energy balance.

The committee, chaired by finance minister AHM Mustafa Kamal, gave the green light to Korean companies Daehan Green Energy Co Ltd and Hi Korea Co Ltd – plus local developer Pabna Solar Power Ltd – to construct a 70MW, 182-acre solar field at Pabna, and also gave the nod to a 50MW facility in Mymensingh district.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
The latter project will be developed by French clean energy business Total Eren, Oslo-based Norwegian Renewables Group AS, and Bangladeshi company Urban Services Ltd, on a build, own and operate basis. With the site in the Muktagacha upazila, or borough, of Mymensingh, the developers will have to build a 20km power line to the nearest 132/33 kV grid sub station.
Government approval for the projects clears the way for state body the Bangladesh Power Development Board to sign off 20-year power purchase agreements committing to buy the electricity generated at the two sites.
The government will pay $0.1015/kWh for the electricity to be generated by the projects, adding up to a $215 million, 20-year commitment for the larger, Pabna facility, which will be based in Ishwardi upazila, and $153 million in Mymensingh.
In each case, the tariff was agreed under the Quick Enhancement of Electricity and Energy Supply (Special Provision) Act 2021, with the approval of the prime minister's office.
Bangladesh hosts 777.4MW of renewable energy generation capacity and the government wants to generate 40% of its electricity from renewables by 2041, and all of it by mid century, as a member of the Climate Vulnerable Forum of states affected by climate change.

“Through various tender schemes, at least 3 GW of new renewable energy capacity will be added to the country's electricity mix by 2026,” the executive director of the Romanian Photovoltaic Industry Association (RPIA), Mihai Balan, told pv magazine. “And around 2 GW of this will come from solar plants.”
Balan said the funds to implement the tender scheme will come from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) and the EU Modernisation Fund. The authorities also plan to implement a contracts for difference scheme from 2023, with another 3.5 GW of renewables capacity to be contracted by 2025.
Balan said that there are currently between 20 GW and 30 GW of large-scale renewable energy projects in various stages of development. Several hundred megawatts could go online this year alone, he added.
“Some projects planned to operate under a power purchase agreement are now at an advanced stage of development and construction may start soon,” Balan explained, noting that new rules the government introduced in May 2020 are more favorable for power purchase agreements. “All the modeling that we saw and worked on indicate that the initial 2030 targets for solar will be surpassed and we will probably see this reflected in official documents in 2022-23, when the national energy and climate plan should be updated.”
Balan said Romania's future energy landscape will also be favorable to storage. Around 480 MWh of storage capacity could be deployed by the end of 2025, he claimed.
“Currently, there are plans to have a 2 GW battery industry by the end of 2025,” Balan said. “And solar cell and module manufacturing may also be resumed in our country as a result of the NRRP.”
Large-scale solar projects now under development in Romania include arrays being built for coal power supplier Complexul Energetic Oltenia (CE Oltenia). It plans to build eight PV plants with a combined capacity of 725 MW at several of its coal power facilities. Other PV projects that are now in the works include a 111 MW solar park by OMV Petrom, an energy supplier that is majority-owned by Austria's OMV, as well as a 700 MW solar project that will be spread across the municipalities of Grăniceri and Pilu. In addition, CE Oltenia is developing 310 MW of solar at one of its coal power facilities.
Romania is also supporting rooftop PV deployment via the Casa Verde Fotovoltaice (green PV home) scheme for residential solar installations, under the national net metering regime. According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, Romania had 1.39 GW of solar installed by the end of 2020.

Hydrogen could soon be stored in “nano-chocolates” instead of 700-bar pressure tanks, according to recent research by scientists from Germany's Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) institute. The researchers claim that they have managed to bind hydrogen with the help of palladium and iridium, before releasing it again.
Palladium, a precious metal, is considered suitable for long-term hydrogen storage. The element absorbs hydrogen like a sponge, according to DESY.
“However, until now getting the hydrogen out of the material again has posed a problem,” explains Andres Stierle, the leader of the research team. “That’s why we are trying palladium particles that are only about 1 nanometer across.”
The special structure of the storage medium has driven comparisons with chocolate pralines. The small particles are built up like pralines and embed an iridium core that provides needed stability. On the outside, a layer of palladium surrounds the core. The palladium-iridium “pralines” themselves are only 1.2 nanometers in size and were fixed onto the graphene at intervals of just 2 nanometers.
Using an X-ray light source, the researchers were able to follow how hydrogen molecules bind to the palladium particles and then loosen again. This enabled them to see that the hydrogen only binds to the surface of the palladium, and that it can be easily removed from the palladium by slightly increasing the temperature.
Conventional hydrogen storage methods require the gas to be liquified or kept in pressurized tanks, at up to 700 bar. This means cooling it down to minus 253 C. However, DESY's proposed approach purportedly requires much less energy.
“Next, we want to find out which storage densities we could achieve with the new method,” says Stierle.
However, the researchers will need to change the carbon medium to do this. In order to enlarge the surface on which the palladium nanoparticles can be arranged and to accommodate the particles in “significant quantities,” the researchers are considering carbon sponges.
They recently published their findings in ACS Nano, a journal produced by the American Chemical Society.

The agency revealed it allocated all the 2,203 MW it planned to assign through the procurement exercise, and that the final average price was KRW143.120 per kWh ($0.119.6), which was higher by KRW7 compared to that of the previous tender of the same kind, in which 2,050 MW was allocated.
PV projects ranging in size from 500 kW to 3 MW had the largest share of assigned capacity, by securing around 860 MW, followed by installations with output between 100 and 500 kW, which secured around 400 MW. Another 245 MW was allocated for PV systems with a capacity below 100 kW, and about 700 MW was assigned to solar parks over 3 MW.
The final average price for projects below 100 kW was KRW154.411, and for projects between 100 and 500 kW, KRW139.412. Installations with a capacity between 500 kW and 3 MW reached an average price of KRW141.464, and KRW139.742 was the price for projects over 3 MW.
Overall, 5,393 projects were selected by the agency. The PV system owners will be granted the fixed rate over a 20-year period.
The exercise is the second of the two PV tenders planned for this year. There are currently no domestic content requirements embedded in the tender but, starting from this year, projects relying on solar PV modules with a low carbon footprint are being prioritized.
In the two tenders held in 2020, the KEA allocated 1.2 GW and 1.41 GW while in 2019, it contracted 350 MW and 500 MW. In 2017 and 2018, total allocated capacity was 600 MW in each year. Overall, South Korea‘s authorities should tender 4 GW of solar this year.
The country reached an installed solar power capacity of around 15.6 GW as of the end of December 2020. The newly installed PV capacity for 2020 was around 4.1 GW.
South Korea currently plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/05/novel-design-for-shingled-solar-modules/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SINGAPORE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 5, 2022",Novel design for shingled solar modules,"Researchers at the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) have proposed a new design for shingled solar modules that they claim could make these products less susceptible to shading and hotspots, which remain the main hurdles to overcome for wider commercial adoption of this PV technology.
“Rather than proposing a particular interconnection or module architecture as a one-size-fits-all solution, our work offers a design framework based on minimizing potentially dangerous hotspot temperatures while granting manufacturers the flexibility to play around with different design parameters,” the research's corresponding author, Carlos Clement, told pv magazine. “Ideally, the way this would work is a manufacturer chooses a cell technology, may it be p-type PERC or whichever they choose, and through our model, one would generate a matrix of module parameters such as string length, cell fraction and number of strings, where the hotspot risk for each specific combination is quantified. The analysis can also be performed in the opposite direction, with specific module characteristics constrained first and then suitable cell technologies and characteristics determined afterwards.“
In the paper “Design of shading- and hotspot-resistant shingled modules”, which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics, the SERIS team developed an electrothermal model intended at creating a framework for the design of shingled panels that are resistant to shading and hotspots. “For the purposes of this study, we chose to model and test shingled modules manufactured from pPERC cells that were cut into one-fifth pieces via thermal laser separation for improved mechanical properties,” the scientists specified. “From our previous study, we learned that p-type cells exhibit an illumination-dependent effect on their leakage current as the cell approaches breakdown.”
Through the modeling approach, the researchers initially simulated a shingled module's power and hotspot response to shading. They built mini-modules from 12 shingles that were laminated on 20x20cm glass with the same encapsulant and backsheet used in full-sized modules. These panels were tested under negative voltages and standard irradiation conditions and their cell parameters were extracted.
The model was then validated through experimental data. “The accuracy of this model depends largely on how well our split-cell subcircuit can capture cell behavior at negative voltages approaching breakdown,” they further explained, noting that a simulation was performed on module power responses for different configurations of shingled modules. The electrothermal model developed was found to adequately capture the hotspot and shading response of the panels.
These insights were then used to set up the above-mentioned framework for designing hotspot-resistant shingled modules. This requires, first, understanding, via Monte Carlo simulations (MCS), which input cell characteristics are more suitable in a multivariate system where parameters are varying together. “From the perspective of minimizing power loss, it is advantageous to have cells which have more leakage current,” the academics emphasized. “This can be explained by how larger leakage currents allow the shaded cell to match the current of the other series-connected cells without being pushed further into reverse bias.”
According to the research group, raising the number of strings determines, for the shaded cells, a delay in bypass diode activation and larger reverse voltages, which in turn result in higher maximum temperature measured in the cell itself. This, in their view, makes string length one of the most influential design levers in determining hotspot temperature. With an increasing number of parallel strings per block, the shaded string becomes able to operate at lower currents, and lower hotspot temperature.
“The work outlined here is perfectly compatible with existing manufacturing techniques for shingled modules,” Clement told pv magazine.

This isolated lithium loses connection with the current collector, so it is considered electrochemically inactive or “dead,” but a team of US researchers has discovered that this lithium can be brought back to life, boosting the capacity and lifespan of batteries.
Researchers at the US Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University have shown that isolated lithium is alive and highly responsive to battery operations, due to its dynamic polarization to the electric field in the electrolyte. They have designed an optical cell with a lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxide (NMC) cathode and a lithium anode. They also used an isolated lithium island in between as a test device that allowed them to track what happens inside a battery when in use, in real time.
They discovered that when charging the cell, the island slowly moved toward the cathode. When discharging, it crept in the opposite direction.
“It’s like a very slow worm that inches its head forward and pulls its tail in to move nanometer by nanometer,” said Yi Cui, a professor at Stanford University and SLAC, and an investigator at the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Research. “In this case, it transports by dissolving away on one end and depositing material to the other end. If we can keep the lithium worm moving, it will eventually touch the anode and reestablish the electrical connection.”
Lithium metal accumulates at the negative end of the island and dissolves at the positive end. This continual growth and dissolution causes the back-and-forth movement that the researchers observed. Their next step was to modify the charging protocol in order to move these floating islands far enough to reconnect with the anode.
They discovered that by adding a brief, high-current discharging step right after charging, the battery nudges the island to grow in the direction of the anode. As a result, the researchers demonstrated that they can mobilize and recover the isolated lithium, extending the battery’s lifespan by nearly 30%.
The researchers expect these findings to have broad implications for the design and development of more robust lithium-metal batteries. Their study, “Dynamic spatial progression of isolated lithium during battery operations,” was recently published in Nature.

GAF Energy, a supplier of solar roofing products in North America, has announced the launch of Timberline Solar, which it describes as the world’s first nailable solar shingle.
At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week, the Timberline Solar Energy Shingle is set to receive three awards, including its highest honor, the Best of Innovation award for “Smart Cities.” The product was also named as an Innovation Award honoree in both the “Smart Cities” and “Smart Home” categories. What sets it apart from other solar shingles like Tesla’s, for example, is that the roof system directly integrates solar technology into traditional roofing processes and materials, according to GAF Energy.
The shingles will be assembled domestically at its facility in San Jose, California, which was constructed last year after the company moved manufacturing out of South Korea. At the time, the facility was expected to be able to produce 50 MW of solar panels per year, and provide jobs to about 400 people in manufacturing, engineering and R&D.
In an interview with pv magazine, Martin DeBono, GAF Energy’s president, said that R&D teams will be a short stroll away from the production line. And while California and Silicon Valley are not known for their low costs, the company chose San Jose for its proximity to a talent pool that is used to innovating for companies such as Apple and Google.

GAF Energy says that Timberline Solar shingles are water-shedding, strong and warranted to withstand wind speeds of up to 130 mph. Rack-mounted solar installations require the drilling of dozens of holes into the roof membrane. Any resulting damage related to those holes is not typically covered by roof warranties.
GAF Energy is the sister company of GAF, a leading roofing and waterproofing company. With access to GAF’s national contractor network, GAF Energy is uniquely positioned to bring residential solar to the mass market.
“Solar roofs are the future of clean energy, and Timberline Solar is the game-changing innovation that will get us there,” said Martin DeBono, president of GAF Energy.
The Timberline Solar design has secured UL 7103 certification, which authorizes GAF Energy to install the systems on residential rooftops as a roofing product and a solar energy product, making it the first of its kind to be recognized as both. In addition, GAF Energy has worked with Sandia National Laboratories, a U.S. Department of Energy R&D lab, to verify the strength, durability and overall market-readiness of the product.
