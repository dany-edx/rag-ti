The scientists analyzed the performance of a 370 kW commercial PV system based on polycrystalline modules with a temperature coefficient of –0.43%, mounted with approximately 10-degree tilt, and located in eastern Norway. Generation and environmental data were measured at five-minute intervals over a five-year period between January 2015 and December 2019. The PV system had begun commercial operation in September 2014.
The researchers adopted a year-on-year approach and calculated the modules' degradation rate by comparing their performance with that of the same period a year earlier. Measurement data, however, were missing for a five-month period during 2018, which made data from both 2017 and 2019 less useful. “Because one compares the system performance at the same time of year, the method is robust against seasonality caused by the angle-of-incidence (AOI) and spectrum losses, as well as losses from soiling,” they explained. “The metric for system performance is based on the power performance index (PI), defined as the measured power divided by the expected power.”
The model includes the combined effect of temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet irradiation. Through these measurements, the academics found that the solar modules degraded in the range of 0.1–0.19% per year, which compares to a worldwide degradation rate of 0.5–0.6% per year. “Being able to establish that the degradation rates in the Nordics are lower than typically assumed, will influence the LCOE [levelized cost of energy] and how fast deployment of PV will accelerate in the Nordics and similar climates,” the scientists concluded.

The Intermediate People’s Court in Hefei, China ruled that a tool produced by Chinese company Qinhuangdao Visual Automation Co., Ltd. was in conflict with rights granted under patent CN 101314270 B, held by Bürkle and relating to its “multi-level multi daylight” laminator technology.
According to Bürkle, the court’s decision is not yet final, and Visual Automation has already filed a complaint against it. The German company said, however, that it is confident these proceedings will also be decided in its favor.
The ruling will require Visual Automation to cease manufacturing the multi-level laminators and to cease offering them for sale in China. The company will also be required to destroy all existing products that conflict with the patent, including semi-finished products and the molds used to manufacture infringing products. “The court decision on the patent confirms the leading role of Bürkle,” read a statement from the company. “High production volumes combined with high production efficiency are the core features of Bürkle lamination technology.”
Intellectual property has been a contentious issue for the solar industry in recent years, with several sets of legal proceedings ongoing both in the upstream manufacturing segment, and with the module and inverter end products.
Many European equipment suppliers have struggled to gain market share in China, where the bulk of PV manufacturing is now located, and local producers have been able to offer lower-cost products. This year, however, with manufacturing outside of Asia looking set for a comeback, the situation seems better for European suppliers.

Gujarati company Solex Energy has signed a deal for 1.2 GW of solar module production equipment from China’s Jinchen Machinery as it plans to expand output. 
The 600 MW first phase of the fab will be commissioned by October, according to the manufacturer. A memorandum of understanding signed with Jinchen stipulates the installation of phase two will begin as soon as the initial production capacity goes into operation.
The production line, which is being installed near Surat, will be fully automated and capable of manufacturing panels based on wafers up to 210mm in size and featuring multi-busbar cells and micro-gap technology.
Solex intends to take a ‘backward integration' approach to expanding its production capacity as it will develop a 1 GW solar cell production facility after the module line is completed.
The company is one of India's oldest PV module manufacturers and has had a production plant at Anand, in Gujarat, since 2007. Solex is listed on the National Stock Exchange.

With the Dutch grid company struggling to match a rising tide of solar and wind power generation with customer demand, Tennet in January announced its intent to explore how groupings of smart household appliances could be deployed to even out electricity demand across the grid, thus freeing up network capacity to accommodate more renewables generation.
This month, Tennet announced the start of trial which will see appliances including rooftop PV systems, heat pumps, electric vehicle (EV) chargers, batteries, and night storage heaters bundled into a virtual power plant (VPP) by Munich-based energy internet-of-things business Greencom Networks.
The VPP created by Greencom will be available for Tennet to draw upon to ease grid congestion when required, via the blockchain-based Equigy crowd balancing platform developed by Tennet alongside Italian, Swiss and Austrian peers Terna, Swissgrid and APG, respectively.
As part of the trial, participating households will “benefit economically through the offered flexibility of their installations,” according to a press release published on the Tennet website.
No further details of the payments available were specified and it was not made clear where the participating households will be based, with Tennet also operating in Germany.

DuPont Photovoltaic Solutions, though, has now brought to market a solution which promises an easy fix – a Tedlar-based band-aid for modules.
The materials supplier estimates that, in Europe alone, about 6 GW of solar capacity is affected by backsheet failures. After years of service in humid or dry, hot or cold conditions, and under severe UV-light irradiation, backsheet materials can suffer from defects, with some materials more susceptible than others. If backsheet failure reaches a critical stage, the film begins to crack, exposing the rear of the semiconductor. That can lead to leakage currents and isolation faults in the system, which will trip the inverter and shut down the array. In such cases, service teams have to make site visits to switch arrays back on, adding expense and loss of income to a site owner's costs.
In the past, modules suffering in that manner had to be swapped, which may be no easy task if the power class of the new module needs to be the same as that of the device it is replacing. If voltage or current differs on a replacement panel, it cannot simply be integrated into an existing string and new electrical layouts need to be made, which involves planning and engineering work.
DuPont has come to the rescue with its PV Rescue Tape, at a fraction of the cost of panel replacement. The material is a Tedlar-based backsheet that comes with butyl rubber adhesive. Faulty modules can be dismounted in the field by a trained service group from Sc-refit GmbH, an affiliate of Suncycle GmbH. The service crew can fit the new backsheet onto the module using a proprietary tool or there is the opportunity of sending modules to Sc-refit’s repair centers.
“We are delighted to be partnering with DuPont to support this much-needed solution for the PV market,” said Sc-refit chief executive Roberto Gacitua. “There is great demand from both module manufacturers and asset owners for repair products which can help extend the usable lifetime of solar panels. Our specialized repair process, customized for Tedlar PV Rescue Tape, reduces costs versus a full replacement of affected panels. It also helps to improve overall returns on investment of solar assets, making it a win-win solution for everyone involved.”
The solution can be applied to any type of backsheet and is designed to stick to severely cracked surfaces. Sc-refit will commercialize the solution in Europe. The partner will accredit and operate a network of service partners to accommodate rapid deployment of the product.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/07/cadmium-free-kesterite-solar-cell-with-9-82-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 7, 2021",Cadmium-free kesterite solar cell with 9.82% efficiency,"Scientists from Chonnam National University in South Korea have fabricated a heterojunction kesterite (CZTSSe) solar cell based on a zinc sulfide oxide Zn(O,S) buffer layer, which was used as an alternative to toxic cadmium sulfide (CdS), which is common in kesterite devices.
The researchers used a one-minute ammonium sulfide (NH4)2S treatment process for surface cleaning and passivation of the cell's CZTSSe absorber. The process is intended at removing oxides and hydroxides from the absorber layer.
The Zn(O,S) films were deposited through atomic layer deposition (ALD) at a substrate temperature of 90 degrees Celsius. The CZTSSe-absorber layers were synthesized on a soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate coated with molybdenum (Mo).  Copper-tin-zinc (Cu-Sn-Zn) metal films were deposited on the SLG/Mo substrate by direct current (DC) sputtering. The CZTSSe-absorber layers were synthesized, again, by rapid thermal annealing in a graphite box and then exposed to potassium cyanide (KCN) etching for two minutes.
The performance of the device was assessed through J–V measurements under one-sun illumination and compared to that of a similar cell developed without the (NH4)2S treatment. The latter showed a power conversion efficiency of 7.46%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.483 V, a short-circuit current of 34.4 mA cm², and a fill factor of 0.45. The cell treated with (NH4)2S exhibited a much higher efficiency at 9.82% and a remarkable fill factor of 0.56, with the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current being 0.496 V and 35.6 mA cm², respectively.

“Increasing the (NH4)2S treatment duration resulted in a gradual decrease in the FF and, thus, low cell efficiency,” the scientists noted, adding that the cell efficiency remained much higher than that of the cell without the treatment. “Further, it is worth noting that the cell efficiency obtained herein is the highest efficiency reported for the CZTSSe-based thin-film solar cells fabricated with the ALD-Zn(O,S) buffer layer.”
“The cell was so far developed with a small size and at the laboratory level,” the research main author, Jaeyeong Heo, told pv magazine. “It is currently hard to estimate its costs for production.” The research team claimed its findings are encouraging for the development of cadmium-free Zn(O,S) buffer layer-based kesterite solar cells fabricated by completely vacuum-based processes.
A thorough description of the cell and its fabrication process can be found in the paper CZTSSe/Zn(O,S) heterojunction solar cells with 9.82% efficiency enabled via (NH4)2S treatment of absorber layer, which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
The article was amended to reflect that the Chonnam National University is located in South Korea and not in China, as we previously reported.

The VGF scheme is usually utilized through public-private partnerships to support large infrastructure projects by providing a capital grant at a certain stage of project construction. This kind of support is, in general, available only when projects are selected through a process of competitive bidding.
The AEPC on June 3 issued a call for concept to help developers and regional governments submit their project proposals. Applications will have to be submitted by July 4.
Selected projects will be financially backed by the recently established Sustainable Energy Challenge Fund (SECF) and funds provided by the U.K. government.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, Nepal had installed solar power of 60 MW at the end of 2020. Around 95% of its population currently has access to electricity and its installed capacity comes mostly from around 1.1 GW of hydropower.

High-level officials from both companies were in attendance in Shanghai on Thursday to announce the partners will work closely to establish a national photovoltaic-technology personnel training center; and a smart energy production facility; factory and big data facility, to help develop the Chinese PV market.
BYD Solar debuted several modules at the event, including a half-cut, 210mm-wafer based product; a 182mm module; a 182mm bifacial, duo-glass device; and TOPCon (tunnel-oxide passivated contact) and heterojunction panels.

With BYD better known for electric vehicle production, general manager Bi Guozhong said the business is focusing on the rapidly growing solar market and is playing catch-up with more established PV manufacturers with the intent of making up the ground within one to two years.
Bi said BYD's heterojunction panels promise great potential as they offer the chance to harness perovskite technology and potentially lift module efficiency to new highs.
Inverter maker Sineng used Thursday's opening day of SNEC to announce its 1500 V, large-current inverter – with a maximum power of 352 kW and rated power of 320 kW – has been listed in its product portfolio as ready for market.
Compatible with solar modules based on 182mm and 210mm wafers, Sineng says the device offers 20 A and has an MPPT (maximum power point tracking) range of 500-1500 V, with a maximum input current of up to 45 A. The manufacturer said the maximum power efficiency of its 320K-H series string inverter is up to 99.93%.
LDK used SNEC to release its S series solar modules with He Liang, VP of the company's R&D center explaining the products are based on rotating casting mono-poly silicon technology, and take advantage of higher yield and lower energy costs in their production process.
The manufacturer claims an average conversion efficiency of more than 24% across its products and says its panels are produced for around 16% less than their conventional rivals.
Tracker maker Arctech Solar launched what it described as the first wireless synchronous adjustable bracket at the conference and exhibition and announced 100 MW worth of orders from state-owned solar demonstration projects.

Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
The bracket eschews the usual push-rod design for a simple screw-rod assembly which Arctech says is tolerant to harsh environmental conditions. The manufacturer said the innovation uses an independent push-rod instead of the standard push-rod assembly as its main driving force, ensuring a stable retention force at the same time as the driving force.
After removing the connecting rod, Arctech said at the SNEC exhibition which closed on Saturday, the regulating device adopts wireless signal transmission instead of the usual connecting-rod synchronous structure, and develops a new motor driver which can not only realize stepless angle adjustment from five to 60 degrees in a minute, but also ensures the consistent operation of multiple motors to enable the synchronous angle adjustment of all brackets.

The performance is up from 115 MW in the same period last year, and 105 MW in the first quarter of 2018. March was the month with the highest growth this year, at 55.3 MW, followed by February and January, with 54.38 MW and 42.1 MW, respectively.
If this growth trend would be confirmed over the rest of the year, Italy may see the largest amount of newly installed PV capacity over the past decade and, eventually, return to a gigawatt market dimension. Much will depend, however, on how many large scale PV projects will succeed in reaching completion. In 2020, the country added 625 MW of solar and in 2019, it deployed 737 MW.
According to the latest statistics, PV projects that do not exceed 1 MW in size represent almost all of the newly deployed capacity, at 145.4 MW. Solar parks over 1 MW only accounted for 6.6 MW of the total. The increasing success of rooftop PV is currently being ensured by the 110% fiscal break for rooftop PV linked to building renovations. The so-called “super-bonus” for building renovation projects, which was introduced in May 2020 to help revive the country’s economy from the Covid-19 crisis, was recently extended through 2022.
Residential PV systems up to 20 kW in size still account for the largest share, with around 69.2 MW of capacity. PV systems ranging from 20 kW to 100 kW account for 32.3 MW of the quarterly total. Meanwhile, installations of commercial and industrial PV systems ranging from 100 kW to 1 MW reached 43.7 MW in the first three months of the year.
The parts of the country with the highest development volumes are the Lombardy region, which brought 27.9 MW of new solar online, and the northern region of Veneto, with 22.6 MW. Emilia-Romagna and Sicily finished the quarter with 22.3 MW and 19.7 MW, respectively.
The provisional figures indicate that Italy exceeded 22.1 GW of solar capacity at the end of March. The nation’s National Integrated Plan for Climate and Energy aims for 50 GW of solar by 2030.

Fraunhofer ISI, Fraunhofer ISE and Fraunhofer IEG have released a joint study on future potential hydrogen demand. The report, which covers demand for hydrogen and hydrogen synthesis products, was produced on behalf of Germany's National Hydrogen Council.
The three Fraunhofer institutes evaluated current system studies, with a focus on demand for hydrogen and hydrogen-based energy sources in Germany. They found that current annual hydrogen production in Germany stands at 57 TWh and is almost entirely based on fossil fuels. The first relevant demand increase for green hydrogen and derivatives is expected by 2030, at a likely annual maximum of 80 TWh. Annual demand is then expected to grow to between 100 TWh and 300 TWh in 2040 and up to 800 TWh by 2050.
The study identifies the greatest future need for hydrogen and hydrogen-based synthesis products in the industrial sector. Up to 500 TWh will be required here by 2050, especially in the iron and steel industry and the chemical industry. The transport sector will need between 150 TWh and 300 TWh by 2050. International air and maritime traffic is expected to require between 140 TWh and 200 TWh by the middle of the current century. According to recent studies, road traffic has the greatest potential for heavy goods traffic.
The study also identifies additional customers in the building sector, with up to 200 TWh by 2050. The development of demand for hydrogen and hydrogen-based synthesis products will depend on a range of factors, including developments in the capture and storage of carbon dioxide field, as well as the amount of available and sustainable biomass capacity.
“Without the widespread use of hydrogen, we will not be able to achieve the more stringent climate targets,” said Katherina Reiche, chairwoman of the National Hydrogen Council.
The study concluded that demand in the industrial sector, as well as transport and heating, will be significantly higher than previously predicted by politicians. The rapid development of the hydrogen market, the ongoing expansion of renewable energy, and the rapid expansion and development of network infrastructure are now critical for future growth. However, the growth of the hydrogen economy and its international value chains will need to be considered within both a European and global context.

Since it started operating, at around 344 million kilometers from the Earth, the lander has accumulated dust on many of its parts, including the PV array that is crucial for repowering its batteries and keeping the machine functioning.
Although the panels are designed to provide enough power over a full Mars year even with significant dust accumulation, NASA is currently planning to hibernate the lander during the Martian winter and to shut down science instruments to keep its electronics warm.
Simultaneously, the agency has also begun to clean the panels of the array with a sort of handmade technique that is, somehow, producing interesting results. On May 22, which corresponds to the mission's 884th Martian day, the lander's robotic arm trickled sand near one solar panel, helping the wind to carry off some of the panel’s dust. The sand grains would strike dust on the panels by hopping off the solar panel surface and skipping through the air in the wind, with the larger grains being able to carry off the smaller dust particles in the wind.
“With winds blowing northwest at a maximum of 20 feet (6 meters) per second, the trickling of sand coincided with an instantaneous bump in the spacecraft’s overall power,” the agency explained. This operation was carried at noon, Mars time, which is the planet's windiest time of day, and resulted in a gain of about 30 watt-hours of energy per ‘sol,' or Martian day. “The power boost should delay the instruments being switched off by a few weeks, gaining precious time to collect additional science data,” NASA said in a statement, noting that a second attempt to clean the panels was also done on Saturday, June 5.
Despite the success of the operation, the agency said it is uncertain how much additional yield the cleaning will provide, although it gave additional helpful margin to Insight’s power reserves. At the end of the Earth summer, which corresponds to that of the Martian winter, the solar panels should be able to harvest more sunlight and turn the lander's instruments back on.
A previous, unsuccessful attempt to remove dust from the modules was done almost a year earlier by pulsing the motor that opens and closes the solar array. The use of brushes or fans to clear off dust was excluded since the beginning, as these would have added weight and possible failure points.

Most of India’s 33 GW of coal-fired power capacity currently under construction – as well as another 29 GW in the pre-construction stage – will end up stranded, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
“Coal-fired power simply cannot compete with the ongoing cost reductions of renewables. Solar tariffs in India are now below even the fuel costs of running most existing coal-fired power plants,” said author Kashish Shah, Research Analyst at IEEFA.
Compared to renewables with almost zero marginal generation costs, coal-fired generation with inflationary coal and coal transportation costs is a significantly expensive option for distribution companies. Financial distress in India’s power distribution sector makes thermal power purchase agreements (PPAs) even more unbankable.
Given these issues, investor interest in the coal sector is already waning.
“In the last 12 months, no new coal-fired power plants have been announced, and there has been no movement in the 29 GW of pre-construction capacity. This reflects the lack of financing available for new coal-fired power projects, and also the flattening of electricity demand growth,” Shah said.
Nonetheless, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) still projects that India will reach 267 GW of coal-fired capacity by 2030. This will require 58 GW of new capacity additions, or about 6.4 GW per year.
However, IEEFA says it is “highly improbable” that the CEA’s projections will materialize, given the ongoing financial and operational stress in the thermal power sector. It argues that India’s coal capacity requirements should be urgently revised.
“Any projections for India’s future generation mix should take into account that new coal-fired power plants are likely to become stranded assets,” said Shah. “The new capacity would only be economically viable if it replaced end-of-life, polluting power plants with outdated combustion technology and locations remote to coal mines.”

Heterojunction solar cells could provide the next big efficiency leap in solar output, but their need for low processing temperatures means they require very high quality, expensive n-type silicon wafers.
In recent years, significant research has been devoted to eliminating defects in low-cost p-type silicon, so that it could start to match and perhaps surpass the cost-to-efficiency ratios of the long-time hero of the photovoltaic industry – PERC technology. However, a new review of research into defect engineering in p-type wafers could reroute the path to a silicon heterojunction takeover.
Although Australia has seen record uptake of rooftop solar, the upfront costs of solar systems remain a barrier to more widespread deployment. Engineering more efficient solar cells would mean households need fewer solar panels, with attendant lower installation costs, to meet their electricity needs. And homes with small roof expanses could get more bang per solar panel.
Recent research on the performance of cheap p-type silicon wafers has shown great promise. But Dr. Matthew Wright, a solar researcher at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), says in a newly published research paper that “the same techniques can be applied to n-type wafers to improve the performance of those cells.”
Wright is an Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) post-doctoral fellow in the UNSW School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Engineering (SPREE). He worked on the final stages of the four-year Hydrogenated and Hybrid-Heterojunction P-type Silicon Solar Cells project, led by UNSW Associate Professor Brett Hallam.
Wright and PhD student Bruno Vicari Stefani recently spoke to pv magazine Australia about their research, which is based on Stefani’s PhD paper on improving p-type silicon. They also considered the work of other UNSW scientists, including Dr. Anastasia Soeriyadi, as well as researchers from the Australian National University and Arizona State University. In addition, they considered results gleaned from manufacturers who are already incorporating some of these methods into production.
Globally, a number of manufacturers are producing silicon heterojunction solar cells, including Hevel Solar. The Russian manufacturer produces 340 MW of silicon heterojunction cells per year, and claims an efficiency of 24.1%. Wright points to China's Tongwei Solar as another major silicon heterojunction manufacturer.
The thinking has been that if manufacturers could substitute cheap p-type silicon for the current standard use of n-type in silicon heterojunction production, while not sacrificing too much of the p-type efficiency, the tide of production and further development might swing toward silicon heterojunction, to give greater cost-to-efficiency benefits than PERC can now achieve. PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) technology was invented by Professor Martin Green of UNSW in the early 1980s. Speaking at this year’s Smart Energy Summit, Green said that in 2021, around 95% of global silicon solar cell production will use p-monocrystalline PERC.
PERC already uses the cheaper p-type silicon because of the very high temperatures (around 700 C) used to form the electric field in the solar cell, says Wright. The high temperatures help to solidify the metal contact points, which are screen-printed onto the cells as a metal paste. This also has a positive, or passivating, effect on the quality of the silicon.
In silicon heterojunction cells, however, the material applied to the surface of the cells, which delivers their high-voltage efficiencies, is sensitive to heat. It cannot be subjected to greater than 200 C.
“So all those kind of defect-engineering approaches that are inherent in the PERC cell fabrication, and which improve the quality of the silicon are out the window,” says Wright. “The whole point of our review and the whole point of Bruno’s thesis, is to get around that problem by treating the wafer before it goes into making the cell, and doing some kind of annealing process after the cell is finished.”
In one example, researchers at UNSW are using high-intensity laser light in a process known as “illuminated annealing.” They use this method to change structures within the cells as a final stage of production.
The cost of such processes is outlined in “Progress with Defect Engineering in Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells.” The paper was published in the 60th-anniversary edition of PSS Rapid Research Letters.
