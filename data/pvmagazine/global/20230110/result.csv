It is mainly designed for use in rented apartments and multi-family buildings, where residents often lack the resources or space to install large home batteries.
The system can be used in combination with solar panels. It includes a bidirectional charger that stores electricity in the battery via a wall socket and sends it back to the grid via the same socket. The battery’s discharge capacity is 500 W at 230 V.
When removed from its charger, the energy storage system becomes a power bank for off-grid applications. It includes two USB-C ports with 100 W of output and a 300 W AC socket at the front, which makes it suitable for working outdoors, tiny houses, and campsites, according to the company.
The cylindrical device has a diameter of 20 cm and is 40 cm high. It weighs in at 12 kg. It reportedly has a lifetime of 16 years and can purportedly run for 6,000 cycles. MyGrid claims that an average family could save between €100 ($107) and €300 a year by using the battery. It is selling the system for €1,650.
The solution includes a digital platform to manage energy savings. The software reportedly calculates the best time to charge and discharge the battery. While the platform still does not support integration into energy communities, the company plans to open it to partners to eventually integrate such services.
MyGrid is now preparing to start the functional testing phase of the new system. Commercial production is expected to start in September 2023, with the first units set to reach the market in December 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/10/solar-powered-artificial-leaf-to-produce-hydrogen-from-air/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"JANUARY 10, 2023",Solar-powered artificial leaf to produce hydrogen from air,"Chemical engineers from École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) have developed a solar-powered transparent, porous and conductive electrode, which uses an input stream of humid air to produce H2.
The electrode’s substrate is a three-dimensional mesh of felted glass fibers, a type of glass wool, which is essentially quartz. The silicon oxide fibers are then fused together at high temperatures to produce felt wafers. The wafers are initially coated with a transparent thin film of fluorine-doped tin oxide, and then with a thin-film of sunlight-absorbing semiconductor materials.
“The coating of various semiconductors on the substrates is established including Fe2O3 (chemical bath deposition), CuSCN and Cu2O (electrodeposition), and conjugated polymers (dip coating),” the scientists wrote in “Transparent Porous Conductive Substrates for Gas-Phase Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Production,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials. 
The scientists took inspiration for the electrode from the way in which plants can convert sunlight into chemical energy by using carbon dioxide from the air.
“Since each step is relatively simple and scalable, I think that our approach will open new horizons for a wide range of applications starting from gas diffusion substrates for solar-driven hydrogen production,” said Marina Caretti, the lead author of the project.
The scientists did not formally study the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency in their demonstration, but they acknowledge that it is modest for this prototype. 
“Based on the materials used, the maximum theoretical solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of the coated wafer is 12%, whereas liquid cells have been demonstrated up to 19% efficient,” said the EPFL engineers. They worked in collaboration with Toyota Motor Europe.
To examine the possibility of the transparent porous conducting substrate (TPCS)-based photocathode to produce H2 in a gas-phase environment, the team constructed a half-gas phase cell composed of two compartments. The anode side operated in an acidic liquid electrolyte, while the electrode was pressed into a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) to form a photoelectrode-membrane assembly. 
They concluded that the TPCS is “a promising substrate for the further development of the PEM-PEC concept and other applications where high porosity, conductivity, and transparency are required.”
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) technology produces hydrogen from water by using sunlight and specialized semiconductors known as “photoelectrochemical materials.” The scientists will now work on a fully functional photosynthetic fuel cell using the new electrode.

In the first call, the Slovenian authorities are accepting applications for simple PV systems without storage, as well as installations combined with batteries. They will grant a maximum rebate of €50/kW installed for simple PV systems, and €500/kW for projects paired with batteries. For both types of projects, the rebate must not exceed 25% of the total investment.
In the second call, Eko Sklad will accept applications for sustainable heating solutions, including solar thermal panels, heat pumps, and biomass boilers. In this case, the rebate may not exceed 20% of the total investment. The agency will begin allocating the funds from March 1.
Slovenia reached a cumulative installed solar capacity of around 724 MW at the end of 2022, according to provisional figures provided to pv magazine by the Slovenian Photovoltaic Association (SPA).
The Slovenian government recently prepared draft legislation to simplify the permitting process for renewables and ramp up deployment, particularly for large-scale PV. In June, it announced a plan to deploy 1 GW of solar by 2025. It has since identified go-to-areas for large-scale PV.

For manufacturers, the bill contains tax incentives for domestic fabrication, including an increase in the investment tax credit available, from 30% to 40% for projects using domestic content, as well as production tax credits linked to specific products. But the real benefit is the timeframe, which extends the bill’s credits and incentives for 10 years, making manufacturing investment tenable for the first time.

The US market has always been one of the biggest that has attracted solar module suppliers. As a global manufacturer of solar modules and mounting structures, Philadelphia Solar has had its sights set on this market for years. We see the future being not just in supplying modules but in investing in the US to set up domestic manufacturing capacity. We took serious steps towards this in 2020 by putting a bid on a building in Texas to set up US manufacturing operations. However, we pulled back because of changes in regulation – namely the cancellation of Section 201 trade tariffs on imported bifacial solar modules. The exclusion of bifacial products from a trade tariff imposed because of the volume of imports, meant that, if we were to invest in production capacity for US-made bifacial modules, we would have faced extreme pricing headwinds from imported bifacial products. In the absence of any other incentives, our return on investment would have been untenable.
As a multinational tier-1 solar module manufacturer, it would have made more sense for us to export our monocrystalline PERC (passivated emitter, rear contact) modules to the US market, rather than manufacturing them in-country. Of course, that would also have meant that the supply of bifacial panels to the US market would have continued to be subject to supply-chain pressures which, even while remaining unknown, still presented a lower risk to us than the investment required to set up US manufacturing in the pre-IRA trading environment.
To be clear, the only way to bring stability to the US solar market is to open doors for high-quality, US-made solar modules, particularly monocrystalline bifacial modules, which are widely seen as essential for utility scale solar development. The lessons of the past few years have taught the world that energy independence must be based on viable local sources. Currently, the US solar market is dominated by outside manufacturers, including those accused of price dumping. While efforts have been made to curtail unfair trade practices, US trade regulations are imposed for two years before they are reviewed. A judge can stop these at any time, making the long-term investment necessary to set up viable manufacturing facilities too risky. Investment in US manufacturing, by companies like ours, is critical to bringing true energy independence to the US and it requires a much longer investment period than the usual regulatory cycles allow.
The IRA dramatically changed all this. The 10-year timeline for the bill’s provisions has brought us clarity over an extended period for the first time. Now we can move forward with confidence in implementing a two-pronged strategy that aligns perfectly with the US market and its solar ambitions.
Through a joint-venture with US-based Translucent Energy, we can immediately offer competitively-priced, high-quality bifacial and black modules made in our Middle East facility, to meet the current market demands for these panels. At the same time, by moving forward on our plans to set up domestic manufacturing under the Philadelphia Solar USA brand name, we are on track to supply US-made monocrystalline PERC units by 2024 at a better price point. We also are actively transitioning all our manufacturing facilities to heterojunction (HJT) solar manufacturing, so we will be able to bring higher-efficiency domestic modules at increasingly lower price points by 2025.
In the long run, we are hoping for more than just the IRA. Of the 11 raw materials we need to build a panel in the US, seven need to be imported and all of these are currently subject to tariffs.
The IRA’s tax credits and other incentives are attractive enough to offset such trade measures but it’s critical to understand that almost half of the cash we will receive back through the IRA will go to pay customs duties on raw materials. With the remaining 50% of tax-related cashback, we will still be profitable producing a US-made panel that can compete with bifacial imports that continue to be excluded from Section 201 tariffs. The margins are slim, however.
As domestic US production accelerates, there is a reasonable expectation that the bifacial exception from 201 tariffs will not be extended past its current term. Reimposing such duties would bring greater profitability to US-based manufacturers in the near future. This is essential. While we are excited to be playing an active role in bringing a clean and independent energy future to the US we, like all the manufacturers involved, must also be profitable if that future is to be sustainable.

Germany’s Centrotherm has secured orders for more than 10 GW of solar cell production line equipment from India. The orders have been placed by six different customers. 
“The spectrum of order includes existing customers with repeat orders, customers that are new to solar PV manufacturing, and customers that plan vertical integration by adding cell manufacturing to augment their module line,” it said.
The order includes production solutions and services for a 4 GW PERC solar cell line, scheduled for delivery in 2023. Centrotherm said the €57 million ($61.2 million) order will contribute to the high utilization of its production capacities in Blaubeuren, Germany, and Kunshan, China.  
Centrotherm’s order book has swelled, as several companies in India have started focusing on cell manufacturing due to strong government policy support. Production-linked incentives for solar PV manufacturing, the imposition of basic customs duty on solar cells and modules, and local procurement requirements for projects under government schemes have driven more and more companies to look at local components production.
Demand for locally produced solar PV cells and modules is expected to grow significantly over the next several years to meet India's 500 GW renewables target by 2030.

Waste-to-fuel processes are in focus for many leading researchers that are seeking opportunities to reduce pollution, mitigate climate change, and make low-cost, sustainable fuel. The latest in such innovations comes from the University of Cambridge, where researchers have developed a system to use electricity from solar panels to power plastics-to-fuel and carbon dioxide-to-fuel processes. The results were reported in Nature Synthesis.
The system can convert two waste streams into two chemical products at the same time. This is the first time that a process has been achieved in a solar-powered reactor. The reactor converts CO2 and plastics into a variety of products that have use cases across several industries.
“Plastic pollution is a huge problem worldwide, and often, many of the plastics we throw into recycling bins are incinerated or end up in landfill,” said Erwin Reisner, a professor at Cambridge.
In early tests, CO2 was converted into syngas, a building block in sustainable liquid fuels. Plastic bottles were converted into glycolic acid, a common ingredient in skin care products. The research team said the system can be readily tuned to produce different products by changing the catalyst in the reactor.
The device addresses two of the major environmental problems faced by humanity today: waste plastics and greenhouse gases. Powering the process with solar energy helps curb further emissions that would otherwise be expelled by traditional power sources.
Rather than traditional silicon-based solar cells, the Cambridge team opted for a light absorber based on perovskite technology. The perovskite-based photocathode in the reactor was selected as it enables the integration of different CO2-reduction catalysts.
“Developing a circular economy, where we make useful things from waste instead of throwing it into landfill, is vital if we’re going to meaningfully address the climate crisis and protect the natural world,” said Reisner. “And powering these solutions using the Sun means that we’re doing it cleanly and sustainably.”
The research was supported by the European Union, the European Research Council, the Cambridge Trust, Hermann and Marianne Straniak Stiftung, and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Erwin Reisner is a fellow of St John’s College, Cambridge.
The Cambridge team said it plans to develop the reactor to produce more complex molecules over the next five years. The researchers said similar processes could be used to develop an entirely solar-powered recycling plant.
