Researchers at King Abdulaziz University recently conducted a techno-economic analysis for utility-scale wind and solar plants in Saudi Arabia. They found that current tariffs make projects economically unviable.
The Saudi Power Procurement Co. (SPPC) recently launched the fifth round of the Saudi Arabian government's National Renewable Energy Program (NREP).
The Saudi Arabian government aims to generate 27.5 GW of renewable energy by 2030, the country's leading solar lobby group said last year. This is a significant leap from the nation's current installed capacity, which was estimated at 390 MW at the end of 2022, according to the International Renewable Energy Association (IRENA).

The deals reached a total capacity of 936 MW, nearly tripling the 342 MW recorded in December 2022. Pexapark said the results mark “a robust conclusion to an already strong year in PPA activity.”
All tracked PPA prices stood at €50.20 ($54.40)/MWh at the end of December. This is down 3.9% from November and 36% lower than at the start of 2023. Pexapark said PPA prices across Europe fell as power and commodity prices recovered from record highs last year, returning closer to levels last seen before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Great Britain saw the largest month-on-month decrease in PPA price in December. Portugal and Spain experienced the smallest annual change in PPA prices throughout 2023, said Pexapark.
Spain stood out as the most active country in December, with a total of eight new PPAs. Four were underpinned by off-takers from the health care sector and three were classified as cross-border PPAs. They included a 15-year cross-border PPA tied to a 124 MW solar project near Seville, signed by Pfizer and Bruc Energy.
Sweden recorded two PPAs in December, including a deal between Axpo, Egmont, and Soltech Energy Solutions, who joined forces for an 11 MW solar plant near Falkenberg, Sweden. Meanwhile, four new PPAs were announced in Germany, bringing the country’s total in 2023 to 41 deals for 3.7 GW, up from 23 in 2022.
The five largest PPA deals in 2023 were split between Spain and Germany, marking the first time Germany has appeared in the list of top five deals. Pexapark said PV assets accounted for the lion’s share of the largest deals for the first time, with the technology making up more than 80% of an aggregated 3 GW in the five largest deals.

The ground-mounted solar parks in Blekinge, Södermanland, and Halland will have capacities of 13 MW, 6 MW, and 4 MW. Construction has begun in Blekinge, while work on the other two parks will start in the spring.
The projects, which are expected to be operational by early 2025, will provide H&M with at least 24 GWh of clean electricity.
The deal builds on an existing partnership between the two companies. In December 2022, Alight and French renewable energy developer Neoen signed Sweden’s largest PPA to date with H&M, to sell power to the fashion retailer from a 100 MW solar plant in Hultsfred, southern Sweden. The plant is currently under construction and will be the country's largest solar project upon completion.
“This commitment by H&M Group makes the projects viable and adds new green power capacity to the Swedish grid. It’s a win for both corporate and community sustainability,” said Harald Överholm, CEO and co-founder of Alight.
In December 2022, Alight and Neoen secured Sweden's largest PPA to date. The two companies agreed to sell power to H&M from a 90 MW solar plant, which is now under development in Hultsfred, Sweden.
In December 2021, Alight signed a five-year PPA for an 18 MW solar park with Swedish restaurant group Martin & Servera. And in June 2021, it signed a 10-year deal for an 8 MW solar park it wants to build at an unspecified location in southern Sweden.

CEO Mehdi Honarvar told PV magazine that the company is currently negotiating contracts for the deployment of the system.
“We are looking for a location that allows us to start a pilot project,” Honarvar said. “This kind of technology is unique as we talk about open sea. Many countries are currently looking to shift their focus from ground PV to floating PV.”
The company said in a statement that the novel structure can withstand winds of up to 160 km/h, with a lifespan of 30 years. It features a steel structure and corrosion-resistance coating. It will be supported by 30 floating pontoons.
“Those pontoons can create the highest safety during wind and hurricane,” said Honarvar. “We also have a patent for offshore floating breakwater, which, among other use cases, can supply additional protection for floating solar projects.”
Honavar said each floating platform has an area of 900 square meters x 32 meters x 28.12 meters. It can support up to 200 solar modules in capacities up to 700 W, with a total weight of 50,000 kg, including panels.
Developers can also install the panels at any angle, including bifacial modules, according to the company.
“Our floating solar structure is so designed that it prevents solar panels from flooding when exposed to 2-meter wave height and does not need a separate wave breaker,” the company said. “Also, the existing structure itself leads to wave cancellation of at least 45%. In case of high tides with high water level changes, there will be no problem.”

ICRA has maintained a stable outlook for the renewable energy sector, led by strong policy support, healthy demand prospects, and tariff competitiveness. It said the realization of past dues and regular payments of ongoing bills by distribution companies following the launch of the late payment surcharge (LPS) scheme are also positives for the sector.
ICRA expects India to add 18 GW to 20 GW of renewable energy capacity in fiscal 2024 and about 25 GW in fiscal 2025, compared to 15 GW in fiscal 2023. Much of this capacity addition will be from solar projects. New solar capacity additions in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 are expected to reach 17 GW and 20 GW, respectively.
“The sharp decline in solar PV cell and module prices, abeyance of the order on Approved List of Models and Module Manufacturers (ALMM) till March 2024, and the timeline extension approved for solar and hybrid projects, are expected to lead to an improvement in renewable energy capacity addition to 18 GW to 20 GW in fiscal 2024 from 15 GW in fiscal 2023,” said Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president and group head – corporate ratings for ICRA.
However, Kadam said that challenges remain on the execution front concerning delays in land acquisition and transmission connectivity. He said this could hamper prospects for capacity additions.
ICRA said the all-India thermal plant load factor (PLF) will continue to improve to 69.0% in fiscal 2025, from about 68% projected for fiscal 2024, led by growth in electricity demand and limited thermal capacity additions.
ICRA’s outlook for the thermal power segment is “stable,” supported by a healthy improvement in the thermal PLF, along with the reduction in dues from state distribution utilities following the implementation of the LPS scheme in August 2022.
The ratings agency said it expects demand growth to moderate to 5.5-6.0% in fiscal 2025 from the 7.0% to 7.5% projected for fiscal 2024.
“The current under-construction thermal capacity is about 30 GW, which is predominantly in the central and the state-owned generation segment and is expected to be commissioned over the next two to four-year period. In our view, there is a clear need for incremental capacity beyond this pipeline if the annual electricity demand growth continues to exceed 6.0% till 2030, after factoring in the renewable capacity addition,” Kadam said. “If annual demand growth is stronger at 7.5% till 2030, to meet the same, the incremental thermal capacity requirement will need to be as large as 70 GW.”
Coal has remained a dominant fuel source to meet India’s baseload power demand, and its share in the overall energy generation mix is expected to fall from 73% in fiscal 2023 to about 58% to 60% in fiscal 2030, assuming 200 GW of renewable capacity addition between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2030, according to ICRA estimates. Nonetheless, it noted that the share of coal in the generation mix is expected to remain significant until 2030.

Spain-based project developer Grenergy said it has secured a long-term PPA for a large-scale solar-plus-storage project under development in Chile by an unspecified power utility with an investment-grade credit rating.
Grenergy said the PPA has a duration of 15 years and relates to the fourth phase of its massive 1 GW/4 GWh Oasis de Atacama solar-plus-storage project. The fourth phase of the project has a capacity of 260 MW/1,100 MWh.
Grenergy said it will supply close to 8 TWh to the utility during the aforementioned period, with supply beginning in the second quarter of 2026, “although the plant is expected to come into operation in 2025.”
The PPA follows the company's announcement of its first long-term PPA for 2 GWh corresponding to the first three phases of Oasis de Atacama. Grenergy plans to invest up to $1.4 billion in the project, and with this contract would already have 75% of its planned capacity closed under PPAs, is said.
Last week, Greenergy said it acquired 1.1 GWh of batteries for the Oasis de Atacama project, based on an agreement with BYD, for the first two phases of the storage-plus-solar project.

BWP, the German heat pump association, has reported that around 356,000 heat pumps were sold in Germany last year. By comparison, the country deployed approximately 236,000 units in 2022.
The trade body said that heat pump sales rose by more than 50% for the second year in a row last year.
“This year must not be a wasted year for the heating transition,” BWP CEO Claus Fest said. “While sales skyrocketed in the first half of 2023, the very destructive and misleading debate about the Buildings Energy Act lasted a long time, and waiting for the new funding framework noticeably paralyzed the market, especially in the last quarter … If our capacities were anything to go by, the target of 500,000 heat pumps agreed with the federal government would be achievable this year.”
The industry has invested in production expansion and training capacity and prepared for the heat pump ramp-up in recent years, according to Fest. He said the climate policy goal of 6 million heat pumps by 2030 is also realistic.
“The trend in sales has been declining since June 2023. The most recent slump in December 2023 is particularly alarming,” added BWP Managing Director Martin Sabel. “If the general conditions do not improve and politicians do not actively intervene, we expect sales to remain the same or even decline in 2024.”
Energy prices are a key factor in achieving climate goals in the building sector, the BWP said. Anyone who installs a heat pump at the moment is already saving a lot of CO2, thereby protecting themselves from rising CO2 prices for fossil fuels and ultimately saving money. However, switching to a heat pump only becomes particularly attractive for many consumers when the ratio of gas to electricity prices is one to two and a half or less.
Against this background, it is incomprehensible that heat pump electricity still has twice the taxes, levies and levies as natural gas, said Sabel. He urged politicians to create fair competition conditions and to ensure that fossil energy is at least no longer favored.

That would mark a sixfold increase on the 1.39 GW of solar in Romania in 2020.
Image: Econergy
By the end of 2023 – as Romania became the 118th member of the International Solar Alliance group of tropical nations – the country had reached 2.9 GW of solar.
Romania is positioning itself to become a major player in European Union renewables. Trade body SolarPower Europe’s latest European Union market outlook report ranked Romania among its top ten growth markets for the first time, alongside Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands.
In late 2023, the Romanian government raised the ambition of the draft National Energy and Climate Plan it presented to the COP. The new plan aims for 36% of Romania’s energy to come from renewables by 2030 – higher than the figure allocated it by the European Commission – with 8.3 GW of solar and 7.6 GW of wind. Bucharest has committed to phase out coal by 2032.
Econergy identified Romania as an important European renewables player at the end of the 2010s and has become a leading developer and investor in Romanian PV. We have learned where Romania’s bold commitments create opportunity, where growth is delayed, and how Romania is weathering current international challenges.
Solar regulation
Legislation has been introduced, since 2021, to ease solar deployment. For example, 2022 brought a legal amendment easing the use of agricultural land for PV until 2026, likely to maximize absorption of European Union funds during the bloc’s 2021-27 budget.
Improved permitting processes mean utility scale PV projects with a footprint of less than 50 hectares take an average of 6 to 12 months to secure permission, down from the previous 18 months, according to SolarPower Europe. The government is planning to tender for 2 GW of solar and onshore wind capacity in early 2024, using a first contracts-for-difference (CfD) mechanism for 15 years. Under CfD schemes, renewable energy generators bid a maximum tariff “strike price” they would accept from the government. Generators receive the strike price minus the day-ahead hourly wholesale price of electricity as a bonus on top of any payments they receive separately from the commercial sale of the power they generate. When wholesale prices are higher than the strike price, the difference is refunded to the government.
There are hurdles, however. Projects bigger than 50 hectares are not accelerating at the same pace, in part because of a Ministry of Agriculture ban on renewables sites of such scale on agricultural land. The Romanian Industry Association, investors, foreign industry, and the Romanian Wind Association want the ban lifted.
Global challenges
The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates at least 3 TW of global clean energy projects are waiting in grid connection queues, with half of them at an advanced stage of development. That is five times the amount of solar and wind installed in 2022 and Romania is not immune to such challenges.
Econergy’s first Romanian projects faced no grid connection hold-ups. Today the queue is around 50 GW, even if applicants lose their place if projects are not contracted within 12 months.
With the IEA estimating global grid investment needs to almost double by 2030, to more than $600 billion per year, Bucharest’s Grid Development Plan has dedicated more than €1 billion ($1.09 billion) to upgrading the network and adding interconnectors with neighbouring countries. Romania also stands to benefit from a European Union-wide €584 billion grid overhaul and has allocated more than €25 billion from its European Union, post-Covid Recovery and Resilience Fund (RRF) cash for businesses to invest in energy transmission.
The recency of Romania’s PV boom means it is well placed to ride the wave of urgent grid investment.
Ukraine war
The Romanian government, like many of its peers, capped energy prices after the inflation driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This has hit renewables investment even though the government pays part of the subsidy and legislators have promised new power projects will be exempt from the cap. The European Union has recommended removal of the price limit.
Despite that obstacle, industrial activity in Romania is growing, with international manufacturers who had left the nation to operate in Ukraine and Russia returning. The 2023 World Investment Report estimated foreign direct investment in Romania hit a record $11.3 billion in 2022.
Some 63% of respondents to a Romania attractiveness survey conducted by accountant Ernst & Young in 2023, said they planned to establish or expand operations in the country, up from 53% in 2022. Utility supply was cited as one of three top factors to drive Romanian economic growth. An end to the energy price cap, in 2025, will further boost confidence.
EU cash
While Romania’s RRF spending will improve electricity transmission, an avalanche of applications for clean energy project grants under the scheme overwhelmed ministries such that financing agreements were being signed in late 2023 for sites which must be completed by June 2024. While the European Union can consider late applications on a case-by-case basis, that is a time consuming affair and the volume of clean energy projects under development in Romania outweighs those under construction. In December 2023, the Ministry of Energy announced the project deadline has been extended to December 2024.
The outlook
While Romania suffers as much from an aging grid as many other nations, its regulatory framework is moving fast to address the issue. The political will is there, and international investors are seeing the opportunity Romania offers.
Econergy’s experience of developing in Romania – culminating in the recently connected 155 MWp Ratesti plant, the largest solar project in the country, providing green electricity to more than 100,000 households per year – has been characterized by abundant development land, high irradiation, stable electricity prices, and swift authorization. Econergy has 233 MW of projects under construction in the country and a pipeline of around 2 GW in development or ready to build. We are excited to continue building in Romania.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/25/radiative-cooling-tech-for-vertical-solar-panels/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MIDDLE EAST,NEW YORK,NORTH AMERICA,SAUDI ARABIA,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",LIOR KAHANA,"JANUARY 25, 2024",Radiative cooling tech for vertical solar panels,"An international research team has developed a novel radiative cooling method for vertical solar panels that uses V-shaped mirrors tailored for the thermal management on both sides of the PV panels.
Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from the atmosphere and emits more. As a result, the surface loses heat and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
“Radiative cooling facilitates the dissipation of heat from a terrestrial body to outer space and the ambient environment through thermal radiation,” the academics explained. “This cooling strategy is particularly suitable for hot PV panels as they can fully utilize the atmospheric transparency window within the 8–13 mm range, and even beyond, due to their operating temperatures being significantly higher than the ambient temperature.”
The novel cooling approach is dubbed v-PV and employs two 45-degree inclined mirrors on the two sides of a PV module. In the front size, an aluminum mirror was used, letting incident sunlight reflect on the module, while the thermal radiation from the front side can be directed to the sky. On the back side of the panel, a spectral selective reflector was installed, enabling the thermal radiation to be directed to the sky while preventing the back of a module from heating up by the scattered sunlight.
To test the proposed method, the scientists conducted three experiments – one in laboratory conditions, another in Buffalo, New York, and a third in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.
In the lab experiment, they used the v-PV with an 18 V polycrystalline module under one sun illumination and in a 1,000 Ω resistor to simulate a realistic operational scenario. “Double-sided radiative cooling can significantly reduce the operating temperature of a PV module by as much as 10.6 C, leading to an increase in the output voltage by 0.80 V,” they found.
Then, they conducted a field test in New York using the same system configuration. They compared the performance of a cooled module with that of a panel without the spectral selective mirror on the rear side (sv-PV) and that of a horizontal reference panel with no mirrors (h-PV).
“At 12:40, when solar irradiance peaked, v-PV recorded a temperature of 59.6 C, which was still 9 C lower than the h-PV system (68.6 C) and 4.7 C lower than the sv-PV module (64.3 C),” they explained. “These different operating temperatures affected the output. The v-PV achieved a Voc of 18.49 V, surpassing h-PV by 0.59 V (17.9 V) and sv-PV system by 0.20 V (18.29 V).”
The group emphasized that due to its vertical orientation and V-shaped beaming mirror, v-PV receives higher solar irradiance than h-PV at latitudes above 46 degrees. “The v-PV design can achieve significantly higher output in high latitude regions such as Europe and Canada,” they said.
In the Saudi testing field, the researchers tested a modified version of the system. They adjusted the installation angles of the solar panels to 22 degrees and the selective reflectors on the rear side to 0 degrees. The front mirror stayed unchanged at 45 degrees.
The test showed that the surface temperature of the v-PV was 54.5 C, compared to 54.7 C of the h-PV and 55.7 C of the sv-PV. That also translated to improved power, as the different setups reached maximum power of 5.77 W, 4.94 W, and 5.67 W, respectively. Conversion efficiency was 10.53% for v-PV, 10.31% for h-PV, and 10.41% for the s-PV.
The seasonal, December and January edition of pv magazine reveals the much-anticipated winners of this year’s pv magazine Awards. We also consider the ramifications of the current global oversupply of solar panels, Australia’s prospects of refining battery raw materials, and examine how the European Union’s green hydrogen ambitions are developing.
“When solar irradiance collection efficiency of the solar panel was enhanced by 15% compared to an aligned, horizontal PV module, the proposed v-PV system maintained a slightly lowered operating temperature of 0.2 C, corresponding to an increase in the maximum power output by 16.8%,” the scientists asserted.
The novel cooling tech was presented in the study “Radiative cooling for vertical solar panels,” published in iScience by academics from Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), as well as the State University of New York at Buffalo and the University of Texas at Dallas in the United States.
Radiative cooling was recently applied to solar panel cooling by researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait.

The government of Sao Paulo has announced the completion of the first phase of the UFF Araucária floating PV project on the Billings Reservoir, which is the largest reservoir in Sao Paulo.
The plant has a capacity of 7 MW and features 10,500 solar panels mounted on high-density polyethylene floats. It will operate under the country's net metering scheme.
“The plant will be the largest in the country to operate commercially in distributed generation, with generators located close to consumption centers,” the government said in a statement. “It can produce up to 10 GWh per year.”
The State of Sao Paulo Environmental Company (Cetesb) owns and operates the facility.
The plant is one of the main sustainable energy development projects in Sao Paulo and was implemented under the coordination of the Secretariat of Environment, Infrastructure and Logistics. Completion is scheduled for the end of 2025, with the delivery of another 75 MW of renewable energy caapcity.
“This plant is the realization of what we are pursuing in the state of São Paulo with clean energy, energy transition and decarbonization,” said Secretary of Environment Natalia Resende. “This means using clean energy to provide quality services combined with the environment and what means sustainability.”
In just two months, the implementation of the plant generated around 200 jobs. The plant occupies less than 0.1% of the Billings Reservoir's surface area, minimizing the total environmental impact.
“In this first phase alone, 80 direct jobs and approximately 120 indirect jobs were created,” said Emae CEO Marcio Rea. “The forecast for the next two years is a lot of work with the installation of more plants. We are 100% committed to this objective.”

Inverted perovskite cells have a device structure known as “p-i-n”, in which hole-selective contact p is at the bottom of intrinsic perovskite layer i with electron transport layer n at the top. Conventional halide perovskite cells have the same structure but reversed – a “n-i-p” layout. In n-i-p architecture, the solar cell is illuminated through the electron-transport layer (ETL) side; in the p-i-n structure, it is illuminated through the hole‐transport layer (HTL) surface.
“For scale-up, repeatable processes are of extreme importance,” the research's corresponding author, Stefaan De Wolf, told pv magazine. “Here, we show that for evaporated C60, which is the electron-selective contact material in all high-efficiency tandems, such repeatability may be an issue, depending on the quality of the source material. Using sublimated C60 resolves this issue.”
In the paper “Sublimed C60 for efficient and repeatable perovskite-based solar cells,” published in nature communications, the research team explained that C60 is common as the preferred material for ETLs in inverted solar cells, due to its small conduction band offset and large valence band offset with respect to the perovskite absorber, which in turn is beneficial to the cell electron-extraction and hole-blocking properties.
The poor solubility of this material, however, requires the use of solution-based methods such as spin-coating, spray, or blade coating, although the preferred process to ensure minimizing parasitic optical absorption caused by C60 would be thermal evaporation.
“Our findings reveal that, as a result of the heating and cooling cycles of the source material during multiple evaporation cycles, C60 undergoes a conversion into higher molecular weight structures through the fusion of C60 molecules,” the academics explained. “This transformation leads to modifications in the electronic properties of the fullerene, detrimentally affecting device performance. However, we show that further purification of as-received C60 can help to avoid these issues, and device performance remains unaffected even after repeated deposition cycles.”
Through this process, the group built a cell based on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a hole transport layer (HTL) made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx) and phosphonic acid called methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz), a perovskite absorber, the C60 ETL, a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
This cell was then stacked as the top device in a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell incorporating an anti-reflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2). Tested under standard illumination conditions, this tandem device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 30.90%, with the results being confirmed by Fraunhofer ISE CalLab.
The scientists believe these efficiency levels are encouraging and said commercial PV modules with C60 contacts are already in sight in the industry. “In addition to the potential of using sublimed C60, our work provides valuable guidance for the preparation of fullerenes that are more suitable, particularly oxygen-free, for commercial perovskite-based solar cell processing with high yield.”

New data from SunWiz shows that PV panel and system prices are at the lowest point they have been in 12 months but the average investment in a rooftop solar system remains steady with Australian households preferring to install larger systems as they combat rising electricity prices.
In its latest quarterly market update, SunWiz said wholesale pricing for panels and inverters have been on the decline in recent months while system prices fell in December 2023 to an average of AUS 1.01 ($0.66)/W – the lowest they have been since May 2022.
Despite the drop off in prices, SunWiz Managing Director Warwick Johnston said consumers are continuing to invest about AUD 9,000 per rooftop installation. They are opting for larger systems, with the average system size increasing to almost 10.5 kW in the final month of 2023.
“What we have seen in consumer spend, even as panel and system prices have come down, is that people are buying bigger systems,” he said. “They are spending the same amount as they did previously. Even as prices have come down, people have still been paying that AUD 9,000 mark because they’re buying bigger systems. The other way that they’re doing it is buying cheaper equipment.”
Johnston said consumers have been trending away from premium panels and they are now also trending away from premium inverters.
“It used to be that they put Chinese panels on a premium inverter and nowadays half of the volume is Chinese panels on a Chinese inverter,” he said.
The trend for increased capacity saw the average size of a rooftop solar system cross the 10 kW threshold for the first time in December 2023. Driven in part by an increase in commercial installations, the average size of a rooftop system rose to an all-time high of 10.47 kW.
The increase follows considerable growth in the volume of 10-15 kW systems and modest growth in the 8 kW to 10 kW segment. The volume of 6 kW systems has been trending slowly downwards.

Johnston said the figures also showed the payback period for rooftop solar investments is trending downwards with most installations paying for themselves in less than five years and households in some states, including Queensland, better off financially in as little as three years.
“It’s the healthiest payback period for a residential system for quite a while,” he said.
More than one in three Australian households have rooftop solar systems – the highest penetration in the world. Australia now sits at 3.7 GW of small-scale volume with about 23 million projects installed to date.

State-level policy is a key factor in distributed solar and energy storage markets across the United States. Policies change frequently across the 50 states, and tracking these changes are essential for businesses looking to maximize the value they provide.
The North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center maintains DSIRE, or the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency, to keep businesses and consumers up to date on distributed energy regulatory structures and related incentives. Below are 2023 trends as reported by DSIRE in a January 2024 report.
“Many states and utilities are transitioning away from traditional net metering structures and are researching or implementing new rate structures, whether that be net billing, time-of-use based net metering, or something in-between,” said Rebekah de la Mora, senior policy analyst. “These changes are not just affecting residential customers, but also non-residential customers.”
A total of 273 state and utility level distributed solar policy and rate changes were proposed, pending, or decided in 2023, said the NC Clean Energy Technology Center.
