There were multiple reports of fires involving batteries connected to residential PV systems in Germany and Austria in September. pv magazine has learned about five such incidents in the latter half of the month, with three occurring in Germany and two in Austria.
The most recent incident occurred on Sept. 29 in Kleinkahl, Germany. According to the fire department report, a single-family home experienced heavy smoke due to a technical malfunction that blew up the power storage unit of a PV system. The incident report stated that the room housing the electricity storage unit was affected.
Firefighters initially extinguished the blaze, while safely cooling the battery in a container to prevent reignition. High-performance fans were used to clear toxic fire smoke from the house. Although no one was injured, the residence is currently uninhabitable due to extensive smoke and soot damage.
Images from the fire brigade suggest that the battery may have been a product from South Korean manufacturer LG. This would make it a similar basement fire in Kochel am See, Germany, on Sept. 19.
“In the basement, a heavily smoking battery was discovered in the technical room, presumably from a PV system,” said the Kochel department. “The battery was disconnected and transported outside.”
It was then submerged in water in a steel container outdoors and cooled. The residents were not at home at the time of the incident. In this case too, no people were harmed.
A third incident occurred on Sept. 26 in Ehrenfriedersdorf, Germany. The fire department provided medical care to two individuals and a nearby highway had to be shut down as a result. It did not disclose any details regarding the origin of the storage unit.
Austria, meanwhile, was also hit by a number of solar-related fires around the same time. One incident occurred on Sept. 24 in an allotment garden settlement in Altach, Austria. When firefighters arrived, they found a shelter and an attached building fully engulfed in flames, along with an agricultural transport vehicle inside the shelter.
The fire department quickly extinguished the fire, with no injuries reported. The cause of the fire was determined to be a defective PV battery storage unit at the rear of the caravan.
On the same day, the Feldkirchen fire department in Carinthia, Austria, responded to a cellar fire. The storage model involved in this incident is not clear from the pictures taken by the emergency services. According to a local media report, residents of the home were awakened by a loud bang just before midnight, and the basement of the house caught fire.
The report suggests that the fire may have been caused by a short circuit in a PV system that ignited the batteries. One resident was taken to the Klagenfurt Clinic for smoke inhalation.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/10/cleaning-up-the-statute-book/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,POLAND",,"OCTOBER 10, 2023",Cleaning up the statute book,"From pv magazine 09/23
Polish PV project permitting, decided on the basis of conditions of development (decyzja o warunkach zabudowy), has long been relatively simple for developers to attain. However, a proposed new system would require developers to pass a local spatial development plan, which could be a considerably longer process.
According to the new law, change-of-land-use permission for solar plants would be offered only on the basis of local spatial development plans, for all arrays located on the most fertile, class I to class III agricultural land, or on forest land. The regime would also apply to arrays larger than 150 kW on less fertile, class IV agricultural land, and for projects larger than 1 MW on any other type of land. The size stipulation would be flexible for sites intended for business power production.
The recent draft legislation would offer developers the chance to secure permission before local plans are finalized, before Jan. 1, 2026. While previous planning decisions would remain valid indefinitely, those issued after the new law came into force would only be valid for five years.
On July 31, the lower house of the Polish parliament and the Senate prepared an amendment to the Energy Act which would oblige large electricity retailers to offer dynamic pricing, in line with EU regulation. The statute is now awaiting presidential sign-off.
With solar projects held up by grid capacity shortages, the legislation would also relax the rules governing generators installing direct transmission to electricity consumers, without using the grid. The Energy Act already allows direct lines, the key proposed change is a waiving of the obligation to obtain a permit from the President of the Energy Regulatory Office to build such a line. That permit requirement effectively blocks such projects because it may be issued only if the energy customer has no option of receiving electricity from the public grid.
The legislation would liberalize the construction of such direct lines and set out specific requirements. First, electricity could be supplied only from a separate production unit, that is, from a unit that has a total output going to one consumer. It would, therefore, be impossible to connect 25% of a PV plant’s nominal power output to the grid and supply the remaining power directly to a dedicated consumer. Secondly, all of the electricity supplied would have to be consumed by a dedicated consumer, that is, a user that is not connected to the power grid or is connected in a way that prevents the feeding of electricity produced at the third-party production site, to the grid. The amended statute would, however, allow the feed of excess electricity not consumed by the dedicated consumer into the grid. Any such arrangement would have to be agreed with the grid operator.
The new law would impose charges on grid-connected energy consumers for using electricity supplied via a direct line from a generator, with the fee payable to the local grid operator. The fee would not apply to customers who are not connected to the public grid and who create a type of “power island” together with the generator.
With such off-grid direct lines expected to be rare, it is anticipated most energy consumers that establish a line to a dedicated generator would have to pay the, so-called “solidarity fee,” which the statute would require to be calculated on the basis of the quantity of power supplied via the direct line. The charge would be meant to cover the maintenance costs of grid system-quality standards and ensuring the reliability of ongoing power supply. In other words, the consumer’s share of the fixed costs of transmission and distribution of grid electricity. The solidarity fee would be calculated by local grid operators.
Another approach to enable the connection of new clean energy plants to the grid without waiting for infrastructure upgrades is also worth mentioning. This is cable pooling: adding new renewables sites to the grid via existing connections.
The Senate has proposed such an option by adding a comprehensive legislative amendment to this effect, to the bill amending the Renewable Energy Sources Act and Certain Other Acts. Cable pooling is about sharing a connection between more than one generation site. Such pooling makes sense for plants with different production profiles, especially PV projects sharing connections with wind farms, as they often produce electricity at different times of the day and neither uses their full connection capacity most of the time. Cable pooling will rely on physical security measures to prevent overuse of any connection capacity assigned. The cable pooling amendment put forward by the Senate is yet to be approved by parliament.
Last but not least, the trade in PV projects in Poland shows no sign of slowing down. The market is getting more and more professional. Buyers and project developers are increasingly seeking business partners on industry portals and classified advertisement websites.

“The Philippine market is the only liberal energy market in ASEAN and the only one with a spot market, the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM),” he said. “If you go to Thailand, it's the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT); if you go to Vietnam, it's Vietnam Electricity (ENV); if you go to Indonesia, it's Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) and so forth. These are state-run and align with the energy ministry mostly – sometimes not – but the degree of freedom to operate in this market is not there for private sector players, simply because of these monopolies.”
Recent changes to foreign ownership laws have positively impacted the market, Sticher said, leading to increased activity. “The limitation on foreign ownership in the Philippines for renewable energy assets was removed in December last year, which further spurred the growth in C&I,” he said.
The Philippines’ Department of Energy enforced changes to the Renewable Energy Act in December, removing rules around 100% Filipino ownership of certain renewable energy assets. “Mostly locals” are winning these new government tenders, Sticher said, with projects expected to be delivered next year.
However, obstacles remain, the analyst added, including a lack of government-built infrastructure. “Transmission lines don't go [up] from one day to the other so there would be years, one or two years [before connection],” he said, warning if the government lagged on developing infrastructure it could lead to market “stagnation.” Sticher added that the Philippines’ archipelagic geography – it comprises 7,640 islands – poses another challenge, as the country lacks a ‘developed grid' which makes it difficult to connect large-scale solar PV plants to the network.
Sticher also said the Philippines’ government regulatory framework surrounding C&I permits is not as complex compared to other ASEAN countries, such as Thailand, “and there seems to be no threat of limiting this segment through regulations, such as frequently seen in other ASEAN countries, mostly pursued by the respective state-owned utilities.”
Overall, he is confident that: “The Philippines in general is a place to do solar energy. If I were to develop a project right now, I would do a project in the Philippines.”
The comments come off the back of the Philippines’ first canal-top solar irrigation project coming online, as well as recent numerous plans to develop floating solar PV arrays in the region being trumpeted.
The Philippines aims to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030, with a possible focus on mini-grids and standalone clean power systems due to the country's archipelagic nature, according to a 2022 report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

The novel encapsulant material is based on glass fiber-reinforced composite material with an epoxy matrix containing cleavable ether groups. “The aim was to provide the encapsulating material and PV modules with enhanced chemical recyclability while retaining photovoltaic performance and durability,” the research group explained. “Further work will consider improving the moisture barrier properties of the composite, and adjusting the recycling conditions to allow component recovery valid for new modules.”
The researchers fabricated twelve solar module samples using monocrystalline silicon cells and encapsulated them with the new material using a linear vacuum resin infusion process. “As reinforcement, a glass fiber fabric with a 300 g/m2 (0/90◦) areal weight was used. The reinforcement layout consisted of 3 layers placed at the front and back of the cell. As a composite matrix, an epoxy resin system with amine base hardener and cleavable chemical groups in its composition was used,” they noted.
The group tested the performance of the panels and compared it to reference modules encapsulated with a standard resin system based on a clear bisphenol-A epoxy and an amine-based crosslinker. In the set of tests, the recyclable encapsulants were tested against the reference encapsulant, as well as bare solar cells without any kind of encapsulation.
“The data of the monomodules with the composite encapsulant based on the recyclable epoxy resin showed an electrical loss in short-circuit current of 6.3% when comparing the electrical performance before and after encapsulation,” the researchers said. “This value was slightly lower than the one obtained for the monomodules with standard epoxy composite, which presented a decrease of 7.2%.”
The group observed a similar trend when analyzing the power at maximum point (Pmp) losses and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, a metric for the efficiency and spectral response of photovoltaic devices.
The researchers also conducted a damp-heat test for 500 hours of exposure on the panel encapsulated with the new material, and found it showed an electrical loss in short-circuit current of 3.4%, which compared to only 1.5% for the benchmark panel.
“After 1000 h exposure, the observed short-circuit current decrease was even more pronounced, being significantly higher for the cleavable epoxy matrix,” the academics noted. “A final loss of 4.9% was measured for recyclable resin, whereas the standard epoxy showed a lower value of 2.8%. Regarding Pmp values, the loss reached 4.7% and 3.4% for the recyclable and standard composite respectively.”
In addition, the researchers carried out stability and aging tests for UV exposure and thermal cycling. As for the latter, it presented a loss of around 1% in short-circuit current and Pmp, which is not considered significant, as it is below the measurement accuracy of the technique. As for the UV exposure, electrical losses were also close to 1%.
The novel material was described in the paper “Composite material with enhanced recyclability as encapsulant for photovoltaic modules,” published in Heliyon.
Looking ahead, the researchers noted future work needed in both analysis and improvement of surface homogeneity, as well as studying the aging performance of the modules made with the recovered fibers, and possibly using a different resin-fiber interface.  Additionally, the researchers see opportunity to improve the proposed technology. “Future work will also be focused on improving the damp-heat stability of the composite, in a trade-off with a successful recyclability,” they stated.

NLC India, a mining company under India’s Ministry of Coal, has won an 810 MW solar PV project from Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Nigam Ltd. (RRVUNL).
NLC secured the entire 810 MW capacity in RRVUNL's December 2022 tender. The project will be located in RRVUNL's 2 GW Ultra Mega Solar Park in Pugal tehsil, Bikaner district, Rajasthan. RRVUNL will supply the project with land and the power evacuation system linked to the state transmission utility, expediting project completion.
NLC said the planned installation in Rajasthan is the largest renewable project to be developed by the company. With this project, its power project capacity in Rajasthan will reach 1.36 GW, including 1.1 GW of green power.
“Considering the good solar radiation in Rajasthan, a higher capacity utilization factor (CUF) for the project is possible and [the project is expected to] generate green power of more than 50 billion units and offset more than 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions during its lifetime,” stated NLC.
NLC is currently establishing various solar projects, including a 50 MW project on mined-out land, a 300 MW solar project in Barsingsar, Bikaner district, and a 600 MW project in Khavda, Bhuj district, Gujarat.
Prasanna Kumar Motupalli, chairman and managing director of NLC, said NLC is developing 2 GW of renewable energy capacity across India, with plans to expand to more than 6 GW by 2030.

Analysts from Rystad Energy reported that 40 GW of modules were stored in June in Rotterdam’s port warehouses.
“We’re excited to introduce sun.store, with the goal of making buying and selling PV equipment easier and more efficient,” says Agata Krawiec-Rokita, sun.store co-founder and CEO. The newly-launched, multinational platform aims to allow PV companies with available stock to expand their reach and target installers who may be interested in their products.
For buyers, they say it provides access to multiple offers from numerous vendors, across brands and countries. Krawiec-Rokita says the platfom gives simple and clear information on equipment prices and availability and that it was “designed to make it much quicker for installers to find the equipment they need, potentially cutting the time they spend on searching in half.”
According to the company, installers can feel safe shopping online thanks to secure payment options. Sellers, in turn, will benefit from the ease of entry into new markets, the ability to liquidate excess stock, and diversified sales channels.
The company has already gained some visibility. It  has been recognized with the “Promising Startups of RE Industry” award at the 4th Solar Energy Storage Future Spain Conference.

The London-based company’s head of flexibility markets, Alex Howard, told pv magazine that the announcement means the country’s major distribution network operator – responsible for 8.5 million customers – will manage “demand growth” and get more renewables connected to the grid.
“Last year, for the first time, and last week, for the second time, we've gone out to say, ‘Actually, we do have that challenge and we're going to use flexibility for that challenge',’” he said of the tender announcement. “But we're also going to use flexibility to help get more renewables connected because, in parts of our network, there is a big queue, both solar and wind farms and batteries, who wants to connect but who aren't yet able to.”
The challenge, he said, is rising demand created by customers relying on lower carbon-producing energy sources and more electric technologies. Project attrition for renewable projects is also posing its own problems, with Howard stating if the UK wanted to hit net zero carbon emissions, the more the company could do to “pull them [the projects] forward, the better.” He did not clarify how many projects were gridlocked.
Provisionally successful applicants will be announced in January 2024, with contracts commencing over the summer. UK Power Networks launched its first flexibility tender of 95 MW in 2019, and will continue to run annual flexible tender programs until the foreseeable future, Howard added.
UK Power Networks’ press release states the opportunities range from “just a few hours of flexible provision” and “as little as 10 KW per zone”, with the company looking for, “opportunities to create new revenue streams by ensuring that the region’s power distribution infrastructure is not over-loaded and renewable energy is prioritized.”
Flexibility means regulating the outputs between renewable energy generators – such as batteries and wind turbines – with customers who can “sign up to reduce their demand at peak times to benefit financially,” the release adds. It is the ability to change generation or consumption patterns to support the electricity system, rather than building new infrastructure, such as substations.
UK Power Networks' flexibility team, according to Howard, is tasked with finding smart solutions to rising demand.
“Twice a year, we go out and run that process, and try to sign those commercial agreements, different players, to kind of moderate how they use the network, in order to make better use of that capacity,” he said. If UK Power Networks didn’t follow this formula, and were to instead build the network for the size of what was coming, Howard estimates the company would spend £410 million ($503.1 million) more over the next five years to meet demand.
The UK’s solar PV cumulative capacity was 15,292.8 MW at the end of July, with newly installed capacity for the first seven months of this year reaching 643 MW, recent data published by Great Britain’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) show.

They claim the system may cover the entire electricity demand of island resorts.
The scientists proposed to utilize their multi-renewable energy system, which also relies on battery storage, for the Hurawalhi Island Resort, in the Maldives. “The reason to consider the solar-tidal system is that the Maldives has an excellent clearness index and tidal range,” they specified.
Based on their assessment using NREL's HOMER software, the academics analyzed all potential system configurations and then arranged the systems according to the best variable. They assumed the peak load demand of the Hurawalhi Resort to be 451 kW, with the average load demand being 101.01 kW. They also assumed the energy system to generate 2424.25 kWh/day.
Under the proposed system configuration, the PV system had a capacity of 664 kW and a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of 0.0267$/kWh. The system also relies on a 424 kW converter, a 120 kW tidal turbine and batteries with a combined storage capacity of 2,000 kWh.
“The mean output of a solar energy system is 160 KW and 3839 kWh/day, with a capacity factor of 24.1%,” the research group explained, noting that the hours of operation enabled by the solar energy system is 4380 hrs/year.
Furthermore, the mean output of the tidal turbine is 22.5 KW with a capacity factor of 18.8 % and hydrokinetic penetration of 22.3%. The hours of operation are 8760 hrs/year, with a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of 0.0314$/kwh.

Through their analysis, the scientists also found that the overall system has a net present cost of $1359,438 and an LCOE of 0.1189$/kwh. “The electricity production through the solar and tidal systems is 1401,086 kWh/day and 197,509 kWh/day, respectively,” they further explained. “This is a totally 100 % renewable energy system, where solar and tidal system contribution is 87.6% and 12.4%, respectively.”
They also validated the cost modeling with chaotic particle swarm optimization and cuckoo optimization techniques, concluding that the analysis shows the reliability and ‘maintainability' of the proposed system. They also warned, however, that the combination of these two technologies requires careful consideration of the local geography, weather patterns, and tidal currents.
“To mitigate this bottleneck, a thorough site assessment should be conducted before designing the system to ensure that the project is economically viable and environmentally sustainable,” they concluded.
The system was introduced in the study “Design, optimization, and data analysis of solar-tidal hybrid renewable energy system for Hurawalhi, Maldives,” published in Cleaner Energy Systems.

The French government has officially approved the anticipated decree to increase the maximum distance between members of energy communities for self-consumption from 2 km to 20 km.
Under the new regulations, collective self-consumption initiatives can expand up to 10 km in peri-urban regions and up to 20 kilometers in rural areas. This perimeter specifies the distance between the two farthest participants within an energy community. To meet these updated criteria, the organizing legal entity must still apply for an exemption from the previous distance requirement.
“The municipalities that can be considered as having a rural character are those belonging to the categories rural towns, rural environments with dispersed habitat and rural environment with very dispersed habitat,'” the French authorities said. “The municipalities that can be considered as having a peri-urban character are those belonging to the small towns and urban belts categories of the municipal density grid established by the National Institute of Statistics.”
In March, France introduced energy communities after an extensive pilot phase. The energy community concept unites nearby consumers and PV energy producers into a single self-consumption entity.
Likewise, several other European countries, such as Italy, Spain, and Portugal, have implemented measures to facilitate the growth of energy communities.

The most significant reductions in emissions were observed in the European Union, followed by Japan, the United States, and South Korea. The reductions were primarily due to decreased coal generation, particularly in the United States, the European Union, Japan, and South Korea.
Ember said that achieving “peak” fossil emissions in the electricity sector is a critical milestone in the transition to a clean, electrified economy. The report noted that accelerating the deployment of wind and solar energy will be essential to achieving a rapid decline in emissions this decade.
Ember said the primary measure governments can take to put the world on a 1.5 C path is to triple global renewable capacity by 2030. In the first half of 2023, wind and solar were the only two sources of electricity that significantly increased their share of the global electricity supply, rising to 14.3% from 12.8% the previous year. However, their generation growth was slower compared to the same period in 2022, with solar increasing by 16% (compared to 26% in the first half of 2022).
In the first half of 2023, 50 countries achieved new monthly records for solar generation, with China leading in solar generation growth, followed by the European Union, the United States, and India.
Wind energy grew by 10% in the first half of 2023, compared to 16% in the same period in 2022.
Despite these gains, fossil generation increased slightly to compensate for the hydroelectricity deficit (-8.5%, or -177 TWh). According to Ember, emissions from the electricity sector would have decreased by 2.9% if global hydro generation had remained at the same level as the previous year.
However, lower electricity demand helped limit further global emissions growth, with global electricity demand increasing by only 0.4% in the first half of 2023 compared to the previous year. This is significantly lower than the average annual growth rate of 2.6% between 2012 and 2022. High-income economies, including Japan, the European Union, the United States, and South Korea experienced a decline in demand, leading to lower fossil fuel consumption. In contrast, India saw demand growth of 3.1%.

“Our research demonstrates that crystalline silicon solar cell modules with a PET film cover are highly reliable under high-temperature and high-humidity conditions,” the research's corresponding author, Tomihisa Tachibana, told pv magazine. “While we haven't yet calculated the system cost, we anticipate that the weight reduction will likely lower transportation and installation expenses.”
In the paper “Development of lightweight and flexible crystalline silicon solar cell modules with PET film cover for high reliability in high temperature and humidity conditions,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, the Japanese group explained that PET films represent a viable alternative to glass covers, due to their excellent electrical insulation and optical transmittance.
The scientists built the modules with 156 mm2 × 156 mm2 c-Si polycrystalline aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) structured solar cells with a thickness of approximately 250 μm. “The strings at the busbar were connected by machine soldering, and the strings of the four-cell modules were connected in series by hand soldering,” they noted.
They used a 0.025 mm-thick PET film for both the module's front cover and the backsheet and encapsulated the panels with ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA). “The module structure was PET/EVA/c-Si cell/EVA/PET or Backsheet,” they added.
The team compared the thermal behavior of the new module with that of a reference panel using a 3.2 mm-thick glass as the front-cover material and found the former exhibited greater flexibility than that fabricated using glass.
It also ascertained, however, that the module based on PET has a 10% lower current value, as the PET film, unlike the glass, has an anti-reflectance structure. The voltage and fill factor values were found to be approximately the same as those of the benchmark glass module. “The absence of a glass cover also imparts the fabricated modules with flexibility, and no cracks or other defects were observed after the modules were placed on and then removed from a measurement stage with a 200 mm radius of curvature,” it further explained.
The scientists emphasized the modules with a PET film cover also have the advantage of reduced weight, approximately “one-fourth per cell size”, which they said makes them ideal for installation in locations with loading restrictions.
They also tested the modules in a series of damp heat (DH) tests at 85 C and under 85% relative humidity and found that the glass-based panel showed degradation in the fill factor and current values after 3000 h because of corrosion of the silver (Ag) front electrodes. “By contrast, the lightweight modules (PET/Backsheet or PET/PET) showed only slightly diminished I–V properties, with about 10% degradation from the initial value after 6000 h of DH testing,” they stated.
The research group believes the PET-packaged modules with their impact-absorbing capacity may accelerate solar deployment in areas such as weight-limited factory roofs and agricultural applications.

Gestore dei Servizi Energetici (GSE), the Italian energy agency, has launched the country's 13th auction for renewable energy projects above 1 MW in size. It said the new procurement will consider current inflation levels.
“In application of Legislative Decree 57/2023 Urgent Measures for the Energy Sector, for the thirteenth renewable energy auction the tariff values will be updated by referring to the national consumer price index, to keep account of the cumulative average inflation from August 2019 to September 2023,” the agency stated.
Interested developers can submit project proposals from Oct. 18.
In the 12th renewables auction, which concluded in early October, the Italian authorities allocated 48 MW of installed solar power and 10 MW of wind capacity. Developers offered discounts ranging from 2% to 2.1% off the auction ceiling price of €0.065 ($0.068)/kWh. The lowest bid, at €0.0636/kWh, was for a 9.7 MW solar facility in the province of Campobasso, southern Italy.
The October issue of pv magazine, due out tomorrow, turns the spotlight back onto agrivoltaics. We’ll consider how solar on farmland is taking root in Australia and South Africa, how agrivoltaic data harvesting could help more farmers take the plunge, and how an insistence on expensive minimum heights for agrivoltaic panels is hindering the technology in Italy.
In the 11th procurement exercise, the GSE allocated 149 MW of solar capacity across 16 locations and five wind projects with a combined capacity of 213.8 MW. Developers submitted maximum discounts ranging from 2% to 2.8% off the auction ceiling price. These bids were slightly higher or equal to those in the 10th renewable energy auction and all previous actions.

NHPC has launched a tender to select developers to set up interstate transmission grid-connected renewables projects coupled with energy storage systems to supply 1.5 GW of firm, dispatchable renewables. The projects can be developed anywhere in India, on land identified and arranged by the developers. These are to be set up on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis.
NHPC will purchase the renewables generated by these projects and subsequently distribute them to state discoms or other beneficiaries through a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the chosen bidders. These projects fall under the open category, allowing the utilization of solar cells and modules from any source.
Developers can submit bids for a combined contracted capacity ranging from 50 MW to 750 MW, in increments of 10 MW, with a minimum project size of 50 MW. However, for projects situated in northeastern states and special category regions, a single developer can offer a minimum contracted capacity of 30 MW.
“Developers/generators who have already commissioned RE power plants or are in the process of constructing such plants and have untied capacity may also participate in the bid,” said the tender document. “Developers who have already set up capacity or who have spare untied capacity (that is unencumbered from any power supply commitments or power purchase agreements and is available for augmenting the proposed RE power under this RfS) may also participate in the bid.”

For the week of October 9, AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s wind energy production forecasts indicates that wind energy production will decrease in all analyzed markets.

Electricity demand
In the week of October 2, the evolution of electricity demand compared to the previous week did not show a common trend in the analyzed European markets. In some cases, demand increased compared to the previous week. The Spanish market registered the largest increase, 2.1%. It was followed by the British and French markets with corresponding increases of 0.7% and 0.2%. In the Belgian market, demand remained similar to that of the previous week. In the other analyzed markets, demand decreased. The largest declines – 2.2% and 2.0% – were registered in Germany and Portugal, respectively. During the week, both countries celebrated national holidays: Germany’s Unity Day on October 3 and Portugal’s Republic Day on October 5. Italy and the Netherlands registered smaller declines, 0.8% and 0.2%, respectively.
During the same period, average temperatures decreased between 1.6 °C—0.2 °C in most analyzed markets. The exception was Spain, where temperatures rose by 0.1 °C.
According to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s demand forecasts for the week of October 9, electricity demand is expected to increase in most analyzed European markets, with the exception of Spain, where the Spanish National Day will be celebrated on October 12.

European electricity markets
During the week of October 2, prices in most European electricity markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting decreased compared to the previous week. The exceptions were the IPEX market of Italy and the Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries, where the price increased by 3.9% and 43%, respectively. On the other hand, the EPEX SPOT market in Germany registered the largest decline, 30%. In the other markets, prices fell between 6.8% in the MIBEL market of Spain and 21% in the EPEX SPOT market of Belgium.
In the first week of October, weekly averages were below €85/MWh in most of the analyzed European electricity markets. The exceptions were the Spanish, Portuguese and Italian markets, where the averages were €105.23/MWh, €105.41/MWh and €120.79/MWh, respectively. On the other hand, the lowest average price, €5.45/MWh, was reached in the Nordic market. In the other analyzed markets, prices ranged from €74.20/MWh in the German market to €82.61/MWh in the Dutch market.
In terms of hourly prices, on October 3, negative prices were registered in the German, Belgian and French markets, while, on October 4—7, negative prices were registered in the Nordic market. The lowest hourly price, ‑€11.07/MWh, was reached in the German market on October 3, from 13:00 to 14:00. This was the lowest price in the German market since the first half of August.
On the other hand, in the first week of October, prices above €200/MWh were also registered in the German, Belgian, Italian and Dutch markets. The highest hourly price, €250.28/MWh, was reached in the German market on October 5, from 19:00 to 20:00. In addition, on Monday, October 9, hourly prices above €200/MWh were registered in the German, Belgian, French, Italian and Dutch markets. On that day, in the Spanish and Portuguese markets, from 20:00 to 21:00, a price of €184.50/MWh was reached, the highest price registered in these markets since March. In the N2EX market of the United Kingdom, on Monday, October 9, from 19:00 to 20:00, a price of £184.24/MWh was registered, the highest since August.
During the week of October 2, the decrease in the average price of gas and CO2, as well as the increase in wind energy production in most markets, led to lower prices in European electricity markets. However, in the Italian market, wind energy production decreased, contributing to the price increase in that market.
In the second week of October, prices might increase in most of the analyzed European electricity markets, influenced by the general decline in wind energy production and the increase in demand in most markets, AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s price forecasts indicate.

Brent, fuels and CO2
Brent oil futures for the Front‑Month in the ICE market reached the weekly maximum settlement price, $90.92/bbl, on Tuesday, October 3. This price was 3.2% lower than the previous Tuesday. Subsequently, prices decreased and in the last two sessions of the first week of October settlement prices remained below $85/bbl. The weekly minimum settlement price, $84.07/bbl, was registered on Thursday, October 5. This price was 12% lower than the previous Thursday and the lowest since August.
In the first week of October, concerns about the evolution of the global economy and demand exerted their downward influence on Brent oil futures prices. However, fears of supply problems related to growing instability in the Middle East might exert an upward influence on prices in the second week of October.
As for settlement prices of TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front‑Month, during the first week of October, they remained below €40/MWh. On Monday, October 2, the weekly maximum settlement price, €39.33/MWh, was reached. This price was 11% lower than the previous Monday. The weekly minimum settlement price, €36.21/MWh, was registered on October 5 and it was 8.9% lower than the previous Thursday. But on Friday prices increased again until registering a settlement price of €38.23/MWh, which was still 8.7% lower than the previous Friday.
The high level of European reserves and the forecast of mild temperatures contributed to prices being below €40/MWh during the first week of October – but the possibility of strikes at Australian liquefied natural gas export facilities led to the price increase registered at the end of the week.
CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2023 reached the weekly maximum settlement price, €81.67/t, on October 4. This price was 0.8% lower than the same day of the previous week. On the other hand, the weekly minimum settlement price, €79.65/t, was registered on Tuesday, October 3, and it was 4.0% lower than the previous Tuesday. This price was the lowest since the beginning of June.
The high level of renewable energy production reduced the demand for emission rights associated with fossil fuel electricity production. This had a downward impact on prices in the first week of October.
