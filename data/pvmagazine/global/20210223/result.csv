In 2020, around 12 GW of unsubsidized photovoltaic and wind power projects were announced in Europe, according to German consultancy Enervis.
Compared to 2019, there was a decrease of around 50% in PV projects and a 30% drop in offshore and onshore wind parks, according to the updated analysis document Status quo: Market Parity Report of PV and Wind Onshore in Europe.
According to the analyst, Spain remains the largest market for solar PPAs, with a project pipeline of 2.18 GW, which represents more than half of the announced subsidy-free photovoltaic projects in Europe. Germany and France are the second and third largest markets with 786 and 392 MW, respectively.
The main reason why the PPA market, which was just gaining momentum in Europe, was massively slowed down, at least temporarily, in 2020, was the coronavirus pandemic and its effects on the electricity markets. When the first lockdowns began, in March 2020, wholesale electricity prices plummeted, although they recovered over the course of the year. Across Europe, there was a decline of 25% over the course of the year. Furthermore, the gas price has fallen by a further 31%. After strong increases for CO2 certificates in 2018 and 2019, the Enervis analysts recorded a stagnation for these prices for 2020. As for the electricity futures, there were already signs of a significant recovery in December 2020, in some cases at a higher level than before the crisis.
Enervis also reported that capture prices for photovoltaics and wind power also fell drastically in the past year. In Germany, for example, the capture price of solar fell, on an annual average, to around €0.0246/kWh, while it was €0.043/kWh in 2018. These higher values make it difficult to secure a PPA as the projects are difficult to refinance through electricity sales. However, the analysts expect a short-term recovery in capture prices. However, the relative capture price of photovoltaics decreased significantly in 2020, which was also influenced by very low gas prices.
Enervis saw a significant, increasing presence of negative electricity prices in European countries. In Germany, these were reported 298 times within a year while, in the previous year, there had been 211 occurrences. In many other countries, there were negative electricity prices for the first time, in 2020. The main cause is strong electricity injection from renewable energy systems with a simultaneous sharp drop in demand as a result of the coronavirus lockdown. Negative electricity prices, on the other hand, have a dampening effect on the capture prices, as the plant operators cannot generate any income during these hours.
“An increasing number of European markets [have] the potential to achieve market parity in the next few years, despite temporarily lower capture prices due to the pandemic in 2020. Risks and opportunities of investing in a subsidy-free renewable energy project should be carefully analyzed,” said Enervis analyst Franziska Sicker.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/23/austrian-solar-industry-wants-covid-recovery-funds-spent-on-renewables-friendly-grid/,"COVID-19,FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRIA",MAX HALL,"FEBRUARY 23, 2021",Austrian solar industry wants Covid-recovery funds spent on renewables-friendly grid,"The Federal Association for Photovoltaics in Austria has called for €1 billion of the €3.3 billion Covid-recovery funding allotted the nation by the EU to be spent on expanding the grid to accommodate more solar power generation capacity.
The industry body has proposed half of the estimated €2 billion investment required to modernize the Austrian grid could come out of the European ‘recovery and resilience fund' (RRF) cash, with the balance to be raised from project and grid fees, according to an article published on the website of regional trade organization Solarpower Europe.
Under the terms of the three-year RRF budget, published by the EU last week, Austria can apply for a maximum €3.46 billion of non-repayable grant funding as long as it is accompanied by national investment and approved as part of Austria's recovery and resilience plan. The EU-wide €672.5 billion fund was said to have a maximum grant element of €312.5 billion, although the state-by-state breakdown published by the bloc totaled €338 billion, indicating the figure may have been adjusted for possible currency fluctuation from the 2018 euro values used in the headline plans.
Of the €3.3/3.46 billion potentially available to Austria, some 13%–€429/449.8 million–can be disbursed as soon as the national RRF plan is approved, from early next month. With 70% of the total–€2.31/2.42 billion–available to the end of 2022, the balance of €990 million/1.04 billion will be distributed the following year.
With the Bureau of Austrian Climate and Energy Funding having allocated €217 million for renewables expansion, decarbonizing industry and restructuring national energy and mobility systems this year, the solar industry is in no doubt about where spending priorities should lie.
Quoted on the Solarpower Europe website, Federal Association for Photovoltaics in Austria chairman Herbert Paierl said: “By using the EU recovery fund for the expansion of the Austrian electricity grids, the expansion of solar will not only provide safe, environmentally friendly and sustainable electricity but electricity that is also transparent and cost-effective. In addition, tens of thousands of domestic jobs will be created and domestic value creation is promoted. I am sure that this proposal will be supported by respective social partners and federal provinces.”
The RRF rules dictate at least 37% of spending be devoted to climate objectives and 20% to digital transformation–both of which could encompass grid infrastructure upgrades; and stipulates no projects backed by the scheme should cause significant harm to the bloc's environmental aims.

The JV, called Lijiang Silicon Co Ltd, was established in late 2016. Longi will now take over full ownership. Tongwei and Trina Solar had held shares of 15% and 25%, respectively. The joint venture was set up for monocrystalline wafer production and had an annual manufacturing capacity of 5 GW. The six board members appointed by Tongwei and Trina have withdrawn from the board.
China's largest PV manufacturer, Jinksolar, has placed a long-term solar glass order with compatriot Flat Glass. Under the three-year contract, Flat Glass will provide the panel maker with around 338 million square meters of photovoltaic glass, enough to produce around 59 GW of solar modules. Jinko defined the deal as another important strategic cooperation in the supply chain, after a recent arrangement with Chinese manufacturer Tongwei to buy 93,000 metric tons of polysilicon.
The Shanghai Electric Guoxuan New Energy Technology Co battery manufacturing joint venture established by state-owned power company Shanghai Electric and EV battery maker Gotion High-Tech today announced it has signed a memorandum of understanding with British renewables company Pacific Green Technologies Inc. The arrangement will draw on Shanghai Guoxuan's manufacturing and London-based Pacific Green's global storage project procurement and development nous. Shanghai Guoxuan in September opened the RMB1.5 billion (US$232 million), 5 GWh annual production capacity first phase of a planned RMB3 billion, 10 GWh Nantong lithium battery industry base.
Heterojunction (HJT) equipment supplier Shenzhen S.C yesterday announced it hopes to raise up to RMB2.5 billion through a shares issue. The company intends to use RMB1 billion to build a new factory for chemical vapor deposition equipment. That factory should have the capacity to produce equipment that could manufacture 20 GW of HJT modules annually. The remaining RMB1.5 billion would be used for purposes such as the purchase of equipment or software.
Energy company China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) has announced its renewables targets for the next five years. In its proposal for the nation's 14th five-year plan, the company said it will invest in hydrogen and distributed PV. The company expects to build 10,000 hydrogen plants and 7,000 distributed solar PV stations over five years. Most of the plants will likely be located at its Chinese oil and gas fields.
GCL-Poly solar project business GCL New Energy on Friday raised a net HK$895 million (US$115 million) by placing 2 billion shares at HK$0.455 (US$0.06) per share. The stock represents 9.49% of the equity of the enlarged company with the developer to use the funds to pay down debt.
This copy was amended on 24/02/21 to indicate GCL New Energy raised cash by issuing 2 billion shares, rather than 2 million, as previously indicated.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/23/work-begins-on-underground-hydrogen-storage-project-in-germany/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,GERMANY",RALPH DIERMANN,"FEBRUARY 23, 2021",Work begins on underground hydrogen storage project in Germany,"From pv magazine Germany
German energy provider EWE has started the construction of a cavern for hydrogen storage in Rüdersdorf, near Berlin.
The cavern storage facility will have a capacity of 500 cubic meters, which corresponds to the volume of a single-family house. The company is working with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) on this project.
The DLR Institute for Networked Energy Systems will examine, among other things, the quality of the hydrogen during storage and after it has been extracted from the cavern.
In the first stage of the project, EWE will build a derrick on an existing borehole and this work is expected to take a week. The utility will then install and cement a steel pipe from the surface to a depth of 1,000 meters by the beginning of April. This will connect the pilot cavern with the earth's surface.  
“In the context of the research project, we particularly hope to gain knowledge of the degree of purity of the hydrogen after it has been withdrawn from the cavern,” said EWE project manager Hayo Seeba. This factor is crucial for the use of hydrogen in the mobility sector.
The knowledge that the small pilot cavern will provide should be easily transferable to caverns with a volume that is 1,000 times higher, the company went on to say. The aim is to use caverns with a volume of 500,000 cubic meters for large scale hydrogen storage in the future.
EWE owns 37 salt caverns that represent 15% of all German cavern storage facilities that could be suitable for storing hydrogen in the future. “This would mean that large quantities of green hydrogen generated from renewable energies could be stored and used as required and would become an indispensable component in order to achieve set climate targets,” Seeba added. 
Scientists at Germany’s Jülich Institute for Energy and Climate Research (IEK-3) recently revealed that Europe has the potential to inject hydrogen in bedded salt deposits and salt domes with a total energy storage capacity of 84.8 PWh. Most of these salt caverns are concentrated in northern Europe, at offshore and onshore locations. Germany accounts for the largest share, followed by the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, and Poland. Other potential sites are in Romania, France, Spain, and Portugal.
“Germany has the highest storage potential in both onshore and offshore contexts,” the group said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/23/bloombergnef-expects-up-to-209-gw-of-new-solar-for-this-year/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 23, 2021",BloombergNEF expects up to 209 GW of new solar for this year,"BloombergNEF has forecast that 2021 may become a record year for PV with over 200 GW of newly installed PV capacity.
In the latest 1Q 2021 Global PV Market Outlook, the analyst expects new PV additions for this year will range from 160 to 209 GW. For comparison, in 2020 and 2019, newly deployed solar had reached 135 and 118 GW, respectively.
Looking forward, BloombergNEF provides a conservative scenario and an optimistic one. Under the first scenario, new grid-connected PV systems are expected to total 160 GW this year and 163 and 179 MW in 2022 and 2023, respectively.
Under the second scenario, new PV additions are predicted to reach 209 GW this year and 221 and 240 GW in the following two years, respectively.
BloombergNEF analysts believe that supply bottlenecks for glass and polysilicon will not hold the market back. “Most country solar markets will grow in 2021, particularly India, which has a large number of projects delayed from 2020, and China, which is expected to maintain growth to keep course for its 2060 net-zero target,” BloombergNEF explained.
BloombergNEF analysts believe that supply bottlenecks for glass and polysilicon will not hold the market back as new capacities for both products are gradually coming online to meet strong demand. “Along with expected new glass capacity, there should be adequate supply as new factories for glass and polysilicon come online, although polysilicon will be the bottleneck and prices will probably stabilize around $12/kg this year,” the analyst said. “There is plenty of module capacity and we expect prices to drop to about $0.19/W for standard modules, based on 166mm wafers, with larger-format modules commanding a premium in markets without punitive trade tariffs.”
A few weeks earlier, BloombergNEF chief analyst Jenny Chase had forecast that the world could add 151-194 GW of new solar generation capacity this year. The analyst also predicted a recovery of the supply of glass needed for solar panels would see average module prices fall a further $0.02/W, to $0.18/W, this year.

With Covid-19 having reduced energy demand in the kingdom, the Middle Eastern state is hampered by grid problems of an unusual kind as its electricity network already hosts too much generation capacity, according to the Renewables Readiness Assessment for The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan produced in association with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.
The authorities in Amman prioritized energy independence in a national energy strategy drawn up in June in a kingdom which relied on imports to meet 92% of its energy demand in 2018, at an estimated cost of around 10% of GDP.
The National Energy Strategy for 2020-2030 aims for the 20% of Jordan's electricity generation met by renewables at present to reach 21% this year and 31% by 2030 when, it is hoped, clean power will contribute 14% of the overall energy mix, up from 8% in 2018.
IRENA lauds the swift progress made on renewable energy to date in Jordan, which went from contributing just 0.7% of the energy mix in 2014 to 13% five years later, but the challenge facing the industry is illustrated by the fact the kingdom's desire to reduce imports has prompted the government to start work on the nation's first, 30 MW coal-fired power station and to explore the exploitation of domestic shale oil deposits.
Most of the recommendations made by the report–which cites four pv magazine correspondents–come back to the need to modernize and upgrade the grid at the same time as driving electrification of new sectors to ramp up energy demand.
The study also frequently harks back to the decision by the government, in January 2019, to halt the development of new renewables projects with a generation capacity of 1 MW or more. As reported by pv magazine in March, the authorities also temporarily disconnected all unsubsidized renewables projects which used the grid to transmit electricity generated at remote sites to private consumers. Those ‘wheeling' projects had their connections restored between March and May, the report added.
The IRENA document calls for the resumption of ‘direct proposal' renewable energy auctions, which involve developers suggesting projects to the authorities, who then award them after competitive electricity-tariff bidding. The last such exercise was staged in 2018. The inclusion of energy storage requirements in such procurement rounds could ease grid concerns, suggested IRENA.
Programs to expand solar rooftop installation in energy-poor neighborhoods, and on public buildings should be more ambitious, advises the study. The development by the authorities of dedicated renewables sites for wheeling clients could open up clean power for more private energy consumers as land acquisition and grid connection are hurdles which currently have to be negotiated by developers, restricting corporate solar to the entities with the deepest pockets.
The thorny question of energy demand prompted the report's authors to emphasize the need to formulate policy to encourage the electrification of heating and lighting, industry, and transport, and to explore energy carriers such as green hydrogen for hard-to-electrify industry. Another way of driving energy demand would be to expand regional agreements with neighboring Egypt, Palestine, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, according to the study.
The report concludes with the perennial business call for permitting to be simplified as well as an indication more domestic financiers should enter the renewables marketplace in a nation where 75% of clean energy backing comes from beyond its borders. It is suggested multilateral development lenders could help in that respect, with the provision of joint financing and of capital to de-risk investment.

The VI Series, which will also be available in the global PV market, features three different panels with a power output of 470, 475, and 480 W and a power conversion efficiency ranging from 20.1 to 20.5%.
The smallest device of the series, called the HiE-S470VI, has an open-circuit voltage of 46.4 V and a short-circuit current of 13.04 A. The biggest panel, dubbed HiE-S480VI, features an open-circuit voltage of 46.4 V and a short-circuit current of 13.16 A. The maximum system voltage for all products is 1,500 V.
The 72-cell panels measure 2,056×1,140×35mm and weigh 25kg. The panels can be used with operating temperatures of between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.34% per degree Celsius. They come with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee for the European and Australian markets.
The panels are encapsulated with ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and feature an MC4-compatible connector, 3.2mm white toughened safety glass, and an anodized aluminum frame.
“Hyundai shingled module technology has superior performance of efficiency and power and has a better mechanical-withstand performance compared to regular PV modules … by using electrically conductive adhesive (ECA) instead of soldering ribbon, which enables the maximum utilization of module space,” the manufacturer said.
The company specified that it also offers shingled modules through the 60-cell VG Series, which features products with a power output of 390 to 405 W and efficiency ranging from 19.9 to 20.7%. These products also come with a 25-year product guarantee. “As a core business entity of the large Hyundai group, the 25-year product warranty is a clear sign of Hyundai’s quality commitment and an ambition to become a reference player in the European and Australian residential and commercial self-consumption market,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
*The article was amended to reflect that the modules may have a power output guarantee of 25 years, and not 20/25 years.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/23/rising-prices-may-push-pv-industry-to-move-away-from-silver-use/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 23, 2021",Rising prices may push PV industry away from silver,"Silver scarcity need not trouble the PV industry, according to the authors of a paper on the topic, as long as efforts to reduce the metal's content in solar panels continue apace.
“The majority of them had the feeling this would not become an issue in the future,” University of Reading researcher Samuele Lo Piano told pv magazine.
Academics from Reading University, in the U.K., as well as Spain's Universitat Oberta de Catalunya and the University of Bergen, in Norway, compiled estimates of projected silver use trends from peers and several industry experts for the research. “We have tried to build scenarios on the basis of the quantitative estimates they provided us with,” added Lo Piano.
Asked how silver prices which are currently on the rise may have an impact on the PV industry, Lo Piano conceded they can be a good proxy during relative scarcity. “They cannot be considered, however, good proxies in a regime of absolute scarcity where the biophysical limits of an available commodity are close to being reached,” he explained. “In those settings … any market mechanism is bound to fail.”

Market agents can effectively intervene by triggering further efforts in exploration and technological solutions in an under-supply regime characterized by higher prices, he added. In these settings, companies would be motivated to improve the recovery conditions as well as to explore fields previously considered non-economically viable. “Conversely, any excess in supply would drive the opposite mechanism by lowering the commodity price and with it mining companies' efforts toward the exploration of new areas,” he stated. “However, market mechanisms are ineffective to perform any balancing function when the absolute physical limits are approaching.”
Lo Piano also explained that, when accounting for the possible overshooting of silver natural budget, the price of silver would act as a mere oscillatory mechanism alongside the overall trajectory toward the limit.
In the study, which was published in Frontiers Energy Research, Lo Piano and his fellow scientists stressed that most of the experts that participated in their survey agreed on the fact that, if a sudden rise in silver prices materializes, the industry could rapidly implement options to completely move away from silver use. “However, the pending issue remains at what pace this could take place,” the research group stated, adding that only one expert was convinced that silver availability may represent an issue for future PV deployment.
The paper highlighted that important research such as the 2011 version of the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic (ITRPV) had forecast that silver would be completely replaced by copper in 2015. “However, this goal has been systematically moved forward in time and technological developments do not seem to promise a rapid and full silver replacement,” the report notes. During the past decade, the PV industry has reduced silver use but only for the rear contact of the cells with partial substitution with aluminum, and for the front side silver remains an unsolved issue, although copper-nickel alloys for the frontal contact metallization are considered a promising solution.
“Some of the engaged academics and experts from the industry that produced a quantitative estimate in the context of the study endorsed the estimates elaborated in the ITRPV,” Lo Piano explained. “Others assessed that silver would not be required anymore for the contact metallization of PV cells by the year 2050, or for a maximum of 20 mg silver per cell maximum.” The group of scientists quantified the yearly decrease in silver use for contact metalization in the range of 4 to 7%.
The authors of the study calculated the amount of yearly silver demand for the PV industry with a theoretical model that considered the amount of silver needed for silver pastes, the total production capacity of crystalline silicon modules, the increase in efficiency in crystalline solar cells, and silver demand in non-PV applications.
The 49 experts that participated in the study, which included 30 PV contact-metallization experts, 15 energy international agencies, and four silver-related consultancies, were asked to provide an estimation for the three parameters in the year 2050 and the speed at which future advances in solar cell metallization would be achieved.
“Several of the parameters have been randomized: rather than producing a single deterministic value, a range of possibilities has been evaluated,” the scientists explained. “To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time this type of approach is carried out in the assessment of the potentiality of silver constraint to a large scale solar photovoltaics development.”
The analysis conducted with the model suggests that the use of silver in the solar industry should proceed at a “meaningful pace,” if ambitious PV deployments targets need to be reached.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/02/23/new-eu-battery-rules-support-a-sustainable-energy-industry/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,EUROPE",,"FEBRUARY 23, 2021",New EU battery rules support a sustainable energy industry,"From pv magazine 02/2021
The European Commission proposal 2020/353 (Batteries Regulation) is more than 100 pages long and comprises 79 articles, 14 annexes, and about 30 pieces of secondary legislation. As one of the first product-specific legislative proposals under Ursula von der Leyen, the Batteries Regulation is a key element in the implementation of the European Green Deal.
The EU classifies batteries as a strategic value chain and puts them at the core of its economic and technological leadership initiatives. With the goal of establishing a competitive ecosystem based on innovative and sustainable batteries made in Europe, the continent’s Strategic Action Plan on Batteries already foresaw in 2017 a new legislative setting designed to “ensure consistency with the EU’s broader enabling and regulatory framework.”
Industry and policymakers must now ask whether the proposed Batteries Regulation can deliver on its core promises.
Europe accounts for approximately 5% of global battery cell manufacturing capacity, and most material extraction and refining work is done outside of the EU single market. Against that backdrop, the industry welcomes the transformation of the current Batteries Directive into a Europe-wide regulation as an important step toward consistency and predictability.
In the past, national or regional interpretations have often resulted in additional administrative and financial burdens. At Recharge, we especially applaud the regulation’s explicit objective to create more coherence with other regulatory frameworks, such as the Waste Shipment Regulation. Regrettably, the commission proposal has fallen short on a coherent approach with other existing frameworks, such as the UN transport and safety testing regulation and European horizontal legislation such as REACH and the Sustainable Corporate Governance initiative.
As one of the first products regulated on a lifecycle basis, batteries and their components were already subject to comprehensive legislation, from product safety to transport and waste management. The new degree of complexity of the proposed Batteries Regulation therefore risks overregulating a particularly fast-paced, innovative battery industry.
Battery value chain participants note that overlapping measures exist within the regulation, such as multiple, incoherent information, declaration and labelling requirements, as well as a general level of excessive ambition.
To ensure that the new EU batteries framework does not make the best the enemy of the good, it will be important now to carefully specify the technical details to relevant articles in the upcoming secondary legislative process. Equally important will be a timely, yet robust implementation. Some of the secondary legislation time frames pose a true challenge to compliance with the legislative base here.
By better reflecting today’s technology spectrum and market developments, the commission proposal generally makes an important step forward. It puts batteries for electric mobility and stationary energy storage at its core and recognizes the strategic role of batteries for the achievement of the European Green Deal.
Nonetheless, a number of provisions are too stringent or technology-specific to easily enable important technological developments. New design, performance and durability requirements risk preventing real breakthroughs in battery-application optimization and efficiency improvement. At times, the Batteries Regulation does not sufficiently reflect technology/product specifics that are linked to electro chemistry or safety. These shortcomings are expected to make it more difficult for the European industry to develop and innovate within the existing market structure.
If correctly implemented, Article 7 and Article 39 could prove to be real game changers. Introducing a carbon footprint threshold as well as environmental and social due diligence requirements, the commission proposal sent a clear sign for a needed paradigm shift. Due diligence and carbon intensity had clearly been missing in the comprehensive framework regulating batteries so far.
Batteries for electric vehicles and stationary energy storage, among other applications, will now have to show their carbon footprint and eventually comply with a maximum carbon threshold. In combination with the upcoming battery passport, the carbon intensity measure will not only prevent underperforming batteries from entering the EU market, but will also incentivize best-in-class manufacturers.
Equally important is the upcoming obligation for economic operators to establish corporate supply chain due diligence policies. Recharge and our members especially welcome that this measure covers social, labor and human rights issues, as well as key environmental risks. That it is limited to the raw materials sector is unfortunate.
The commission’s proposal for a Batteries Regulation is an important milestone in delivering on the Strategic Action Plan on Batteries. It closes existing gaps, incorporates relevant updates, and paves the way for sustainable industry development. The true test of the effectiveness of the new rules will come in 2022, when the regulation is expected to enter into force. Until then, policymakers and industry actors will have to continue to work together to establish a robust, meaningful, and viable legislative framework that can meet the needs of an increasingly electrified world.

Including its own tracker business, Trina has listed China's Archtech and US providers Array Technologies, Gamechange Solar and Nextracker, Germany”s Ideematec, and Spanish manufacturers Soltec and PV Hardware.
“The tracker and module compatibility approvals from these global leaders in the tracker field demonstrate their recognition of the 210 modules’ high value and strong support in terms of comprehensive collaboration to facilitate the grid parity globally,” Trina said in a statement. “On the other hand, the compatibility with ultra-high power modules will also raise the tracker’s system value and contributes to reducing costs in various scenarios.”
The company also defined the achieved compatibility of trackers as another industry-wide strategic move that advances the application of 210 ultra-high-power module products on the system side.
The list of all inverter manufacturers that are now making devices compatible with 210mm panels included Chinese conglomerate Huawei, Chinese manufacturers Sineng Electric and Sungrow, Germany-based SMA and other producers such as GoodWe, Ginlong and Kstar.
Trina Solar began producing its first modules relying on 210mm wafers in January 2020. In July, it also launched, together with Risen Energy and JA Solar, the 600W+ Photovoltaic Open Innovation Ecological Alliance, which aimed to cross the 600 W module output threshold.

A new report by JMK Research says India could install about 9.7 GW of new utility-scale solar capacity in 2021, of which around 5.7 GW would likely be grid-connected in the ﬁrst half of the year.
The forecast for the six first months of 2021 is based on about 4.5 GW of central and string inverter shipments and 3 GW of modules shipment to India in the last quarter of 2020, the market research company said.
Rooftop solar additions in 2021 are expected to reach 2 GW, which would compare to 1.17 GW in 2020.
According to the report, the nation’s new utility-scale solar capacity for the year 2020 stood at just about 2.6 GW, 65% less than the installed capacity deployed in 2019. 
Gujarat was the Indian state with the largest share in new additions in the rooftop segment with 496 MW, followed by Rajasthan (180 MW) and Tamil Nadu (154 MW).

As the Ranger Uranium Mine continues its decommissioning, the Northern Territory Labor Government’s Master Plan for revitalizing the former mining town of Jabiru in the heart of Kakadu National Park is gathering pace with the announcement that the local subsidiary of German renewable energy specialist juwi AG will construct a solar farm as part of global energy producer Energy Developments Limited’s (EDL’s) solar-diesel hybrid power station.
“Hybrid power solutions offer the potential to significantly reduce the amount of fossil fuel power generation within the Kakadu National Park, said Dave Manning, juwi’s Global Head of Hybrid in a statement on Friday.
Renewable energy offers a power source more suited to both the aspirations of the local Indigenous community to develop the town as a culturally appropriate center for tourism, and the commitment of the NT Government to attain 50% power generation from renewables by 2030.
Jabiru’s new hybrid power system consists of 3.9 MW of solar, a 3 MW/5MWh battery, and 4.5 MW diesel capability, and will deliver at least 50% renewable generation to the township.
The integrated hybrid plant will be owned and operated by EDL, and construction is scheduled to commence shortly, with the expectation that the diesel power station will be up and running by the end of this year, and the solar farm and battery will exert their green influence by early 2022.
In December 2020, the NT Government paved the way for the town’s electricity network to receive and distribute energy from the new plant, with $10 million worth of upgrades as part of a $135.5 million investment in Jabiru, which it said at the time was “pivotal” in establishing the township as a “vibrant cultural center” of the West Arnhem region.
“Jabiru has the potential to be a real drawcard for Territorians and visitors alike,” said Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner, who added that his government’s “ongoing investment in critical services and infrastructure is helping the township get there, to ensure it prospers sustainably for years to come.”
For juwi, this is its sixth project either delivered or under construction in Australia, and builds on the early success of its landmark DeGrussa project, a 10.6 MW solar array, plus 6 MWh battery, integrated with existing diesel generation to supply Sandfire’s copper and gold mine site in Western Australia. It became fully operational in 2016, and at the time was the world’s largest diesel-solar hybrid system, and the largest off-grid PV system in Australia.
Juwi has become a specialist in developing hybrid power plants for non-grid-connected industries such as mining, using its juwi Hybrid IQ software to intelligently integrate system components into existing islanded networks.
