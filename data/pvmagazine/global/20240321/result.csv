The authorities will initially allocate 300,000 hectares to be divided into lots of 10,000 to 30,000 hectares, depending on the size of the planned projects.
The government said it will assign the land to private investors and will track the development of the projects. It has reportedly received several expressions of interest from around 100 national and international investors. The first preliminary contracts could be signed by the third quarter of 2024, it said.
In an interview with the Medi1 television channel, Laila Benali, the minister of energy transition, noted the importance of private investments for the country, which needs to triple its annual investments in renewable energy and multiply its investments by five.
Benali said that Office Chérifien des Phosphates (OCP) recently launched an investment plan of MAD 130 billion ($14.2 billion) to manufacture green fertilizer, launch renewable energy production, and develop seawater desalination projects.
Morocco wants to position itself as a global exporter of renewable hydrogen. Its domestic energy demand is estimated at around 4 TWh/year by 2030. Due to its proximity to Europe, it wants to position itself as a preferred supplier to the European Union, which could import 10 million tons of hydrogen by 2030.

German car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz has ordered an Organic SolidFlow storage system from Germany-based provider CMBlu Energy.
The automaker said it will use the 11 MWh storage system for its factory in Rastatt, Germany. The project will be implemented in the second half of 2025.
The battery will temporarily store solar power from PV systems installed at the factory. It reportedly does not require critical raw materials and is almost completely recyclable, according to the manufacturer. 
The system is based on high-performance organic energy storage molecules. The material used is lignin, which can be sourced as a by-product from pulp mills. It is filled into two separate tanks and combined for a biochemical reaction in a special unit.
The material is organic, non-flammable, non-explosive, and can live through more than 10,000 charging cycles. The flow battery system has a multi-cell stack design and is only really suitable for stationary storage applications, but it is easily scalable to the gigawatt level.
Mercedes-Benz is currently expanding its renewable energy capacity.
“The integration of energy storage into our production system, which is increasingly powered by renewable energies, is an important factor,” said Jörg Burzer, a management board member at Mercedes-Benz Group AG. “With CMBlu’s organic solid flow technology, we are pursuing innovative approach.”

It claimed it is the largest energy storage system to be installed in Latin America.
The storage facility is connected to the 181.2 MW Coya PV plant, in Maira Elena, in northern Chile's Antofagasta region, which has one of the world's highest levels of solar radiation. Engie announced the project in December 2022.
The installation consists of 232 containers that are distributed evenly among the 58 inverters of the solar plant. It is equivalent to the average delivery of 200 GWh per year.
“After the entry into commercial operation of BESS Coya, we now have 640 MWh of storage capacity in the country,” said Juan Villavicencio, managing director renewables for Engie Chile. “We will add two more projects that are currently under construction: BESS Tamaya (68 MW/418 MWh) and BESS Capricornio (48 MW/264 MWh). That will translate into around 255 MW of power for 5 hours of energy discharge mainly at night.”
Chinese manufacturer Sungrow supplied batteries for the project. The storage systems are based on the company's PowerTitan liquid cooling energy storage technology.
The Coya solar plant began operating in April 2023. Engie currently operates another storage system in Arica, Chile. The system, which was commissioned in 2019, is based on lithium-ion batteries and has a capacity of 2 MWh.

They claim that it is Europe’s largest BESS to date.
Work began in September 2021 on the Clay Tye site in Essex, England. It has a total capacity of 99 MW/198 MWh – enough power to supply energy to more than 300,000 UK homes for a period of two hours.
The facility features 52 Tesla Megapack lithium-ion batteries that are connected to the UK Power Networks distribution network, allowing the batteries to store energy from renewable sources and provide on-peak flexibility to the UK national grid.
“[The site] will contribute to future energy security, make energy bills more affordable, while supporting the decarbonisation of the grid,” said Harmony Energy CEO Peter Kavanagh.
The Clay Tye facility follows two other BESS projects that FRV and Harmony Energy have completed in the United Kingdom – the 34 MW/68 MWh Contego project and the 7.5 MW/15 MWh Holes Bay installation.
FRV and Harmony Energy say their joint projects support the United Kingdom’s energy security goals and efforts to decarbonize. According to the UK government’s net zero initiative, England, Scotland, and Wales aim to decarbonize their electricity systems by 2035. Northern Ireland wants 80% of its electricity supply to be renewable by 2030.
In November 2022, Harmony Energy switched on a 98 MW/196 MWh storage system near Hull, East Yorkshire, in collaboration with Tesla.
Earlier this month, NatPower UK said it plans to invest more than GBP 10 billion ($12.7 billion) in the United Kingdom’s green energy market, including the nationwide deployment of battery energy storage projects.

India’s cumulative solar waste will reach about 19,000 kt by 2050, as all the capacity deployed until 2030 will have reached end of life, according to a new study by the CEEW. The organization estimates India-specific solar waste generation from various streams, excluding manufacturing.
The report states while the modules are designed for a 25-year life, some have an early end of life due to factors such as damage during transportation, module handling, and project operations.
According to the report, India’s installed 66.7 GW of capacity, as of fiscal 2023, has generated about 100 kt of waste, but that will increase to 340 kt by 2030. The 340 kt of waste is expected to include about 10 kt of silicon, 12 kt to 18 kt of silver, and 16 tons of cadmium and tellurium. Around 67% of the 340 kt of solar waste will be generated in five states: Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.
The cumulative solar waste from existing and new PV capacity deployed between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2030 will reach about 600 kt, equivalent to filling up 720 Olympic-size swimming pools.
The study authors assumed that India’s installed PV capacity will reach about 292 GW by 2030. India will need about 1,700 GW of solar capacity by 2050 and 5,600 GW by 2070 to achieve its 2070 net-zero target.
The study authors said that mounting solar waste presents an opportunity for India to emerge as a leading circular economy hub for the solar industry.
India is already implementing several measures to tackle the waste. Last year, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) issued E-waste Management Rules 2022 that will govern the management of solar cells and modules waste in India. These rules mandate the producers of solar cells and modules to manage their waste under the extended producer responsibility (EPR) framework.
“India must proactively address solar waste, not just as an environmental imperative but as a strategic necessity for ensuring energy security and building a circular economy,” said Arunabha Ghosh, the CEO of CEEW. “As we witness the remarkable growth of solar from only 4 GW in March 2015 to 73 GW in December 2023, robust recycling mechanisms become increasingly crucial. They safeguard renewable ecosystems, create green jobs, enhance mineral security, foster innovation, and build resilient, circular supply chains.”
The CEEW said that the Indian solar industry should prepare for new responsibilities by arranging reverse logistics, storage, dismantling centres, and recycling facilities. The industry should also explore innovative financing mechanisms and business models for solar waste management, it said.

The CfD auction, first announced last year, has a total capacity of 5,000 MW split across two auctions. The first 2,000 MW exercise is expected in the coming weeks, while a 3,000 MW auction is expected in 2025. The auctions will be equally split between solar and onshore wind, with project capacities expected to be between 5 MW and 200 MW. 
The duration of the CfD agreement will be 15 years from the date of commercial operation. The European Commission approved the project earlier this month with a €3 billion funding package through its Modernization Fund.
Romania’s Ministry of Energy recently updated the draft of its CfD agreement. While many principles remain in line with those previously announced, a key change is that now CfD beneficiaries will have to sell all electricity on centralised markets.
Mihaela Nyerges, managing partner at law firm Nyerges & Partners, told pv magazine the strike price is a “good maximum,” but said aspects of the legislation remain “red flags” that could significantly affect the bankability of the scheme.
“One is that the CfD counterparty has no liability to producers if CfD payments are not made due to CfD fund illiquidity allocated to the respective CfD agreement,”  Nyerges said. “Moreover, the beneficiary is not allowed to set-off future payments due to CfD Counterparty with those outstanding from the latter.”
Elsewhere, a decision to give the CfD counterparty the right to terminate the agreement for convenience “significantly contravenes the stability of the scheme, which is essential for ensuring its bankability,” Nyerges said.
She explained that termination compensation would be calculated on historical reference prices, which “may not be a fair representation of CfD payments that would have been gained by producers had the termination not occurred.”
CfD beneficiaries will not receive CfD payment for time intervals with negative prices, which Nyerges said is a “concern from the perspective of cash-predictability.” However, she added that the approach mirrors the UK system, “which was used as a source of inspiration.” 
Romania’s Ministry of Energy is accepting feedback on its draft until March 25, after which it is expected to publish the final version along with the Auction Initiation Order, which will give more details on auction requirements and the full eligibility criteria. Nyerges said she expects the auction to be launched in the next couple of weeks.
The Romanian government increased its renewables targets toward the end of 2023. Its current plan stands at 36% of the nation's energy to come from renewables by 2030, with 8.3 GW of solar and 7.6 GW of wind, while it plans to phase out coal by 2032. The country hit 2.9 GW of solar capacity at the end of 2023.

Cells built with quantum dots are known for showing high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields, due to strong defect tolerance, and high open-circuit voltages.
Quantum dots are tiny particles of semiconductors that can carry a charge and can be made from various materials. They have been investigated as possible solar cell materials for a long time. Those based on perovskites have proved particularly attractive to researchers working in photovoltaics, having already demonstrated efficiencies beyond 16%.
The Korean scientists said the advantage of CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots consists of their ability to be easily deposited on any substrate at desired nanoscale thicknesses using a layer-by-layer (LBL) method at room temperature. “Such a facile and low-temperature process facilitates the fabrication of devices even on lightweight and flexible polymer-based substrates,” they explained.
Another important feature of the cell is represented by its electron transport layer (ETL), which was fabricated with room-temperature-processed tin oxide (SnO2) and is intended to improve photovoltaic performance through energy level control, while minimizing damage to the polymer substrate through the low-temperature process. “The energy level of SnO2 is controlled by doping gallium ions to reduce the energy level mismatch with the perovskite quantum dots,” the academics said.
The group built the cell with a substrate made of indium tin oxide (ITO), the ETL based on SnO2, the CsPbI3-QD absorber, a hole transport layer (HTL) based on Spiro-OMeTAD, and a gold (Au) metal contact.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of f 12.70%, which the scientists said is the highest ever reported for all types of flexible quantum dot solar cells to date. They found the cell was also able to retain around 94% of its initial efficiency after 500 bending tests.
“CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot films are expected to provide better mechanical stability than bulk perovskite films owing to their nanoscale grain boundaries and soft surface ligands, thus underscoring their potential as flexible device components,” they further explained.
The new solar cell was introduced in the study “Completely annealing-free flexible Perovskite quantum dot solar cells employing UV-sintered Ga-doped SnO2 electron transport layers,” published in npj flexible electronics. The research group was formed by scientists from Hanyang University and Kookmin University in South Korea.

The ASTRO N7s ZBB-TF panel is fabricated without busbars, based on zero busbar (ZBB) interconnection technology.
“Astronergy is one of the first companies in the industry to apply ZBB technology to the TOPCon technology route and achieve mass production,” Astronergy's product marketing executive Peter Li, told pv magazine.“By applying ZBB technology, there are no main grid lines and no pad points on the front and back of the cell, which effectively reduces 20% of the amount of silver paste compared to super multibusbar (SMBB) processes, which improves the aesthetics.”
According to Li, the usage of more and finer welding wires makes the stress distribution more uniform and mitigates the risk of hidden cracks in the process.
“The ZBB technology is known for its ability to increase conversion efficiency by eliminating shading caused by busbars,” TÜV Rheinland’s Christos Monokroussos told pv magazine. It supports better current carrier collection efficiency and improved aesthetics.
The module also integrates a tiling film (TF), which is used to hold solder strips and solar cells in place during the subsequent lamination process. It protects the overlapping area of adjacent cells, reducing the chances of cracking, according to the manufacturer.
The bifacial ASTRO N7s ZBB-TF modules feature 108 n-type TOPCon cells. The modules also feature front and back glass with a thickness of 1.6 mm and a black anodized aluminum frame. They measure 1,762 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh 21.5 kg.
The new panels are available in five versions with power outputs ranging from 440 W to 460 W. The power conversion efficiency spans from 22.0% to 23.0%. The open-circuit voltage is between 38.80 V and 39.60 A, while the short-circuit current is between 14.18 A and 14.52 A.
The products operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and have an IP68 junction box. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.29% per C.
The manufacturer offers a 30-year linear power output warranty, a 15-year product warranty, and an optional 25-year warranty for rooftop applications. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1% and the 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
TÜV Rheinland has certified the panels.
The shipment news signals mass production for a model with a reported efficiency of 23%, suitable for residential and distributed generation markets.
For now, the modules featuring the ZBB and TF technologies are only available for residential applications, according to Li. The company, however, may consider bringing them to the commercial and industrial (C&I) markets if demand emerges.

New hybrid energy technology combines Schneider Electric’s EcoStruxure Microgrid Solution and the design-build services offered by Mainspring’s Linear Generator. The result is a fuel-flexible solution for commercial and industrial customers looking to decarbonize.
A microgrid is a self-contained electrical network that generates electricity on site by a fuel source such as solar and stored for when it is needed most. The microgrid can be connected to the power grid or can decentralize and “island” when needed. The ability to decentralize power ensures that critical facilities, such as data centers or healthcare facilities, have electricity to power critical operations and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They can also be used in remote areas where energy access is limited or nonexistent to provide much-needed resources.
As part of Schneider Electric’s cybersecure solution architecture, EcoStruxure Microgrid Operations is a dedicated, packaged microgrid controller solution. The hardware and software solution offers streamlined operator experience, advanced distributed energy resource management, advanced grid management, and more, according to Schneider Electric.
The Mainspring Linear Generator was launched commercially in 2020 and the company reports it is installed today in multiple regions of the U.S., running operations for Fortune 500 companies.
These generators use a low-temperature reaction of fuel and air to create electricity, continuously. When used in conjunction with solar modules, the generators can ensure optimal use of the sun’s energy at all times. The Mainspring generator also lets customers switch among multiple fuel options, including renewable options such as biofuels, green ammonia and green hydrogen.
“We designed the fuel-flexible Linear Generator so that as clean fuels become increasingly available and cost-effective, organizations of all kinds can capitalize on them without having to replace or retrofit equipment,” said Shannon Miller, Mainspring CEO and founder.

All electrolyzers have a technology-specific stack at their center, in which water is split into hydrogen and oxygen. This consists of carefully layered, gas-tight, welded bipolar plates and plastic membranes – among the main cost factors in every electrolysis plant. Xiaoting Wang, an analyst at BloombergNEF, spoke to 20 companies worldwide as part of the company’s “Electrolysis System Capex [capital expenditure] could drop 30% by 2025” study. This gave her an insight into the cost structure for 30 projects and made it possible to determine the price components for a 10 MW alkaline electrolysis plant in China in 2021, as an example.
The stack accounted for around 33% of the total costs, said Wang, with 40% of the costs coming from the other technical equipment, including power electronics, gas and liquid separation, and gas purification (see chart below). A further 27% of the costs were attributable to other project expense, such as civil engineering, equipment installation, and housing.

Chinese alkaline
The BNEF report stated a 10 MW alkaline system often consists of two stacks of 5 MW that deliver hydrogen at 16 bar. The manufacturer usually offers a complete solution with all accessories and installation. Chinese developers received such an offer in 2021 for as little as $303/kW – that is, a total of around €3 million ($3.2 million). This did not include the grid-connection fee, high-voltage transformers, or other “soft” costs such as expenses for development, approvals and financing agreements.
Wang said that the project costs in Western markets with domestically produced electrolyzers are around four times as high. Investment costs averaged €1,200/kW for alkaline electrolyzers and €1,400/kW for proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers.
Cheaper offers, such as €180/kW, from Peric for an 80 MW plant in China; or €521/kW, from Thyssenkrupp for a 2 GW plant in Saudi Arabia, do not include all project costs and are, therefore, not comparable. They do include electrolysis stacks, gas liquid separation and purification, and the water supply. However, power electronics and control cabinets are excluded.
Wang attributed this large price difference to low labor costs and the established supply chains in China, where manufacturers of electrolyzers can source materials and components at much lower prices than in the West. Thus far, the production of most electrolyzers is not automated. Chinese manufacturers were producing megawatt-scale electrolyzers for other industries before there was demand from green hydrogen producers, meaning they benefited from scaled production. Existing customers included manufacturers of polysilicon for photovoltaic cells.
The Bloomberg analysis, from September 2022, claimed that Western manufacturers could achieve similarly low costs. To do so, they would have to utilize highly automated production. Wang said she anticipates significant price reductions by as early as 2025 (see main chart above). Prices for 2021 also still included adequate margins for engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) companies. Long-term development shows that prices for electrolysis projects will converge worldwide from 2035.
Western investors tend to entrust an EPC company with the handling of an entire project for a lump sum, and to rely on large, well-known companies. Such companies usually have little experience in the construction of electrolysis plants, however, so the safety premiums in the price of the overall offer are high. With increasing experience and the entry of specialized project planners, which leads to more competition, these surcharges should decrease.
Prefabricated containers
Equipment suppliers are also endeavoring to offer products that reduce the workload on the construction site, and thus cut costs. One trend that supports this is the development of containerized systems. This means that the various system components do not have to be assembled on site but are instead prefabricated in a factory, tested, and delivered to the intended location. This minimizes sources of error and reduces the deployment time of specialist personnel on site.
In an update to its market analysis, Bloomberg reported on offers for such container solutions for $1,000/kW. Industry insiders have even reported offers as low as $700/kW, said Wang. One such container solution was presented in a pv magazine Germany webinar in February 2023. The PEM electrolyzer from German supplier H-Tec has an output of 1 MW and produces 450 kg of hydrogen per day. Recordings of pv magazine webinars are available at pv-magazine.com/webinars.
Those who want to reduce costs by purchasing an electrolyzer from China need to consider that exported products are usually sold at a premium of around 20% to 30%, compared to prices on the domestic market, said BloombergNEF, meaning that development and project planning costs would still be higher. It is important to consider that choosing a Chinese brand to supply the core equipment could reduce a project’s chance of receiving local subsidies and could affect financing.
The first green hydrogen projects were, and still are, mainly designed to draw electricity from the grid, with the electrolyzers’ electricity consumption balanced monthly or annually against the suppliers’ renewable electricity generation. In this case, the technical disadvantage of alkaline electrolysis in terms of flexibility would not bother operators.
However, after 2030, most new green hydrogen projects will need to ensure an hourly match between power generation and power consumption for grid-connected electrolysis systems, which will lead to more off-grid projects being developed, said Wang. This trend is not only due to the need for a clearer definition of green hydrogen. A direct connection to renewables generation plants should also improve economic feasibility in the future. After all, using the grid to shift huge amounts of electricity will cost more in the future. Electrolysis with stable grid electricity will, therefore, not be able to produce cheaper hydrogen in the future than with solar and wind energy, with their low electricity generation costs.

Cost reduction
This is where PEM electrolyzers come into play. These can better follow the fluctuating electricity supply and also work efficiently in partial load operation or off-grid. However, this technology still needs to significantly reduce its dependence on expensive platinum group metals, especially iridium, in order to gain a dominant market share, said Wang. Plug Power, from the United States, and ITM Power, from the United Kingdom, use 200 grams to 300 grams of iridium per megawatt of capacity.
Current worldwide production of iridium is around seven metric tons per year. Even if the entire volume were used to produce catalysts for PEM electrolysis, this supply chain could only support a maximum of 35 GW per year. PEM can only dominate the green hydrogen market if manufacturers manage to significantly reduce the consumption of iridium per unit this decade or achieve an equivalent effect in parallel with improved metal recycling. Wang said Electric Hydrogen, a new United States-based manufacturer of PEM electrolyzers, has already reported using significantly less iridium than competitors.
There is also a chance that anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysis could replace PEM after 2030 because it does not use expensive metals. This means manufacturers must succeed in developing stacks that are suitable for large scale projects. Enapter is an AEM pioneer, building small stacks and assembling them into larger 1 MW units which are still small compared to other electrolyzers. California-based company Verdagy is just starting to sell 20 MW modules, each consisting of two 10 MW stacks.

Larger stacks
Producing more hydrogen from a single stack is another route to cost reduction. One way to achieve this is by increasing the size of the stack itself. The largest commercial stack, with 15 MW, which came onto the market in September 2023, comes from Longi, according to Wang. Although increasing the size of the stack sounds straightforward, it has several disadvantages. First, it becomes more difficult to move large units, especially for international sales. Second, with larger units, mechanical forces and stresses become more uneven, which affects safety and is associated with lower efficiency.
More yield can be achieved by increasing the current density. Put simply, the more electrons that pass through the stack, the more hydrogen can be produced. Simply applying a higher voltage can increase the current density but has a detrimental effect on efficiency. The strategy to maintain or even increase efficiency is to revise the internal structures and introduce advanced catalysts and membranes.
Over the long term, it is preferable to increase the current density, said Wang. Plug Power and ITM Power are in the lead here with a current density of more than 3A/cm2 (amperes per cm2) followed by AEM manufacturer Verdagy, with 2A/cm2. Most Chinese alkaline electrolyzers have only 0.3A/cm2. Wang, in turn, has learned from Electric Hydrogen that their product would have an even higher current density than Plug Power and ITM Power. She estimated that, by 2030, current densities close to 10A/cm2 will be typical for the remaining manufacturers of PEM electrolyzers.
More competition
The costs of Western products could initially fall by around 30% by 2025. In addition to technological progress, competition is also likely to increase. Manufacturers worldwide have announced a production capacity of 52.6 GW for this year while deliveries are optimistically only 5 GW, according to BloombergNEF’s forecast. In China, where there is already fierce competition for orders from project developers, manufacturers’ margins are small. In addition, developers hedge their risk against the manufacturer by paying only up to 85% of the agreed price on delivery and the rest once commissioning has been completed and performance is still good after 18 months.
The pressure is not yet as high on Western markets, as investors and project developers in Europe and the United States can reckon with relatively high subsidies. However, production capacities are also increasing here and factories need to be fully utilized. If Chinese manufacturers also seek their salvation in exports, it is foreseeable that the price war will increase in all markets.
