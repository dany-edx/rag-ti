BeGreen has a project pipeline of more than 6 GW, with an average project size of 300 MW. Since its establishment, it has developed and sold more than 700 MW of solar capacity.
“BeGreen has a proven track record as a solar developer and a strong project pipeline in attractive power markets,” said Pål Eitrheim, executive vice president of Renewables at Equinor. “For Equinor, this is a step to deliver on our aim of being a market-driven power producer.”
BeGreen will become a subsidiary of Equinor. Its current team will continue to develop PV projects. The electricity generated by its existing portfolio will be sold on the wholesale electricity market by Equinor’s Danske Commodities subsidiary.
“The BeGreen acquisition is an example of how we selectively enter attractive markets through established companies characterized by high quality teams, proven track records and strong project pipelines,” said Olav Kolbeinstveit, senior vice president for power and markets within renewables at Equinor.
Equinor recently acquired East Point Energy LLC, an energy storage developer in the United States.

The project is part of the “Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge” developed by the US Department of Energy. It aims to develop and commercialize a new heat pump technology to more efficiency heat residential homes in climates with freezing temperatures.
Heat pump prototypes participating in the project must perform efficiently at temperatures equal or below negative 29 degrees Celsius (negative 20 degrees Fahrenheit). They are designed to be grid-interactive, provide high-efficiency heating performance in harsh climates, and employ environmentally friendly refrigerants.
The prototype heat pump first underwent a lab testing phase, with results allowing it to pass to the field-testing phase.
“We’re pleased with the lab performance of our prototype heat pump and the final test results,” said Justin Keppy, President, North America residential and light commercial HVAC at Carrier. “Our team of dedicated engineers and product managers are hard at work continuing to develop next generation heat pumps to increase efficiency, save consumers money and benefit the environment.”
Carrier joins Irish-based Trane Technologies and US-based Lennox heat pump manufactures in developing prototypes entering the field-testing phase. Other manufacturers participating in the project include Bosch, LG, and Daikin. Commercialization of the successful units is expected by 2024.

The project in Arad county, western Romania, is in a late-stage development phase. Rezolv Energy is now looking for technological solutions and debt financing options. It expects to start construction in the early months of next year and the plant is set for commissioning by 2025. It did not reveal the financial terms of the transaction.
Rezolv Energy was launched in August, backed by €500 million ($487.8 million) from sustainable infrastructure investor Actis. Upon its establishment, the company said it would “provide subsidy-free clean energy at a long-term, stable price for commercial and industrial users, and other off-takers” in the central and southeastern parts of Europe. It also announced agreements to acquire the development rights to two wind projects with a combined capacity of 1 GW.
The Romanian solar market is ready for a boom. Growth will be driven by an anticipated CfD scheme, which could guarantee a minimum electricity sale price and replace the former green certificates scheme.
“According to Romania's National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), the first CfD round for at least 1500 MW of capacity is supposed to be organized in 2H 2023 and the second in 1H 2025 for an additional 2000 MW,” Mihai Balan, the executive director of the Romanian Photovoltaic Industry Association (RPIA), told pv magazine.
The scheme, which the Romanian government is developing in cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), will be worth €125 million a year, based on guidelines published in 2020.
“It is a milestone in our NRRP that we have the first capacities supported by this mechanism up and running by 2026,” Balan said. “Initially, we were expecting the scheme to be presented to the public at the end of this year, but now, with the current situation on the energy market and the fact that we are steadily heading toward a regulated market, it is safe to say that we will see the details early 2023 at best.”
Earlier this year, Romanian Energy Minister Virgil Popescu told Reuters that the scheme will translate into “an explosion of renewable energy development.” However, he noted that CfDs would also be used “to finance conventional energy such as nuclear.”
Romanian solar is also having its time in the sun due to a combination of recent positive developments. They include the removal of a ban on power purchases agreements after almost 10 years, 1:1 quantitative compensation for prosumers with installations up to 200 kW in size, and the country’s first renewables tender for the deployment of 950 MW.
RPIA has responded by raising its expectations for at least 3 GW of renewables to be added by 2026, with solar accounting for around 2 GW of the total.
“We believe that more than 65% out of this capacity will come from solar, because of its shorter deployment time and given the obligation to have these projects connected to the grid by 2024,” Balan said earlier this year.
Romania could receive more than €16 billion in EU recovery and modernization funds by 2030 for its energy sector overhaul. The government has already allocated €457.7 million for the 950 MW procurement exercise launched in March, which was open to wind and solar projects, with the possibility of links to storage.
The country has committed to phasing out coal by 2032 and replacing it with nuclear, gas and renewable energy. It has also vowed to restructure lignite-fired holding CE Oltenia by 2026 and replace its old capacity with 725 MW of solar power and some gas.

In the “Guidelines for Operation and Maintenance of Photovoltaic Power Plants in Different Climates” report, the agency provided a series of climate-specific O&M programs for four climate zones – moderate, hot and dry, hot and humid, and deserts at high elevation areas. It also looked at extreme conditions such as floods, cyclones, and snow.
The paper defines O&M performance indicators and standard O&M operator services to create a clear framework.
“O&M contracts should take into account regional differences, such as national or local legislation that affects the availability of staff on-site, as well as variations in the capabilities of key stakeholders that affect project cost,” said IEA-PVPS.
The report also presents guidelines for monitoring and forecasting, as well as technical tools to analyze PV plant performance and safety.
“The scale and complexity of plants determine the level of monitoring: the larger and more complex the plant, the more intensive the monitoring,” said IEA-PVPS. “O&M operators need to be ready to comply with applicable grid codes and regulations, allowing for the re-evaluation of the scope of operations for contracts if grid codes change, especially in contexts where more RE plants replace thermal sources of power.”
The report also includes a description of different types of maintenance services and advanced inspections. IEA-PVPS offers a series of recommendations for climate–specific O&M.
“Preventive maintenance (PM) action plans that exclude redundant activities can bring costs down,” they emphasized. “The preventive maintenance plan should seek to optimize the overall PV plant and O&M budgeting, depending on the plant's size, design, complexity, and environment.”
The report concludes by warning that maintenance is required, even though PV plants require much less maintenance than other types of power generation assets.
“A combination of well–designed O&M specifications, proactive monitoring systems and a flexible and tailored O&M regime that considers both possible weather impacts on systems as well as possible changes to grid requirements are good practices to ensure that PV systems perform according to or even beyond expected lifespans,” the researchers said. “Reducing risks by ensuring that personnel are trained and equipped for O&M operations, as well as employing PV forecasting to reduce possible downtimes, also contribute to maintaining PV plant performance according to specifications.”

EDC will conduct a nationwide study to identify potential solar projects for implementation from this year to 2030. The study will also identify opportunities for an undisclosed amount of battery energy storage (BESS). Storage is expected to improve grid stability as the share of solar in Cambodia increases. “Of upmost importance for EDC is the stability of the grid, I presume they will use the BESS mostly for this purpose,” Massimiliano Tropeano, sustainability and garment expert at EuroChamb Cambodia told pv magazine.
It will initially identify a 100 MW pilot project to be built, financed, and operated by the private sector. ADB will assist Électricité du Cambodge in the bid, which is expected to mobilize up to $100 million in investments. The expected date of the bid was not disclosed.
“This program will be Cambodia's most ambitious yet in the renewable sector,” said Cleo Kawawaki, the head of ADB’s office of public-private partnership. “It will lower electricity costs and improve energy security by taking advantage of domestic resources. We hope to contribute to this effort by supporting a well-planned pipeline for transparent bids that attract active competition to optimize the efficiency, innovation, and capital of the private sector to benefit the people of Cambodia.”
The mandate builds on ADB’s earlier support to Cambodia’s solar sector. That includes backing for the country’s first National Solar Park in Kampong Chhnang, which will generate up to 100 MW of solar power. The government recently started to remove some hurdles to the adoption of renewable energy, and it is now considering halving the current monthly capacity fee on rooftop PV systems.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/03/ibc-solar-modules-may-drive-topcon-out-of-market-by-2028-says-tech-expert/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 3, 2022","IBC solar modules may drive TOPCon out of market by 2028, says tech expert","Solar modules built with cells based on both-sided contacted technology, such as TOPCon panels, could potentially be replaced by PV modules based on interdigitated back-contacted designs by the end of this decade, according to Radovan Kopecek, the co-founder and director of Germany's ISC Konstanz.
“This will depend on the fact that the extended use of tunnel oxide passivation for both polarities on a module rear side, as for IBC products, may become the most advantageous option,” Kopecek told pv magazine. “IBC solar modules may drive TOPCon panels out of the market by 2028.”
He said that the transition to IBC products could begin as early as 2025, with products based on both-sided contacts potentially becoming a thing of the past by 2030. He claims that the global market share of IBC modules could increase from around 2% in 2022 to about 6% in 2026, 20% in 2028, and more than 50% in 2030.
“Many Tier-1 manufacturers are already working on IBC besides their TOPCon development,” he said. “As both technologies have very similar aspects like the development of single-sided and fast poly-Si depositions, silver reduction, improvement of quality and costs n-type wafers, the switch will go quite fast.”
In his view, the switch will happen by adding complexity to existing production lines with standard equipment.
“We were extremely surprised in 2012, when we started our bifiPV workshop about the future of bifacial modules in Konstanz, that people did not see that bifacial PV will come with a high impact on the PV market,” Kopecek explained. “Now, in 2022 we are similarly surprised that people do not see that after the upcoming dominance of TOPCon the last evolutionary step to IBC will follow. The next step to tandem is not an evolutionary process anymore but a small revolution. And here I rather believe that it will take a while before this technology will be visible on the market.”
The success of IBC tech will materialize through efficiency improvements and lower production costs, he added.
“The efficiency gains should be ensured by the implementation of poly-Si passivation technology, while lower manufacturing costs should come from the adoption of copper or aluminum metal contacts,” Kopecek said. “We demonstrated already IBC cell efficiencies above 23% with 20mg of silver only using copper or aluminum. However, we believe that the dominancy of silver will continue and the switch will happen only in a yearly 1 TW to 3 TW market starting from 2028, when the PV industry will be forced to switch.”
He said that IBC solar cells have already reached efficiency levels of more than 24.5% and open-circuit voltages close to 730 mV, in comparison to 23% and 685 mV in PERC cells and 24% and 710 mV in TOPCon devices.
“But it is not only about efficiency. It is also about temperature coefficient, degradation, and bifaciality,” he said. “And even if the bifaciality of IBC may be slightly lower compared to TOPCon, front side efficiency, temperature coefficient, and degradation are much more important factors.”
He argued that the cost reduction of n-type wafers, in combination with the implementation of copper and aluminum metallization in IBC cells, could lead to module production costs below $0.20/W.
“At the moment, wafer and metallization costs are the major cost differences compared to PERC technology,” he said.
Kopecek said he also believes that technological advancements could lead to a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) in large ground-mounted solar plants with bifacial IBC panels to less than $0.01/kWh in many parts of the world in the future.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/03/silicon-heterojunction-solar-cell-with-23-83-efficiency-via-molybdenum-oxide-hole-collector/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 3, 2022",Silicon heterojunction solar cell with 23.83% efficiency via molybdenum oxide hole collector,"Researchers from the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands have fabricated a silicon heterojunction solar cell with a hole collector based on a molybdenum oxide (MoOx), which is a transition metal oxide (TMO) nanomaterial that has both novel nanoeffects and excellent semiconductor properties.
“Beyond the higher conversion efficiency obtained in our study, we have reached a deep understanding of the physical mechanisms that change the work function of MoOx layer during its growth,” researcher Olindo Isabella told pv magazine. “These mechanisms need to be balanced, primarily oxygen vacancies and dipole formation at the interface with silicon, in order to obtain a stable, ultra-thin MoOx layer that not only offers excellent transport properties for holes.”
The scientists built the cell with an n-type wafer on which they deposited a hydrogenated amorphous silicon ((i)a-Si:H) layer through a multi-chamber plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) tool. They used a front metal electrode consisting of electroplated copper (Cu) fingers at room temperature on top of a 200-nm-thick thermally evaporated silver (Ag) seed layer.
“The rear metal electrode was formed by 500-nm-thick thermally evaporated Ag. Finally, 100-nm-thick MgF2 was e-beam evaporated on the front side as an additional antireflection coating layer,” the scientists explained.
The team simulated the electrical properties of the cell by using the TCAD Sentaurus tool, which is a multidimensional simulator capable of simulating electrical, thermal, and optical characteristics of silicon-based and compound semiconductor devices. They found that the electronic properties of MoOx depend heavily on its oxidation states. They also discovered that, by fine-tuning the oxidation-reduction reaction between a substrate and MoOx, it is possible to adjust the working function of MoOx. films when their thickness is around 2 nm and their oxygen content increases.
The scientists also used PT (Plasma Treatment) and PTB (Plasma Treatment with Boron radicals) to gauge the presence of oxygen in the film and found these techniques offer a barrier to oxygen diffusion/reaction while providing for optimal electrical properties of the MoOx hole collector.
“We observed that oxygen content in MoOx layers deposited after PT and PTB conditions is higher than that in MoOx layers deposited in noPT condition,” they said.
They were able to produce a solar cell with a MoOx layer with a thickness of 1.7 nm and the device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.83% and a fill factor of 82.18%.
“The certified efficiency is – to the best of our knowledge – the highest to date on this type of device,” added Isabella. “The previous record was previously certified by École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) at 23.5%.”
The researchers presented the cell in “Achieving 23.83% conversion efficiency in silicon heterojunction solar cell with ultra-thin MoOx hole collector layer via tailoring (i)a-Si:H/MoOx interface,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.

An evolution in single-axis trackers, used in the vast majority of utility-scale projects in Australia, promises to reshape the potential for large-scale solar deployment on farms as well as culturally and environmentally sensitive sites.
In 2021, Nextracker and Array Technologies together commanded 77% of Australia’s “highly concentrated” tracker market, according to Rystad Energy's RenewableCube. Nextracker, the frontrunner in the Australian market, launched its NX Horizon-XTR line in March. Key to the line’s terrain-following capacity is that the XTR trackers work on a principle of being suspended from above, rather than supported from below, Nextracker CEO Dan Shugar told pv magazine Australia.
Its main competitor in Australia, Array Technologies, acquired one of Europe’s major tracker manufacturers, Soluciones Técnicas Integrales Norland (STI Norland), in January. Its terrain-following line, which allows a gradient of 1 degree between piles, is still almost a year away from market, however.
Out in front, Nextracker showed off pictures at All Energy 2022 of its first completed XTR project at Melbourne Water’s Winneke Solar Farm. The 9.54 MW (DC) plant, developed by Beon, sits on a culturally and environmentally significant site where groundwork had to be minimized to avoid disturbing indigenous artifacts.
“Therefore, a solution to protect the surrounding land from erosion, minimise grading and ground disturbance, and reduce any reseeding time was crucial,” Shugar said. “The project was also a pre-drill site, which made it even more challenging to construct within the cultural and environmental constraints and variances.”

Researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles, have developed a model that shows how much more the world would pay for solar modules if countries were to implement trade-limiting policies.
The group estimates that from 2008 to 2020, the United States saved between $19 billion to $30 billion on solar module pricing due to the free flow of capital, talent and innovation. Germany saved $5 billion to $9 billion, and China saved $26 billion to $46 billion. The groups suggest that if the three nations had “adopted strong nationalistic trade policies,” then module pricing in 2020 would have been 107% higher in the United States, 83% higher in Germany, and 54% higher in China.
The “Quantifying the cost savings of global solar photovoltaic supply chains” report suggests that if the world were to localize its supply chains, we could expect the price of solar to increase by 20% to 25% by 2030. Credit Suisse estimates that structural conditions in the United States resulted in a 33% higher price for solar panels through the end of the decade, when compared to China.
The researchers arrived at these numbers by estimating what they believe would be the costs of legislative actions taken in favor of “localizing benefits such as economic growth, employment, and trade surpluses.” The variance – $50 billion to $85 billion in savings from 2008 to 2020 – is based on varying levels of isolation from the global market’s learning curves. Nearly 800 GW of solar capacity was deployed during this period. Going forward, an additional 1.3 TW to 2.3 TW of capacity deployments are projected in the next decade, depending on how various policies facilitate that deployment.
The logic behind this study is as follows: If the production of a product is heavily localized within a country, then the global learning curves associated with that product will only be affected by solar modules deployed in that country. As each country is a part of the whole volume deployed, limiting trade lowers learning curves and raises prices.
The researchers have created an online tool that visualizes these equations. On the Projections tab, it is possible to adjust the percent of a benefit a country gains from global innovation versus being more nationally focused.
