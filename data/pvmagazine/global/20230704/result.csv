The facility in the Xinjiang region includes a PV generation complex, power transmission lines, a water electrolysis hydrogen production plant, hydrogen storage, and transport infrastructure. It aims to produce 20,000 tons of green hydrogen per year by using solar power for electrolysis. It has the capacity to store 210,000 cubic meters of hydrogen and transport 28,000 cubic meters per hour.
The Indian Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has released guidelines to incentivize green hydrogen and electrolyzer production. The first round will launch bids for 1.5 GW of electrolyzer capacity. Bidders can offer a minimum capacity of 100 MW and a maximum capacity of 300 MW. Incentives will remain in effect for five years starting from the commencement of electrolyzer production.
Verde Hydrogen has agreed to develop and commission a 2 MW green hydrogen electrolyzer project in Morocco. “The project will complete its installation in early 2024,” said the US-based company. The project features Verde Hydrogen's 2 MW containerized electrolyzers, with five modules in total, including two 20-foot containers and two 40-foot containers in a compact design.
 
The Spanish government has revised its 2030 hydrogen targets, nearly tripling them in the latest draft of its mational energy and climate plan. “About 11 GW of electrolyzers are planned for 2030 for the production of renewable hydrogen, mainly for industrial uses,” said the government. “The 11 GW is also an increase over the first estimates in the hydrogen roadmap, which set a target of 4 GW of electrolysis by 2030.”
Portugal has doubled its 2030 hydrogen targets, as stated in the latest draft of its National energy and climate plan. The Portuguese government said that it expects 5.5 GW of installed electrolysis capacity by 2030. Previously, the target was set at 2.5 GW of electrolysis capacity. The European Commission has told pv magazine Italia that Portugal and Spain are among the seven countries that have submitted their updated plans within the deadline.
Trelleborg Sealing Solutions has launched a range of sealing materials for various applications in the hydrogen value chain. This includes a new high-pressure ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber designed to perform well in a wide temperature range, and a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) optimized for extremely low temperatures. The Sweden-based engineering group claims that the materials exhibit superior resistance to rapid gas decompression and showcase excellent wear and extrusion properties.
Topsoe has selected Aveva Process Simulation to model its Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cells (SOECs) in order to optimize their design and establish an effective control strategy. The industrial software company said that Aveva Process Simulation is playing a role in accelerating the energy transition by enabling Topsoe's engineers to enhance the speed and efficiency of electrolyzer design and optimization.
HyCC has contracted McPhy for the supply of electrolyzers and Technip Energies for the design and construction of a 20 MW green hydrogen plant in Delfzijl, the Netherlands. The execution of the contract is contingent upon a final investment decision, which HyCC intends to make later this year. The plant, operated by HyCC, will use McPhy's electrolyzers to produce up to 3,000 tons of green hydrogen per year from renewable power and water. OCI Methanol Europe will use the green hydrogen to produce renewable methanol, resulting in a reduction of up to 27,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year, said HyCC.

Sorégies, a French gas and electricity supplier, has commissioned the first hybrid wind-solar power plant in France. The project includes a 5 MW PV plant installed on a landfill site in Savigné, located in the Vienne department of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, and a 24 MW wind farm deployed in the neighboring municipality of Saint Macoux.
“The necessary development of renewable energies is not without consequences for the electricity system, because the networks must then be able to accommodate this new electricity production,” said Soregies, in reference to a recent warning from French grid operator RTE about potential network congestion issues.
The wind farm and PV facility are connected to a shared substation. Through real-time communication and control, these two power stations enable maximized electricity production without the need for infrastructure expansion. Their shared network access point also enhances their load factor.
“This solution makes it possible to locally produce 5.3 GWh of additional green energy per year, with no impact on the electricity network,” said Anna Wachowiak, deputy general manager for Sorégies.
CRE, the country's regulator, selected the project in a recent tender for innovative renewable energy projects.

Electricity in Germany has become cheaper and cleaner since its last three nuclear power plants were shut down, according to new data from the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE.
Net electricity production from lignite and hard coal has decreased by more than 20%, while natural gas has experienced a minor decline. In contrast, renewables have reached a record share of 57.7% of net electricity generation.
According to Fraunhofer ISE, the German energy system successfully managed the nuclear phase-out. The decommissioned reactors' reduced output was offset by lower consumption, decreased exports, and increased imports.
Before being taken off the grid, the nuclear facilities generated 6.7 TWh in April. From April to June, there was a 7 TWh gap compared to the same period the previous year. Overall, electricity load dropped by 16 TWh in the first half of the year to 234 TWh, while electricity production decreased from 252 TWh to 225 TWh.
The feared 7 TWh gap was not filled by electricity from lignite, as production from lignite-fired power plants dropped to 41 TWh in the first half of 2023, down from 52 TWh in the same period last year. Net electricity production from hard coal also decreased from 26 TWh to 20 TWh. However, the decline in gas was minimal, going from 24 TWh to 23 TWh.
In contrast, renewable generation remained steady, resulting in a relative share of 57.7% of net electricity generation in the first half of the year, compared to 51% in the previous year.
In the latest issue of pv magazine we turn the spotlight onto European solar with a comprehensive review of the state of the PV industry across the region’s key markets and a look at the legislation which aims to drive a solar rooftop boom. We also examine the difficulty of establishing a solar panel recycling industry in Australia, where industry backbiting isn’t helping matters.
During this period, onshore and offshore wind turbines produced 67 TWh of green electricity, making them the largest energy source in the German electricity system. PV systems contributed 30 TWh, with only a slight decline of 0.6 TWh compared to the previous year. Notably, on May 4, photovoltaic generation set a record by surpassing 40 GW, and in June, wind power and photovoltaics combined generated a record 15 TWh of electricity.
According to Fraunhofer ISE, energy prices did not experience a shock but rather decreased. The volume-weighted average electricity price in the day-ahead auction was €100.54 ($190.56)/MWh, compared to €181.28/MWh in the same period last year and €53.42/MWh in 2021. The lower price is attributed to the cheaper natural gas, which currently averages €45.29/MWh, half the price compared to the first half of 2022, despite a €3 increase in the CO₂ price to €86.96 per ton.

Finding a global solution that is equitable for emerging nations and which drives energy access for the 80 countries that suffer from energy inequality and lack affordable, reliable, and clean energy is mission critical. The way forward is complex and lies in developing and scaling three “services” simultaneously: technology, integration, and finance.

Many emerging markets have ambitious plans. For example, Egypt is aiming for 42% of its energy to come from renewables by 2035, South Africa has targeted 18 GW of renewables generation capacity by 2030, and Nigeria is targeting 30% renewables this decade. Many countries are falling short, however, on the progress required to achieve the UN’s goal of providing universal access to sustainable energy for all within seven-and-a-half years. A key reason is lack of investment in both the necessary technology and in building out the network architecture needed to deploy reliable clean energy networks. One doesn’t just drop a smart battery and solar array into Lebanon and solve the problem. Integration infrastructure such as sales, installation, and service must be coupled with great technology and low-cost finance for end users. This infrastructure takes time, leadership, and money to scale, and we are very early in the evolution of that infrastructure.
Until recently, most pioneering solar energy providers – solar home system companies including Zola Electric, Sun King, Mkopa and others – had to build full-stack operations across technology, integration, and finance all at once. As the industry scaled, this attracted other players into the sector that were able to bring specialization, accelerating the growth and maturity of the industry.
One of the main challenges in many emerging markets is reliable access to a central grid. Over the last decade we have seen great progress in distributed energy innovation. We’ve seen the emergence of enterprise technology and hybrid hardware and software solutions enter the market and take distributed energy in emerging markets to the next level. We have seen companies small and large, across all energy-access markets tackle distribution and integration. Recent examples include Total in Nigeria, EDF in Ivory Coast, Econet in South Africa, Haiti Green Solutions, WaHa in Lebanon, and TEPNG in Papua New Guinea.
While there is still more to be done on the technology and integration fronts, finance and investment have today become the biggest impediment to rapid scale. This is where the world must focus, as the capital required to secure renewable energy access for emerging markets is typically found outside the nations adopting such technology.
If we are to deliver a distributed energy solution to drive energy access – and I believe that is the only way we will overcome our energy challenge in emerging markets – the question becomes “how can we best finance that?”
Part of the answer is through raising awareness of the immense opportunities available to deploy capital. It has been proven over the last decade that good credit is available to those who need it, even among the most vulnerable. That has been a considerable economic enabler and it is the same reason why energy credit in developed markets is so strong, and has been for a century.
Historically, energy credit was provided through local banks and other finance institutions. Emerging markets, though, lack the capital and sophistication to underwrite trillion-dollar needs. In recent years, however, fintech (financial technology) companies have started to build a digital pipe between investors and borrowers such that distribution and underwriting can be solved much more efficiently.
Technology remains the key enabler to integration and finance. It is what will ensure clean, affordable, and reliable energy remains an irresistible proposition to end users and investors. The arrival of new technology is set to transform the energy sector in emerging markets. Take the internet of things as an example. It is the hardware backbone of distributed energy, providing a vital digitally connected framework which enables intelligence and control that can be optimized through machine learning. The potential dividends of mass data aggregation, interpretation, and – ultimately – decision making are huge. This ecosystem can help predict energy demand, optimize energy distribution, and automate energy management – providing huge efficiency gains that can drive down energy costs.
As an example, at Zola Electric we are proud to be pioneering an enterprise technology platform that combines hardware and software in a distributed architecture that fills the white space in the clean energy landscape. Our systems help to replace expensive, polluting energy sources such as diesel or kerosene, driving forward the energy transition while delivering energy access and affordability where it is most needed. Put together, such flexibility and reliability are a game changer.
The scale of the problem in emerging markets can be quantified. More than 3 billion people and hundreds of millions of schools, clinics, and businesses across 80 countries lack access to reliable, affordable, and clean energy. We are committed to developing solutions that not only address energy inequality but do so without compromising sustainability. Previously, there was a choice to be made between reliable, low-cost supply, and sustainable solutions. We can demonstrate that choice no longer exists – irrespective of location. It is now possible to truly make an impact while addressing climate change.
Governments are committed to meeting their sustainable-development and climate goals. Expectations are higher than ever concerning the reliability and cost structure of revenue streams. The investment to develop and install the necessary infrastructure should follow. By doing things differently, we are solving one of the world's great problems and sending a powerful message that sustainable development goals can be met across the world.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/04/whats-behind-south-koreas-battery-fire-accidents/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 4, 2023",What’s behind South Korea’s battery fire accidents?,"A series of 28 consecutive battery fires that occurred in South Korea between 2017 and 2019 led the nation's energy storage market to complete paralysis.
The country's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) reached a handful of broad conclusions in its investigative report into the accidents. By taking systems apart and examining components, it identified a number of potential manufacturing defects and determined that some systems likely lacked sufficient protection against electric shock. It also used moisture, dust, and salt mist tests to identify weaknesses in the environmental oversight of battery systems.
In addition, MOTIE highlighted the issue of poor installation practices and noted problems that potentially arise when installers combine energy management and control system components from different manufacturers – even when such parts are not designed to be used as elements of an integrated system.
These causes, however, may not be all the reasons behind the accidents, according to new research from South Korea's Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST). “Our study considers the impact and risks associated with social factors related to the battery fires, which has rarely been considered in previous studies,” the research's lead author, Ji-Bum Chung, told pv magazine. “Although the risk of fire has been mitigated by the development of battery storage technology, there are still potential risks such as human error and normal accidents that can be caused by the people, organizations, and social context in which the technology is utilized.”
According to Chung, the fires in Korea were socially constructed by factors related to environments such as strong incentives, inadequate regulation, the different cultural backgrounds of the stakeholders, the tight coupling of various sub-technologies and miscommunication, the systematic pressure on profit-seeking, and a false sense of security.

“These social factors have influenced the occurrence of relevant social groups' (RSGs) negative interactions and have led to adverse outcomes such as the normalization of deviance and structural secrecy that accumulated fire risks,” Chung further explained. “Battery storage, a socially constructed technological artifact, has been negatively perceived by these groups due to consecutive accidental fires. Accordingly, in 2021, the Korean government changed storage policies from unusually strong support to zero support. The government's cold attitude led to a deterioration in the profitability of the batteries which acted as an obstacle to industrial growth, along with the fire risk.”
In the paper “Social construction of fire accidents in battery energy storage systems in Korea,” which was recently published in the Journal of Energy Storage, Chung and his colleagues presented the results of 24 interviews conducted in 2021 aimed to collect the stakeholders' different interpretations of the cause of the battery fires, including members who have participated in the two official investigation committees set up by MOTIE.
“Semantic Network Analysis (SNA) and Thematic Analysis (TA) were performed on all textualized interview data to explore the significant issues,” the researchers explained. “During the interviews, we found that social factors, such as policies, regulations, and organizational characteristics, were considered as an influence on battery fire risks.”
They also utilized the social construction of technology (SCOT) theory to investigate the construction process of battery storage technology. This theory says that technology does not determine human action, but that rather, human action shapes technology.
The group concluded that the RGSs didn't fully understand both the advantages and risks of the storage technology and viewed the batteries as a way of pursuing economic incentives. “Such naïve technology utilization and lack of risk awareness are motivations for deterring future technology risks,” it stated. “Acceptable risks can cause members to make irrational choices based on their interests. If a battery is abused, the risk of thermal runaway increases.”

Spanish energy giant Acciona Energia, Italy’s Enel Green Power, and a joint bid from Australian energy heavyweight Origin and Sydney-based renewables outfit Energy Estate have been shortlisted to deliver what would be one of Queensland’s largest renewable energy projects.
QEM said the bidding process to deliver the 1 GW capacity project had generated strong interest and commercial negotiations with the shortlisted parties will commence later this month.
QEM Managing Director Gavin Loyden said the company had prioritised the design and development of the renewables project with the primary objective of obtaining low-cost power for its flagship Julia Creek project.
“Critical minerals like vanadium are vital for the global transition to clean energy,” he said. “The opportunity for QEM and the broader North West Minerals Province is to harness the region’s wind and solar resource above the ground to explore, develop and refine the critical minerals under it.”
The proposed wind and solar project would not only deliver energy to the proposed mine but also connect into the AUD 5 billion ($3.3 billion) CopperString transmission line that is to link Queensland’s isolated northwest to Australia’s national grid. The transmission project, which is being delivered by Queensland government-owned network operator Powerlink, is expected to link an estimated 6 GW of renewable energy resources into the National Electricity Market, while also opening up access to large deposits of minerals seen as key to the energy transition.
Colin Langton, director of operations of the CopperString project at Powerlink, said the “scale of renewable generation at Julia Creek will be integral to the overall CopperString project … With the high quality and enormous potential scale of renewables in the area, the north and northwest is well positioned to become the future powerhouse of Queensland.”
QEM said it has been conducting wind and solar monitoring at the Julia Creek site for the past 12 months to de-risk the hybrid wind and solar project. Environmental assessments, topographic surveys, preliminary flood modeling and geotechnical studies have also been completed.
Loyden said the “highly encouraging” monitoring results would form a crucial component of the pre-feasibility study for the proposed renewables project.

SAEL Industries, NLC India, and KPI Green Energy have emerged as the winners in Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam’s tender for 800 MW of solar, with an additional 800 MW under a greenshoe option. The winning developers will set up solar power projects in Khavda Solar Park on a build-own-operate basis.
SAEL Industries secured 400 MW and NLC India 300 MW at a tariff of INR 2.71 ($0.031)/kWh each. KPI Green Energy won 100 MW at INR 2.70/kWh. 
A prominent developer told pv magazine that the winning prices are similar to those discovered in the last round of bidding for Khavda Solar Park. The project site poses some challenges, but the benefits of land availability and evacuation arrangements far outweigh them, according to the developer.
The project site is close to the seashore, so salinity could affect the solar panels and other equipment. In addition, the solar structure needs to be designed to withstand high wind speeds (200 km/hour) in the zone. The best part of this project is that all the basic infrastructure, including land on lease for 25 years, is provided by GUVNL against an upfront amount as per the tender document.

“We employed a low power deposition method for the production of AZO and i-ZnO/AZO bilayer structures used in the cell,” the research's corresponding author, Ganesh Regmi, told pv magazine, noting that this approach is intended at improving the cell efficiency and durability. “By utilizing this technique, the aim is to avoid raising the substrate temperature, which could lead to adverse effects such as atom implantation into the cadmium sulfide (CdS) layer and potential short-circuiting.”
The scientists said this technique eliminates the need for post-deposition treatment, a customary practice in conventional methods that can negatively impact the integrity of the solar cell layers. “In traditional high-efficiency CIGS thin-film solar cells, a relatively thick ZnO layer , with a thickness of 200−300 nm, is commonly employed as the window layer,” Regmi explained. “However, this approach restricts the flexibility of the solar cells, rendering them unsuitable for certain applications.”
The group built the cell with a monolayer made of molybdenum (Mo), the CIGSe absorber, a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, a window layer of zinc oxide (i-ZnO), and a zinc oxide (ZnO) film. The device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 9.53%, an open-circuit voltage of 530 mV, and short-circuit current density of 27.34 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 65.78%.
The academics claimed that the AZO films exhibited good transmittance and well-crystalline morphology, as well as remarkable electrical conductivity. “This outcome validates the successful implementation of the proposed methods and provides evidence of the potential viability of this approach,” Regmi stated.
They described the device in the study “Aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) ultra-thin films deposited by radio frequency sputtering for flexible Cu(In,Ga)Se2solar cells,” published in Memories – Materials, Devices, Circuits and Systems. The group includes scientists from the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (Cinvestav) in Mexico and the Tribhuvan University in Nepal.

The researchers have developed an approach that goes beyond considering each resource individually and focuses on their combined utilization. By strategically locating facilities where solar and wind resources can complement each other, they aim to achieve greater efficiency. According to the researchers, implementing this strategy optimally could reduce monthly anomalies in total electricity production from solar and wind sources by up to 60%.
To determine suitable locations, the researchers have combined data and patterns of solar radiation and wind speed over time in specific regions. This allows them to identify areas where favorable conditions exist for higher yields between the two energy sources.
“The target spatial domain and temporal scale (at which the temporal variability of the production is to be reduced) are eligible fields, the total shares of each technology can be fixed, forced to stay above/below certain thresholds or let free to find their optimum, and the minimum production to be guaranteed can be modified,” said the scientists. “Also, an additional code is made available on the webpage to find optimum locations for new installations given that the current spatial distribution of installations is known, which might be the most useful application of the tool for the short-term decision making.”
They presented the new tool in the paper “An Action-Oriented Approach to Make the Most of the Wind and Solar Power Complementarity,” published in Earth's Future.
“The method, implemented in an open-access user-friendly and customizable tool called Climax (http://climax.inf.um.es/), has been proven here in an illustrative pilot study over pan-European regions for which the temporal variability of the monthly wind-plus-solar production is to be reduced,” the scientists said.

India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has released the guidelines for its incentive schemes for green hydrogen and electrolyzer production. The MNRE has appointed Solar Energy Corp. of India Ltd (SECI) as the implementing agency for the schemes. 
The ministry said that the incentives for green hydrogen production may be offered through several models, including competitive bidding based on incentives demanded. Under incentive-based bidding, the bidders will be required to quote the annual production capacity of green hydrogen and/or its derivatives for which the incentive is sought and the incentive demanded for each of the first three years of production. 
Incentives will be provided for five years from the commencement of electrolyzer manufacturing. The selection of beneficiaries will be based on the domestic value addition and performance quotient (specific energy consumption of the electrolyzer produced).
In the first round, bids will be launched for 1.5 GW of electrolyzer capacity. The minimum bid capacity is 100 MW and the maximum is 300 MW.
Sandeep Agarwal, founder and managing director at Greenzo, said the MNRE’s initiative will encourage many more investments in the production of electrolyzers in the Indian market. Agarwal said Greenzo Energy is setting up an alkaline electrolyzer manufacturing factory with an annual capacity of 250 MW in Sanand, Gujarat, and will benefit from the incentive scheme.
“As an MSME we appreciate this initiative, which will not only support the growth of the green hydrogen industry but also encourage the production of electrolyzers within the country,” he added. “This step aligns with the larger goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2070.”

West Australian government-owned energy generator and retailer Synergy said site works have started on a new 200 MW/800 MWh big battery being built alongside the 100 MW/200 MWh Kwinana battery energy storage system that is currently working through its final testing and commissioning process.
The 200 MWh first stage of the Kwinana battery project is expected to be fully integrated into the state’s main grid by the end of the week, just as work begins on the AUD 625 million ($415 million) second stage which will provide four times as much storage capacity.
The 800 MWh second stage of the battery energy storage system, which is scheduled to be completed by late 2024, is being built on a three-hectare plot adjacent to the first grid-scale battery established at the site of the decommissioned Kwinana Power Station about 30 kilometres south of Perth.
Synergy, which will operate and manage the battery energy storage system, said the new battery will comprise 288 shipping container-sized battery modules and 72 inverter units that will employ new-generation technology to support grid stability by storing electricity when demand is lowest and delivering it back into the grid during peak times, providing vital system security for the South West Interconnected System (SWIS).
West Australian Premier Roger Cook said the battery will serve as the “infrastructure of future”, playing a major role in the state’s energy transformation with WA’s state-owned coal power stations to be retired by 2030.
It is expected the battery will support the integration of more renewable energy into the grid, smooth fluctuations in demand and renewable energy supply and substantially contribute to grid security and stability.
The West Australian government has allocated AUD 2.8 billion in its latest budget for renewable energy infrastructure, including a 500 MW/2,000 MWh battery energy storage system to be built near the coal town of Collie in the state’s southwest. The development application for the Collie big battery is expected to be submitted later this year.
The West Australian government has estimated that the SWIS may need about 50 GW of new renewable electricity and storage infrastructure to support increased demand over the next 20 years.
