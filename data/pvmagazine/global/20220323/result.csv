The commissioner for financial stability, financial services and the capital markets union was making the case for time-limited use of the controversial energy sources as part of the energy transition and said both would be needed to keep the lights on and that the strict rules laid down for their definition as “transition technologies” would be better than leaving investors and the markets to play by their own rules.
“Investment, public and private, into gas and nuclear, will continue for the time being,” McGuinness told members of the parliament's economic and environmental committees. “It is, in my view, better that we guide that investment and place it within very strict criteria to govern the transition than to leave it to the market, without constraints or timelines.”
The commissioner was referring to rules laid down in the complementary delegated act (CDA) drafted by the executive which stipulate any gas project investment will only be considered sustainable if the infrastructure switches to clean or “low-carbon” gas by 2035 at the latest, and which calls for strict measures on nuclear waste.
Dutch Green Party MEP Bas Eickhout pointed out “low-carbon” gas could still refer to natural gas, as long as it was fitted with carbon capture and asked, of the proposed requirement new nuclear plants have a waste plan in place by 2045: “How can that relate to ‘do no harm?'” in reference to the requirement that EU policy do no significant harm to the bloc's environment or its climate goals.
The argument made by McGuinness about the need to guide investors, however, was undermined by her repeated statements the taxonomy is not a mandatory measure, with the Fine Gael party member saying: “We don't force anyone to use it, this is not energy policy, this is not a mandatory statement of what you have to do.
Replying to charges the commission was telling investors the energy sources are green, McGuinness said: “I do not regard gas and nuclear as green.” She had earlier attempted to stress the time-limited usefulness of gas and nuclear by saying: “The CDA is about alternatives that aren't sustainable but, by following strict rules, can make a much bigger contribution to our climate goals.”
The commissioner came under fire for refusing to heed the recommendation made by its own advisory body, the Platform on Sustainable Finance, not to include gas and nuclear in its sustainable investment taxonomy. Dutch Labour Party MEP Paul Tang said: “You've ignored the science-based advice of the sustainable finance platform. You've ignored and insulted the European Parliament by choosing the back door of a delegated act rather than the front door of primary legislation. Even loyal European member states like Luxembourg and Austria are willing to go to court [to block the CDA]. You've destroyed the science-based standard, you've failed to find a political compromise, and you've insulted European institutions and democracy. And, may I add, your timing is spectacularly lousy.”
It was a theme that German MEP Michael Bloss, of the Alliance 90/The Green party warmed to when he stated: “You said you don't want to insult the parliament but the parliament voted to exclude nuclear from the taxonomy and now you're putting nuclear into the taxonomy via a delegated act. How is that not disrespecting a decision taken by the parliament?”
Slovak MEP Martin Hojsík, a member of the Renew Europe group, said: “In central and Eastern Europe, where I'm from, countries have been pushing for [the inclusion of gas and nuclear in the taxonomy]. It's basically a politically-based decision, let's be honest, it's not a science-based decision.” Petros Kokkalis, of Greek party Syriza, returned to the rejection of the advice offered by the Platform on Sustainable Finance, saying: “You said the platform is scientists but then you said: ‘we have our own scientists.'” He concluded by asking how there could be two scientific truths.
“This is science-based,” McGuinness said of the CDA, “there's always a political part of decision making, I think that's how we operate … but it is science based.”
Bogdan Rzońca, of Poland's Law and Justice Party, suggested non-Russian coal, gas, and oil could help Europe through its energy crisis but McGuinness, responding to a question from Finnish MEP Nils Torvalds about whether Russian gas, Australian coal, or Finnish peat were dirtier, said: “You hear now about countries debating reopening more coal, burning more coal, this is something that none of us want to see.
Swedish Social Democrat Jytte Guteland said the debate over energy sources was not about keeping the lights on, as McGuinness had suggested, but “about whether we should sit [on Russian president Vladimir] Putin's knee many years from now.”
In response, the Irish commissioner refused to name the Russian leader.
The European Parliament has until July 9 to decide whether to carry out the threat made by Spanish Socialist Workers' Party member César Luena, who said: “If you don't withdraw this CDA, we will vote against it.”
That July deadline can be extended by two months, if necessary.

German aggregator 1Komma5° and US-based micro-inverter manufacturer Enphase Energy announced a strategic partnership for the German and European markets on Wednesday.
The long-term partnership is intended at developing internet of things (IOT) applications, explained 1Komma5° founder, Philipp Schröder, and at building a virtual power plant that should enable consumers to benefit from the volatility of the electricity market through the utilization of charging electric vehicles or storage systems in times of low electricity prices.
“We want to enable our customers to generate additional income through our energy IOT project this year,” Schröder told pv magazine. “We expressly invite other manufacturers to follow this example so that end customers can finally benefit from the full value of smart networked systems and the pooling of flexible loads,” Schröder continued.
1Komma5° has set itself the goal of equipping 1.5 million buildings in Europe with photovoltaics, storage systems, recharging solutions for electric vehicles, and heat pumps by 2030 – a plan that may need a total investment of around €30 billion. The German start-up usually invests in local installation companies in order to accelerate their growth and has, now, offices at 13 locations in Germany and Sweden.
“Our goal is to work with the best regional players to bring Enphase technology to as many customers in Europe as possible,” said Enphase CEO Badri Kothandaraman. “By providing granular access to a homeowner's clean energy assets, such as photovoltaics, battery, EV charging station, and heat pump systems, we can enable 1Komma5° to offer additional energy services.”
Enphase said its “IQ Gateway” technology will be crucial to allow 1Komma5° to integrate intelligent energy tariff structures into its products in order to optimize electricity prices for customers, added Jannik Schall, chief product officer at the German company. The plans of 1Komma5° also provide for further partnerships for all areas including heat pumps, energy storage, charging stations, and solar modules. “Above all, we see the integration of energy IOT and access to interfaces in the foreground but of course also securing energy supply and competitive prices,” explained Schröder.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/23/jinkosolar-shipped-25-2gw-of-pv-products-in-2021/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"MARCH 23, 2022",JinkoSolar shipped 25.2GW of PV products in 2021,"Chinese panel maker JinkoSolar shipped photovoltaic products with an aggregate capacity of 25,242MW in the past fiscal year, according to the financial results published by the company. Solar modules accounted for a good 22.2GW of total shipments, which is an increase of more than 18% in sales, compared to 2020.
Overall, the company's sales increased by 16.2% to $6.41 billion and the net result more than doubled, to $113.1 million.
JinkoSolar CEO, Xiande Li, said 2021 was a challenging year due to the well-known global supply chain issues. “Thanks to our competitive advantages in supply chain management and [our] global network, we were able to respond quickly to supply chain volatility and logistical challenges,” he added.
The latest edition of pv magazine investigates the rapid rise of TOPCon cell manufacturing. While not the only option PV manufacturers have their eye on, TOPCon is already the first n-type cell to claim significant market share. We chart the tech’s progress from laboratory to gigawatt production, plus efforts to standardize process flows, reduce costs, and raise performance.
In addition, JinkoSolar has further improved its internal production capacities in order to reduce costs and better hedge against risks in deliveries. “As a result, our deliveries, sales, and profitability increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to the previous quarter,” Li explained.
Several milestones were also reached in the current fiscal year. The most important operating subsidiary, Jiangxi Jinko, is now successfully listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board. This has brought JinkoSolar revenues of RMB10 billion ($1.56 billion), which will mainly go towards accelerating technology advancement and business expansion.
Moreover, the manufacturer forecasts another significant increase in demand for decentralized photovoltaic solutions. “In China, where full-year 2021 installation reached 55GW, distributed generation accounted for more than half of the new installations, due to its higher [financial] yield,” Li continued.
JinkoSolar also said that the switch from p-type to n-type solar modules has also paid off as it is seeing growing global demand for its high-efficiency Tiger Neo modules. “We will expand the leadership of our n-type modules in both domestic and overseas markets. In the first quarter of 2022, we have a capacity of around 16GW for n-type cells in operation and are currently expanding our production capacity continuously,” said Li. “As the integrated capacity structure keeps improving, our integrated costs are expected to decrease further.”
JinkoSolar also revealed that it started production at its new wafer factory in Vietnam in the first quarter, which has an annual production capacity of almost 7GW. “This nearly-7 GW of the integrated overseas monocrystalline wafer, cell, and module manufacturing capacity greatly enhances our global supply chain advantage. At the same time, we have strategically worked with our supply chain partners to combine our complementary resources and build integrated industrial ecosystems,” Li said.
JinkoSolar also dared to provide an outlook for the current fiscal year, noting that it is still characterized by some uncertainties regarding end-customer demand and delivery plans, emphasized the management board.
For the first quarter, the module maker is targeting sales of between 7.5 and 8.0GW and, for the full year 2022, JinkoSolar expects to ship between 35 and 40GW of PV products.
In addition, its production capacities should be further expanded. For monocrystalline wafers, annual capacity should reach 50GW by the end of the year, and that for solar cells should grow to 40GW, with 16.9GW being intended for the production of n-type solar cells. The annual production capacity for solar modules should top 60GW by the end of the year.

New Delhi-based Gautam Solar has launched the G-2X Mono series of bifacial solar panels for rooftop and ground-mounted PV plants. The modules provide a peak power output of 566W, with front and back power conversion efficiency of up to 25.72%, according to the manufacturer. The rear-side offers a 10-30% gain in power generation, Gautam said.
The modules use A+ grade mono PERC cells, high-quality transparent backsheets, split junction boxes, and the highest-grade raw materials, the company added.
“[The] G-2X Mono Series will reduce the balance-of-system (BOS) and installation costs and offer a higher power generation of up to 30% in the same available area for solar power plant customers,” said the manufacturer. “This is ideal for megawatt scale solar plants, where maximum power generation per unit of the land area is a very important determinant for the project's success.”

French heating and energy savings specialist Aterno has launched PowerPark, a new solar carport solution for small and medium-sized businesses.
The carport measures 5.20×5.51m and its height varies between 2.33 and 2.93m. It can host two vehicles and is powered by 15 monocrystalline solar panels with a total capacity of 5.65kW, which corresponds to a generation capacity of between 9,300 and 15,400 kWh/year depending on the location.
“The continuous rise in the price of electricity, coupled with the high environmental expectations of consumers, are increasingly encouraging small and medium-sized businesses to gain energy independence,” said Aterno president Thierry Fallard. “Aware of this major concern, we decided to design PowerPark.”
Designed and manufactured entirely in Alsace, the PowerPark can be installed on all types of ground, regardless of the configuration of the car park and whether or not leaning against a building, the manufacturer said. In order to adapt to all locations, the company offers a modular, scalable system that can host two or more vehicles.
According to the company, the carport can be deployed and start operation within 48 hours and the solar array can also be equipped with one or more WallBox charging stations for hybrid or electric vehicles.
The new product comes with a 15-year guarantee and is sold starting from €19,900, excluding VAT, depending on the system configuration.

Sweden-based energy company Vattenfall commissioned its first hybrid, utility scale wind-photovoltaic-storage project in the Dutch province of South Holland on Tuesday.
The energy park Haringvliet benefits from synergy effects which lead to lower development costs and reduces the impact on the environment, according to Vattenfall, which sees its first so-called full hybrid power plant as a blueprint for many other projects.
The power plant consists of a 38MW photovoltaic power plant and a 22MW wind farm connected to 288 batteries in 12 standard containers. The three systems share the same grid connection.
“We are gaining important experience with the project which we also want to use here in Germany,” explained Claus Wattendrup, head of the solar and batteries business unit at Vattenfall. “The combination of generation and storage can serve as an example for more efficient planning and implementation of such projects. This can also accelerate the expansion of renewable energy in Germany.”
The generation plants complement each other, with the photovoltaic system supplying plenty of electricity during the day, and from spring to autumn, while the wind turbines produce a particularly large amount in the winter months. At the same time, the battery storage ensures that the grid remains stable and serves as a temporary storage facility for the electricity generated. According to Vattenfall, specially developed software ensures that the various components work together optimally.
The company also emphasizes the advantages of the integrated planning and development of such full hybrid power plants. In Germany, the period between planning and the first generation of electricity for wind farms is seven years, on average. But if the photovoltaic system and battery storage are included from the start there would be important time savings in planning. In addition, the joint realization is more cost-effective than if each technology is deployed individually, as they share the same substation, the same cables and service routes.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/23/latent-heat-thermophotovoltaic-battery-for-renewables-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 23, 2022",Latent heat thermophotovoltaic battery for renewables storage,"A group of scientists from the Technical University of Madrid has fabricated a latent heat thermophotovoltaic (LHTPV) battery that is able to store electricity in the form of latent heat at temperatures of over 1,000 degrees Celsius and then convert the stored heat to electricity on demand using a thermophotovoltaic system consisting of a thermal emitter and a photovoltaic diode cell.
“We have built a small, laboratory scale prototype of less than 1kWh of storage capacity,” the research's corresponding author, Alejandro Datas, told pv magazine. “To reach commercial maturity, we need to build a system with several megawatt-hours of energy capacity, which may require some time and a large amount of funds. However, we are already working on that and, hopefully, we can speed things up if we find the right partners to scale the technology.”
The proposed system uses renewable electricity to melt, at temperatures over 1,000 degrees Celsius, low-cost metals such as silicon or ferrosilicon alloys, which are able to store energy during their fusion process, thus producing the so-called “latent heat.” According to the research team, a liter of silicon material is able to store more than 1kWh of latent heat, which corresponds to the energy contained in a liter of hydrogen pressurized at 500 bar. “However, unlike hydrogen, silicon can be stored at atmospheric pressure, making the system potentially cheaper and safer,” it further explained.
The thermophovoltaic generator used for the device is described by the researchers as a miniature photovoltaic system that can generate up to 100 times more energy than a conventional PV installation. According to the researchers' calculations, if a square meter of a conventional PV array produces 200W, a square meter of thermophotovoltaic system may generate up to 20kW. “The efficiency of thermophotovoltaic cells ranges between 30 and 40% depending on the temperature of the heat source,” they emphasized. “Furthermore, the use of thermophotovoltaic generators, instead of conventional heat engines, avoids the use of moving parts, fluids, and complex heat exchangers.”
The silicon and ferrosilicon alloys can store energy at a cost of less than €4 per kWh, although its commercial costs may be higher as the system currently does not integrate a container and thermal insulation. “It would be possible to reach costs of around €10 per kilowatt-hour if the system is large enough, typically more than 10MWh, since the cost of thermal insulation would be a small fraction of the total cost of the system,” the Spanish group emphasized, noting that if costs will be further reduced, it may be enough to recover only 30-40% of the energy in the form of electricity, to make these devices more profitable than lithium-ion batteries. “Additionally, the remaining 60-70% of the heat that is not converted to electricity can be delivered directly to buildings, factories, or cities, reducing your natural gas consumption.”
The battery was presented in the paper “Latent heat thermophotovoltaic batteries,” which was recently published in Joule. “If the price of stationary lithium-ion batteries remains high, it will be necessary to combine them with other, cheaper technologies, such as thermophotovoltaic batteries, which allow larger amounts of electricity to be stored,” Datas concluded.
*The article was updated on March 28 to reflect that the figure €4 per kWh refers to the cost at which silicon and ferrosilicon alloys can store energy, and not to the cost at which the device stores energy.

Read about material sourcing for batteries, lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.

Fabienne Demol, executive VP and global head of business development at Total Eren, was quoted in a press release issued by Chariot Transitional on Monday. She said: “The combined solar and wind capacity will offer strong complementarity and power generation around the clock, with solar produced during the day and wind mainly at night.”
The statement did not explain how the generation capacity would be split between solar and wind projects nor where the panels and turbines would be located, although the general manager of First Quantum‘s Kansanshi Mine was quoted and it is believed all of the miner's activity in Zambia concerns copper extraction.
Chariot Transitional executive director Laurent Coche, also quoted in the press release, said construction of the renewables facilities would start next year. He stated: “We are very excited to be partnering with FQM [First Quantum Minerals] and Total Eren on this ground-breaking 430MW project in Zambia.

“Our research shows that illumination of ceramic materials for fuel cells, and possibly for batteries in the future, can significantly increase ion mobility,” said TUM scientist Jennifer L M Rupp, noting that the novel technology was initially used to improve ion mobility at ceramic grain boundaries.
The removal of the barriers that prevent the mobility of ions should be achieved at lower temperatures than those required in the production of solid-oxide fuel cells, which usually are of up to 700 degrees Celsius. “Our dream was to see if we could overcome the barriers using something that doesn’t require heat. Could we get the same conductivities with another tool?” said lead author Thomas Defferriere. “This tool turned out to be light, which had never been investigated in this context before.”
According to the research group, the grain boundary conductance of gadolinium-doped cerium oxide, which is a ceramic used as a solid-state electrolyte in fuel cells, can be improved by a factor of approximately 3.5 at 250 degrees Celsius, by applying the proposed light technique. They also found that the activation energy needed to trigger this process can be lowered from 1.12 to 0.68eV.
“This newly discovered ‘opto-ionic effect' could find a wide range of applications in the future,” the academics affirmed. “For example, it could improve the performance of solid-state electrolytes in tomorrow's lithium-ion batteries and thus facilitate higher charging speeds, or could pave the way to the development of new electrochemical storage and conversion technologies that work at lower temperatures and achieve higher efficiency levels.”
Their findings were introduced in the paper “Photo-enhanced ionic conductivity across grain boundaries in polycrystalline ceramics,” published in nature materials.

In its press release, the government said that the project will involve deep-sea desalination and will use solar power to bring water from the site's lower reservoir to the upper reservoir. “The freshwater will then be gravity fed downhill through hydropower turbines, generating electricity. The water will then be channeled to reservoirs downstream to be used for household purposes and irrigation,” Holness added.
“Renewables currently account for 13% of our energy generation mix and our stated target for renewables is 30% by 2030. This will still leave us extremely vulnerable to global oil price shocks.

The 280MW Cultana Solar Farm has been on the drawing board for more than four years but project developer Simec Energy Australia, a part of British industrialist Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance, has in recent weeks published a string of notices indicating work on the renewable energy power plant is about to begin.
“The Cultana Solar Farm is … gearing up to start construction,” the company said this week in a social media post.
The Cultana project, being developed on an 1100-hectare site north of Whyalla on the Eyre Peninsula, received development approval in mid-May 2019. In 2020 the South Australian (SA) government signed a 10-year power purchase agreement with energy retailer ZEN Energy for the supply of renewable energy from the plant.
Construction of the project has however been repeatedly delayed with GFG under a financial microscope in recent years following the collapse of major backer Greensill.
In May last year, GFG announced it was looking to find a potential buyer or development partner for the Cultana project, but it now appears the company is pushing ahead with the development.
Simec has in recent weeks advertised a series of roles connected with the construction of the project which would be one of the largest solar farms in the state,
The company said the project site, to the north of GFG’s Whyalla Steelworks, is set to house 780,000 solar panels capable of generating 700GWh of energy per year, enough to power 100,000 homes.
Once construction is complete, the energy generated will contribute to the national electricity grid via the existing Cultana and Whyalla substations.
The project is also expected to play a part in GFG’s plans to modernize the Whyalla Steelworks, which is operated by GFG subsidiary Liberty Primary Metals Australia (L{MA}, by supplying it with low-cost renewable energy.
Although the steelworks will not have a direct behind-the-meter connection to the solar farm, the company has said it will have contracts in place that will effectively utilize the financial hedge that comes out of the solar farm.
Simec’s confirmation that it is preparing to commence construction of the Cultana Solar Farm follows the SA government’s announcement earlier this month it would provide a $50 million grant to co-finance efficiency projects at the Whyalla Steelworks.
LPMA steel executive managing director Jason Schell said the grant will fund approved projects to improve Whyalla’s productivity and efficiency, to be matched on a “dollar for dollar” basis by LPMA.
“The objective of the $50 million grant is to contribute to approved projects that aim to improve the productivity and efficiency of the Whyalla’s Integrated Steelworks,” he said.

Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced a bill, Connecting Hard-to-reach Areas with Renewable Energy (CHARGE), that is set to make critical changes to energy transmission planning and operations in support of a future powered by renewable energy.
As solar PV and wind projects join the nation’s electric grid, often in remote or rural areas, there is a lack of power lines to bring the power from distant generation sites to areas of high energy demand like cities. Across the country, the aging electric infrastructure will need to be rebuilt to serve this new class of electric generation.
Markey’s summary of the bill explained that the processes in place to plan and build transmission are fractured across many jurisdictions and shaped by incumbent utilities that lack a forward-looking, long-term strategy. Due to this, Markey said federal policy will be key to ensure proper planning and investment are in place.
“For the United States to run on green energy, we first need to build green infrastructure,” said Senator Markey. “Right now, the United States relies on two-lane roads for our electricity traffic when we need a renewable energy superhighway.”
The problem is already here
Arduous transmission upgrade problems have already hampered Markey’s home state of Massachusetts in achieving its renewable energy goals. About 679MW of solar projects have been trapped in a group study by utility National Grid to evaluate what transmission upgrades are needed to support the new capacity. Some projects have been stuck for three years and may be subject to as much as five more years of waiting for National Grid to approve interconnection of the project.
What’s more, there is a lack of transparency in how these upgrades are justified, and who bears the cost. In Massachusetts, in many cases, utility-scale solar developers are stuck footing the bill for significant utility transmission upgrades. In an interview with pv magazine, Jessica Robertson, Borrego Solar director of policy and business development, said “If we don’t have a new way of structuring cost allocation, the costs for all these projects will be prohibitive, and they will be cancelled.”
A letter to the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities warned that 6,800 jobs and $300 million in municipal revenues are exposed to damage from the upgrade costs and delays. This problem scaled from one small state to the entire country, plus interstate concerns, are motivating factors behind the CHARGE act.
What’s in the bill?
The CHARGE Act offers wide-ranging federal policy that introduces a series of reforms to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The bill:
The Act introduces measures for data transparency, which will tighten up the way utilities report their operations and expenses. The bill:
The Act has provisions for competition, fairness, and equity. The bill:
“The CHARGE Act lays the groundwork for an energy grid that can support an explosion of electric-powered vehicles and buildings, while also improving energy reliability, lowering costs for consumers, and spurring economic competition. My legislation will supply America with the tools and guidance needed to turn the clean energy revolution up a notch, accelerating our shift to true energy-independence that breaks our nation’s reliance on foreign oil from countries like Russia,” said Senator Markey.
