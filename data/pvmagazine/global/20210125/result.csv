Compared to a standard PV inverter with silicon transistors, the creators of this SiC device claim it eliminates the need for a 50 Hz transformer when PV installations are linked to medium-voltage networks.
The inverter was built with 3.3-kV SiC transistors that have lower power losses than standard silicon transistors. “This makes it possible to operate the inverter stack with a switching frequency of 16 kHz,” the Fraunhofer scientists specified. “With state-of-the-art silicon transistors, only about 10 times lower switching frequencies are possible in this voltage class.” According to the scientists, the device has a higher switching frequency, which results in a smaller format of the passive components.
Fraunhofer ISE's inverter was also equipped with an active liquid cooling technique, where a liquid synthetic ester is pumped into the device to cool the transistors. “At the same time, the cooling medium for the filter chokes serves as an electrical insulation medium, allowing the filter chokes to be made even more compact,” the researchers further explained.
The inverter runs at 98.4% efficiency and can be installed in a modular interconnection of multiple inverter stacks, which makes it ideal, according to its creators, for the deployment of systems at megawatt scale. “Taking into account additional installation space for switchgear and cooling unit, a volume saving of the inverter system of up to 40 percent can be achieved compared to commercial inverter systems of this voltage class,” the research institute stated.
These inverters, which the scientists define as “high-blocking SiC devices,” can have a wide range of applications in the medium-voltage range. “Especially for large photovoltaic power plants, the trend is towards higher and higher voltages,” affirmed Andreas Hensel, Head of Team Medium Voltage Power Electronics at Fraunhofer ISE.
Silicon carbide-based inverters are known for providing higher power density and having less need for cooling, which results in lower overall system costs than traditional inverters based on silicon transistors. However, defects at the interface between the silicon carbide and the insulating silicon dioxide material are still a major barrier to bringing the technology to mass production.
German inverter manufacturer Kaco new energy, a subsidiary of German industrial conglomerate Siemens, unveiled two SiC string inverters for applications in large-scale PV projects in December. Other inverter makers have thus far developed silicon carbide devices only as prototypes or in small-scale production runs.

First Solar is selling a 10 GW utility-scale solar project platform to Leeward Renewable Energy Development. The $261 million transaction is expected to close in the first quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.
Leeward is a portfolio company of OMERS Infrastructure, an investment arm of OMERS, one of Canada’s largest benefit pension plans.
The deal includes the Rabbitbrush, Madison, Oak Trail, Horizon, and Ridgely projects, which are expected to start construction in the United States in the next two years, and the 30 MW Barilla Solar project, which is operational.
The project pipeline includes projects in the California, Southwest, and Southeast markets. The sale of the platform is a result of a strategic review First Solar announced last year, said CEO Mark Widmar. The sale is part of a transition that is intended to enable the company to focus on scaling, developing, and selling module technology.
First Solar will retain 1.1 GW of projects in the U.S. that it said will be sold separately. Key members of the First Solar project development team are also expected to join Leeward upon closing.
Leeward also will buy 650 MW of First Solar’s Series 6 PV solar modules for its additional development opportunities. Leeward’s acquisition includes purchase orders for 888 MW of Series 6 modules for the five development projects.
Leeward’s acquisition will include 242 MW of Series 4 modules safe-harbored under the solar investment tax credit (ITC) program, 148 MW of which have previously been booked.
“This acquisition will support our aggressive growth strategy as a leading independent power producer and elevate Leeward’s prominent position in today’s energy market,” said Jason Allen, CEO of Leeward Renewable Energy.
The sale is subject to a number of closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approval from the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.
First Solar has 1.9 GW of annualized manufacturing capacity in Ohio and also operates manufacturing facilities in Vietnam and Malaysia. It produced 5.9 GW of Series 6 modules globally in 2020.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/25/trina-claims-3-energy-gain-with-new-tracking-system-over-traditional-trackers/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JANUARY 25, 2021",Trina claims 3% energy gain with new tracking system over traditional trackers,"Trina Solar, a module manufacturer with an in-house tracker manufacturer, launched a new single-axis tracker featuring a new algorithm that is not based on astronomical assumptions. Company information suggests that the revised tracking algorithm will produce a 3% additional energy gain over astronomical algorithms. 
The tracker is a bespoke solution for bifacial and large form factor modules with 182 mm or 210 mm wafers, the module manufacturer says. The TrinaTracker Vanguard 600+ series passed TÜV and UL certifications and thus conforms with IEC 62817 and UL 3703 standards. RWDI carried out wind tunnel testing to validate the trackers wind damage mitigation strategy. The product is ready to be shipped, with the first 600 MW project in cooperation with China's State Power Investment Corporation in the Qinghai-Henan region already in commercial operation since September 2020. 
A maximum of 120 modules can be mounted onto the Vanguard 600W+ series two-in-portrait tracker. Operations, maintenance and installation costs are reduced by easy to install and replaceable parts, and the third-generation spherical bearing improves stability. Trina adds that its new tracker also features a multi-point drive design to reduce structural failures caused by high wind loads. 
Traditionally, solar trackers feature an astronomical algorithm. By feeding the system the exact longitude and latitude of the tracker, the algorithm can predict the sun's precise position for each hour of a day each day of the year. The tracker then brings the module rows into such a position that they are in an azimuth position to the sun, which improves energy gain. 
When bifacial modules became the preferred choice, algorithms didn't change. It was assumed that optimizing the front side would provide a more significant yield and that optimizing the rear side was nearly impossible. Project owners would take what they get from the rear. Optimization happened more on the structural side, avoiding uneven shading from posts and purlins, for example. 
But the research question remained. “Are there any circumstances where energy gain can be increased by also optimizing the algorithm to calculate rear-side generation?” Trina claims so with its new SuperTrack algorithm, which is not astronomical and for which China General Certification certified a 3.08% gain over traditional astronomical algorithms. The SuperTrack algorithm relies on “deep-learning” of high-diffuse irradiance weather conditions and power generation characteristics of bifacial modules to determine the optimal pitch to maximize energy gain. 
It should be noted, however, that according to the white paper that Trina published to detail its energy gains from the SuperTrack algorithm, these gains are only achieved during cloudy conditions. The charts provided in the white paper suggest that power generation during sunny conditions is mostly consistent with that of astronomical algorithm trackers. The Vanguard 600+ Series's press information also indicates that the tracker would give an energy gain extra of 2-8% in scattered irradiation conditions. 
Trina adds that the algorithm brings the modules into a horizontal position during cloudy conditions. That this is the preferred mode of tracking during such conditions is unquestioned. Some other manufacturers relying on astronomical algorithms have made their trackers react that way, hence not following astronomical tracking when it's an overcast day. It is unclear whether the Trina solution achieves the 3% gain over these solutions as well. 
During sunny periods energy gain is on par with astronomical algorithms. Additionally, Trina says it has improved its backtracking algorithm to become a “smart” backtracking algorithm. Backtracking is another mode of tracking in which trackers stop following perfect azimuth positions but assume lower pitch positions to avoid inter-row shading. The theory behind this is that module mismatch losses resulting from inter-row shading results are more significant than the optimal azimuth gains during sunset and sunrise. 
“TrinaTracker is one of the core components of Trina Solar's overall smart energy solutions,” said Duan Shunwei, head of the tracker business unit at Trina Solar. “In 2020 Trina Solar's global shipments of trackers exceeded 2 GW. This year Trina Solar's self-owned production capacity for trackers is expected to reach 7 GW, 70% of these new trackers applicable to 600W+ ultra-high power modules.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/25/total-leaves-american-petroleum-institute/,"MARKETS,FRANCE",JOËL SPAES,"JANUARY 25, 2021",Total leaves American Petroleum Institute,"From pv magazine France
French oil group Total annually evaluates its participation in major industry organizations in order to ensure their alignment with its positions on climate change. In November 2019, it published its climate strategy and indicated that it was exiting the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers association, for example. And now, it is leaving the American Petroleum Institute (API).
Total focuses on several key points. One is adherence to the scientific consensus that there is a proven link between human activity and climate change. It also assesses trade bodies for the support of the Paris Agreement, among other considerations.
At the end of its 2019 and 2020 reviews, Total's position on API was that it was “partially aligned” with its own objectives. However, it criticized API for its position on the role of natural gas and its role in the Transportation Fairness Alliance, which is opposed to supporting electric vehicles. On the issue of carbon pricing, API also diverges from Total's positions.
“API gave its support during the recent elections to candidates who argued against the United States’ participation in the Paris Agreement,” Total said.
Total CEO Patrick Pouyanné said that the company remains committed to ensuring that the industry associations it works with are aligned with its own efforts to fight climate change.
“This transparency responds to our stakeholders' expectations, as well as being an essential guarantee of the credibility of our strategy,” Pouyanné added.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/25/bangladesh-forms-125-million-fund-for-sustainable-technology/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,ASIA,BANGLADESH",SYFUL ISLAM,"JANUARY 25, 2021",Bangladesh forms $125 million fund for sustainable technology,"Bangladesh’s central bank has formed a US$125 million revolving fund to finance technology development and support the country's export-oriented industry, including the import of renewable energy-related machinery and technology.
The refinancing scheme from the central bank is also available to upgrade machinery for waste, water, wind and heat management in factories.
One of the primary aims of of the fund is to enhance capacity, sustainability, environment-friendly, and energy efficient production in factories.
The low cost scheme will charge entrepreneurs up to 5% interest at the highest. The state-owned banks and private commercial banks will disburse the funds among company owners that have successfully applied for refinancing scheme loans.
A senior central bank official told pv magazine that in line with the sustainable development goals many Bangladeshi entrepreneurs are now setting up green factories for energy efficiency and also using renewable energy to run their establishments.
The new fund will help them acquire the latest renewable energy-related machinery and technologies for their green factories.
The official said the new refinancing fund was established following the creation of a policy making it easier for banks and financial institutions to offer sustainable financing as part of the government’s efforts to achieve global sustainable development goals.
Under the policy the banks and financial institutions were asked to disburse at least 2% of their annual loans for green financing, which include renewable energy and effluent treatment plants, among others.
Dipal C. Barua, president of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, hailed the refinancing scheme and making the funding available for renewable energy related machinery and technologies.
“Many local entrepreneurs are interested in setting up solar module factories here jointly with world renowned companies. The new scheme will help us to transfer technology if we can secure funding from there,” he said.
Mr. Barua said the low cost fund would be a big help in expanding the use of renewable energy related products and technology in Bangladesh.
He expressed hope that the efforts would one day result in most of the people in the country using renewable power and products on a daily basis.
Presently Bangladesh produces 716.65 megawatts of electricity from renewabales, while a number of solar power plants are scheduled to come online this year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/25/how-end-user-subsidies-can-help-achieve-universal-energy-access/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,ASIA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA",COSMAS MWIRIGI,"JANUARY 25, 2021",How end-user subsidies can help achieve universal energy access,"GOGLA, the global association for the off-grid solar energy industry, released an off-grid solar discussion paper on Jan. 15 highlighting the possible interventions solar industry players can adopt to increase energy access and affordability.
GOGLA interviewed 25 off-grid solar companies active in the underserved African and South Asian markets, and compiled their views in the paper.
Companies that took part in the interview include those selling multi-light kits, solar lanterns, irrigation systems, home systems, and off-grid appliances. The paper aims to further the discussion on how end-user subsidies (as one of the possible interventions) could fit within the framework of public financing solutions to accelerate energy access.
We've compiled a summary report on what the discussion paper entails, adding our own commentary.
Energy Access Interventions
The paper introduces three ways in which industry players can make the off-grid solar products more affordable for the less fortunate in the energy-poor markets and reduce the cost of reaching and servicing these customers.
1. Enabling environment interventions: For example, working closely with government bodies to ensure favorable policies for off-grid solar, e.g., providing tax exemptions and consumer protection using quality standards.
2. Supply-Side Subsidies: Use of grants and financing facilities such as results-based financing (RBF) to lower the cost or risk of reaching customers in the most remote and challenging markets.
3. End User Subsidies: These are ways meant to reduce the cost of off-grid products or services by directly targeting the poorest customers. Voucher schemes and cash-transfers were identified under this category.
Choosing the Right Energy Access Intervention Schemes for the Deserving Markets
Off-grid solar companies should use the right energy access intervention schemes to target energy-poor homes and businesses at scale.
According to the discussion paper, the type of subsidy to be used depends largely on: the target population, the state of the market, and the specific barrier to energy access that the subsidy schemes aim to address.
For industry players to choose the right intervention, the market should be segmented into the following categories:
1. Commercial markets: These are businesses, large and small, using off-grid solar products, e.g., shops that use solar refrigerators.
2. Non-commercial markets: These are customers using off-grid products in their households without a direct economic benefit, e.g., families using solar lanterns to light their homes.
The above market segments can be classified further into two categories:
3. Financially challenged markets: Here, the customers are unable to pay for off-grid solar products.
4. Logistically challenged markets: Businesses or households that are not within the commercial geographical reach fall under this category.
Mixing and matching the categories above gives four market types. The paper further identifies the most suitable tools to use to ensure universal energy access. The table below, as presented in the discussion paper, provides a market segmentation summary.

From the classification above, and according to the discussion paper, supply-side subsidies are effectively used to reach customers in logistically challenged markets. This scheme allows companies to operate in remote areas that are otherwise inaccessible without a subsidy.
Examples highlighted include:
(i) KOSAP scheme in Kenya (a US$150 million results-based financing, or RBF, and debt facility – supported by the World Bank – that targets 14 of the 47 counties in Kenya).
(ii) Beyond the Grid Fund in Zambia (a €20 million multi-year RBF aiming to increase energy access, improve livelihoods and catalyze economic activity in rural and peri-urban areas).
End-user subsidies were recommended in markets that are easily accessible but where the customers cannot afford the off-grid solar products. A combination of supply-side and end-user subsidies was also shown to be more effective for poorer customers in the non-commercial markets.
A case study highlighted in the paper is Rwanda's Energising Development (EnDev), where supply-side subsidies through an RBF proved to be inefficient, hence the need to introduce an end-user subsidy. This combination has then provided off-grid solar products to 31,000 households that were initially locked out by the one-sided subsidy scheme.
Possible Risks Created by End-User Subsidies
Several companies that took part in the interview pointed out some key concerns that could arise if end-user subsidies were not planned and appropriately administered. One major problem is the potential to introduce market distortions, which, in a worst-case scenario, could slow down or even reverse the efforts put in place to drive universal energy access.
The following two examples were cited as the possible causes of market distortions, as far as end-user subsidies are concerned:
1. A case where the reasons for and benefits of running end-user subsidy schemes are not well communicated to the off-grid population leading to misinformation and change in customer behaviors. A further example is when there's a risk of existing customers who paid the full price defaulting on off-grid products due to perceived price discrimination.
2. Subsidy scheme that lack a clear exit strategy make it difficult for companies to ensure market sustainability. In other words, it's a question of whether the customers will continue to embrace the particular off-grid solar solutions once the subsidy is withdrawn.
Mitigating the Market Distortion Risks Caused by End-User Subsidies
To address the possible challenges caused by end-user subsidies, the discussion paper approaches the solutions in four ways:
• Building business certainty and clarity
• Ensuring a holistic and flexible implementation
• Forging a path to stakeholder alignment and engagement
• Working on market sustainability
We've further discussed each of the solutions below.
Business Certainty and Clarity
Business clarity and certainty are vital to ensuring that the off-grid solar industry effectively reaches more energy-poor households.
As one c-suite leader from an unidentified company that participated in the interview put it: “The greater clarity and certainty a program can provide, the more chance we have to build effective and sustainable business models that can create impact.”
To help create certainty and clarity, five actions are proposed:
1. Expanding the program size and duration
Several companies suggested that large subsidies in the range of US$50-300 million would allow them to create long-term business models and distribution infrastructure to reach lower-income customer groups. A three-to-five-year duration for running the program was also shown to be more impactful than a one-to-two-year subsidy program.
2. Working with simple, efficient, and precise administrative processes
The need for an efficient administration is discussed, where companies cited that too much administration and strict rules increases overheads and would make the program unattractive.
3. Ensuring strong fund management and timely disbursements
Delayed disbursements have been cited in the discussion paper, with one company quoting that they often can't count on such funds. Most companies also stressed the need for a trusted third-party fund manager or implementation partner to be involved in the scheme to ensure funds are administered effectively.
4. Adopting a clear and appropriate approach to targeting
Each of the three techniques: geographic, demographic, and economic status-based targeting was discussed. Two unidentified companies suggested a non-targeted end-user subsidy scheme citing that donors and governments would see maximum ROI in terms of impact per dollar spent.
However, most interviewees were convinced that targeting has worked in the energy sector in different economies; hence it should work for the off-grid solar industry. As one company cited in the paper noted: “Subsidies have been instrumental in scaling energy technologies all over the world. The conversation is not new; it is a tried a tested method in many different areas. As the off-grid solar sector, we can learn from that; we shouldn't reinvent the wheel.”
5. Creating a simple and streamlined verification process
Digital platforms were identified as low-cost and effective options for tracking and verifying where the subsidies are going and their impact. However, it was noted that some of these technologies are not applicable for use with all products, and this could limit the participation of individual companies.
Holistic and Flexible Implementation
To ensure appropriate and optimal use of public funding, companies recommended the adoption of the following three initiatives:
Evaluation of key market dynamics
Several factors affecting the off-grid solar market should be considered before settling for any end-user subsidy scheme.
The paper highlighted a possible disconnect rising from the two main objectives for deploying end-user subsidy – the need to establish a sustainable market and that of rapidly reaching the poorest customers. As one company stated:
“It can be dangerous to implement an end-user subsidy in markets that are not mature. It can attract companies that are only interested in benefiting from the subsidy, not in creating a sustainable market. I feel that it takes at least five years for a market to get to the point where end-user subsidies make sense.”
Other schemes should be considered alongside end-user subsidies.
Instead of focusing only on end-user subsidy as a way to boost universal energy access, off-grid industry players should pay keen attention to the other intervention schemes to fully address market barriers.
An example is the KOSAP end-user subsidy program, which was all good until the Kenyan government reinstated 16% VAT. The company had to pass the cost of taxation back to the customer — again making the products less affordable.
Having In-build Flexibility in an End-User Subsidy Program
For end-user programs running for several years, the scheme should be agile enough to respond to the changing market conditions.
One company illustrated this with an example of an end-user subsidy scheme that aimed to supply solar fridges, but just before the program launched, the product had already been commoditized, and the whole project was compromised.
Stakeholder Alignment
Off-grid solar companies agreed that to help design favorable subsidy criteria for all the parties involved, the following four measures should be put into place:
Maximize engagement to ensure effective program design
All the stakeholders involved in a subsidy program should work closely to ensure commitment to roles and responsibilities and effectively develop long-term partnerships.
Like the other challenges discussed, one company cited an example of conflicting goals and views among the stakeholders: “Governments have a short-term focus. Ministries often need to show progress in one year, and donors do not fully understand that. We sometimes see that a donor country lead never even met the minster of energy, and the private sector can get stuck in between. We also see that large donors can be quite territorial; they only support schemes they designed themselves, even if they have big flaws. This needs to change.”
Ensure transparency and accountability
Several companies recommended having an independent third-party fund manager to avoid misappropriation of funds or people taking advantage of weak systems for personal gains.
Kenya's KOSAP scheme was a cited case study where Kenya's Ministry of Energy contracted SNV, a non-profit based in the Netherlands, to manage the second phase of the program. SNV managed the RBF component but subcontracted SunFunder, a leading fund manager for solar energy investment in Sub Saharan Africa, to oversee the debt fund.
Digital tools cited earlier would also blend in to help increase transparency. For example, they can be used to monitor disbursements and track and show the project's progress.
Recognizing tension in subsidy design
One company highlighted the need to have a win-win strategy when allocating subsidy schemes to ensure that the smaller companies aren't sidelined.
“Subsidies are often given to larger companies who don't need it that much. I understand that we try to maximize impact by giving money to established companies, but in the end, this creates monopolies. It should be possible for smaller and local companies to participate; these schemes are also an opportunity to develop the local economy.”
Clear Communication with Customers
Companies stressed the importance of educating the off-grid population on the importance of subsidy programs to avoid misinformation and change in customer behavior.
Information on eligibility criteria, the available products, and even the program's duration will ensure that everyone understands the scheme's objectives and what to expect during and after the subsidy.
Market Sustainability
As highlighted earlier, a solid exit strategy is key to building a sustainable market. Several companies also noted that besides all the great efforts, off-grid solar products sold should be long-lasting and high-quality to build customer trust and ensure sustainability. Another solution is to focus on connections as well as after-sales.
“I feel uncomfortable with just focusing on the connection,” one company representative added. “We also need to focus on after-sales, and make sure customers are happy with their product two, three, four years later.”

In the study Modelling and analysis of the influence of solar spectrum on the efficiency of photovoltaic modules, published in Energy Reports, the researchers proposed a method to obtain the characteristics for solar radiation spectra in variable weather conditions without the need for expensive and sophisticated measurement devices. This model, in their view, can represent a low-cost solution to estimate how changes in the solar radiation spectrum distribution can have an impact on the properties of various photovoltaic modules.
Their analysis was performed through the SolarSpectrum, which is a spectrum simulator used to measure the influence of changes in the solar radiation spectral distribution. The simulation took into consideration the geographic coordinates of the study location, the local atmospheric conditions, the solar time, season of the year, azimuth, and the PV module slope exposition.
These data were then compared with those resulting from the simulation made with other simulators such as the Smarts2, Spectal2, Modrtran, and Brite models. “The obtained measurement results are mean values, with variable measurement intervals, to provide the solar radiation spectrum covering all the elements crucial for the analysis of the photovoltaic conversion present in the PV modules, such as location and size of the absorption holes in the spectrum characteristic,” the academics specified, adding that the spectral simulation error was within 5%.
The analyses showed that PV modules relying on crystalline silicon and copper indium selenide (CIS) cell technologies may be better suitable to deal with the impact of solar spectra in projects with tracking systems, for which the conversion of direct radiation is of crucial importance, according to the Polish group.
Single and multijunction thin-film modules based on amorphous silicon, and eventually CIS products, are indicated as the best option for stationary projects without tracking systems or BIPV projects on facades, where the conversion of diffuse radiation play a particular role. “Theoretical analysis of the a-Si structures, both single as well multijunction, shows better performance of these devices at low irradiance conditions, during days characterized by spectral distribution common for cloudy days with large water vapor content in the air,” the authors of the papers stated. “These types of device should exhibit unchanged efficiency both at midday as well as during morning and late afternoon.”
The reported fluctuations in the module efficiency are the result of the change of the solar radiation stream falling on the exposition plane, the researchers noted. The choice of the optimum semiconductor material for operation in a PV system should depend on its capability to work in irradiance conditions characterized by various diffuse radiation contents, they added.

There are currently 385 projects totaling 15 GW at different stages of development in Colombia, including four biomass installations, 17 wind farms, 93 hydropower dams, and 271 solar arrays, according to the UPME. The 271 solar projects have a combined capacity of 8,855 MW. The country's second renewable-energy auction, which will be open to large-scale PV projects, has been scheduled for the first quarter of next year.

“The CP3 power module has been tested … at an operating temperature of over 150 C and promises to have a 37-year lifecycle with little degradation,” Crystal Green Energy CEO Gilles Leduc told pv magazine. “The power module and the optical components will be manufactured in North America and shipped to Congo facilities for assembly to reduce cost in shipping and to bring forward this technology.”
The company used CPV cells with an active area of 6.5 mm x 6.5 mm and an efficiency of about 40% at 100 suns. The cells were assembled into the DBC carriers via a commercial solder die-attach process.
“The power module assembly with the CPV cell solder process is a cost-effective solution to reduce the price of manufacturing,” Leduc explained. “Our design can incorporate the future developments of a higher efficient tandem cell structure.”
Each cell features an indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) subcell, a gallium arsenide (GaAs) middle cell incorporating indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) quantum dots, and a bottom cell based on germanium (Ge). The cells were manufactured by Azastra, a Canadian supplier of optoelectronic devices, via the QDec measurement system. QDec complies with the IEC 6210 standard, which is used to shape quality control for mirror panels in solar concentrators such as parabolic troughs, heliostats and dishes.
The scientists used modular quad receivers equipped with anodes and cathode connectors to protect the individual CPV cells and to easily interconnect the modules into the panel assembly. The CPV system also integrates a Cassegrain beam expander for initial energy concentration and a Winston cone light concentrator for final energy concentration.
“Our design uses a light weight polymer with an efficiency of 98.5 % reflectivity molded quad primary and secondary mirror that reduces the cost of manufacturing,” Leduc explained. “The Winston cone also reduces the cost and assembly process.”
They placed a heat exchanger beneath each carrier to prevent cell damage and reduce heat exchange to a hot water tank that can be used for domestic hot water and floor heating requirements in commercial applications.
“This off-axis configuration allows arranging the optics in a rotationally symmetric pattern, which in turn sets up the CPV cell assembly to be configured on a common substrate at the centre of this multisystem,” Leduc added.
The CPV modules can be assembled in a fully flexible power configuration and can be wired in full series.
“While the material costs such as DBC carriers will still increase approximately linearly with the number of cells, the assembly cost will be almost independent of the number of discrete components in a commercial die attach process,” Leduc explained.
The DBC carriers are made from gold plated copper on each side of an alumina ceramic less than 1mm thick based on an industrial process.
The two companies are now working on potential applications for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings.

From 1868 to 2006, the Gowings department store was a cornerstone of Sydney life. Last week, the investment company Gowing Bros, which has existed in parallel for much of that time, became a cornerstone investor in LAVO, an Australian “lifestyle company” that is developing domestic hydrogen energy-storage tech.
In partnership with the University of New South Wales’ hydrogen research facility, LAVO has produced the world’s first residential-commercial hydrogen battery. It stores 40 kWh of energy – three times the capacity of a Tesla Powerwall 2, at 13.5 kWh. And it has the potential to reshape how rooftop solar-generated energy is stored for use when the sun goes down, or when the grid grinds into blackout.
Alan Yu, CEO and executive director of LAVO, says that the system is “the culmination of decades of research.” Engineering and design specialist GHD, fuel-cell technologists Nedstack, and Australian industrial design consultancy D+I contributed to its development.
“Having Gowings on board is a huge vote of confidence in the work that we are doing,” said Yu.
Last year, LAVO’s energy storage mechanism was still being refined in the lab. In early 2021, it is available for use, in an attractively engineered unit.
LAVO has already secured orders from ventures such as an eco lodge and Gowing Bros, ahead of its official installation-ready date in June. As part of its investment in LAVO, Gowings has committed to purchasing 200 LAVO units, to be deployed at its various commercial properties, such as shopping centers.
“In addition to providing our retail tenants cost savings on energy across Gowings shopping centres, we see a major opportunity to become our own retailer of power at our residential developments through the use of LAVO technology to underpin an embedded network,” said John Gowing, managing director of Gowings.
The LAVO is about the size of a domestic fridge, with dimensions 1680 x 1240 x 400 mm, and weighing 324 kg. At installation, it is connected to a solar PV system via a (hybrid) inverter, and to mains water via a purification system. This will allow internal electrolyzers to convert excess energy into hydrogen, which it stores in four canisters.
