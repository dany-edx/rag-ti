The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) warned that tariffs on imported panels from three Asian countries would jeopardize nearly 30% of the solar capacity the U.S. is expected to install over the next two years.
The Commerce Department could decide in early October whether to launch a trade investigation into solar cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. Those countries account for 80% of all panel imports into the United States.
In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, the SEIA said the duties – proposed by an anonymous group of domestic manufacturers last month – would be devastating to the growth of the renewable energy sector.
“I cannot overstate the dire threat that these reckless petitions are imposing on hundreds of thousands of American families,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO in a statement. She said the petitioners are asking Commerce to “misinterpret U.S. law” and “overturn a decade of department decisions” in solar trade cases. “We urge Commerce to use its discretion and dismiss these frivolous petitions.”

Hero, part of the Haryana-based Hero Motors Co bike and scooter manufacturing group, will partner with Panamanian-registered investment company Business Research International Corporation on the solar project, which could represent the first Indian investment in utility scale solar in Bangladesh.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
The cabinet committee on public purchase of Bangladesh today approved a 20-year power purchase agreement for the solar field, which will set a tariff of $0.1025/kWh for the electricity generated, for a total bill to the exchequer of an estimated $157 million
Hero will have to fund the acquisition of land to host the 486-acre project, plus a 17km power line and electricity sub-station, with grid access restrictions having forced Hero Future Energies to halve the scale of what was originally intended to be a 100 MW plant.
With Chinese president Xi Jinping having today told the UN General Assembly his nation will no longer fund overseas coal-fired power projects, Bangladeshi officials have claimed the government in Dhaka has recently scrapped plans for 10 proposed coal plants, for reasons including their environmental impact.
With Bangladesh hosting just 766.8 MW of renewables generation capacity at present, the government wants 40% of the nation's energy to come from clean power plants by 2041.
Hero Future Energies, on its website, claims to have a 1.2 GW solar and wind power portfolio with a further 1.5 GW planned or under construction. Having announced an ambition of having 5 GW of installed capacity online next year, Hero says it has developed 500 MW of large scale solar in European and Asian nations including Bangladesh, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia and the U.K.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/22/novel-technique-to-prevent-fires-in-lithium-ion-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,SINGAPORE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2021",Novel technique to prevent fires in lithium-ion batteries,"Scientists from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore), have developed a novel technology that they claim is able to prevent internal short-circuits in lithium-ion batteries.
These short-circuits still represent a major hurdle to overcome for battery makers, as lithium-ion devices can catch fire if they are damaged or not properly manufactured. What causes these short-circuits, the research team explained, is the formation of dendrites, which are needle-like projections that can grow inside a battery and cause a number of undesirable effects, including, in a worst-case scenario, complete battery failure and even fires. The dendrites cross the separator between the positive cathode and negative anode electrodes of a lithium-ion battery during charging.
In order to prevent the dendrites from reaching the cathode, the academics placed what they called an “anti-short layer” on the separator itself. “Instead of preventing the formation of dendrites, we decided to make use of their intrinsic properties by coating an additional layer of conductive material on the separator for these dendrites to connect with,” said NTU researcher Jason Xu. “Once the dendrites make the connection, [they] will not be able to continue their growth further, thus preventing them from ever reaching the other side.”
The additional layer works as an interface on behalf of the negative electrode to exchange lithium-ions with the positive electrode. It was tested on more than 50 cells with different li-ion battery architectures and, according to the scientists, no short-circuits arose during the charging phase, even with the battery cells that exceeded their expected lifecycle. “The anti-short layer is a common material used in battery manufacturing and can be easily integrated into the current separator manufacturing process, making it easy for companies to adopt and scale up,” the Singaporean group stated, noting that it would increase lithium battery production costs by around 5%.
NTU University's spin-off NTUitive is planning to bring this novel technology to commercial production and is currently in the process of securing a patent.

Strip cropping consists of cultivating narrow, developed, and undeveloped field strips with the aim of reducing erosion by water and wind. This method is particularly widespread in the regions where soil and wind erosion lead to the erosion of the fertile soil surface. It is also used when the slope is too steep, runs too long or other cultivation methods cannot prevent soil erosion or wind erosion.
The research project will include a 0.7 MW pilot agrivoltaic plant near Almere, in the Netherlands' northern province of Flevoland. “We will test the system and the business models,” Vattenfall's head of Solar Development NL, Annemarie Schouten, told pv magazine. “We want to investigate the possibilities to increase the rollout of such systems. These technologies are combined with lane farming, a biodiverse and ecological way of farming, where no pesticides have to be used.”
The demonstrator solar plant, called Symbizon, will be built with single-axis trackers and bifacial modules placed at a height of 2.3 m. “We will use a smart tracking algorithm to search for the optimal point for both the crop growth and energy production,” Schouten stated. “Moreover, the turning modules ensure a non-static shading which is expected to be better for the crops.” Strip farming with various crops will be alternated with strips with solar panels, which will make the site accessible for agricultural machines.
In the solar strips, the consortium wants to cultivate herbs, as these normally need less light. “For the pilot in Almere we will use two different row distances of 13 and 7 m, respectively,” Schouten further explained. This safety distance is used for multiple reasons and most importantly to avoid water runoff in the herb strip, she added, pointing out that extensive water runoff from the modules can harm the crops. Next to the pilot plant, the research team has planned a reference field where no PV modules will be installed.
Other crops, such as potatoes, beans, beetroot, broccoli and grains, may be included in the pilot. “We will have to take into account the height of the crops and assess what the influence of shade on the crop growth will be,” Shouten added, noting that there is always a competition for light in these systems, as light is needed for both the plant photosynthesis and energy production. “The biggest challenge here is to assess what the optimal position of the panels will be in each stage of the growth process of the crops, without compromising the electricity yield,” she added.
The research project has a four-year duration and the agrivoltaic facility is planned to come online in the spring of 2022.
In August, the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) presented a new approach for building east-west oriented solar parks, which it claimed can prevent soil deterioration and offer the same yield as south-oriented PV plants.
A month later, a group of scientists at Utrecht University in the Netherlands assessed the effects of south-oriented, large scale PV plants on vegetation, soil, and microclimate in 13 solar parks in the Netherlands and found that a distance between panel rows of at least 1.5 times panel height is crucial to create the best environmental conditions.

The €7.4 million program will be funded through the European Economic Area Financial Mechanism 2014-2021 and rebates will cover up to 85% of the costs for buying and installing a PV system.
Businesses and homeowners will have time until November 29 to submit their project proposals.
According to European photovoltaic association SolarPower Europe, Croatia is aiming to reach 300 MW of distributed generation capacity by 2030 and is expecting PV to develop at this pace thanks to a tax exemption of self-consumed electricity, direct marketing, and a program for PV in buildings. It is also planning to introduce new rules for renewable energy communities.
The Croatian authorities are also currently holding a series of tenders for large-scale renewables. In the first procurement exercise held in December 2020, Croatian electricity and gas regulator Hrvatski Operator Tržišta Energije allocated around 25 MW of renewable energy capacity.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Croatia had 85 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2020. Croatia implemented a FIT scheme for rooftop solar that expired in 2015 after bringing online around 50 MW of capacity.

Pick up your copy of the September edition of pv magazine today for a detailed update on solar and battery storage in the United States, which faces a tough decision between taking advantage of Asian imports, or developing domestic manufacturing at the risk of slowing progress towards decarbonization.
The start-up had initially planned to deliver its prototype to customers last year, however manufacturing was delayed and the start of deliveries is now set for next summer.
To reserve a Lightyear One, deep-pocketed customers will have to pay a €150,000 fee described as a “down payment” on the company's website, suggesting the final purchase price will be even higher.
Lightyear has also successfully generated investment by offering shareholders the opportunity of reserving one of the vehicles, which features a solar panel roof.
Lightyear's website claims the prototype will “consume only 83 Wh/km – two to three times less energy than any other electric vehicle on the market,” and adds, the company aims to manufacture 946 cars, to be delivered in the European Union, Norway and Switzerland.
The Lightyear One’s 5m² roof consists of a double-curved, glass-covered solar panel backed with maximum power point trackers.

Francisco Retamal: ENGIE has plans to develop 2 GW of renewable energy capacity in Chile, and to cease its coal-fired power generation activities in the whole of Latin America by 2025. This presents an additional 1 GW since the last announcement in 2019. A big portion of this renewable energy capacity will be solar.
Alongside our transformation plan, we have developed a couple of rooftop photovoltaic systems at client sites, accompanying these clients through their own energy transition. For these projects, we have already used Huawei string inverters, learning the advantages of this technology.
String inverter technology is always the best option for rooftop projects because it has easy installation, and if one string fails, the whole array’s energy is not lost, just the power from that string. Maintenance is also simple, and you can reduce the amount of DC cabling needed. We also used Huawei string inverters in a project at Santiago’s Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport: 720 kW string inverter capacity from 14 inverters, which generate around 1.2 GWh per year of renewable energy. This project adds on to recent similar agreements with different companies for a total inverter capacity of around 1,100 kW.
ENGIE is working with central inverters for its latest utility-scale project in Chile, but the aforementioned advantages of string technology can also play out in larger projects. And given our experience in rooftop projects, we’re considering string inverter technology for utility-scale project designs.
Julio Saintard: String inverters offer a high level of redundancy and plant availability; in case one of the inverters goes down, the rest of the plant continues to operate at a high-capacity level. From the installation point of view, considering that the packaging size of a string inverter is much smaller than a central one, the transport from the factory, unloading, and its disposition of the work is made easier, requiring less specialized equipment and fewer hours of labor. This optimizes execution times and reduces the risk for the project.
JS: Most of the large photovoltaic plants are located in the desert regions of northern Chile, where the “chusca” is abundant. This is a kind of dust with very small granulometry, that requires components rated with at least IP65 protection, as well as a comprehensive maintenance plan to be carried out according to the specific site conditions. Site selection is also relevant in terms of corrosivity – many areas of northern Chile reach the ‘C5 – very high’ classification, based on the ISO standards. Finally, the size and flexibility that a site has for mounting systems also have implications in terms of required earthworks and the need for seismic certifications.
Christopher Llanos: It is one of the options that we are considering. Project feasibility for any technology will depend mainly on the LCOE of the overall project, taking into account the advantages on opex, capex, and yield of the complete project can have.
FR: We have received solid customer service from Huawei, based on strong knowledge of string inverters and clear communication for solving problems and supporting ENGIE with different post-sales requirements. In addition, we have had a very positive experience with Huawei’s monitoring platform, which gives us the opportunity to watch our PV systems operating in real-time.
FR: It is possible, but it will depend on the market and on how the economic variables of the project between one solution to another move, and their impacts on the overall cost of the project.

India reached a cumulative installed rooftop solar capacity of 6.1 GW at the end of June 2021 with the addition of 521 MW rooftop PV in the second quarter (Q2) of the year. The Q2 2021 addition is a 53% increase compared to 341 MW installed in Q1 2021, and India’s highest-ever rooftop solar capacity installed in a quarter, according to Mercom India Research’s Rooftop Solar Market Report Q2 2021.
Installations were significantly higher than the previous quarter despite the second wave of COVID-19 and related state lockdowns. The report cited targeted lockdowns and industry preparedness as the factors reducing the impact on installation activity this time around.
With the Q2 addition, rooftop solar installations in the first half of the year reached 862 MW, surpassing the total rooftop solar capacity installed in all of 2020, 719 MW, when the market was severely affected by COVID-19 lockdowns. 
According to the report, 2021 could turn out to be the second-largest year for rooftop solar after 2018 if the market has no other adverse COVID-related events for the rest of the year.
“The rooftop solar segment had a strong quarter, and demand is up,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. “Finalizing the net metering cap at 500 kW has removed uncertainty for installers and paved the way for future growth. However, haphazard rooftop solar policies across states and a lack of support from distribution companies are holding back the sector from realizing its true potential to bring in new investment, create jobs and drive the clean energy economy forward.”
The Indian state of Gujarat led the rooftop solar installations in Q2, followed by Maharashtra and Haryana.

In the procurement exercise, which is the eighth round of the country's auction scheme for large-scale renewables, the energy regulator allocated 775 MW of PV capacity, 1,851 MW of wind power, and 96 MW of hydropower capacity.
The auction concluded with an average price of RUB 5.18 ($0.070)/kWh. The lowest bid for solar technology was RUB 4.33 ($0.059)/kWh and that for wind power was RUB 1.717/kWh. The lowest offer for hydropower was RUB 7.68/kWh.
The JSC ATS reviewed 100 project proposals for wind power, 89 for solar PV, and three for hydropower.
Selected solar projects are due to come online in 2023 and 2024, while wind projects are scheduled to become operational between 2025 and 2027. Hydropower projects should begin selling power to the grid between 2027 and 2028.
“The average bid for solar is down nearly 64% on the minimum bid seen in the country’s previous solar auction,” Anton Usachev, president of the Russian Solar Energy Association, told pv magazine. “This is attributed to local content requirements that since 2014 have led to establishing several cell and module manufacturing facilities, inverter and mounting structures production.”
In the seventh round of the scheme, held in June 2019, three projects, with generation capacities of 5.6-6 MW, were pre-qualified for a 5.6 MW capacity procurement and Finnish utility Fortum secured the only PV project selected. The average bidding price was around RUB 62,000 ($821) per megawatt installed. The capex figure offered by solar developers was lower than that for 71 MW of wind power allocated and lower than for previous PV projects.
The previous auction round, held in June 2018, saw Russian module manufacturer Hevel Group and Fortum win the 148.5 MW worth of solar PV projects awarded.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Russia had 1,428 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2020. The country is also supporting rooftop PV via a newly introduced net metering scheme.
Russia has the potential to almost double its 2030 solar capacity target to 5 GW. Although the nation is not regarded as a country with high solar radiation, IRENA said southern regions such as Dagestan and Altai could host large scale PV plants “likely to perform as efficiently as in southern Italy”.

Edify Energy’s project is the first development application to be formally approved by the Townsville City Council for the planned Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct, which aims to co-locate clean energy generation with industrial and manufacturing facilities across more than 2000 hectares of dedicated land 40 kilometers south of Townsville.
Edify plans to initially produce green hydrogen at the site with a 10 MW pilot facility before increasing capacity in stages “to meet the needs of a growing domestic and export green hydrogen market,” it said. 
The company is also in the development stages of building its 200 MW Majors Creek Solar Power Station, which will supply electricity to the Lansdown facility.
Edify has not yet released capacity or chemistry details about the battery storage facility it is also planning to build at the site though.

The formal approval marks the first stage in the precinct’s development and was warmly welcomed by both Edify and Townsville’s Mayor Jenny Hill. “The momentum continues to build behind the development of northern Australia’s first environmentally sustainable, advanced manufacturing, processing and technology estate right here in Townsville,” Cr Hill said in a statement.
According to her, Edify’s application had been independently assessed by the council’s planning officers and approved with conditions relating to development staging, roadworks and traffic safety upgrades.
Edify is one of three companies Townsville City Council said had “signed up to establish themselves at the precinct.”
Queensland Pacific Minerals plans to produce battery-grade nickel and cobalt sulphate from a nickel-cobalt ore. Imperium3 Townsville (iM3TSV), the third company looking to join, is seeking to develop an 18 GWh lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing facility, according to the council.

Mayor Hill said the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct had the potential to significantly boost Townsville and North Queensland’s economy for decades.
“Lansdown is really significant to the city with the potential for thousands of jobs to be created which would be a huge boost to our economy and bring new skills to the community, particularly when the local economy is recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic,” Cr Hill said.
“We welcome the state government’s strong support of this jobs-generating precinct and we will continue to lobby the federal government to similarly get behind the initiative and help realise the jobs and economic benefits it will deliver for North Queensland.”
On Tuesday, the federal government announced an additional $150 million in grants funding for regional hydrogen projects, expanding its hub priority list from five to seven to include a location in every Australian state. In Queensland, the federal government’s priority location will be Gladstone, south of Townsville.

Queensland-based community group Solar Citizens said it would be unfortunate for Townsville, which is located in the far north – a region espoused by many to be an ideal location for green hydrogen production due to its proximity to Asian markets – to miss out on Commonwealth project funding.
“When you’ve got Edify, Sun Metals and Origin Energy all planning to invest in renewable hydrogen projects, it would be a real shame if Townsville missed out on this federal funding,”  Solar Citizen’s Energy Strategist, Stephanie Gray, said.
“Townsville has all the key ingredients to be a clean energy industrial powerhouse: some of Australia’s best solar resources, a skilled local workforce and world-class port facilities.”
Solar Citizens published a report earlier this year which found turning Townsville into a renewable industry powerhouse would create a $154 billion economic boost for the region. 
“Townsville has incredible potential but all levels of government need to back the region and build the enabling infrastructure to see these opportunities realised,” Gray added.
Even without Commonwealth government backing, Edify CEO John Cole described the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct’s location as ideal for developing Australia’s green energy industries.
“Existing rail and road infrastructure connecting Lansdown to the Port of Townsville makes the precinct an excellent location to lead the renaissance of exporting value-added Australian-made products to global markets.  We have long held the view that Townsville is a very good place to create a green hydrogen export industry and meet the growing need domestically and across the world for this emission-free fuel,” Cole said in a statement.
“The linking of clean electricity generation with the proposed advanced eco-industrial activity at Lansdown, together with the hundreds of millions of dollars in investment and opportunities for future proofed careers is what delights us.”
Mayor Hill described Edify’s plan as “a major vote of confidence in our city”.
“Edify’s desire to establish itself at the precinct supports Council’s ongoing efforts to work with both the state and federal government through the Townsville City Deal to get the precinct investment turn-key ready as soon as possible,” she added.

If the solar industry wants to claim it has green cred, then solar panels must be managed in a sustainable manner at the end of their usable lives.
Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Laboratory (NREL) published research that describes how to motivate the market first to reuse solar panels, and then recycle them by guiding national industrial policy to create a financially viable end-of-life solar panel industry.
The research was published in Nature Energy and offers a real number for policymakers to consider: a $10-18 per panel subsidy to pay for recycling at the end of the panel’s life.
The researchers’ projections showed that 40% of all solar panels could be reused and recycled using subsidies equal to $18 per panel for 12 years. At that price, a profitable and sustainable solar panel recycling industry could establish itself by 2032.
The NREL research said that specific tools could be effective at minimizing the landfilling of solar panels. The first simply would ban solar panels from landfills. The second option would subsidize solar panel recycling in order to lower the effective cost of recycling solar panels as the industry scales.
A qualitative description of each graph’s overarching influence is below, starting from the top left and moving to the right:
The NREL research said that recycling targets could be reached earlier and at a lower overall cost when panel subsidies are increased. Based on $28/module recycling costs and an $18 per module subsidy, (which lowers the cost to $10/module as shown in the graph below), it would take 12 years to reach a 20% solar panel recycling rate and profitable recycling. That’s six years earlier than the $10 per module subsidy, which lowers recycling costs to $18 per module and takes 18 years to achieve the same 20% rate.
In this model, subsidizing at a higher rate per module – early in the program when there are fewer modules to recycle – results in subsidizing for fewer years, thus lowering the program’s overall costs.
Due to the growing nature of the solar industry, we could tax all newly sold solar panels at a low rate to raise the $18 per solar panel being recycled. The reason the tax rate per new panel can remain low is that new panel production greatly outnumbers the quantity of panels being recycled. In the United States by the end of 2020, more than 70% of all panels had been installed in the previous five years. That means few of those panels will need end-of-life considerations for a long time.
In a mature solar industry, however, solar panels become just as likely to be replaced as newly installed. And since the average panel life is around 25 years, we might assume that eventually, 1/25th of all solar panels will be recycled each year, on the order of 4%.
Research by the International Renewable Agency forecasted that 1% of panels might fail in the first two years (mostly due to damages from shipping and installation). It also estimated that around 2% of solar panels would be landfilled after 10 years. This implies that panels in a young U.S. market are currently failing at a rate of around 1% per year. But since plenty of panels are already being reused, the number of landfilled panels is lower than 1%.
For sake of argument though, let’s assume that 1 GW of our 100 GW fleet will be thrown away in 2021.
Since the U.S. is on track to install roughly 25 GW this year, diverting the entire 1 GW of failed panels away from landfills would result in a 25:1 ratio between the newly installed panels and the failed ones. If we assume that an average panel that is being recycled produces 350 watts, then a subsidy of $18 per panel would cost $51 million.

Spreading that cost across the estimated 25 GW of newly installed solar results in a fee of about $0.002 per watt. The cost per panel works out to roughly $0.78 cents per residential solar panel, and just over $1.oo per utility-scale panel.
This would increase the cost of the average 7 kW residential project by around $15. Commercial project price increases would range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. And utility-scale projects would take on a fee ranging from somewhere in the tens of thousands of dollars up to around $1 million for a gigawatt-scale facility.

If we were to finance that fee over the solar panel’s 25-year lifetime, we would end up paying about $0.0001/kWh on a house. More efficient utility-scale facilities would cut that number down to $0.00005.

Surely this is a reasonable investment for an industry beaming with optimism and potential.
NREL suggested that we could have a profitable solar module recycling industry by 2032. That estimate is partially based on the learning rates that first described the price decrease of these same solar panels since the 1960s. Evidence supporting these recycling learning rate potentials has already emerged. One of NREL’s projections showed that if 94% of the silver and 97% of the silicon in c-Si PV modules were to be recovered, the profitability of solar panel recycling would be greatly enhanced.
And in August, researchers from South Korea published a technique that promised 100% recycling of the glass, silver, and silicon from end of life commercial solar panels. In fact, the silicon was remade into new solar cells.
How’s that for a circular economy?
