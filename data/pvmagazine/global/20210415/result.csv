It is a non-invasive technology that utilizes a light source and a photodetector at the surface of the skin to measure the volumetric variations of blood circulation and is also used for heart rate monitoring.
“Our device can be fabricated using conventional methods including the printing process,” research co-author, Tomoyuki Yokota, told pv magazine. “It means that the limiting factor of the cost is material, which is organic semiconductor itself and if organic solar cells are widely used in society, the cost of devices will be reduced.”
The system, which is just a few microns thick, was built with an organic solar module, a polymer light-emitting diode (PLED), and an organic photodetector.

The PLED is powered by an organic module with 10 series connections that showed a 28.1% efficiency with 1000 lux of fluorescent lamp illumination under indoor light. “This value is equivalent as power output of 78.2 µW/cm2 whereas power output under 5000 µW/cm2 simulated sunlight is 290 µW/cm2,” the scientists explained. “With these results, our self-powered PPG system should work under 1000 lux of indoor light with OPV modules of 4.5 cm2 device area.”
The PLED is activated when the OPV module is exposed to the light and can be shut off when the OPV module is placed in the dark.
“To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates the use of self-powered optoelectrical sensors in ultraflexible organic devices,” the academics noted. “This self-power technology used in this study will pave the wave of ultraflexible wearable optoelectronic devices which take an important role for future ubiquitous healthcare society.”
A detailed description of the device was offered in the paper Self-powered ultraflexible photonic skin for continuous bio-signal detection via air-operation-stable polymer light-emitting diodes, published in nature energy.

The 175 MW of solar added this year to the end of March in the U.K. represented a fall from the volumes installed in the July-to-September and October-to-December periods of last year but still indicated a healthy market, according to the solar and energy storage industry group.
Solar Energy UK chief executive Chris Hewett, quoted in a press release issued to accompany the figures today, said: “The U.K. solar industry is going from strength to strength. Great Britain had its cleanest ever grid electricity over the Easter weekend, with solar providing 21% of generation at one point.”
The figures compiled by the organization, with partner Solar Media Ltd, showed the quarter-on-quarter retreat in new capacity additions observed this year masks a longer-term rebound in the U.K. market since the feed-in-tariff (FIT) program was halted at the end of March 2019.
The looming deadline for closure of the scheme had prompted solar installations to roughly treble from the quarterly levels recorded a year earlier, from the end of March 2019 onwards, according to Solar Energy UK. Closure of the FIT scheme saw solar capacity additions retreat to baseline 2018 levels in the second quarter of 2019 and a relatively swift, steady uptick thereafter came to a crashing halt early last year, as Covid-19 shutdowns occurred.
The previous, apparently steady rise in the market was confirmed by a leap in new solar projects in July-to-September last year, after lockdowns were lifted, with utility scale solar leading the charge. If the first-quarter figures for this year mark a retreat to a new baseline for solar capacity additions, it would at least mark a similar level to that peak caused in early 2019 by the rush by developers to connect projects before the FIT expired.
Grid scale solar again dominated the three-month figures, amounting to 70% of the new additions in Q1, but Solar Energy UK also reported 14% year-on-year growth in rooftop capacity.
The trade body added, a freedom-of-information request it had lodged with the authorities–compelling the relevant public body to provide answers–had revealed the government had allocated almost £140 million (€161 million) for solar on public buildings this year as part of its Public Sector Decarbonization Scheme policy. That could translate into 160 MW of rooftop solar on public buildings this year, Solar Energy UK said.

That is the headline finding of the second Foot off the Gas report published by London-based environmental thinktank Carbon Tracker which, in February, spelled out how a similar ‘clean energy portfolio' (CEP) approach could save the U.K. taxpayer being saddled with £9 billion (€10.4 billion) of stranded gas plant assets this decade.
The bill for the Italian public tops out at €11 billion of stranded assets, according to Carbon Tracker's estimate of 14 GW of combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) capacity planned by Rome, even if Italy plans to use EU cash to finance the infrastructure.
Carbon Tracker said each 1,680 MW of gas plant capacity could instead be replaced, more cheaply, with a mix of clean energy technologies which includes 2 GW of solar, with that tech accounting for the biggest share of the CEP alternative. In Italy, the thinktank estimated, solar would supply 31% of the replacement solution, with demand-response technology contributing 27%, onshore wind 16%, battery storage 16%, and energy efficiency 9%. By pv magazine‘s back-of-a-beermat calculations, replacing that 14 GW of gas capacity would involve 16.67 GW of solar.
Crucially, the peak load shifting and energy storage elements of the CEP would ensure the low-carbon alternative provided the same grid services and flexibility as the gas plant, while also satisfying the nation's 50 annual electricity peak-load hours. Whilst guaranteeing the same monthly electricity output as a gas facility, the report added, in some months, the CEP would be more productive.
Carbon Tracker has estimated the point at which such clean energy portfolios reached price parity with gas plants globally–generating for €67/MWh–arrived in 2019. Based on estimates by market research firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance that gas prices will rise over the next decade while clean energy costs will fall, the thinktank has calculated the 2030 CCGT levelized cost of energy–€75/MWh–will be 60% more expensive than its proposed clean energy mix.
The environmental lobby group publicized its Italy study by referring to a Reuters report last month, which quoted Italian ecology minister Roberto Cingolani, who reportedly told U.S. climate envoy John Kerry the nation will spend €80 billion of EU funds on its energy transition over the next five years, in a bid to reduce carbon emissions 60% this decade.
Carbon Tracker said the 14 GW of gas plants in the development pipeline, including 1.8 GW due online next year and a further 4 GW by 2023, would generate the equivalent of 6% of the national greenhouse gas emissions recorded in Italy in 2019.
To make replacing the fossil fuel facilities with its proposed CEPs viable, Carbon Tracker said, the Italian authorities would have to reform an energy capacity market which is heavily skewed in favor of gas and should also leverage the successful roll-out of smart meters, for demand-response purposes, and encourage solar households to add residential battery storage.

Western Africa secured $142 million of investment in 2020, with the traditional off-grid investor magnet in the east securing $70 million, according to GOGLA's Investment Database.
In a blogpost which presented takeaways from the 2020 figures, Netherlands-based GOGLA–formerly the Global Off-grid Lighting Association–said investment remained steady despite the ravages of Covid-19 but noted rising proportions of debt and grant funding as equity investment fell an “alarming” 46% from 2019.
An inability to perform on-the-ground due diligence before investing in off-grid company stock last year, because of the restrictions caused by the pandemic, was cited by GOGLA, although it noted there were also fewer company acquisitions than seen in 2019 whilst the number of equity investments rose, from 17 to 28.
With the total off-grid investment figure rising slightly, from $312 million in 2019 to $316 million last year, it was left to debt funding and non-repayable grants to pick up the slack. In loan terms–GOGLA's head of performance and investment, Drew Corbyn, and project manager for investor engagement, Laura Fortes, wrote: “Early-stage companies seem to have a low diversity of funders to choose from and debt shows the highest investment concentration on the top deals compared to the rest of the instruments.” Crowdfunding credit appears to have stabilized at around 10% of debt funding, the blogpost added.
The public sector came to the rescue, in terms of grant funding, with non-repayable investment in health systems amid the Covid crisis a factor, said GOGLA. Grant funding registered an “all-time high” in 2020, with the blogpost warning: “We also see a lack of diversity amongst donors providing grants for seed investment and the demands on donor funding due to the pandemic may mean the environment for this type of capital becomes more challenging in the year ahead.”
Balancing that pessimistic outlook, the GOGLA duo predicted off-grid companies would be likely to benefit from Covid-recovery investment this year, albeit chiefly in the form of being loaded with debt. “Many companies have had to weather the Covid-19 storm without access to such relief funding,” added the note.
And there were positive signs when it came to the diversity of funding sources observed last year. The top 10 deals accounted for 68% of total investment in 2020, down from 90% a year earlier, and the figure for the top three deals also declined, from 56% to 41%. More companies received backing last year too, said GOGLA, with 78 beneficiaries, up from 49 in 2019. And 46 businesses banked support for the first time, up from 20 a year earlier.
The average size of investment declined, from $2.3 million to $1.62 million, which could be either a good or bad sign, given the potentially smaller demands of seed investments. Either way, though, one message was unequivocally clear from the latest set of figures: with the off-grid sector requiring an estimated $11 billion this decade to achieve the UN sustainable development goal of universal energy access, annual support for the sector will have to at least double.

The Munich-based company began decontaminating and converting the Fontenet military site in southwestern France about a decade ago. In the meantime, it has used around half of the former military base to generate renewable electricity.
The first 12 MW solar plant at the site went online in 2014 and a second one is expected to be completed by the end of this year, withe a capacity of 14.7 MW. In February, BayWa r.e. also connected a 30 MW solar park to the grid at La Martinerie, another disused military site.
“It's not just about letting a few sheep graze on the property,” said Benoît Roux, head of solar development and acquisitions at BayWa r.e. France. “We rely on long-term contracts that enable meaningful agricultural benefits through renewable energy projects.”
The sheep also take care of ground maintenance at the solar parks. BayWa r.e. designed the PV systems from the start to enable agricultural use. For example, watering points have already been created for the animals and various types of plants are being grown for sheep grazing.
“In addition, biodiversity is promoted, native species are protected and economic activities and jobs are created locally,” said Roux.

The final-phase list comprises Chinese solar developer Jinko Power; UAE-based Masdar; Saudi Arabian utility ACWA Power; Chinese module manufacturer Risen; and France's Total Eren.
The bidders who have fallen by the wayside since December are Chinese inverter maker and solar developer TBEA Xinjiang Sunoasis; Japan’s Marubeni; Indian utility NTPC; compatriot developer ReNew Power Private Ltd; South Korea’s utility Kepco, in partnership with Samsung; and Norwegian solar developer Scatec.

The research group includes Eduardo Forniés, the technology manager of Spanish PV manufacturer Aurinka Group, which is building a UMG silicon factory in Puertollano, central Spain. “The construction works are finishing but at very low speed,” he told pv magazine.
In 2019, the research group had achieved a 20.76% efficiency for a multicrystalline solar cell made of 100% UMG silicon. The result was achieved in a mass production test on a conventional production line. Two years later, the same group has provided further details on that test in the paper UMG silicon for solar PV: From defects detection to PV module degradation, published in Solar Energy, in which it came to the conclusion that this kind of silicon has not only proven to be appropriate for photovoltaic applications, but has also shown the same degradation rate as conventional polysilicon.
The cells' lifetime and degradation potential were assessed using two different kinds of wafers: a product developed with the standard UMG silicon of Ferroglobe unit, Ferrosolar; and a wafer produced with the same process but deliberately with more contaminated silicon material. “The purpose of manufacturing contaminated wafers, mainly with metals, is to give a range for solar cell performance depending on the concentration of metals and dopants in the silicon feedstock,” the paper notes. “This would be the starting point to obtain an empirical correlation between the solar cell efficiency and the contaminant concentration.”
Chemical analysis was used to study the concentration of dopants and metals. To assess the presence of contaminants and the bulk lifetime of both wafers, the group turned to injection-dependent lifetime spectroscopy (IDLS), which involves measuring lifetimes across a range of excess carrier concentrations. The materials were then sent to a production line to manufacture aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) solar cells.
The analysis showed that solar modules built with cells based on the UMG silicon exhibit the same degradation rate as modules made of conventional polysilicon. “While the loss of efficiency due to the usage of UMG had been clearly determined and quantified in the previous studies mentioned above, the degradation had not been determined so far,” the scientists explained. The modules were tested for 24 months of sun exposure at a performance ratio of 25 Celsius degrees.
The process for producing UMG silicon is claimed to be three times lower in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the conventional polysilicon. “The particularity of this process is that it takes the advantage of using a by-product, silicon tetrachloride (STC), recycling it in the beginning of the process, to transform the metallurgical grade silicon into TCS,” the Spanish group stated, adding that the lower emissions are also due to Spain's energy mix with a high share of renewables.
The research group included scientists from the Solar Energy Institute (IES) at the Technical University of Madrid and Spain's metal products provider Ferroglobe.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/15/solar-and-silver-price-hikes/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"APRIL 15, 2021",Solar and silver price hikes,"From pv magazine 04/2021
Module component prices and ocean freight rates surged in 2020 due to increased demand for Chinese goods and a pandemic container shortage. In the face of rising cost pressures, module manufacturers lowered utilization rates and postponed delivery during and after the Lunar New Year. Prices for most module components began to fall, as suppliers ramp up new capacity and module manufacturers cut capacity utilization.
Prices for silver paste, however, have remained stubbornly high. Since silver has many industrial uses, and is a precious metal used as an investment in itself, it is subject to changes in supply and demand as well as market speculation.
Silver prices surged at the end of January as investor frenzy swept the markets. iShares Silver Trust (SLV), the largest exchange-traded fund that tracks silver, recorded a price as high as $26.70 per ounce. Silver futures prices also rose to $29.90. Amid the price hikes CBOE Silver ETF Volality (VXSLV) made a jump to $82.3. Retail frenzy also caused the London Bullion Market Association’s (LBMA) silver spot price to reach nearly $30 see chart below). The LBMA silver prices are now the index for silver paste suppliers’ purchase of silver.
Silver is mainly used in manufacturing silver paste for solar cell metallization. P-type PERC technology, having hit a bottleneck in driving cell efficiencies further, now relies on the advancement of silver pastes. LBMA silver spot prices are used by silver paste suppliers and cell manufacturers as reference point during negotiations. In other words, processing costs and silver content in the paste also play a role, but silver spot price movement will directly affect the manufacturing costs of PV cells.
Silver paste prices have changed along with the LBMA silver spot price curve. Increases in silver paste price in the second half of 2020 not only pushed the costs of cells up, but also the share of silver paste in the non-silicon costs of cell production.
It is difficult to predict price movements in silver. Factors including economic trends, interest rates, and exchange rates all contribute to these price fluctuations. Under proper temperature and humidity conditions, silver pastes can be preserved for up to six months, and it usually takes suppliers at least a few months to introduce new silver pastes to help boost cell efficiencies.
With advantages in price negotiation and silver paste’s aforementioned features, cell manufacturers and vertically integrated companies do not need to stock up on silver pastes or draw inventory in advance, despite silver price movements. Instead, they can increase purchase frequency to spread the risk of silver price fluctuations to each purchase.
While silver is subject to speculation in the future, the market is big and the exchange has sufficient reserves for large short-term trading. Therefore, any speculation in the future will be short-lived. PV technology relies largely on silver pastes to improve cell efficiencies, and n-type TOPCon and HJT both require higher consumption of silver pastes. Calculating on the basis of M6 (166mm) wafers, the silver paste consumption of TOPCon cells is 50-75% higher, and HJT 200% higher, than a PERC cell. The low-temperature silver paste required to process HJT cells is also more expensive.
Once cell manufacturers and vertically integrated companies ramp up gigawatt-scale n-type cell capacity expansions, the consumption of silver paste and cost control will become issues. As the global economy rebounds from the Covid-19 recession, demand for silver will rise significantly from PV and the many other industries where the material is used.

A fast economic recovery will drive up silver prices in the long term. Global inflation collapsed last year due to the economic slump and sluggish oil prices, but it is likely to bounce back rapidly this year, thanks to a strong economic recovery and last year’s low base. By then, demand for precious metals such as gold and silver that can be used to hedge against inflation will rise, and this will push silver prices higher.
In the wake of the pandemic, PV demand looks bright as countries across the globe launch ambitious climate targets and postponed projects are getting off the ground. PV InfoLink expects module demand to reach 153.8 GW this year, up 10% compared with 2020.
In terms of PERC cells larger than 166 mm, production output is expected to hit 130 GW by the end of the year. N-type cells, led by Longi, Jinko and Tongwei’s GW-scale capacity expansion, are estimated to see 6 GW of production. As demand for silver pastes will grow steadily, silver price movement will have a bigger impact on costs for PV manufacturers.
Maintaining balance between utilization rates and cost control will become a major issue facing manufacturers amid large-scale capacity expansion and increases in raw materials costs.

In recent weeks, module prices have stabilized at a high level across most technologies, but availability to fill short-term demand remains poor. At present, almost no modules are available for below $0.20/W, even for larger projects. New deliveries of significant quantities from Asia are expected in the April-June timeframe, but even those are likely to be in the high-efficiency sector and thus the high-end price range. So far, no manufacturers have signaled that prices will come down significantly in the second half of the year.
The high cost of raw materials continues to put pressure on module prices. Many prefer not to commit to any more binding prices to avoid another train wreck like at the beginning of this year, when they could only honor agreed contract prices by foregoing any profit. Delivery volumes to Europe were quickly capped as the focus shifted to more lucrative markets. Now, some are waiting to see how demand in China shapes up before writing delivery schedules and price lists.
In Europe, it will be interesting to see whether the current high demand for modules, driven by the German market with up to 500 MW per month, will slow after the latest FIT deadline. The transition period runs until March 31, by which time rooftop systems up to 750 kW must be operational to qualify for the full FIT. Demand from April onwards will largely depend on how quickly the players adapt to new conditions and whether the small-scale sector in Germany, which is already booming, can compensate for the loss of volume in the medium-scale segment.
Over the past 12 months, PV panels have become larger and heavier thanks to larger wafer dimensions. In my view, there is one main reason driving this: to make production more efficient, and thus less expensive. Especially in times of scarce resources and high raw material prices, this seems the only way for manufacturers to make a profit without their cell and module prices rising excessively. But for planners, installers, and dealers, this creates new, sometimes intractable challenges.
A larger cell area also invariably entails a higher output amperage. Although cells are first cut in half or even smaller, operating currents of 12, 13 or even 18 amps are no longer a rarity. This poses a challenge in finding a way to connect strings that are compatible with the intended inverter. Often, new modules have such a high max current that two parallel strings can no longer be connected to a single input, which makes efficient utilization of the inverter difficult.
Neither their size nor weight of modules larger than 2m² allows single-person handling adhering to occupational health and safety measures. Products for ground mount applications, which recently have reached power ratings north of 550 W, leave mechanical handling as the only option. These products can only be safely installed with a suction lifter and robotic arm – provided there is no strong wind.
Packing density and pallet weight is another topic that has received far too little attention. Increasing the glass area invariably increases the unit weight, especially in the case of glass-glass modules. At the same time, however, the frames are thinner – in the worst case, at the expense of stability. A pallet containing 31 modules at 32 kg weighs in at more than 1,000 kg. Freight forwarders like to apply surcharges to such loads, which makes transport even more expensive. Usually module crates are stacked two high in the truck or container, and then have to be unloaded and moved to a temporary storage facility – or worse, to a construction site. This is no longer possible with a pallet truck, hydraulic lift or other light equipment; heavy equipment must be available.
For rooftop modules, further optimization is needed to ensure trouble-free installation, ideally by a single person. A module area of 2m² should be the upper limit in any case, which is true with the current cell efficiencies for module types up to 400 W. If we move from the flat roof to the pitched roof segment, especially for small systems, aspects such as aesthetics and service life come into play. Black framed, or even glass-glass modules are a good choice. Since an individual weight of 25 kg should not be exceeded, the modules should have an output of up to 350 W. For smaller roofs on detached or terraced housing, panels in the classic 48- or 54-cell format – for example, measuring 1.5 x 1 meters at 300 W – are an option. This is because, as modules get larger, limited clamping area makes it increasingly difficult to design a sound substructure.
The ideal ground-mount module may be somewhat larger. For ease of processing, however, 2.5 m² and 30 kg should be the upper limit – a format of 2.3 x 1.1 meters and 550 W, for instance – at least for a mostly manual installation. On the shipping side, packing densities of 24 to 26 modules per pallet have a long and proven track record. Modules can also be transported upright – on a euro pallet or an industrial pallet, for instance. This enables efficient loading, but the individual weight should be kept below 900 kg. An option to remove individual modules without the package collapsing rounds off my wish list.
I reach these recommendations on the basis of the above mentioned criteria, all of which seem important to me. In the hopes of stimulating a long overdue discussion on these issues, I welcome other opinions.

A consortium led by Spanish renewable-energy companies Abengoa and Acciona connected a concentrated solar power (CSP) unit to Chile's grid network on Sunday. The project is owned by U.S.-based EIG Global Energy Partners.
The system uses 10,600 mirrors (heliostats), each with a surface area of 140 m2, to reflect sunlight by concentrating the heat on a receiver at the top of a 250 m tower. Molten salt circulates through the receiver for 56 days, at a temperature of 560 C in the case of hot salt tanks, and 290 C in the case of cold salt tanks. It is stored in large ponds so it can be used to generate electricity via steam turbines.
The molten salt can conserve energy that is captured throughout the day for up to 17.5 extra hours, thanks to thermal storage in tanks. The project developers said that in the months ahead, the CSP plant will gradually deliver energy in stages to the grid.
“The first phase begins with synchronization,” the consortium said. “Then we will go to the second phase, which is the calibration of the operation, where we will be making a detailed adjustment of the different systems and we will carry out the final tests of the plant.”
The project, which obtained partial financing from a program under the European Union and the German Development Bank, is being built at a cost of €1.41 billion ($1.7 billion). It will be the first solar plant in Latin America to combine CSP and PV technologies.

Genex Power said on Thursday that it has secured AUD 660 million ($508.7 million) in external financing for the 250 MW/2 GWh pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES) facility to be built alongside the existing 50 MW Kidston solar farm in Queensland, Australia.
Sydney-based developer Genex had already secured a AUD 610 million debt facility from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) and a AUD 47 million project grant funding agreement from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and EPC contractors McConnell Dowell Constructors and John Holland Group.
The final piece of the financing puzzle was a AUD 3 million variation deed to the loan note subscription agreement it secured from Clean Energy Finance Corp. (CEFC). The financing package, in conjunction with Genex’s fully underwritten AUD 115 million of fundraising in late March, means that the project is now fully funded. The company said construction is set to start this month.
“Following execution of the construction documentation for the Kidston pumped storage hydro project, I am delighted that we have now executed all outstanding finance documents and, in doing so, secured all of the funding required to construct the project,” said Genex CEO James Harding.
The PHES facility, which will be built at the site of the abandoned Kidston gold mine, is part of the Kidston Clean Energy Hub, which includes the already operational 50 MW solar farm. Genex has declared there is also potential for further multi-stage wind and solar projects.
The 250 MW PHES facility was initially scheduled to reach financial close in 2019, but has struck some roadblocks but is now on track to become the first pumped hydro plant to be built in Australia in almost 40 years, and the first to be used specifically to support the integration of variable renewable energy generation from solar and wind.
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the project would provide reliable, dispatchable, and affordable renewable energy to the grid.
“This is a landmark project for all involved and paves the way for renewables to play a larger role in Australia’s electricity grid,” Miller said. “Genex will be delivering the first pumped hydro project in Australia since 1984 and the first to be used solely for energy storage and generation rather than water management.”
The project is part of more than 400 MW of renewable energy and storage projects Genex has in development.
The 50 MW Jemalong Solar Project in New South Wales was energized in early December and commissioning is now underway. Genex is also developing a 50 MW/75 MWh standalone battery energy storage system at Bouldercombe, Queensland.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/15/solarstorage-pushing-aside-us-coal-natural-gas-says-ieefa/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JEAN HAGGERTY,"APRIL 15, 2021","Solar+storage pushing aside US coal, natural gas, says IEEFA","From pv magazine USA
The coming surge in battery storage deployment is further eroding the economics of coal and natural gas generation and accelerating fossil-fuel plant retirements, the Institute for Energy Economic and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) says in its new 2021 US Power Sector Outlook.
Tech improvements and resulting price declines already have made solar and wind generation resources the lowest-cost option in much of the United States. During the next two to three years the accelerating shift will be transformative, the IEEFA said.
Solar+storage is currently economically competitive, and costs are almost certain to decline.
“Hitting both the [U.S. government’s] solar and the long duration storage cost goals would be a game changer,” the IEEFA said.
To pull down storage costs, the Department of Energy (DoE) launched a storage challenge in December that set a goal of reaching a levelized cost of storage for long-duration stationary applications of $0.05/kWh by 2030. Using the DoE’s own estimates, the IEEFA said this would represent a 90% cost reduction.
In February, the DoE added to that goal, setting its sights on pushing PV costs down to $0.03/kWh by 2025 and $0.02/kWh by 2030.
“Last year was definitely a breakout year for battery storage … but it’s just a harbinger of things to come,” said Dennis Wamstead, the IEEFA analyst who co-authored the 2021 outlook.
According to the IEEFA, coal’s days are numbered.
“Even being among the best operating coal-fired generators doesn’t guarantee that a unit is financially viable or is the lowest-cost option for consumers,” it said.
On the natural gas side, the IEEFA said it expects project financing to become increasingly difficult to secure due to climate change concerns, a more progressive administration in the White House, and lingering overcapacity. The possibly that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will re-examine its current hands-off approach to approving new interstate gas pipelines also presents a threat to future gas generation proposals, it said.
Party’s over?
In short, the rise in gas generation that occurred in the 2010s is pretty much over.
“Part of that is being driven by the rush to wind and solar, and part of that is being driven by the fact that there is an increasing emphasis on the environmental impacts of gas,” Wamstead said.
He said “it’s entirely possible”  that by the end of 2022 wind and solar by themselves will have caught up with coal. He said that by the end of this year, wind, solar, and hydro generation may well exceed coal’s contribution to the U.S. electricity market.
If the Biden administration pursues a 2035 carbon-neutral electricity grid with any success, “obviously that will change a lot of these forecasts,” he said.
For example, creating an investment tax credit (ITC) for energy storage or a technology-neutral tax credit that would apply equally across all forms of generation, and storage that lowers greenhouse gas emissions could also accelerate change. So, too, could the passage of several other bills in Congress, including one measure to incentivize domestic manufacturing of advanced energy technologies and another to create a transmission tax credit.
