The station is expected to start operations in mid-October, following its approval by the Chinese National Energy Administration in 2016. The technology was developed by the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP), under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The first phase of the project has a capacity of 100 MW/400 MWh, for an investment of about CNY 1.9 billion ($266 million). The second phase of the project is expected to push the full capacity to 200 MW/800 MWh. That will bring the total investment to CNY 3.8 billion, according to the Chinese Energy Storge Alliance.
The Dalian Flow Battery Energy Storage Peak-shaving Power Station will perform peak shaving and valley-filling grid auxiliary services, to offset the variability of the city’s solar and wind energy supply. Solar and wind will be used to charge the station's batteries during the grid load valley period by converting electrical energy into battery-stored chemical energy. Later, at peak grid load, the stored chemical energy will be converted back into electrical energy and transmitted to users.

The two companies signed a memorandum of understanding to seal the partnership.
According to a company statement, the first facility will be located in an undisclosed location in continental Europe, with construction of the 20 MW project expected to begin during the second half of 2024. The agreement also includes an option to develop additional CO2 battery energy storage facilities in the future.
The first facility will have a 10-hour storage capacity which will provide baseload renewable energy to Ørsted’s end-use customers, mitigating the growing variability in energy supply, and providing grid stability services.
“As a company focused on quickly scaling the build-out of wind, solar, power-to-X and other renewable energy solutions, we are delighted to work with Energy Dome to explore how we can deploy their innovative long-duration energy storage technology,” said Kieran White, VP Europe onshore at Ørsted. “We consider the CO2 Battery solution to be a really promising alternative for long-duration energy storage. This technology could potentially help us decarbonize electrical grids by making renewable energy dispatchable.”
Energy Dome started operations on its first CO2 battery facility in June, in Sardinia, Italy. The company’s battery technology is based on compressed CO2 and requires less space than systems based on compressed air.
“The concept is the same as compressed air energy storage (CAES) and liquid air technologies,” Energy Dome CEO Claudio Spadacini told pv magazine in an interview last year.
The system draws CO2 from an inflatable atmospheric gas holder, which the company calls the “Dome,” and stores it under 70 bar pressure at ambient temperature in a high-density liquid state. When the stored energy is needed, the CO2 is evaporated and conveyed through a turbine that produces power. After this process is implemented, the CO2 goes back to the atmospheric gas holder to be used again for another storage cycle, without any emissions to the atmosphere.

This represents an improvement from the 8.4% result it achieved in December 2021. It claims to have now achieved the highest efficiency ever reported for any cell of this kind to date.
“The new cell is expected to provide a boost for the development of electrical vehicles that do not require plug-in charging, and to advance other mobility applications, such as high-altitude platform stations, telecom platforms in the stratosphere,” the Japanese electronics manufacturer said in a statement.
It achieved the record efficiency rating by enlarging the cell and suppressing carrier recombination at the edge of the cuprous oxide (Cu2O) generation layer, which usually causes generation efficiency degradation.
“We found that a larger cell size effectively suppresses photocarrier recombination,” said Kazushige Yamamoto, a fellow at Toshiba's Corporate R&D center. “Increasing the power generation area from the previous 3 mm2 x 3 mm2 to 10 mm2 x 3 mm2 produced a relative reduction in recombination in the edge of the cell. The resulting increase in photocurrent pushed the power conversation efficiency to 9.5%.”
Toshiba said that placing the Cu2O solar cell over a silicon (Si) cell with 25% efficiency could result in a Cu2O-Si tandem cell with a 28.5% efficiency. Such a tandem cell, charged only once, could power an EV for 37 km, according to tests performed by the company.
Having already enlarged the previous cell’s size to 30 mm2, Toshiba is now working toward commercialization by further increasing this measure. Its goal is to achieve a 10% power conversion efficiency for a transparent cuprous oxide solar cell, and 30% efficiency for the Cu2O-Si tandem cell. To that end, it has developed a 40 mm2 prototype Cu2O cell which showed an efficiency of around 8%.
“The efficiency falloff in the larger cell is due to a less uniform layer,” the company said. “Toshiba continues to refine thin film deposition technology for uniform deposition over a larger area.”

Now, engineers at Rice University in the United States have developed a method that promises to produce stable, efficient bilayer perovskite solar cells.
The scientists found the appropriate solvent design for the application of a 2D perovskite cell top layer without destroying the bottom 3D layer.
“This is really good for flexible, bifacial cells where light comes in from both sides and also for back-contacted cells,” said researcher Aditya Mohite. “The 2D perovskites absorb blue and visible photons, and the 3D side absorbs near-infrared. It is fundamentally challenging to make a solution-processed bilayer when both layers are the same material. The problem is they both dissolve in the same solvents. When you put a 2D layer on top of a 3D layer, the solvent destroys the underlying layer. But our new method resolves this.”
The 3D/2D solar cells are about 1 micron thick, not counting the glass substrate, with a conversion efficiency of 24.5%. The cells were exposed to the lab equivalent of 100% sunlight for more than 2,000 hours and reportedly did not degrade by even 1%. The researchers expect their discovery to be compatible with roll-to-roll manufacturing.
The scientists said their method can facilitate the development of perovskite layers with “tremendous control.” They described their findings in “Deterministic fabrication of 3D/2D perovskite bilayer stacks for durable and efficient solar cells,” which was recently published in Science.
“It allows us to control the flow of charge and energy for not only solar cells but also optoelectronic devices and LEDs,” said Mohite. According to the scientists, the key to finding the solvent that allows to coat a perovskite cell with a 2D layer without destroying the bottom 3D layer lays is the balance between two properties of the solvent itself. “If you find the correlation between them, you’ll find there are about four solvents that allow you to dissolve perovskites and spin-coat them without destroying the 3D layer.”
The scientists said they expect the new cells to be useful for green hydrogen production, off-grid solar applications, drones, and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).

The LCOH is currently in the range of $1.82 to $9.62 at the global level, and between $4.42 and $8.57 in the United States, according to data from BloombergNEF (BNEF).
Verdagy also commissioned a three-cell, 500 kW commercial electrolyzer module in August at its Moss Landing pilot plant in Monterey County, California. Each cell reportedly incorporates the largest AEMs in the world, at 28,500 cm2. 
The company is now launching commercial operations. It expects production costs below $2.00/kg, with capex below $200/kW. The technology bodes well with PV, according to Verdagy. 
“Very low capex means you can couple with solar (low capacity factor) and be highly competitive,” CEO Marty Neese told pv magazine. “The lower the capex, the more optimal it is to couple with renewables at lower capacity factors.”
Andras Perl, a scientist at EnTranCe Centre of Expertise Energy at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences, said the figures are “impressive.” He explains that more information about the lifetime and degradation rate of the stacks would be of interest, but not essential, given the low LCOH. 
“The 1,000 hours testing is nice, but when they do a bit more, we could also learn more about the potential issues that we can expect,” Perl told pv magazine. 
Verdagy’s integrated process includes safety controls, sensors, and process integration in a fully automated pilot plant. The three 28,500 cm2 cells in the newly launched commercial module produce hydrogen at a rate of over 3.0 kg per hour per cell.  It said the module reached industry-leading current density operations higher than traditional and state-of-the-art Alkaline Water Electrolyzers (AWE), exceeding expectations for performance.  
The US Department of Energy recently released a draft national clean hydrogen strategy and roadmap. It focuses on high-impact uses for hydrogen, the reduction of clean hydrogen costs, and support for regional networks.
Verdagy said the measures would provide considerable economic support for technology companies, investors, and financiers. Blue hydrogen’s LCOH in the United States is currently between $1.31 and $2.72, according to BNEF data. 
“The US incentive schemes are enabling the overall de-risking of disruptive technologies like Verdagy's. Further, if we achieve our cost roadmap objectives the incentives become an enhancement to our overall financial returns,” Neese told pv magazine.

Spain's Polar Developments unveiled its new PolarGreen Container portable solar arrays at the recent AUTOPIA event in El Bosque del Santander, Spain.
Earlier this year, Polar Developments said that it was finishing the first prototype of the PolarGreen Container. It said the charging container would be equipped with a PV array ranging from 35 kWh to 84 kWh in size.
The new PolarGreen Container comes in two versions. The smaller version, which was presented at AUTOPIA, houses four rows of 34 solar panels. Once extended, the panels can supply up to 50 kWp.
However, the company has told pv magazine that the more powerful version of the container can already be ordered on request.
“The product is scalable, that is, several containers can be connected together,” the company said.
Polar Developments displayed other products at AUTOPIA, including a range of portable PV systems. All of the company's products in the PolarGreen range include storage batteries.

The Australian state of Queensland has revealed plans to build two massive pumped hydro facilities, including one that could provide 5 GW of storage.
“These are projects of national significance on a scale not seen since the construction of Snowy Hydro – bigger than Snowy Hydro,” said Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk.
The 2 GW Borumba Pumped Hydro project near Brisbane has been in the cards for some time and is scheduled for completion by 2030. The scale of the bigger Pioneer-Burdekin pumped hydro project was only revealed this week.
“It will be the largest pumped hydro energy storage in the world, with 5 GW of 24-hour storage and the potential for stage 1 to be completed by 2032,” said Palaszczuk, noting that the preferred site for the project is near Mackay.
As part of the plan, the Queensland government is now aiming for 70% of the state's energy supply to come from renewable energy by 2032, and 80% by 2035. These targets will be legislated, said the premier. For reference, currently less than one-quarter of Queensland’s electricity comes from renewables.
The Queensland government also plans to convert its publicly owned coal power stations to clean energy hubs from 2027.
“Infrastructure at the clean energy hubs will include: continuing to use the large spinning turbines at the power stations to provide strength for the energy system to take more renewables; grid scale batteries; gas and then later hydrogen power stations; and maintenance hubs for nearby government-owned renewable wind and solar farms,” said Palaszczuk.
The plan includes a vision for a “Queensland SuperGrid” to connect solar, wind, battery and hydrogen generators across the state. This will unlock 22 GW of new renewable capacity, said the government.
“It is about turbo-charging new investment in new minerals, batteries and manufacturing,” said Palaszczuk.
Kane Thornton, CEO of the Clean Energy Council, praised the Queensland energy plan.
“This is a bold and transformational plan that will set Queensland up to be a world leader on clean energy,” said Thornton.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/29/building-an-effective-meteorological-station-for-solar-pv/,"SPONSORED,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2022",Building an effective meteorological station for solar PV,"While variations in weather conditions may be of only passing concern to the average domestic PV user, they are of critical importance for commercial and industrial PV systems.
For large installations, even small relative fluctuations in performance can make a huge difference to overall productivity, and any source of output variation must be closely monitored to ensure the overall system is performing optimally.
In these cases, meteorological monitoring is essential to determine whether variations in output are due to weather conditions, or indicative of more serious hardware degradation or malfunction.
Weather monitoring is, therefore, an essential part of understanding PV system health and scheduling maintenance on time. Analysis of historical data – on precipitation and wind conditions, for example – enables seasonal trends to be uncovered, which can in turn be used to optimize cleaning and maintenance schedules on a seasonal basis.
Solar irradiance
Measurements of solar irradiance are crucial to determine the efficiency of a solar plant. This is usually expressed in terms of a performance radio (PR): the actual yield of the plant (how much energy it produces in a given time period) expressed as a percentage of its theoretical yield (how much energy it could produce in that time period assuming the panels convert the incident light into energy at their nominal efficiency).
Performance Ratio = Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield x 100
The theoretical yield of a plant can only be calculated using measurements of different components of solar irradiation. This means that these measurements are essential to calculate the performance ratio.
Performance ratio is a vital indicator for PV asset owners – but it’s far from the only parameter of interest. Monitoring other weather parameters that directly impact solar cells is essential to obtain a complete picture of plant performance.
Ambient air and module temperatures
Photovoltaic efficiency is strongly dependent on temperature. As a rule of thumb, for every degree centigrade the temperature rises over 25 C, the efficiency of a typical PV module drops by around 0.5%. Measuring both the temperature of ambient air and the modules themselves enables the calculation of a temperature-corrected performance ratio, giving PV plant operators a more accurate picture of plant performance.
Wind speed and direction
Wind can also have a dramatic effect on PV module temperature. Since PV surface temperatures are hotter than ambient air, wind cools them down, thus increasing their efficiency and output in warmer environments. Wind also has a significant effect on soiling, so knowledge of wind conditions can play an important role in soiling monitoring.
Since high wind speeds can damage PV installations, monitoring wind speed and direction is often important for determining safe locations for equipment – and can affect insurance payments.
Precipitation
Different kinds of precipitation can have a range of effects, both good and bad, on PV plants. For example, while heavy rainfall can dramatically reduce soiling by washing off dirt, light rainfall can actually increase panel soiling. Meanwhile, hailstorms can cause serious damage to panels and equipment.
Humidity, air pressure and dew point
Air pressure, humidity and dew point affect the occurrence of snow, frost, and condensation on panels which, as well as decreasing energy output, can have an effect on soiling. Air humidity, in particular, can also produce spectral changes which affect the productivity of PV modules.
Thanks to the number of parameters of interest and the sheer volume of different sensors on the market, assembling a meteorological station capable of providing complete and accurate information can be daunting.
Often, mixing-and-matching sensors from different vendors means contending with multiple data formats and software interfaces as well as having to grapple with complex mounting configurations and long cable runs. OTT HydroMet offers a complete range of meteorological sensing solutions that provide a simplified and integrated experience.
OTT HydroMet meteorological sensors are tailor-made for commercial and industrial solar PV installations. The Lufft WS line offers powerful instruments with various combinations of sensors for measuring atmospheric parameters. For solar PV applications, the Lufft WS600, which measures air temperature, wind speed and direction, relative humidity, air pressure, and precipitation, is the most suitable.
Lufft WS all-in-one sensors come with active ventilation and integrated heating to deliver best-in-class accuracy and long-term reliability, providing commercial and industrial PV facilities with unparalleled insight into plant performance.
Thanks to its simple modular design the WS600 can be easily integrated into existing data acquisition systems via a single Modbus connection. Integration with other OTT HydroMet solutions is made especially easy using the Smart Hub, which enables pyranometers, soiling monitoring systems, and weather sensors to be connected.
A complete environmental monitoring system from OTT HydroMet means all relevant weather parameters can be easily, accurately, and reliably monitored with proven instruments from its brands such as Kipp & Zonen and Lufft.
Selected setup recommended for solar PV plants:
Furthermore, the new Kipp & Zonen SMP12 Class A pyranometer comes with integrated heating and additional features to maintain highest measurement accuracy such as sensors to measure the tilt angle and humidity inside the housing.

The Indian solar manufacturer and developer says it will expand its cumulative module capacity to 1 GW in five to six months, from 500 MW at present. It aims to have 2 GW of cumulative, operational cell and module capacity by the end of 2024. 
The company also has ambitious plans for green hydrogen, green ammonia, and electrolyzer production. It is now in talks with leading alkaline electrolyzer technology suppliers to start electrolyzer production under a joint venture. 
“Jakson has a very concerted focus on green hydrogen and green ammonia production, and fuel cells for mobility as well as energy needs,” Bikesh Ogra, chief executive officer of Jakson, told pv magazine at the Renewable Energy India Expo 2022 this week. “We have plans for utility-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production down the road. And we are in discussions in multiple Indian states and geographies outside India, wherein we would like to get into utility-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production.”
Green hydrogen is challenging in terms of transportability and storage at the utility scale, which is why Jakson is also looking at distributed-generation green hydrogen and on-site ammonia. It believes this will be far more economical and practical. In this space, the company is exploring biomass gasification-based green hydrogen generation projects with an individual capacity of 2.5 tons to 5 tons per day.
