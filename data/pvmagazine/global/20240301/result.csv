Looking ahead, production volume in 2024 is forecast to be between 280,000 MT and 300,000 MT, approximately 40% to 50% more than 2023. As for financials, it noted annual revenue in 2023 of $2.3 billion compared to $4.6 billion on 2022 due to “much lower” average selling prices. Net income was $421.2 million in 2023, compared to $1.81 billion in 2022. Its latest quarterly results were also announced. It indicated sales volume fell to 59,906 MT in Q4 2023 from 63,263 MT in Q3 2023, with revenue also falling to $477.1 million in Q4 2023 from $484.8 million in Q3 2023. The margin improved to 18.3% in Q4 2023 (up from 14.0% in Q3 2023), as did profit, which grew to $44.9 million in Q4 2023 compared to a net loss of $6.3 million in Q3 2023.
The State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) has committed CNY10 billion to set up a manufacturing facility in Lankao, Henan province, featuring 5 GW of PV module capacity and 5 GW of energy storage capacity. Spanning over 300,000 square meters, the facility will also include a research center. Initiated in November 2022, the project has made significant progress, with construction now exceeding 60% completion.
China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the National Energy Administration (NEA) jointly released the “guideline for the development of the state grid,” outlining ambitious targets for China's power grid by 2025. The directive mandates the integration of 500 GW of distributed renewable energy. The initiative also aims to transition the national grid from a singular power supply and distribution service entity to a comprehensive source network facilitating efficient allocation of power generation, storage, and load.
Xinyi Solar announced an increase in gross profit in 2023 compared to 2022. Its revenue was HK$26.62 billion, up 29.6% compared to sales in 2022. Profit increased by 9.6% to HK$4.18 billion in 2023, up from HK$3.82 billion in 2022. Its solar energy project business achieved grid connected capacity of 1.09 GW, with 974 MW of utility-scale ground-mounted projects and 120 MW of distributed generation projects. The company indicated that thin glass “continued to increase” in share of sales 2023. In the second half of 2023, the transition from P-type to N-type material drove thin glass sales sales, along with demand for modules for utility-scale ground-mounted PV power projects. The company sees thin glass becoming a mainstream product. It said it planned to increase its total daily melting capacity of solar glass from 25,800 tonnes at the end of 2023 to 32,200 tonnes as at the end of 2024. In addition, the Group has started preparations for the establishment of new production bases domestically and abroad, notably in Indonesia. No commissioning date was mentioned except that it would be 2025 or later.

FIA is betting on liquid storage due to its lower volume and weight compared to compressed gas tanks (CGH2).
PT PLN has inaugurated the Kamojang green hydrogen production facility in West Java, Indonesia. It is the first geothermal-based green hydrogen production plant in Southeast Asia. Geothermal-based green hydrogen is produced from condensation water from the Kamojang PLTP electricity production process.“We built the plant at Kamojang with a production capacity of 4.3 tons per year,” said PT PLN President Darmawan Prasodjo. The company also recently inaugurated Indonesia’s first hydrogen vehicle filling station in Jakarta. “The new station shows PLN's continued efforts and innovation in developing an end-to-end hydrogen ecosystem in Indonesia, after in November 2023 inaugurating 21 green hydrogen plants (GHP),” the company said in a separate press release. The company can produce 203 tons of green hydrogen per year and said it wants to use 128 tons “to support the development of the hydrogen vehicle ecosystem.”
OMV Petrom has signed two financing contracts to build two green-hydrogen production facilities with a total capacity of 55 MW at the Petrobrazi refinery in Romania. The Austrian company said it signed the contracts with the Romanian Ministry of Energy for a maximum funding amount of €50 million ($54.2 million), with the total investment coming it at EUR 140 million. It noted that public support comes from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), a funding facility supported by the European Commission.
Powerhouse has signed an initial five-year framework agreement with Australia-based National H2 for multiple hydrogen-based projects in Australia, Italy, Switzerland, and Hong Kong. “The agreement sets out the terms on which the company's technology and engineering expertise would be provided, on a project-by-project exclusivity basis, to National H2,” said Powerhouse. Engsolve, a wholly owned subsidiary of Powerhouse, will undertake the front-end engineering design (FEED) for the facilities, which will be fully funded by National H2.
Siemens Energy has agreed to supply HH2E with high-voltage systems and power transformers, which are essential components for its large-scale green hydrogen production units across Germany. The two companies said HH2E's strategy focuses on maximizing the use of curtailed power, in order to convert untapped green electrons into green hydrogen production.

2,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/01/alberta-lifts-moratorium-on-renewable-energy-projects/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CANADA",PATRICK JOWETT,2024-03-01,Alberta lifts moratorium on renewable energy projects,"The government of the western Canadian province of Alberta has ended an almost seven-month long moratorium on approving renewable energy projects. The pause started in August 2023, when the Alberta Utilities Commission began an inquiry into land use and reclamation.
Upon lifting the ban on Feb. 29, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said the government would now take an “agriculture first” approach to future renewables projects. It plans to ban renewable power projects on agricultural land deemed to have excellent or good irrigation potential, in addition to setting up 35 km buffer zones around areas the government classifies as having pristine views.
The Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanREA) has welcomed the end of the ban, and said it did not affect operational projects or projects already under construction. However, it said it expects the impact to be seen in the coming years. It said the ban on approvals has “created a climate of uncertainty with negative consequences for investor confidence in Alberta.”
“While the pause has lifted, there remains significant uncertainty and risk for investors wishing to participate in Canada’s hottest market for renewables.,” said CanREA President and CEO Vittoria Bellissimo. “It is critical to get these policy changes right, and to do so quickly.”
The association said the government’s decision to make some parts of the province off-limits for renewables is “disappointing.” It said it means local communities and landowners will miss out on the benefit of renewables, such as associated tax revenues and lease payments.
“Wind energy and solar energy have a long record of co-location with productive agricultural land use,” said the association. “CanREA will work with the government and the AUC to seek opportunities to continue these beneficial approaches.”
Alberta is at the forefront of Canadian renewables development. Figures from CanREA show that the province accounted for more than 92% of Canada’s overall growth in renewable energy and energy-storage capacity in 2023. It added 2.2 GW of installed renewables capacity last year, including 329 MW utility-scale solar and 24 MW of on-site solar.
CanREA said another 3.9 GW of projects with the potential to come online in 2025 are in the pipeline, alongside another 4.4 GW of proposed projects with later commissioning dates. But it warned that these are all now “at risk.”
Figures from the International Energy Agency show that at the end of 2022, Canada’s cumulative solar capacity hit 4.4 GW. Alberta had the second-most installations, at 1.3 GW, only exceeded by Ontario at 2.7 GW. The country has set a target of 35 GW of total solar capacity by 2050.

The company's mtu EnergyPack QG large-scale battery storage systems, which are based on the nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery chemistry, will be used at two locations from autumn 2025 onwards. A 20 MW/40 MWh system will be installed at the AST substation in Tume in west Latvia and a 60 MW/120 MWh battery storage at the AST substation in Rezekne in the east. 
The facilities will provide the fast and automatically activated frequency regulation reserves needed for synchronization with the European grid.
According to Rolls-Royce, the battery system will provide power reserves at significantly lower costs than the existing conventional power plants.
“We are proud to be able to make a significant contribution to this important and safety-critical project in Latvia,” said Jörg Stratmann, CEO of Rolls-Royce Power Systems.”The facility for Latvia will be our largest battery storage system to date.”
As part of the agreement, Rolls-Royce has signed a five-year long-term service agreement for the system. The order also includes general contractor services as well as installation and commissioning.
Rolls-Royce supplied the Netherlands’ biggest battery storage system to date in November 2022.

The hybrid offshore plant will be located in the Gulf of Taranto, off the coast of Corigliano-Rossano, in Calabria. It will feature 28 floating wind turbines with a cumulative capacity of 420 MWp and 120 MWp of floating PV.
The development is part of Green Arrow Infrastructure of the Future Fund (GAIF) and is currently under permitting with an estimated commercial operation date in 2028.
The project will feature SolarDuck’s elevated platform technology, which allows PV panels to be deployed in significant wave heights, while maintaining a safe working environment for access and maintenance and minimizing environmental impacts.
“With the current momentum, we believe this is a unique opportunity for the offshore renewable energy industry to help shape a favorable regulatory framework and facilitate the scaling of OFPV,” said SolarDuck CEO Koen Burgers. “This is not just important for Italy, but also for other countries in the Mediterranean.”
SolarDuck unveiled its first demonstrator project in 2021. It deployed the 64 kW system at an inshore site on the Waal (Rhine) River, near IJzendoorn, the Netherlands.
Its floating arrays hold the solar panels more than 3 meters above the surface of the water, and are able to handle coastal sea conditions and hurricane-force winds. The systems are optimized for offshore sites in estuaries and natural harbors, as well as near-shore sites.
The basic floating platforms are triangular structures measuring 16 meters x 16 meters x 16 meters. They resemble offshore floating wind platforms or floating oil platforms and can be flexibly connected together to form large plants.

5,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/01/italian-startup-offers-roll-to-roll-process-for-organic-solar-panels/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",VALERIE THOMPSON,2024-03-01,Italian startup offers roll-to-roll process for organic solar panels,"Italian startup Ribes Tech has developed a roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing process for organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules.
The process includes a slot die coater and screen printing stations. “We have a pilot line that has proven itself. Every layer of the PV cell is deposited through standard R2R printing techniques,” Francesca Scuratti, manager of product development at Ribes Tech told pv magazine. “It requires no transparent conductive oxides for bottom electrode, uses no rare or scarce materials, and the modules themselves are easy to integrate into power sub-systems.”
The company is a spinoff of a collaboration between Italian printing specialist OMET Group and the Italian Institute of Technology. It has a manufacturing capacity of 200,000 devices a year, based on a system with two printing heads and a 30 cm web width.
The process enables the production of very thin indoor energy harvesting devices designed to be battery replacements or retrofits in a wide range of low-power electronic devices, such as remote sensors, smart labels, and tracker devices.
Ribes Tech's modules have 12% power conversion efficiency indoors when integrated as a component of an electronic device, and work efficiently in the whole indoor range, from 5 lux up to 2000 lux, according to Scuratti.
“Now we are looking for investments to support our next scale up phase. We are ready to produce PV modules in high volume, like printing labels,” said Scuratti, noting that at full scale with multiple printing heads, the company’s equipment could print “up to several tens of millions of photovoltaic cells.” For example, up to 50 million units of small-sized OPV devices measuring 3 cm x 5 cm.
The Italian company, founded in 2016, sees potential for its energy harvesting modules to address several challenges in wearable and Internet of Things (IoT) electronics. For example, enabling lower maintenance costs related to manually changing or charging batteries, complying with regulations that would restrict the use of non-rechargeable batteries, and reducing environmental hazards related to materials used in conventional batteries.
At the recent Consumer Electronics Show, a U.S. trade fair, one of Ribes’ partners presented two innovative battery-free solutions for ultra-low power sensors. One of them, is a dome-shaped environmental sensor based on a registered design by compatriot company Innoitaly. Suitable for homes, offices, and gardening applications, it integrates Ribes' PV modules along with humidity, temperature, light, occupancy sensors and a data communications sub-system.
“They are completely maintenance-free, a so-called ‘set & forget' solution that maximizes the light harvested from every direction,” said Scuratti.

6,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/01/pv-expo-tokyo-2024-lightweight-modules-agri-pv-and-big-storage-aims/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,JAPAN",MARIAN WILLUHN,2024-03-01,"PV Expo Tokyo 2024: Lightweight solar modules, agri-PV and big storage aims","Making the best of limited spaces was the overarching theme at this year's Smart Energy Week, held this week at Tokyo Big Sight. The event attracted around 70,000 visitors and exhibitors across six individual exhibition spaces in five halls. The organizers noticed a 30% increase in exhibitors over last year's show.
However, the growth in exhibitors and visitors does not reflect the growth of the market. Japan's solar installation figures have stood steady at around 6 GW to 7 GW per year and will remain at that level in 2024, said Izumi Kaizuka, director and principal analyst at RTS Corp. She believes the jump in exhibitors occurred because module manufacturers are sitting on a stockpile of modules that need to be sold. With China's installation figures projected to take a slight dip in 2024, competition to sell modules is increasing, leading manufacturers to sell their products in every market they can – and Japan is no exception.
That said, the Japanese market does have unique characteristics. For example, a lack of available land means that the market has traditionally mainly been driven by the rooftop sector. Japanese residential rooftops are small and fragmented, meaning that smaller modules must be pieced together to use available space, making them more popular than larger modules with higher efficiency rates.
Japanese manufacturers such as Sharp and Panasonic, as well as long-established suppliers from overseas, meet this demand with their offerings for the country. Trina Solar, for example, offers modules with the exact width for standardized corrugated metal roofs in Japan.
For larger commercial and industrial (C&I) rooftops, weight plays a critical role. Roofs made from corrugated metal were not designed to bear the weight of PV arrays. Therefore, many new module manufacturers entering the Japanese market this year are offering lightweight plastic modules to overcome this challenge. They range in weight from 6 kg to 11 kg for 450 W to 550 W modules, with installers adhering them directly onto metal rooftops. Such panels are rare in other parts of the world, but at the Tokyo event, more than half of the module manufacturers displayed them at their booths.
Another (possibly Japan-specific) module trend is the lack of a lower edge on modules for better water drainage. Longi, DAH Solar, and many other manufacturers displayed modules sprinkled with water, showing that panels with lower edges accumulate pools of moisture at the bottom. Preventing this helps to minimize soiling, according to the manufacturers.
In addition to rooftop installations, two other types of projects are currently dominant: agrivoltaics and PV for parking lots. Many mounting structure manufacturers exhibited solar carports for residential and commercial use. Germany-based S-Rack has set up a branch in Japan to sell these kinds of mounting structures and has reported a massive jump in demand for such solutions. S-Rack's technical sales representative, Jan Habenicht, said the company sold 80 systems in Japan last year, up from just three in 2022.
New PPA rules are also driving the Japanese carpark PV market, which is making it relatively easy to invest in projects. Habenicht said that banks, investors, and businesses with high power demand are actively seeking green investment options, including corporate PPAs, alongside legal parking lot owners. Local power companies are also seeking businesses with big parking lots for usable PV space. This market is something to watch in Japan.
Japan has already installed several megawatts of fully commercial agrivoltaic operations. The Ministry for Agricultural Affairs has launched a program allowing farmers to sell their agrivoltaic power to nearby communities at no grid cost, said Kaizuka. Farmers see this as a reliable income source alongside agricultural produce. The main setup involves high-mounted modules accommodating tractors underneath, although vertically mounted PV modules are increasingly favored, as shown by the numerous mounting structures at the trade show. Vertical installation has proven particularly effective in snowy regions during the winter.
Another big topic in the Japanese market is storage. Grid congestion issues have slammed the northern and southernmost regions of Hokkaido and Kyushu, with curtailment rates of 30% and higher for many project owners. There is no compensation for curtailed power in Japan, causing project developers to show growing interest in the co-location of battery storage and ground-mounted PV.
An auction system held in January tendered 2 GWh of standalone storage, mainly in Hokkaido and Kyushu. Auction participants were required to provide at least 10 MW systems with a minimum three-hour duration. Project owners will primarily use these for arbitrage purposes, to alleviate grid congestion in these areas.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) plans to hold more auctions this year and in the future. Overseas project developers for storage systems who attended the show expressed high hopes for this market segment.
Kaizuka of RTS Corp. said she expects Japan’s PV market to reach 15 GW of installations per year in 2030 and about 23 GW in 2035. A combination of upward revisions of renewable energy targets, regulatory reform, lower component prices, and mandatory environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments will continue to drive the Japanese market. In the years to come, Japan could hit 279 GW of cumulative installations – well above the 117 GW target in its latest strategic energy plan.

The factory, which was inaugurated at the start of this year, covers an area of 107,000 square meters, with 67,000 square meters taken up by a cell production workshop. It focuses on the production of 182 mm, 199 mm and 210 mm TOPCon cells.
The fully automated facility currently employs 560 people and 420 front-line workers in the workshop. The site features a 5G-automated guided vehicle (AGV) based transport system of mobile robots and is paired with a fifth-generation mobile network. Cell production is powered by a rooftop PV system and was designed with a concentrated water recycling system.
Sunova Sun is currently ramping up production to its final volume of 9 GW per year, which is equivalent to approximately 36,000 high-efficiency modules per day. It said cell quality is ensured through a range of different tests, such as color and appearance sorting, EL testing, and IV electrical performance tests, as well as additional reliability tests, including tension and light decay testing.
“Investing in our own cell manufacturing line is a key milestone in our long-term strategy and will decrease our dependency on other suppliers, thereby securing consistent quality cell input for our high efficiency modules,” said Sunova Solar Chairman Mike Song. “It enables us to serve our customers with advanced technology that we continuously develop.”
Sunova Solar currently operates three manufacturing factories in China and Vietnam. The company said that as of December 2023, it had shipped more than 4 GW of cumulative modules throughout the world.
Last year, Sunova Solar released a series of its n-type TOPCon solar modules, featuring bifacial dual-glass solar panels with power outputs ranging from 585 W to 605 W.  Shortly after it was listed as a tier-1 module manufacturer by BloombergNEF, after completing eight projects of more than 1.5 MW with non-recourse financing from at least six different banks.

8,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/01/solar-producers-across-northern-asia-miss-out-on-el-nino-generation-bump/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,ASIA",,2024-03-01,Solar producers across Northern Asia miss out on El Nino generation bump,"While El Nino typically delivers warmer than average temperatures to Northern Asia, analysis from the Solcast API of conditions from December to February this year shows some winners and losers. In the north, a cloudy Lunar New Year impacted February irradiance and brought down the season average. Solar producers in several provinces of Central China, will have benefited from clearer than normal conditions in December and particularly February, bringing up the average to 20% more than expected. In the tropics strong thunderstorm activity occasionally broke through typically drier El Nino conditions, delivering regional variation, despite generally higher irradiance than normal in Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines and Southern Indonesia.

China saw large variances across the continent, with almost every region seeing less than average irradiance, other than Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei and Chongqing provinces which saw up to 20% more irradiance than normal. Several northern regions were seeing clear conditions, through December and January, until a winter weather outbreak around Lunar New Year in February dropped irradiance significantly, up to 20% below normal for February, and consequently up to 10% below normal for winter. Whilst on average, China saw slightly warmer temperatures than normal, this was accompanied by large variations. On Feb 18, -52.3 C was recorded in Xinjiang province while Badu in the south of China reached 38°C. The same weather that drove these variations interrupted the typical El Nino patterns.

Korea and Southern Japan saw consistently cloudier conditions than in normal years, decreasing irradiance and solar potential across the region. Despite being slightly warmer than average, several cold fronts brought outbreaks of cold arctic air, and associated cloudy and snowy weather events. Irradiance across South Korea was 15% below average for the whole winter period, and 30% below average in February. Solar potential in southern Japan was 5-10% below average for the season, also driven by a cloudy February, though Northern Japan was above average for most of the season.

South East Asia saw above average irradiance, consistent with typical El Nino patterns, but January was a cloudy month. The remainder of the tropics saw mostly average conditions for the season, though month-to-month conditions were dominated by typical tropical variability. Irradiance over Thailand was about 5% above average in most areas, driven by clear conditions in December and February which saw up to 10% more irradiance than normal. Typical El Nino conditions in the tropics see drier than usual conditions, more like what was seen in Vietnam this year.
The current El Nino event is coming to an end, and its drying influence over tropical parts of Asia was masked by periods of more active tropical thunderstorm activity.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

The outdoor experiments were conducted over a year in eight locations in Saudi Arabia and were compared to lab tests that replicated potentially relevant soiling mechanisms. “I am very optimistic that the results can be generalized to other arid and semi-arid areas with high soiling losses from mineral dust,” corresponding author Dr. Klemens Ilse told pv magazine. 
“The laboratory tests consist of three main procedural steps: dry dust deposition, processes to modify dust adhesion, and a cleaning process, including characterization steps in between,” explained the researchers. “This study is the first to comprehensively analyze a large number of coatings and samples, correlate and compare the soiling patterns of the indoor and outdoor experiment results, and identify the key mechanisms for predicting the outdoor performance of ASC.”
The field tests took place from February 2019 to January 2020 in Al-Khafji, Solar Village, Al-Qassim, Riyadh, Makkah,Tabuk, Yanbu, and Al-Ahsa. In all locations, the glass samples were mounted at 25 degrees. Glass panels were changed and analyzed quarterly, except in Al-Khafji and Solar Village, where they were tested monthly. Different coatings were tested both in the lab and outdoors – some with hydrophilic properties, while some identified as hydrophobic.
In the lab test, all experiments were conducted at a sample tilt angle of 20 degrees, with Arizona A2 dust and wind speed of about 15 m/s when the wind was simulated. The scientists could control the humidity from 20% to 80% and the temperature from -5 C to 80 C. Four different tests were conducted to reflect different soiling mechanisms.
In dry deposition tests, which primarily reflect the process of particle rebound, dust was simply deposited on the samples. The dry deposition and wind blow tests, which represent the effect of particle resuspension, were done by deploying dust on the samples and then blowing on them with an air knife. Dew tests were done with either light or heavy dew, to simulate caking effects. In these test, dust was deposed, then wither light or heavy dew was simulated, followed by wind.
“In the annual average correlation analysis taking the annual average soiling losses into account, dry tests after wind blow and light dew tests after wind blow showed a strong correlation for most locations,” the scientists stated. “That is while dry tests after deposition and heavy dew tests after wind blow indicated a low correlation or anti-correlation respectively.”

Explaining the results, the scientists said that in desert conditions, the increased particle resuspension by wind is one of the dominant factors for high anti-soiling performance. “The heavy dew tests in the laboratory may be more feasible for predicting soiling for locations with higher frequency of dew and especially strong dew events that can clean the surface, which are typically rare in the Middle East,” added Dr. Ilse.
The scientists also analyzed the Al-Khafji and Solar Village cases for seasonal footprint. The tests were conducted monthly and presented a general trend in which heavy dew tests appear to be more predictive of outdoor soiling behavior during the dry summer months, while the dry and light dew tests may be more predictive of soiling behavior in the humid winter months.
“These results may seem counter-intuitive at first, but they could be explained by the interaction of dew with hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface properties. This includes the processes of caking, increased particle captures during wet surface conditions, and reduced capillary adhesion during dry seasons,” the scientists said. “However, further investigations are necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the observed effects, including outdoor and laboratory testing with various coating types.”
The results were presented in “Correlation between laboratory and outdoor soiling experiments with anti-soiling coatings,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. The research was conducted by academics from Germany’s Anhalt University of Applied Sciences, Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics (CSP), Fraunhofer Institute for Microstructure of Materials and Systems (IMWS) and Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Research (ISC), as well as Saudi Arabia’s King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST).

Ice storage involves the production of ice in isolated containers for later use, for example, during times of decreased solar irradiation. In the research, the academics considered both series-matching (SM) ice storage and parallel-matching (PM) ice storage.
In SM ice storage, the storage tank is connected in series to an air cooler. “In this form, the system simultaneously enables the supply of cooling through the air cooler and storing cold energy in the ice storage tank when solar energy is available. In addition, the ice storage tank supplies cooling during the night or when irradiance is insufficient,” they explained.
In PM ice storage, the air cooler and ice storage tank are connected in parallel. “In this form, the system stores cold energy in the ice storage tank before supplying cooling when solar energy is available, thereby allowing the ice storage tank to continuously supply cooling,” they added.
The research was conducted on a refrigerated warehouse with a volume of 24.472 m3 that could operate either by PV or grid power. It consisted of 5.4 kW of solar panels and an inverter, which operated the vapor compression refrigeration (VPR) system. “The VCR sub-system mainly consisted of an AC compressor with a frequency converter, a condenser, a throttle valve, an air cooler and an ice storage tank, all connected in sequence and utilizing R22 as the refrigerant,” the scientists further explained.
The research group also noted that the system was built to allow it to switch between SM and PM modes. To operate in the first mode, a valve between the throttle valve and the air cooler was opened while a valve between the throttle and the ice storage tank, as well as a valve between the pump and the ice storage tank, was closed. For the second mode, the opposite connection was used.
The system operated under different conditions: the system was either powered by the grid or by the PV; the system ran under no-load and full load;  and the operation technique was either SM or PM.
Under the PV-SM operation, the refrigeration coefficient of performance (COP) was 2.47 under no load and 2.66 under full load. Under the same terms, the whole system COP was 0.26 and 0.28, respectively. The PV-PM system, however, displayed poorer results, with refrigeration COP of 2.26 under no load and 2.56 under full load. System Cop for PV-PM was 0.25 and 0.27, respectively.
“The cost of the SM mode is lower than that of the PM mode. Compared with the PM mode, the total cost of annual equal payment of SM under PV drive decreased from $6,494.69 to $5,906.16, which is 9.96 % lower than the PM mode,” they also stated. “Compared to utility electric-driven system, PV is more energy-efficient, and the economic cost of the SM mode is lower than that of the PM mode.”
Since the PV-SM proved superior, the academics proceeded to store 1,500 kg of green grapes for fresh-keeping in it for two weeks. Following this period, its net weight with fresh-keeping reduced from 1475.10 to 1460.25 kg. Moisture was decreased from 86.51 % to 85.135 %, and sugar content from 16.18 % to 15.78 %. For reference, without fresh keeping, moisture dropped from 86.154 % to 79.593 %, and sugar content declined from 16.28 % to 12.28 %.
“Results indicate that maintaining the storage temperature of the system at 5 C prevented a decrease in grape quality, resulting in a 5.186 % decrease in water content and a 3.61 % decrease in sugar content,” they concluded. “The reduction in mass inferred that if the grapes were kept at room temperature their overall mass loss would have been considerably high. The fresh-keeping method prevented the mass reduction of the green grape owing to minimized water evaporation.”
The system was presented in “Research on the characteristics of photovoltaic-driven refrigerated warehouse system under different ice storage modes,” which was published in Results in Engineering. The group comprised scientists from the Yunnan Normal University and the Yunnan Key Laboratory of Refrigeration.

The Indian cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has approved PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana with a total outlay of about $9 billion to install rooftop solar and provide free electricity every month for 10 million households. The prime minister launched the scheme on Feb. 13.
The program includes CFA for residential rooftop solar. The scheme provides a CFA of 60% of the system costs for 2 kW projects and 40% of the additional system costs for arrays between 2 kW and 3 kW of capacity. The CFA will be capped at 3 kW. At current benchmark prices, this will mean a INR 30,000 subsidy for 1 kW systems, INR 60,000 for 2 kW systems, and INR 78,000 for systems above 3 kW.
Households can apply for subsidies through the national portal and will be able to select suitable vendors to install rooftop solar. The national portal will assist households in their decision-making processes by providing relevant information such as appropriate system sizes, benefits calculators, and vendor ratings.
Households will be able to access collateral-free, low-interest loan products of around 7% at present for the installation of residential rooftop solar systems up to 3 kW.
Other features of the scheme include:
Through this scheme, households will be able to save on their electricity bills while earning additional income through the sale of surplus power to distribution companies.
The proposed scheme will result in addition of 30 GW of solar capacity through rooftop solar in the residential sector over the 25-year lifetime of rooftop systems.

“FlectoSol is the first compliant, adaptive façade shading module functionalized on both sides with photovoltaics and, by integrating two actuators in different laminate layers, enabling the movement in two directions required for solar tracking,” the research's lead author, Larissa Born, told pv magazine. “The PV functionalization of FlectoSol aims for an energy self-sufficient shading system. By solar tracking, the energy gain at the façade can be maximized and, at best, energy can be provided for other aspects of building operation.”
In the paper “Flectosol – A pneumatically activable PV-functionalized façade shading element with bending motion in two directions for solar tracking,” published in Developments in the Built Environment, Born and her colleagues said the PV façade uses two pneumatic actuators integrated in an elastomer hybrid composite based glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP). 
The two actuators allow bending in two directions of approximately 90 degrees and are manually slid into the hinge cavities formed by a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) layer in the hybrid composite. “The hybrid composite laminate as well as the pneumatic actuators are manufactured in a hot pressing process,” the scientists said. “In the case of the GFRP-elastomer laminate, a self-adhesive ethylene-propylene-diene(monomer) rubber (EPDM) sealing tape is applied around the laminate setup on the lower steel plate to limit resin leakage.”
With this technology, the research group built a full south-oriented façade demonstrator covered with octagonal thin-film solar modules that can bend by up to 80 degrees.
The modules are all part of one tracking and pneumatic network, with the upper module alone housing the solar tracking system. “The rest of the modules will actuate accordingly,” the academics explained, noting that each Flectosol system consists of four modules coated on both sides with a PV foil.
They ensured that there was “good” adhesion between the foil and the thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) surface coating of the fiber-reinforced plastic, and that the PV thin films proved to be functional.
“For proving the possible use in real applications as a façade component, cyclic testing is pending to analyze the fatigue strength and prove the scalability of the hypotheses made here,” they concluded. “Furthermore, the robustness under additional loads as they would occur in outdoor applications such as wind and snow, have to be analyzed.”

With perovskite efficiency at converting sunlight to electricity edging up on that of silicon, the main challenges now are optimizing that efficiency and controlling degradation. A team of researchers at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have revealed a new way to engineer perovskites on the nanoscale.
The work is described in a paper published in Nature Energy by Dane deQuilettes, a recent MIT postdoc who is now co-founder and chief science officer of the MIT spinoff Optigon, along with MIT Professor Vladimir Bulovic and Professor Moungi Bawendi, as well as 10 other scientists at MIT and in Washington state, the United Kingdom, and South Korea.
The researchers describe their unique combination of nanoscale characterization techniques that enabled them to find a tunable passivation strategy in perovskite solar devices.
“Ten years ago, if you had asked us what would be the ultimate solution to the rapid development of solar technologies, the answer would have been something that works as well as silicon but whose manufacturing is much simpler,” Bulovic said. “And before we knew it, the field of perovskite photovoltaics appeared. They were as efficient as silicon, and they were as easy to paint on as it is to paint on a piece of paper. The result was tremendous excitement in the field.”
Nonetheless, “there are some significant technical challenges of handling and managing this material in ways we’ve never done before,” he said. These challenges have driven researchers to study perovskites, and this work shows how to passivate the material’s surface so that the perovskite no longer degrades so rapidly or loses efficiency.
In previous work, research teams developed methods for passivation, but there wasn’t a clear understanding of how the process works. The new MIT study provides a clearer roadmap. The team observed the interfaces between the perovskite layer and other materials, and how they develop, which resulted in “the clearest roadmap as of yet of what we can do to fine-tune the energy alignment at the interfaces of perovskites and neighboring materials,” and thus improve their overall performance, Bulovic said.
“The key is identifying the chemistry of the interfaces, the place where the perovskite meets other materials,” Bulovic said, in reference to the places where different materials are stacked next to perovskites in order to facilitate the flow of current through a device.
The new study “addressed the ability to passivate those interfaces and elucidate the physics and science behind why this passivation works as well as it does,” said Bulovic.
“This paper is essentially revealing a guidebook for how to tune surfaces, where a lot of these defects are, to make sure that energy is not lost at surfaces,” said deQuilettes. “It’s a really big discovery for the field. This is the first paper that demonstrates how to systematically control and engineer surface fields in perovskites.”
The new work builds on a common passivation method developed at MIT, which led to new world-record efficiencies. The recent efficiency records for a single perovskite layer range from about 24% to 26%, while the maximum theoretical efficiency that could be reached is about 30%, according to deQuilettes.
An increase of a few percent may not sound like much, but in the solar industry incremental advances are important.
“In the silicon photovoltaic industry, if you’re gaining half of a percent in efficiency, that’s worth hundreds of millions of dollars on the global market,” said deQuilettes.

The scientists numerically simulated and optimized the solar cell via the SCAPS–1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium.
The solar cell was designed with a transparent substrate made of glass and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), a hole transport layer (HTL) based on cadmium sulfide (CdS), the CuSbS2 absorber, an electron transport layer (ETL) made with carbon (C), and a gold (Au) metal contact.
FTO and CuSbS2 have an energy bandgap of 3.5 eV and 1.5 eV, respectively, while for CdS and C these values are 2.42 eV and 3 V, respectively.
“Cadmium sulphide was used as an electron transport layer hence preventing holes from reaching the front contact,” the researchers said. “FTO was preferred to ITO because it has special characteristics in chemical inertness, upon heating it is stable, hard mechanically, a good conductor, relatively cheap and its sheet resistance remains constant during sintering.”
To optimize the device, the academics investigated different thicknesses of FTO, CdS, C, CuSbS2, as well as the defect and dopant concentration in the absorber. They found that FTO should have a thickness of 100 nm. Furthermore, they found that CdS, CuSbS2, and C should have a thickness of 50 nm, 300 nm, and 100 nm, respectively.
The optimized cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 16.17%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.9389 V, a short-circuit current density of 28.32 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 60.8%.
“The variation of dopant concentration revealed that an increase in dopant concentration led to an increment in efficiency of the photovoltaic cell,” they explained. “Defect density increase led to a decrease in diffusion length indicating augmented recombination rate.”
The new cell concept was introduced in the paper “Numerical study of copper antimony sulphide (CuSbS2) solar cell by SCAPS-1D,” published in Heliyon.

Germany-based 1Komma5° has continued its planned AUD 100 million ($65 million) spending spree to secure a major market share in Australia’s renewable energy transition with the acquisition of Gold Coast-based Arkana Energy Group.
Philipp Schröder, CEO of 1Komma5°, said the transaction is the company’s fourth investment in Australia.
“This expansion in Australia is our biggest investment to date,” he said, noting that the acquisition more than doubles 1Komma5°’s presence in the Australian market. “Arkana fits perfectly with our ambitious growth targets and our mission to create a worldwide one-stop-shop for renewable energy solutions. With our fourth investment in Australia, we are well on our way to fighting for market leadership in 2024.”
Arkana Energy, established a decade ago and now operating in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, is one of the nation’s largest solar retailers for residential and business installations, with more than AUD 40 million of revenue last year.
Data from SunWiz shows Arkana Energy is among the top five companies in Australia for capacity of residential solar power systems installed in 2023, with approximately 20 MW deployed.
Arkana Managing Partner Luke Stronach said the company, with a team of 120 people, has completed more than 15,000 installations on both domestic and commercial premises across the country so far.
“Now is the perfect time to grow,” he said, alluding to the rapid growth in solar installations in Australia, with the overall installed capacity growing from 11.5 GW in 2019 to 34.2 GW in 2023.
Hamburg-based 1Komma5° made its first foray into the Australian market when it acquired home solar and battery installation company Natural Solar in late 2022. This was quickly followed by the acquisition of Solaray Energy and the recent purchase of Adelaide-based Kozco Energy Group.
As well as selling and installing solar panels and batteries, the company has also developed the Heartbeat energy management system. The system connects to and controls solar panels, batteries, smart meters, heat pumps and other electrical devices around the house, and co-ordinates the buying and selling of electricity to and from the grid.
The company claims that a solar-battery system optimized by Heartbeat can save as much as 120% off electricity bills.
Arkana Chief Executive Tyson Stronach said the central control system will pave the way for 1komma5° to shift from a PV and battery focused company to a true one-stop-shop for smart energy solutions.

Prices have held steady for the seventh consecutive week as market participants adopt a wait-and-see approach for a clearer price trend to emerge.

Market sentiment was mixed. There were some talks in the market of possible domestic Chinese price increases of CNY0.03-0.05 ($0.042-0.069)/W in March but other market participants were uncertain if the price hikes would materialize given ample inventory in the market.
Other market participants attributed the possible price hikes to suppliers’ reluctance to accept orders at previously lower prices and the fast conversion of p-type to n-type in the market had resulted in a drop in P-type supply. “Cell makers had increased P-type prices before the Lunar New Year but did not increase n-type prices”, a market source said.
One seller held on to the view that any price increases in the Chinese market would be for p-type modules as production had reduced and that N-type modules could see some price declines. However, other market participants said this remains to be seen.
The outlook for March was improving with demand expected to recover in Q2-Q3 as overseas projects usually start construction after winter, while in China, module tenders are generally carried out in the first half of the year and construction in the second half of the year, a solar veteran said. The Chinese market will see 30-40% of demand in the first half of the year, with most of the demand concentrated in the second half of the year, the veteran added.
Module makers are expected to increase their operating rates as demand improves in the coming weeks. China is expected to produce more than 50 GW of modules in March, according to the Silicon Industry of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities.
