The study will deploy floating solar platforms, integrated with other renewable sources, at an undisclosed offshore testing site in Singapore waters, subject to regulatory approval. If the study is successful, the parties plan to design and deploy a pilot system with at least 100 MW of renewable generating capacity.
“With limited land space in Singapore, moving into waters offshore presents opportunities to unlock the potential for more diversified renewable energy sources, thereby enhancing energy security and supporting Singapore’s transition to a greener energy mix,” said Cindy Lim, CEO of Keppel Infrastructure.
Keppel will study how to develop and operate the park, while the two universities will look at how to overcome the challenges presented by high winds and the impact of waves on the mooring and anchoring system. They will also study the effects of salinity on corrosion and biofouling issues.
National University of Singapore (NUS), which houses SERIS, will provide expertise in design and components selection, as well as the implementation and operation of the floating solar platforms. NTU will create tidal models of tidal flow conditions to assess the power density of the turbines and paddles.
“As one of the leading research institutes on floating solar worldwide, SERIS is very excited to provide its expertise to this novel approach of integrating floating solar with other renewable energy solutions,” said Thomas Reindl, deputy CEO of SERIS. “If successful, the proposed hybrid technology would also have great export potential.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/28/latest-advances-in-sodium-ion-battery-research/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,GERMANY",MARIJA MAISCH,"OCTOBER 28, 2022",Latest advances in sodium-ion battery research,"Anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its low cost, non-toxicity and abundance. However, the low electronic conductivity and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics at high rates are holding back practical applications.
A team of researchers from the College of Materials Science and Engineering at Qingdao University in China has demonstrated a sol-gel approach to the synthesis of thermally stable anatase nanoparticles with a carbon shell as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.
When the synthesized anatase was tested in a half battery, the researchers found that the battery exhibited a reversible specific capacity of 228 mAh g-1 – at a current density of 0.05 A g g-1 with 100% capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at 1 A g-1.
In-situ X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy results have revealed a nearly zero-strain characteristic of anatase during charge/discharge processes. In-situ transmission electron microscopy, ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy results suggested an irreversible sodiation-activation process to form a sodiated-TiO2 phase during the initial discharge process.
A full coin cell assembled with anatase as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode delivered an energy density of 220 Wh kg.The scientists reported their results in “Sodium-ion Storage Properties of Thermally Stable Anatase,” which was recently published in Energy Material Advances.
Operando analysis
A joint research group from Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, meanwhile, has used operando techniques to observe how solvated natrium ions embed themselves in electrodes.
The storage of ions, when accompanied by their solvation shell in a crystal lattice, is referred to as “co-intercalation.” Up to this point, this concept was limited to the negative electrode of the sodium-ion battery. Now, Berlin-based researchers have succeeded in extending the concept to the positive electrode of the battery.
“With titanium disulphide (TiS2) and graphite, we have for the first time combined two materials that absorb and release the same solvent during charging and discharging of the battery,” said Guillermo A. Ferrero, one of the researchers behind “Co-intercalation batteries (CoIBs): Role of TiS2 as electrode for storing solvated Na ions,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.
The scientists could observe changes in the material during charging and discharging via operando measurements performed in the X-Ray Core Lab at HZB on the LIMAX 160. This helped them to assign the co-intercalation mechanism inside the battery.
“The process of co-intercalation could improve upon efficiency by enabling better low temperature performance,” said Katherine A. Mazzio of HZB. “It could also be utilized to improve upon alternative cell concepts such as using multi-valent ions instead of Li+ or Na+ storage that are particularly sensitive to the solvation shell.”

Around 40 GW of wind and PV will generate about 120 TWh of electricity per year on the steppes of southwestern Kazakhstan. That power will support a 20 GW industrial park of electrolyzers on the Caspian Sea coast, to produce up to 2 million tons of green hydrogen per year. Production is scheduled to start in the Mangystau region in 2030. In 2026, the company will make a final investment decision for the project, which has been valued between $40 billion and $50 billion.
Chinese researchers have achieved an efficiency of 14.4% for a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) system, decoupling water electrolysis for separate hydrogen and oxygen evolution. The decoupling requires a lower voltage to drive each half-reaction. “By introducing sodium nickelhexacyanoferrate (NaNiHCF) as the redox mediator, decoupled acid water electrolyzer and amphoteric water electrolyzer were respectively constructed,” said the researchers. “The required voltages for the hydrogen or oxygen evolution steps matched the output voltages of the perovskite solar cell (PSC).” The team used single Crystal Formamidinium Lead Iodide (FAPbI 3) and combined a FAPbI 3-based PSC with an efficiency of 18.77% with the decoupled amphoteric water electrolyzer. “A solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 14.4% was achieved, which outperformed previously reported PSCs driven water electrolysis cells,” the team wrote in “Decoupled water electrolysis driven by 1 cm2 single perovskite solar cell yielding a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 14.4%,” which was recently published on ChemsSusChem. 
Stellantis has announced plans to mass produce hydrogen-powered fuel cell versions of Peugeot, Citroën, and Opel light commercial vehicles. It will assemble the hydrogen-powered vehicles in France.
Westport Fuel Systems and Scania have announced engine test results for Westport’s High-Pressure Direct Injection (HPDI) fuel system for heavy-duty vehicle applications. “The early test results show performance with a peak Brake Thermal Efficiency of 51.5 % complemented by 48.7% at road load conditions, all with engine-out NOx similar to the base diesel engine, which is compatible with Euro VII and EPA27,” said Westport Fuel Systems. The HPDI technology is an alternative to fuel cells, using hydrogen in an internal combustion engine.
NanoSun and Hydrogen Systems have signed a memorandum of understanding to deliver sustainable hydrogen refueling solutions to central Europe.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/28/annual-added-pv-capacity-will-more-than-quadruple-to-650-gw-in-2030-says-iea/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",ROLAND ERNST,"OCTOBER 28, 2022","Annual added PV capacity will more than quadruple to 650 GW in 2030, says IEA","From pv magazine Germany
PV and wind power are the most important way to reduce emissions in the electricity sector, the IEA said in its new “World Energy Outlook 2022” report. Their share of electricity generation will increase from 10% in 2021 to 40% in 2030, reaching 70% in 2050, according to the agency.
Solar provided more than 3% of global electricity generation in 2021.  Annual capacity addition reached 150 GW, making 2021 another record year. Solar panel prices have fallen by 80% over the past decade, thanks to economies of scale and continuous innovation throughout the supply chain. As a result, PV has become the most affordable power generation technology in many parts of the world. The IEA expects annual growth to more than quadruple to 650 GW in 2030.
By then, annual solar and wind power installations in the United States will increase two and a half times from today's levels, thanks in part to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). New targets are also driving the massive build-up of clean energy in China, with the country's coal and oil consumption peaking before the end of this decade. Accelerated renewable energy deployment and efficiency improvements in the European Union mean that EU demand for gas and oil will fall by 20% and coal consumption by 50% over the course of this decade, according to the report.
The average selling price of solar panels rose for the first time in 2021 – by around 20% from 2020 – due to higher freight and commodity prices, particularly for polysilicon. While module prices remained at high levels in the first half of 2022, the IEA said that continuous innovations, further improvements to materials, and energy efficiency will lead to further cost reductions.
The energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine could accelerate the transition to a more sustainable energy system, according to the IEA. Although the use of fossil fuels will peak in this decade, it will then decline in the long term. The IEA forecasts that more than $2 trillion will be invested every year in climate-neutral technologies by 2030, through programs like the IRA, REPower EU, and others in Japan, South Korea, and China. This corresponds to an increase of more than 50% compared to today. However, that would still fall short of 1.5-degree target, which would require a $4 trillion investment by 2030.
“The energy markets and energy policies have been changed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and not just temporarily, but for the coming decades,” said Fatih Birol, director-general of the IEA. “Even with today's political framework, the energy world is changing dramatically before our eyes. Government responses around the world promise to make this an historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/28/epfl-sets-new-efficiency-record-for-dye-sensitized-solar-cells/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"OCTOBER 28, 2022",EPFL sets new efficiency record for dye-sensitized solar cells,"The history of mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) dates back to the 1990s, when they were demonstrated by Brian O'Regan and Michael Grätzel at Switzerland’s École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). Since then they have been commonly known as “Grätzel cells,” and this week a group of scientists led by Grätzel announced a new breakthrough.
The group fabricated dye-sensitized solar cells with greater than 15% efficiency under direct sunlight, and achieved efficiencies of up to 30% under varying ambient light conditions. The scientists described the cells in “Hydroxamic acid preadsorption raises efficiency of cosensitized solar cells,” which was recently published in Nature.
In an accompanying press release, the group explained that dye-sensitized solar cells convert light into electricity through photosensitizers. These dye compounds absorb light and inject electrons into an array of oxide nanocrystals, which are then collected as electric current. The photosensitizers are attached to the surface of nanocrystalline mesoporous titanium dioxide films, which are saturated with redox-active electrolytes or a solid charge-transport material. The entire design aims to generate electric current by moving electrons from the photosensitizer to an electrical output such as a device or storage unit.
The latest achievement comes down to advancements in the photosensitizers and other components, said the researchers. The key to improving efficiency lies in understanding and controlling the arrangement of dye molecules on the surface of titanium dioxide nanoparticle films that favor the generation of electric charge, they added. One method is cosensitization, a chemical manufacturing approach that produces the solar cells with two or more different dyes that have complementary optical absorption.
Dye combinations
The EPFL used this approach to achieve the new efficiency record, taking advantage of the combined dyes to develop a cell that can absorb a larger portion of the light spectrum. Finding the right combination of dyes that can achieve high light absorption and conversion efficiency was the key challenge for the group, requiring a lengthy process of molecular design, synthesis and screening.
The group, led by Grätzel and fellow scientist Anders Hagfeldt, succeeded in improving the combination of two newly developed photosensitizer dye molecules, by developing a technique in which a monolayer of a hydroxamic acid derivative is pre-adsorbed onto the surface of nanocrystalline mesoporous titanium dioxide. This slows the adsorption of the two sensitizers and enables the formation of a well-ordered and densely packed sensitizer layer on the titanium dioxide surface.
Using this approach, the EPFL researchers demonstrated dye-sensitized solar cells with an efficiency of 15.2% under standard “one sun” illumination – the first time this technology has passed the 15% mark. The cells also demonstrated operational stability in more than 500 hours of testing. And testing the cells over a wide range of different light intensities revealed increased performance under ambient light conditions – up to a maximum of 30.2% efficiency.
The dye-sensitized solar cells are transparent and can easily be manufactured in a variety of colors. Typical applications include skylights, greenhouses or glass facades. Because they are lightweight and flexible, they are also suitable for use in portable electronic devices.
“Our findings pave the way for facile access to high performance DSCs and offer promising prospects for applications as power supply and battery replacement for low-power electronic devices that use ambient light as their energy source,” said the EPFL researchers.

“The extension gives confidence in the market regulator,” Moritz Sticher, a senior adviser at Berlin-based consulting firm Apricum, told pv magazine. “Without such extension, we would have probably seen a number of stranded assets. That not only hinders reaching Malaysia’s [renewable energy] targets but is also detrimental in attracting investment.”
The Malaysian Energy Commission made the decision in August. Apricum said the decision was a response to concerns about the bankability of projects, due to rising material prices and fears of rising interest rates.
A number of project owners have also asked the Malaysian Energy Commission to review electricity bid prices, but the regulator rejected this, according to local media reports. Prices submitted by projects between 10 MW and 30 MW in size range from MYR 0.1850 ($0.049) /kWh to MYR 0.2481/kWh. For projects with capacities between 30 MW and 50 MW, the bids range from MYR 0.1768/kWh to MYR0.1970/kWh.
The LSS4 program awarded 823.06 MW of capacity across 30 projects. In total, it has awarded 2,457 MW, but only 1,160 MW of that was operational by the second quarter of 2022, according to the report. The next round, LSS5, is expected to start in 2023, with the government currently studying the inclusion of virtual PPAs.
Malaysia currently has 2,165 MW of total installed solar capacity, according to data from Apricum. It aims to add an additional 1,098 MW by 2025, and another 2,414 MW by 2035. The country has raised its renewable energy targets to 31% by 2025, equaling 8.53 GW of total renewable generation capacity, and to 40% by 2025, or 10.94 GW.

US-based Enphase Energy, a major supplier of solar microinverters, reported record revenues of $634 million in the third quarter, and has announced plans to expand production in the US market. 
Enphase CEO Badri Kothandaraman said that the company has signed letters of intent with new manufacturing partners and will extend its partnerships with existing ones. It plans to open four to six manufacturing lines in the United States by the second half of 2023 to meet rising demand.
“The logic is we are anyway growing fast as a company. We have to build extra lines somewhere,” said Kothandaraman. “And therefore, these lines that I invest in, they’re not going to be wasted. They’re not going to be extra. They will probably be required. You can think about it as I’m accelerating them by a few months.”
The company said that many questions remain to be answered about the implementation of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as it relates to domestic manufacturing. It is currently working with industry partners and stakeholders to provide comments to the US Department of the Treasury.
“We are going to iron out those details, hopefully in the next three months, and things will be a lot clearer,” Kothandaraman said. “But for now, we are investing in it.”
The company said its IQ8 microinverters accounted for approximately 47% of all microinverter shipments during the third quarter of 2022. It said it expects to continue expanding its international presence. For its fourth-quarter outlook, Enphase said it expects revenue to be within the range of $680 million to $720 million.

The regulation is currently under public consultation and is expected to be adopted in the first quarter of 2023. The authorities began working on it in 2017. It will purportedly provide consumers with comparability standards, resulting in products that are easier to repair and recycle, according to Stefano Soro, head of unit at the European Commission.
The eco-design draft regulation was welcomed by panelists from across the industry chain. It proposes the introduction of a carbon footprint calculation for PV modules, but not for inverters, which would instead face a reparability requirement.
“Calculation of carbon footprint should be done for everything we touch,” said Christopher Case, president of PVthin.
However, he said the policy could have “unintended consequences” if it is not properly implemented. The proposed carbon calculation standards might be biased against thin-film modules, even though they are reportedly less carbon intensive.
Soro said there are provisions for new technologies and companies.
“The [commission] is proposing to exclude from the scope of the regulation new technologies entering the market and companies with small [up to 500 MW] production volumes,” he said.
The energy labeling regulation, which could assign ratings based on the energy yield of modules, was heavily criticized across the board.
“Energy yield doesn’t provide value for consumers or the industry,” said Case, noting that the solar industry is focused on efficiency and economics. “A piece of paper on the back of a module won’t affect decisions.”
