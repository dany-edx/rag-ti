“In the first week after our 50% increase to the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, applications tripled,” Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said.
Homeowners in England and Wales could apply for a £7,500 grant to replace their traditional fuel-burning boilers with 45kWth heat pumps.
The UK government said the program aims to “encourage property owners to replace existing fossil fuel heating with more efficient, low carbon heating systems including heat pumps and biomass boilers.”
Applications for the scheme’s latest round grew more than threefold than the average weekly rate before the change in grant fees, the UK government said. Applications were 60% higher than the previous average, according to the announcement.
From May 2022 to October 2023 as part of the program, up to 7,374 gas-fuelled boilers and 3,216 oil-fuelled boilers have been switched out for heat pumps, with most (57%) of the 15,456 properties located rurally (57%) compared to urban (43%), according to UK government data.
The Boiler Upgrade Scheme started in May 2023 and will finish in December 2027.

The researchers attempted to thoroughly quantify the amount of lithium that the deep subsurface geothermal reservoir of the lake could contain.
Researchers estimate 18 million metric tons of lithium in the Salton Sea's geothermal reservoir, with at least 4 million tons already confirmed through drilling. The challenge now lies in discovering how to extract lithium from this geothermal brine on a commercial scale. Separating lithium from geothermal brine is considered a less invasive procedure than the blasting and other hard rock mining done in countries such as Australia, or the huge open-air evaporation pools in the salt flats of Latin America.
The study also notes the advantage that this type of lithium extraction is accompanied by the production of geothermal energy, which combines the production of renewable energy with the generation of materials to promote the development of electric vehicles.
“This is one of the largest lithium brine deposits in the world,” said Michael McKibben, a geochemistry professor at the University of California, Riverside, and one of the report's 22 authors. “This could make the United States completely self-sufficient in lithium and stop importing it through China.”
The Salton Sea Geothermal Resource Area currently has approximately 400 MW of geothermal generation capacity installed, and is estimated to have the potential for up to 2,950 MW. It is estimated that the currently proposed geothermal energy and lithium recovery operations would require around 3% of the historically available water in the region.
The land beneath the Salton Sea is owned by three entities: the federal government, the Imperial Irrigation District of California and the Cahuilla Indians of the Torres Martínez Desert.
In January 2023, electric vehicle battery maker Statevolt acquired 135 acres in Imperial Valley, California, near the Salton Sea, where it plans to build a 54 GWh lithium-ion battery gigafactory, capable of producing enough batteries to power 650,000 electric vehicles per year.

The British company teamed up with several companies in the hydrogen sector for different projects, from production based on SOEC technology to the ground test of the the “world's first run of a modern aero engine on hydrogen.” The company then explained to pv magazine that the company remains committed to developing its hydrogen capability in partnership with easyJet. “We ran the world’s first modern aero engine on green hydrogen last year; we plan to ground test a higher thrust engine on hydrogen next year; and we still have ambitions to take this technology to flight test in the long term. We are on track to deliver our commitment to power a mid-size aircraft on hydrogen in the mid 2030s in partnership with easyJet.”
ACWA Power has launched the first phase of a green hydrogen project in Uzbekistan. It has an annual capacity of 3,000 tons. “Once the second phase is complete, 2.4 GW of wind energy will power the production of 500,000 tonnes of green ammonia per year,” said the Saudi Arabian company. 
The European Commission has included hydrogen and electrolyzer installations in its list of cross-border energy projects for the first time, offering streamlined permitting and regulatory procedures for 65 projects among the 166 Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and Projects of Mutual Interest (PMIs). These initiatives are now eligible for EU financial support from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), and the commission has also approved a Spanish state aid scheme to support hydrogen projects.
Lhyfe plans to produce up to 330 tons of green hydrogen per day at its Lubmin plant in northern Germany, with a targeted commissioning date of 2029. “Part of Lhyfe’s backbone development strategy, this plant will feed into the German core hydrogen pipeline network, for the development of which the German government recently unveiled a €20 billion financing plan,” said the French company. The project site will offer access to existing and future electricity production capacities from offshore wind farms. It benefits from an extra-high voltage grid connection operated by 50Hertz, which already operates a transformer station in Lubmin. The plant will be built on the site of a decommissioned nuclear power plant.
Spain's Port of València has became the first port in the world to use a stacker capable of moving containers of more than 30 tons using only hydrogen as fuel. “Hydrogen is stored on board the ReachStacker in high-pressure tanks that can be refilled in 10-15 minutes,” said the port. The port also said that it deployed the first hydrogen-powered terminal tractor, developed by Atena, Enea, and the Parthenope University of Naples. “This Terminal Tractor has a fuel cell/battery hybrid powertrain, which allows the vehicle to perform all the intensive tasks that are required during roll-on/roll-off operations. Its hydrogen storage system, made of four Type 3 cylinders (350 bar), has an overall capacity of around 12 kg, which guarantees a continuous operation of at least six hours.”

An anaerobic digestion plant is a power facility that can produce methane from manure.
“Decentralized energy production systems provide opportunities for resource exploitation locally, together with energy self-sufficiency in remote communities,” the scientists explained, noting that using solar panels for both electricity and heat in the anaerobic digestion of organic wastes might be suitable for isolated areas. “The decentralization strategy will require new digester configurations be able to operate with minimum operational costs in areas with limited energy connectivity, where the organic substrates are produced.”
The PVT system conceived by the group is connected to a combiner box with batteries, and it is used to operate the digester, pumps, mixers, and the biogas upgrading unit. The latter is used for producing biomethane and is turned off during periods of low irradiation levels.
The thermal energy collected by the panels is utilized to increase the temperature of the digester until optimal conditions of 35 C are reached. The heat is then transferred by a network of tubes, allowing hot fluid from solar panels and cold fluid from within the anaerobic digester to circulate.
To analyze the novel decentralized production system, scientists have assumed it operates in a medium-sized pig farm with 2,000 heads, using their manure. According to the scientists' calculations, such an operation will have a daily electric consumption of 38.3 kWh. The upgrading unit, they said, will demand 0.125 kWh/m3 biogas.
Using a set of equations, the research group has assessed the production of the set-up under varied climatic conditions in five global locations: Soria (Spain), Iowa (United States), Odense (Denmark), Santa Catarina (Brazil), and Laixi (China). Their irradiation values and ambient air temperatures were obtained from the Solargis software.
The analysis showed that Odense had the lowest irradiance and was the only place where the system was unable to meet the necessary electricity demand. “In the rest of the locations, only a part of the production, in greater or lesser quantity, would be used to maintain the temperature of the digester, but in any case, ensuring its operability and the biomethane generation through the year,” the scientists explained.
The annual volumes of biomethane were at values between 14,107 m3 for Odense and 29,607 m3 for Santa Catarina. The annual production in Soria, Iowa, and Laixi is similar, averaging 25,000 m3. Concerning the use of biomethane in those areas, the yearly biomethane savings were up to 65%.
An economic analysis of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) concerning 20 years of operation found an average value of $0.045/kWh for all five locations. “The economic study revealed that the PV/T hybrid solar technology proposed for enhancing the conventional anaerobic digester boasts a remarkably competitive LCOE value when compared to other energy sector technologies,” the researchers said.
They introduced their assessments in the paper “Hybridization of anaerobic digestion with solar energy: A solution for isolated livestock farms,” published in Energy Conversion and Management: X.

We also consider the ramifications of the current global oversupply of solar panels, Australia’s prospects of refining battery raw materials, and examine how the European Union’s green hydrogen ambitions are developing.
Announced in March 2023, the BESIPPP program is aimed at increasing the grid capacity in the Northern Cape supply area through energy storage. In February this year, South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa declared a state of disaster to deal with the country’s acute energy crisis, which has led to chronic blackouts and load-shedding.
South Africa is powered mostly by coal and gas, with the International Energy Agency saying these traditional fossil fuels account for 85% of the country’s current energy mix. South Africa had 5,826 MW estimated installed PV capacity at the end of last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

The proposed methodology utilizes numerical weather prediction (NWP) models to forecast the PV system's output and then passes it through an optimal control strategy for battery usage.
“The problem to be addressed is to accurately forecast solar energy production to effectively manage solar power variability by integrating a battery storage system to improve the optimization and availability of solar PV energy during high demand levels in commercial sectors,” the researchers added.
For their method, the scientists used irradiance and ambient temperature with the data of a commercial PV system. With that, they calculated the cell temperature, using it to further forecast the output power. Then, a control strategy was applied for the predicted battery use.
“The control strategy first checks the building demand and calculates whether this load can be supplied only from PV,” they explained. “It allows for this if the PV supply can meet the demand. If the demand exceeds the PV supply, it is supplied by battery storage plus PV power. If there is still a deficit in the power supply, grid power will meet the demand. Any excess energy from PV is stored.”
As for the irradiance and ambient temperature, the academics used an unnamed open weather source, which combines the Weather research and forecasting (WRF) model with the Numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, and it is commonly used in solar forecasting, as it can simulate various atmospheric processes.
They tested the new methodology on a 16.8 kW with four strings, each with 14 modules with each an output of 300 W. The AC inverter was assumed to be 15 kW. They also compared the performance of this system with a reference array with the same characteristics in South Africa, for one winter month and one summer month.
Through these measurements, the scientists found that the root mean square error (RMSE) for the summer month was 425.79 W and for the winter it was 595.1 W.
“Furthermore, an excellent positive correlation exists between the predicted output power and the observed results, with R2 values over 90%,” the researchers said.
They presented the new approach in the study “Intelligent solar photovoltaic power forecasting,” published in Energy Reports. The group also comprises academics from South Africa's Tshwane University of Technology and the University of Sharjah in the UAE.

The company said the new Nepura series is a replacement of its Optimised Heating 4 series, which was launched in 2017.
“Nepura is engineered to operate down to -30 C and ensures high heating capacity at low ambient temperatures,” the manufacturer said. “The improved outdoor unit structure with full bottom plate equipped with a standard heater avoids ice build-up.”
The systems use difluoromethane (R32) as the refrigerant and have outdoor unit dimensions of 662 mm x 442 mm x 1022 mm. Their output ranges from 2.5 kW to 3.5 kW and their seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) is between 4.85 and 5.17.
The new products also feature what the manufacturer calls “weather compensation” and “fireplace logic,” which considers secondary heat sources in dwellings.
“As soon as the room reaches the set temperature, the fireplace logic function starts automatically, switching off the indoor unit heating while keeping the fan rotating to distribute warm air across the room,” the manufacturer explained.
The Nepura line can be combined with Daikin's indoor series Emura, Stylish, Perfera, and Comfora.
“Nepura’s indoor units feature a specially designed fan that optimizes airflow for high-performance at low sound levels down to 19 dBA,” the company stated.

AGL and United State-headquartered energy technology company SLB have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to pilot a nickel-hydrogen battery – expected to be the first of its kind in Australia – at AGL’s Torrens Island site in Adelaide.
SLB will supply AGL with a 180 kW/360 kWh nickel-hydrogen battery for the two-year pilot program which is expected to commence in 2025. The pilot project will test the operational performance of the technology, with the battery providing storage for on-site power use.
Travis Hughes, general manager of AGL’s Energy Hubs unit, said nickel-hydrogen battery technology is an example of the battery technologies the company is exploring as part of its broader ambition to add up to 5.9 GW of firming capacity to its portfolio by 2035.
“This is the first new battery technology AGL is piloting since it established an emerging battery technology team,” he said, noting that nickel-hydrogen technology could be a potential alternative to the lithium-ion solutions that currently dominate the stationary energy storage market.
“Nickel-hydrogen batteries have been identified as a technology which may offer different benefits when compared with lithium-ion batteries such as the potential for a longer cycle life, the potential to withstand a greater temperature operating range – meaning more potential applications and reduced need for cooling – and the potential cost benefits associated with these advantages,” he said. “Exploring and testing innovative technologies as they are developed and bringing them to market at scale is critical as we try to accelerate our efforts to transition our business over the coming decade.”
While the Torrens Island pilot is expected to be the first deployment of a nickel-hydrogen battery in Australia, the technology is not new. Nickel-hydrogen batteries consist of a stack of electrodes inside a pressurised gas tank. The cathode is nickel hydroxide and the anode is hydrogen. When the battery is charging, a catalytic reaction generates hydrogen gas. During discharge, the hydrogen oxidises and converts back to water.
The technology has been used for decades in aerospace applications but the use of expensive platinum catalysts has ruled out the use of the batteries in grid-scale scenarios.
SLB said that has now changed with California-based battery startup EnerVenue having made a breakthrough in catalyst design, swapping out the platinum catalyst for an inexpensive nickel-molybdenum-cobalt alloy catalyst.
EnerVenue said its nickel-hydrogen batteries can last for 30,000 charge cycles, are fireproof, and outperform lithium-ion batteries on a number of key metrics for energy storage at the large scale.
If the potential benefits of the nickel-hydrogen battery are verified during the pilot, the next step for AGL could be to explore the development of a grid-scale project using the same technology.
SLB Vice President of Energy Storage Oktay Sancar said the Torrens Island pilot project will help de-risk the technology by augmenting the solutions with advanced system design, integration and deployment optimisation.
“This type of collaboration will set the stage for the next generation of utility-scale applications,” he said.
The announcement follows the opening of AGL’s 250 MW/250 MWh battery energy storage system at Torrens in August 2023. That system uses lithium iron phosphate technology.
AGL aims to add about 12 GW of generation and firming by the end of 2035 – comprised of up to 6.3 GW of renewables and 5.9 GW of firming.

The system features glass-glass frameless modules with a load-bearing structure delivered with all fasteners required, and a choice of inverters from established manufacturers such as Fronius and Huawei.
The smallest model of the series is a one-car version with a capacity of 4.44 kW, with a construction weight and site being 800 kg and 5,294 mm x 4,370 mm, respectively. A two-berth version has an output of 5.55 kW, measures 5,286 mm x 5,445 mm and has a construction weight of 1,100 kg.
“We have been developing the carport solution for several years. It took time to get all the certifications for safety and durability,” Ramūnas Grudis, Head of Sales, Solitek, told pv magazine, noting that it was necessary to qualify the solar panel-based carport roof as overhead glazing material with the Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik (DIBt).
The carports feature Solitek’s bifacial B.60 glass-glass modules, with 370 W front-side power. The frameless 60-cell panels are made in Lithuania and use PERC cells with a size of 166 mm x 166 mm supplied by an unspecified Taiwanese manufacturer. They also utilize 3mm thick safety glass on both sides. “This is an extraordinarily strong combination,” said Grudis, noting the modules passed 40 mm hail tests.
The modules have an A-class fire safety classification and come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee. The 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.% of the nominal output power.
The carport unit can be designed to withstand a snow load of up to 2.5 kN/m2 and 27m/s of wind loads. Grudis explained that the number of car bays and materials are configurable, in addition to PV-covered terraces, with the same high degree of system integration. The carports can be currently shipped across Europe and are sold via the company’s distributor partners or directly.
Solitek belongs to Global BOD, which also owns ophthalmic lens manufacturing company Bod Lenses. It recently announced plans to build a 600 MW module plant in Benevento, Italy in addition to its 250 MW plant in Lithuania.
This article was amended on 4/12/2023 to note that Solitek is a direct holding of Global BOD, which also owns Bod Lenses, and the factory size in the final paragraph was corrected to 250 MW.

“The Raspberry microcontroller handles the internet connectivity via its inbuilt WIFI module in order to transmit the real-time energy consumption of the electricals and electronic appliances remote control over the internet,” the academics said.
The device also utilizes an algorithm for fuzzy logic to determine variations in frequency and demand. “Our design principally focuses on allocating the users' available electricity,” the researchers said, noting that power and energy consumption of a household's major loads are transmitted via a cloud server to a MATLAB app for monitoring from anywhere.
The tool then sends email notifications with the tariff values to the PV system owners.
“This system could be used for reducing the wastage of electrical energy in the house by proper scheduling and monitoring of the appliances,” the Chinese group said. “Including voltage sensing into the hardware as well as processing it to calculate power can improve the accuracy of this device.”
They introduced the new tool in the study “Smart tariff calculator for feed-in tariff scheme of renewable resources,” published in Measurements: Sensors.

Acciona Energia has announced that it will begin building the AUD 500 million ($330 million) Aldoga Solar Farm in Queensland, Australia, early next year. The Spanish renewable energy developer expects construction of the 380 MW PV plant to be completed before the end of 2025.
Acciona Energia Managing Director Brett Wickham said the solar farm will create a peak workforce of 350 jobs and inject AUD 150 million back into the local economy during the 18-month construction period.
“Acciona Energia have been working closely with the supply chain as part of our local content strategy which will source at least AUD 150 million in work from local companies and suppliers around Gladstone and the Sunshine State to help build the project,” he said.
The entire output of the PV plant, being developed about 20 kilometres northwest of the industrial centre of Gladstone, is linked to a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Queensland’s publicly owned energy company, Stanwell Corp.
Stanwell plans to use all the energy produced at Aldoga to help power the proposed AUD 12.4 billion Central Queensland Hydrogen Hub (CQ-H2) project which would initially involve the installation of up to 640 MW of electrolysers to produce green hydrogen for domestic use and export.
The CQ-H2 project, being built on a 236-hectare site alongside the solar project, is now in the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) stage. Commercial operation for CQ-H2 is scheduled for 2028.
“The Aldoga Solar Farm will be a catalyst for a vibrant hydrogen industry here in Gladstone and we’re proud to finally be getting construction underway,” Wickham said, noting that the project underlines Acconia’s commitment to Australia as a strategic country to accelerate its growth.
The company is also building the 1,026 MW MacIntyre Wind Farm near Warwick in southwest Queensland and developing the adjacent 1,000 MW Herries Range Wind Farm, an expansion of the MacIntyre Wind Precinct that will double the precinct’s total generation capacity to 2 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/04/california-rooftop-solar-installations-drop-80-following-new-net-metering-rules/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 4, 2023",California rooftop solar installations drop 80% following new net metering rules,"From pv magazine USA
California, once a leader in residential solar, is feeling the effects from unpopular policy changes like the introduction of Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 and more recent market rate cuts for rooftop solar generation by renters, schools, and farms. 
The two policy changes cut compensation rates for exporting local, clean solar generation to the grid by about 75%. State regulators said the change facilitating was a necessary evolution in the grid, but opponents argued that the move was a thinly veiled move to protect the profits of major utilities. 
“We are launching the solar and storage industry into the future so that it can support the modern grid. The new tariff promotes solar systems and battery storage with a focus on equity,” said the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) upon passing NEM 3.0. 
“The CPUC’s final proposal is a loser for California on many levels. For the solar industry, it will result in business closures and the loss of green jobs. For middle class and working-class neighborhoods where solar is growing fastest, it puts clean energy further out of reach,” said the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA). 
Which prediction came true? 
Unsurprisingly, gutting the return on investment for solar for homeowners, renters and small businesses in California did not encourage installations. 
Utility interconnection request data shows that solar sales have fallen between 66% and 83% year-over-year following NEM 3.0.  
What’s more, there have been massive layoffs industry wide. CALSSA said over 17,000 solar jobs have been lost in 2023, representing 22% of all solar jobs in the industry.
Based on interviews of residential solar installers across the state, CALSSA found that 59% of installers expect more layoffs ahead, and 63% expect to have cash flow issues over the next three quarters. About 70% expressed concern about their business outlook, while 43%, or about 300 businesses, said it will be difficult to remain in business. 
To meet its clean energy goals, California needs to install 3.5 times as much solar and seven times as much energy storage as what is cumulatively installed today. With minimal demand, layoffs and business closures, it will be very difficult to meet these requirements. 
CALSSA said that short of reversing the decision altogether, there are a few things CPUC can do to repair the damage done. First, it recommends rejecting the Income Graduated Fixed Charge proposed by utilities that would assess minimum bills on all customers, regardless of whether they pull electricity from the grid or not. 
Other recommendations include: 
“CPUC commissioners claimed their decision was about ‘launching the solar and storage industry into the future.’ Instead, they caused the nation’s largest-ever loss of clean energy jobs, pushed once thriving businesses out of the state or into bankruptcy, and derailed California’s fastest and most accessible path to a clean energy future,” said Bernadette del Chiaro, executive director of CALSSA.
