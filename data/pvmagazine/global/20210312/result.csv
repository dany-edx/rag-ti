https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/12/greece-cyprus-and-israel-take-a-further-step-to-link-their-grids/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UTILITY SCALE PV,CYPRUS,GREECE,ISRAEL",ILIAS TSAGAS,"MARCH 12, 2021","Greece, Cyprus and Israel take a further step to link their grids","The energy ministers of Greece, Cyprus and Israel signed this week a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) aiming to boost the implementation of an underground electricity cable that would link the counties’ power grids.
“The ministers agreed to boost cooperation, examining the design and potential development of the EuroAsia Interconnector project,” the Cypriot ministry of energy, commerce and industry said in a statement following the signing of the agreement, which took place on March 8 in the Cypriot capital of Nicosia.
The MoU aims to facilitate cooperation between the energy regulatory authorities of the three countries and the speedy licensing of the project, the Cypriot ministry added.
In a separate statement, the Greek, Cypriot and Israeli energy ministers highlighted that an electricity interconnection between the three countries would boost their contributions towards the Paris Agreement via further renewable energy development.
The interconnector would carry between 1,000 to 2,000 MW of power capacity and is expected to be completed by 2024, with operations starting in 2025.
Israel’s energy ministry said “the underwater cable will be laid in the Mediterranean Sea for about 1,500 km and at a maximum depth of about 2,700 meters,” making it “the world’s longest underwater power cable.”
Specifically, the power cable will be laid over three sections: About 310 km between Israel and Cyprus, about 900 km between Cyprus and Crete, and about 310 additional kilometres between Crete and mainland Greece.
In 2015, the EuroAsia Interconnector was listed as one of the European Union’s Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) selected by the European Commission to step up the bloc's internal energy market.
PCI projects receive EU funds to cover expenses for preliminary studies (e.g. regulatory and environmental studies) and become strong candidate projects for further EU financing, should project stakeholders decide to implement it.
All three energy ministries argue that the Interconnector will boost their renewable energy plans.
Israel’s ministry specifically said the project will “support our ability to significantly increase reliance on solar power generation, and help us meet the government's 2030 solar energy targets.”
Israel is an energy island, meaning it doesn’t currently share any electricity interconnection with any neighboring country.
Last year the Israeli government introduced the goal of generating 30% of its electricity needs via renewables by 2030. Solar PV is expected to contribute most of it, corresponding to 26% of Israel’s renewable electricity in 2030, the government said.
In terms of PV capacity, this means Israel will need to install about 12 GW to 15 GW of new photovoltaic capacity by 2030. This is impossible given today’s electricity grid, which is largely congested. Therefore, Israel is currently aiming to develop a comprehensive energy storage regulatory framework and has also embarked on a series of solar PV-plus-storage tenders. The EuroAsia Interconnetor is an additional solution providing flexibility.
Last but not least, Israel’s parliament legislated an Electricity Market Reform in 2018, terminating the monopolistic nature of the electricity market. Independent private producers currently make up around 40% of Israel’s fossil fuel market, meaning the EuroAsia Interconnector will make for a more dynamic market and allow for more transactions.
Greece does not differ a lot from Israel. It is not an energy island since it shares electricity interconnections with neighboring countries, but these are limited and Greece needs desperately to expand its transnational grid infrastructure.
There are two reasons for this: Firstly, Greece implemented a new electricity market structure in November 2020, adopting the EU’s so-called target model. However, interconnections are a key part of the new electricity design, allowing for transnational and dynamic bidding strategies that lower electricity prices. Greece’s wholesale electricity prices after the implementation of the new market design were higher than expected and one reason might be the lack of greater interconnections.
A second reason is Greece’s recent energy policy shift to phase out coal by 2028 at the latest. According to Greece’s national energy plan, renewable energy systems are set to account for a staggering 61% of Greece’s electricity consumption by 2030. This translates to at least a further 5 GW of new photovoltaic installations by 2030. Greece is also preparing a comprehensive energy storage framework, but it has also embarked on building new interconnections.
Cyprus is the absolute laggard of the three countries. The country has not yet incorporated the EU’s target model design in its electricity market, which remains largely a monopoly. The Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC) holds a near monopoly on electricity generation, generating electricity via natural gas and diesel plants. Today, Cyprus generates only about 10% of its electricity via renewables energy sources, which is the only non-EAC owned electricity generation investment.
Even worse are Cyprus’ targets. The country aims to cover at least 20% of its total energy needs via renewables by 2030. This target is not in line with the island’s natural resources.
Cyprus’ exceptional solar irradiation means the country could at least replace dirty diesel with a combination of solar-plus-energy-storage systems. However, the country does not have a phase-out plan for dirty diesel and is not taking steps to develop a regulatory framework for energy storage.
Nevertheless, the EuroAsian Interconnector is great news for Cyprus, which remains the EU’s last member-state not sharing an electricity link to any other country. Both in terms of its geography and energy system, Cyprus is an energy island. The subsea power link will provide further arguments in favour of renewable power development in the island, but the Cypriot policy-making system appears interested only in fossil fuels.

German solar manufacturer Autarq has announced it will ramp up the capacity of its solar tile manufacturing facility in the eastern German city of Prenzlau, where production started in 2018.
The company says its products have already been used on 205 rooftops in Germany. “The projects range in size from 5 to 8 kW,” a spokesperson from Autarq told pv magazine.
The price for end customers is between €25 and €30 per tile. According to Autarq, a rooftop incorporating its monocrystalline solar tiles may be able to cover up to 70 percent of the electricity requirements of a single-family home.
Each tile has a power output of 10 to 12.5 W, depending on the size, and a power density of 127–135 W per square meter. According to the company, a 5 kW installation would require approximately 500 tiles for a total surface of around 40 m².
Visually, the photovoltaic roof tiles can hardly be distinguished from the original roof tiles. There are also no differences in weight, which is why the roof statics are not affected, according to the manufacturer.
The company also claims that the tile and the PV unit are connected to form a robust component, so that the water flow and tightness of the roofs are preserved. Cables and plug contacts are located under the roof cladding and are thus protected against the effects of the weather.
Autarq also specifies that a photovoltaic system built with the tile is insensitive to shading due to the parallel connection. Skylights, chimneys, ventilation pipes or antennas would also have little influence on the installation and efficient operation of the systems.
The tiles come with a 25-year performance guarantee.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/12/an-aluminum-battery-that-can-charge-in-a-fraction-of-a-second/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,UNITED STATES",MARK HUTCHINS,"MARCH 12, 2021",An aluminum battery that can charge in a fraction of a second,"Aluminum-ion batteries promise significant improvements over today’s lithium-ion technology. The ability to exchange three electrons per ion, compared to lithium’s one, brings the potential for higher storage capacity. Al-ion batteries could also rely on more cheap/abundant materials, avoiding many of the issues that continue to plague Li-ion supply chains.
Various challenges, in particular relating to the shelf-life of the batteries, have kept Al-ion confined to the laboratory for now. New research published in early 2021, however, represents a significant leap in performance for the technology. A battery capable of both high storage capacity and ultrafast charging could open new applications for energy storage, bridging the gap between a battery and a supercapacitor.
Scientists at China’s Dalian University of Technology and the University of Nebraska in the United States collaborated to fabricate a battery consisting of a pure aluminum anode, a graphene cathode, and an organic electrolyte. The batteries are described in the paper Ultra-fast charging in aluminum-ion batteries: electric double layers on active anode, published in Nature Communications.
Key to achieving this performance was an improved understanding of a mechanism known as ‘electric double layers’ – layers just a few nanometers thick which form at the interface between the metal electrode and electrolyte. By dipping the aluminum into Galinstan – a metal alloy that is liquid at room temperature – the group increased the surface energy of the anode allowing more aluminum ions to tunnel through the electric double layers.
With this approach, the group could demonstrate a battery with a 200 milliamp hours per gram (mAh/g-1) capacity, which they claim is a jump forward from the previous record of 120 mAh/g-1 for an Al-ion battery. The battery could also charge at a rate of 104 C – meaning a duration of 0.35 seconds to reach the full capacity at 1000 A g−1.
The group notes that these performance figures denote a device that “eliminates the gap between a supercapacitor and a battery.” And they plan to continue working on understanding more of the specifics of how their anode works, as well as exploring combinations with different cathode materials. Ultimately, they envisage applications in emergency backup power, for example, “energy backup for electric buses that are running between stations, restart a suddenly stopped elevator, or even to minimize the power-off-induced loss in manufacturing or production lines.”

Through a first tender, the GEA wants to select developers to deploy 82 kW of hybrid solar capacity across ten projects in Barima-Waini (Region 1), in the northern part of the country. The projects will include a total of 355 kWh of storage capacity and the ten PV installations will range in size from 2.5 to 30 kW.
A second tender is aimed at seeking developers for the construction of a 150 kW solar micro-grid in Paruima, in the Cuyuni-Mazaruni Region, in northwestern Guyana. The selected contractor will also have to build the transmission system between the solar plant and the buildings and facilities of the local community.
Through another procurement exercise, the GEA wants to build a 50.7 kWp hybrid solar micro-grid for the Iwokrama River Lodge & Resource Center, in Potaro-Siparuni (Region 8), which is also located in the northwestern part of the country. 
Furthermore, the agency has issued a tender for the construction of ten 1.2 kW off-grid PV systems in the municipalities of Advent Acres and Loo Creek, in Demerara-Mahaica (Region 4), in western Guyana, and a tender for an 88.6 kW hybrid solar micro-grid in Sebai, a riverine village in the Matarkai sub-district of Barima-Waini (Region 1).
Moreover, the GEA is seeking developers for a 217 kW PV project at the Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation, a 23kW/115kWh solar-plus-storage installation at the country's Ministry of Finance, and a 111 kW grid-tied PV plant for the Guyana National Shipping Corporation.
All the projects are part of the government plan to bring off-grid solar to remote communities.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/12/a-digital-solarized-vision-for-the-uae/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,MIDDLE EAST,SAUDI ARABIA",,"MARCH 12, 2021","A digital, solarized vision for the UAE","The first virtual Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) Summit 2021, broadcast live around the world in English and Arabic on January 19, attracted over 17,500 registrants from more than 175 countries. The event featured over 90 influential global leaders from government, business, and technology who explored the social, economic, and technological opportunities available in supporting a sustainable green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
During the summit, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) leaders reconfirmed their decarbonization pledges to save the equivalent of 354 million barrels of oil through the deployment of renewable energies. This represents a 23% reduction in oil consumption to reduce the power sector’s carbon dioxide emissions by 22%, according to the latest figures from the International Renewable Energy Association (IRENA).
In his opening address, H.E. Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advance Technology, Special Envoy for Climate Change and Chairman of Masdar, pointed out that with the coronavirus pandemic, society is now witnessing the implementation of digital currencies, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology worldwide. Accordingly, electrification, decarbonization, and digitalization initiatives have become increasingly important “across all industries.” He laid out what UAE is doing in this regard as follows:
New digital technologies require a high consumption of electricity. In the UAE, this is currently predominantly generated from fossil fuels. However, the UAE’s zero emissions by 2050 commitment is heavily reliant on solar energy to diversify Abu Dhabi’s energy sector into renewable sources. Solar energy is seen as an anchor for Masdar’s renewable strategies from many perspectives.
For instance, green energy company Masdar is building the world’s largest solar power plant in Abu Dhabi, because deserts represent some of the best places on earth for harvesting solar power, boasting high levels of solar irradiation and being a rich source of silicon – the raw material for the semiconductors from which solar cells are made.
Another benefit to installing solar panels in the desert, according to a 2018 study, is that they may create a more humid environment which causes vegetation to spread in order to combat desertification.
Developed by Masdar, Abu Dhabi's Masdar City is one of the world's most sustainable urban communities, offering a strategic base through which companies can build their networks both locally and globally, to explore multiple investment opportunities and test innovative new technologies from inception to implementation to help the UAE diversify its economy.
Housing a free zone area, the city has more than 900 organizations – ranging from international giants to home-grown start-ups – that are developing innovative technologies in the areas of energy, water efficiency, mobility, space, blockchain, and artificial intelligence to address the world's most critical sustainability challenges in more than 30 countries.
Digital economy: The UAE Government has made the digitalization of its economy a priority to bring efficiency to government, creativity to industry, and international leadership. To accomplish this goal, it has established the world’s first graduate-level, research-based artificial intelligence (AI) university in Masdar City, The Mohamad bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence – MBZUAI, which welcomed its first students in January 2021.
The UAE has also adopted The Emirates Blockchain Strategy 2021 and The Dubai Blockchain Strategy which has already rolled out several blockchain projects. Emerging Fintech talent and MENA award winner and Blockchain developer Hardik Bhatia, for example, founded SustVest, a crowd-investing blockchain based platform that lets people invest in solar projects and earn returns from consumers who use their funding to put up solar panels. The company is based in Dubai Silicon Oasis Authority, which has built its solution on NEM Blockchain.
“The global rooftop solar segment is booming with opportunities and is valued at over $66 billion. Emerging economies are looking to transition to solar as it offers a green and cheap alternative to conventional energy sources. SustVest enables this transition in emerging economies by crowdfunding rooftop solar projects in emerging economies on its platform,” explained Bhatia.
He added, “We tokenize solar projects granular to the level of individual solar cells, and investors purchasing these tokens can earn dividends generated by the sale of electricity from these individual solar cells. We are opening the gates for retail investment into solar space, and we do so by tokenizing the projects to reduce the barrier of entry and creating a secondary marketplace for providing liquidity to investors.”
Meanwhile, the central bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAECB) is co-developing the world’s first state-backed bilateral central bank digital currency along with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority named “Aber,” Arabic for passing by, crossing, or traveling on a road. Aber has initially been set up to help the UAE and Saudi Arabia make more cost-effective, bank-to-bank, cross-border payments and financial settlements using blockchain technology on a probational basis, and for exclusive use by a limited number of banks, according to the official statements.
 Eventually, Aber will be used globally on China’s Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) which will support future central bank digital currencies (CBDC) from multiple countries, including the UAECB.
A green recovery is imperative for a sustainable social and economic future in the digitalized post-coronavirus pandemic world, said Rt. Hon. Alok Sharma, President of COP26, who also praised the UAE’s undertakings in developing green energy technologies in Masdar City.
Finding financing for this green transition will likely not be too challenging according to H.E. Khaldoon Al Mubarak, Managing Director & Group CEO, Mubadala Investment Corporation and Laurence Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, BlackRock, Inc. the world’s largest asset manager, because a tectonic shift has occurred since the pandemic with the markets pricing climate risk into the value of securities, which is sparking a fundamental reallocation of capital towards sustainable investing to ensure a green recovery in a post-Covid-19 world.
“I believe that the pandemic has presented such an existential crisis – such a stark reminder of our fragility – that it has driven us to confront the global threat of climate change more forcefully and to consider how, like the pandemic, it will alter our lives.…. No issue ranks higher than climate change on our clients’ lists of priorities …We know that climate risk is investment risk … With the U.S. commitment last week to rejoin the Paris Agreement, 127 governments – responsible for more than 60% of global emissions – are considering or already implementing commitments to net zero. Momentum continues to build, and in 2021 it will accelerate – with dramatic implications for the global economy,” said Fink.[1]

While construction work, particularly in the renewable energy plant sector, did not stop during the pandemic, Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc. This week, the coronavirus reached a number of workers of the Solara4 PV plant, the largest solar power project currently under construction in Portugal.
According to Osvaldo dos Santos Gonçalves, mayor of Alcoutim, a Portuguese municipality in the Algarve region, six Covid positives were detected after 50 tests were carried out among the group of workers that are working on the project installation. The project has been partially halted but has not been stopped completely, Santos Gonçalves told pv magazine.
The Solara4 project has a 221 MW capacity and is located near the Vaqueiros district. It is being built by companies and workers from both sides of the Iberian border, including Portwind Lda. Imenergy, Iprocel and B.E.T. Green Energy.
When asked about the completion of the project, the mayor of Alcoutim declared that he could not provide an exact date. “There have been several previous announcements and delays in the inauguration of other projects before, with which we do not dare to indicate a completion date.” pv magazine has received no response from the companies involved in the plant construction.
The Solara4 project was initially described as the largest facility in Europe built without public subsidies. When completed, it will be made up of 661,500 photovoltaic modules from Chinese manufacturer Jetion Solar. Its construction began in March 2017.
Solara4 is being developed by Irish company Welink with funding from Investec and Kommunalkredit funds. According to Welink's announcement, the EPC turnkey contractor is China Triumph International Engineering Co. Ltd (CTIEC). Welink has secured a long-term PPA for the project from Spanish energy company Audax.

There are parts of the world in which basic resources such as water are limited. The authorities in the Canary Islands, for example, are unable to supply all the water needed for the archipelago's population, industry, and agriculture without resorting to techniques such as desalination.
Solar power could be a cost-effective way to power desalination plants in the Canary Islands, but the archipelago has a limited amount of land for PV facilities. A mix of high population density, irregular topography, protected natural areas, and dependence on tourism makes it difficult to install large solar plants, aside from rooftops or the sea.
This is why water-treatment specialist Emalsa, together with Instituto Tecnologico de Canarias ITC and Universidad Europea de Canarias, recently published a study on the design and integration of a floating PV system for the Planta Desaladora de Ósmosis Inversa “Las Palmas III,” which is a desalination plant on the island of Gran Canaria.
The planned PV system is expected to have a capacity of 1.53 MW. It will likely be deployed in the catchment basin of the desalination plant. If it is built, the project would require an investment of around €2 million ($2.4 million) and could help the desalination plant to meet around 3% of its total power demand.
The researchers stumbled upon one surprising finding. If the surface of the water basin is covered with solar panels, variations in seawater temperatures are reduced. The immediate impact of covering the body of water is to improve the efficiency of the reverse osmosis process, by stabilizing the temperature of the seawater throughout the year.
Furthermore, the results of the thermodynamic study, which simulate the coverage of the catchment basin with the floating plant, show the stabilization in the thermal gradient throughout the day, as well as a reduction in the temperature of the accumulated water, with respect to the incoming water mass – up to 0.32 C on the days of highest irradiation and up to 0.18 C when it is less. This effect is also beneficial because it reduces the boron content of desalinated water.
The project, which is still in the feasibility-study phase, shows the enormous potential in the Canary Islands for the deployment of sustainable systems in the water-energy nexus. It also confirms the Canary Islands as a reference territory for the development of innovative projects, exportable to other regions of the world.
A European consortium recently announced plans to build a floating PV plant in the waters off the Canary Islands. The plan involves the Canary Islands Ocean Platform (PLOCAN), Ocean Sun (Norway), Innosea (France), and the Technological Institute of the Canary Islands.

The three plants in Italy would all be in the Apulia region, more precisely, in the provinces of Brindisi, Taranto and Foggia. For one of the projects the authorization request has already been submitted and Saipem intends to do the same for the other two plants “within a couple of months.”
“With reference to the timing, we trust that Puglia [Apulia], having its own specific legislation on green hydrogen, will have an accelerated process and that the process can be completed by 2021,” a spokesperson from Saipem told pv magazine, adding that the authorizations will be formally submitted to the public administrations by Alboran, “but all technical contribution will be joint.”
Saipem said the two companies had identified land for similar projects in Albania and Morocco. “We are now  preparing the permitting in accordance with local legislation,” the spokesperson explained.
The projects will be developed in partnership with Italy-based research center National Energy Technology District and the Sapienza University of Rome. “The agreement with Saipem will allow us to develop the potential of the project model proposed for Puglia with the aim of exporting it to the world,” commented Livio de Santoli, deputy rector responsible for sustainability at La Sapienza University.
Saipem, through its subsidiary Moss Maritime, is partnering with Norwegian oil giant Equinor to test an offshore floating solar array off the island of Froya, near Trondheim, in the Norwegian Sea.
Saipem’s latest announcements follow in the footsteps of a flurry of hydrogen agreements between Italian energy companies. In September, Italian gas and energy company Snam and Saipem signed a deal to cooperate in new energy transition technologies, from green hydrogen to CO2 capture.
Italy's national hydrogen strategy aims for 2% hydrogen penetration into final energy demand by 2030 and up to 20% by 2050.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/12/air-processed-perovskite-solar-cell-with-18-3-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 12, 2021",Air-processed perovskite solar cell with 18.3% efficiency,"A group of international researchers led by the University of Rome Tor Vergata in Italy claims to have developed an 18.3%-efficient methylammonium-free perovskite solar cell through deposition processed in air.
“Thanks to this deposition technique we are able to deposit large area substrates up to A4 size (20x30cm) without using lab scaling technique for perovskite deposition, also avoiding any kind of antisolvent waste,” Luigi Angelo Castriotta, a researcher at the university's Centre for Hybrid and Organic Solar Energy (CHOSE), told pv magazine.
The use of this upscalable technique, which is based on an automatized blade-slot die coater designed by Cicci Research, a CHOSE a spin-off, helps save around 30% of solvents during the perovskite deposition, Castriotta explained. “Solvents usage represent 17% of the total cost of a perovskite device. By using this technique we can reduce this amount up to 6%, providing also an environmental friendly approach.”
A double-cation cesium formamidinium (CsFA) perovskite was air processed by applying potassium doped graphene oxide on top of the mesoporous layer and infrared annealing of the perovskite. “The fabricated devices showed an improved stability test compared to a standard multi-cation perovskite fabricated in an inert atmosphere,” the research team stated.
In the deposition process, potassium-doped graphene oxide (GO-K) was used as an interlayer, between the mesoporous titanium oxide (TiO2) and the perovskite. Infrared annealing (IRA) was utilized to limit charge losses at the perovskite/TiO2 interface.” The fine-tuning of GO-K and infrared annealing have a strong impact on the cell and modules’ performance in terms of efficiency and stability,” the research group emphasized. “These results, obtained in ambient conditions, pave the way towards the industrialization of perovskite solar cell-based photovoltaic technology.”
GO-K is a grey-brown compound in powder form and dark grey in dispersion form, which can be well dispersed in polar solvents. “It is a low-cost material, as its precursor materials are graphite and potassium carbonate (K2CO3), and its dispersion remains stable for more than two months,” Castriotta explained.
Mina M. Styliniakis, a researcher at Greece's Mediterranean University Heraklion, which was also involved in the development of the cell, estimated the overall cost of the proposed synthetic process, taking into account all masses and volumes of the materials used, at around €0.025 per cell. “The preparation of 4 mL of a GO-K dispersion costs only €0.020,” Castriotta affirmed.

Switzerland's Meyer Burger Technology claims that it is on track to successfully complete its transformation from a PV production equipment provider into a module and cell manufacturer in the months ahead.
“The cell factory and the module factory are scheduled to open at the end of May,” the company said on Thursday.
The heterojunction cell production facility, which features the company's own equipment, has been built in Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Germany. Its highly automated module factory, meanwhile, is being built in the former Solarworld factory in Freiberg, Germany.
“For the first time in the history of the solar industry, we have a basic technology that delivers maximum performance and at the same time offers competitive manufacturing costs,” said Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt.
The manufacturer is currently recruiting employees for both manufacturing facilities.
In the first stage of production, Meyer Burger's plants will each have annual capacities of 400 MW. This will require it to hire more than 300 new employees, but it will reduce the number of employees at its Hohenstein-Ernstthal site. It said that 61 Hohenstein-Ernstthal employees have been offered the chance to transfer to the new locations.
Meyer Burger also recently published its 2020 financial results, and its ongoing realignment is reflected in the figures. Sales fell to CHF 90.5 million ($97.3 million) last year, while its gross profit margin reached CHF 37.9 million. However, it recorded an EBITDA loss of CHF 44.6 million and a net loss of CHF 64.5 million.
Meyer Burger plans to increase annual cell production to 1.4 GW in the coming year and aims to double its module production capacity. To do this, it will need to borrow at least CHF 180 million by early 2022 at the latest. It said it expects annual sales of CHF 400 million to CHF 450 million and an EBITDA margin of 25% to 30% in 2023.
The company initially plans to concentrate on the residential and commercial segments for its highly efficient solar modules. The distribution of the modules, which will be mainly conducted via wholesalers, is initially planned in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. However, it also plans to actively sell its solar modules in the Benelux countries, as well as Italy, France, Great Britain, Poland and Northern Europe.
It said it has already concluded its first framework agreements with wholesalers. Its entry into the U.S. market, originally planned for 2022, could be moved forward to the second half of this year, it said.
Meyer Burger plans to hold its initial launch for the new modules in April. It said it also wants to support its positioning in the market by redesigning its own brand.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/12/neoen-secures-first-approval-for-hybrid-wind-solar-storage-project-in-australia/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"MARCH 12, 2021",Neoen secures first approval for hybrid wind-solar-storage project in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
French renewables giant Neoen secured planning approval for the first stage of the $2.3 billion Goyder South project in South Australia this week, according to The Advertiser.
The group aims to win new projects at a pace of at least 2 GW per year over the next four years. If achieved, that would give it more than 10 GW of assets in operation or under construction by year-end 2025, from 4.1 GW at the end of 2020. 
Neoen has timed its aggressive strategy well, as it has been reported that the first stage of what could be 1.2 GW of wind, 600 MW of solar, and 900 MW/1,800 MWh of battery storage has secured planning approval. The project, which should create more than 300 construction jobs and rely on the yet-to-be built SA-NSW Interconnector (Project EnergyConnect), is proposed for sites near Burra, South Australia. 
“Goyder South will not only support South Australia in reaching its goal of net 100% renewables by 2030, it will deliver income security to farmers, as well as jobs to the Goyder region,” Neoen Australia Managing Director Louis de Sambucy told The Advertiser.
The project will be constructed in three stages. The first stage, now approved, will involve the construction of 400 MW of new renewable energy by early 2022. 
“Approval means hundreds of jobs can be created in regional South Australia, boosting the economy as we recover from the global coronavirus pandemic,” said South Australia  Energy and Mining Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan, noting that Goyder South builds upon the South Australia-New South Wales interconnector, which the South Australian state government is working to deliver in cooperation with industry.  
Neoen’s revenues rose by 18% to €298.8 million (357 million) in 2020. The company is clearly now looking to reinvest its profits. It said that a “strong first-quarter increase in storage” was a contributing factor to its 2020 revenues.
Neoen Chairman and CEO Xavier Barbaro said that the company's ambitious plans through 2025 are “predicated in particular on the strong development prospects of the countries in which we currently operate and on the quality of our local teams.” As a way of ensuring capital for this growth, Neoen will adopt a “farm-down policy of selling full ownership or a majority stake in projects in its secured portfolio,” Barbaro added.
This marks a moderation in the company’s long-held “develop-to-own model.” But it's not a full departure, as “assets sold pursuant to Neoen’s farm-down policy will not exceed 20% of the gross annual increase in its secured portfolio.” The two subsequent stages will depend upon the completion of Project EnergyConnect.

Nextracker has settled a patent infringement lawsuit against Ohio-based Northern States Metals, which conducts its solar energy business under the name Solar FlexRack.
California-based Nextracker filed suit in federal court last June.
Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Solar FlexRack will pay Nextracker royalties on qualifying sales revenue from Solar FlexRack’s TDP 2.0 solar tracker and certain related products, services, and components. The other terms were not disclosed.
The lawsuit alleged that FlexRack improperly made use of Nextracker’s patented technology. The patents include “Single-Axis Follower Support System for a Solar Collector” (U.S. Patent No. 9,806,669) and “Balanced Solar Tracker Clamp” (No. 9,970,686).
