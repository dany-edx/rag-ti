Outlining a ten-year, $20 billion strategy, Adani told today's JP Morgan India Investor Summit: “Today, we are already the world’s largest solar power plant [developer], when we account for our generating, under-construction, and contracted project[s]. We’ve done this in just two years and our renewable[s] portfolio has reached our initial target of 25 GW four years ahead [of schedule].”
A team of international researchers has suggested blue hydrogen – powered by carbon capture-equipped natural gas plants – can be compatible with a low-carbon economy, depending on the methane emissions of the gas supply chain and the CO2 removal rate at hydrogen production facilities. Academics from Canada, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the U.K., U.S., and Switzerland, in their paper On the climate impacts of blue hydrogen production, cited low methane emission rates of around 0.3-0.4% in the U.S. gas industry, and around 0.5% in the U.K. and Norway but stated: “In contrast, several gas exporters, like Russia, Algeria or Libya, still have methane emission rates [of] around, or significantly higher than 2%, and will require substantial investments into their existing infrastructure and operations to reach comparably low methane emission levels.”
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
Efficient carbon capture is also critical to ‘low-carbon' blue hydrogen, added the researchers, who wrote: “Our assessment is that CO2 capture technology is already sufficiently mature to allow removal rates at the hydrogen production plant of above 90%. Capture rates close to 100% are technically feasible – slightly decreasing energy efficiencies and increasing costs – but have yet to be demonstrated at scale.” With even renewables-powered green hydrogen electrolysis not truly carbon free, the researchers pointed to the carbon reduction benefits offered by biomass, stating: “Biomass-based hydrogen production represents an exception: adding CCS [carbon capture and storage] to wood gasification and [the] reforming of biomethane can lead to net negative GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions under certain circumstances.”
Spanish energy and infrastructure companies Naturgy and Enagás, together with compatriot logistics business Exolum, have announced plans to develop 50 green hydrogen plants for the national transport network. The ‘Win4Hw' network of plants will be around 300km apart, the partners said in a press release yesterday, adding: “To this end, it is expected to have a green hydrogen production capacity of approximately 4,000 to 7,000 tons per year [at the] first stage, through a scalable design, depending on the evolution of the market.”
German energy company Uniper and Danish wind developer Ørsted have joined forces with Dutch grid company Tennet in a bid to establish offshore-wind powered green hydrogen production from Wilhelmshaven, on Germany's North Sea coast. “By integrating offshore wind and hydrogen, we can significantly support industries such as the chemical, steel or transport sectors in their decarbonization,” said Uniper Hydrogen CEO Axel Wietfeld, in a press release issued by the partners yesterday. Tennet chief operating officer Tim Meyerjürgens said: “Electrolysis must take place where renewables are generated and available in sufficient quantities, namely, primarily on the coasts.” As part of the project, Uniper plans to install a 70 MW electrolysis plant at Wilhelmshaven “from 2025” and aims to expand its capacity to 410 MW this decade.
American hydrogen producer Plug Power, which opened a European base last week, has announced a new production facility in Fresno County, California which will see a 300 MW solar field power a 120 MW Plug Power polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer to produce “30 metric tons of liquid green hydrogen daily.” The company said the planned project would be “the largest green hydrogen production facility on the West Coast” of the U.S. With plants operational in New York, Tennessee, and Georgia, Plug Power wants to produce 500 tons of liquid green hydrogen daily by 2025, and double that figure by 2028, for use in light vehicles, freight and logistics. “Pending environmental and construction permitting approvals, the plant will break ground in early 2023 and complete commissioning in early 2024,” the company said yesterday.
Canadian electrolyzer manufacturer Next Hydrogen Solutions has opened a new, 27,000 square foot assembly plant in Greater Toronto. “This new facility will provide us with an initial 20 MW of annual assembly capacity, which can be significantly expanded in a low-cost fashion as we continue to grow,” said Next Hydrogen president and CEO Raveel Afzaal.

French agrivoltaics specialist Sun’Agri deployed, in 2018, a pilot PV system at the Nidolères wine estate in Tresserre, in the Pyrénées-Orientales department, on 7.5ha of vineyard.
The solar plant was built with 7,800 photovoltaic modules that were installed five meters above the plantations and, according to the company, this is the first agrivoltaic wine-growing operation. “Forty sensors collect around two million data items which are used to intelligently control and tilt the panels, depending on the movement of the sun and the needs of the vines,” said Alexandre Cartier, business manager at Sun'Agri, in a report broadcast on September 16 on France 2.
In periods of sunshine, the shade of the panels thus helps prevent burns on the leaves – which prevents photosynthesis blockages, as well as burns on the bunches, which maintains more aromas and aroma precursors. Furthermore, the purpose of the panels is to avoid excessively high concentrations of sugars, as too much sunshine may produce a higher concentration of sugars, through loss of water. This, according to the project developer, makes it possible to obtain wines with more reasonable alcohol levels.
Moreover, during the first harvest, which took place in mid-September, Pierre Escudié was able to note “half a degree less alcohol” compared to the adjacent hectare plot, where no solar system is deployed. “This is one of the objectives of this experiment: to restore the right balance between acidity and alcohol in the wine,” he said.
Sun'Agri is also realizing seven agrivoltaic installations allocated in a national tender for innovative PV projects, with the support of regional climate and energy body the Agence régionale énergie-climat (AREC) Occitanie.

“Underground hydrogen storage in salt caverns is a safe, efficient and reliable way to store large quantities of energy, also for a longer period of time,” the company said in a statement. “The Zuidwending site in the province of Groningen offers unique conditions for preparing large-scale hydrogen storage for the envisaged development of the hydrogen market.”
The Dutch gas provider explained that it is injecting hydrogen into the cavern over a six-week period and that further tests will be run from November to spring 2022. “The pressure was gradually increased to more than 200 bar,” it specified. “Materials and components required for gas storage were also assessed for their suitability for hydrogen storage.”
If the testing phase is successful, the company plans to make the cavern fully operational by 2026. An investment decision is expected to be made next year. Eventually, Gasunie will build four caverns by 2030, which would bring the site's total capacity to up to 4 GW. “However, Gasunie will have to make pre-investments,” it added. “Among other things, the necessary infrastructure must be ready for an end situation with four salt caverns.” Gasunie added that, in order to use a cavern for storage, large volumes of hydrogen are needed as “cushion gas” to allow the technology to work properly. “In both cases, these are costs that cannot be recovered immediately,” it added.
Gasunie is also part of a Dutch consortium that aims to create a hydrogen exchange market in the Netherlands.
A recent study by the Jülich Institute for Energy and Climate Research (IEK-3) stated that salt caverns offer a flexible, efficient option for hydrogen storage. The research group estimated that Europe has the technical potential to store 84.8 PWh of hydrogen in bedded salt deposits and salt domes.
Most of the continent’s salt caverns, on and offshore, are in Northern Europe. Germany accounts for the largest share, followed by the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark and Poland. There are other sites in Romania, France, Spain and Portugal.
The IEK-3 researchers said the proximity of the caverns to the coast is helpful, as brine disposal remains economical up to 50 km from the sea. The caverns in the Carresse-Cassaber area of southwestern France, planned for the HyGéo project, are around 48 km from the coast.

The scientists created a mesoporous electron transport layer based on optically resonant silicon nanoparticles which were then incorporated into TiO2 paste. “Such particles serve as nanoantennae – they catch light and it resonates inside them. And the longer light stays in the photoactive layer, the more of it is absorbed by the material,” said Sergey Makarov, professor at ITMO’s school of physics and engineering.
The silicon nanoparticles are Mie-resonant, which means they are able to create magnetic or electric resonance based on displacement currents. “Thanks to this effect, the nanoparticles can amplify various optical phenomena, including light absorption and spontaneous radiation. In other words, they do work as nanoantennae,” the researchers stated, noting that including them in the cell improves light absorption without reduction of the active material.
Before using the nanoparticles, the researchers considered the electrophysical and optical properties of all layers and the nanoparticles themselves, especially when they are exposed to external radiation and voltage. They then decided not to apply them to the upper transport layer, which would have prevented the light reaching the nanoparticles, as it would have been absorbed by all the layers below, and placed them, via spin-coating, in the next layer after the perovskite, which brought them closer to the light source.
The Russian-Italian group said the paste can be used with any perovskite cell composition and architecture and that it increases manufacturing cost by only 0.3%. “The paste can be easily applied with other methods, not only with spin coating. It’s a raw universal product that can be used in other types of solar cells, as well as in the production of various devices – photodetectors, harvesters, and optoelectronics,” it further explained. “Such production is also environmentally-friendly, as we don’t use any rare materials.”
The developed cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 21.1%.
The process to produce the paste is presented in the paper Mie-resonant mesoporous electron transport layer for highly efficient perovskite solar cells, published in Nano Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/21/hybrid-pv-thermal-modules-providing-heat-source-to-brine-water-heat-pumps/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",CORNELIA LICHNER,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2021",Hybrid PV-thermal modules providing heat source to brine-water heat pumps,"From pv magazine Germany
René Siegerink is an automation engineer living in Bentelo in the Netherlands who has developed his own concept for the electric heating of the future. On the roof of his detached house built in 1978, Siegerink deployed a PV system and part of the modules were modified to ensure they not only produce electricity but also help to heat the house.
For two years now, the entrepreneur has no longer heated his home with gas, using instead a brine-water heat pump. That would not be a surprise, as such a system is a standard solution, with the brine being heated up with geothermal energy via a borehole and the heat pump powered with solar energy from the roof. Siegerink, however, did not use a hole in the ground. He developed an attachment that he strapped onto the back of the photovoltaic modules as a heat source for the brine-water cycle. He now produces and sells this solution with his company UseAllEnergy.
With this attachment, a heat exchanger, he transforms standard photovoltaic modules into photovoltaic solar thermal (PVT) modules. Such hybrid panels have been around for a long time. However, they couldn’t prevail on a larger scale. One reason for this is that the conversion of a standard PV module would put at risk the manufacturer's guarantee. Another reason is that the water temperatures are not close to the temperatures that pure solar thermal collectors can offer and heat yield is limited to very sunny days. Siegerink was able to solve both problems.
The pv magazine jury recognized the product as a top innovation highlight.

Known as the “Solar Heat Multipanel”, the solution solves one of the problems by not coupling the heat from the modified module directly into the house's heating system, but by using it as a source for the heat pump.  A liquid circles between the heat exchanger on the roof and the heat pump, which cools it down and pumps it back onto the roof, where it heats up again in the surrounding air.  Under this configuration, the thermal unit of the panel can work at lower temperatures than classic solar thermal modules, as it does not need direct sunlight. Furthermore, during the night the heat exchanger warms up from the ambient air and this effect is only possible by not insulating the back of its heat exchanger.
How much thermal energy can be generated is surprising. For example, if the heat pump cools the liquid medium to -10 degrees Celsius when the outside temperature is 0 degrees Celsius, a module can provide 300 W of thermal energy in the dark. But if the sun is shining in such a situation, the heat output increases to 650 W, explained Siegerink. At an outside temperature of 20 degrees, up to 873 W thermally are possible. Regardless of this, up to 380 W of electrical power comes on top when the sun is shining.
The thermal and electrical performance of the module at different temperatures and irradiation conditions is confirmed by the Solar Keymark quality label, which certifies the performance of solar thermal products and hybrid modules. UseAllEnergy claims it is close to being certified by Germany's TÜV Rheinland.
The thermal output of 12 modules is sufficient to supply a heat pump with an output of 6 kW. With a performance coefficient (COP) of 3.5, it requires 1.7 kW of electrical energy and 4.3 kW of environmental heat, which the modules must provide. Twelve modules also provide enough electrical energy to operate the heat pump in a CO2-neutral way throughout the year
Siegerink's heat pump has used an average of just under 3,300 kWh of electricity per year over the past two years. If a system owner wants to increase electricity self-sufficiency in winter, he can easily expand the module field with optically identical modules without a heat exchanger.
As for the issue with the guarantee, Siegerink convinced Chinese module manufacturer Longi that his heat exchanger does not damage the photovoltaic module, but rather increases the electrical performance through the cooling effect it provides. As a result, Longi has accepted UseAllEnergy‘s modifications to its HiMo4 plus module without the customer losing warranty claims.
The installation of the panels is claimed to be very easy. The aluminum heat exchanger with recesses for the connection box is attached to the backsheet with metal clips and can be removed at any time because no adhesive is used. It is only 19 millimeters thick so that it cannot be seen from the side and does not interfere with the usual fastening of the module. All parts of the module remain freely accessible for inspections and maintenance.
In principle, Siegerink's company could also manufacture these hybrid modules from other photovoltaic modules. The production of the heat exchangers is easy and can be converted to other formats at any time, he explained. So nothing stands in the way of series production. His company offers a 25-year product guarantee on the thermal effect and as protection against leaks in the absorber. Retrofitting existing photovoltaic systems would also be conceivable. However, the Solar Keymark label only applies to fully assembled products straight from the workshop.
The Solar Heat Multipanel in combination with brine-water heat pumps can best be compared with the use of air-water heat pumps. According to Siegerink, the performance is similar. Both can be easily retrofitted and require little space. In close proximity, however, the development of noise with air-water heat pumps can be problematic, which is not the case with the hybrid modules.
Siegerink expects the heat exchanger to cost €300 per module, plus installation. With both systems, the efficiency drops when the outside temperature drops and heat can no longer be extracted at -20 Celsius degrees at the latest. The possibility of cooling in summer is also limited at very high temperatures. For new buildings and if space is available, a system owner should consider a small additional underground storage, said Siegerink.
The heat pump can choose the warmer source depending on the outside temperature and the temperature in the buffer. On very sunny days, it can heat up the underground storage tank. On very cold days, the hybrid module may only be able to make a small contribution and most of the energy comes from the ground. If the moisture in the soil freezes in the process, the energy of the phase transition from water to ice can also be used. With an underground storage tank, the heat pump can also heat the modules under certain circumstances in order to prevent them from icing up.

Tata Power's TP Saurya Limited (TPSL) subsidiary has received a letter of intent (LoI) from Maharashtra State Power Generation Co. Ltd (MAHAGENCO) to set up a 250 MW grid-connected solar photovoltaic power plant in Maharashtra, the company announced Monday.
TPSL won the project in tariff-based competitive bidding followed by an e-reverse auction conducted by MAHAGENCO. It quoted a tariff of INR 2.51 (U$0.033) per kWh in the procurement exercise that had a ceiling tariff set at INR 2.83/kWh ($0.038/kWh), valid for 25 years.
The project is to be located at the Dondaicha Solar Park in the Dhule district of Maharashtra, with the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) as the off-taker for the solar plant.
The project is scheduled for commissioning within 15 months from the date of PPA execution. 
With this, the total renewable capacity of Tata Power will reach 4,611 MW comprising an installed capacity of 2,947 MW and 1,664 MW under implementation.

The manufacturer said the solar modules deployed on the vehicle's roofs ensure over 100 km of additional range, with the overall range being estimated at around 400 km. The maximum range from the vehicle's batteries is estimated at between 70 and 280 km/day and the maximum range from solar energy at 130 km/day, depending on geography.
The 23% efficient n-type monocrystalline solar cell technology used was provided by Finnish producer Valoe, with which Clean Motion signed a cooperation agreement in August. Valoe's products are interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cells developed by Germany’s International Solar Energy Research Center Konstanz e.V. (ISC Konstanz), which specializes in IBC technology. The Finnish business began manufacturing its cells in Vilnius, Lithuania, in December after installing IBC production equipment bought from defunct Italian manufacturer Megacell Srl.
“What is unique is the energy efficiency of our vehicles, which means that the solar-roof can make them self-sufficient in energy,” said Clean Motion CEO Göran Folkesson. “It also means that with only 40 kg of batteries we can offer a range of 280 km, which will suit northern latitudes where the sun is not a reliable energy source.”
The vehicle, which the manufacturer defines as ideal for transport missions with a minimal need for charging, has a size of 300 x 140 x 170 cm and, when unloaded, weighs in at only 250 kg. When loaded, its weight can reach up to 700 kg thanks to a cargo space of 2,500 liters. Further technical details of the vehicle were not revealed.
Founded in 2010, the Lerum-based company also produces Zbee, a light electric three-wheeled vehicle that is available either with a rear seat or with cargo space.

The recommendation is one of six key demands made in a report published today which says the U.K. electricity grid is taking too long to become flexible enough to accommodate the volume of renewables needed to reach its target of having a net-zero-carbon economy by mid century.
Pick up your copy of the September edition of pv magazine today for a detailed update on solar and battery storage in the United States, which faces a tough decision between taking advantage of Asian imports, or developing domestic manufacturing at the risk of slowing progress towards decarbonization.
The Energy Transition Readiness Index 2021 report also calls on the government to spend the £950 million (€1.11 billion) it announced a year ago to finance rapid charging of electric vehicles (EVs), and to get a move on with smart charging regulations after it consulted on that subject two years ago.
The study, sponsored by Dublin-headquartered power management company Eaton, compared the U.K. grid to 11 other European national systems and said the British network lags those in Finland, Norway and Sweden because “decisions are regularly delayed or changed and there is weak alignment across government, which means that policy goals are uncertain.”
With the renewables industry body having previously called for more regular clean energy generation auctions, under the government's contracts-for-difference (CfD) regime, today's study also urges policymakers to push for much wider deployment of time-of-use electricity tariffs, which set prices at 30-minute intervals, to help even out demand. Uneven regulation of energy storage, which can still see some systems double charged – both for the energy consumed and dispatched to the grid – should be ironed out, states the report, and the country should see a market for grid flexibility services introduced, with CfD-type auctions included, to drive energy storage capacity.
“Unless the grid keeps pace and is re-framed to become more responsive, it could cost the U.K. hundreds of millions of pounds a year more to transition to renewables, with the burden likely to fall on households and businesses,” said Nina Skorupska, CEO of the Association for Renewable Energy and Clean Technology, in a press release issued by the organization this morning. “It will almost certainly mean that the U.K. will miss its net zero targets too.”

Queensland’s University of Technology (QUT) is working on verifying Titan Hydrogen’s claims its patent-pending technology will “effectively double” vehicles’ driving ranges by enabling a fuel cell to produce more electricity from the same amount of hydrogen.
The Australian-based company claims its technology could increase the capacity of fuel cells by up to 60% and is now bringing the tech into the proof of concept stage in which it will undergo this independent validation process. “The technology facilitates a more efficient electrochemical reaction in the fuel cell, which means more available energy is produced from the same amount of hydrogen,” David Vinson, Chairman of Titan Hydrogen Limited, said in a statement.
Vinson said interim results from the QUT testing process are expected by the end of the year, with the research team led by Andrew Dicks in collaboration with Associate Professor Geoffrey Will. “The development will investigate the fundamental processes occurring within fuel cells using both electrochemistry and analytical techniques to validate fully the Titan fuel cell concept in which a novel nanostructured membrane is at the heart of the fuel cell,” Dicks said. “The aim of the work is to create a new type of hydrogen fuel cell that is not limited by losses caused by the high overpotentials experienced in currently available devices,” he added.
The efficiency of low-temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells is currently low and may convert less than 40% of hydrogen’s energy into electricity. This low conversion efficiency is a vital hurdle for fuel cell technology to overcome to make hydrogen a viable transport fuel. Currently, the ‘round trip’ efficiency of using hydrogen to store electricity can be as low as 50%, compared to batteries which can reach 90%.
Titan Hydrogen, which hasn’t received much press to date, claims its technology marks a “breakthrough” in overcoming this. “The Holy Grail for the hydrogen industry is to figure out a way to use less hydrogen to get the same output of energy. We think our fuel cell technology is on the verge of doing that,” the company’s chairman said.
“If the cells show that they can produce more efficient energy, this will validate our technology and be a great first step for Titan and its investors,” Vinson added. “The technology has application across global automotive, marine and heavy trucking industries. The technology can ultimately be applied to any fuel cell.” Titan is currently undertaking a pre-IPO raise ahead of its goal of launching an IPO and becoming a publicly listed company in 2022.

Whether you’re new to solar, or you’re an industry professional seeking to share the fundamentals with your customers, pv magazine USA’s Solar 101 guide offers essential information and perspective to help you understand the big picture. Each link below links to the most current insight and resources on the topic.
Any rooftop solar installation starts with a couple of key questions that need to be addressed. Is my roof ready for solar? And how will the angle of my roof affect my solar system’s output?
Ideally, solar should be installed on a newer roof. For people in North America, solar should be angled due south to capture the most sunlight. But in reality, homeowners install solar on the home they own, so we show how to decide whether, say, a middle-aged roof that points slightly the wrong way is suitable. (Spoiler alert: solar usually works pretty well, even in less-than-ideal configurations.)

Next, we ask what’s my solar system going to cost? To answer that question, we need to look at the list of unique variables and components in a standard solar project that a homeowner at least needs to be aware of. Once you start to accessorize your rooftop PV with batteries, panels, and EV chargers – the list gets even longer! We take a moment to make sure your solar system is sized correctly to align with your electricity bill and future energy needs.
After determining out-of-pocket costs, we show how to figure your solar system’s payback period. To get a ballpark estimate, divide your project’s costs by its expected annual production output. The caution here is not to overlook federal tax credits, as well as possible state tax credits and incentives. And keep your eye on issues like net metering, whose rules seem to change almost every year.
Admittedly, adding batteries to a residential solar system will significantly slow down the payback period in most states. However, it’s important to remember that there is more value to a residential battery backup system than a simple return on investment calculation may show. As recent grid challenges in Texas, Louisiana, and California have shown, when you really need a backup power source, storage is extremely valuable.

After contemplating all the laws and a few of the important components, we help guide you through the ins and out of how to pay for your rooftop solar. After all, your new solar power system is a 20-year investment, and contractors will accept bank loans, on-the-spot finance, third-party ownership, and even cold, hard cash!
The cost of a solar power system can be high, making the purchase much like buying a car. However, since solar panels pay measurable dividends, it’s more like investing in a financial product. And there are a number of ways to find the money to pay for it.
Not to be overlooked is issues related to the local market, and for some of us that means a Homeowners Association. Here we might encounter a bump in the road, such as grumpy neighbors.
By now, many homeowners are ready to strike up a relationship with a local contractor. To find a good one, take advantage of the resources provided in how to find … and evaluate … a solar contractor for your rooftop project.
Your contractor will help you spec the hardware that you are interested in. When specifying solar panels, it all comes down to curb appeal. Aesthetics are among the most important factors which determine a home’s value, so the demand for beautiful, low-profile or hidden panels is growing.

Just as important as the handsome solar modules, are the brains behind the beauty of your solar power system. Module-level power electronics – known as optimizers and microinverters – maximize electricity generation between strings of solar panels that receive different amounts of sunlight due to angles and shade.
Once you have chosen the hardware, it’s time to determine the best way to attach your solar system to the roof. Your contractor will do the work, but it's good to know how local building codes and risk factors come into play.
Once installed, your solar system represents a long-term investment. You keep your car in good working order, and your solar system benefits from the same sort of TLC. Keeping your rooftop solar system humming over the long term will require some sound decision-making early on. Solar O&M comes down to mechanical rooftop connections, electrical solar panel connections, panel and connection temperatures, and inverters. We present a handful of options to ensure that your solar system remains well maintained through its entire lifetime.
Our final message is simple: go solar, but go with your eyes open. Like all industries, consumers need to pay attention in order to protect themselves. One useful guide is this 24-page Solar Consumer Protection Guide from the California Public Utilities Commission, which is intended to educate consumers about solar leasing and power purchase agreements.
