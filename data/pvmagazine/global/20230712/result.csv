Germany battery manufacturer VoltStorage has unveiled a 50 kWh vanadium redox flow battery that is designed to optimize self-consumption in commercial and industrial PV systems
The VoltStorage VDIUM C50 is an AC-coupled battery with a system voltage of 48 V. The manufacturer offers a 20-year guarantee on the electrolyte and promises that it will degrade less than 0.3% per year.
It also offers a five-year guarantee on the power electronics. The new product comes in a common container and weighs 2 tons without the electrolyte. When fully filled, it weighs 6.5 tons. The electrolyte pumps and power electronics consume 40 W in standby mode.
The system can be cascaded in a 10-unit configuration and reach a total capacity of 500 kWh. The discharge capacity is 9 kW. At full power, the system is empty after six hours.
The manufacturer said that the system, thanks to the redox technology, can achieve a depth of discharge of 100%. When charging the system, operators should plan six hours for 80% and nine hours for 100%. At 10 kW, the charging power is slightly higher than the discharging power.
VoltStorage also said the system features an IP54 protection rating. It recommends installing it in an outdoor environment.

Italian startup Barrel has developed a solar kit for remote areas and conflict zones that can be packed in typical oil barrels. It sells the solution in standard packages consisting of solar modules with a total output of 6 kW, a 5.6 kW single-phase hybrid inverter, and a 3.55 kWh lithium battery.
“At the moment, Barrel is present in several markets, with a particular focus on Africa and the Middle East,” Barrel founder Matteo Villa told pv magazine Italia. “Before the pandemic, we focused on providing electrical services to hospitals, remote care centers and schools. More recently, we have shipped our Barrels to Cuba, Ukraine, Dubai and Oman. In Africa, we are present in countries such as Morocco, Senegal and Mali, and we are developing a hospital project in Angola and Mozambique. Our presence also extends to Nigeria and Ghana.”
Villa said that Barrel also recently worked to support earthquake-affected areas in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna and Turkey.
“Our priority is always to offer immediate and reliable energy solutions in emergency situations, helping communities to recover and rebuild,” he said. “We continue to work with international and local organizations to extend our support into other areas in need of energy assistance,”

The company has a dedicated product line that uses exclusively technologies from Europe and the United States to meet the specific needs of the military supply chain. According to Villa, the enormous challenge consists of organizing integrated management processes for these plants and guaranteeing their maintenance.
“We understand the importance of sourced components to this industry and ensure that our products meet rigorous quality and safety standards,” Villa said. “Thanks to our partnership with reliable European and American suppliers, we are able to provide high quality energy solutions that meet the demands of military organizations.”
Barrel’s goal is not only to provide technology, but also to offer integrated consultancy to develop processes that guarantee the continuity of energy production over the decades within NGOs that manage thousands of energy points.

Base Innovation has developed an agricultural dryer powered by PVT solar panels.
Cogen’Air panels are PV modules that have a heat-recovery system integrated into them. The module uses a heat exchanger that recovers the heat released on the back of the panels for thermal use such as heating or drying. This heat extraction also increases electrical efficiency by avoiding overheating of the PV system. According to the company, the gain in terms of peak power can reach up to 10%.
from the company
The company developed an intelligent regulation system that acts on the speed of the fans based on the humidity level of the heated air. This improves drying while limiting the consumption of the installation. The solution also makes it possible to monitor the operation of the dryer remotely and optimize its production.
Supported by French energy agency Ademe, the system has been patented since 2013 and has mobilized more than €500,000 ($551,000) in R&D over the past 10 years.
Base Innovation currently offers its solution to design or renovate agricultural dryers for bulk drying, bale drying, flat drying or bin drying. In practice, the panels integrate into a ventilation infrastructure with a management system that optimizes the operation of the dryer.
“We have done tests on other sectors of activity,” company's representative Benoît Michenot told pv magazine. “Our solution is interesting for reducing the mass of water and thus reducing the cost of treatment per tonne, but the seasonal constraints inherent in solar energy and the technology of low-temperature drying have limited opportunities in this industry, so far.”
Michenot said the solar dryers offer low-temperature drying which affects the value of the final product.
“The grass can have the same nutritional value as the cereal to feed the animals, provided that it is dried in the right conditions,” he said. “This also leaves room for the development of micro-food chains.”
The company already has 60 solar dryers in operation in France.

Flow batteries, two-chambered devices holding liquid electrolyte, are actively developed across the world as grid-scale energy storage solutions for renewable energy systems.
PNNL has made a significant breakthrough by developing an electrolyte additive called β-cyclodextrin. This additive, derived from a simple sugar used in food and pharmacology, has shown remarkable results in flow batteries. The PNNL team achieved a 60% increase in peak power for a research flow battery.
β-cyclodextrin speeds up the electrochemical reaction responsible for storing and releasing energy in flow batteries. Unlike previous methods, the sugar acts as a dissolved solution rather than a solid applied to a surface, marking a first for flow batteries. The findings, published in Joule, demonstrate the sugar additive's ability to accept positively charged protons, contributing to the balanced movement of negative electrons during battery discharge.
“This is a brand new approach to developing flow battery electrolyte,” said Wei Wang, s PNNL battery researcher. “We showed that you can use a totally different type of catalyst designed to accelerate the energy conversion. And further, because it is dissolved in the liquid electrolyte it eliminates the possibility of a solid dislodging and fouling the system.”
The research aims to reduce the reliance on rare-earth minerals and toxic substances in battery energy storage, promoting a more sustainable approach that mirrors the synthesis methods used in the pharmaceutical and food industries, rather than relying on heavy minerals mining.
Continuing their investigations, the team is exploring alternative compounds akin to β-cyclodextrin but of smaller size. While the addition of the simple sugar thickens the liquid, similar to adding honey to tea, this presents challenges for a flow-based system. However, the researchers concluded that the catalytic advantages of the sugar outweighed the viscosity drawbacks.
This research is part of a larger PNNL program to develop and test grid-scale energy storage technologies. The university is set to open a Grid Storage Launchpad in 2024. Learn more about licensing this PNNL-developed technology here.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/12/assessing-shading-effect-created-by-cleaning-robots-in-solar-farms/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,QATAR",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 12, 2023",Assessing shading effect of cleaning robots in solar farms,"Scientists at the Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI), part of Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), have investigated the impact of the shadow produced by moving cleaning robots on the performance and yield of utility scale photovoltaic plants.
“Cleaning robots are now being used at almost all desert PV plants and, usually, they run during the daytime, which creates a moving shadow on the PV modules,” the research's corresponding author, Benjamin Figgis, told pv magazine. “We did a field study in Qatar to measure how a robot’s shadow affects the PV output in real time, and to see if hot spots were created.”
The scientists conducted a series of tests under clear sky conditions using the commercial robot Nomadd Desert Solar Solutions on different PV array configurations at the QEERI testing facility in Doha, Qatar, with a tilt angle of 22 degrees. They considered three main factors: module design, module orientation, and robot speed.
They specified that the DC current and voltage of the PV string were recorded at 4 Hz, from several minutes before the robot pass to several minutes. The current was measured by passing the string DC cable through a 10 A/75 mV shunt resistor and sensing the voltage drop with the same datalogger. String DC power (P) was obtained by multiplying the voltage and current values.
They explained that the speed of response of the inverter is a main critical factor, as the robot moves quickly over the modules. They also noted that the robot takes the same time to traverse the string regardless of the module type or orientation.
Through their analysis, the academics found that module orientation has an enormous effect on the impact of shadow.
“In landscape, the string current and power dropped severely as the robot passed, whereas strings with portrait modules were barely affected,” Figgis stated. “This was well explained by the layout of modules’ bypass diodes. Happily, there were no signs of cell hot spots, although bypass diodes did heat up if the robot stopped for some time.”
Figgs also explained that, notably, the inverter’s maximum power point tracker (MPPT) algorithm struggled to cope with the robot’s moving shadow – sometimes it increased the string voltage, sometimes it lowered it, and it took around a minute to re-establish MPP after the robot left the array. “For the set-up we tested, one robot pass reduced the day’s PV energy yield by around 0.16% for landscape modules. With portrait modules the loss was nearly zero,” he further explained.
The researchers also found that the decrease in power was larger for full-cell modules than half-cut panels, and that the heating of a module’s bypass diode occurred if the robot stopped on the module, but not while the robot was moving.
“The key lessons were that if a PV plant is being designed with cleaning robots in mind, their shading losses can be minimized by portrait module layout, which is usually the case for single-axis trackers,” Figgs concluded. “For landscape systems, it is best to run robots at night, although before dew has formed.”
The research's findings can be found in the study “Effect of cleaning robot’s moving shadow on PV string,” published in Solar Energy.
The same group published in January a study providing an assessment of the degree to which cleaning robots could threaten the physical integrity of solar panels. They found that cleaning machines have a very minimal impact and that modules of similar sizes tend to exhibit roughly the same amount of vibration.

Japan’s Sumitomo Corp. will build a 2.5 MW renewable hydrogen pilot plant in Gladstone, Queensland, as part of Rio Tinto’s plans to trial the use of hydrogen as a replacement for gas in the calcination process.
Rio Tinto, which is trying to minimize carbon emissions at its Yarwun alumina refinery, said the Yarwun Hydrogen Calcination Pilot Demonstration Program will be a first-of-its-kind deployment of hydrogen calcination technology.
The project will consist of a 2.5 MW onsite electrolyzer, a hydrogen storage facility, and the retrofit of a hydrogen-capable burner to one of the refinery’s four calciners, which are the large industrial ovens used in alumina refining. The project will be co-funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).
Sumitomo will own and operate the 2.5 MW electrolyzer and supply the hydrogen to Rio Tinto. No details about the power source for the plant were provided, but Sumitomo said the electrolyzer will have an annual production capacity of more than 250 tons of renewable hydrogen.
The company said it has already completed its front-end engineering and design study (FEED), with construction set to start in 2024. The hydrogen plant is expected to be commissioned in 2025.

Innovation has proven to be the engine powering the global energy transformation towards a carbon-neutral future.
But innovative efforts should not only focus on the supply side of energy systems, where we have already witnessed significant progress in the last years — wind and solar show remarkable growth pace over the last years – but also on the demand side. By embracing smart electrification and integrating more solar photovoltaic (PV) power, we can revolutionize the way we consume energy and achieve a sustainable and resilient energy system. In this column, we will explore the benefits and opportunities presented by smart electrification, highlighting the role of solar PV integration in transforming our end-use sectors.
Electrifying End-Use Sectors
Both direct and indirect electrification with renewable power offer feasible solutions to electrify many end-use sectors thanks to sharp cost reductions for wind and solar technologies. Electricity consumption is expected to increase from the current 22% to 51% of final energy consumption in 2050, out of which 91% will be produced from renewables, according to IRENA analysis.
A Systemic Approach to Innovation is not only smart, but critical
Yet, the transport and heating sectors are still largely based on fossil fuels. To tackle this challenge, the transformation towards an electrified energy system, must follow a holistic and smart approach. Otherwise, we will miss out on the opportunities offered by cleaner and affordable renewable energy generation and overload the power grid. A systemic innovation approach goes beyond technological innovation and merely substituting one technology with another but includes innovations in market design, system planning and operation, and business models. Only by matching and leveraging synergies in innovations in all parts of power system and end-use sectors and including all relevant actors and stakeholders, successful solutions can be implemented on the ground.
To help turn this new paradigm into reality, IRENA’s new Innovation Landscape Report for Smart Electrification identifies 100 key innovations across three transformation avenues: power-to-mobility, power-to-heat and cooling, and power-to-hydrogen. Smart electrification offers a cost-effective pathway to decarbonize energy systems. By electrifying energy end-use sectors and managing these loads in a smart way, we can unlock flexibility in the power system, to integrate large shares of variable renewables. Therefore, smart electrification provides three key benefits:
Harnessing the potential of photovoltaics
The Innovation Landscape Report is a toolbox for policymakers to design smart electrification strategies, tailored to their own context.
The characteristic features of Solar PV bring major benefits to the energy transition when being integrated smartly into the energy system. The report identifies several “blind spots” – issues that are sometimes overlooked and can hinder the success of smart electrification strategies or have the potential to accelerate electrification. One of them is that co-locating EV charging points with solar generation can minimize the impact on the grid. Peak solar generation occurs in the middle of the day when most passenger vehicles are parked. Workplace charging, combined with solar photovoltaic rooftop arrays and solar canopies over parking lots can decrease the overall EV load on the grid. Furthermore, off-grid solar charging systems can accelerate the switch to EVs in places with low-capacity grids, avoiding the need for costly grid expansion.
In the heating and cooling sectors, an important blind spot is the temperature as the critical variable. Distinguishing between low temperature needs in buildings and district heating, and high temperature needs in industrial sectors, is crucial. Another ‘blind spot' brings attention to the growing cooling demand and its synergies with solar PV integration, which need to be considered in energy planning. Reversible heat pumps supply cooling at low additional cost make thermal networks more efficient and profitable because they can provide services throughout the year. Since peak cooling demands and peak solar energy occur simultaneously, the growing cooling demand can be coupled with solar PV and ease the increasing solar PV’s penetration. Arizona County demonstrated that 55% of the electricity demand for cooling can be met by solar generation. Even a larger share of this demand could be met if buildings were pre-cooled during the sunniest hours, taking advantage of buildings’ thermal storage capabilities. However, effective energy planning measures are required to meet the greater cooling demand in the most cost-effective ways.
Similarly, in Nigeria, for example, the proposed ice-based energy storage with solar PV-powered refrigeration can reduce energy consumption by up to 40% in a cooling-as-a-service business model.
These examples show how systemic innovation is essential to electrify our energy system in a smart way, maximize the potential of wind and solar generation and avoid locked-in decision-making that will delay the decarbonization of our energy systems.

It is particularly interesting in densely populated countries with limited land areas for further conventional PV installations. More generally, PV installations in the built environment provide electricity close to centers of consumption, reducing the need for additional grid infrastructure. However, the global BIPV market has faced slower development than anticipated, partly due to the complexity of building standards and codes. In particular, fire safety building standards present a significant challenge and have acted as a barrier to the development of the BIPV market. This article explores the complexities surrounding fire safety standards, the role of testing laboratories, and the efforts made by IEA PVPS Task 15 to address these challenges.
Diverse Fire Safety Standards
One of the key obstacles facing the BIPV industry is the wide array of fire safety standards that exist across different countries and regions. On the one hand, BIPV installations must comply with specific fire safety regulations, which vary greatly depending on the location and the local building tradition that has evolved there, often over centuries. On the other hand, there are certain classification requirements that apply globally. This creates a complex landscape where it becomes vital for manufacturers and suppliers of BIPV products to understand and adhere to a multitude of standards in different markets, and to recognize that the fire safety testing of conventional PV products is already deficient with regard to BAPV applications and is certainly not sufficient for BIPV products.
Navigating Testing Laboratories
To guarantee compliance with building-related fire safety standards, BIPV products must undergo rigorous testing. Testing laboratories, situated in various countries, play an essential role in assessing compliance with regional standards. However, for suppliers of BIPV products, identifying the appropriate testing laboratories can be a daunting task. The global nature of their operations further compounds this challenge, as they manufacture products in one country and install them in several others. Streamlining the process of locating accredited testing laboratories could help to alleviate this burden.
IEA PVPS Task 15 report provides international mapping of testing laboratories
Task 15 recently published the report: “Fire safety of BIPV: International mapping of accredited and R&D facilities in the context of codes and standards, 2023”.  The report provides a concise overview of currently used standards in different parts of the world as well as a description of regulations pertaining to fire safety in several important markets. It also presents more than forty testing laboratories around the world where construction products and materials are tested for fire safety. These laboratories are confirmed to have a common interest in the assessment of BIPV products and systems, even though not all of them may have any experiences of it so far.
The report serves as a valuable resource for BIPV suppliers, architects, and project managers, offering guidance on navigating fire safety standards and identifying reliable testing laboratories. However, it is important to note that while the report maps out the testing labs, many of them focus on products and materials and more seldom assess additional risks that arise from combining products into larger structures in buildings.
The Complexity of BIPV Fire Safety
The core issue lies in the complexity of BIPV fire safety, which requires industry guidelines from building regulatory bodies. To resolve this issue, collaboration between building regulatory bodies, building surveyors, fire engineers, façade engineers, fire rescue commissions, and testing laboratories is essential. By bringing together these stakeholders, a collective effort can be made to develop comprehensive guidelines that address the intricacies of BIPV fire safety.
Recommendations on test configurations
The paper, “Fire safety requirements for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV): A cross-country comparison,”[1] which was written collaboratively by experts from Task 15, provides valuable insights into the multifaceted nature of fire safety requirements, highlighting the need to satisfy both electrical and building-related aspects. It contains specific recommendations on test configurations to test BIPV components or estimating the hazard of a system that remains operating when a fire occurs. Further research should also be conducted on the impact of toxic smoke from BIPV modules based on tests or comparison with the composition of existing building components.
Contributing to the future of BIPV
The integration of photovoltaic technology into building facades and roofs must not compromise the safety of construction products, occupants, and firefighters. Prioritizing comprehensive fire safety guidelines, fostering collaboration among industry stakeholders, and adhering to international standards will ensure that the BIPV market can thrive while utmost safety in the built environment is guaranteed. As a valuable side-effect, traditional (BA)PV installations will also enjoy a higher safety level with respect to fire, as many of the same fire safety challenges are relevant for both BIPV and BAPV.
The third phase of Task 15, to extend international co-operation on BIPV topics for four years, is currently in the planning phase. Conducting pre-normative collaborative research within Task 15 can be one way of influencing BIPV standardization, as co-operation with formal standardization bodies is well established. In case you are a potential participant of Phase 3 of Task 15, please contact the Task Co-Managers. Phase 3 will address the topics of “Challenges and opportunities of BIPV in a de-carbonized and circular economy”, “BIPV in the digital environment”, “BIPV products, projects and demos: innovation and long-term behavior”, “BIPV training, dissemination and stakeholders’ collaboration”, “BIPV characterization & performance: pre-normative international research”, and “Activity devoted to the Fire Safety of BIPV.”

“We are considering commercial production in the future,” the corresponding author, Guido Vallerotto, told pv magazine. “For the moment, we are still improving several aspects of the simulator. The version we used for the characterization in the paper is not ready for commercialization, even if practically it is fully operational and functioning.”
In a test of a module with a radius of curvature of 1 meter, the research team found that their solar simulator’s measurements of the short-circuit current of the cells followed the ideal cosine response of the curvature with differences lower than 0.5%.
It also ascertained that a non-collimated light source, typically used in conventional solar simulators for flat modules, had a non-uniformity boost of between 2% and 20%, depending on the module. The intrinsic lack of uniformity under normal irradiance caused by the curved shape is boosted when it is illuminated with a non-collimated light source, said the researchers.
The researchers tested their solar simulator solution on one flat panel and three curved modules, with radii of curvature of 3m, 2m and 1m, respectively. The modules were equipped with 32 metal wrap-through (MWT) cells with eight strings of 4 cells. Each string was measured independently and compared to the expected cosine response.
The team defined the location of the light source, the type of light source, and the length of the pulses. They chose a Helios 3198 solar simulator, originally developed to characterize concentrator photovoltaics (CPV), and adapted it to their proposed design. The light pulse power supply and electronics were modified to accommodate the slower time response of conventional silicon cells.
The setup included a black tunnel for stray light rejection, including the baffles and light trap box, and chambers. The design of the tunnel is critical to achieving an irradiance non-uniformity better than 1%, said the researchers. Light-trapping chambers closer to the lamp and baffles distributed along the tunnel are needed to effectively suppress the stray light and ensure that only the light reflected by the collimating mirror reaches the measurement plane.
The simulator is based on a multi-flash approach with the Xenon flash lamp triggered while the module is biased at a different voltage at each flash pulse, recording different pairs of current-voltage points during the pulse decay. The illumination system consists of a round collimator with a diameter of 2 m and a focal distance of 6 m, and a small toroid flash lamp of 65 mm in diameter to derive a collimated beam with a divergence of 0.3 degrees, resembling the direct normal irradiance (DNI) at outdoor conditions.
The design of the solar simulator, setup, and test results are presented in the paper “Collimated solar simulator for curved PV module characterization,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.

H&S Properties has hired SolarEdge to install a solar carport and rooftop array on a research and development campus in Redwood City, California. The facility is expected to lower on-site costs for electricity and cut carbon emissions, making the research center a more attractive location for businesses looking to cut costs and environmental impact.
The 623 kW system is expected to offset 78% of the research center’s total energy use and provide its four tenants a 10% discount of electricity. The SolarEdge DC-optimized system is forecast to produce 950,000 kWh per year. MYNT Systems installed the array.
“For building owners, the biggest issue keeping them up at night is the thought of properties lying vacant. Providing access to sustainable, lower-cost energy is incredibly appealing to prospective tenants,” said Robert Hymes, chief development officer, MYNT Systems.
MYNT Systems installed a 623 kW solar system at the research center, which is expected to offset 78% of its energy use and provide a 10% electricity discount to its four tenants. The system features 1,299 bifacial solar modules, SolarEdge power optimizers, inverters, and a battery for energy storage. The optimizers overcome shading, module degradation, and soiling issues, while also allowing for design flexibility in module layout and placement to maximize productivity.

PEDA is seeking prospective developers to set up 100 MW of floating solar projects of different sizes across Punjab. The projects are to be developed on a build-own-operate basis.
PEDA said it plans to collect information about the feasibility of floating PV projects. It will select developers by launching a tender. It said it “intends to collect information about the feasibility of floating PV projects and interact with prospective developers in the market to enable PEDA in the formulation and calling of bids for the selection of floating PV developers on a build-own-operate basis.”
Power generated from the projects will be procured by the state electricity distribution company on a long-term basis at a tariff determined through the bidding process.
In another development, Rajasthan Electronics and Instruments has started accepting bids to set up a total of 50 MWp of grid-connected solar plants at government buildings in various Indian states and union territories. The developer will also be responsible for providing 25 years of operation and maintenance support.

“The offer submitted by Clementy Group is, indeed, significantly more beneficial compared to the others received meanwhile, for the company, for its employees and for its creditors, both in terms of immediate liquidity as well as of recapitalization and of safeguarding company assets,” it said. “The acquisition by the British investment company will provide Fimer with the financial resources necessary for the continuation of the activity.”
Fimer did not provide any additional financial details about the transaction.
In late April, Clementy Group decided to cancel its initial €95 million ($104.8 million) investment proposal for the Italian company, citing the failure of Fimer's shareholders to issue the necessary shares.
Fimer announced an industrial relaunch last September after entering composition-with-creditors proceedings at a tribunal in Arezzo, Italy. The company filed for creditor protection with the same court in February. It presented its new industrial plan to the tribunal in late June 2022.
According to Italian legislation, the composition-with-creditors procedure is a contractual settlement between a debtor and its creditors. The arrangement gives a business the chance to restructure its debt obligations and continue as a going concern.
Fimer operates two inverter factories in Italy and one in India.

It first launched the tender in May 2022.
The proposals came from Saudi Arabian energy giant ACWA Power, French utility EDF, Japan's Marubeni, and a consortium formed by China-based Jinko Power and Japanese energy producer JERA.
“EWEC received 43 expressions of interest from potential bidding companies and consortiums, with 19 qualifying for the RFP stage after submitting Statements of Qualification,” EWEC said. “Moving forward, the proposals will undergo a detailed technical and commercial evaluation process to select the best proposal. The awarding announcement and the execution of the power purchase agreement are expected to take place by [the fourth quarter of] 2023.”
In January, the utility said it would sign a long-term power purchase agreement with the selected developer. The PPA will be structured as an energy purchase agreement, under which EWEC will only pay for the net electrical energy supplied by the solar plant. It did not reveal a deadline for proposals on its channels.
In the latest issue of pv magazine we turn the spotlight onto European solar with a comprehensive review of the state of the PV industry across the region’s key markets and a look at the legislation which aims to drive a solar rooftop boom. We also examine the difficulty of establishing a solar panel recycling industry in Australia, where industry backbiting isn’t helping matters.
Bidders will be expected to handle the development, financing, construction, operation, maintenance and ownership of the plant. The winning developer will take up to a 40% stake in the project, with the remainder to be indirectly held by the government of Abu Dhabi.
