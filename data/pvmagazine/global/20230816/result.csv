Sydney-based developer Genex Power says that construction of the 250 MW/2 GWh Kidston Pumped Storage Hydro Project in Queensland is progressing at pace, with underground construction work expected to be completed by the end of this year.
The pumped hydro storage facility being developed in the abandoned Kidston gold mine, about 380 kilometers west of Townsville, is part of the AUD 777 million ($500 million) Kidston Clean Energy Hub, which includes an operational 50 MW solar farm and 258 MW of wind power.
The pumped hydro facility will provide up to eight hours of continuous energy for the grid. It is expected to be completed in the second half of 2024, with plans to put it online in 2025.
EnergyAustralia has already entered an off-take agreement with Genex to use the deep storage capacity, most likely at the end and start of each day, when renewable energy output is at its lowest.
Genex says the roof of the powerhouse cavern, located 250 meters below the surface, is now on. Once completed, the cavern will be 80 meters long, 18 meters wide, and 45 meters high. It will house two reversible turbines capable of generating 250 MW of rapid response renewable energy.
“We’re already past the halfway mark,” Genex said, noting that the project “is creating significant work opportunities, boosting the supply chain, and fostering manufacturing prosperity.”
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the clean energy hub is contributing to the creation of 900 direct jobs, and will help the Australian state to achieve its renewable energy targets of 70% by 2032 and 80% by 2035.
“Once operational, Kidston pumped hydro will generate enough energy to power towns the size of Cairns, Townsville and Rockhampton for eight hours each and every day,” he said.

In the United States, a PPA agreement was announced for the 50 MW Macho Springs solar farm in New Mexico, whereby First Solar would sell the power generated to El Paso Electric Company at a record price of US$ 57.90/MWh. According to market data at the time, the $0.0579 per kWh is less than half the average price of power generated by new coal-fired plants (12.8 c/kWh) and significantly less than the typical price of power generated by PV projects using thin-film modules (16.3 c/kWh, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance -BNEF- figures).
 
In Spain, more PV FIT cuts were announced: following the introduction of a new energy tax in early 2013, producers faced more problems with the feed-in tariff (FIT), which would materialize later, as developed in this article.
In February, the Valencian company Siliken S.A., one of the largest players in solar-grade silicon production and PV equipment manufacturing in Spain, filed for insolvency proceedings in Valencia's Commercial Court No. 1.
The ill-fated Valencian solar developer reported annual sales of 331 million in 2010 and 255 million in 2011. The company employed some 1,100 workers in its best days.
Isofoton also drew up a workforce restructuring plan for its Malaga factory, after which 380 of its 700 employees were affected. The supplier Lamaignere claimed that Isofoton owed more than seven of its suppliers more than 3 million euros.
 
According to a report by EnergyTrend, the research division of market research firm TrendForce, shipments by the Taiwanese PV cell industry reached a record high in 2012, with 5.5 GW of cells shipped worldwide.
Four key players dominated PV cell shipments, with Motech, Gintech, Neo Solar Power and Solartech accounting for 67% of the shipment volume. Both Motech and Gintech shipped more than 1 GW of cells in the year, and companies such as Topcell, DelSolar and Tainergy each shipped between 300 and 350 MW.
“As evidence of fierce price competition caused by oversupply, while shipments increased by 5% to 25% among Taiwanese cell producers, revenues declined by 25% to 50%,” the report said.
EnergyTrend expects Taiwan's cell shipments to break records again in 2013, due to U.S. and European trade disputes with Chinese manufacturers and a booming PV market in Japan. Revenues will remain at roughly the same figures as in 2012.
 
In a report published in February 2013, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) predicted that large-scale PV systems will supply cheaper power than coal and gas by 2020 in Australia.
The results of BNEFs Sydney analysis team, which modeled the cost of generating electricity in Australia from different sources, predicts that the Australian economy can expect more and more electricity generated from renewable energy sources, as new coal plants are “simply too expensive.”
The BNEF study found that electricity from a new wind farm can currently be supplied for A$134/MWh, compared to $143/MWh from a new coal plant.
For PV, BNEF claimed that costs had fallen by 29% since 2011. By 2020, it predicts, large-scale PV will also be cheaper than coal and gas, when carbon prices are factored in. “In 2020-30 we will find new and innovative ways to deal with the intermittency of wind and solar, so it is quite conceivable that we could jump straight from coal to renewables to reduce emissions as the carbon price rises,” it said.
 
According to a report published in February by London-based research firm GlobalData, the PV market was expected to more than triple between now [2013] and 2020, a year in which the cumulative global capacity of installed PV systems will soar from around 97 GW in 2012 to 329.8 GW, “capping an eight-year period (2012-2020) during which the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) reaches a strong 16.5%.”
As an example, Germany would reach, according to its forecasts, 48 GW by 2020. On China, it noted how Asian companies already dominated the global PV device supply scene, with five Chinese companies among the world's top ten module manufacturers. “In the People's Republic, aggressive capital subsidies are given to PV projects that fall under the Solar Photovoltaic Construction program and the Golden Sun program, which cover a wide range of solar PV applications,” it said.
“At present [2013], China exports more than 90% of its production capacity. However, the Asian leader is also expected to significantly increase domestic solar module installations in the near future, with a massive increase in installed capacity from 7.6 GW in 2012 to 70 GW in 2020”, says the report.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/16/robomapper-platform-for-perovskite-solar-materials/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",VALERIE THOMPSON,"AUGUST 16, 2023",RoboMapper platform for perovskite solar materials,"A team from North Carolina State University, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and Rey Juan Carlos University recently published the details of RoboMapper, a novel robotic materials discovery platform. The novel materials acceleration platform (MAP) can identify viable candidates for perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells.
“The target bandgap was ∼1.7 electron volt (eV) within mixed-cation, mixed-halide perovskites composition areas,” North Carolina State University researcher Aram Amassian told pv magazine.
The researchers validated new wide-bandgap compounds by analyzing RoboMapper-generated samples and spin-cast thin film samples, as well as through the fabrication of solar cells. They translated a predicted ideal compound, extensively detailed in the paper, into a champion device exhibiting an open-circuit voltage of 1.18 V, a short-circuit current of 21.54 milliampere per square centimeter, and a fill factor of 78.83%, for a 20% power conversion efficiency. The researchers said that devices with the new perovskite alloys show lower hysteresis and better photostability than other compounds evaluated at 1.7 eV.
It was important to the research team to demonstrate both environmental and productivity benefits.
“The RoboMapper can generate large datasets at a small fraction of the time, cost, and environmental impact of existing platforms, making it possible to develop new materials 10 times faster than traditional automation,” said Amassian. “There is a clear value proposition for anyone in the functional materials discovery space looking to do it competitively, responsibly, and sustainably.”
Amassian said that the team is actively pursuing partnerships to bring RoboMapper into commercial use. They have used the RoboMapper to define compositional boundaries, particularly where novel materials could demonstrate stability and efficiency. Amassian said RoboMapper's proficiency in this area could have implications for intellectual property in relation to new materials for PV, optoelectronics, and other functional applications.
The RoboMapper system uses a library of perovskite inks, which are perovskite film precursors or salts suspended in a solution, for easy deposition. It prepares the precursors inks, mixes, and loads the materials for deposition on chips (or substrates) for analysis and data collection.
The aspiration, mixing, and cleaning steps are automated. The samples undergo a battery of tests to evaluate the structure, bandgap, light stability, and level of suitability for PV applications. In parallel, the information is processed into models that are used to predict new perovskite compositions.
The tool can integrate hundreds of pixels per square centimeter, with an average pixel size of 50 micron diameter, according to the researchers. In this case, they palletized up to 150 compositions, with copies made for verification of reproducibility.
Amassian said there are several semiconductor-oriented mapping tools in development in academic and industrial research laboratories throughout the world.
“The prototyping platforms have applications in PV but also in printed electronics and other semiconductor applications in communications, displays, sensing and flexible electronics,” he added..

GreenAkku, a German solar module supplier for balcony applications, has developed its new L-base solution to simplify the installation of PV systems on flat rooftops, garages, carports, and gardens.
The L-base, which is made of exposed concrete, is manufactured by Wattstone. It serves as a foundation for the solar modules, allowing direct installation with threaded sleeves. Each L-base weighs 24 kg, eliminating the need for additional weighting or fastening to withstand wind and weather, as confirmed by wind tunnel tests.
The cost for a single L-base is €57.90 ($63.40) plus shipping, with options for cheaper packs of two or three. The solution eliminates the need for drilling and offers protection for underlying surfaces through anti-slip pads.
GreenAkku says that the L-base is applicable for small and larger PV systems, with a 10-degree tilt to orient modules toward the east or west. The solution permits adaptable adjustments to system layout, eliminating the need for standard assembly procedures.

In the study “Feasibility study of solar photovoltaic/grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system with pumped storage hydropower system using abandoned open cast coal mine: A case study in India,” published in the Journal of Energy Storage, researchers from the Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology investigated the business case of a similar approach for a mine located on the bank of India’s Godavari River, in the Karimnagar district.
“Our work is mainly concerned with pre-feasibility study,” corresponding author, Ambati Bhimaraju, told pv magazine. “The cost of the system is estimated based on some reference journals.” The use of abandoned mines for such mechanical storage is not new, but the novelty of the research is its use of an open-cast coal mine, which is essentially an enormous crater.
The system described in the study is based on a classic pumped hydro storage system, in which surplus energy created by the PV is used instead to pump water from a lower reservoir to a higher one, that in turn uses a hydropower turbine to create energy in times of low solar power generation or at night.
The proposed system configuration considers the river as the upper reservoir, which they say results in considerable savings on construction costs. The researchers assessed the cost of such a project at $188 million, where $91 million is invested in the solar plant and $85 million is devoted to the pumped storage hydro-power plant (PSHP).
The solar plant is assumed to have a maximum capacity of 50 MW and to devote around one-fourth of the energy it generates to the pumped hydro station.
According to the calculation of the scientists, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of this project in India may be $0.2693/kWh. They also considered unexpected changes and said that in the case of a 10% solar panel outage, the LCOE rises by 19% to $0.320/kWh. In the case of a 10% increase in CapEx, the LCOE is adjusted to $0.3177/kWh, while in the case of a 10% reduction in CapEx, the price drops to $0.2491/kWh.
“The positive net present value (NPV) of 16.408 million USD indicates that the system is economically viable, making the proposed project financially feasible in the chosen case study location,” the paper notes. “PV-PSHP system is a feasible and scalable solution for fulfilling future electrical needs at a selected site, and the suggested method in this work successfully executed the considerable cost-effective solution.”

“The layer consists of an indium tin oxide (ITO) stack,” the research's corresponding author, Özde Kabakli, told pv magazine. “It is a thin highly doped ITO interlayer between tin SnOx buffer layer and moderately doped ITO. With the ITO stack, both high transparency and conductivity can be achieved. The optical adjustments mainly increase the short circuit current density and the efficiency of the tandems.”
The academics improved the quality of the ITO film by fine-tuning the oxygen flow rate during the sputtering process, which was carried out with a power density of 0.4 W/cm2, a chamber temperature of 50 C, and Argon as the sputter gas. The oxygen deficit of the layer was combined with moderate doping.
They built the tandem cell with an ITO substrate, the SnOx buffer layer, a buckminsterfullerene (C60) electron transport layer, a perovskite layer, an interfacial layer made of the PFN polymer, a hole transport layer (HTL) made of poly-triarylamine (PTAA), the ITO stack, a p-type silicon layer, another ITO layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
“The silicon bottom solar cell has planar front and random pyramid texturing at the rear side,” they explained. “The ITO layer is changed between two groups while keeping the rest of the stack the same.”
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.6% and a fill factor of up to 76%. “The improvement in electro-optical properties of the optimized ITO layers result in a good combination of moderate sheet resistance and low absorptance,” the German team emphasized.
The cell technology was introduced in the paper “Minimizing electro-optical losses of ITO layers for monolithic perovskite silicon tandem solar cells,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. Looking forward, the scientists said they want to apply the proposed multi-stack approach to fully textured perovskite silicon tandem devices.

Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0 has shifted the environment for rooftop solar in California by sharply cutting compensation rates for exporting local solar generation to the grid. This change, combined with rising interest rates, has posed some new challenges for rooftop solar installers, and new solutions are arising to ensure customers get a solid return on investment.
Enphase, the nation’s largest supplier of microinverters, announced it released updates to its product offerings that are designed to optimize return on investment under the NEM 3.0 environment. The release includes new configurations for the operation of its microinverters and batteries, as well as an NEM 3.0-focused feature in its Solargraf design and proposal software platform.
“Our financial analysis shows that with solar and batteries, homeowners can expect bill offsets between 70% and 90% and a payback period between 5 and 7 years for a cash system,” said Mehran Sedigh, vice president and general manager of the storage business unit at Enphase Energy. “These are compelling economics for homeowners, and we believe installers can thrive under NEM 3.0 with Enphase Energy Systems.”
Under NEM 3.0, the value of buying and selling electricity varies greatly by the time of day and month. The rules incentivize solar-plus-battery owners to avoid buying electricity during times of high utility demand, while compensating them for exporting during these peak demand hours. Enphase’s NEM 3.0-focused system enables homeowners to configure their systems to automatically self-consume and sell energy at optimal times, while retaining backup power reserves for times when the grid is down.
The company is also offering a grid-tied battery configuration that enables energy self-consumption and saving modes of operation without adding backup power for outages. This configuration minimizes system components used, focusing on reduced upfront costs and ease-of-installation.
Additionally, Enphase’s new power control system (PCS) software is designed to allow installers to build oversized solar and battery systems without triggering a main panel upgrade, potentially saving homeowners thousands of dollars and further improving the system payback time.
 
 
The update comes at a critical time when the California rooftop solar market is suffering as much as a 38% pullback in demand, according to Wood Mackenzie.
Enphase has an NEM 3.0 landing page for installers looking to improve their California rooftop solar sales pitch. A whitepaper goes into detail on how installers can maximize return on investment for their customers.
Enphase has shipped approximately 68 million microinverters, and more than 3.5 million Enphase-based systems have been deployed in over 145 countries.

UbiQD, Inc., a New Mexico-based nanotechnology company, entered into a joint development agreement with First Solar to further explore the benefits of incorporating fluorescent quantum dot technology in advanced solar modules.
“If successful, this application in solar modules could be a perfect example of the broad applicability of our core technology,” said Hunter McDaniel, UbiQD CEO. “With emerging applications in food and energy, these novel nanomaterials are proving to be a key tool in humanity’s urgent response to climate change and further sustainable economic development.”
Quantum dots (QD) are photoluminescent particles so small that it would take 100,000 of them to span one fingernail, said UbiQD. The company said it has applications in localized DC microgrids, smart building solutions, including integration with sensors for climate and ambient controls. UbiQD also has a UbiGro brand used in greenhouse and agrivoltaic installations.
“As we work towards developing the next generation of photovoltaics, we are exploring a range of enhancements that could allow us to convert more sunlight into energy,” said Markus Gloeckler, chief technology officer, First Solar. “We are interested in the potential use of quantum dots in optimizing the absorption of light and look forward to continuing our work with UbiQD on exploring this possibility.”
While UbiQD (short for Ubiquitous Quantum Dots) is a startup, it has much history in high-level applications. In 2021 UbiQD installed its energy-producing windows at three commercial sites. In 2022, the company’s quantum dot solar technology was used in a Small Business Innovation Research project with the United States Air Force. The Air force contract provided funding for two installations of over 20 windows and additional scale-up and development funds for the product. Also in 2022, UbiQD announced that it was developing a solution for controlled-environment agriculture in partnership with Heliene, a U.S.-based solar module manufacturer.
UbiQD also took part as a Growth Stage company earlier this year in the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 2023 NREL Industry Growth Forum. The forum included 40 companies that represent a range of clean and sustainable technology startups from around the world, and UbiQD was recognized as the Best Overall Venture.

From pv magazine Australia
Pacific Energy has delivered a hybrid power station incorporating a 6 MW solar array fitted with 11,088 PV panels, a 2.4 MW battery energy storage system, and a 9.5 MW gas-fuelled power plant at Westgold’s Tuckabianna mine site near Cue in Western Australia’s remote mid-west.
Jamie Cullen, chief executive officer of Perth-based Pacific Energy, said the new 17.9 MW Tuckabianna power plant replaces the existing diesel-fired power station and is the first of four new hybrid facilities being developed for Westgold.
“Tuckabianna is part of a larger project to consolidate six existing power stations into four high-efficiency hybrid power stations that incorporate gas, solar and battery storage systems,” he said.
“Collectively this represents one of the largest fully integrated hybrid power systems in the Australian mining sector.”
The other three power facilities at Westgold’s Bluebird, Fortnum, and Big Bell mining sites are scheduled to be installed and operational by the third quarter of 2024.
 
With a combined capacity of 82 MW, including nearly 30 MW of solar and 11.4 MW of battery storage, the new facilities are expected to collectively save 38 million litres of diesel per annum and lower annual carbon emissions by about 57,000 tonnes.
Westgold Managing Director Wayne Bramwell said the new power plants, which he expects will drive down operating costs, are at the heart of the company’s clean energy transition initiative.
“This new hybrid power facility at Tuckabianna incorporates renewable energy and is a great first step along this journey, with power generated from these facilities energising our mines and processing hubs for decades to come,” he said.
The solar farms, battery storage and gas-fired power stations will be owned and operated by Pacific Energy under an electricity purchase agreement. The gas will be provided by Clean Energy Fuels Australia (CEFA) under an supply agreement.
