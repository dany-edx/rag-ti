Solar and wind power have variability in their productive hours, as multi-day weather events can impact output. Therefore, multi-day storage that is cost-effective is important in grid reliability.
Boston startup Form Energy developed technology to address this need, revealing recently the chemistry behind their iron-air batteries. The company said its iron-air batteries can store renewables-sourced electricity for 100 hours at system costs competitive with conventional power plants. At full-scale production, Form Energy said the modules would deliver electricity at a tenth of the cost of lithium-ion batteries.
The iron-air battery is composed of cells filled with thousands of iron pellets that are exposed to air and create rust. The oxygen is then removed, reverting the rust to iron. Controlling this process allows the battery to be charged and discharged.
$200 million in Series D funding has been secured for the project, led by $25 million from ArcelorMittal’s XCarb innovation fund. ArcelorMittal will non-exclusively supply the iron materials for the battery system production, and Form Energy said it intends to source its iron domestically, manufacturing the batteries near where the iron was sourced.
The company’s first project is a 1 MW / 150 MWh pilot installation with Minnesota-based utility Great River Energy, located near the American Iron Range. Form Energy said it expects to have the facility deployed at a Great River Energy power plant by 2023.
Mateo Jaramillo, CEO and Co-founder of Form Energy, said, “We conducted a broad review of available technologies and have reinvented the iron-air battery to optimize it for multi-day energy storage for the electric grid. With this technology, we are tackling the biggest barrier to deep decarbonization: making renewable energy available when and where it’s needed, even during multiple days of extreme weather or grid outages.”

Interested developers can apply for photovoltaic power plants with an installed capacity of 10 MW, 5 MW, 2 MW and 1 MW, respectively, and will have time until October 5 to submit their bids.
The auction's winners will be granted a 15-year power purchase agreement and will be paid a feed-in premium tariff on top of the electricity price. The ministry did not provide details on the total capacity it expects to allocate.
Other solar tenders were previously held in the country by the state-owned electric company Elektrani na Severna Makedonija (ESM).
Furthermore, Bulgaria-based solar developer Solarpro Holding won in April a tender to build a 50 MW solar power plant at the former Oslomej coal power plant near Kicevo, North Macedonia. The developer secured the rights to develop, fund, build, operate and maintain the PV power plant, but without a fixed tariff or feed-in premium.
According to the latest figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Balkan country had around 94 MW of cumulative installed PV capacity by the end of 2020. Thermal power plants account for 842 MW of North Macedonia’s total power generation capacity of 1.41 GW, with hydroelectricity and wind accounting for 553.6 MW and 36.8 MW, respectively. The government has said it aims to close coal-fired thermal plants by 2030.

Many commercial projects featuring different types of flow batteries are already underway for both large-scale and residential energy storage. However, questions are being raised about the materials used in some of the batteries, with the toxicity of vanadium used in most of the large-scale projects a particular sticking point.
Zinc-based flow batteries present a less toxic option, and a zinc-bromine chemistry has already seen some commercial development. Zinc-iron (Zn-Fe) is another option widely explored by researchers, with the abundance of iron making it a particularly attractive option. However, dendrite growth and the related performance loss and short-circuiting, have held this chemistry back so far.
Scientists led by the University of Calicut in India fabricated a zinc-iron redox flow battery that demonstrated discharge voltage of approximately 1.34 V at 25 mA cm−2, with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 92%, voltage efficiency (VE) of 85% and energy efficiency (EE) of ~78% for 30 charge-discharge cycles. Most importantly, the battery showed no performance degradation over those initial 30 cycles, and zero dendrite growth. The battery is described in full in the paper A dendrite free Zn-Fe hybrid redox flow battery for renewable energy storage, published in Energy Storage.
Though it would have to retain these characteristics for a lot more than 30 cycles, the results are encouraging. The group credits the suppression of dendrites to its use of an anion-exchange membrane (AEM) that it designed and fabricated using guanidine carbonate, formaldehyde, melamine and polymer binding agent.
They note that when this was replaced with a porous PVC membrane as a control experiment dendrite formation could be observed even on the battery’s first charge. “Absence of dendrite growth might be due to the fact that, only the chloride ions shuttles between two electrolyte solutions through AEM and this probably promotes uniform zinc deposition and prevents the dendrite growth,” the group states.
They expect to follow up with further details on the fabrication of the AEM and its role in the battery’s performance, and the group remains convinced that its approach can prove useful for the stationary storage of renewable energy, among other applications. “We have successfully demonstrated working of a high efficiency and stable Zn-Fe hybrid redox flow battery with no dendrite growth during zinc deposition by optimizing charge-discharge conditions and employing an anion exchange membrane as separator,” their paper concludes.

Construction on the plant has now started and its completion is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2022. Once finalized, the project should become the country's and Southeast Asia's largest floating PV plant.
According to the report Indonesia Energy Transition Outlook 2021, which was recently published by the Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR), the facility will sell power at a tariff of $0.0581/kWh. The report also revealed that PT Indonesia Power tendered, last year, two floating PV projects with capacities of 60 MW and 90 MW, respectively, and final prices came in at $0.0374/kWh and $0.0368/kWh, respectively.
Indonesia, with more than 17,000 islands and 100 reservoirs – plus 521 natural lakes – is planning a further 60 floating PV installations as it chases a target of having 23% of its power generated by renewables by 2025, and 31% by 2030.
Last month, Singaporean solar developer Sunseap has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Batam Indonesia Free Zone Authority (BP Batam) – which is the public authority responsible for the management, development, and construction on the island of Batam in Indonesia – for the construction of a 2.2 GW PV floating project at the Duriangkang Reservoir in the southern part of the region.

The Australian Energy Council’s (AEC) latest Quarterly Solar Report reveals that more than 14.7 GW of solar PV has been installed on Australian rooftops, making rooftop solar the second largest generator by capacity in Australia.
The AEC’s Quarterly Solar Report shows while coal-fired generation has more capacity, rooftop solar is continuing to expand with 109,000 systems installed in the second quarter this year.
The AEC said analysis of the latest data from the Clean Energy Regulator shows that at the end of June more than 2.86 million solar systems had been installed on Australian rooftops, delivering a total installed capacity of more than 14.7 GW, ensuring rooftop solar continues to eat into the market share once firmly held by fossil fuel-powered generators.
AEC chief executive Sarah McNamara said the average installed capacity of rooftop solar has steadily increased and continues to defy expectations.
“While the 2020-21 financial year was difficult for most industries due to the impact of COVID-19, Australia’s rooftop solar PV industry does not appear to have been overly affected, based on this AEC analysis,” she said.
“All jurisdictions, except the Northern Territory, hit records for the number of solar panels installed compared to the previous financial year.”
The AEC said that during the 2020-21 financial year, an estimated 373,000 solar systems were installed on Australian homes, up from 323,500 during 2019-20. Installed capacity also jumped from 2.5 GW to more than 3 GW while the average unit size reached 8.06 kW in June.
New South Wales led the way with more than 116,000 rooftop systems installed and 965 MW of capacity added to household rooftops during the 2020-21 financial year.
Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia also saw strong uptake, with a total of 212,000 installations and a combined capacity of 1.67 GW.
McNamara said continued low technology costs, increased working from home arrangements, and a shift in household spending to home improvements during the COVID-19 pandemic played a key role in the increased rollout of rooftop solar PV systems.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/05/novel-plant-design-for-agrivoltaics/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 5, 2021",Novel plant design for agrivoltaics,"A group of researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China has developed a special design for agrivoltaic projects that, compared to other approaches, is claimed to reduce the shading effect of the PV installation and improve crops’ light environment and the crop growth process, yield and quality.
“The system has a cost that is 10% higher than conventional agrivoltaic project, but the improved crop yield ensured by the optimized lighting management would compensate for this slightly higher investment,” research co-author, Jan Ingenhoff, told pv magazine.
In terms of economic feasibility, a system developed with the proposed approach should be built at a cost of approximately €715 per kW installed and a yearly cost for maintenance of about €6.5 per kW.
Called Even-lighting Agrivoltaic System (EAS), the novel design methodology consists of utilizing metal brackets as mounting structures, conventional solar panels, and a grooved glass plate placed between the solar panels. The latter occupies an area that is one-third of the light-receiving area of the entire system. “With the installation of the glass plate, the density of PV panel arrays is the same as conventional photovoltaic power stations and very close to the optimum design for energy production,” the scientists affirmed.
According to Ingenhoff, any regular glass with a high transmission coefficient can be used, as there are no special requirements, and silicate glass and ultra-white glass may be perfectly suitable.
The metal brackets are placed on columns that are high enough to allow the growth of tall plants and the use of big agricultural machinery. The optimum tilt angle for modules was determined at 23 degrees, which the research group described as a good compromise between electricity generation and construction costs.
The scientists initially calculated and simulated optically the design of the grooved glass plate and then built a first pilot 35 kW agrivoltaic project in Fuyang city, in China's Anhui province. Common vegetables such as lettuce, broccoli, garlic sprouts, garlic, rapeseed, Jerusalem artichoke, among others, were then planted.
A second pilot system was deployed more recently in Hefei city, in the same Chinese province.

The EAS system provided improved growing conditions for some plants. For example, the Jerusalem artichoke harvest increased by over 20%. The reason behind this may be due to better soil moisture retained within the facility area, or that the plant can remain under photosynthesis between 11:00 and 2:00 pm in good sun radiation days, which is typically entering a dormant state for the plant outside, as leaf photosynthesis reaches a maximum in the late morning.
For both facilities, the height at which the solar panels were placed was 2.5 meters. Some of the plants also grew under the system equipped with supplementary LED lamps powered by the solar panels, which provided plants an extra 2 h light time every day compared to other treatments.
“The comprehensive economic benefits of EAS consist of the installation and maintenance costs, the electricity generation benefits and the crops harvest benefits,” the academics explained. “To accurately evaluate the comprehensive benefits of planting different crops, we considered the time required to plant different crops and the amount of electricity generated by the PV panels during the crop growth.”
According to their measurements, the use of the transparent grooved glass plate improved the irradiation collected by crops in one day by 47.38% compared to a conventional system, and the yield of Jerusalem artichoke, which needs at least six hours of sun a day, improved by 23%.

Including solar power generation, the system has shown that a farmer’s average income increases by 5.14 times and performed a high land equivalent ratio (LER), which is the measure the productivity and effectiveness of intercropping. It also improved the economic benefits on the farmland per hectare.
“Under the EAS, crops grew fast, and the yield was similar or better than that under the natural state,” the Chinese group noted. “By adding supplementary LED lamps into the EAS, the soluble sugar content of lettuce increased by 72.14% and the nitrate content of lettuce decreased by 21.51%.”
More details on the system design can be found in the paper Increasing the comprehensive economic benefits of farmland with Even-lighting Agrivoltaic Systems, published in Plos One.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/05/sandia-researchers-develop-new-grid-scale-energy-storage-battery/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 5, 2021",Sandia researchers develop new grid-scale energy storage battery,"From pv magazine USA
Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories have designed a new class of molten sodium batteries for grid-scale energy storage.
Molten sodium batteries store energy from renewable sources. However, commercially available versions, called sodium-sulfur batteries, typically operate at 520-660 degrees Fahrenheit. Sandia’s new molten sodium-iodide battery operates at 230 degrees Fahrenheit instead.
Researchers said that “a whole cascading cost savings” comes along with lowering the battery temperature. For example, less expensive materials may be used, the batteries need less insulation, and the wiring that connects the batteries can be thinner.
But battery chemistry that works at 550 degrees doesn’t work at 230 degrees. Among the innovations that allowed this lower operating temperature was development of a catholyte, a liquid mixture of two salts; in this case, sodium iodide and gallium chloride.
A basic lead-acid battery, commonly used as a car ignition battery, has a lead plate and a lead dioxide plate with a sulfuric acid electrolyte in the middle. As energy is discharged from the battery, the lead plate reacts with sulfuric acid to form lead sulfate and electrons. These electrons start the car and return to the other side of the battery, where the lead dioxide plate uses the electrons and sulfuric acid to form lead sulfate and water.
For the new molten sodium battery, the lead plate is replaced by liquid sodium metal, and the lead dioxide plate is replaced by a liquid mixture of sodium iodide and a small amount of gallium chloride.
When energy is discharged from the new battery, the sodium metal produces sodium ions and electrons. On the other side, the electrons turn iodine into iodide ions. The sodium ions move across a separator to the other side where they react with the iodide ions to form molten sodium iodide salt.
Instead of a sulfuric acid electrolyte, the middle of the battery is a special ceramic separator that allows only sodium ions to move from side to side.
Unlike a lithium ion battery, everything is liquid on the two sides, the researchers said. That eliminates issues like the material undergoing complex phase changes or falling apart. And that means the liquid-based batteries don’t have as limited a lifetime as many other batteries.
Additionally, at 3.6V, the new sodium-iodide battery has a 40% higher operating voltage than a commercial molten sodium battery, the researchers said. This voltage leads to higher energy density, meaning that potential future batteries made with this chemistry would need fewer cells, fewer connections between cells, and an overall lower unit cost to store the same amount of electricity.
The next step for the sodium-iodide battery project is to continue to tune and refine the catholyte chemistry to replace the gallium chloride component, Small said. Gallium chloride is expensive, more than 100 times as expensive as table salt.
The team is also working on engineering tweaks to get the battery to charge and discharge faster and more fully. One previously identified modification to speed up the battery charging was to coat the molten sodium side of the ceramic separator with a thin layer of tin.
The researchers said it would likely take five to 10 years to get sodium-iodide batteries to market, with most of the remaining challenges being commercialization challenges, rather than technical challenges.
The development of the new sodium battery was supported by the Department of Energy’s Office of Electricity Energy Storage Program.
