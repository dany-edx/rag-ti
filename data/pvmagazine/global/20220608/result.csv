Germany's heating solutions provider Thermondo and South Korean company LG Electronics began jointly offering heat pump leasing to their German clients since in June.
Homeowners are asked to pay a fixed monthly price of €159 ($170.6) without the need for high initial investment. The offer is valid nationwide and includes the “Thermondo easy” leasing model, which is an all-round service that includes two-year maintenance and remote diagnostics in the event of faults. In addition, Thermondo manages all funding and financing processes, as well as the disposal of the old heating system.
Thermondo wants to encourage the owners of existing buildings to make the switch. According to the company, the use of heat pumps in 6 million of the approximately 20 million existing buildings would be technically feasible in Germany.
Thermondo wants to install almost 10,000 heat pumps in this market segment by the end of 2023. A digitally supported planning process makes it possible to calculate the heating load per room in order to determine the optimal heat pump solution.
The households that decide to make the switch will receive a heat pump from LG Electronics. “The LG Therma V Monobloc S is a particularly quiet air/water heat pump with high energy efficiency (A+++) and full heat output at low ambient temperatures,” the company said in a statement.
A large partner like LG Electronics is important, especially with a view to scaling, but also with a view to converting the heating systems in existing buildings. “The LG Therma V heat pump is quiet, powerful and energy-efficient and, with a flow temperature of more than 60 C, is ideal for existing buildings,” said Lucas Koczian, head of Thermondo's product portfolio.
According to the German federal government, 6 million heat pumps are to be installed in Germany by 2030. According to the “Energy Efficiency Work Plan” of the Federal Ministry of Economics, the aim is to increase the number of newly installed heat pumps to over 500,000 units per year by 2024.
LG Electronics launched its Home Energy Package in Germany in March 2021. The hybrid system combines a heat pump, a PV system, and battery storage to provide residential buildings and small businesses with heat and electricity.

The developer issued a press release stating it had sold its South African operation to Johannesburg-based pan-African peer BTE Renewables, which is backed by London financier Actis.
Sonnedix did not reveal the value of the transaction nor details of any solar plants transferred other than the 75 MW-contracted capacity Mulilo Sonnedix Prieska field, which was the subject of an investigation by pv magazine and Green Building Africa in February 2020.
Quoted in the press release, Sonnedix CEO Axel Thielmann said: “We are moving our operations away from South Africa – where we’ve been successfully managing our 86.2 MW Sonnedix Prieska project for over five years – in order to align our sustainable growth strategy across OECD markets.”
Sonnedix' website indicates the company had a 6.4 GW solar portfolio at the start of June, described as 1.8 GW of operational solar capacity; 400 MW under construction; and a development pipeline of 4.1 GW. It is not clear what the missing 100 MW relates to.
A list of Sonnedix projects on the site includes facilities, listed here in order of scale, in the OECD nations of Italy, Spain, Chile, Poland, Japan, France, the US, the UK, and Germany.
pv magazine‘s investigation revealed remediation work was under way at the Mulilo Sonnedix Prieska field in February 2020, after reports of backsheet failures.
The ZAR 1.3 billion ($84.3 million) solar farm was supplied with 315 Wp panels from Chinese manufacturer BYD. South African solar manufacturer Artsolar also supplied BYD-branded products to the project.
German company Juwi was responsible for operations and maintenance of the site, located in Copperton, in the Northern Cape province.
BTE Renewables chief executive Robert Skjodt, quoted in the Sonnedix press release, said his company already owned two solar projects “in the same area of South Africa,” and that the acquisition would expand BTE's clean power portfolio to 473 MW.

According to him, around 0.64 GW of new renewable energy projects were already connected to the grid in the first four months of the year and another 0.68 GW should be switched on soon in the country's high voltage network operated by Terna. Furthermore, another 3.8 GW of installations were recently approved and should come online by the end of the year.
The Italian government expects PV to represent around 3.37 GW of the predicted new renewable energy capacity, of which 2.8 GW should be deployed on the low and middle voltage network. Moreover, it said that another 2.1 GW of authorized renewable energy projects may come online in 2023 and another 1.1 GW in 2024. “This would bring to 8 GW the authorized capacity since the government launched its action to accelerate renewables,” the ministry said, referring to the measures it announced this year to streamline clean energy development.
For example, the new VIA Fast Track committee it established in January has so far granted favorable approval to 103 projects, with only 17 facilities being rejected.
Italy deployed 937 MW of new PV systems in 2021 and its cumulative installed solar power reached 22.56 GW at the end of December. Italy's National Integrated Plan for Climate and Energy is aiming for 50 GW of solar by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/08/solar-module-cleaning-is-just-the-beginning/,"SPONSORED,WORLD",,"JUNE 8, 2022",Module cleaning is just the beginning,"Over the past six months, Portugal- based ChemiTek has tested a number of antistatic and hydrophobic coatings designed for solar modules. The coatings were tested at the “Green Energy Park” in Rabat, Morocco, and the results point to a bright future in their adoption.
However, the results also demonstrate that the coatings are most effective when tailored to environmental and climactic conditions. To meet this need, ChemiTek studies the different conditions of each solar park, down to the amount and type of dirt, the location of the panels and the weather, along with the cleaning method, all to ensure the solution meets the specific project’s needs.
Studies show that dirty panels can result in energy losses of up to 50%. ChemiTek has developed a range of agents to remove contaminants and harsh soiling, such as lichen, cement dust, gypsum, hard water, bird droppings, pollen, beeswax, and others.
For example, if a solar plant is affected by cement dust, stone dust, gypsum, and other alkaline contaminants, ChemiTek’s Cement Removal Agent (CRA) will react chemically with these contaminants, removing them in a highly effective way. 
Another problem that affects the production of energy from PV modules, and that can even damage the system, is the appearance of lichens, mosses, and other fungi on their surface, especially in very humid environments and in sites with large amounts of organic matter – near forests, agricultural plantations and so on. For this, ChemiTek has developed its Lichen Removal Agent (LRA). 
For the removal of organic dirt, such as pollen and bees’ wax, bird droppings, sand, dust, and resin, it is recommended to use the cleaning and protection solution Solar Wash Protect (SWP). SWP is not only highly effective in removing accumulated dirt, it also results in an antistatic coating that repels dust and prevents the adhesion of soiling. 
It is important to use the correct type of water in module cleaning, in order not to leave water stains on the module. Hard water – containing high levels of minerals and metal ions – can result in stains and deposits, which will block light transmission and can even lead to the creation of hotspots on the module. To solve this, ChemiTek has developed the Water Softening Agent (WSA), a biodegradable agent that captures minerals and metal ions, making the water completely safe to use for PV cleaning.
ChemiTek has several coatings that can be applied during or after cleaning and tested by TÜV Sud. Including antistatic coatings for dry and moderate climates and hydrophobic coatings for rainy environments.
SWP and Antistatic Solar Armor (ASA) are antistatic coatings. SWP and Antistatic Solar Armor (ASA) are antistatic coatings. SWP is a cleaning and protection product designed for manual cleaning and/or plants with heavy soiling. ASA, meanwhile, is an antistatic coating applied by professionals on solar plants in dryer climates, preferably used with semiautomatic equipment (for example, brush on a tractor and/or robot).
For locations with very humid and rainy weather, it is recommended the use of hydrophobic coatings, such as the D-Solar Defendor (DSD), which is for professional use and to be applied at high dilutions with brush on tractors or robots; and the Industrial Glass Protect (IGP) – an easy to apply, long-lasting (+5 years) coating that provides high hydrophobicity and is very resistant to adverse environmental conditions such as acid rain, high salinity, and extreme temperatures. The application of IGP can also lead to a reduction in the amount of cleaning required.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/08/novel-stack-design-for-pem-electrolyzers-promises-lower-production-costs/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 8, 2022",Novel stack design for PEM electrolyzers promises lower production costs,"A group of researchers from Germany has proposed to replace titanium (Ti) bipolar plates (BPPs) in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers with plates based on coated stainless steel (ss) in an effort to reduce current high manufacturing costs. “PEM electrolyzers currently use costly materials, such as titanium and platinum group metals (PGM), due to the harsh oxidative conditions within the cells,” the scientists emphasized, noting that BPPs account for up to 60% of the stack costs.
They used plates with a circular shape and an active area of 86 cm2 provided by Norwegian hydrogen specialist Nel Hydrogen and coated them with stainless steel and niobium (Nb) through vacuum plasma spraying (VPS). “Before starting the spraying procedure, the substrates were sand-blasted with silicon dioxide (SiO2) powder to increase surface roughness as well as adhesion of the coating powders and preheated to 250 C in the vacuum chamber,” they explained. “The Nb layers were deposited by applying a power of 1.0 kW for 15 min, so that a layer thickness of 1.4 μm was achieved, which was sealed using the aforementioned capillary sealing process.”
The stack was assembled in a four-cell configuration with different anode BPP and it was operated in a test stand that is used for standard PEM electrolyzers. During the 14,000 h test, the cells with coated ss-BPP exhibited performance of around 1.9 V at 1 A cm−2, which the scientists described as similar to that of a commercial baseline cell. “The test protocol did not include any previously planned shutdown periods, yet these events occurred triggered by common test stations issues and common challenges found when operating test-rigs for such a long time,” they specified.

The performance of the Nb/ss-BPP plate was compared to that of an identical plate integrating Ti and both coatings showed no sign of corrosion and were able to fully protect the substrate during operation. According to the scientists, both plates performed comparably to the baseline material from Nel Hydrogen and their performance reached a cell efficiency of nearly 78%, with a degradation rate of only 1.2%. “However, from a cost perspective, the Nb coating offers a clear advantage over Nb/Ti, as it requires two processing steps to apply and form a thick and stable oxide layer,” they stressed.
The scientists described the stack design in the paper “Long-Term Operation of Nb-Coated Stainless Steel Bipolar Plates for Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers,” published in Advanced Energy and Sustainability Research. “The results achieved can mark a turning point for future electrolysis research, in which steel-based stack components are seen as the new standard, laying the foundation for the massive cost reduction in PEM electrolyzers and thus an essential factor for the production of competitive green hydrogen.”
The research group comprises academics from the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the University of Applied Sciences Esslingen, the Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH research center, and Nel Hydrogen itself.

China-based solar tracking and mounting solutions provider Arctech has announced that its first manufacturing joint venture in India, Jash Energy, has entered into trial operation. The 3 GW solar tracker factory is located over 16 acres in Mundra, Gujarat.
The factory is equipped with fully automatic production lines to produce all major components for the company’s solar tracker products, including posts, torque tubes, purlins, and fasteners. 
“By applying the fully automatic production lines, we can stay agile and make fast adjustments to the current supply strategy, increase productivity, stay competitive, and prepare for the future — including for unprecedented events, such as a pandemic. It also helps accelerate the adoption of India’s Industry 4.0 solutions,” said Gail Chen, Arctech general manager for East Asia and India and Jash Energy CEO.

Arctech said its India factory would serve as part of the company’s effort to ease the pressure of the global supply chain disruption intensified in the first half of 2022 with Covid-19 in mainland China as well as logistics and raw material challenges.
Strategically located in Mundra, the largest private port in India, Jash Energy will have easy access to Western, Middle East, and African markets. Mundra also provides an ideal base for traders due to its relatively short logistics connectivity to the northwestern hinterland. It is easily accessible from all major industrial destinations in Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh for the export of cargo, the company stated.
Arctech has added more than 200 jobs to the local community by setting up this factory. It also plans technical training for local employees. 
As for raw materials availability, the company is planning to go deeper in vertically integrated production, including using local steel for trackers that are made in India. It plans to work with domestic steel manufacturing partners to develop solar trackers.

“The model specification was recently approved by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), a non-profit corporation that assures reliable electricity in 14 western US states, two Canadian provinces, and northern Baja, Mexico,” the research group stated. “The approval means that the model is available to be integrated into commercially available grid simulation tools used by thousands of utilities in North America and other parts of the world.”
The researchers said their work built on previous work demonstrating that grid-forming inverters can operate microgrids without conventional synchronous power generators. “The outcomes of microgrid research suggested that grid-forming inverters can ensure system stability for integrating renewable energy sources into future power grids,” they emphasized.
In their recent work, published on the WECC website, the PNNL scientists described the inverter main circuit representation, the droop control, and the fault current limiting function. “This model applies to energy storage systems and photovoltaic (PV) systems,” they specified.
“Our preliminary simulation studies based on the model show that grid-forming inverters can impact power system stability in a very positive way,” said Song Wang, president of the WECC Modeling and Validation Subcommittee. “We believe the work done by PNNL will greatly help the utility industry better understand grid-forming inverters and their potential impacts on power systems.”
Looking forward, the US group said it wanted to create an ecosystem for grid-forming inverters and unify different models for grid-forming technologies and their diverse applications.

“Eleven generation facilities will be generating electricity for their own use, and five generation facilities will be generating electricity for commercial purposes,” the regulator said in a statement. “All applicants have connection approvals from licensed distributors.”
Eleven plants are expected to be connected to the grid of national utility Eskom and the other four projects will be linked to municipal networks. The project size ranges from 0.1 MW to 80 MW.
All applications were submitted to Nersa in April and the regulator claims it processed them within the 19-day deadline. “Since the increase of the registration threshold from 1 MW to 100 MW, Nersa has approved 218 registration applications. In the first quarter of 2022, 54 generation facilities with a total capacity of 29.1 MW were approved,” it stated.
In late May, Cape Town-based renewables developer Sola Group secured approval from Nersa to build two 100 MW solar power plants under the new rules.
The South African government raised the threshold for the distributed-generation solar segment to 100 MW in August 2021, exempting developers from applying for generation licenses to improve the entire permitting process. The new rules also imposed a wheeling fee to be paid to national state-owned utility Eskom for the maintenance and upkeep of its infrastructure to transport the energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/08/enphase-claims-new-safety-regulations-mean-more-australian-installers-prefer-its-iq-microinverters/,"INVERTERS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"JUNE 8, 2022",Enphase claims new safety regulations mean more Australian installers prefer its IQ Microinverters,"From pv magazine Australia
US-based microinverter manufacturer Enphase Energy claims a growing number of Australian solar installers are now exclusively offering Enphase products after increased solar safety regulations and compliance standards came into effect in May. 
AS/NSS5033:2021 is an update to installation and safety requirements for PV arrays that came into effect across Australia in May 2022. The tightened regulations introduce new compliance measures for DC string-inverter-based solar systems, including restrictive cable runs, IEC 62930 compliant DC cables and warning signs for DC voltage. 
However, Enphase claims that its microinverters, which operate as AC decentralized inverter-based systems at extra-low voltage, are exempt from most new regulations. The company claims this exemption is prompting “some Australian solar installers” to “exclusively” push Enphase technology. 
One such installer, John Inglis, founder of Positronic Solar, said his company is “well known in the industry for testing solar system components to destruction before we include them in our designs, which is an important factor in our decision to drop DC string solar systems and exclusively offer Enphase technology.” 
“Our extensive experience witnessing the advantages Enphase systems offer our customers makes its microinverters a fundamental part of our uncompromising commitment to solar quality and safety,” Inglis said.
Aleksandar Arnautovic, director at Sydney Air and Solar, seconded Inglis. “Because each solar panel is fitted with its own inverter and there is never any high-voltage DC electricity in the system, Enphase microinverters provide AC reliability and safety as well as panel-level smarts,” said Arnautovic. “We chose to go 100% Enphase to offer both our residential and commercial customers a solar solution that would deliver long-term benefits, flexibility, and return-on-investment.” 
Similarly, Evo Solar’s Cameron Pike said “the rapid changes in Australia’s solar standards to address lagging safety issues have been negated by the intelligent design of the Enphase energy platform, and this gives us 100% confidence in the products we sell and the future-proofing benefits our customers receive.” 
Enphase says that its IQ Microinverters go through more than one million cumulative hours of power-on testing (in aggregate), to ensure the product is undaunted by heat, high humidity, salty air, extreme cold or harsh conditions. Enphase offers a 10-year warranty which can be extended up to 25 years with an additional fee. 
Enphase Energy’s chief commercial officer Dave Ranhoff, said, “given the huge role solar power plays in building a clean energy future, any compromises on electrical safety and component quality are the antithesis of sustainability.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/08/after-a-suppressed-first-quarter-the-us-solar-market-is-buoyed-by-tariff-suspension/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 8, 2022","After a suppressed first quarter, the US solar market is buoyed by tariff suspension","From pv magazine USA
The US solar industry had its lowest quarter of installations since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the US Solar Market Insight report released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie. In Q1 2022, price increases and supply chain constraints continued to suppress the solar market as the industry installed 24% less solar capacity than Q1 2021.

However, the tide turned yesterday when the Biden administration announced a 24-month tariff exemption on solar modules manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Without this action, massive project delays and cancellations would have continued throughout 2022, putting President Biden’s climate goals at risk.

Since the Department of Commerce (DOC) announced in March that it would act on a petition filed by Auxin Solar and launch an antidumping investigation into Chinese companies working in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, solar module manufacturers halted shipments to the United States, causing an industry-wide module shortage. According to the US Solar Market Insight Q1 report, these supply constraints are expected to ease as manufacturers ramp up shipments to the United States in the coming months.
“The solar industry is facing multiple challenges that are slowing America’s clean energy progress, but this week’s action from the Biden administration provides a jolt of certainty businesses need to keep projects moving and create jobs,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO. “President Biden has clearly taken notice of how drags on the industry are hampering grid resiliency. By acting decisively, this administration is breathing new life into the clean energy sector, while positioning the US to be a global solar manufacturing leader.”

The effects of the DOC investigation was taking its toll on what was previously a burgeoning industry, with 2022 forecasts cut in half due to continued supply chain challenges and the anti-circumvention inquiry.
“The White House’s executive action brings relief to the US solar industry, which has been steeped in uncertainty regarding the anti-circumvention investigation initiated by the Department of Commerce in late March following a petition filed by Auxin Solar, a domestic module manufacturer,” said Michelle Davis, Wood Mackenzie’s principal analyst.

“Despite this, this announcement is expected to create approximately 2 – 3 GW of upside potential to Wood Mackenzie’s 2022 base case outlook, assuming the global market resumes normal operations” Davis added.

Nearly all areas of the industry had been hit, but the greatest pain was felt in the utility-scale sector.  Utility-scale solar set an annual installation record in 2021 at nearly 17 GWdc; however, final installations in 2021 were lower than expected due to the many challenges faced in the industry. US solar suffered its sharpest decline in Q1 2022 and experienced its lowest quarter of installations since 2019. Multiple gigawatts of projects pushed their online dates from 2021 to 2022 or later. It also had the lowest number of new projects added to the pipeline since 2017.

The commercial solar market saw 28% quarter-over-quarter declines, while the community solar market shrank by 59% quarter-over-quarter. Project delays from interconnection challenges and supply chain constraints limited growth in both sectors.
The bright spot in the US solar industry was the residential sector, where installations totaled 4.2 GWdc in 2021, setting an annual record and exceeding more than 500,000 projects installed in a year for the first time.
Residential solar has a bright future, as well. Wood Mackenzie forecasts 13% growth for residential solar in 2022, although analysts note that NEM 3.0 in California and the expiration of the ITC heavily impact the base case outlook from 2023 onward. California volumes are set to fall by 45% in the first full year of NEM 3.0, and Wood Mac forecasts a 2% market contraction in 2023. The market will grow everywhere but California by 18% during the same time period. An ITC extension would paint an even rosier picture, with residential increasing to 13 GWdc, or 21%, from 2023 to 2032.
The 24-month tariff extension offers some certainty at a time when it is needed most, and it buys some time for industrial clean energy policies like long-term tax credits and manufacturing incentives to be put into place. Certainty around the investment tax credit (ITC) would be a major catalyst for the industry, increasing capacity installations over the next decade by 66%, according to the Q1 Insight report.

A 66% overall increase represents a 20% increase for residential, 15% for non-residential (commercial and community solar), and 86% for utility solar. Total installed solar in the United States under this scenario by 2032 would be nearly 700 GWdc compared to 464 GWdc in the base case.
For this Year in Review report, Wood Mackenzie released 10-year outlooks for each segment. Overall the solar industry is expected to more than triple from 120 GWdc installed today to 464 GWdc by 2032. While this is good news, it is far short of what’s needed to hit the Biden administration’s clean energy targets.
The Build Back Better (BBB) Act is unlikely to pass; however, there are opportunities for numerous clean energy provisions included in the BBB Act to make it to final legislation. The Wood Mac/SEIA report concludes that passage of an Investment Tax Credit (ITC) extension and other clean energy provisions would be a significant solar market catalyst, increasing installations by 66% in the next decade over the base case.

Briggs & Stratton, which acquired California battery maker SimpliPHI Power late in 2021, announced the launch of the SimpliPHI Energy Storage System (ESS), with the product available for orders beginning June 14. The integrated, scalable solution starts with three core components, a 6 kW inverter, 4.9 kWh battery, and a proprietary monitoring system. The system will be on display at the RE+ conference in Anaheim this September.
The battery uses lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) chemistry, which is known for its advantage of having a minimized fire risk when compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. It negates the use of cobalt, a metal associated with health hazards, and a key culprit in battery fires.
“Our energy storage solutions are held to industry-leading standards. From the chemistry, form factor and manufacturing processes of the batteries to the testing and validation requirements on behalf of our customers, we seek to provide a safer and more reliable solution,” said Catherine Von Burg, president and CEO at SimpliPHI Power.
The 6 kW inverter has integrated multiple power point tracking for solar or utility charging in either DC-coupled or retrofit AC coupled systems. The inverter’s eight-millisecond switchover time prevents flickering lights and equipment damage associated with power outages. It is optimized for the LFP battery, and scalable in 6 kW increments.
The battery contains a closed-loop communications system in its battery management system, which logically integrates with the inverter and proprietary EnergyTrak management software. It is scalable from one module to 72, for a total energy storage capacity of up to 358.5 kWh. The battery and inverter are both IP65 rated for both indoor and outdoor use.
The monitoring system allows users to manage energy usage through a mobile app that provides real-time status and updates. The system enables performance optimization, boosts utility bill savings, and creates energy security for customers.
“With aging power grids, more frequent outages and unpredictable weather patterns, the addition of the SimpliPHI ESS to our product lineup is another solution for people looking for an innovative, scalable energy system for their home or business,” said Tom Rugg, president, Energy Solutions at Briggs & Stratton.
SimpliPHI batteries are backed with over 110 years of power experience, with batteries deployed in over 40 countries. The equipment comes with six to ten-year limited warranties. The batteries are capable of integration with solar arrays, the power grid, and backup generators.
