With the EU gunning for a tenfold increase in European electrolyzer manufacturing capacity within three and a half years, the commission last week pledged to soon adopt a recommendation and legislative proposal to accelerate permitting for clean energy projects.
A joint declaration issued by the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance reiterated the estimate that 500 TWh of clean electricity would be needed to produce 10 million tons of green hydrogen annually by the end of the decade. That figure was the ambition announced by the EU in March, when it responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine by redoubling its energy security aims under a “RePower EU” initiative. The policy drive included a goal of doubling domestically produced clean hydrogen, while scaling up imports to a further 10 million tons per year by 2030.
EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton and the chiefs of 20 European manufacturers met at a European electrolyzer summit last week and promised to work together to scale up the bloc's annual electrolyzer production capacity tenfold from its current 1.75 GW by 2025. That 1.75 GW figure is based on the volume of hydrogen the electrolyzers could produce; when measured by the amount of clean electricity needed to power the equipment, the figure is around 2.5 GW.
Clean power requirement
It has been estimated the production of 10 million tons per year of clean hydrogen would require 90-100/140 GW of electrolyzer capacity in 2030.
With industry representatives identifying a lack of supportive legislation, of large-scale finance, and of equipment components and raw materials as the chief hurdles to overcome, the commission committed to help address those concerns. The bloc promised to prioritize assessment of hydrogen projects when it is notified by EU member states of proposals to give state aid and said it would aim to decide the merits of the first hydrogen-related important projects of common European interest (IPCEIs) within six weeks of submission, with a view to completing assessment of the initial IPCEIs “by summer.”
The EU also pledged to drive forward proposals for carbon contracts for difference (CCFDs). The contracts would fix an auction-determined level of income for companies which produce carbon allowance certificates which would be linked to the market-driven price of the certificates on the European emissions trading scheme (ETS). Instead of being subject to fluctuation in the carbon price, certificate producers – in this case, electrolyzer makers – would receive a publicly funded top up to the value of their certificates when the ETS-determined price is below the CCFD figure. When the ETS carbon price is higher than the CCFD strike price, the certificate holders would refund the difference back to the appropriate public fund.
The bloc also offered the financial support of its lender, the European Investment Bank, which it said has already financed €550 million ($580 million) of hydrogen projects and is currently assessing the merits of more than €1 billion of further project credit lines.
In return, electrolyzer manufacturers said they would put forward “only … high-quality project proposals,” and would work to reduce the raw material requirements of the technology, as well as improving the use of recycled materials.
Both parties to the agreement also pledged to devote funds to the research and development effort, which could be expected to drive down electrolyzer costs.

Inficold, a provider of cold chain solutions for off-grid solar applications, has developed multi-chamber, modular solar cold storage systems to address the problem of food spoilage caused by India’s inefficient cold-chain network. 
Large cold storage is difficult to find in large cities, and farm/village level cold storage is primarily non-existent due to unreliable grid electricity. Inficold’s system enables farm-level cooling for perishable commodities in locations with weak grid availability.
The Inficold solar cold storage system stores solar energy in a thermal storage system (TSS) for cooling during non-solar hours. The system automatically switches to grid electricity if TSS depletes below a minimum level. The end user can configure these systems in the temperature range of 0 C to 20 C. 
The solar-powered cold storage is available in both container and indoor cold room options, in capacities ranging from 5 metric tons (MT) to 100 MT. This technology is modular in that multiple thermal energy storage can be integrated into larger cold storage. 
The 10 MT model is powered by 14 kWp of solar panels. The system comes with four chamber options, providing the flexibility to store multiple commodities in different temperature-controlled chambers. Pre-cooling capacity on solar (removing field heat from freshly harvested produce) is 2,500 kg/day. Pre-cooling capacity on solar plus grid is 5,000 kg/day.
Inficold developed the product in partnership with the National Institute of Solar Energy, under the government of India.

The facility will feature 22,000 solar modules, said the company, noting that it will start to deploy them in the summer. The solar plant is expected to be operational in early 2023.
“By carrying out the construction of a PV park and the deconstruction of Superphenics side by side, we are demonstrating once again the complementarity of energies and the company's ability to ensure the complete life cycle of all its industrial installations,” said the director of the 1.24 GW nuclear reactor, Mathieu Ponnet.
The project is part of EDF's solar plan aimed at deploying 30 GW of PV in France.
The Superphenix reactor was commissioned in 1986. It was shut down permanently in 1997, after several years of difficult operations and much public protest. The facility was closed by former French Prime Minister Lionel Jospen due to its high costs, safety issues and several court cases. It is now expected to be dismantled by French conglomerate Areva by 2024.

Bangladesh will have to pay a 0.25% fee and a 0.25% commitment fee per annum for the portion of the total that is not withdrawn. The interest rate is 0.60% plus the variable borrowing cost margin of the AIIB.
Infrastructure Development Co. Ltd. (IDCOL), a Bangladeshi state-owned investor, will lend the funds to support renewable energy, energy efficiency, and social infrastructure projects. By borrowing loans from the Bangladeshi government and international sources, the IDCOL provides low-cost loans to renewable energy sector.
In addition to larger plants, IDCOL is now promoting rooftop solar power installations, especially on top of apparel factories. Thus far, it has approved loans for 41 factories, with a total generation capacity of 50 MW. It has set a target to provide enough funds to support the deployment of 300 MWp of rooftop solar capacity by the end of this year.
About 19.5 MW of rooftop solar plants have already been installed and switched on. One of the biggest ones is a 3.1 MWp array, while the smallest one is of a 324 KWp installation.
IDCOL provides 80% of a project's funds at low cost. The rest is being handled by the customers. About $700,000 is needed to set up a 1 MW rooftop solar power system. The cost of each unit of electricity generated from a rooftop solar power system is lower than the electricity the factory owners get from the power grid. IDCOL also provide funds to set up solar minigrids, solar home systems, solar-run irrigation pumps, and solar street lights.
Bangladesh currently has the capacity to generate 787 MW of renewable energy, of which 553 MW comes from solar. The country is aiming to generate 40% of its total electricity from renewable sources by 2041.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/09/higeco-more-launches-central-plant-controller-for-new-italian-solar-regulations/,"SPONSORED,EUROPE,ITALY",,"MAY 9, 2022",Higeco More launches Central Plant Controller for new Italian solar regulations,"When it comes to balancing the distribution of renewable energy resources across the energy mix, the monitoring and remote control of solar PV plants is essential. In view of this, Higeco More has developed Senergy, a turnkey solar solution to meet the new standards set by Italian electricity market regulator, ARERA.
It is a powerful and flexible Power Plant Controller that monitors and remotely controls power plants, making them compliant with several international Grid Codes, including: European regulation 2016/631; Italian CEI 0-16 2022-03 and Terna Grid Code annex A68; Romanian Ordin 208-18; and UK Ena G99 recommendation; South African Grid Code 2.9.
“Our product allows both the Point of Delivery and the individual generators to be monitored, and the power plant to be regulated, both in autonomous or via external commands,” said the company. “The connection with the DSO / TSO, and any other authorized entities is simple thanks to the various communication protocols supported: IEC61850, IEC60870-101/104, DNP3, Modbus TCP, OPC UA.”
The central plant controller is equipped with a web-based interface that can be accessed both locally and remotely. Cyber security is further guaranteed thanks to the IsaSecure SDLA IEC 62443-4-1 and CSA IEC 62443-4-2 certifications, and the use of IEC 62351 compliant safe transport profiles.
“Hard- earned experience in renewables has allowed us at Higeco More to develop Senergy, a high-tech solution able to satisfy all the technical and certification requirements set by ARERA and the Italian Electrotechnical Committee (CEI) 0-16. From May, it will be possible to pre-order Senergy, to guarantee access to the maximum amount offered by the ARERA bonus. An organised network of installers and a dedicated help desk completes our offer,” said founder and application manager of Higeco More, Fulvio Ferrari.
In accordance with European guidelines for the monitoring and controlling of distributed generation from renewable sources, the CEI has introduced the Central Plant Controller (CCI) as variants V1 and V2 in accordance with standard 0-16. This hardware device offers real-time management by the distributor of production plants with a nominal power greater than 1 MW and connected in medium voltage.
ARERA’s Resolution 540/2021 / R / EEL of 11/30/2021, completed the regulatory framework by making the CCI mandatory for all new plants that are operational starting from Dec. 1, 2022. In addition, all existing plants, together with those that come into operation by Nov. 30, 2022, must install the CCI by Jan. 31, 2024. Finally, the obligation to install the CCI extends to all Medium Voltage plants operating in the Dispatching Market, regardless of their power output.
The good news is that ARERA makes a standard contribution to help cover the expenses incurred for plants subject to the retrofitting of the CCI. This “bonus” is paid out by the Distributor within two months of completion of an application and is equal to €10,000 for conversions made by Mar. 31, 2023, and is reduced by 25% for each subsequent quarter. Failure to install a CCI within the set deadlines incurs a fine that can go as far as invalidating the TICA – a set of regulations issued from ARERA – and will result in the disconnection of the PV system from the power grid.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/09/longis-ambitious-global-green-hydrogen-plans/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"MAY 9, 2022",Longi’s ambitious global green hydrogen plans,"How does Longi view the relationship between hydrogen, solar PV, and storage?  
Li Zhenguo: Longi believes that green power plus green hydrogen is the best solution to achieving carbon neutrality Looking at the progress of solar power over the past 10 years, we believe cost reductions in PV will play a key role in promoting the development of hydrogen. 
Solar power (green electricity) fundamentally reduces carbon emissions in hydrogen production and provides a clean energy source for green hydrogen. Its production is an extensive application of solar energy that can bring hundreds of gigawatt-level increments. In addition, green hydrogen is a new type of energy storage that can address intermittency issues. This is what we call the “green electricity–green hydrogen–green electricity” cycle. 
The world currently consumes about 80 million tons of hydrogen every year, and most of it is gray. If green hydrogen accounts for 15% of consumption, it requires about 450 GW of PV installations to support it. That is why we say solar PV and hydrogen production are inextricably linked in terms of scale and cost.  
As a solar PV company, entering the hydrogen industry requires a strategy change. How have you approached this? 
In 2018, Longi began to conduct strategic research into the hydrogen value chain. On Mar. 31, 2021, we officially established Longi Hydrogen Energy Technology Co., Ltd, and our first hydrogen energy equipment manufacturing plant in Wuxi, China. The first 1,000Nm3 / h alkaline water electrolyzer was officially launched in October 2021, and so far, several more have been delivered to our customers and put into production. The production capacity of the Wuxi plant will reach 1.5 GW by the end of 2022 and is expected to reach 5 GW to 10 GW by 2025. 
The “green power plus green hydrogen” solution fully covers synthetic methanol, synthetic ammonia, steel smelting, petroleum refining, and other industries that are in urgent need of decarbonization. Hydrogen production will grow rapidly due to the substantial expansion of downstream hydrogen energy utilization and dominate in the future era of dual carbon targets. 
As a renewable energy industry leader, we will continue to invest in R&D to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of both solar PV and hydrogen production. Longi Hydrogen has gradually established technology, operations, and marketing teams with experience in large-scale hydrogen energy equipment manufacturing and operations management. In addition, we have developed a five-year development strategy for the hydrogen business and are committed to accelerating the global transition to clean energy. 
What are Longi’s strategic hydrogen plans?  
Longi has launched its alkaline water electrolyzer, which marks a significant milestone, and means we have taken a key step towards becoming a world-leading hydrogen technology company. Our electrolyzer can provide a hydrogen output of 1,000Nm3/h and we have already provided a 4000Nm3/h hydrogen production system for the world's largest green hydrogen project. The service life of the equipment exceeds 200,000 hours. The distributed I/O control system realizes automatic and unattended operation. We will continue to invest in R&D and innovation and push for the development of products based on our technical abilities. 
What is the biggest challenge for the development of hydrogen and how can it be solved? 
Like other green energies, the development of green hydrogen is highly dependent on policy. Interest rates and carbon prices play critical roles in the cost of green hydrogen. We have made a simple calculation: If the technical cost is considered, the cost of green hydrogen is around $1.17 to $1.33 per kg, which is very close to or even lower than that of grey hydrogen. This calculation is sensitive to interest rates. If the local interest is 5%, the cost of green hydrogen will grow to around $3.33. Therefore, green hydrogen is financially competitive in countries with low-interest rates, like Europe and Japan; but there are still cost difficulties in China. 
The second constraint is carbon price. Compared to gray hydrogen production, green hydrogen saves around 20kg of carbon dioxide emissions for each kilogram of hydrogen. Based on the present carbon price in Europe – which means an extra income of about $1.33 – it makes green hydrogen more cost competitive. Therefore, green hydrogen has an absolute economical advantage in regions such as the European Union with low-interest rates and high carbon prices. However, in China, the current carbon price from Shanghai Carbon Exchange is only around $8.33 per metric ton, which means a compensation rate of around $0.17 for green hydrogen per kg. This is far from enough for the development of China’s green hydrogen.  
We believe China needs more policy support and has a long way to go to achieve large-scale commercialization and hydrogen energy industrialization. First, we need a standard definition of “green hydrogen” and a clear penetration target for our fourteenth and fifteenth five-year plans. The country ought to encourage the use of water electrolysis with renewable energy.  
Second, green hydrogen must be included in the energy management system, and green hydrogen incentive policies must be introduced. The industry needs appropriate subsidies and incentives for green hydrogen and improvement of the carbon trading market. Lastly, like in the Top-Runner program for solar PV, we can promote and demonstrate advanced hydrogen technology in the hydrogen top-runner program initiated by the government. I believe with the support of the state and joint efforts of all market players, China’s green hydrogen industry will grow rapidly and contribute to the realization of the dual carbon targets. 
What are the trends in green hydrogen prices? 
It is possible to realize $0.25 per cubic meter on the production side. The cost rise in the PV industry supply chain in the past two years is temporary. I believe the cost of solar PV will continue to decline, and eventually, in many places, PV power will reach 3.33 cents or even lower per KWh. In that case, the power cost for water electrolysis would be around $0.15 per cubic meter, thus allowing hydrogen to achieve$0.25 per cubic meter.  
What are the main applications of green hydrogen? 
We see a variety of industries that need hydrogen, and especially green hydrogen. For example, in petroleum refining, hydrogen is used as a feedstock, reagent, and energy source. Hydrotreating is one of the key links in the refining process, involving processes such as hydrogenation, hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation, and hydrodemetallization. Gasoline and diesel hydrogenation, wax oil hydrogenation, and hydrocracking units also require a lot of hydrogen consumption. The global oil refining industry consumes 38 million tons of hydrogen every year, accounting for 33% of the global hydrogen demand. The International Energy Agency estimates that demand for hydrogen in the refining industry will continue to grow. Meanwhile, tighter standards for air pollutants will lead to an extra 7% increase in hydrogen use in refining.  
In the field of iron and steel smelting, we can use green hydrogen instead of coke as the main reducing agent to reduce iron ore to produce steel. Unlike conventional blast furnaces using carbon monoxide as a reducing agent, which will result in a large amount of carbon dioxide emissions, the utilization of hydrogen will reduce these and realize low-carbon or zero-carbon steelmaking. The steel industry has long been one of the industrial sectors with the most significant carbon emissions, accounting for 18% of China's total carbon emissions – second only to the power generation and heating sector. That is why we say the use of hydrogen steelmaking technology to replace the traditional steelmaking process will contribute to achieving Chinas carbon neutrality targets. 
What role will hydrogen play in helping China achieve its carbon targets? 
When we talk about carbon neutrality, there must be a carbon sink to correspond to the carbon dioxide emission limit. China has only a few hundred million tons of forest carbon sink per year, which cannot fulfill the national emission demands.  
Today, 42% of China's carbon dioxide emissions are tied to electricity generation, and the remaining are mainly from energy, chemical, iron and steel smelting, and other fields. Vehicles in future cities can be decarbonized directly with clean electricity, but ocean freighters and aviation aircraft cannot do this. The battery energy density is still too low to provide continuous power for long-distance transportation. In addition, daily heating, cooking, and other energy consumption activities also need cleaner energy. Therefore, the introduction of green hydrogen can help human society to achieve deep decarbonization.

The Varta.wall product features a die-cast aluminum housing and requires an installation depth of only 10 centimeters. It is described by the manufacturer as one of the most space-saving storage systems on the market.
The high-voltage battery was developed in Germany and is manufactured at an unspecified location in Europe. It is available with a capacity of between 10 kWh and 20 kWh and its output ranges from 5.24 kW and 10.4 kW depending on the PV inverter used. Up to five systems can be connected together.
The storage system is capable of emergency power, with a special boost function leading to increased security of supply in emergency power operation. This increases the discharge rate (C rate), which is 0.5 in continuous operation, to 0.75 for a short time. As a result, the storage system can absorb peak loads, such as those that occur when electronic devices are started.
According to Varta, the installation of the storage systems is flexible and simple. This starts with the PV inverter compatibility, continues with the modularity and also includes the innovative solar module design and connector system.
“As a result, the storage can be installed in less than 30 minutes,” explains Dominik Gluba, Head of Operations Energy Storage Systems.
Varta.wall is compatible with various inverter brands, including SMA and Kostal. Further compatibilities are being prepared. The plug-in system ensures that no wiring of the system components is necessary.

The system is based on heterojunction solar cell technology with an efficiency of 22% and a bifaciality of up to 90%. Its temperature coefficient is -0.26 C.
“The mini modules are from our suppliers, we cannot disclose details at the moment, but we are working with suppliers both in Europe and Asia,” said Mongstad. “Currently, we are doing assembly at locations in Norway and Spain, and the units for our pilot installations so far are 100% manufactured in Europe, including the solar panels.” 
Called HM–1 QUATTRO–220S, the system creates a 10 cm distance from the rooftop to the lower edge of the solar panels, which will be suitable for the bulk of green roofs with sedum plants.
“The product is also easy to retrofit on existing green roofs, where there is a total of tens of millions of square meters available, especially in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, but also in Scandinavia and other European countries,” said Mongstad.
The units consist of a mounting system and solar panels in a single pre-assembled piece, which the manufacturer said makes them very fast to mount. The geometry with low-building vertical panels has no or very low need for fastening or ballast, which further simplifies the mounting job. Each unit measures 1,600 mm x 1,510 mm x 350 mm and weighs 24.5 kg. It also features an IP68 enclosure rating and 3.2 mm double-tempered glass.
“The mounting systems are made of aluminum and provide support for each panel, while also tying together the installation as a whole for better wind load performance,” Mongstad said. 
The system is sold with a 12-year product warranty and a 25-year performance warranty.
“The great benefit for the customer will be that our warranty also includes the mounting system, not only the solar panel,” said Mongstad. “The building owners and building planners we talk to especially appreciate the accessibility to the rooftop for maintenance after mounting, as it is easy to walk around in the installation and move single or multiple units if local maintenance of the roofing membrane below is needed. This comes in addition to the valuable energy production profile, as well as other benefits such as a low roof load of 10 kg/m2.”
The company wants to sell its systems in Europe in 2022 and 2023, with a focus on Scandinavia and northern Europe.
The new product will be on display at booth A4.254 at the Smarter E trade show.

This cell configuration reportedly allows for full area passivation and contact at the same time.
The solar panel is available in two versions: a 400 W product with a power conversion efficiency of 22.3% and a white frame; and a black 395 W module with an efficiency of 22%.
Both measure 1,717 mm × 1,045 mm × 32 mm and weigh in at 19.9 kg. The have a temperature coefficient of -0.30%, which the manufacturer said is an improvement on industry-standard modules. They come with a 25-year product warranty and a 25-year performance warranty. The first-year degradation is said to be 1.5% and 25-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 90.58% of the nominal output power.
The module also features Q Cells Yield Security technology, which includes anti-potential-induced degradation (PID) and anti-light-induced degradation (LID), as well as protection from hot spots. “Another inherent feature of Q.antum technology is Tra.Q, which is Q Cells’ unique laser identification process that traces and monitors every single cell manufactured by the company, to guard against counterfeiting,” said the spokesperson. “We also secured QCPV certification from TÜV Rheinland, which ensures long-term reliability thanks to TÜV Rheinland’s production monitoring and material testing.”
According to the manufacturer, the solar module is already available in South Korea and will soon be introduced into leading European markets.

The heart of downtown Melbourne is known for many things: little “Instagrammable” lanes of graffiti, trendy cafes, trams, museums, and of course, its cluster of skyscrapers shooting up out of nowhere like the Emerald City of Oz. But what those walking the streets of Victorian capital can’t see 145 meters above their heads is that there are 500 Trina Solar modules operating as a 223 kW system atop Towers One, Two and Four of Walker Corp.’s Collins Square Tower site.
Putting solar panels on rooftops is hardly newsworthy; indeed, Australia is the world leader of solar rooftop installation. But putting solar atop skyscrapers is not so common, partly because the generation profile has not been worthwhile. After all, the point of tall buildings is that the roof represents only a tiny fraction of the structure’s overall square footage.
However, thanks to recent advances in solar panel energy density, that profile has changed. Recognizing this, Walker Corp., one of Australia’s largest private development companies, teamed up with Venergy Australia to deliver the SolarEdge-optimized solar system to its Collins Square Tower development.
“With the advances in solar technology, energy-dense panels now available exceed 450 W per panel, enabling significant and meaningful renewable projects in CBD locations that couldn’t otherwise be achieved on the constrained rooftop,” said Venergy Australia CEO Matthew Wilkins.
Venergy integrated the 223 kW solar system with the building’s regenerative lifts and its trigeneration of 600 kW gas turbines across five commercial towers, bringing the site’s total generating capacity to 2 MW.
Cameron Forbes, engineering and sustainability manager for Walker Corp., told pv magazine the company strives to ensure its towers are equipped with “advanced solar technology” that can be fully integrated with “our existing energy monitoring and management systems, enabling our team to constantly track the panels’ performance.”
Two to tango
The Collins Square Tower solar setup is not the only sky-scraping solar array in town. In fact, Cbus Property announced in November 2021 that it’s planning to clad a $1 billion commercial office tower in Melbourne’s central business district with a “solar skin” that is capable of generating 20% of the project’s base building electricity requirements.
Looking at these two projects, we see two differing ways to integrate solar into high-rise buildings: rooftop solar and building-integrated PV (BIPV). But by combining the two, we may be looking at the future of energy-integrated construction in vertical cities – namely, the two-punch generation combo of integrating both energy-dense rooftop panels and BIPV.
That combo is precisely what the Monash University-based ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science found, in collaboration with the University of Lisbon. Researchers 3D modeled the viability and impact of window-integrated photovoltaics alongside other solar technologies at a city scale. Published in the journal Solar Energy, the study found that buildings in Melbourne could provide 74% of their own electricity needs if solar technology was fully integrated into roofs, walls and windows. Rooftop solar would constitute 88% of this supply, with wall-integrated and window-integrated solar delivering 8% and 4%, respectively.
The research team, including study co-author Professor Jacek Jasieniak, looked at central Melbourne. They then determined the annual solar irradiation on Melbourne’s building surfaces to identify suitable areas for PV, taking into account cost factors, technical limitations, shading and shadows. And at city scale – including warehouse-sized rooftops in city surrounds such as ports and stadiums, like the famous Melbourne Cricket Ground – the rooftop capacity potential is staggering.
“Our goal was to showcase that actually there is huge potential (for urban PV, particularly rooftop), it’s just enormous,” said Jasieniak. “But people don’t think about it because people tend to think at the scale of a building rather than the scale of a city. As technology evolves, what we will find is that the incremental costs to add the PV components into the buildings is going to make the value proposition for integration very strong. Our driver for this study was to understand the opportunity for window-integrated solar cells, and what came out of the study was that actually, for most buildings, rooftop is very attractive. It’s the low-hanging fruit out there.”
But Jasieniak notes that rooftop primacy will remain the case as long as walls and windows (BIPV) still require a technology revolution. Compared to rooftop, the cost of a solar window is “an order of magnitude higher than what you would pay for a solar cell on a roof … f your building is costing you, say, AUD 1 billion, and you’re spending AUD 40 million on solar cells which over the course of their lifetime will bring back electricity, that is the important part to consider. The upfront cost is not the driving force, it should always be the levelized cost of electricity. It’s always a question of payback period, it won’t be seven years, but does it really need to be in a commercial building that will last at least 40 years? I don’t think so.”
Jim Stewart, associate director at Fender Katsalidis – the Australian architectural firm behind the world’s second-tallest building, Kuala Lumpur’s 678.9-meter Merdeka 118 building, topped with a 140 kW solar array for its Park Hyatt Kuala Lumpur hotel … told pv magazine that clients are encouraged to consider PV solutions, as “most buildings over 180 meters tall are not demolished within 50 years.”
“Rooftop solar arrays have become common place in skyscraper design and development,” Stewart said. “And, in the Australian context, their economic viability has been proven and accepted. Space is always limited however, so ever-increasing densities allow us to push further in terms of design flexibility and system capacity. In the context of high-rise development, PV is a mature and affordable technology with the ability to power building services and reduce peak loads on the grid; a ‘no-brainer’ indeed.”
Key challenges
Along with the sheer potential of PV in vertical cities come challenges. Firstly, most PV installations would be brownfield retrofits on existing rooftops, which can be problematic, as tall buildings often have other infrastructure already.
Another challenge is that tall buildings tend to be rented, making it difficult to clarify whose responsibility and direct benefit PV would be. “But there’s a value proposition in that,” argued Jasieniak. “There has been a business-sentiment shift – companies are now demanding 10-star building requirements, and at that level you need onsite energy generation.”
But builders are also required to change and support PV integration.
“A lot of these building companies just do what they’ve done for a long time,” argued Jasieniak. “Innovation to building practices is needed to support construction at scale.”
Nevertheless, Jasieniak sees a future where tall buildings boast rooftop PV, with BIPV further down the line, and possibly net-zero carbon buildings. Before then, he says there are tough questions in terms of policy, and value shifts in both individual companies and for developers and builders in terms of PV integration. “I think there is a market segmentation opportunity there, too.”

Indian module manufacturer Saatvik has developed bifacial PV modules with 21.12% efficiency and 545 W of peak power output. The multi-busbar modules feature half-cut passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) cells based on M10-sized monocrystalline wafers.
The backside of the bifacial module provides up to 25% additional power gain. The bifacial gain is significant on grassland, dry sand, and especially in snowfields. The modules come with a linear warranty of up to 30 years.
Recently, Saatvik raised its manufacturing output to 1 GW through the addition of a 500 MW mono PERC panel factory in Haryana. The new production base is equipped to make mono PERC, half-cut, multi-busbar technology to produce high-efficiency solar modules with power outputs of 530 Wp to 610 Wp. Saatvik is also coming up with an additional 1.2 GW of capacity in Gandhidham, Gujarat.

Hydrogen is increasingly the focus of research on using renewable resources for energy storage, especially in light of the Department of Energy’s Hydrogen Energy Earthshot, a goal to cut the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to $1 per kilogram in a decade. With hydrogen from renewable energy currently at about $5 per kilogram, researchers are looking at many ways of cutting those costs.
At the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL), researchers are looking at perovskite materials, which could be used in a process to produce hydrogen in a renewable manner. The focus of their study is an emerging water-splitting technology called solar thermochemical hydrogen (STCH) production, which can be potentially more energy efficient than producing hydrogen via the commonly used electrolysis method. The researchers evaluated the performance of various STCH materials in the context of a system platform to assess techno-economic benefits and what the challenges would be to scaling up STCH production.
“It’s certainly a very challenging field, and it has a lot of research questions still unanswered, mainly on the materials perspective,” said Zhiwen Ma, a senior engineer at NREL and lead author of a new paper, “System and Technoeconomic Analysis of Solar Thermochemical Hydrogen Production,” which appears in the journal Renewable Energy. His co-authors, all from NREL, are Patrick Davenport and Genevieve Saur.
The paper complements ongoing materials discovery research by examining how different materials may bring costs down. One of the challenges in the research was in identifying perovskites capable of handling the high temperatures required while hitting performance targets. Another challenge is that in STCH, the PV cells used only capture a part of the solar spectrum, and STCH uses the entire spectrum. Research to identify the best materials for STCH is critical to the success of this method for hydrogen production, the scientists noted.
“The material has not necessarily been found,” Saur said, “but this analysis is to provide some boundaries for where we think the costs will be if the materials meet some of the targets and expectations that the research community envisions.”
