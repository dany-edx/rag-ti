While there was 5 GW of US PV production in 2022, according to NREL, there have been some 70 GW of manufacturing capacity announcements made since the launch of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
What is particularly noteworthy is that manufacturing in the United States is expanding further up the supply chain – from module assembly to PV cell production. Cell investment and production is both more capex intensive and technologically challenging. Given this, it makes sense for manufacturers to develop sophisticated technology roadmaps, in an attempt to future-proof their production facilities.
While Passivated Emitter Rear Cell (PERC) technology has been the workhorse of the modern solar industry, it is becoming increasingly clear that increases in mass production efficiencies are becoming more difficult to achieve. Recent reports have PERC cell efficiencies topping out at 23.3%. This is a confirmation that manufacturers have reached the technical limitations of PERC in terms of efficiency.
It should come as no surprise then that of the approximately 60 GW of new cell capacity added globally in Q2, the majority of it was in the form of new Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) lines. But what comes next?
Heterojunction (HJT) and Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) cells are established technologies that can advance efficiencies beyond PERC. Looking further ahead, perovskite tandem PV cells represent a genuine “step change” cell technology, with efficiencies well beyond that of conventional PV cells.
In May 2023, perovskite tandem developer Oxford PV achieved an efficiency record of 28.6% on an M4-format cell – in a result verified by Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE. It is a remarkable achievement and points to a bright future for what Oxford PV terms “perovskite-on-silicon” tandem PV cells. However, scaling such devices to module or mini-module level introduces a range of new challenges, not least measuring the Stabilizing Power Output (SPO) of these devices.
Measurement challenges
As can be expected with a new technology, perovskite tandem cells and modules require a new approach when it comes to measurement and characterization. For the past five years, Eternal Sun has been working with the leading research institutes and early-stage companies in their development of perovskite tandem devices – including NREL, GCL nano, Kaust, QUT, Utmo Light, Microquanta, and others that can’t be disclosed.

The unique measurement challenges posed by perovskite and perovskite-tandem PV devices are myriad. Eternal Sun plays a role in addressing these challenges and I serve as a member of the technical working groups that are developing the standards for perovskite device measurement. Here is an overview of the measurement challenges posed by PV perovskite measurement based on Eternal Sun’s work with prospective perovskite manufacturers and research institutes.
Accurate measurement of SPO in perovskite devices requires:
– Pre-conditioning of the device, through light soaking of approximately 2-10 minutes, to achieve stabilization.
– Multi Peak Power (MPP) tracking under continuous illumination – most commonly using the “Perturb and Observe” method at appropriate perturb and step intervals.
– Slow IV curve measurement, of approximately one minute, to measure stabilized output values (for Isc, Voc etc.) which can overcome hysteresis effects.
– Application of dark (night) cycles to produce an accurate module energy yield measurement.
– High level of temperature (<-4C) and light (<2%) uniformity, as variation can lead to significantly different measurement outcomes.
– Ability to calibrate the light source for perovskite tandem devices – particularly in the case of two-terminal cells (see Figure 1).
– Temperature control (25C), for tandems, to avoid the differing temperature coefficients of the semiconductor layers impacting accurate measurement.

In August, Eternal Sun hosted a webinar outlining these technical challenges and the latest developments in relevant standards, which can be accessed here.
Given these requirements for accurate perovskite PV device and tandem device measurement Eternal Sun developed LED-based solar simulators in two sizes to facilitate the testing of individual devices or multiple modules. The measurement requirements of perovskite devices, outlined above, can be fulfilled by these steady-state solar simulators as listed in the table below.

Eternal Sun’s solar simulators for perovskite measurement have been adopted widely by research institutes and R&D laboratories. The installed base of Eternal Sun LED steady-state technology will exceed 100 tools by the end of 2024.
From lab to fab
Through the work of Eternal Sun experts, along with our industry and research colleagues, the development of industry standards for perovskite measurement is progressing well, namely the IEC TR 63228. And the good news is that industry norms are becoming clear and being adopted in the standard.
But that’s not to say that standardized measurement norms are locked in for testing in large scale production. The testing regime that is leading to the best SPO results includes testing times too long for mass production. It will presumably take some years of intensive work before an in-line regime, suitable for factories rather than laboratories, can be agreed on and adopted. Despite this, Eternal Sun believes that it is likely, as with the current practices for thin films, that a combination of 100% inline testing with offline, or sample, testing will yield reliable results.
Horses for courses
As their track record demonstrates, Eternal Sun LED sun simulators are proving crucial in the maturation of promising perovskite PV technology and in perovskite tandem devices. However, LED-based measurement equipment remains only a part of the Eternal Sun product portfolio.
Xenon-based solar simulators remain the “gold standard” in mass production at PV module manufacturing sites the world over. Xenon light sources continue to offer a full light spectrum, over 99% spectral coverage, to module makers at an attractive capex and opex.
Beyond the unique measurement challenges posed by perovskite technology, Xenon-based measurement equipment remains the trusted technology for leading solar research laboratories. Xenon is the accepted reference light source, and no lab is using only LEDs in their testing.
Eternal Sun’s range of Xenon-based equipment can chart its development back as far as 1980 – through Spire Solar, which Eternal Sun acquired in 2016.  The company also has arguably the longest track record in the supply of devices with long, steady state illumination, a prerequisite for the measurement and testing of modules that deploy perovskite technology.
There is no doubt that PV perovskites and tandems deserve their place on the development pathway of solar manufacturers both new and established. The promise of 28%+ conversion efficiencies represents a major step towards solar seizing a place of primacy in the global energy economy. And accurate and reliable measurement will play a central role in this development.
Eternal Sun is currently developing a white paper exploring the latest in the use of LEDs in perovskite module measurement. Myself and other members of the Eternal Sun team will be on the ground in Las Vegas, for the RE+ show this week. Be sure to get in touch to find out how LED solar simulators can play a role in your company or research institute executing on their technology roadmaps.

The China-based inverter manufacturer said the HYS-LV-USG1 Series can be used with DC- and AC-coupled PV systems and 120 V to 240 V of backup power without an external autotransformer.
The new products have a nominal power rating ranging from 3.8 kW to 11.5 kW and an efficiency of 97.6%. They also feature a California Energy Commission (CEC) efficiency rating of 97.0% and offer 32 A of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) current.
The smallest model measures 502 mm × 615 mm × 202 mm and weighs 31 kg. The largest version measures 502 mm × 740 mm × 202 mm and weighs 41 kg. The MPPT voltage range for all products is 125 V to 500 V, and the battery voltage range is 40 V t0 60 V.
The devices also have integrated arc fault protection and rapid shutdown functionality. Hoymiles said the hybrid inverters can switch between power sources depending on energy production, price, and usage.
“By acting as a medium between solar and grid energy, we ensure electricity is not just accessible but also adaptable and reliable,” said Neutron Wang, product director at Hoymiles. “The industry-leading DC/AC ratio of 1.5 results in significantly lower cost when compared with systems of the same capacity using other inverters.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/12/impact-of-overcapacity-on-solar-stocks/,"GEOPOLITICS,INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,CHINA,GERMANY,UNITED STATES",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2023",Impact of overcapacity on solar stocks,"Most solar module producers and inverter manufacturers have taken a significant beating on stock exchanges over the last few months, well before module capacity expansion announcements. Jenny Chase, solar analyst at BloombergNEF, said that there is an oversupply across the entire value chain.
“Module and polysilicon prices crashed,” Chase told pv magazine. “There is a lot of inventory of modules in different markets. That means that, although installations are still booming and there is no sign of slowing down, the prospects for individual companies are not generally good, as they are selling more at a lower profit.”
Polysilicon prices spiked to more than $30/kg throughout most of 2022. Since the start of this year, they have fallen from $30.50 to just around $9 today.
Chase said that supply has finally caught up with demand. She said polysilicon prices have had a significant impact on polysilicon makers.
“New Chinese factories have come online and produce a lot of material. There is just enough of that,” she said. “It also has knock-on effects because it lowers the barriers to entry across the value chain, with additional competition from new entrants. It also means that any company with inventory, which is basically all of them, sees a reduced value of what they have in stock.”
Chase said that module prices were expected to decrease, but not to this extent. Module prices dropped from $0.22 to $0.24 at the beginning of the year to $0.15 today.
Rebecca McManus, renewables lead at Aurora Energy Research, agrees on the significant role played by the decline in polysilicon prices. She noted ongoing manufacturing capacity expansion in China, and plans to expand manufacturing capacity in Europe and North America.
“The rapid expansion of production capacity by Chinese manufacturers has outpaced the growth in demand,” McManus told pv magazine. “This is particularly relevant as prices there are normally two-thirds of the production prices in Europe.”
Similar European announcements are broadening the gap between supply and demand.
“There has been a big push for a more European-led manufacturing of the solar modules. Instead of importing from China, European countries want to produce 30 GW by 2025,” said McManus, noting that EU subsidy reforms are a crucial pillar of this EU strategy.
However, there is potentially another element to the EU plans.
“The new European policies could penalize developers not sourcing from Europe, but from China,” said McManus. “There is a geopolitical risk connected to that.”
The United States is a somewhat similar case, although with some differences. The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides opex support for local manufacturing capacity, while EU support is mostly capex-based.
“The IRA is incentivizing capacity manufacturing locally in the US, setting up funding for that,” said McManus. “The US has a large budget for encouraging local manufacturing.”
A second geopolitical risk is related to the supply chains, with China controlling most polysilicon production. Possible tensions could take a toll on European module manufacturers that rely on polysilicon imports from China.
On the other hand, geopolitical risks don’t simply have a bearish effect on stock prices. In some cases, they are pushing up the stock prices of American companies. While several US-based companies have seen the value of their stocks increase by up to 35%, Chinese players have seen decreases of up to 40% to 45%.
“First Solar is an index of US-China trade tensions at the moment. First Solar is expanding because the US has a trade war going on with China and it is trying to restore manufacturing,” said Chase. “Every time there is an intensification of the trade war First Solar is up.”
Other US solar companies are suffering, though – especially in the inverter and microinverter business.
“Some of that could be just that there are other microinverters coming into the market,” explained Chase. “When stock prices change, it does not necessarily mean that there is something bad that has happened to the company, but that the company is not doing as well as the investors expect they would.”
Nonetheless, European manufacturers are considering scaling up operations in the United States.
“Meyer Burger is reallocating the equipment it ordered for Europe to the Colorado factory. Basically, it has bet on the American market,” said Chase, adding that the company reported disappointing results due to the crash of Chinese module prices.
The idea is that Europe should pour more money into domestic manufacturing, especially if it anticipates an escalation of geopolitical tensions.
“US wants to keep the Chinese modules out. Europe has the more realistic goal of having some supply chain that is not Chinese, and ideally some in Europe, in case geopolitical tensions ramp up, so we don’t have a situation where the West is digging up things to burn, while China is running on solar and wind,” said Chase.
She said she feels more certain that European manufacturers will be getting major capex grants than she was six months ago. Still, doubts remain. “How much is that going to help if your opex is higher than the selling price of modules?”
McManus noted that technological developments can have a negative effect on stocks.
“As the technology is maturing, the actual installation costs increase. But there is another element: the size of the installation is changing,” said McManus. “The lifetime of the inverters will have an effect too. Previously, the usual lifetime for inverters was 12 to 15 years, now 25 to 30 years. There is also a similarity for modules. They will last longer and will be more efficient.”
But not everybody agrees.
“I don’t think that most companies tracking stock market investments care much about higher efficiency,” said Chase. “Although they want to invest in companies that have good manufacturing, which generally means being able to increase efficiency without increasing costs.”
The two analysts agree that stock prices for module and inverter manufacturers will reflect the capacity of companies to embrace, if not anticipate, technological advancements in the highly competitive sector, potentially leading to bankruptcies in the coming months, despite the installation boom.
“You can have a very highly successful solar sector, with many companies going bankrupt,” concluded Chase. “I think we should expect quite a lot of bankruptcies and some exits.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/12/ampt-introduces-70-kw-output-solar-string-optimizer/,"INVERTERS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2023",Ampt introduces 70 kW output solar string optimizer,"From pv magazine USA
Colorado-based Ampt announced it has released the i50 String Optimizer, a DC optimizer that builds on the company’s i32 model. The i50 supports up to 70 kW of output power.
The optimizer supports system voltages between 600 V and 1500 V, output currents between 32 A and 50 A, and output power between 15 kW to 70 kW. A full spec sheet can be found here.
Ampt’s string optimizers are designed to boost solar output and can support major utility-scale projects. The i32 model has been used in a 380 MW solar-plus-storage in California and a 390 MW project in Chile, the largest solar-plus-storage plant in the nation. 
The company’s string optimizers are DC/DC converters that deliver power from the PV array at a fixed voltage. A high fixed voltage allows the system to operate at lower current for a given power, thereby reducing the cost and quantity of electrical components like cables, energy storage, inverters and transformers.
Ampt String Optimizers have two inputs and one output back to the inverter. The optimizers are located between the PV source circuits and the combiner box on a PV system. The optimizer performs maximum power point tracking on each input and delivers full available power to the output at a voltage set by the inverter. This is done without requiring communication between the inverter and optimizers.
The optimizer also has maximum power point tracking on each of its two input strings of PV modules. This mitigates or eliminates mismatch losses to deliver more energy under changing environmental and system conditions over the lifetime of the power plant.
“We’re proud to present the new i50 String Optimizer to the market, which is designed to improve the economics of today’s largest, most advanced PV power plants and solar-plus-storage systems,” said Levent Gun, chief executive officer, Ampt.
The 70 kW output allows a single power optimizer to be deployed on each solar tracker. By enabling higher input currents, paralleled PV strings, and flexible string lengths, designers can boost the utilization of each solar tracker without typical string sizing constraints, said Ampt.
Ampt string optimizers include a technology called V-match to automatically match the DC bus voltage while delivering full available power from the solar array. This increases system design flexibility, simplifies controls, and unlocks value across diverse applications.
The optimizers also include a direct-to-battery feature which allows them to connect directly to the battery and follow its state-of-charge voltage while delivering full power from the PV array. The optimizer, battery, and battery inverter share the same DC bus without using battery converters.
Ampt will be exhibiting at RE+ in Las Vegas, Nevada from September 12-14 at booth #1746.

Image: volytica diagnostics GmbH
In a fully charged battery cell, billions of lithium (Li) atoms are trapped in the “anode” porous reservoir, typically a thin sheet of a particular material. The anode and the opposite side, the “cathode,” are conductively connected to the positive and negative terminals of the battery cell. Hundreds or thousands of cells are assembled into a battery system. In the anode, lithium atoms, or ions, are ready to travel to the opposite reservoir, the cathode.
This cumbersome parkour is triggered by externally connecting the anode and cathode to the rest of the asset, for example inverters, motors, and power sources. Once the circuit is closed, the ions queue to exit the anode for the cathode, each releasing an electron which travels a long tour, via the external circuit, to power the asset – the stream of electrons leaving batteries is the electric current. Each ion and electron will reunite on the other side until the battery is charged again.
Released ions force their way through an intermediate medium designed for swift transport while keeping anode and cathode separate – a distance of only micrometers – to avoid short circuiting, with catastrophic results. This intermediate material must be permeable, light, and thin, but insulating and robust, causing headaches for engineers and reducing battery capacity per volume and weight. Low-viscosity chemical liquids or polymers – the electrolyte – are submerged in a matrix, or “separator” in the current mainstream approach. Another option is solid-state li-ion batteries, with liquid electrolyte and separator replaced by a solid material, often exotic ceramics. The topic of solid-state batteries, however, is an article all on its own.
After passing through electrolyte and separator, lithium ions slow to avoid crowding upon entry to the cathode and, one-by-one, migrate slowly into their new host material, finding energetically advantageous positions in the cathode lattice. Think of passengers boarding an empty train: the first find numerous free seats and rapidly occupy them, making space for queueing followers. The more seats that are taken, however, the slower the boarding process becomes. Macroscopically speaking, battery charging is quick initially but the longer you charge, the slower it gets. In electric cars, the final 20% of charge can take as long as the initial 80%.
The whole process is somewhat more complex than boarding a train, however. It involves ion interaction with a multitude of different materials, at different speeds, temperatures, stress levels, and in different processes. Battery degradation issues hinge on factors such as the effect of temperature on electrolyte viscosity, and thus the process speed of this crucial voyage. Also, as the “best seats” are taken, step by step, the host materials slightly expand, adding mechanical expansion stress and potentially leading to internal cracks and fissures. It is obvious that the way of charging, discharging, and operating a battery will dramatically affect the magnitude and rate of degradation processes that lead to the well-known loss of capacity, and also to safety-critical side processes.
In terms of different battery chemistries and the abbreviations mentioned above, the anode reservoir is traditionally made of graphite, albeit with a myriad of secret additives, manufacturing, and processing variations. LTO batteries are an exception which will be considered shortly.
For cathodes, things become more complicated. Cathode materials made of varying amounts of nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), controversial cobalt (Co) – and sometimes also aluminum (Al) – plus other secret additives, are referred to as NMC or NCA (nickel-cobalt-aluminum) devices. Such cathodes typically have high energy density, meaning they can accommodate a high number of lithium ions per volume but have shorter lifetimes, lower safety margins, and a bigger price tag than rival chemistries as a result.
To satisfy the automotive industry’s hunger for energy density and range, engineers crank up the nickel content – the first NMC batteries had equal parts of the three components, were dubbed NMC 1-1-1, and offered decent energy density and robust safety characteristics. Nowadays, industry adds eight times more Ni than manganese and cobalt, for NMC 811 batteries. These offer much greater range but significantly shorter lifetime and safety characteristics. That’s right, average li-ion NMC lifetimes and safety are decreasing.
By contrast, the second dominant cathode type is lithium iron-phosphate, also known as LiFePO4 or lithium ferro-phosphate. These cathodes feature lower energy density than NMC devices but are more robust and – at least traditionally – more affordable. Increasingly popular, LFP-based batteries are almost entirely manufactured by Chinese producers. LFP systems are handicapped by the fact their voltage varies little over a wide range of battery state-of-charge levels. State of charge, or SOC, is the amount of charge, or energy, in a battery. Less flexible voltage makes balancing and control of systems, as well as determining SOC, difficult and renders LFP applications generally prone to unexpected operational problems and downtime, further aggravating their lower energy density.
As mentioned, there is an exotic battery variant which uses lithium-titanate (lithium titan oxide, or LTO) for the anode, rather than graphite, sometimes paired with an LFP cathode. These devices offer very low energy density (even lower than legacy nickel-metal hydride, NiMH, chemistry) and can cost 50% to 150% as much as NMC cells because they offer between 10 times and 30 times better safety and longevity performance than LFP and NMC systems.
These are broad brush strokes, however, and the terrific variety of li-ion chemistries available offers cell manufacturers the opportunity to push performance in one direction or another. While characteristics can vary as a result, though, a giant leap in energy density for li-ion, without negative effects on aspects such as lifetime, cannot realistically be expected in the near future.

However, the use of ion-selective membranes limits the large-scale applicability of this type of technology.
Now, researchers at the University of Cincinnati have reported a high-voltage membrane-free lithium-based nonaqueous redox flow battery based on all-organic biphasic system that shows superior performance under both static and flow conditions.
The new system has displayed a number of advantages over their liquid cousins, including an initial average discharge voltage of 3.45 V.
“Water has a voltage limit. Once the voltage of an aqueous battery exceeds the stability window of 1.5 volts, the water can decompose or be split into hydrogen and oxygen, which is explosive,” says Jimmy Jiang, corresponding author.
The elimination of membrane-separator, which is a huge component of upfront costs representing as much as 30% of the system cost, is a particularly significant improvement.
“Membranes are super expensive,” Jiang said. “We developed a new type of energy storage material that improves performance at a lower cost. Likewise, membranes are inefficient. They can’t separate the positive and negative sides completely, so there is always crossover.”
The new redox flow battery has demonstrated energy density of approximately 33 Wh/L. It has also showed 81% of capacity for 100 cycles over approximately 45 days with average Coulombic efficiency of 96% and energy efficiency of 82% at the current density of 1.5 mA/cm2 and at a temperature of 27 C.
The research findings are discussed in “Development of high-voltage and high-energy membrane-free non-acqueous lithium-based organic redox flow batteries,” recently published in Nature Communications.

The Fujian Metrology Institute in China has confirmed the result.
The cell has an area of 333.4 cm2 and is based on passivating contacts based on polysilicon and silicon monoxide (SiOx), which reportedly reduce carrier recombination at the metal/silicon interface, thus improving short-circuit current and fill factor.
“Using advanced techniques such as Poly-finger further enhances quantum efficiency across a wide spectrum,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The new materials have dramatically reduced auger recombination of emitter electrodes, resulting in the highest short-wavelength spectral response to external quantum efficiency (EQE) characteristic of over 85% at 300 nm.”
The Chinese manufacturer had achieved an efficiency of 26.24% for the same device in April. “The achievement of an open-circuit voltage as high as 730mV for DAS Solar's TOPCon cells indicates a significant breakthrough in the development of passivation technologies, which holds great significance for the continuous improvement of TOPCon cell efficiency,” said Das Solar CTO, Song Dengyuan, said at the time.
Das Solar is based in headquartered in Quzhou City, Zhejiang province, and currently has an annual TOPCon solar module capacity of 30 GW. Its two largest shareholders are China Huaneng Group and China Merchants Group.

Questions over their long-term stability are one of the main things holding the technology back from commercial production.
Accelerated testing conducted in the laboratory can help researchers and manufacturers to more quickly understand what will likely happen to the cells once installed outdoors, and to address any weaknesses early on. And as PSCs move closer to commercialization, the need for a testing standard that can be universally applied is becoming clearer.
“We must understand how well perovskite solar cells will perform outdoors, under real conditions, to move this technology closer to commercialization,” said Kai Zhu, a senior scientist in the Chemistry and Nanoscience Center at the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). “That’s why we identified accelerated testing protocols that can be conducted in the laboratory to reveal how these cells would function after six months in operation outside.”
Zhu and colleagues at NREL and the University of Toledo put a batch of the latest PSCs, with an initial efficiency of up to 25.5%, through various tests and compared the results to cells that had been installed outdoors for six months. The tests are described in full in the paper “Towards linking lab and field lifetimes of perovskite solar cells,” published in nature.
The PSCs in this study retained more than 93% of their initial efficiency after 5,000 h of continuous illumination. The tests also included thermal cycling, where temperatures fluctuated between -40 C and 85 C. After 1,000 thermal cycles, the cells had lost around 5% of their initial performance.
The results show that tests that expose the PSCs to light at elevated temperatures gave the most accurate impression of how the cells would degrade after six months in the field. The study also showed that the interface between the active perovskite layer and the hole transport layer, consisting of a self-assembled monolayer of indium tin oxide, is also key to the cell’s reliability. When the ion-blocking properties of this layer were improved, the cell’s stability almost tripled – operating for 1000 hours at 85 C, and more than 8000 hours at 50 C with an expected 20% performance loss, which the group says is among the best results recorded to date for a high efficiency perovskite solar cell.

Strong growth is particularly evident in Africa, which will add a billion people.
However, in many countries, population is stable or even falling. There are nine countries with populations larger than 20 million people that are expected to have lower populations in 2050 than today: China, Russia, Japan, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, Ukraine and Poland. The combined population of these countries is expected to fall by 10%, from 2 billion people today to 1.8 billion people in 2050.
A country with a falling population requires less food. In principle, agricultural space could be freed up for other purposes. And one of these purposes could be hosting solar farms. Let us explore how much solar PV energy could be harvested from freed-up agricultural land. Solar panels are over 100 times more efficient at converting solar energy into useful energy than biomass energy from sugar cane, which is the world’s largest crop by mass. With solar PV, relatively small areas of agricultural land can produce large quantities of electricity.
We make the following assumptions for 2050:
· The world reaches zero fossil fuel consumption.
· Solar and wind drive electrification of transport, heating, and industry.
· Solar and wind drive electrolytic production of large amounts of hydrogen for chemicals [ammonia, metals, ceramics, plastics, synthetic aviation fuels, etc.] including energy exports from sunbelt countries to Europe and elsewhere.
· Everybody in the world catches up to the per capita energy consumption of high-income countries.
· Agricultural land is freed up for solar PV farms in the same ratio as population decline. Typical electricity consumption today in high-income countries is 7-12 MWh per person per year. This needs to double or triple to get rid of all fossil fuel consumption, depending upon participation in the chemical industry. We assume that the energy consumption of 9.7 billion people reaches 20 MWh per person per year (all needs inclusive) in mid-century. Thus, an affluent, fully electrified, and fully decarbonized world will need about 200,000 TWh per year of electricity. For comparison, global electricity consumption today is about 30,000 TWh per year.
We maximize energy harvest per unit area by assuming dense arrays of high-efficiency solar panels with low [10 degrees] tilt scattered all over the globe, but mainly in sunbelt countries. The nominal power of each block of solar panels is assumed to be 200 W per m2 and their efficiency to be 20% efficiency. The blocks of solar panels are scattered throughout agricultural regions. The annual energy yield (MWh/MW) for each region is calculated using the capacity factor calculator in the Global Solar Atlas. Table 1 shows (B) the projected population in 2050; (C) the expected population decline from 2022 to 2050; (D) the agricultural land in 2022; (E) the freed-up agricultural land in 2050 caused by population decline; (F) the potential solar generation from the free-up land; and (G) the required generation in 2050 to provide 20 MWh of electricity per person per year.
A B C D E F G
Population in 2050 (millions) Population decline by 2050 Agricultural land in 2022 (1000 km2) Freed-up land in 2050 (1000 km2) Potential extra generation (TWh/year) Required generation (TWh/year)

(1000 km2)

(1000 km2)
 
For all countries except South Korea, solar generation on freed-up agricultural land (Column F) is sufficient (or much more than sufficient) to provide the energy required (Column G) to operate a fully decarbonized economy. Indeed, the total area of potentially available land across the 9 countries is sufficient to provide two thirds of the energy required (143,000 TWh) by a fully electrified, decarbonized, affluent, global population of 10 billion people in 2050.
In addition, of course, there will also be large energy contributions from rooftop solar, floating solar, solar farms in arid areas, solar in combination with agriculture (agrivoltaics), wind, hydro and other sources.
This is a naive calculation for illustrative purposes only. Importantly, Russia and Ukraine export large fractions of their agricultural output, and so declining populations in those countries do not lead to a declining need for agricultural production. Additionally, countries might devote newly available agricultural land to other purposes, including agriculture for export, increasing agricultural self-sufficiency, alternative crops with lower yield [such as meat], forests, and restoring ecosystems.
However, there is a real opportunity in China, Japan, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Poland, to harvest substantial fractions of required solar energy from agricultural land freed up by declining populations.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/12/the-importance-of-solar-mini-grids-in-universalizing-energy-access/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2023",The importance of solar mini-grids in universalizing energy access,"A recent article in The Washington Post, which criticized the push for renewable energy in India and Africa, prompted me to reflect on three important narratives. Firstly, let's explore the ABC model (Anchor, Business, and Community) in the context of solar mini-grid businesses. Most companies, regardless of their sector, thrive on a steady and predictable demand. In the energy sector, this predictability is vital for ensuring a consistent supply. In the ABC model, mini-grid developers prioritize serving commercial and industrial customers with substantial and predictable electricity needs, such as mobile towers, irrigation pumps, and cold storage facilities. The excess capacity generated is then used to provide electricity to small residential consumers. This strategy enhances the utilization rate of mini-grids, reduces risks, and bolsters developer profits. These stable loads are known as ‘anchor loads' and are the foundation of the ABC model.
For instance, in Haiti, after the devastating 2010 earthquake, micro-grids were proposed as a solution to electrify remote villages. An anchor load, in this case, a telecom tower, shouldered the majority of the installation costs. EarthSpark established a microgrid in the village of Les Anglais based on this anchor load in 2012. By 2013, it was powering a school, small local businesses, and a community of 54 residents. ZeroBase expanded this microgrid in 2014 to a 100 kW hybrid mini-grid, which now serves 430 households, the local market, small agricultural processing units, and other businesses. Customers prepay for their electricity, gaining access to clean, affordable, and dependable power. Additionally, the mini-grid serves as a training ground for Haitian students and technicians, enhancing their skills in rural electrification and microgrid maintenance.
Historically, electrification relied on grid extension, which demands substantial time and resources. In Sub-Saharan Africa, grid expansion projects took an average of six years to complete and cost nearly $100 million. However, the grid does not guarantee resilient, sustainable, or reliable electricity supply, leading to the use of stand-alone generators powered by fossil fuels. For example, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, and Zambia rely on hydropower, which is susceptible to seasonal variations and declining water levels due to climate change.
As solar energy becomes the most cost-effective form of energy generation in many countries, with clear climate, energy, and economic benefits, its acceptance and political support are growing. To enhance resilience and sustainability, strategies that incorporate a diverse energy mix, combining centralized and distributed renewable generation, are most effective, especially in underserved nations.
In India, approximately 700 solar mini-grids are owned and operated by private companies. These carbon-free mini-grids essentially function as community projects, improving the quality of life in various regions. Effective community involvement, starting from project conception, customization based on community input, and engagement of local workers, is crucial, as is ongoing system maintenance. Underserved areas often encounter challenges in maintaining solar/electricity infrastructure, chiefly because of unskilled manpower. These seriously hinder the reliable supply of electricity and the development of sustainable energy systems on these islands. Training local residents, involving the community, and building capacity for system maintenance are essential. If a grid has been installed, institutions and communities must ensure a maintenance budget and trained staff are available. Relying on external experts is costly and short-term.
Mini-grids are particularly valuable for settlements located more than 10-15 km away from existing power grids, depending on population size and density. Solar-based mini-grid projects can secure funding through a combination of grants, government assistance, and private-sector investments. Stand-alone solutions often require grant-driven initiatives to deploy in areas with limited financial capabilities among consumers.
When the main grid reaches a remote location, there are several models for integrating mini-grids with it. Until the early 1990s, the main grid couldn't reach rural areas in Cambodia. Consequently, local entrepreneurs invested in and operated hundreds of diesel-powered mini-grids without government support. However, when the national utility, Electricite du Cambodge (EdC), extended the main grid to these rural areas, the electricity landscape underwent a significant transformation. The Electricity Authority of Cambodia (EAC) required mini-grid operators to obtain ‘distribution licenses' and, in return, allowed them to operate at higher tariffs. Isolated mini-grids were also permitted to become ‘small-power distributors (SPDs),' enabling them to purchase electricity from EdC or neighboring countries at lower costs than diesel generation. The EAC provided technical assistance on the installation and operation of mini-grids, improving distribution network quality for future grid connectivity. Currently, more than 250 formerly isolated mini-grids are connected to the national grid as SPDs, benefiting over 1 million consumers. The government later intervened to establish uniform tariffs for all SPDs nationwide and introduced subsidies to bridge the gap between the retail tariff and the higher operational costs of SPDs.
In order to expand the deployment of mini-grids for electricity access, especially in less developed countries and with a focus on private sector investment, several crucial facilitating elements must be established. These encompass the need for favorable policies and regulations, access to affordable financial resources, training and skill-building in technical aspects, ensuring the quality and standardization of equipment, and the availability of reliable data. When initiating electricity access projects in various countries, it's vital to acknowledge the unique challenges presented by each location and to tailor the approach accordingly. Thus, for widespread adoption of solar mini-grids, it becomes imperative to conduct specific assessments for individual countries. These assessments should scrutinize the existing conditions, suggest pertinent modifications and additions, and devise strategies for execution while considering the prevailing policy and regulatory framework.
If the 660 million people who are likely to be left without electricity by 2030 are to be served, solar is the solution we have. Combined with battery storage, solar energy's affordability, its technical maturity, easy adaptability, bankability combined with its ability to have a multiplier effect on job creation make it an essential solution in achieving universal energy access.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/12/agrivoltaic-facilities-with-single-axis-trackers-have-lower-lcoe-than-those-with-fixed-structures/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BELGIUM,EUROPE,WESTERN EUROPE",LIOR KAHANA,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2023",Agrivoltaic facilities with single-axis trackers have lower LCOE than those with fixed structures,"The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for agrivoltaic bifacial systems based on single-axis trackers is 23% lower than that of agrivoltaic bifacial facilities built on fixed structures, a new study from KU Leuven in Belgium has shown.
“Our cost estimations for this pilot study, revealed similar expenses for both fixed and tracked systems,” the research's lead author, Brecht Willockx told pv magazine. “However, due to the significantly higher specific yield (kWh/kW), the solar tracker exhibited a lower LCOE.”
The researchers conducted a comprehensive comparison between the two system configurations at a testing field located in Grembergen, Belgium, with both systems using the pile drilling technique for their foundations.
The system with the fixed structures was deployed with a row-to-row distance of 9 m to maintain appropriate spacing for crop growth and accessibility. The solar modules have each a nominal power of 455 W and are placed at a maximum height of 2.6 m to minimize any visual impact.
As for the system relying on trackers, the same module types were placed at a height of 2.3 m. “To enhance bifacial gain, the structural elements at the backside are minimized by increasing the gap between the torque tube and module (50 cm) and ensuring longitudinal module spacing (1 cm),” the scientists explained.

Through their analysis, the academics found that the facility based on trackers outperformed the fixed structure setup in energy yield, resulting in approximately a 35% increase in monthly electricity production. Furthermore, the system using tracking showed improved results in land use efficiency, which takes into account both electrical and agricultural yields.
The Belgian group found that, in the rain-fed 2021 season, the tracking system has achieved 15% more total yield. In the same season, the fixed system achieved a 5% lower yield, meaning it was no better than separate production sites. In the dry 2022 season, the tracked system displayed a 47% increase in total yield and the fixed one an increase of 21%, compared to the reference point.
Throughout the rainy growing season of 2021, a smart tracking algorithm, taking into account a trade-off between energy yield and crop yield, was employed, while in the hot and dry season of 2022, the system switched to a traditional full energy tracking algorithm, taking into account only energy yield.
The LCOE for the fixed system constructed by the researchers was found to be €0.10/kWh ($0.107/kWh), while the system with tracking algorithm was €0.077/kWh.
According to the research, those prices hike a bit when considering the crop yield losses that are due to the installation of the PV systems on the field. An additional €0.02/kWh is to be added to the LCOE of the tracked system therefore, while a €0.035/kWh is to be added in the case of the fixed system.
“We believe that the best business model for farmers, investors, and off-takers are power purchase agreements (PPA) contracts, where prices of interspace agrivoltaics are in line with ground-mounted PV,” Willockx added. “However, there is still a significant premium due to the lower installed capacity per hectare and fixed costs.”
The scientists presented their findings in the paper “Performance evaluation of vertical bifacial and single-axis tracked agrivoltaic systems on arable land,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy. “Practical insights and limitations of agrivoltaic systems have been incorporated into the evaluation,” Willockx said.

KREDL plans to develop an interstate transmission grid-connected 500 MW solar park in the Bidar district of Karnataka. It is seeking a consultant to prepare a detailed project report for the development of the project.
The prospective consultant will perform a range of tasks, including site surveys, feasibility reports, solar resource assessments, energy yield estimations, plot size optimization, layout planning, infrastructure development, and the creation of a detailed project report.
The solar park falls under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy's (MNRE) initiative to establish solar/renewable energy ultra-mega parks. MNRE supports states and union territories in setting up these parks, providing essential infrastructure such as cleared land, transmission systems, water access, road connectivity, and communication networks to developers.
The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has identified the location for a 765/400/220kV Bidar pooling station in Malegaon village, Aurad taluk, to support the proposed Bidar solar park.

Silfab Solar and Norwegian ingot and wafer supplier NorSun have signed a deal for NorSun’s planned 5 GW ingot and wafer production facility in the United States.
In March Silfab Solar announced plans to invest $125 million investment to expand its facilities and launch a third cell and module fabrication facility in the United States. The company is planning 1 GW of cell production and 1.2 GW if module production, with operations to start in 2024. 
NorSun recently raised $8.5 million in new equity to further develop clean energy manufacturing projects in the United States, including a 5 GW ingot and wafer production facility.
The companies will benefit from the support of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which is stimulating a manufacturing renaissance. However, while much module manufacturing is expected in the United States, ingot wafer and cell production do not align.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the current domestic solar module capacity is 8 GW. However, more than 155 GW of solar supply chain capacity expansions have been announced since the passing of the IRA. This has resulted in an estimated $20 billion investment across domestic communities, leading to various production additions, including:
Paolo Maccario, the CEO of Silfab Solar, said that the agreement with NorSun “adds strategic value to Silfab’s unwavering commitment to supply North America with domestically produced, high-performing solar panels.”
Meanwhile, Norsun has temporarily suspended wafer production in Norway, as module oversupply in Europe is affecting pricing across the solar value chain, resulting in employee layoffs through the end of this year. The company reports that it will continue to concentrate on its short-term and long-term expansion plans, including plans to upgrade its production line in Årdal, Norway.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/12/european-solar-manufacturers-demand-eu-support/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,EUROPE",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2023",European solar manufacturers demand EU support,"SolarPower Europe and the ESMCouncil have sent letters to the EU Commission calling for quick measures to preserve the solar industry in Europe and protect it from a second wave of insolvencies.
In recent months, module prices, have dropped more than 25%, hitting a record low of under €0.15/W for low-cost products. This break in the pre-pandemic price threshold is causing significant challenges, especially for European PV manufacturers. SolarPower Europe has cautioned in a letter to the European Commission that these record-low import prices for photovoltaics could jeopardize the EU's open strategic autonomy goals.
“While price drops are typically welcome news, if unchecked they have serious repercussions for our open strategic autonomy,” said Walburga Hemetsberger, the chair of SolarPower Europe. “In the short term, this is already posing real challenges to domestic competitiveness and the rebirth of EU solar manufacturing. We’re urgently calling on EU leaders to save Europe’s strategic tech supply lines.”
The association attributes the current situation to a “perfect storm” of market forces, with strong global demand and intense competition among Chinese photovoltaic suppliers leading to increased investments along the supply chains. Currently, there is approximately 600 GW of worldwide production capacity. This oversupply has resulted in a rapid decline in prices for raw materials like silicon and throughout the module, inverter, and battery supply chain, according to Solarpower Europe. Consequently, European manufacturers are struggling to sell their products, raising the risk of insolvencies, exemplified by the recent bankruptcy of Norwegian ingot manufacturer Norwegian Crystals.
ESMC's survey of 15 European photovoltaic manufacturers found that solar module production dropped from 9 GW to 1 GW year on year by the end of August. SolarPower Europe said that manufacturers face additional challenges due to a temporary slowdown in the European photovoltaics market in the third quarter, influenced by inflation and increasing bottlenecks in network connections and project approvals.
To address these issues, SolarPower Europe has called on the EU Commission to swiftly support the solar industry. Specific measures include the emergency purchase of module stocks from European photovoltaic manufacturers and the establishment of an EU-level bank for photovoltaic manufacturers to address shortcomings in state aid under the Temporary Transition and Crisis Framework (TCTF).
The association also advocates for the adoption of the Net Zero Industry Act, incorporating strict sustainability and resilience criteria in specific auctions. It also supports the EU Forced Labor Regulation's intended impact through the Solar Stewardship Initiative (SSI). SolarPower Europe encourages cooperation between EU member states' funding programs and seeks to boost photovoltaic demand in Europe, potentially through the European directive on overall building efficiency, to counterbalance the oversupply.
“This is a rare second chance. Europe’s original solar manufacturing base was lost a decade ago,” warned Hemetsberger. “If we don’t respond rapidly and appropriately to this price crisis, we’re looking at another wave of bankruptcies, and a false start for EU's open strategic autonomy agenda.”
In the September issue of pv magazine, we examine booming solar markets in Brazil and Mexico; investigate whether TOPCon modules really are more susceptible to degradation than PERC products; attempt to unravel how US solar manufacturers can qualify for domestic content bonuses under the Inflation Reduction Act; and look at how homeowners can achieve the residential solar, battery, and EV dream.
The ESMC noted the critical situation for manufacturers and called for swift support from the EU Commission, including options such as the TCTF framework, the Net Zero Industry Act, and stringent measures against products tied to forced labor. The call has been endorsed by approximately 40 manufacturers across the PV value chain, as well as by organizations ESMC, PV Thin, and ISC Konstanz.
The ESMC predicts around 120 GW of solar module imports in Europe this year, effectively doubling demand on the continent. The association highlights the dilemma facing European manufacturers: Persist with closed production and the risk of bankruptcy or seek refuge in regions like the United States, where the PV industry enjoys support such as the Investment Tax Credit (IRA).
