“Longi has a very clear view that in the next five to six years, back-contact cells will be the mainstream of crystalline silicon cells,” he said. “The high conversion efficiency of BC cells is the crown jewel of crystalline silicon technology, and the whole industry is ready now to pick this jewel.”
Longi plans to achieve a total solar cell production capacity of 110 GW by the end of 2023, with 30 GW dedicated to TOPCon technology and 80 GW for BC technology.
Baoshen stated a preference for BC cells over TOPCon devices, on claims that TOPCon cell technology is transitional and offers minimal efficiency improvements compared to past PERC technology advancements.
Additionally, BC technology can be combined with p-type wafers, for which Longi has substantial production capacities, giving it an advantage over the more common interdigitated back-contact (IBC) technology.
“The back-contact (BC) cell technology improves photoelectric conversion efficiency by shifting all the electrode grids on the front side to the back side of the cell, thus reducing the shading of the grids from sunlight.” Shen Wenzhong, secretary general of the Shanghai Solar Energy Association and Director of the Solar Energy Research Institute at Shanghai Jiaotong University, told pv magazine. “As a cell structure, BC technology can be combined with a variety of cell technologies to form back-contact based solar cells.”
In March, Longi launched its own hybrid passivated back contact (HPBC) tech. The company has yet to explain exactly what HPBC is, but it is believed to be an extension of p-type (positively doped silicon) IBC technology that combines the structural advantages of PERC, TOPCon, and IBC solar.
Longi will develop “P-IBC” cells using its extensive production capacity of p-type wafers, along with a silicon dioxide tunneling layer, polysilicon film, and upgraded laser equipment, low-pressure chemical vapor deposition, and coating-cleaning equipment—all derived from PERC-process lines.

US International Development Finance Corp. (DFC) has approved up to $425 million to finance Tata Power’s new greenfield 4.3 GW solar cell and module manufacturing plant in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. 
Tata Power is one of India’s largest integrated power companies. Its step-down subsidiary, TP Solar, is setting up the 4.3 GW solar factory in Tirunelveli district. The facility is expected to start PV module production by the end of the year, with cell production to start in the first quarter of 2024.
“The Tirunelveli manufacturing plant will integrate advanced technologies enabling the production of high-wattage solar modules and cells with industry-leading efficiencies. Additionally, the facility will implement industry 4.0 standards for smart manufacturing,” said Tata Power. “The plant is expected to create over 2,000 employment opportunities directly or indirectly, with the majority of the employees being women from the local areas.”
Tata Power has committed to expanding its clean and green energy capacity from 38% to 70% by 2030. The company is actively focusing on renewable capacity expansion and transitioning into a consumer-oriented business.
Currently, Tata Power’s renewable portfolio stands at approx. 7.8 GW, with 4.1 GW operational and 3.6 GW under implementation. The company already has an operating solar cell and module manufacturing capacity of 500 MW per year.

This measure is intended to improve the grid congestion issues that have been threatening the deployment of additional renewable energy capacity over the last three years and has forced all operators to take measures and seek creative solutions to reduce the grid's burden.
The RTI has to be compliant with the International Electrotechnical Commission 61850 standard, which defines communication protocols for intelligent electronic devices at electrical substations. The requirement is in line with the framework established by the European Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/631.
One of the first Dutch vendors with a stand-alone RTI solution for PV plant operators is Withthegrid. Its Teleport product has been approved in lab tests by Norwegian classification society DNV on behalf of Netbeheer Nederland, the Dutch association of national-regional electricity and gas network operators. It is now being validated in the field by the three main grid operators, according to Paul Mignot, CEO, Withthegrid.
The Teleport is compatible with a number of brand-name inverters. It can also be connected to a battery system, wind turbines, and metering equipment. It uses standard data communications cabling, such as RS232, RS485, or Ethernet cables. It includes relevant protocols, such as Modbus, Open Charge Point Protocol, and SunSpec, which are used in inverters, electric vehicle chargers, and battery systems. It comes equipped with European-grade security and encryption, including no inbound communication channels.
The device sits between the endpoint of the distribution system operator (DSO) and the central PV inverter. It receives grid congestion signals from the DSO endpoint to limit power production, or balancing market signals from the transmission system operator (TSO), and it can then send commands, such as “limit production power” to the central inverter in a PV plant based on the owners' parameter settings.
From the grid perspective, it contributes to a balanced grid and greater safety of infrastructure. For plant operators, it makes it possible to ramp up and ramp down production within seconds, according to Mignot.  “This kind of flexibility on the part of the asset owner avoids waste and financial losses,” Mignot told pv magazine.
Siemens has an RTI-compliant product that has similarly been approved for field trials, according to the website of Netbeheer Nederland.
The Netherlands urgently needs to address grid constraints, as high volumes of solar capacity will be deployed in the years ahead. Over the past two years, Liander has implemented a number of measures to increase grid capacity in several areas facing grid constraints, as such bottlenecks are preventing more renewables from going online. These measures include the deployment of two giant transformers and congestion management for grid bottlenecks.
Tennet also recently developed an interactive online map showing the locations in the country where the power grid is most congested.
Dutch power and gas supplier Liander recently revealed this week that residential PV system owners experienced three times as many curtailment events in the first half of 2023 than they did in the same period last year in the provinces of Gelderland, Noord-Holland, Flevoland, Friesland, and Zuid-Holland.
As of June 2022, the Netherlands had a cumulative installed PV capacity of 16.5 GW, with 3,803 MW installed in 2021 and 3,882 MW installed in 2022, according to CBS, the nation's statistics agency.

“We will buy power from these facilities under 20-year contracts,” BJMC Chairman Anis Mahmud told pv magazine.
The project developers were selected through a competitive tender that included six foreign bidders and their local joint venture partners, he noted.
 “We have sent their proposals to the power division for evaluation and award the contact,” Mahmud added, without providing additional details.
Chint Solar Bangladesh (China), Solarion CNI Creative Centre (Indonesia), Copenhagen Urban Solar Parks BD Consortium (Denmark), Top Points Trading (Oman), Lesso Consortium (Singapore), and BAY Trina Consortium (China) are the bidders.
In June, the government of Bangladesh implemented measures to increase the share of domestic independent power producers (IPPs) in the renewable energy market. It agreed to allow them to hold 100% stakes in companies that own renewable energy projects, removing the old 80% foreign investment limit.
Previously, domestic IPPs were also permitted to participate in projects through international consortia with 51% shares, while foreign developers were limited to maximum shares of 20%.

PV-powered water pumps are mainly used in agricultural irrigation, in locations where power transportation is expensive or unavailable. They often use induction motors due to their small form factor, robustness, and high efficiency. However, according to the researchers, controlling induction motors in order to produce constant torque is challenging, as they involve nonlinear dynamics and unknown load inputs, as well as time-varying mechanical and electrical parameters.
The scientists explained that their new adaptive power control (APC) technique has a structure that enables the water pump to work with high performance and efficiency at every operating point, with the algorithm being able to accurately determine the maximum power point of the PV system and the rotor speed of an induction motor under varying atmospheric conditions.
“By employing a single irradiance sensor and eliminating the need for a speed sensor, the method becomes more cost-effective and practical,” they stated. “The proposed sensorless maximum power point tracker (MPPT) method successfully tracks the maximum power points of the PV system and efficiently transfers the variable power produced by the PV system to the pump.”
In order to to calculate the real speed of the motor without the speed sensor, the new method also uses the Extended Kalman–Bucy filter, which is commonly used for estimating state vectors of objects in track. “The Extended Kalman–Bucy filter was selected due to its reputation as the most effective and systematic state and parameter estimator in the literature,” the academics said. “The filter’s ability to be easily applied to a known system’s state space model, its capability for parameter estimation, and most importantly, its noise filtering ability are the reasons for choosing this algorithm.”
Through a simulation, the group tested the effectiveness of the algorithm on a water pumping system based a 1.2 kW PV array and a 1.1 kW induction motor. It found that the motor successfully follows the reference speed generated by the APC.
“The developed adaptive method not only improves the overall efficiency of the photovoltaic water pump system but also contributes to the sustainability and feasibility of renewable energy applications,” the scientists concluded. “By reducing the reliance on additional sensors and control hardware, the proposed method provides a cost-effective solution for harnessing solar energy in water pumping applications.”
They presented the algorithm in the paper “Speed sensorless Adaptive Power Control for photovoltaic-fed water pump using Extended Kalman–Bucy filter,” published in energy reports. The researchers come from the Batman University and the Firat University in Turkey.
Looking forward, they suggested suggested further testing the novel controller in a larger-scale PV-powered water pump system, along with its combination with different energy storage techniques.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/11/how-to-build-finance-product-stewardship-scheme-for-photovoltaic-panels/,"MARKETS,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 11, 2023","How to build, finance product stewardship scheme for photovoltaic panels","A research group in Australia has defined a series of recommendations for the design of a product stewardship scheme for solar photovoltaic panels and its financial support. Product stewardship consists of a series of actions aimed at preventing waste during the design and manufacturing of a process in an effort to minimize the health, environmental, and social impacts of a product.
“Our work presents a comprehensive product stewardship scheme for solar PV panels, which is, as far as I know, the first one published,” the research's lead author, Peter Majewski, told pv magazine. “It covers new and legacy panels and provides a solution for covering costs.”
In the study “Product stewardship scheme for solar photovoltaic panels,” published in Current Opinion in Green and Sustainable Chemistry, Majewski and his colleagues explained that a well-designed stewardship scheme should define unequivocally which are the responsibilities of the industry and which are those of consumers in regard to the end-of-life management of a given product.
They also said that, as a rule of thumb, landfill bans, tracking of the panels' serial numbers, and a clear definition of ownership should always be included in the legislation for end-of-life solar products. Furthermore, they said that a Product Stewardship Organisation (PSO) should report to the government on the results and effectiveness of the scheme.
“Once the panels are installed on a rooftop of private dwellings, their operator is obviously the owner of the dwelling,” they explained. “However, once the panels are dismantled and on their way to a recycler, ownership and responsibilities for the proper handling of the panels needs to be clarified. In case of commercially used solar PV panels of solar farms, it can be expected that business agreements between panel manufacturers and solar farm operators clarify the ownership and end-of-life arrangement for the panels before solar farm gets planning approval.”
The scientists created a workflow diagram showing the flow of panels from retail to the customer and to the recycler. The upper part shows how panels may be recycled or re-used as second-hand products, while the lower part shows the B2B arrangement between manufacturers and PV system owners.

The Australian group also explained that all new legislation for end-of-life panels should also apply to modules that are already in operation, considering both their recycling and re-use, and should also avoid calculating recovery rates in terms of weight, as this system may encourage the recycling of “heavy” components only.
As for the re-use of the panels, the academics warned that these should be linked to an electric compliance certificate provided by a certified electrician, which would ensure their safe operation. “Consumers of second-hand solar PV panels need to be certain that the second-hand panels are still working at a defined capacity,” they stated. “Therefore, a certificate would be necessary that provides information about the capacity and age of the second-hand panel.”
The Australian team also sought to define the level of the levy needed to put the scheme in place and said it should be continuously adjustable to ensure high collection and recycling rates. “A fully funded not for profit PSO, which is overseeing and managing the product stewardship scheme, usually achieves high collection rates,” they emphasized. “It can, therefore, be recommended, that the levy is set at a level which not only allows to support collection and recycling of the panels, but also provides funds to support the operations of an effective PSO.”
As a final warning, the researchers said that any legislation for PV module recycling and re-use should be in place before significant amounts of solar waste are generated.
The research group comprises scientists from the University of South Australia, the University of New South Wales (UNSW), US-based PV module recycling company Solarcycle Inc., USA, and Australian association Circular PV Alliance (CPVA).

Residential solar and storage marketplace and informational site EnergySage has released its market intelligence report for June 2022 to July 2023, highlighting a shifting market under raised interest rates. The report tracks millions of data points based on homeowner shopping transactions in its marketplace.
Reported solar prices have now climbed for two years consecutively, though more gradually in the first half of 2023. EnergySage said its average solar quote was $2.90 per W, up 1.8% in the first half of 2023. The company said that early Q3 data shows that solar prices have begun to cool off, decreasing about 3.5% so far in-quarter. Prices bottomed out in the first half of 2021 at $2.67 per Watt.
Energy storage prices also increased 1% in the first half of 2023. Over 50% of solar quotes on EnergySage included a battery, a trend that continues to rise steadily. Storage in the first half of 2023 averaged $1,352 per kWh, with batteries often sized as 10 kWh in major markets.
Headwinds have hit the residential solar sector hard this year, with major public companies in the space like Sunrun, Enphase, and SolarEdge down 50% or more in 2023. Rising interest rates and sharp cuts to compensation for exporting solar, or net energy metering, have put a damper on installation rates.
“While the first half of 2023 was tumultuous at times for the solar and storage industries in the U.S., we remain optimistic: solar and storage have proven to be resilient in the past, surviving–and even excelling–irrespective of expiring tax credits and incentives, changing net metering policies, shifting tariffs, supply chain issues, and labor shortages,” said Vikram Aggarwal, chief executive officer and founder, EnergySage.
EnergySage said typical loan offerings have shifted from 2.99% interest rates in the second half of 2022 to 4.99% interest rates for a 25-year loan in the first half 2023. This leads to an average monthly cost of $30 more for a $30,000 loan.
For products, EnergySage’s most-commonly quoted solar panels were Qcells, while Enphase was the highest-quoted provider for both energy storage and inverters. Breaking into the top ten most-quoted list or gaining in significant market share were Waaree solar panels and FranklinWH batteries.
The average estimated payback period for residential solar is 8.3 years, averaging 10.4 kW. This has improved slightly from the average breakeven return on investment of 8.7 years. A typical solar array can produce local, predictable-cost, and clean energy for 20 to 30 years or more.
The five largest markets for solar averaged lower quoted prices when compared with the national median. California averaged $2.89/W, Texas $2.59/W, Florida $2.45/W, New York $3.30/W, Nevada $2.55/W.
California was the only top-ten market to have price increases on a median per W basis in the first half of 2023. California also had the nation’s smallest average quoted system size at 8.05 kW, while the median was 10.4 kW, and Arkansas had the largest median system size at 14.88 kW.
Over time, quoted panel power ratings have increased on the EnergySage market. Nine out of ten quotes in the first half 2023 included 390 W or larger panels. In the first half of 2020, nearly half the quotes on the marketplace were 330 W or less.
The report noted a steep uptick in consumers showing interest in storage in order to self-supply solar generation, suggesting that lowered net metering rates are discouraging the export of local, clean electricity. Nearly 40% of consumers reported self-supply as a reason for getting a storage quote, up from less than 20% in 2022. Backup power for outages and savings on utility rates were also listed as top reasons for including energy storage in a quote.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/11/how-long-do-residential-solar-panels-last/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 11, 2023",How long do residential solar panels last?,"Residential solar panels are often sold with long-term loans or leases, with homeowners entering contracts of 20 years or more. But how long do panels last, and how resilient are they?
Panel life depends on several factors, including climate, module type, and the racking system used, among others. While there isn’t a specific “end date” for a panel per se, loss of production over time often forces equipment retirements.
When deciding whether to keep your panel running 20-30 years in the future, or to look for an upgrade at that time, monitoring output levels is the best way to make an informed decision.
Degradation
The loss of output over time, called degradation, typically lands at about 0.5% each year, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
Manufacturers typically consider 25 to 30 years a point at which enough degradation has occurred where it may be time to consider replacing a panel. The industry standard for manufacturing warranties is 25 years on a solar module, said NREL.
Given the 0.5% benchmark annual degradation rate, a 20-year-old panel is capable of producing about 90% of its original capability.

Panel quality can make some impact on degradation rates. NREL reports premium manufacturers like Panasonic and LG have rates of about 0.3% per year, while some brands degrade at rates as high as 0.80%. After 25 years, these premium panels could still produce 93% of their original output, and the higher-degradation example could produce 82.5%.
(Read: “Researchers assess degradation in PV systems older than 15 years“)

A sizeable portion of degradation is attributed to a phenomenon called potential induced degradation (PID), an issue experienced by some, but not all, panels. PID occurs when the panel’s voltage potential and leakage current drive ion mobility within the module between the semiconductor material and other elements of the module, like the glass, mount, or frame. This causes the module’s power output capacity to decline, in some cases significantly.
Some manufacturers build their panels with PID-resistant materials in their glass, encapsulation, and diffusion barriers.
All panels also suffer something called light induced degradation (LID), in which panels lose efficiency within the first hours of being exposed to the sun. LID varies from panel to panel based on the quality of the crystalline silicon wafers, but usually results in a one-time, 1-3% loss in efficiency, said testing laboratory PVEL, PV Evolution Labs.
Weathering
The exposure to weather conditions is the main driver in panel degradation. Heat is a key factor in both real-time panel performance and degradation over time. Ambient heat negatively affects the performance and efficiency of electrical components, according to NREL.
By checking the manufacturer’s data sheet, a panel’s temperature coefficient can be found, which will demonstrate the panel’s ability to perform in higher temperatures.

The coefficient explains how much real-time efficiency is lost by each degree of Celsius increased above the standard temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. For example, a temperature coefficient of -0.353% means that for every degree Celsius above 25, 0.353% of total production capability is lost.
Heat exchange drives panel degradation through a process called thermal cycling. When it is warm, materials expand, and when the temperature lowers, they contract. This movement slowly causes microcracks to form in the panel over time, lowering output.
In its annual Module Score Card study, PVEL analyzed 36 operational solar projects in India, and found significant impacts from heat degradation. The average annual degradation of the projects landed at 1.47%, but arrays located in colder, mountainous regions degraded at nearly half that rate, at 0.7%.

Proper installation can help deal with heat related issues. Panels should be installed a few inches above the roof, so that convective air can flow beneath and cool the equipment. Light-colored materials can be used in panel construction to limit heat absorption. And components like inverters and combiners, whose performance is particularly sensitive to heat, should be located in shaded areas, suggested CED Greentech.
Wind is another weather condition that can cause some harm to solar panels. Strong wind can cause flexing of the panels, called dynamic mechanical load. This also causes microcracks in the panels, lowering output. Some racking solutions are optimized for high-wind areas, protecting the panels from strong uplift forces and limiting microcracking. Typically, the manufacturer’s datasheet will provide information on the max winds the panel is able to withstand.
The same goes for snow, which can cover panels during heavier storms, limiting output. Snow can also cause a dynamic mechanical load, degrading the panels. Typically, snow will slide off of panels, as they are slick and run warm, but in some cases a homeowner may decide to clear the snow off the panels. This must be done carefully, as scratching the glass surface of the panel would make a negative impact on output.
(Read: “Tips for keeping your rooftop solar system humming over the long term“)
Degradation is a normal, unavoidable part of a panel’s life. Proper installation, careful snow clearing, and careful panel cleaning can help with output, but ultimately, a solar panel is a technology with no moving parts, requiring very little maintenance.
Standards
To ensure a given panel is likely to live a long life and operate as planned, it must undergo standards testing for certification. Panels are subject to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) testing, which apply to both mono- and polycrystalline panels.
EnergySage said panels that achieve IEC 61215 standard are tested for electrical characteristics like wet leakage currents, and insulation resistance. They under go a mechanical load test for both wind and snow, and climate tests that check for weaknesses to hot spots, UV exposure, humidity-freeze, damp heat, hail impact, and other outdoor exposure.

IEC 61215 also determines a panel’s performance metrics at standard test conditions, including temperature coefficient, open-circuit voltage, and maximum power output.
Also commonly seen on a panel spec sheet is the seal of Underwriters Laboratories (UL), which also provides standards and testing. UL runs climactic and aging tests, as well as the full gamut of safety tests.
Failures
Solar panel failure happens at a low rate. NREL conducted a study of over 50,000 systems installed in the United States and 4,500 globally between the years of 2000 and 2015. The study found a median failure rate of 5 panels out of 10,000 annually.

Panel failure has improved markedly over time, as it was found that system installed between 1980 and 2000 demonstrated a failure rate double the post-2000 group.

System downtime is rarely attributed to panel failure. In fact, a study by kWh Analytics found that 80% of all solar plant downtime is a result of failing inverters, the device that converts the panel’s DC current to usable AC. pv magazine will analyze inverter performance in the next installment of this series.
