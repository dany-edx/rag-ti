The Danish Energy Agency has rejected Plug Power’s bid for the first Power-to-X tender in Danish history due to the US company's failure to meet contractual obligations to provide a bank guarantee. “This means that Plug Power is no longer among the winners of the PtX tender,” said the Danish Energy Agency. The other winners are still European Energy/Vindtestcenter Måde K/S, European Energy/Padborg PtX ApS, Electrochaea/Biocat Roslev, and European Energy/Kassø PtX Expansion ApS. The four winning projects have still been awarded their entire tender. “The Danish Energy Agency does not believe that the new decision will affect when contracts will be signed with the winners, just as it is not expected to affect the time horizon for when the plants will be ready,” the agency said. The total budget of the tender, announced in April, is DKK 1.32 billion ($190 million) in 2023 prices.  
As a result, Danish authorities announced increased public support for the marginal winner of the Danish Power-to-X tender, Everfuel and Hy24 A/S JV. “The increased offer has a value of DKK 211 million ($30,9 million),” said Everfuel in an emailed note, explaining that the Danish Power-to-X tender’s built-in subsidy is computed per kilogram of green hydrogen produced. The subsidy will run for ten years. “The JV will provide further information if it decides to accept the support offer,” said Everfuel. The marginal bidder still cannot be offered the full bid, being offered only the remaining amount of the total budget. 
Masdar has partnered with Emirates Steel Arkan to develop a green hydrogen project to decarbonize the steel sector in the United Arab Emirates. “The pilot project is the first-of-its-kind in the Middle East and North African region,” said Masdar. “Located in the Emirates Steel Arkan production facilities at the Industrial City of Abu Dhabi, the project is currently in the installation phase.” The companies plan to commission the facility in early 2024. Abu Dhabi-based Masdar will have a strong presence at COP28 in Expo City, Dubai.
Airbus’ Blue Condor has made its first hydrogen-powered flight over the US state of Nevada. The flight was the company’s first to use hydrogen as the sole fuel source, and it kicked off a test campaign that will conclude in a contrail-measuring mission in early 2024. Airbus said it will monitor the composition of the hydrogen contrails of the modified glider to investigate the environmental impact of hydrogen aviation.

Replacing the conductors on existing transmission lines can rapidly increase transmission capacity and “unlock” renewable energy at lower cost than building transmission in new rights-of-way, found a study from the Energy Institute at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business.
Advanced conductors can carry twice as much power as conventional conductors, the study says. With reconductoring, existing transmission lines are replaced with reconductored lines that are strung along existing transmission towers in existing rights of way, with upgraded terminal equipment as needed, as shown in the bottom portion of the image.
By avoiding the need for new rights-of-way, reconductoring avoids time-consuming and costly processes for land acquisition and permitting. Reconductoring can meet over 80% of the transmission needed to reach 90% clean power by 2035, the authors found.
With reconductoring at scale, solar, wind and storage projects near the existing transmission network could be interconnected more easily. The study includes several maps of specific sites with “cost-effective, high-quality” renewable resources located near the existing transmission network, obtained from the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDs) model.
Researchers from UC Berkeley and the consultancy GridLab used the ReEDS model to conduct the study. Under their base case with high electrification and allowing reconductoring, co-optimizing generation and transmission expansion would lower wholesale electricity costs by 3-4%, compared to not allowing reconductoring. By 2050, system cost savings from large-scale reconductoring would total $180 billion.
In both of the two scenarios modeled, which considered restricted or unrestricted transmission buildout, reconductored capacity accounted for the majority of capacity installed before 2030. The authors say reconductoring presents an opportunity for expanding transmission capacity in the next few years while new transmission lines are planned and permitted.
The study projected that the optimal added transmission capacity by 2050, allowing for reconductoring, would be about 90,000 GW-miles with restricted buildout or about 190,000 GW-miles with unrestricted buildout. The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that 54,500 GW-miles of additional within-region transmission capacity are needed for a clean grid.
The study says that previous work “has established that it is cost-effective and time-efficient” to expand transmission capacity by reconductoring existing lines, and there is “robust global deployment” of advanced conductors, yet the technology has seen “only limited uptake” in the US. A study appendix describes reconductoring deployments in five countries and in Texas.
To “spur uptake” of reconductoring, the authors proposed policy measures that could be undertaken by:
The study is titled “Accelerating transmission expansion by using advanced conductors in existing right-of-way.” The authors say they plan to investigate the potential for large-scale reconductoring in other global regions.

The systems feature lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP) batteries from Chinese battery giant CATL, with a rated power output of 100 kW.
“With just one Tianwu unit, you can get a complete all-in-one battery energy storage system including power conversion system (PCS), battery, battery management system (BMS), and energy management system (EMS),” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “You can also expand your capacity by connecting up to 10 units in parallel.”
The manufacturer said the battery uses air cooling and liquid cooling, and claimed that the temperature deviation of battery cells is maintained within a 3 C range. The battery's specifications include a rated voltage of 832 V, a maximum output power of 110 kW, and an IP54 protection level.

El Niño events, which see much warmer waters in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, tend to cause an extended subtropical Pacific jet stream, leading to increased cloud across the southern and central United States.
Source: NOAA
As a result of these atmospheric changes, during El Niño winters large areas of the continental US have a tendency to experience reduced irradiance. California, the Southwest, Midwest, Southeast, and Mexico in particular see cloudier conditions compared to average. Conversely, large areas of the Pacific Northwest and Canada tend to receive above-average irradiance.

This November, weather patterns have started to resemble the characteristic El Niño signature, with low pressure in the northwest Pacific, and an enhanced subtropical jet stream spreading from the Pacific across the southern United States.

This weekend, we are seeing the beginnings of this El Niño type pattern in the Jet Stream, with an enhanced subtropical jet stream across the south and southeast of the continent.
Source: NOAA
This weekend’s enhanced jet stream is sweeping high cloud from Mexico across the South of the US. As the jet stream accelerates, the atmosphere becomes unstable, causing low pressure to build up cloud over the Rockies and Midwest regions.

Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with a typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.

This is the conclusion of a recent study conducted by a group of researchers from the University of Freiburg and the University of Münster in Germany, in which its authors analyzed the repercussions of the war on the public debate in their home country.
“This was a particular historic moment, and I do not see a reason why this dynamic should continue or become a regular cycle,” the research's corresponding author, Thilo Wiertz, told pv magazine. “What seems clear to me is that Germany will not get back to the time of cheap natural gas. Germany is building large capacities for importing liquid natural gas (LNG) and this helps keep prices reasonably stable.”
Wiertz acknowledged that more global crises may occur in the future, but he also sees little reason to assume a regular pattern. He believes LNG will remain more expensive than past pipeline imports from Russia and will be in conflict with political commitments to reduce emissions. “At the same time, costs for producing renewable energy will remain low, particularly internationally,” he said.
According to Wiertz, the crisis experience has raised political and public awareness of the vulnerabilities resulting from dependence on fossil fuel imports. Those vulnerabilities are not new, but have largely been absent from the German energy discourse in the last decades.
“Before the war against Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis, renewable energy was perceived by many as expensive and unreliable,” he stated. “Fossil fuels, in contrast, were perceived as environmentally problematic, but economically more robust. This picture is slowly being turned upside down: Renewable energy is now presented as a way to diversify imports, decrease dependence, and strengthen energy sovereignty.”
This view is also being supported by falling production costs for renewable energy, particularly PV, and visions for a swift ramp-up of a global hydrogen economy. “We may be entering a time where renewable energy is seen not only as environmentally friendly, but as economically and politically more reliable,” Wiertz added. “Fossil fuels, on the other hand, are increasingly considered a geopolitical risk and burden of the past. And rightly so.”
In the paper “A Turn to Geopolitics: Shifts in the German Energy Transition Discourse in Light of Russia’s War Against Ukraine,” published in Energy Research & Social Science, Wiertz and his group analyzed newspaper articles, tweets, talk shows, and parliamentary speeches published immediately after the breakout of Ukraine‘s war and found the political discourse marked a geopolitical turn in Germany's energy transition, the so-called Energiewende.
The researchers identified, in particular, four discursive shifts in the political discussion in Germany. The first one relates to the question of whether gas imports from Russia stall or favor the transition, while the second one is about a “new moral imperative” for lowering dependence on fossil fuels. The third shift is regarding the possibility of using conventional energy sources as bridging technologies, and the fourth one frames the discussion on the energy transition in terms of security, freedom, and sovereignty.
“The discursive shifts that we identified are crucial for understanding the political future of the Energiewende and German energy politics more broadly,” the researchers explained. “At the time of writing, the war continues into its second year. It is reasonable to assume that the new geopolitical rationality and the identified lines of argument will shape the energy transition in Germany in the foreseeable future—and reshuffle established ideological positions.”
The researchers expect all political parties to reconsider their position toward the Enegiewende, stressing that discourses may change rapidly if circumstances change. “While discourse analysis often focuses on how certain perspectives become hegemonic over time, in the context of crises it can help to identify shifts at an early stage,” they also asserted.

Renewable hydrogen producers can apply for support in the form of a fixed premium per kilogram of hydrogen produced. This should close the gap between the production price and the price that consumers are currently willing to pay in a market where non-renewable hydrogen production is still cheaper.
Bidders have until Feb. 8, 2024, to submit their proposals through the EU tenders and financing portal. Bids must be based on a proposed price premium per kilogram of renewable hydrogen produced, up to a ceiling price of €4 .50/kg.
Bids up to this limit, and that also meet other qualification requirements, will be ranked from lowest to highest bid price and supported in that order, until the auction budget is exhausted.
The selected projects will receive the awarded subsidy in addition to the market revenue they generate from hydrogen sales, for a maximum of 10 years. Once the projects secure their subsidy agreements, they must begin producing renewable hydrogen within five years.
To maintain an equitable environment for all projects, cumulation with other forms of aid from participating member states is not allowed. Member states can, however, finance projects that participated in the auction but weren't chosen for support from the Innovation Fund, using the Hydrogen Bank's “auctions as a service” mechanism, particularly in cases of budgetary constraints.
The pilot auction will contribute to the REPowerEU plan to decarbonize the European economy's goal of domestically producing 10 million tons of hydrogen by 2030. The commission will launch a second round in the spring.

Arbórea Intellbird – based in Salamanca, Spain – has developed Antecursor II, the world's first autonomous civil robot for inspecting large-scale solar power plants.
Operating globally with the coverage of the Starlink network, the robot relies solely on renewable energy. The 285 kg device, constructed from aerospace alloys, is already operational in Spanish solar plants.
The Antecursor II robot boasts an autonomy of more than 30 hours. Equipped with high-resolution thermographic sensors, it continuously captures thousands of facility measurements per second. These digital data undergo evaluation through Arbórea's patented AI process, a combination of hardware and software.
“It regulates its automatic movement, with centimeter precision, on a process patented by Arbórea inspired by hunting strategies of the genet, a nocturnal predator, capable of moving precisely in the dark,” said Arbórea Intellbird.
Arbórea uses the Starlink satellite network to enable real-time monitoring of its robot fleet deployed in remote photovoltaic plants through the patented “Virtual Control Tower.” This platform automatically receives real-time information on each robot's system status and alerts related to detected anomalies.
The robot serves two primary functions: autonomously monitoring photovoltaic infrastructure and conducting vegetation clearing. Unlike drones that focus on the upper part of panels, the robot simultaneously examines lower structures, identifying potential risks like clips, fuse holders, staples, or wiring. The system detects anomalies, evaluates them based on plant conditions, and promptly alerts technicians to potential failures, preventing fire risks.
The robot also features an integrated vegetation-clearing system made from aeronautical materials, ensuring efficient mulching.

The method is based on high spatiotemporal resolution weather data as well as heat pump field trial data from academic literature.
“Although several publications have modeled heat pump load, existing models either do not accurately capture hourly heat pump usage patterns or do not represent sub-national heating demand variation,” the researchers said. “Moreover, no previous study has analyzed the implications of these spatiotemporal variations for bulk power systems planning for an entire grid region.”
The academics divided Britain into 30 temperature zones and took into account hourly onshore wind and solar capacity potential. Then, in each zone, the population-weighted average of the soil and air temperatures is calculated. Based on that and the field trial data, the method then calculates the regional heating demands and coefficient of performance (COP).
Following that, they utilized PyPSA-Eur, an open model dataset of the European energy system at the transmission network level that covers the full Entso-E area. The method provides an output of the optimal bulk power system needed to meet heat pump demands, as well as the operation costs and load shedding volume.
Through all of those steps, the academic groups employed the model on the UK as a whole, in order to compare the multi-regional results to a generalized national one. The models for national and regional cases were validated on historical data from 2019, with a deviation of 0.7% in both cases.

The results of the comparison between multi-regional results and a generalized national heat pump demand were presented in the study “Data-based, high spatiotemporal resolution heat pump demand for power system planning,” published on Applied Energy. They were calculated on five scenarios, considering the two axes of UK transmission expansion and carbon reduction. Four scenarios were on the edges of the matrix, while a central scenario considered a 15% transmission expansion and 90% carbon reduction.
According to the researchers, the national temperature-based model overestimates total heating demand in southern regions of the UK by up to 26% and underestimates demand in northern regions by up to 21%. In the peak hour, the national model overestimates the electric heating demand in coastal areas by up to 51% and underestimates it inland by up to 20%, compared to the multi-regional approach.
“Under a central scenario, using a spatially uniform heating demand profile leads to a total absolute error in the spatial allocation of generation and storage of 15.1 GW (1.3%) compared to a high-resolution demand pattern based on local temperatures,” the paper emphasized. “These capacity differences are spatially concentrated in a few locations and primarily reflect the need for more battery storage capacity to meet regional heating peaks when using high spatiotemporal resolution heating demand.”
Furthermore, under the central scenario, operational costs increase by 5% when operating a system planned with national heating demand to meet multi-regional real demand. In a scenario of 0% transmission expansion and 99% carbon reduction, the cost increase will be 323%.
“Using multi-regional temperatures to model heating demand reveals significant regional differences in Britain, a medium-sized country with a temperate climate, and could have an even more substantial impact in larger countries with more variable climates,” the researchers concluded.

More than 25% of Australia’s energy generation currently falls into the three highest climate-risk categories, according to the recently released Climate Risk Index from insurer Zurich and consulting firm Mandala Partners. That figure could grow to 35% by 2050.
Solar, alongside natural gas, is far and away the most vulnerable of all the generation types, the Climate Risk Index noted. It found that for solar, 95% of dedicated sites were in one of the three highest risk categories due to susceptibility to events like storms and hail.
As Zurich APAC CEO Justin Delaney noted, “much of the focus to date has centred on the risk of the energy grid to climate change, rather than on the risk of climate change to the grid.”
But the climate is changing and unfortunately a grid based on renewable generation is vulnerable to these changes. Representatives from AON, Commonwealth Bank, Engie, Energy Estate, PCL, and Nextracker discussed the future-proofing of Australian solar farms at the October All-Energy trade show in Melbourne. There was unanimous consensus among panelists that much more attention needs to be given to future-proofing in light of growing weather risks.

The product was onboard several of the top Challenger class finalists in this year's Bridgestone World Solar Challenge.
“It was field proven in five of the top six finalist racing cars at the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge in Australia this year. They were using a variety of PV cell technologies,” Jules van Haaren, Mito Solar co-founder, told pv magazine.
For example, the Skylar film was used in the Oxford PV silicon-perovskite tandem PV panel onboard the Top Dutch Solar Racing race car. It was also paired with panels based on Maxeon Sunpower cells onboard the Belgian Innoptus Solar Team car and the Solar Team Twente entry from the Netherlands, along with Meyer Burger heterojunction modules aboard Brunel Solar Team’s entry.
“Despite the robust module encapsulation, our foil was still able to contribute to a higher power conversion efficiency,” said van Haaren.
Under standard testing on a range of cell technologies laminated with 200 mn to 400 mn encapsulants, an increase in absolute efficiency of about 1% can be achieved, according to the company. It evaluated the film with a variety of cell types achieving similar results, including multi-junction Azur Space 3G30C cells, single-junction Alta Devices thin-film cells, and the aforementioned Maxeon Sunpower cells.
Supporting angles of up to 90 degrees, Skylar purportedly reduces reflection losses, while capturing light reflected from inside the module.
It is suited for challenging irradiance conditions and mobile-integrated PV applications. But it is not suited for residential or ground-mounted applications, stressed van Haaren who explained that while the film can be modified to cope better with water and dust, it is not meant for use in residential or mainstream PV markets due to its textured surface which can potentially trap dust.
The solar racing world is where Skylar has first adopters, but it may find its next application on PV panels installed onboard drones and long-endurance aircraft operating at high altitudes. “These are applications where performance and weight really matter. With our technology they can, for example, have a higher payload,” said Van Haaren.
In addition to Skylar and waterproofing films, four-year-old Mito Solar produces a range of standard and flexible modules, typically based on Maxeon Sunpower cells, that it customizes for its transportation and leisure industry customers.

FOB China prices of Mono PERC M10 wafer increased by 0.68%, or $0.002 per piece (pc), to $0.295/pc this week, while Mono PERC G12 prices increased by 0.49%, or $0.002/pc, to $0.412/pc.
Currency fluctuations aside, the dynamics underlying China’s domestic market remained the same, leading to a continuation of the flat trend in the EXW wafer prices in the China domestic market for the second week running. The prices of Mono PERC M10 and G12 wafers remained stable at about CNY2.38 ($0.33)/pc and CNY3.32/pc, respectively.

Recently, low operating rates resulted in greater manufacturing costs for wafer producers, according to an integrated manufacturer. Now that wafer inventories have somewhat dropped, wafer makers are keen to increase their operating rates, the source continued.
There have been recent talks about wafer producers raising their operating rates and buying polysilicon at a faster rate due to the industry-wide sentiment that the price of polysilicon is about to bottom out. However, OPIS learnt from its market survey that the operating rates at wafer companies did not significantly grow, as production costs would decrease but losses would accumulate with unsold wafers.
According to a cell supplier, the consumption of inventories of good-quality wafers has slowed as some cell producers have been buying wafers of reduced quality. This may resonate with a few downstream users who have been worried about the impact that this cost war may have on module quality for 2024.
There are no profitable wafer companies currently, and some small-size wafer factories in China have closed, according to a market observer. Some wafer businesses are looking for chances to establish manufacturing facilities overseas in order to survive, the source continued.
Another source from upstream concurred, stating that wafer manufacturers would find it challenging to turn a profit in the near future. As a result, this source does not anticipate a notable increase in the operating rates of wafer companies, since more production entails higher losses.
Looking ahead, the industry expectation points to stable wafer prices, in equilibrium between weak demand and steady polysilicon and crucible cost.
