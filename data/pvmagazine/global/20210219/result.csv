Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt is planning to invest another $200 million in its Polish production facility in Gdansk, in northern Poland.
The 50,000 square meter factory is being built in two phases. The start of production is planned for 2022 with an initial output of five gigawatt-hours (GWh) and, at a later stage, the capacity could be raised to 12 GWh. A new research and development center will also be set up in conjunction with the expansion plan.
“The investment will facilitate a ramp-up in the manufacturing capacity of battery modules and systems in order to fulfill contracts that Northvolt has secured with customers seeking long-term, high-volume supply agreements for complete battery system solutions across grid and industrial markets,” Northvolt CEO Peter Carlsson said.
The facility in Gdansk, which Northvolt operates together with contract manufacturing company South Bay Solutions, began operations in 2019. The factory will run on renewable energy, which will also be generated on site. The lithium-ion battery cells employed for production at the manufacturing plant will be supplied by the Northvolt Ett Gigafactory in Skellefteå, Sweden.
In addition to the Swedish and Polish gigafactories, Volkswagen and Northvolt are planning a 50-50 joint venture to establish another 16 GWh battery cell factory, with Salzgitter in Lower Saxony, Germany, the favored location. Northvolt’s industrial partners and customers include ABB, BMW, Scania, Siemens, Vattenfall, Vestas and the Volkswagen.

The new furnaces will add 2,200 metric tons of daily glass production capacity to the company's current output One of the two furnaces is located in the Chinese province of Anhui, with a daily capacity of 1,200 MT. The other lies in its Vietnamese factory and has a daily capacity of 1,000 MT. All the new capacity is compatible with the latest big-size module products. Flat Glass said its total capacity has grown to 8,600 MT per day and this figure is estimated to grow to 9,800 MT per day at an unspecified later stage.
Panel manufacturer Jinkosolar has secured 20 GW of orders for its 182mm-wafer-based modules. The solar manufacturer revealed the landmark deal yesterday in a press release published on the website of the Africa Solar Industry Association. The PV giant said “industry expectation” was for 100 GW of 182mm-based module production capacity this year, with demand supporting such volume. Jinko, along with peers JA Solar and Longi, in November predicted the trio would amass 54 GW of 182mm production lines this year.
Zhejiang's provincial departments of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the National Energy Administration (NEA) revealed in a draft proposal that the province may host around 13 GW of new solar between 2021 and 2025. As one of the richest provinces of China and with rapid development of renewable energy, Zhejiang had 15.2 GW of installed solar PV at the end of 2020. If the planned target is achieved, total installed PV will reach 28 GW by the end of 2025.

Carrier multiplication is a very promising process that, if applied with success, may dramatically increase the efficiency of PV devices. The process occurs when the absorption of a single photon results in the excitation of multiple electrons. In conventional solar cells, a single photon is able to excite only one electron across the bandgap of the cell, which makes all high-energy free carriers dissipate as heat.
Carrier multiplication is claimed to have the potential of bringing photovoltaics closer to exceeding the Shockley–Queisser – the maximum theoretical efficiency that a solar cell using a single p-n junction can possibly reach, calculated by examining the amount of electrical energy that is extracted per incident photon. To date, however, it has been applied to solar only in experimental research.
According to the Dutch researchers, the choice of the semiconductor materials enabling the effective exploitation of CM in solar cells and their bandgap should be between 0.6–1.0 electronvolt (eV), which would result in a maximum theoretical efficiency of around 44%.
They described a series of promising semiconductor materials, pointing out that 2D and bulk materials exhibit a near-ideal CM, with a low threshold photon energy and appreciably quantum yield (QY). The quantum yield describes the averaged number of excitons per absorbed photon.
The scientists highlighted that three main conditions have to be met to make this process viable in a PV device. The first one is asymmetric photoexcitation, which makes the excess photon energy move to the electron or the hole so that the CM threshold can be close to twice the bandgap. The second condition is that the exciton binding energy must be sufficiently small to generate free charge carriers. Furthermore, charge carrier mobilities need to be high enough for efficient charge carrier transport and collection at electrodes in a PV device.
“To efficiently harvest the solar spectrum and utilize the photon energy above the bandgap, the latter should have a value in the range 0.6–1.2 eV,” the Dutch group stated. “For photodiode applications, the optimal bandgap depends on the wavelength of the light to be converted into a photocurrent.” It also explained that these conditions were achieved with materials such as percolative lead selenide (PbSe) networks, bulk tin-lead (Sn-Pb) halide perovskites, and molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2). 
The academics also suggested that future research should improve electronic structure calculations to support development of new materials in which asymmetric transitions occur, leading to a lower CM threshold. Their findings were presented in the paper Emergence of new materials for exploiting highly efficient carrier multiplication in photovoltaics, published in Chemical Physics Review.

France's energy regulator, the CRE, has launched its 10th tender for the construction of utility-scale solar PV projects exceeding 500 kW in size. Bids must be submitted between June 14 and June 25, 2021.
The French authorities expect to allocate 450 MW for ground-mounted PV installations exceeding 5 MW in size, 180 MW for PV projects with an installed power of between 500 kW and 5 MW, and 70 MW for projects ranging from 500 kW to 10 MW, which will be built on parking shades.
The CRE specified that, if the number of eligible projects is greater than 700 MW, the allocated power may be increased to 1,000 MW: 650 MW, 250 MW, and 100 MW for the three categories, respectively. 
Solar projects selected in the tender must comply with France's new regulation, which prioritizes projects relying on low-carbon emission PV modules. These rules set out that the projects selected in the CRE4 tenders must have a carbon footprint of less than a certain limit of kg CO2/kW. This can be calculated through a ‘simplified’ procedure, which has been designed by France’s Environment & Energy Management Agency (ADEME).
France is currently supporting large-scale solar PV through these CRE4 tenders and also via mixed wind-solar tenders.
*The article was updated on February 22 to reflect that the total capacity for the second PV project category is 250 MW and not 1,250 MW, as we previously reported.

“The study, one of the first in Italy, began about two months ago and it includes an analysis of the territory both from the point of view of electricity production from photovoltaic plants and electricity consumption by local users,” project manager Christian Bartolomeo told pv magazine.
Bartolomeo expects each municipality to build a PV plant of about 40 to 50 kWp of capacity, making use of public funds.
Ènostra coop reports that each municipality should define tender details and invite a local PV installer in late spring. “The plants are expected to be built by the end of autumn, in order to create a centralized energy system that can provide electricity to be shared among the inhabitants.”
According to their site-specific estimates, the PV plants can cover the daytime needs of about 30 to 40 household users and four or five small businesses. “In this way, a member of our RECs [renewable energy communities] in Sardinia could benefit from an annual economic contribution of around €110 to €140 for each megawatt-hour of virtually self-consumed electricity.”
The €110 to €140 per megawatt-hour band is specific to the site, depending on factors like radiation, production, self-consumption, but also data granularity.
“Each REC also presents an almost unique social context and behavior, and for this reason, each one must be analyzed as a case in itself, in order to avoid making feasibility mistakes,” said Bartolomeo.
Bartolomeo explains that ènostra coop aims to trigger collective actions and foster social inclusions in presenting the projects to local authorities and the population.
“RECs represent a solution to supply renewable electricity to local consumers who do not have suitable surfaces to install their own PV systems. In fact, local municipalities can free up surfaces on public buildings.”
Despite the logistical complexities due to coronavirus-related measures, the company is participating in the decision-making groups with stakeholders and institutional bodies. A local presence is necessary.
“We organized an on-site information desk to assess the interest of local users and collect data related to their profile of consumption. We are now refining our REC model using real consumption data rather than the initial estimates,” Bartolomeo explained.
Current regulations restrict the boundaries of the RECs to the users connected to the same secondary cabin. The measure is meant to avoid power losses and decrease the pressure on the grids. Ènostra coop, like other stakeholders, is asking to remove this constraint in the future legislative framework. According to Bartolomeo, the change in regulation would trigger new and more complex projects in Italy.
Currently, ènostra coop is also teaming up with a private cooperative to develop an REC in Biccari, Puglia, and one in Ledro, in the province of Trento. It is also cooperating with local authorities, energy service companies and research centers in showing the need for concerted action to foster similar initiatives in Italy.

He didn't provide a timeframe for its implementation but said that the procurement exercise will be aimed at contracting 400 MW of wind and solar power and that only projects with complete approval projects will be allowed to compete. “The auction will be designed to prevent that one or two big projects secure the entire allocated capacity,” he specified.
In the first renewable energy auction launched in August and finalized in December, the HROTE contracted only 25.5 MW of renewable energy capacity, although it had planned to assigned 88 MW. The allocated power went to 13.4 MW of solar projects, which secured a 12-year fixed tariff, and 7.7 MW of biomass plants, which were awarded a feed-in premium tariff.  The HROTE had received 108 bids with a combined capacity of 41.5 MW for the auction.
As for the solar technology, the selected 57 projects range in size from 50 to 500 kW. Their final average price was HRK 586.19 ($0.093)/kWh. The lowest bid was HRK 469.0 and the highest HRK 630.0.
The two exercises are part of a tender scheme for renewable energy and co-generation projects launched in May, with plans to allocate around 1,075 MW of PV capacity.
Overall, the government aims to assign 2.26 GW of renewable energy capacity under the scheme, while also including other sources such as hydropower, wind, biomass, biogas, and geothermal energy. For solar, the government has decided to allocate 210 MW for projects ranging in size from 50 kW to 500 kW, 240 MW for installations with capacities between 500 kW and 10 MW, and 625 MW for PV power plants exceeding 10 MW.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Croatia had 69 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2019. Croatia implemented a FIT scheme for rooftop solar which expired in 2015 after bringing around 50 MW of capacity online.

The scientists have embedded the cells with a “failsafe” that captures the lead ions. The device is made of hydroxyapatite, which is a naturally occurring mineral form of calcium apatite that is similar to hard tissues in humans, in terms of morphology and composition. The bio-inspired mineral, for example, is a major constituent of human bones.
The solar cell has a power conversion efficiency of 20.98% and is made of mixed mesoporous scaffolds based on hydroxyapatite nanoparticles that are blended with titanium oxide nanoparticles. These scaffolds are designed to limit the concentration of lead released in water from intentionally broken perovskite solar cells by ion sequestration.

“We embarked on this research as we were committed to eliminating an environmental risk,” said researcher Brian Saunders. “That commitment has resulted in increasing both the sustainability and the efficiency of perovskite solar cells.”
The researchers claim that the cell's efficiency increased by around 3% with the addition of hydroxyapatite. They described the cell in “Bioinspired scaffolds that sequester lead ions in physically damaged high efficiency perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Chemical Communications.
A similar technique was developed by scientists of the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) last year. They used a lead-absorbing material to coat the front and rear of a perovskite solar cell stack. The researchers claim that the films captured 96% of lead leakage when the cells were damaged.
Scientists from Purdue University in the United States also recently unveiled new organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials. They said the materials can improve the thermal stability of perovskite cells without lead. In addition, researchers from South Korea’s Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology recently claimed to have identified a tin-based perovskite that could open up possibilities for the application of lead-free perovskites in solar cells.

The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) has released its draft determination for the Default Market Offer (DMO) 2021-2022, and it provides good news for consumers – especially those living in New South Wales, southeastern Queensland, and South Australia. The good news is that electricity prices are falling continuously.
The DMO, which was introduced in 2019, is a reference price for consumers to compare against retail electricity contracts. It also caps the prices that retailers can charge consumers on a standing offer contract. The DMO 2021-22 period will see a year-on-year reduction in electricity prices of between 4.6% and 7.9% for residential customers (region dependent) and between 4.1% and 8.5% for small business consumers (also region dependent).

“Since the introduction of the DMO in 2019, residential and small business standing offer consumers have seen their yearly bills reduce by hundreds of dollars. We have also seen retailer competition remain steady,” said AER Chair Clare Savage. “It’s also critical for consumers to remember the DMO is intended as a safety net for those who don’t or can’t shop around and it’s not designed to be the most competitive deal. Most retailers have cheaper energy deals on offer, so shopping around remains the best way to get the best price.”
Dan van Holst Pellekaan, South Australia's minister for energy and mining, said the draft DMO continues the good work, which has seen electricity bills fall by AUD 111 ($86.35) since the middle of 2020. Pellekaan added that more savings are on the horizon, particularly with the development of the South Australia-New South Wales interconnector, which has been “modeled to deliver an additional AUD 100 cut to power bills for households.”
According to the AER, the main factor driving these decreasing prices is the “continued strong investments in renewable generation” which is changing the shape of load profiles and reducing wholesale energy costs. AER’s draft also found that the “median effective price paid by customers with solar systems was around 24% lower than non-soar customers in DMO regions and Victoria.”
The draft DMO prices for July 1, 2021, to June 30, 2022, is no open for public submissions until March 18.

A new report by the CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF) has shown that India’s grid-scale solar capacity additions in the third quarter (October-December) of the country's 2020-21 fiscal year reached 1,125 MW. This is more than double the 529 MW of grid-scale capacity added in the preceding quarter (July-September).
Rooftop solar additions reached 289 MW in the October-December period. Overall, the nation added 1,414 MW of solar from utility-scale and rooftop projects combined, compared to just 928 MW installed in the preceding three-month period.  
Solar continued to dominate, accounting for 73% of the 1.9 GW of renewable capacity additions (grid-scale solar, rooftop solar, wind, and biomass) added in the third quarter of the fiscal year.
“The performance … has further reiterated the promise the sector holds. To meet the 450 GW renewables target, India needs investments worth more than $200 billion for generating capacity alone,” said Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive officer at CEEW. “Significant additional funds will be required for supporting infrastructure such as storage and transmission. The focus must now be on reducing the cost of finance and embracing innovative financing models such as a time-bound credit enhancement scheme to accelerate the growth of the sector.”

Aided by strong industry tailwinds, SunPower exceeded the top end of its guidance to post $412 million in net income and $39 million in adjusted EBITA for the fourth quarter of 2020.
“We see significant opportunity to drive long-term growth through the expansion of our addressable market,” SunPower CEO Tom Werner said during an earnings call this week.
Storage, digital solutions, and the company’s distributed-generation services platform will be key to the company’s long-term growth, he said. Over the next 30 years, SunPower expects the distribution-generation solar and storage market to grow to become a $65 billion market.
In January, SunPower announced plans to extend its residential installation business into seven new markets across six states by the end of the second quarter. The markets targeted for the first quarter include Tucson, Arizona, and Fresno, California, among others.
The company also said it plans to hire more than 300 field technicians in 2021 and aims to complete twice as many installs year over year. In addition, it said in January that it would close its solar panel manufacturing plant in Hillsboro, Oregon, in a move that affected 170 employees.
Supply chain
“We are managing the supply chain very closely,” said Norm Taffe, executive vice president of products at SunPower.
He said that the company doesn’t think that supply-chain constraints will limit the ability of its 26 kWh SunVault solar+storage solution to hit this year’s revenue expectations. Recently opened sales markets outside of California are expected to provide another driver of growth. Starting in the second quarter, the company will be able to “attack our installed base with SunVault,” Taffe said.
SunPower’s fourth quarter commercial and industrial installs rose more than 65% sequentially, accompanied by gross margin expansion and progress on cost control programs. Demand for the company’s Helix storage solution for commercial and industrial customers also remained high, the company said. In 2020, Helix sales attach rates were above 30%, and the company installed 18 MWh during the year.
SunPower recently signed its first contracts linked to the California Public Utility Commission’s self-generation incentive program for storage. It also expanded its community solar pipeline to more than 90 MW. It said its combined backlog and pipeline of more than 800 MWh and its high sales attach rate for Helix leave it well placed to capitalize on increased demand for its commercial storage and services solutions.
