The Zamudio-based will ship 59 containerized lithium-ion batteries plus 15 power station units to an unnamed client in northern Italy, Ingeteam announced last week. It said the grid-connected facility will go live in 2023.
It said the power stations – which will include transformers, switchgear and ancillary services, plus “the integration of the batteries in containers” – will be “fully European in manufacture.” The system, which will be installed to supply grid services, will have a power rating of 70 MW and storage capacity of 340 MWh, based on 2.88 MW/5.76 MWh containers.
“This project in itself represents the energy transition towards a renewable energy-based model in which energy storage plays a fundamental role,” Stefano Domenicali, MD of Ingeteam Italy, said in a press release issued by the company last week. “It is necessary to promote the transition to a new energy model decisively and ambitiously, and not only to achieve a clean energy model but also because renewables are the most competitive generating technology as well as being the drivers of local employment and the only ones to ensure that each country can achieve energy independence.”
Ingeteam said it recently commissioned the “first large-scale PV plant in Spain to incorporate an energy storage system.” The Arañuelo III solar project features a 3 MW/9 MWh storage system installed with DC coupling, so the battery converters share a DC connection with the PV inverters.

It said the senior secured loan will support Intro-SR’s equity stake in a portfolio of PV, energy efficiency, waste-to-energy, and waste management projects. The installations will include one of the first private-to-private energy generation projects in Egypt, as well as the expansion of a plastic bottle recycling facility.
The investments will all support energy efficiency, according to the EBRD. It did not reveal many details about the solar project it will support, other than to say that the funds it provides will be used to refinance a PV array developed under the first round of the Egyptian feed-in-tariff (FIT) scheme.
Intro Sustainable Resource, owned by Intro Investments Holding, was set up in 2020 to develop renewables and energy efficiency projects. Egypt-based Intro Solar, meanwhile, is a special purpose vehicle that runs a 5 MW solar plant developed under the first round of the nation's FIT program.
The EBRD has now invested more than €8.5 billion in 144 projects throughout Egypt since 2012. In 2020, it announced plans to provide $36 million to ACWA Power, in support of a 200 MW solar project in Kom Ombo, Egypt. The loan was part of a broader $114 million solar financing package involving the OPEC Fund for International Development and the African Development Bank.

It will also generate enough electricity for about 160,000 homes across the United Arab Emirates. Following the start of commercial operations, it is expected to slash Abu Dhabi’s carbon emissions by more than 2.4 million metric tons per year, according to EWEC.
“Our strategic investments in solar power have seen us develop Noor Abu Dhabi, the current world’s largest single-site solar power plant, and Al Dhafra Solar PV, which will be the new world’s largest single-site solar power plant once commercially operational,” said EWEC CEO Othman Al Ali. “With Al Ajban Solar PV, which will be similar in size and capacity output to Al Dhafra Solar PV, Abu Dhabi and the UAE will have the three largest, world-leading solar power plants, increasing the diversification of our energy production portfolio, and significantly advancing decarbonisation of the energy sector.”
Bidders will be expected to handle the development, financing, construction, operation, maintenance and ownership of the plant. The winning developer will take up to a 40% stake in the project, with the remainder to be indirectly held by the government of Abu Dhabi.
EWEC will sign a long-term power purchase agreement with the selected developer. The PPA will be structured as an energy purchase agreement, under which EWEC will only pay for the net electrical energy supplied by the solar plant.
The company said prospective developers must submit their documents by noon (GST) on May 27.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/11/world-bank-spells-out-how-pakistan-can-hit-13-gw-of-clean-power/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,PAKISTAN",MAX HALL,"MAY 11, 2022",World Bank spells out how Pakistan can hit 13 GW of clean power,"A new report published by the World Bank has stated that Pakistan must introduce the renewable energy auctions approved by its energy regulator in 2017 without any further delay if it is to achieve its clean energy ambitions.
The nation's National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) approved a switch from paying fixed tariffs for clean electricity five years ago, but a proposed auction system has yet to take shape.
With Pakistan having 1.7 GW of solar and wind generation capacity in September 2021, and aiming to raise that figure to 12.9 GW this decade, the need for urgency is clear and the World Bank report suggests how Islamabad could kick-start the process.
Some 482 MW of solar projects have been granted a tariff but are yet to be constructed. A proportion of a further 72 projects with 4.34 GW of capacity, which have secured approval but not a fixed payment, can be expected to secure auction-determined rewards as bidders under an interim system before a complete switch to an auction regime suggested by the report's authors.
That would then see Pakistan award 1 GW per year of solar via annual auctions from 2024 to 2030, en route to achieving 20% of the nation's electricity from non-hydro renewables by 2025, and 30% this decade, as part of overall clean energy targets of 50% and 60% which would include hydropower facilities.
The World Bank suggests a twin-track approach which would see big renewable energy parks identified chiefly in the wind-rich provinces of Balochistan and Sindh plus smaller project capacities auctioned within reach of electricity substations with spare capacity. The clean energy park auctions would be solar or wind specific to ensure a mix of facilities to maximize generation and transmission while the substation tenders would be technology neutral but could be expected to heavily favor solar plants.
The report suggests government entity the Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) be responsible for overseeing the clean energy park tenders with provincial electricity distribution companies fulfilling the role for substation capacity procurement, with a federal body to take charge of renewables auctions further down the line.
The generation capacity tendered should be in blocks of at least 50 MW, the report's authors suggested, with 300 MW to 600 MW slices in the large parks and tariffs should be set no later than 33 weeks after each auction process begins. The auctions should each feature a maximum bid price, set with reference to previous exercises, and the resulting power purchase agreements (PPAs) should last 20 to 25 years, according to the study.
The report's authors state that, in contrast to a recommendation made in the government's 2019 Alternative Renewable Energy policy: “We do not recommend stringent local content requirements.”
Local industry
With Pakistan unlikely to develop a local solar industry beyond module assembly from imported components, the report suggests high technical standards be set for the auction bidders, to avoid the dumping of cheap, low-grade overseas products.
The shift to an auction system is complicated by the fact the government has approved changes to its national energy market which should have come into force in April this year but have not taken place. The new regime would see national body the Central Power Purchasing Agency replaced as offtaker for clean electricity by provincial distribution companies, who would also take over management of the auctions from the AEDB.
For an interim period, during which the 4.34 GW of approved solar projects without a tariff can participate in auctions, the PPA on offer will last 25 years and the bid cap has been set at PKR 6/kWh ($0.032), with payments rising by a maximum of 2.5% annually during the contract period.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/11/brazil-to-become-leading-global-solar-market-by-2026-says-solarpower-europe/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,BRAZIL,CENTRAL & SOUTH AMERICA",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"MAY 11, 2022","Brazil to become major global solar market by 2026, says SolarPower Europe","SolarPower Europe’s “Global Market Outlook for Solar Power 2022-26” report, launched in Munich during the Intersolar Solar event, paints a sunny picture for solar throughout the world. This year’s report also features a special focus on the Latin American market, written in collaboration with the Global Solar Council and the Brazilian solar PV association, ABSOLAR.  
In 2021, Latin America’s PV capacity additions increased by 44%, totaling 9.6 GW, with cumulative capacity 0f more than 30 GW. The region’s solar market has grown more than 40 times since 2015. Projections suggest that by 2026, it could grow by up to 30.8 GW per year. In this incredible success story, one country emerges as a rising star: Brazil.  
Latin America’s solar leader is set to become one of the top five global markets in the next five years, reaching 54 GW total solar capacity by 2026, according to SolarPower Europe. pv magazine recently sat down with Dr. Rodrigo Lopes Sauaia, the CEO of ABSOLAR, to discuss the report and Brazil’s place in the global solar market. 
As of April 2022, Brazil had surpassed 15 GW of total installed solar, with more than 5 GW added in 2021 alone. Distributed-generation systems account for 10 GW of installed capacity, and large-scale solar PV power plants for 5 GW. Distributed generation registered record growth in 2021, but that may well be surpassed in 2022.  
The passage of a long-awaited distributed generation law explains the growth surge, Sauaia told pv magazine. The law ensures that all distributed solar systems in operation and all new requests performed until 2023 will be eligible for full net metering until the end of 2045. Connection requests performed from 2023 on will be subject to a new net-metering regime, which gradually introduces grid fees for the electricity injected into the grid.  
According to Suaia, these fees will not lead to a loss of interest in solar.
“There is no risk of market collapse. We believe this solution will help the system continue to grow, without annoying utility companies,” Suaia said. “Electricity tariffs increased by 20% to 25% in the past year, overcoming an inflation rate of 10%. These payments will remain competitive for end-consumers to choose solar.”
The country’s other main market segment, centralized generation, also saw a record number of new projects in 2021, with most of them targeting bilateral power purchase agreements in Brazil's so-called free electricity market. Government-regulated market auctions used to be the rule in Brazil, but a weakened economy prompted the federal government to scale back the size of auctions in 2021. Solar’s cost competitiveness has incentivized large consumers such as shopping malls to enter into bilateral agreements with generation companies, in order to own or lease their large-scale solar PV plants and reduce their electricity bills, Sauaia explained.  
Energy storage is also expected to grow in Brazil. However, it still faces high taxes, a lack of regulatory frameworks, and insufficient incentive schemes for end users.
“We also faced these issues with solar. We have learnt a lot and are using that experience to inform the rapid growth of storage in Brazil,” said Sauaia.
ABSOLAR has set up a working group to propose a roadmap for storage, in partnership with two consulting firms. Their work will focus on regulation and legislation, taxation, access to financing, and technical norms.
“The future is bright,” concluded Sauaia.

The platform integrates its own PV inverter tech and lithium-ion storage solutions by China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL).
According to the Chinese inverter and battery manufacturer, its new 3-Ph BluE Residential ESS battery is able to support 200% oversized PV power and configure a simple efficient on&off grid parallel system.
“The new product will be available in Europe,” a CATL spokesperson told pv magazine. The person added that it is “ideal for three-phase residential applications and also suitable for commercial and industrial projects.”
According to the company, its three-phase features a stable “module, pack, system” triple protection. The product comes with adjustable power in each phase, supporting diesel generator control.

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which serves 10 million people in the southeastern United States, released its fiscal 2021 report on sustainability, revealing progress toward climate goals and high targets for carbon-free generation through the next decade.
“The vitality and growth of our region is underpinned by low-cost, reliable and clean energy. Over the past five years, TVA has worked with state and local partners to deliver about 350,000 jobs and $45.9 billion in capital investments,” said President and CEO Jeff Lyash.
Lyash stated goals of targeting up to 10 GW of solar by 2035, and more than 200,000 electric vehicles on TVA roadways by 2028. Operating and contracted solar capacity grew 77% in fiscal 2021, and the first TVA-built utility-scale solar and battery projects are underway and expected to be online by 2024-25. The utility expects to have about 2.8 GW of solar in TVA operation by 2024.
However, the sustainability report reveals that TVA owns 1 MW of operable solar capacity and reports no ownership of wind energy assets, as of the fiscal 2021 report. This is largely due to the fact that TVA is unable to access the federal investment tax credit dedicated to solar projects. To secure the best rate for solar in its territory, TVA instead has developers play the role of owner-operator, so that the incentive can be utilized and customer rates can remain low. A company spokesperson told pv magazine that as of Feb. 1, TVA has 642 MW of operating solar.
Renewable energy capacity owned and in operation by TVA has decreased slightly each year since 2019, according to the report. Currently, TVA has 5,386 MW of renewable energy capacity, nearly all of which is hydropower. In addition to the hydropower production, TVA reports it purchased 7,269 MW of renewable energy from outside sources in fiscal 2021.
“We have a plan to achieve a 70% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and a path to about 80% by 2035. We aspire to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050,” wrote Revecca Tolene, TVA’s chief sustainability officer.
TVA has already reduced emissions by 57% since 2005. Much of that has come from the retirement of coal plants and the activation of more nuclear power, which grew from a 26% share to 41%. Coal shrank from 57% of operations to 16% over that period. Solar and wind energy were not meaningfully represented in the 2005 figures, and now hold just 3% of the energy mix.
Investment programs
The utility said it has committed nearly $3 billion in solar investments through its Green Invest program since 2018. A large driver of growth in this program is through contracts with large corporations like Google, Meta (Facebook), and others.
The federally owned utility contracted for 1,178 MW of utility-scale solar generation by the end of fiscal 2020. It also implemented the Green Connect program in fiscal 2021, creating a qualified solar contractor network. The program has achieved 19 qualified installers, over 1000 customers registered, about 200 installations submitted, 65 installations verified, and over $7.5 million of customer spending on systems within the Green Connect network.
TVA runs another program called Green Switch, which provides customers with 100% renewable energy at a small premium. The utility said contracts can be signed for as low as $2 per month, and customers can match some or all their current electricity use with a mix of solar, wind and biomass generation sources located in the valley. In fiscal 2021, the mix was approximately 70% solar, 20% wind and 10% biomass sources.
The utility said it has invested over $2 billion in transmission system improvements through 2025, perhaps paving the way for the interconnection of 10 GW of solar by 2035.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/11/intersolar-europe-day-1-welcome-to-munich/,,PV MAGAZINE,"UPDATED MAY 13, 2022 10:34 PM CET",Intersolar Europe Day 1: The bumpy road facing Europe’s solar manufacturers,"Many a real estate owner is torn: Should they promote biodiversity and green his roof against the warming of inner cities, or should they rather generate as much electricity as possible to combat climate change? Contec customers can do both. The company offers a substructure in the form of a plastic tub. In the tub, the plants grow on a substrate layer that can store 40 to 90 liters of water at the same time.
The tub is shaped in such a way that an aluminum stand is integrated into it, on which various PV modules can be mounted. The tub functions as ballast against wind loads. The lower edges of the modules are always at least 20 cm from the ground to allow plants to grow. Some cities in Germany require greening of new buildings. This now no longer excludes photovoltaics.
Against the backdrop of a giant polar bear posing for photos, AE Solar unveiled its new PV-thermal hybrid solar module for generating both electricity and warm water.
The Neptune module series boasts efficiencies of between 20.31 and 20.86%, a power output of up to 380 W, and a thermal power rating of 964 W; and is kitted out with mono crystalline half cut solar cells. It is being produced this year in “very limited” capacities, but the company plans to develop capacities further in the coming years, Hamed Hanifi, Head of Development, told pv magazine.
Also on display were the German solar manufacturer’s patented shade resistant PV modules – the efficiency of which were demonstrated by Hanifi, a cardboard strip, spotlights, and a rather fetching water feature; and its Aurora module series which boasts power ratings of up to 670 W and efficiencies of up to 21.4%.
It’s HJT bifacial half cut cell, double glass PV module, the Comet, was another feature. While it launched last year, we are reportedly the first media outlet to get the lowdown on the details; namely: a power output of 460-480 W, efficiencies of up to 22.10%, and a “very low” temperature coefficient of 0.26% thus making it ideal for extreme climates. It also comprises POE encapsulation and measures 2,215 mm x 1,135 mm x 2,230 mm.
The second half of 2022 is going to see Trina Solar focusing more on sustainability. In addition to participating in our upcoming roundtable session on the topic, the Chinese manufacturer has joined several initiatives, like 1.5 degrees, and is a founding member of the Global Alliance for Sustainable Energy. The alliance aims to bring all types of renewable energy companies together to define and roll out best practices and standards for pushing the energy transition further.
In house, the company has dedicated a large team to look at issues like PV module recycling, sustainable design, materials, and packaging. Trina is also gearing up to publish its first ESG report soon. Watch out for more details at the pv magazine Roundtables this June.
There are numerous plans for solar cell and module manufacturing operations to be established or expanded outside China but many are delayed by the current uncertain business climate, not least in promising European and North American markets.
Italian solar panel backsheet producer Coveme works closely with module makers and is all too aware of the progress being made – or not, as the case may be.
Coveme’s Michele Vannini and Alessandro Anderlini, present at Intersolar, noted how a combination of Covid-19 and war in Ukraine have made diversifying Europe's energy supply imperative – whether that be to avoid dependence on Russian gas or Chinese solar modules.
The pair reported confusion over what sort of support solar manufacturers might receive from policymakers in Europe and North America.
Coveme is a partner in pv magazine‘s UP Initiative. The company aims to foster sustainable practices within the solar industry and has plans to invest in new production lines for front and backsheets next year, in Italy, that would employ solvent-free and special coating technologies with a low environmental impact.
Given sufficient demand, the new backsheet production line in Italy will be capable of producing enough product for around 4 GW to 5 GW of solar modules, Anderlini said.
Established German engineering, procurement, and construction services provider Pfalzsolar has some top-rated show goodies on offer in this year's fierce swag stakes.

With a leaked paper about the European Commission's planned solar strategy doing the rounds, MEP Michael Bloss has just said the document due out in a week's time does not contain a proposal for mandatory solar on all new EU buildings, Beatriz Santos reports.
The German politician did, however, signal to Jacek Truszczynski, of the commission's directorate general for economic and financial affairs, that the document could still be amended in the next few days.
The commissioner refused to comment on the issue.
Amid a heated debate about the battery technologies that could prove game-changers, British sodium-ion specialist Faradion has just touted media interest in its tech and who are we to argue, as pv magazine‘s Marija Maisch observes proceedings!
Shoals Technologies, long a major player in the US large scale solar business, has found its “big lead assembly” technology, which aims to cut much of the complexity out of the wiring and electrical installation of solar plants, can also bring big benefits to EV charging infrastructure.
Keeping all wiring above ground in protective aluminum conduits, Shoals products can drastically speed installation.
As emphasized by the small solar system floating on the artificial lake outside the conference center, floating solar (FPV) is a rapidly growing niche.
As Charles Gery, of Seaflex, said in the Solid foundations – what's needed for developing and building successful floating solar projects session, “FPV is moving rapidly.”
Of particular interest are opportunities for floating solar to combine in symbiotic relationships with other systems, such as hydroelectric dams.
Seaflex's elastic mooring lines, which can hold multiple attachment points, have most recently been employed in a partially EU-funded project with Portuguese utility EDP, a 5 MW floating solar system on the Alqueva reservoir which is the biggest FPV project on a European hydro dam.
“The point of the project was to reduce the LCOE [levelized cost of energy] of hydro dam projects so that there can be more,” said Gery, who added the cost reductions were achieved and Portugal has now ordered 180 MW of floating solar for its hydroelectric dams.
After the presentation, pv magazine‘s Blake Matich spoke with Ran Alcalay, chief executive of Israeli floating solar tracker company Xfloat, who described a 10 MW in-shore project that will be completed in August.
Alcalay said Xfloat's horizontal trackers provide yield increases of 15% to 20% and represent a new phase of LCOE reduction for floating solar.
“The second wave of FPV is coming,” said Alcalay.
Are you a dab hand at plant design? Then here's a challenge for you.
There will be a competition at the RatedPower booth (460 in Hall A4). Whoever teases out the lowest electricity generation costs for a theoretical project will receive a prize.
While figuring out how to tamp down those expenses, you can get to know pvDesign, the software which, according to the company, can reduce project planning times and automate parts of the planning process such as the calculation of various system constellations.
If you are interested in finding out more about the software, you can try out the full license for 14 days and RatedPower released an improved user interface only last week, with more space for graphical planning.
Why not roll up at the stand and have a go? Staff are on hand who speak Spanish, Portuguese, German, English, French, and Chinese. Or you can have a gander at a RatedPower webinar to see how the software works, like this one hosted by pv magazine last year.
Alternatively, there is a German language seminar we are planning for June 8 and you can register for that here.
Solarud co-founder António Peres dropped by the pv magazine booth to give us a hands-on demonstration of his company's new water-draining device for rooftop PV systems.
The product was developed to resolve soiling issues associated with the frames of PV panels with low-inclination slopes, draining water that would otherwise stay stagnant on the surface of modules.
With claimed energy gains of 3.5%, on average, the Portuguese start-up hopes to attract big sales volumes, Peres said.
And for those not lucky enough to get a live demo, you can see how the device works here.
At the Cellcube booth, in Hall B2, Cornelia Lichner met the chief executive of vanadium redox flow battery manufacturer, Alexander Schönfeldt. He is convinced redox flow batteries score well where lithium batteries have weaknesses, for example for companies that want energy-neutral operation around the clock.
Schönfeldt told us about a project in Boling Brook, southwest of Chicago, where a manufacturer of electronic components bought a vanadium storage device to cover three business cases.
On the one hand, the company wanted renewable energy generated on site for four hours or more without needing to use the grid. Secondly, the business wanted protection against power failures, which would be fatal for its sensitive electrical components. The client uses a flywheel for the smooth transition from on to off-grid operation.
And thirdly, the customer wanted to use the storage for frequency control services and to partially refinance it with the resulting income.
Schönfeldt said the 2 MW/8 MWh battery storage system will go into operation this summer.
A project Cellcube started with a Dutch shipping company sounds even more exciting. The goal there is nothing less than the decarbonization of inland shipping.
Vessels with a normal travel time of eight hours, for example shuttle ships in ports, can be refueled with an active vanadium solution and then be powered electrically. When discharged, the vessel is pumped out onto a floating pontoon where it can be recharged from shore.
Cellcube's strategic partner Portliner is currently building the shell of the ship and the aim is to develop a kit for equipping and converting vessels.
Ship operators could thus avoid CO2 emission prices. The Cellcube solution would occupy around 10% of the loading capacity of a ship, to hold 350,000 to 500,000 liters of vanadium, but of course you wouldn’t need a diesel tank any more.
It is an inspiring Cellcube hopes to see go live in the next 12 months.
C'mon readers, you can do it!
We're such social media bunnies here at pv mag Towers we're excited to share the news we are fast approaching 100,000 followers on LinkedIn.
C'mon then! What are you waitin' for?
Trina Storage is showcasing its 2.1 MWh DC All-New Elementa, with 25% increased battery cycling, its first storage product integrating proprietary battery cells, writes Marija Maisch.
“We control the supply chain ourselves,” said Ken Rush, head of product and engineering.
Demand for battery storage is ramping up and Trina Storage knows that well. The business is sold out for the year and continues to scale-up production as we speak. Current order waiting times are around six to seven months and, as Rush confirmed for pv magazine, a “large portion” of Trina's 3 GWh lithium ferrophosphate (LFP) capacity is in production and will be scaled up in the near future.
The Trina Storage rep added, “high-level pricing” stands at around $250/kWh, with project-dependent factors affecting final price tag. The All-New Elementa may be massive in size but it can fit into a shipping container.
With the whole industry (and many others) roiled by logistics, component, freight, and shipping headaches, spare a thought for Chinese solar manufacturer Eging PV.
The company hadn't quite managed to put its booth together by lunchtime today, with a representative blaming problems with logistics affecting the arrival of booth components.
Deep in hall A6, our intrepid Mark Hutchins has been confronted with a series of odd tree-like structures, and felt compelled to find out more.
Bart Veeneman, who works in sales support for Netherlands-based Ecoplant, was quick to explain that the larger of the two structures packs more than 2 kilowatts of solar capacity onto its circular top, which tracks the sun from. Each structure can also be integrated with an inverter and energy storage.
The company has been installing the devices at commercial and residential projects in the Netherlands for a few years already, and at the exhibition this year, Ecoplant is on the hunt for distribution partners to bring its tech further afield.
Here's some show numbers from Sandra Enkhardt, the heart and soul of our German website:
Across 12 exhibition halls and 132,000 m2, some 1,356 exhibitors will show their innovative PV and storage products, services, and business models for a new energy world. More than 50,000 visitors are expected at the three-day show.
After the launch of SolarPower Europe’s Global Market Outlook yesterday, pv magazine sat down with Rafaelle Rossi, the trade body's head of market intelligence; and Christophe Lits, one of SPE's market analysts.
Last year, 167.8 GW of grid-connected solar capacity was added worldwide for 21% growth over the 139.2 GW added in 2020. SPE anticipates solar capacity will this year increase by 36%, to 228.5 GW, an only slightly less optimistic figure than IHS Markit’s 232 GW and BloombergNEF’s 245 GW. Price hikes and project delays explain SPE’s caution in its short-term prediction but the association’s expectations are higher than the other analysts’ for the medium term, Rossi pointed out.
When asked whether solar can sustain exponential growth in the long term – 10 to 15 years – Rossi and Lits expressed optimism. “New applications will counterbalance the high penetration of solar”, said the former. Lits highlighted the potential of building and vehicle-integrated PV, floating solar, and green hydrogen as promising applications.
The global outlook report pays special attention to Latin America, “a region that often passes under the radar” but whose solar market has grown more than 40 times since 2015. Brazil takes central stage in the region, having installed more than 15 GW of solar by April, a figure achieved under a government that is not particularly favorable to the technology. If the opposition takes over in the next election, matters can only get better, added Lits. 
“I did not come by company car,” Tobias Badelt, from the battery storage systems department of Rolls Royce Solutions, assured attendees at an Intersolar event. “I came by train from Berlin where I ride an electric bike.”
Rolls Royce now owns Berlin-based electricity storage specialist Qinous and has installed more than 100 microgrids across five continents, writes Blake Matich.
“Rolls Royce knows that it needs to change,” said Badelt, who talked the conference through the merits of a containerized Samsung LFP battery energy storage solution with capacities ranging from 100 kWh up to 2.2 MWh sealed inside 40 ft containers which arrive from Germany ready to work.
“The first system was installed in 2014-15 in Haiti … and all our solutions are still working, and our experience is that when our systems work, they work for at least 25 years,” said the Rolls Royce rep.
Such long-term confidence has, of course, always been the basis of the luxury carmaker’s reputation.
Meeting a rapid increase in demand isn’t impossible for PV mounting system manufacturers in Europe, even as the rest of the industry has struggled to ramp up.
At an Intersolar conference session dedicated to EU balance-of-system manufacturing, mounting systems maker Esdec Solar Group said early 2022 demand had doubled compared to the same period of last year.
Marc Dalderup, director of business development and market intelligence at Esdec, told the assembled crowd the first 18 weeks of 2022 had seen orders increase twofold, year on year.
Speaking with pv magazine after the panel event, Dalderup confirmed that this was around 20% above early 2020 demand, during those halcyon pre-pandemic days.
Dalderup said mounting systems were the first to respond to demand and are able to more easily meet the needs of a market being driven by the energy crisis and push for replacement sources of energy. The Dutch manufacturer confirmed the supply of inverters has been a pain point. Unusually, some rooftop solar projects have been going ahead and installing modules on rooftops even without an inverter, as project lead times increase.
Could the long fight between engineers and architects soon settle into a compromise?
In yesterday’s catchily-titled conference session BIPV: Beautiful, multi-functional, and compelling – The long-awaited rise of solar as building material is in sight (Phew! Pauses for breath), panelists discussed the long disparity between engineers who want PV everywhere and architects who don’t like constraints to their originality, such as those exemplified by materials of limited color and shape.
The technical progress of digital ceramic printing, interferential coatings (your guess is as good as our man Blake's), and colored foils, mean building-integrated PV solutions are now variable enough to meet a wide variety of aesthetics while generating solar energy.
Of course, it is not until these solutions are more widely adopted by architects – and standardized by engineers – that the age of BIPV will truly arrive.
Thankfully, as vice president of Swiss research center CSEM and director of the Sustainable Energy Center Switzerland, Christophe Ballif explained: “People are ready to pay more for something that is nice and something that is made locally. And more means something like 20%-30%.”
Fast growing battery system provider Tesvolt has tapped decades of solar industry experience to guide its next stage of expansion. Philipp Koecke joined Tesvolt as chief financial officer just weeks ago and stepped out at The Smarter E show to set out the company’s growth strategy.
Managing working capital is one of Koecke’s first priorities with suppliers right across the solar supply chain having to manage inventories in light of shortages of key components. As a result of Tesvolt’s healthy inventory levels, the company is able to ship its new E Series battery system – which includes the TS-I HV at 80 kWh of capacity and TS-1 HV1000, with 90 kWh, in 2-3 months – setting itself apart from rivals, the business claims.
The E Series has been designed to use 80% fewer chips, in response to global shortages.
Koecke joined Tesvolt so recently he doesn’t even have business cards in Munich. However, having served as CFO of controversial German module maker SolarWorld for more than 15 years, his reputation proceeds him.
#Protip: Tesvolt veteran Mathias Zdzieblowski says you can swing by the booth for “bier after vier.”
Ahead of the exhibition that is getting under way as we speak, the Intersolar conference yesterday afternoon brought stark warnings of the task that confronts Europe’s solar industry following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, writes Mark Hutchins.
“This is also a war against renewable energy,” Artem Semenyshyn, of the Solar Energy Association of Ukraine, told the audience.
The session painted encouraging pictures for solar growth in Europe, taking in rising demand in regions from the Nordic nations to Italy and Portugal, and European markets can expect to ramp up significantly given the continent’s urgent desire to cut its dependence on Russian gas imports.
Semenyshyn closed yesterday's presentation by saying: “This new energy reality is real driver for PV.”
A new Qcells has arrived! In April, the company announced its new brand identity, including a new logo, new mission, new values, and new slogan.
QCells has long been renowned as a leading solar cell and module supplier and, more recently, as a provider of smart storage solutions, 100% renewable electricity supply contracts, and a developer of large scale renewable energy projects. So the time was right for it to reconsider its core competencies and how they were reflected in its brand image.
The result is a striking new logo and a unifying slogan: Completely Clean Energy. Qcells aims for a greener tomorrow with completely clean energy solutions. To achieve this goal, it will be a trailblazer in its bold actions and ideas; offer stewardship through greater compassion and purpose; and be a paragon of good and excellence – driving the world towards a cleaner future via Qcells’ technical expertise and unshakeable belief in finding a better way.
Find out more at the Qcells booth in Hall A1 (A1.180 and A1.270).
In recent years, Longi has turned its attention to green hydrogen. Li Zhenguo, company founder and CEO, recently spoke to pv magazine about its strategic shift and how he believes that coupling this technology with solar PV will be the key to achieving carbon neutrality.

To get the show on the road with the pv magazine beat patrol, our own Beatriz Santos asked SolarPower Europe's Dries Acke how the industry can avoid forever having its potential underestimated.
Getting a head start on his new mission to advocate for an expanded role for PV in Europe’s energy transition, SolarPower Europe’s new policy director, Dries Acke, attended The Smarter E conference in Munich yesterday. That, in itself demonstrated commitment to the cause as Acke will not officially begin his new position until next week.
Describing the EU as “at a fork in the road” in terms of energy policy, Acke said he hopes to help European policy makers recognize solar’s full potential – and turn around previous misconceptions that have seen it underestimated in the bloc’s strategy. Based on the bloc's current estimates for solar, the EU is “at risk of predicting less than business as usual,” according to Acke. The Brussels-based lobbyist said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has EU member states considering whether they should be focused on securing fossil fuel alternatives to Russia or accelerating the energy transition – an option which would see solar emerge as a true “hero.”
With the European Commission scheduled to deliver its long-awaited solar energy strategy next week, Acke already has a packed in-tray. SolarPower Europe is ready for swift action if the commission’s announcement does not meet expectations.
Before joining SolarPower Europe, Acke was director for the energy systems initiative at the European Climate Foundation.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/11/no-end-to-solar-supply-demand-imbalance/,"MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"MAY 11, 2022",No end to solar supply/demand imbalance,"From pv magazine 05/2022
PV InfoLink projects global PV module demand to reach 223 GW this year, with an optimistic forecast of 248 GW. Cumulative installed capacity is expected to reach 1 TW by year’s end.
China still dominates PV demand. The policy-driven 80 GW of module demand will beef up solar market development. In second place is the European market, which is working to accelerate renewables development to wean itself off Russian natural gas. Europe is expected to see 49 GW of module demand this year.
The third-largest market, the United States, has seen diversified supply and demand since last year. Disrupted by the Withhold Release Order (WRO), supply is unable to catch up with demand. Moreover, the investigation into anti-circumvention in Southeast Asia this year causes further uncertainty in cell and module supply for US orders and adds to the low utilization rates in Southeast Asia amid impacts of WRO.
As a result, supply to the US market will fall short of demand throughout this year; module demand will stay at last year’s 26 GW or even lower. The three largest markets together will contribute to around 70% of demand.

Demand in the first quarter of 2022 stayed at around 50 GW, despite persistently high prices. In China, projects deferred from last year were commenced. While ground-mounted projects were postponed due to high module prices over the short term, and demand from distributed-generation projects continued due to lower price sensitivity. In markets outside of China, India witnessed strong inventory draw prior to the introduction of basic custom duty (BCD) on April 1, with 4 GW to 5 GW of demand in the first quarter. Steady demand continued in the US, while Europe saw stronger-than-expected demand with robust order requests and signings. The EU’s market acceptance for higher prices also increased.

Overall, demand in the second quarter may be spurred by distributed generation and some utility-scale projects in China, while Europe’s strong module inventory draws amid the accelerated energy transition, and steady demand from the Asia-Pacific region. The US and India, on the other hand, is expected to see dwindling demad, owing respectively to anti-circumvention investigation and lofty BCD rates. Yet, demand from all regions together amass 52 GW, slightly higher than in the first quarter.
Under current pricing levels, China’s guaranteed installed capacity will drive inventory draws from utility-scale projects in the third and fourth quarter, while distributed generation projects will continue. Against this backdrop, the Chinese market will continue to consume large volumes of modules.
The outlook for the US market will remain obscured until results of the anti-circumvention investigation are unveiled at the end of August. Europe continues to see bullish demand, with no evident high or low seasons throughout the year.
Overall, demand in the second half of the year will surpass that in the first half. PV Infolink predicts a gradual increase over time, reaching a peak in the fourth quarter.
As shown in the graph (left), polysilicon supply has improved from last year and is likely to meet end-user demand. Yet, InfoLink predicts that polysilicon supply will remain short due to the following factors: Firstly, it will take about six months for new production lines to reach full capacity, meaning production is limited. Secondly, the time taken for new capacity to come online varies among manufacturers, with capacity growing slowly during first and second quarter, and then increasing markedly in the third and fourth quarter. Lastly, despite continued polysilicon production, Covid-19’s resurgence in China has disrupted supply, leaving it unable to meet demand from the wafer segment, which holds huge capacity.
Raw material and BOM price trends decide whether module prices will stay on the rise. Like polysilicon, it seems that EVA particle production volume can satisfy demand from the module sector this year, but equipment maintenance and the pandemic will lead to an imbalanced supply-demand relationship in the short term.
Supply chain prices are expected to stay elevated and will not decline until the end of the year, when new polysilicon production capacities come fully online. Next year, the entire supply chain may hopefully recover to a healthy state, allowing the long-stressed module makers and system suppliers to take a deep breath. Unfortunately, striking a balance between high prices and robust demand continues to be major topic of discussion throughout 2022.
