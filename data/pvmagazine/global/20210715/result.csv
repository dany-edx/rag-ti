German storage system manufacturer Sonnen has published test results that indicate the longevity of its products after extended use. In laboratory tests, the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells, which are also used in the company's “solar battery,” reportedly withstood 28,000 charging cycles.
The lifespans of battery storage systems remain an issue for many potential buyers. Sonnen says that it has charged and discharged battery cells at a C rate of one and a depth of discharge of 100% over a period of eight years. This means that a full charge or discharge was completed within an hour. It noted that the test for the batteries was significantly more demanding than its use as a residential storage system.
Over the past few years, it has carried out tests in a laboratory operated by Sonnen in Wildpoldsried, Germany. According to the manufacturer, the iron phosphate battery cells still had 65% of their original capacity. As a result, the cells have not yet reached the end of their lifespans, because for this there must be a sudden drop in capacity, the manufacturer explained.
“The test results achieved so far go beyond the expected service life of the battery technology we use,” said Sonnen Managing Director Oliver Koch. “This is an important quality factor for our customers. And those who have a long-lasting battery also benefit economically for a longer period of time.”
Sonnen also tested modules consisting of 200 cells. It guarantees that the modules will retain 80% of their original capacity after 10,000 cycles. According to its latest tests, the modules retained 83% of their capacity over 10,000 cycles.
DNV GL presents its performance index for batteries, the Battery Scorecard, every year. In the last edition, it checked the cycle stability of various battery types. The company's experts determined how many cycles a battery had to go through to lose 1% of its capacity. The average was 381 for 22 manufacturers. For iron phosphate batteries, the range was between 135 and 448 cycles. For nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries, the range was 180 to 849 cycles for each percent of capacity lost.
If the same method is applied to Sonnen's test, a value of 800 cycles per percentage of capacity lost is obtained for the cell. The modules would have a value of 588 cycles.

The policy package – which refers to the raised ambition of reducing the EU's carbon emissions by 55% from their 1990 baseline level, by 2030 – was unveiled amid much fanfare yesterday, and included a recommendation by the European Commission that renewable energy generation account for 40% of Europe's electricity in nine years' time.
That would equate to a lot of solar capacity this decade, according to SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger, although not enough, she added, stating: “The European Commission’s proposed 40% renewables target would correspond to 660 GW [of] solar power installed by 2030, a huge number, driven by the versatility of solar and record-breaking cost reductions. No other energy technology is growing more than solar in Europe today which means that we can go even further, even faster. Our 100% Renewable Europe study with LUT [Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology] … demonstrates the most cost-efficient pathway to climate neutrality is a 45% renewables target by 2030, which would put the continent on track to deliver on the 1.5C Paris Agreement scenario.”
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry, looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights.

With time-consuming, complex permitting for solar plants an issue that has been raised by the industry again and again, the commission's Directorate-General for Energy pledged to produce guidance, next year, on how EU member state governments can help reconcile the need for clean energy facilities with environmental concerns and the interests of locals.
SolarPower Europe senior policy advisor Naomi Chevillard, said: “We are happy to see the European Commission address permitting, which continues to be a critical barrier to solar deployment today. The introduction of EU permitting guidelines are a necessary step to support this dialogue between the European Commission and member states, we therefore applaud energy commissioner Kadri Simson's confirmation that the European Commission Directorate-General for Energy (DG ENER) will issue guidance on ‘reconciling permitting with environmental and local communities interests,’ as of next year. If this fails to deliver, the introduction of a review clause for provisions on administrative procedures and permitting, constitutes a strong safeguard and should be mandated as soon as possible.”
Moves to make it easier to install solar on buildings have also been welcomed, with Miguel Herrero, a policy advisor to the European solar trade body estimating the potential for more than 580 GW of generation capacity from rooftop arrays owned by prosumers – homeowners and businesses which both consume solar electricity and sell excess to the grid.
However, more action could be taken, added Herrerro, who said mandating solar and energy storage for structures would be more effective than the indicative targets the EU intends to set for buildings and industry.
“Stronger action is needed to remove disproportionate administrative barriers on mid-sized self-consumption solar systems,” said Herrero. “Concrete measures are also needed to accelerate the deployment of solar PV on buildings. Exempting rooftop systems from construction permits and putting in place mandatory requirements to deploy solar and storage can unlock more than 680 TWh of renewable electricity, equal to 25% of EU electricity demand.”
The commission confirmed only renewables-powered ‘green hydrogen' could be considered as contributing to its 2030 emissions reduction target, and also suggested a requirement half of all hydrogen in industrial use come from clean power sources by 2030.
On that topic, chief executive Hemetsberger said: “The European Commission’s proposal to ensure that 50% of the hydrogen in industry is renewable by 2030, is a true game changer. This target, coupled with appropriate support measures, can create the market pull needed to accelerate the competitiveness of renewable hydrogen versus fossil-based solutions.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/15/supercomputer-scientists-dive-deep-into-perovskites/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JULY 15, 2021",Supercomputer scientists dive deep into perovskites,"The past year has seen much progress in the development of perovskite solar cells, with scientists working out new ways to delve deep within the materials and understand the interactions between particles, and how these serve to limit the conversion efficiency or cause rapid degradation.
And there is growing evidence that hydrogen bonds have a key role in limiting the formation of defects and ensuring stability and performance. New research led by the University of California Santa Barbara offers further evidence of this, finding that ‘missing’ hydrogen atoms, or vacancies, can occur deep within the material, causing dramatic reductions in cell efficiency.
To gain these insights, the group headed to the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)’s Cori supercomputer to model the path of electrons through a perovskite solar cell, using a technique called density functional theory (DFT). “DFT is a very powerful way to treat the behavior of electrons in a material quantum-mechanically,” said UCSB professor Chris Van de Walle. “It makes the problem feasible; but it still requires a lot of central processing unit (CPU) time.”
The group’s findings are described in full in the paper Minimizing hydrogen vacancies to enable highly efficient hybrid perovskites, published in Nature Materials. The group first modeled methylammonium-lead-iodide; one of the best performing and most commonly researched materials for perovskite solar cells.
The modeling demonstrated that hydrogen vacancies can form at high densities within this material, limiting the cell performance by causing high levels of non-radiative recombination. Meanwhile, modeling of another common perovskite material in solar cell research – formamidinum-lead-iodide, showed far lower levels of hydrogen vacancy formation, and lower non-radiative recombination.
With this knowledge, the researchers theorize that focus on perovskites based on formamidinum, rather than methylammonium, should be the direction of future research. “Our study unveils the critical but overlooked role of hydrogen vacancies in hybrid perovskites and rationalizes why formamidinum is essential for realizing high efficiency in hybrid perovskite solar cells,” the group states. “Minimizing the incorporation of hydrogen vacancies is key to enabling the best performance of hybrid perovskites.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/15/nanocomposite-films-for-13-57-efficient-organic-solar-cell/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MALAYSIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 15, 2021",Nanocomposite films for 13.57%-efficient organic solar cell,"A Malaysian research group has fabricated an organic solar cell by using the solution-casting method, with varying concentrations of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles in a matrix of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The solution casting method is commonly used for casting nanocomposite polymer films and consists of merging, equally, a polymer and a prepolymer and making them soluble in a suitable solution.
In the development of their cell, the Malaysian scientists used ZnO as a prepolymer to improve the mechanical, electrical, and optical characteristics of the PVA polymer, which was prepared by adding deionized water. They claim this is the first time that ZnO/PVA nanocomposite films, which are well known for their good optoelectronic properties, are used in organic PV cells.
Different samples of the solution were kept in an oven at 40 degrees Celsius and 60  degrees Celsius, for one and two days, respectively. The selected samples had a size of 130×60mm and a thickness varying from 0.025mm to 0.1mm. These were applied to a basic organic cell based on a Copper(II) oxide (CuO) layer and a carbon-doped zinc oxide (C-ZnO) layer.
The cell was tested outdoors under the direct solar heat of 32 degrees Celsius at noontime at a Malaysian location. These measurements showed that the optical direct bandgap of the cell decreased with the increase in ZnO concentration in the polymer matrix, which also meant a loss in efficiency for the whole PV device. “The thickness of the ZnO/PVA nanocomposite film also affects the efficiency of organic solar cells and the efficiency decreases with the increase in thickness of ZnO/PVA nanocomposite film,” the academics further explained.
The highest efficiency, of 13.57%, was found in the cell with the lowest concentration of ZnO, which was 14.25%, while the lowest efficiencies were reported for the cell with the highest concentration of ZnO. Before applying the film, the efficiency of the best-performant cell was 10.07%.
“The optimum drying time needs to be determined in order to obtain nanocomposite thin film with better physical and chemical characteristics,” the researchers affirmed, noting that future work should be aimed at improving the quality of deposition of ZnO/PVA nanocomposite film. “The applications for this cell are not defined yet. However, due to its strength, it can be used in automotive roof applications,” research co-author, Shaheer Ahmed Khan, told pv magazine.
The cell is described in the paper Performance investigation of ZnO/PVA nanocomposite film for organic solar cell, published in materialstoday: Proceedings. The research group includes scientists from the International Islamic University Malaysia.

The SEC chief was speaking at a two-day event organized by the Washington DC-based Global Solar Council which acts as an umbrella body for national solar associations.
Blume said Australia had witnessed 22% growth in its rooftop solar rate in 2019, with 2.2 GW installed; and that figure rose to 3.3 GW of rooftop panels last year with a further 30% rise in volume in the first half of this year.
The SEC president said the 40.5 GW of rooftop solar in Australia equates to 600 W of solar per person, per day, nationwide.
Stephan Singer, senior climate science and global energy policy advisor at the Bonn-based Climate Action Network group of civil societies, said it was time for the world's wealthiest countries to prioritize driving down emissions above ever-expanding GDP.
“Rich countries such as Germany, Belgium, and [other] countries in Europe do not need economic growth,” he told the two-day Global Solar Council event. “They need to learn to leverage on what they have and change from fossil fuels and nuclear to renewables and solar PV.”
The event was organized with the help of trade body SolarPower Europe and backed by EU investment entity Get.Invest.

The solar industry in Germany has been waiting eagerly for the results of the first tender for rooftop PV systems with a capacity of more than 300 kW. Six weeks after the deadline for submitting project proposals, the Federal Network Agency published the results.
The agency accepted to review 168 bids with a total capacity of 213 MW and selected 114 projects totaling 152 MW, which is 2 MW more than it planned to allocate. The final prices ranged between €0.0535 and €0.0789 per kWh and the final average price was €0.0688.
Furthermore, the German authorities reported that the tender for ground-mounted PV plants exceeding 750 kW in size has concluded with an allocated capacity of 513 MW and a final average price of €0.050 per kWh. The Federal Network Agency had received 242 bids totaling 1.13 GW and assigned 13 MW more than it had originally planned.
This year there is another technology-specific tender for each of the two photovoltaic segments. In the case of ground-mounted systems, the next key date is November 1, with a provisional capacity of 509.52 MW. The next round of tenders for roof systems has a planned capacity of 150 MW and will take place on December 1.

With trade body Solar Energy UK having long complained about the fact businesses can be penalized in that manner for installing solar, respondents to a survey commissioned by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) echoed the sentiment.
The results of the survey, published by BEIS on Tuesday, featured comments from the owners of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) including: “Are the government trying to help people or just make some money?” Researchers conducting the study noted: “There was palpable disbelief and anger when this issue was raised during the interview.”
Pick up your July copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at solar’s vital role in securing energy supply where conventional grids have struggled to reach. And don’t miss our In Conversation special: Over the past month, we have been in touch with leading researchers working on energy systems, solar cell technologies, battery storage, hydrogen and more; discussing the future of energy and the technologies we can expect to see a whole lot more of in the coming years.
By contrast, another bugbear frequently raised by the industry – of a potential rise in the 5% value-added tax rate applied to solar products – was considered of only marginal importance by SMEs mulling whether to go solar.
The survey staff, from London-based Basis Research, noted that, with finance having been available at historically low rates for years and the price of solar systems continuing to fall, investment was less of an issue than factors such as providing information about the benefits of solar panels.
With the U.K. government keen to burnish its climate change credentials ahead of the planned COP26 global meeting in Glasgow in November, giving solar a welcome nudge was well within the reach of policymakers, the researchers found. The study stated: “Given access to capital and financing is not a major barrier, creating a stable policy environment to plan both upfront costs and returns is entirely within the government’s control.”
In terms of the perception of the government, however, researchers reported a widespread impression Whitehall's commitment to solar has waned, with the emphasis on climate change having shifted to electric vehicles and household energy efficiency improvements and the dramatic wind down of the solar feed-in tariff (FIT) which occurred in 2015.
The results were compiled from an online survey of 889 households and from ‘in-depth' interviews with 15 SMEs in March. Businesses welcomed the 130% tax ‘super deduction' for the capital costs of installing solar which was announced in the national budget that month. Respondents said the scheme, which deducts 130% of the cost from tax bills, and which is due to expire in March 2023, had created a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to install commercial solar systems, which typically offer a return on investment of 5-10 years, according to the businesses questioned.
Researchers reported household solar systems could be bought and installed for less than £4,000 (€4,690) in the U.K., with the help of group buying schemes which enable large numbers of householders to aggregate bulk orders. Against that cost, there was little enthusiasm for the Smart Energy Guarantee (SEG) system which was introduced in January last year to replace the fixed FIT with a less generous, variable tariff paid for excess electricity sold to the grid by solar homes.
The report stated: “Attitudes suggest [the] SEG is not a significant incentive to promote the installation of solar.” With the SEG offering typical annual returns of £100-200 (€117-235) in the U.K., it is much less generous than its FIT predecessor but the government's desire to reduce public expenditure by winding down FIT payments was perhaps justified by the response given by one early adopter of commercial solar who said FIT revenue “remains one of the most profitable parts of their business.”
In terms of what would be needed to drive solar deployment, the survey said households wanted guarantees on the performance of solar panels, access to long-term payback schemes – perhaps tied to the property rather than the individual – and affordable energy storage or the ability to sell energy to the grid more profitably. The latter could be achieved, suggested the researchers, by tweaking the SEG to offer fixed payments for an introductory period.
Businesses also called for information on how to install solar and lists of approved solar panels and installers. Not surprisingly, they also wanted a guarantee their business rates would not rise as a result of investing in renewable energy.

Magenta Power, a Mumbai-based electric vehicle charging startup backed by Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. (HPCL), has opened India’s largest public EV charging station in Navi Mumbai. 
The facility was inaugurated by Maharashtra Minister of Industries and Mining Subhash Desai.
“Maharashtra has been in the forefront of EV development. Under our draft electric vehicle policy 2021, we aim to bring at least 1,46,000 new battery-operated electric vehicles on state roads by 2025,” said the minister. “We support our very own local startups like Magenta to drive the adoption of EV in the state and the country and soon globally.”
The first-of-its-kind Magenta public charging station will be functional 24-7. The station has four DC chargers of 15 kW to 50 kW of capacity and 17 AC chargers of 3.5 kW to 7.5 kW. The fast DC chargers can charge a vehicle in 45 minutes. A parking lots has also been developed to allow overnight charging of EVs via slow AC chargers. 
The chargers can be operated via the ChargeGrid App. The app allows online remote monitoring and includes an automated payment gateway. The chargers are powered by a combined 40 kW rooftop solar plant.
“The setting up of this public EV charging station in Mumbai is a revolutionary move to support the government initiative of setting up 400,000 charging stations to meet the requirement for 2 million electric vehicles that could potentially ply on its roads by 2026,” said Magenta. 
“Currently, as per EV industry body Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles, there are 1,800 charging stations in India as of March 2021 for approximately 16,200 electric cars, including the fleet segment.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/15/switching-from-subsidization-to-taxation-may-improve-uptake-of-heat-pumps-coupled-to-pv/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 15, 2021",Switching from subsidization to taxation may improve uptake of heat pumps coupled to PV,"A Swedish-Austrian research group claims to have demonstrated that the combined use of heat pumps (HPs) and rooftop PV generation may be expanded in their countries and in Europe by replacing current subsidies with a carbon tax policy.
According to them, switching from subsidization to taxation may be a feasible and simpler solution than the numerous incentive schemes that are currently being implemented across Austria. “The Austrian subsidization scheme for HP and PV systems are different for every state, creating confusion and inconstancy for potential adopters,” they warned in the paper Techno-economic analysis of combined heat pump and solar PV system for multi-family houses: An Austrian case study, published in Energy Strategy Reviews.
Through their analysis, which evaluated the lifecycle cost-effectiveness of the two technologies, the researchers sought to identify the most critical techno-economic parameters for profitability, which was determined by considering net present value (NPV); the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) which is given by the capital costs, subsidies and natural gas prices; and the internal rate of return (IRR). The assessment considered both air-to-water heat pumps (AWHP) and ground source heat pumps (GSHP) used for domestic hot water (DHW) and space heating (SH).
Their model also considered annual gas consumption, electricity supplied from the grid, and electricity fed into the grid by a south-oriented PV system mounted on a flat roof at a tilt angle of 42 degrees and occupying around 40% of the roof's available surface. “These inputs are estimations of the annual costs, savings and earnings, which are dependent on the O&M costs of the heat pump and PV systems; saved O&M of the gas heating system; and the gas price, electricity price and feed-in tariff,” the academics specified. “Together with the initial investment costs of the heat pumps and PV panels, the saved new gas boiler costs and the previously described energy results, the economic feasibility of replacing the conventional gas system with a combined heat pump and PV system has been estimated by calculating the net NPV, IRR and BCR.”
The techno-economic assessment showed, according to the scientists, that a drop in upfront costs for both heat pumps and PV may increase the BCR of this combination and, most important, that its profitability is strictly dependent on gas prices. “The parametric analysis shows that BCR is most sensitive to gas prices, where a modest 17% increase makes the combined heat pump and PV systems considerably more attractive, even without any subsidy,” the authors of the paper affirmed. “This increase in the gas price could be caused by market forces, introducing carbon taxes, or environmental or geopolitical reasons.”
They also noted that if this gas price increase would be combined with a decrease in electricity prices, the uptake of heat pumps coupled with solar may reach unexpected proportions. “A change in PV feed-in tariffs has not significantly influenced the profitability for the examined case,” they concluded.
The research group was formed by scientists from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology at Sweden's Department of Energy Technology, and the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/15/post-snec-market-demand-and-technology-trends/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,CHINA",,"JULY 15, 2021",Post SNEC: Market demand and technology trends,"From pv magazine 07/2021
Prior to SNEC 2021, China’s National Energy Administration issued a notice ruling that PV projects which fail to connect to the grid by the end of the year would be administered by the energy authority in each province and included in the guaranteed grid-connected capacity in the following year. This means grid parity projects approved earlier can postpone grid connection until next year.
In response to surging polysilicon prices, wafer prices rose again at the end of May to a level that was unbearable for cell and module manufacturers. Moreover, global module inventory has reached as high as 25 GW. These factors eased severe shortages and led to a pessimistic outlook.
Although grid parity projects are allowed to postpone completion, China demand will not see large impacts, as most projects are developed by state-owned companies working toward targets. In addition, residential projects that wish to earn subsidy payments contribute 15 GW to 17 GW of demand. In light of this, PV InfoLink slightly lowered its China demand forecast to 50 GW, but keeping global demand for the year at 155 GW, as the United States and Europe saw stronger-than-expected solar demand.
With global trends toward carbon neutrality and peak emissions, energy storage and hydrogen were buzzwords this year. At present, the cost per kilowatt-hour for energy storage is around $0.08-0.10. The United States, Europe and China, as well as other countries, saw increasing adoption of storage. More manufacturers introduced energy storage solutions than in previous SNEC years. Apart from lithium-ion battery manufacturers and large inverter manufacturers, vertically integrated companies including Jinko, Trina, Risen, Chint, GCL, and Haitai Solar also provided energy storage solutions.
On June 3, Longi signed a cooperation agreement with Tongji University, announcing their plans to establish a joint lab to focus on fuel cells. Longi also established Longi Hydrogen Technology Co. in March. On the same day, GCL signed a strategic cooperation deal with Siemens (China), Toshiba (China), CSSC Perry Hydrogen Technology, and Beijing Green Hydrogen Technology Development, signaling the company’s entry into the hydrogen industry. With the two wafer manufacturing giants leading the way, a new combination of “silicon, solar, hydrogen” has emerged.
Cell, module tech
SNEC saw most manufacturers showcase next-generation products ready to be commercialized. In large formats, PERC modules mostly feature 550 W to 660 W, while small format modules rated at 400 W to 450 W were introduced for the rooftop sector. The 210 mm n-type modules can reach a power output of 700 W. Manufacturers also promoted smaller n-type modules rated beyond 400 W for the rooftop sector.
In terms of wafer sizes, Longi, Jinko, and JA Solar continue to promote 182 mm modules. Trina showcased 210 mm modules only. Canadian Solar displayed both 210 mm and 182 mm PERC modules, as well as 182 mm HJT modules. Risen is sticking to the 210 mm format.
Module manufacturers showcased high-density module assembly, including narrowed-spacing and tiling. It’s worth noting that, prior to SNEC, Longi released a white paper on “smart soldering” technology. JA Solar, on the other hand, introduced gapless encapsulating technology, indicating developments in string welding techniques.
In terms of cell technology, Longi launched the Hi-MO N series, its first modules with TOPCon cells. Trina and Canadian Solar unveiled their HJT modules for the first time this year. Risen introduced its New “T@N” technology – an n-type cell concept that combines elements of both PERC and HJT.
Whether leading module manufacturer Longi can commercialize its new TOPCon modules and optimize costs will largely impact the pace of TOPCon development next year. At present, required capex for 1 GW TOPCon is $38.4 million to $48 million, which is not significantly higher than $24.7 million to $30.2 million required for 1 GW PERC equipment. Moreover, TOPCon can be an upgrade from existing PERC production lines.
Many new PERC lines installed this year have been earmarked for upgrade to TOPCon, meaning capacity expansion and production of TOPCon will surpass that of HJT next year. However, HJT equipment costs fell markedly this year, from $96 million to $110 million to $54.8 million to $61.7 million per gigawatt, and are moving toward the $48 million range.
HJT manufacturers are also working to optimize the cost of silver paste and other materials. HJT will continue cost optimization this and next year. Most manufacturers will focus on improving technology with pilot lines instead of expanding capacity, and so the production output will be lower than TOPCon.
Price trends
Polysilicon prices rose from CNY 150/kg ($20.60) at the beginning of May to CNY 200/kg at the end of the month, sending modules rated beyond 500 W up to more than $0.25/W. Such a price level is unacceptable for developers and EPC companies. Combined with a surge in ocean freight rates, inventory draw has significantly weakened amid shrinking profits.
With China’s installation rush cooling and low global module demand in the July-August period, manufacturers cut output in June to an average utilization rate of 40% to 60%. This stopped the rise of polysilicon prices, with prices staying at CNY 200-220/kg. As Longi did not release new pricing in mid-June, the upward trend for wafer prices has stabilized.
Looking ahead, prices are not likely to fall in the short term due, to unbalanced supply and demand of polysilicon. Module prices may remain at $0.24-0.25/W. If the price level is accepted in China after recent negotiations, and most projects connect to the grid this year, a new price balance point will be set. However, module prices may be turbulent in July and August, when demand slackens.

Spark Renewables, an offshoot of Spark Investment, plans to develop a 2.5 GW hybrid wind, solar and battery storage project near Jerilderie, New South Wales.
The site for the proposed Dinawan Energy Hub is on the route of the planned AUD 2.28 billion ($1.7 billion) Project EnergyConnect, the high-voltage electricity transmission interconnector stretching between New South Wales and South Australia. Spark Renewables said the hub is also strategically positioned in relation to the proposed HumeLink, a 500 kV transmission upgrade to increase transfer capacity from the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme and the VNI West interconnector.
The company, which owns the 100 MW Bomen Solar Farm near Wagga Wagga, said the hub would generate enough electricity to power more than 1 million average Australian homes per year and significantly offset the impact of coal-fired power station closures in New South Wales.
Anthony Marriner, head of renewables at Spark Renewables, said that the proposed project is in the early stages of planning. Work is set to commence on preliminary studies and consultation in the coming months.
“We are only at the start of the development process and the proposed project must undergo a rigorous planning and assessment process which includes environmental studies,” he said. “We are also committed to extensive community and stakeholder consultation to identify the possible environmental, economic and social impacts, as well as opportunities and mitigation measures.”
While there are no significant commitments in place, it is anticipated that construction of stage 1 of the Dinawan Energy Hub would begin in 2024, with the first operations to commence in 2025.

Spark Infrastructure Managing Director Rick Francis said the hub will serve as a “cornerstone project” in the South-West Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) and will accelerate the development of new renewable generation in the zone.
“It will unlock significant renewable generation capacity consisting of wind, solar and battery energy storage across (New South Wales) in the coming years, providing resource diversity to renewable generation planned in the other REZs,” he said. “This proposed major new renewable project further underpins the need for new and expanded high-voltage transmission links within (New South Wales) and to Sydney which are crucial as the energy transition continues to accelerate in our quest for a sustainable energy future for Australia.”
The Dinawan Energy Hub is part of a major shift for Spark, which owns 49% of the major network operators in Victoria and South Australia and a 15% stake in New South Wales transmission network operator Transgrid. The company is now targeting more than AUD 1 billion of investment in renewable energy generation by 2025.
The Bomen Solar Farm, which went online last year, was the first renewable energy asset in Spark’s portfolio. But the company said it has a ~2.2 GW development portfolio of wind, solar, storage and green hydrogen projects. This includes an 60 MW extension planned for the Bomen Solar Farm, as well as an unidentified 150 MW solar+storage project and a 350 MW wind farm in New South Wales, along with a massive 600 MW wind farm project in South Australia.
“We are evaluating further opportunities for Bomen Solar Farm, including storage,” Francis wrote in the company’s annual report. “Other areas we are exploring include wind, solar and storage projects.”

Researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have made a chemical breakthrough that they believe will allow electric vehicle batteries to hold almost twice the energy of their traditionally used lithium-ion counterparts.
The solution in question is a lithium-metal chemistry with an energy density of 350 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg), which is on the higher end of the spectrum, but not entirely in a league of its own. The chemistry also has the added advantage of being much lighter than traditional lithium-ion chemistries.
These aspects of lithium-metal are not new, however. What is new is the resilience of the battery. Historically, lithium-metal batteries have been plagued by premature death, with previous record holders accomplishing just 200 cycles before seeing significant drops in capacity.
The chemistry developed by the PNNL team was able to maintain 76% of its initial capacity after 600 cycles, blowing the old record out of the water. There is still work to be done for sure, as currently used EV batteries typically last for around 1,000 cycles.
