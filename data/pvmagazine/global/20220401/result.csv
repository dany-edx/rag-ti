As one might expect, the discussions soon became political, as both private and public representatives debated the simultaneous need for more support and less red tape. 
They took the summit as an opportunity for discussion and to workshop ideas for the commission’s pending solar strategy. But of course, the Russian invasion and the ongoing war in Ukraine was at the top of every discussion, with a particular focus on the way in which solar and renewables can detach Europe from its dependency on Russian fossil fuels.
In her opening remarks, European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson said the summit comes at a “critical” juncture for the continent.
“The energy world has changed drastically in recent weeks,” said Simson. “The events in Ukraine remind us of an uncomfortable truth: we are too reliant on Russian fossil fuels. And as long as we continue like this, we are not fully in control of our energy future. That needs to change. This is not a new priority. It’s a new sense of urgency.” 
Reliance on Russia
At the top, SolarPower Europe CEO Walburga Hemetsberger asked how Europe can become independent as quickly as possible. But former energy engineer and European Parliament member for Renew Europe, Emma Wiesner, may have put it best in the opening session when asked just how soon Europe’s extrication from Russian dependency could take place.
“How soon? I would say ‘yesterday.' But obviously it is very hard to change pipelines overnight,” said Wiesner. “What is missing from the current discussion in the EU is that we are still financing the war through our energy payments. We (Renew Europe) are asking for an import ban as soon as possible, but that is currently missing from European leadership. It will be an enormous challenge for the energy landscape but we have the means to do it.”  
Wiesner said Europe needs to confront the problem along three time dimensions. In the short term, the European Union needs to be looking for new partners. Over the medium term, it is preparing for the next heating season. And over the long term, Wiesner said that Europe’s energy strategy needed to be “totally reshuffled, off gas and toward renewables.”
She noted that storage would be key. “It is not being scaled at the rate we need. We need to increase storage capacity,” she said.
Throughout the summit, a clear line was drawn between the need to reduce Europe’s dependency on Russian fossil fuels and the rapid acceleration of renewables uptake. As the European Investment Bank’s (EIB) head of renewable energy, Alessandro Boschi, put it, “we are in a unique moment to push for more … there is a sense of priority now, because now we are not just talking about energy security but real security.” 
Solar scale-up
“We want maximum solar as soon as possible,” said Mechthild Wörsdörfer, deputy director general of energy for the European Commission, in a discussion of the EU’s Solar Strategy.
But how much in 2022? That was the question Hemetsberger put to the audience in a poll. The majority said that the middle-of-the-road 39GW target is achievable, but much more conservative than the EU’s new dream target of 57GW. From the perspective of the European Parliament, Wiesner said it is “very worrying” that “a room full of experts” don’t think 57GW is possible this year. She ultimately noted that “better policies” are required. 
However, Megawatt-X Managing Partner Laurent Segalen said that solar doesn’t need subsidies. “We need to lose our shackles,” he explained.
Segalen pointed to Texas and Australia – two sunny regions whose governments are “climate deniers.” But solar is flourishing in both places without government interference, he claimed. And Segalen’s wish for a more deregulated market, in order to allow renewables to achieve rapid scale-up, was not an isolated one. 
Rooftop primacy 
Unlike Australia and its expansive renewable energy zones, Europe has few sparsely populated areas, let alone lots of areas with significant irradiation. This is why most indsutry observers agree that Europe’s priority should be the rooftop. 
“According to some estimates, solar rooftops could provide almost 25% of the EU’s electricity consumption,” said Simson. “This is more than the share of natural gas today.” 
Simson noted that the installation sector is struggling to find enough skilled workers, but the commission is determined to help with that. “Our solar strategy will cover this point,” she said. “But I also know that you need the skilled workers now, not in four or five years.” 
Many countries were already dealing with a massive worker shortage, particularly for installers, in the renewable energy industry. Schmela noted that in some markets, including Poland, “many of the installers were Ukrainian and have now returned to fight.” 
Wörsdörfer, meanwhile, said the industry also needs to make green jobs more economically attractive.
Innovation imperative
However, when it came to the need for a much stronger, more sustainable EU manufacturing market, there was broad consensus.
“We don’t want to go from one dependency (Russia) to another (China),” said SolarPower Europe Director of Market Intelligence Michael Schmela. That said, the European Commission’s Director for Mobility and Energy Intensive industries, Joaquim Nunes de Almeida argued that “security of supply is something that will be with us for years to come.”
Nonetheless, Almeida said that everyone is on the same page when it comes to recognizing the direct link between European manufacturing sustainability and European security. “The more we decarbonize, the more resilient we become,” he said. 
Everyone agrees that European manufacturing will not be able to compete with Chinese competitors on price. Instead, Europe’s strength is innovation. “I think it’s about new technology if Europe is going to get back in the game,” said Boschi, “it requires innovation.”
Enel Green Power CEO Salvatore Bernabei said that Europe must be the first mover on new technology. “Finally we have understood we can’t have dependency,” he said.
However, Wacker Chemie AG's polysilicon division president, Tobias Brandis, warned about problems ahead if a sustainable European manufacturing chain isn’t established.
“We are stepping right into the next dependency” said Brandis. “Now is the window … We need to be bold … we don’t expect prices to mirror western China, but we need a decent energy price that is reliable.” 
Diego Pavia, EIT InnoEnergy’s CEO, argued that there is consumer appetite in Europe for premium European products. “We will never be able to compete with China on cost,” said Pavia. “But the demand side is willing to pay a premium for EU manufacture … there is appetite.” 
Permitting problems
“Permitting is the elephant in the room,” said said SolarPower Europe Director of Market Intelligence Michael Schmela.
And indeed, it is an elephant few knew how to handle. The permitting process should take approximately two years, but in a lot of member states, the time frame is typically three to five years. That said, European Commission Head of DG Energy Lukasz Kolinski argued that “most barriers are at the national level.” 
Alexandre Roesch, CEO of France’s Syndicat des Energies Renouvelables, agreed that member states haven’t stuck to the the two-year timeline.
“Probably because they can’t deliver, and this is for lack of human resources,” said Roesch. “We are far too understaffed in the office in charge of permits, it’s a national issue in France.” 
SolarPower Europe submitted its own proposal at the event as the European Commission prepares its new solar strategy, which will be released in the coming months. But what was clear from the conclusion of the SolarPower Summit 2022 event is that Europe’s energy future rests on the dual pillars of sustainability and security.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/01/sunpower-in-late-stage-discussions-with-first-solar-to-produce-tandem-solar-modules-with-tandem-technology/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 1, 2022",SunPower in late-stage discussions with First Solar to produce solar modules with tandem technology,"From pv magazine USA
Evolving from a single-product company, SunPower is now moving to provide the “full energy product eco-system” by providing storage, EV charging, smart home solutions. And soon SunPower will offer choices in solar modules. SunPower CEO, chairman and director, Peter Faricy, announced its new partnership with First Solar, calling it “Tandem Technology” that will combine First Solar’s thin-film semiconductor design with crystalline silicon. The stacked tandem solar module could be available to customers as soon as 18 months.
The design differs from traditional silicon or thin film modules, using two different photovoltaic absorbers to harvest more energy. SunPower says that it will be the most sophisticated technology commercially available to residential customers and that it will significantly raise the bar for solar module efficiency and aesthetics.
Meanwhile, SunPower has ambitious plans for the residential market, having recently sold its Commercial & Industrial Solutions (CIS) to TotalEnergies, majority owner of SunPower. In November of last year SunPower hinted at its move away from commercial and more deeply into residential. In February of this year, the company signed the definitive agreement with TotalEnergies, and confirmed that SunPower was putting its eggs in the residential basket
“The sale enables SunPower to focus on creating a superior residential experience, increase our investment in product and digital innovation, and reach more homeowners,” said Peter Faricy, CEO of SunPower.
In the analyst briefing, Nate Coleman, chief products officer, said that having a diverse panel offering would help First Solar reach more residential customers. He stated that the company plans to make solar available to 100 million homes (or more), and that by introducing new products the company will maintain its #1 position. “We expect to obtain the same market share in the mainstream market as we currently have I premium segment over an approximate 6 quarter ramp,” said Coleman.
Coleman also presented the new SunVault whole home backup solution. SunVault Storage, in the form of 26 kWh and 52 kWh configurations, allows the system to provide customers with backup power for every device in their homes in the event of an outage.
SunPower CEO Peter Faricy kicked off the analyst day presentation saying that by 2026 100 million homeowners will save money with solar. He noted that the two factors working in favor of this growth are increasing utility rates and the positive outlook for clean energy policies. Because policy changes have yet to go into effect, Faricy said that SunPower wouldn’t see a “deal progression” until late in Q2 or early Q3 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/01/the-mobility-revolution-second-life-battery-applications-with-pick-n-mix-cells-connected-in-series/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,HIGHLIGHTS,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"APRIL 1, 2022",The mobility rEVolution: Second-life battery applications with ‘pick-n-mix’ cells connected in series,"Connecting and operating very different cells as desired in second-life applications referred to as patchwork batteries could soon become a viable option thanks to a novel technology developed by Germany-based Benning CMS Technology. By virtue of its patented algorithm embedded in the charging process called ETA-Leveling, battery cells from different manufacturers, of different ages and at different nominal capacity can be connected and operated in a series. During charging, the algorithm treats each cell as if it were part of a single-cell battery application, thanks to efficiency leveling. Through targeted correction of the conversion efficiency, all cells connected in series are levelled so that they all have a uniform overall efficiency and thus achieve the end-of-charge voltage at the same time. “Up until recently, we ourselves would’ve never thought that combining cells randomly would work. It has not been possible with any of the traditional BMS [battery management systems],” says Frederik Fuchs, managing director of Benning CMS Technology. “Manufacturer, age, nominal capacity, cell chemistry – it really doesn’t matter. Our leveling process also recognizes which cells are a reasonably sensible match based on their capacities. We then combine these cells to a long-lasting battery block that works perfectly.” The company confirms for pv magazine that patchwork batteries with different cell chemistries have been limited to the demonstration phase, whereas in all other cases the systems work seamlessly with same chemistry cells from different manufacturers, of different ages and at different nominal capacity. As such, the technology could potentially unlock massive opportunities for reusing discarded battery modules that tend to end up on landfills due to prematurely aged cells. Whereas these weakest cells determine the capacity of the entire block, most of the cells in the discarded block are still in excellent condition or at least too good to recycle them. According to the company, ETA-Leveling can also be used as a BMS in the first place to prevent the premature ageing of cells as well as in defective blocks, where it can best re-level the cells so that the block can continue to be used. Already available for licensing, ETA-Leveling is suitable for battery blocks of all kinds – including all EV and stationary storage applications — and it requires no hardware changes.
In the UK, the EV charging network is in for a major boost. This week, energy company bp announced new plans to invest £1 billion ($1.3 billion) in the rollout of ultra-fast charging stations across the country, and thus approximately triple the number of public charging points in its network. The investment will be made over the next 10 years helping to meet the fast-growing demand for EV charging in the country. It will allow bp to deliver 300kW and 150kW ultra-fast charging points that are able to provide EV drivers up to 100 miles of range in around 10 minutes of charging, depending on the model of electric vehicle, and to launch new home charging products and services.
For successful decarbonization of road transport, a full variety of charging locations is crucial. In what has been dubbed the UK’s most ambitious workplace EV charging rollout, charging infrastructure provider EO Charging and energy service provider eEnergy plan to install at least 50,000 charge points for EVs at schools, colleges and universities by 2030. The first 200 installations will be completed this month and at least 2,000 chargers will be installed within the first 12 months. The latest figures from the Department for Transport show that while there are now more than 250,000 home charging devices in the UK, only 2,038 devices have been installed through the government’s on-street charging scheme since it was established in 2017, meaning those without off-street parking are being left behind. The latest announcements align with the British government's plan unveiled last week to install 300,000 charge points by 2030 on the back of a £1.6 billion ($2.1 billion) investment.
Meanwhile, in Germany, Volkswagen is weeks away from finalizing plans for a €2 billion ($2.2 billion) EV factory where it hopes to bring notable innovations in range, charging speed and digitization. The new manufacturing facility for the Trinity electric model is to be built close to the main plant in Wolfsburg. Production of the Trinity electric model from 2026 on will be net carbon-neutral and will set new standards in autonomous driving, electrification and the digitization of mobility, according to Volkswagen. “Our goal is clear: we want to set the standard with our production,” Volkswagen brand production chief Christian Vollmer told Reuters in an interview. “If we can get to 10 hours, we have achieved something big.” By means of comparison, Tesla says it can already build a Model Y at its new Giga Berlin factory in 10 hours, while the German carmaker currently needs three times as long for its ID.3 electric car. As the electric overhaul of the German automotive industry picks up pace, the arrival of Tesla has created an even bigger sense of urgency and Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess has warned Germans must speed up to avoid getting beaten on their own turf.
Some 50 kilometers from the Acrtic Circle in Sweden, British luxury automaker Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has got a step closer to launching its first all-electric vehicle, Spectre, after completing winter testing in temperatures as low as -40℃. The carmaker has shared that the Spectre has now covered 25% of the planned 2.5 million test kilometers, simulating 400 years of use on the new EV. Its first all-electric vehicle will be by far the most technologically advanced and connected Rolls-Royce ever, and will align with the prophecy of an all-electric future of one the company's founders, Charles Rolls. “The electric car is perfectly noiseless and clean. There is no smell or vibration. They should become very useful when fixed charging stations can be arranged,” Rolls said back in 1900.

According to the researchers, the electrochemical pump can work at temperatures of 200 to 250 degrees Celsius, “20 to 70 degrees higher than other high-temperature-PEM-type electrochemical pumps, which improves its ability to separate hydrogen from the unwanted gasses.”
Meanwhile, scientists at the University of Aberdeen in the United Kingdom are starting a £250,000 research project that aims to achieve “a world first” by using a plasma electrolyzer to convert carbon dioxide into hydrocarbons for energy use. “Through this process, they will aim to create an electrochemical reaction by applying a voltage between two electrodes in a weakly ionized gas, resulting in the reduction of CO2 and the oxidation of hydrogen. This combination of plasma-catalysis and electrocatalysis could allow the use of renewable electricity generated by renewable sources to power a plasma electrolyzer, in an entirely new process that would efficiently convert CO2 back to hydrocarbons, reducing CO2 emissions as part of a circular economy model,” the University of Aberdeen wrote on Thursday. The project, led by Angel Cuesta Ciscar and Panagiotis Kechagiopoulos, is one of ten projects announced on Thursday by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) to achieve a net-zero society by 2050.
The Brunel University London aims to develop a new type of liquid ammonia blended with hydrogen that can overcome incomplete combustion and poor engine performance when ammonia is used in combustion engines. The team led by Xinyan Wang focuses on marine vessels and long-haul vehicles.
Another project led by Loughborough University’s Wen-Feng Lin aims to use seawater to store renewable energy. “This project aims to deliver on this ambition by overcoming challenges to the development of seawater electrolysis, which uses renewable energy to split seawater into oxygen and hydrogen gas,” UKRI wrote. A fourth project led by Cardiff University’s Marc Pera Titus aims to develop redox flow batteries “that use and reuse H2 carriers without the need for toxic or expensive components.”
Munich-based Siemens Energy announced it would start producing Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) hydrogen electrolyzers in Berlin. “Start of production at the location Huttenstrasse in Berlin’s Moabit locality is scheduled for 2023,” the company said on Thursday, explaining that the  first gigawatt production beginning in 2023 was part of a broader plan for a multi-gigawatt factory. Siemens Energy will use an existing production hall that is currently manufacturing gas turbines. “New production lines for the electrolyzers are being set up on 2,000 square meters at a cost of around €30 million.” According to the German company, the electricity used in electrolyzer manufacturing will be sourced entirely from renewables.
Oslo-based Nel Hydrogen Electrolyser, a subsidiary of hydrogen solutions company Nel, has received a €3 million order for an alkaline electrolyzer system “from an undisclosed European customer to provide green hydrogen to the European market.” In Thursday’s press release, the company did not clarify the delivery period. Earlier in March, the company received a €2 million order for an alkaline electrolyzer system from Solar Foods, with delivery due in late 2022 or early 2023.
Dutch energy company Eneco joined the NortH2 green hydrogen consortium as an investment partner, while Dutch producer and distributor of hydrogen-based products OCI teamed up with NortH2 as a collaborative partner. “These two partnerships underline the need to move quickly towards integrated development for the entire green hydrogen value chain,” wrote NortH2 on Thursday. Eneco, which is aiming at climate neutrality by 2035, plans to make further investments in green hydrogen, alongside NortH2, the company wrote in its press release. “With ~50% of current global hydrogen production already used as a feedstock in ammonia and methanol production, the switch to green hydrogen at OCI is technologically straightforward and relatively fast when compared to other sectors,” OCI wrote. NortH2 is a large-scale offshore wind-to-hydrogen electrolysis project being developed in the Eemshaven area. Eneco, Shell, Equinor, and RWE want to produce a large-scale supply for the industry of up to 4 GW by 2030. During its current feasibility phase NortH2 consists of Equinor, RWE, Shell, and Gasunie with the support of Groningen Sea Ports.
The German Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association (DWV) will receive €1.4 million in funding for the HyMobility innovation cluster, which aims to create a network and an innovation platform to promote hydrogen mobility and boost confidence in zero-emission vehicle technology using hydrogen. The association will propose regulatory measures. “Thanks to the financial support for the HyMobility innovation cluster, we are able to create a network for the exchange of knowledge and experience between the areas of H2 production, vehicle manufacturers and users, and infrastructure. In this way, we are linking players along the entire value chain,” commented DWV Chairman Werner Diwald, underlining the importance of hydrogen for heavy-duty transport. The HyMobility project is being funded by the German Federal Ministry of Digital Affairs and Transport as part of the National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Innovation Program.

The company wants to invest around $1.9 billion in the capacity expansion plan that will be implemented in two 16GW phases by the end of 2023.
State-owned China Energy Engineering had 953MW of solar generation capacity last year, annual figures released on Wednesday indicated. A 413-page annual report gave details of under-construction PV projects including a 500MW, RMB1.65 billion (US$260 million) site in Shahe; a 120MWp, RMB488 million (US$76.8 million) facility in Yanchi; a 100MW, RMB423 million (US$66.6 million) plant in Hainan; a 50MW, RMB208 million (US$32.7 million) scheme in Wulan County; and two projects of unspecified scale – one of them agrivoltaic – with budgets amounting to a further RMB559 million (US$88 million). The engineer posted profits for shareholders of RMB6.5 billion ($1.02 billion) last year.
State-owned solar panel glassmaker Irico New Energy on Tuesday raised RMB9.15 million (US$1.44 million) by selling its 39% stake in quartzite mining and kyanite and silica ore processing company Hanzhong Jiarunze to the Irico Import & Export business owned by Irico Group, which is itself owned by China Electronics Corp. On Wednesday, the glassmaker published annual accounts showing PV panel products supplied RMB2.05 billion (US$323 million) of its RMB2.07 billion (US$326 million) revenue as the business posted a net profit for shareholders of RMB163 million (US$25.7 million), down from the RMB202 million (US$31.8 million) banked in 2020. With the manufacturer investing in new production lines, the company's bank balance fell from RMB718 million (US$113 million) at the end of 2020 to RMB702 million (US$110 million); long term borrowings rose from RMB230 million (US$36.2 million) to RMB472 million (US$74.3 million); and spending on construction last year came in at RMB531 million (US$83.6 million), up from RMB368 million (US$57.9 million) a year earlier.
State-owned manufacturer Luoyang Glass said it “ignited for production” the first phase of a solar cell packaging materials manufacturing facility on Tuesday. The fab is being developed by Luoyang’s NBM (Tongcheng) New Energy Materials Company Limited unit. The China National Building Materials Group-owned business did not issue any more details about the site but did publish its 2021 results on Wednesday. The 13.6 million square meters of solar panel glass made by Luoyang last year generated RMB2.75 billion (US$433 million) of the company’s total RMB3.6 billion (US$567 million) revenue for a solar glass trade net profit of RMB220 million (US$34.6 million). Total net profits for shareholders fell, though, from RMB373 million (US$58.7 million) in 2020, to RMB265 million (US$41.7 million) last time out. That was in part down to RMB1.69 billion (US$266 million) paid out for construction last year, up from RMB238 million (US$37.5 million) in 2020, and because a debt reorganization in 2020, which brought RMB29.5 million (US$4.64 million) of benefits in that year, saved Luoyang only RMB382,000 (US$60,100) last year. Nevertheless, the glassmaker’s end-of-year cash pile sat at RMB1.12 billion (US$176 million) at the end of December, up from RMB338 million (US$53.2 million) a year earlier.
The government of Yunnan Province announced a plan to deploy another 50GW of PV over the next three years. Through the plan, the provincial government will combine solar with wind power, hydropower, coal power, and battery storage.
Solar module manufacturer JinkoSolar announced it will supply up to 1GW of its n-type Tiger Neo panels to CNNC Rich Energy Corporation Limited. The company said it had shipped over 2 GW of this kind of advanced N-type panels since its first launch in November.
PV module maker and solar developer Risen Energy announced on Thursday it sold a 50MW solar plant in Suzakskyi District, Turkestan Region, Kazakhstan, to a unit of China's largest nationally-owned energy enterprise, the State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC). The plant was sold for $32.8 million.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/01/the-solar-tech-check-key-takeaways-from-siliconpv-2022/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",MARK HUTCHINS,"APRIL 1, 2022",The solar tech check: Key takeaways from SiliconPV 2022,"A sunny spring morning in Konstanz, and a building famous for the settlement of a 15th Century dispute between three men all claiming to be the legitimate pope, provided the setting for this years’ siliconPV Conference. Just over 300 people had registered for the event, with 182 making the journey to Konstanz (43% of these coming from elsewhere in Germany), and another 129 joining virtually from all over the world. pv magazine was in attendance, and as the last of the related workshops draws to a close this afternoon, we offer the following takeaways from the event.
A significant chunk of the research presented this week has focused on the metallization and transparent conductive oxide areas of cell production, which typically involve the use of silver and indium, respectively.
The latest n-type cell technologies, heterojunction in particular, require considerably more silver than earlier generations of cell technology. And as solar manufacturing continues to scale, consumption of these materials becomes ever more problematic. University of New South Wales scientist Brett Hallam outlined these issues clearly in work to be published later this year, under the title “Roadmap towards sustainable HJT solar cell design”, outlining the pros and cons of various approaches including thinner TCO layers and replacing silver screen printing with copper plating.
And there was plenty of innovation in these areas on show throughout the conference: TU Delft researcher Can Han presented work on a heterojunction cell stack without a TCO layer, and Stefan Janke of Helmholz Zentrum Berlin joined the conference virtually to share work on aluminum-zinc oxide as an indium free alternative, finding that some indium might still be needed to ensure stability, but combining ITO with AZO could reduce indium consumption by at least 80%.
On the silver side, several approaches to copper plating were shown during the week: Including one from Sven Kluska of Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, which also found that copper plating in TOPCon potentially allows for other improvements to the cell stack, including a thinner polysilicon layer. And Katharina Gensowski of the same research institute presented a “filament stretching” approach that could greatly optimize the use of silver, reducing the consumption per line from 1.9mg to 0.7mg.
Understanding the role of hydrogen atoms in various mechanisms at work within a solar cell has long been a challenge for researchers, and one that has changed with every new development in solar cell technology.
The ability to detect hydrogen and know exactly what it is doing is still high on the list of things PV scientists need – it is known that the presence of hydrogen has both positive and negative effects, but more understanding is still needed to be able to engineer out the negatives and optimize the positives such as improved passivation and performance regeneration after light-induced degradation.
An entire session on the first morning was devoted to this, and the work presented found that hydrogen’s role in heterojunction cells may be quite different for PERC or TOPCOn. And work presented by Abigail Meyer from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Lab/Colorado School of Mines used a technique called electron paramagnetic resonance to confirm hydrogen’s involvement in the light-elevated temperature induced degradation (LETID) mechanism.
As a solution to light-induced degradation (LID), cell manufacturers have begun using gallium rather than boron as a dopant. And since the industry has been relatively quick to adopt this approach at scale, work is still ongoing to fully understand other implications, beyond the removal of the boron-oxygen complex that causes LID.
A presentation from University of Manchester’s Tarek Abdul Fattah spoke of silicon PV “moving into the gallium era”, and noted that the annual ITRPV report – an oft-cited source this week – forecasts 100% of cells to use gallium doping by 2031.
Abigail Meyer’s work also confirmed that LETID can still happen in gallium-doped wafers, and that here as well hydrogen is somehow involved. Elsewhere, work has revealed that the presence of gallium can lead to a material defect, but not in a configuration that causes recombination or performance losses, and that a degradation mechanism related to gallium could potentially be permanently deactivated via heat treatment.
Though the conference is still called SiliconPV, this year it dedicated an entire morning to tandem cell technologies, placing a perovskite cell on top of the silicon. Stefan de Wolf, professor at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, started the day off with an invited talk outlining some of the impressive achievements, and the challenges still in the way for tandem cells.
With the two cells on top of each other and connected in series, much of the discussion in this session focused on the need for accurate current matching between the two cells, and the ability to tell when one is limiting the other, and which one is doing the limiting. A presentation from Fraunhofer ISE’s Alexander J. Bett found that under red light perovskite tends to be the limiting cell, while it is the other way under blue light. And the tunability of perovskites will provide the solution here. Several scientists advocated ‘bromide lean’ perovskite solutions with a bandgap of around 1.64 electron volts as optimal for current matching with a silicon cell.
Those working on perovskites in particular are often keen to speak of silicon coming close to its limit in terms of performance. However, the work on show this week reveals there is plenty more to be done in terms of understanding and optimizing the minuscule processes going on inside a solar cell: as we saw with new work on light soaking in heterojunction cells – able to bring about a “0.4% absolute efficiency gain in one second”, according to Oxford University’s Matthew Wright.
And there is a wealth of materials seldom seen in silicon cell production that have also shown potential worthy of further investigation, as seen in Tuesday afternoon’s session on passivating contacts and the presentation of both aluminum-doped zinc (from Bart Macco of Eindhoven University of Technology, and silicon carbide (presented by Ezgi Genç of École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne), as possible new assistants in the search for better performance at lower costs.

Their work sought to assess, in particular, how a rooftop PV array may potentially decrease the cooling burden for an average middle-income household dwelling in Amman, Jordan. They used the IES-VE software, which is commonly used to create and capture performance information during the design, commissioning, and operation of a building in order to analyze the thermos-physical performance of the uninsulated roof under the shade of a PV array. “The essential aim was to minimize cooling load while observing the difference in the heating load after installing the PV system as a shading device only, without accounting for the electrical generation of the PV system and maintaining thermal comfort under new circumstances,” the research team specified.
The Revit 2020 software for building design was used to build the baseline simulation model. Their analysis was applied to a single-storey residential building with an overall size of approximately 180 m2. “The building is oriented so that the axis of rotation is aligned to the south-north direction,” the academics explained. “There is no shade from the outside or elements that block the sun from entering the house, which allows a significant amount of energy to pass through.”
The research project took place during the heating period spanning November 2021 to April 2021 and the cooling period from May 2021 to October 2021. The PV system was designed to cover 4.9% of the roof surface area. The total installed power of the building was 480 kW.
Through their simulation, the scientists found that the shade effect of PV panels may reduce the building's cooling demand by 10.87%, which means a lower power consumption of 136.6 kWh for the cooling months. “Conversely, PV panels increased the heating load in the winter by 3.8%, which means that the rise in heating loads in heating months was 175.3%,” they also explained. “A rooftop PV system provides a greater understanding of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy demand variance in buildings which is critical in modern architecture.
Their findings were presented in the paper Rooftop photovoltaic system as a shading device for uninsulated buildings, published in Energy Reports. The research group comprises scientists from German Jordanian University, the An-Najah National University in Palestine, and the University of Almeria in Spain. “The scope of this work can be expanded to include other climate areas, types of roof construction, the electrical integration of a PV system to estimate overall energy consumption and a comparison should be conducted between horizontally mounted photovoltaics panels and tilted panels in terms of electrical generation and shading effect,” they concluded.

The French Ministry for Ecological Transition published the results of the “Etude friches” (Wasteland study) in early March, which identifies the list of wastelands in industrial and urban areas that could be suitable to host large-scale PV installations.
A total of 859 sites have been identified and their locations and characteristics are available on the ministry's website (section Etude friches).
The data comes from public databases and feedback from regional authorities and municipalities.
All the listed locations are categorized as degraded sites, which offers some advantages in the tenders for utility-scale PV projects held by the French energy regulator.
In 2019, the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (Ademe) published a report which described the solar energy potential of neglected surfaces and parking lots in mainland France and Corsica, in addition to 17,764 related sites that could host PV plants.

It said it aims to set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) with a joint venture partner under the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC) in Bangladesh under the Companies Act, 1994.
The SPV will arrange debt financing for the project, conduct feasibility studies, select an EPC contractor, oversee generation, handle O&M, and sell the electricity from the project. Prospective partners should be solar developers with at least 50 MW of cumulative, grid-connected PV capacity within the last five years. 
Applicants should also have an average annual turnover of at least $30 million over the past three years, said RPCL. The final date for expressions of interest May 12. Commercial operations have been scheduled for December 2024.
RPCL said it eventually aims to install up to 300 MW of renewables capacity throughout Bangladesh. It is currently working on a 100 MW Solar power plant in Jamalpur district.
Bangladesh currently generates about 780 MW of electricity from renewable sources, with about 300 MW  of solar installed by the end of 2020, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The nation aims to produce 40% of its energy from clean sources by 2040.

Enel announced that it had secured an undisclosed amount of funding for the Tango (iTaliAN pv Giga factOry) project in mid-November. “The 3 GW production facility is expected to be fully commissioned by July 2024, after starting with the first 400 MW in September 2023, making 3Sun Europe’s largest gigawatt-scale factory producing high-performance bifacial PV modules,” the company said in a statement.
The funds were provided by the European Commission under the framework of the EU’s first Innovation Fund call for large-scale projects.
Enel plans to invest around €600 million in the expansion of its module manufacturing facility and the European Commission will contribute around €118 million to the total sum.
“Europe alone is expected to absorb a large portion of additional demand thanks to the great competitiveness and convenience of this technology,” said Enel CEO Francesco Starace. “The sourcing footprint of these important components is a weak point in the global supply chain and we see the need to rebalance its geographic spread that is today excessively dependent on a single Asian source.”
Enel started production at the 200 MW facility in October 2019. It invested around €80 million in reviving the factory, which was built in 2011 with Japanese electronics manufacturer Sharp and French-Italian semiconductor business STMicroelectronics. Enel took full control of the facility in July 2014. At the time, the factory was intended to produce multi-junction, thin-film silicon PV modules.

Their proposed methodology focuses on the cultivation of olives, almonds, peaches, cherries, apples, and pears.
“This agricultural model would make it possible to reconcile tree cultivation with agrivoltaics, until now limited to low-rise crops such as cereals or lettuce,” the scientists said. “This circumstance could be of great interest in countries where agriculture is one of the fundamental economic activities.”
Their model specifically applies to an existing PV plant with horizontal trackers on a north-south axis, with hedgerow trees between the module rows. Under the proposed system configuration, the tracking systems would improve power yield by eliminating the shadows of the crops on the solar panels.
The Spanish group identified an ideal geometric space between the module rows for crops to avoid affecting the irradiance capture or the tracking strategy. Through a tracking-backtracking algorithm, the team was able to find the most suitable solar module tilt angle for different solar array configurations.
“It is recommended that the manager of any PV plant with N-S solar trackers, following the proposed methodology, obtains the corresponding isolines of radiation losses,” the academics said. “Thus, based on this graphic, the PV plant manager can evaluate the convenience of converting a PV plant to an agrivoltaic plant with hedge crops also oriented in the N-S direction.”
They simulated the proposed approach for an agrivoltaic plant with north-south horizontal single-axis solar trackers and an olive grove in a hedge in Cordoba. They said they were able to improve the land equivalent ratio (LER) by between 28.9% and 47.2%.
They presented their findings in “Design and analysis of a tracking/backtracking strategy for PV plants with horizontal trackers after their conversion to agrivoltaic plants,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy.
“Progress achieved in this study (is) very significant as the natural evolution of the implementation of PV power plants with single-axis trackers will force, over the coming years, the search for solutions to their conversion to agrivoltaic facilities,” they concluded.

The figures showed that 2021 was the country’s best for solar deployment yet, with around 500 MW of new capacity added to the grid. The nation installed 400MW in 2020, 287MW in 2019, and 180MW in 2018. Sweden now boasts around 92,360 PV arrays, with about 26,500 added last year. In 2020, newly deployed installations stood at around 22,000.
Energimyndigheten reported that more than 50% of the deployed PV system have a capacity of less than 20kW and that installations ranging in size from 20kW to 1MW have a 42% share of the total. Solar parks with a capacity of more than 1MW account for around 8% of the country's total installed solar capacity.
Most of Sweden's PV capacity is represented by residential and commercial arrays that were supported by a rebate scheme. The Swedish Energy Agency has devoted around SEK 4.8 billion ($511.2 million) to the solar rebate program for the 2009-21 period.

Sterling and Wilson Solar has warned Australia that it faces a shortage of skilled talent to work on projects.
The India-based EPC contractors has a global portfolio of more than 11GWp. Its Australian EPC order book includes five major solar PV projects with a cumulative total of more than 1.1GW, including Neoen’s 400MW Western Downs Green Power Hub in Queensland and the 174MW Wellington Solar Farm being developed by Lightsource BP in New South Wales.
It is also constructing the 162MW Columboola and 120MW Gangarri solar farms in Queensland, and the 150MW solar component of the Port Augusta renewable energy park in South Australia for Iberdrola.
Sterling and Wilson Solar Australia Chief Executive Philip Sheridan said the labor shortage is one of the key challenges confronting the industry and it is putting the development of new large-scale solar farms under strain.
“Securing skilled labour is certainly an area which is proving challenging,” he said. “The issue is not unique to the renewable sector but we are struggling to find the resources to service the projects and not it’s just the blue-collar workforce but white collar as well. And to be brutally honest it is only going to get worse.”
Independent advisory group Infrastructure Australia has described the growing skills shortages as “a public infrastructure workforce crisis”.
In its first Infrastructure Market Capacity report, the group project managers will struggle to recruit skilled workers for one in three industry jobs by 2023, the equivalent of 105,000 positions. Of particular concern for the clean energy industry is a shortage of engineers, electrical line workers, electricians and skilled wind power technicians.
Sheridan said the skilled labor shortage has been an issue in Australia for many years and the pandemic has exacerbated the problem, with both state and international border closures preventing the arrival of much-needed expertise at some renewable energy projects. He also said the surge in the size and scope of proposed large-scale solar projects has added an extra element to the equation.
“The pipeline of opportunities that we are aware of today with the targets that are being talked about for 2025 and 2030 and the types of projects we’re seeing in the longer term, these are GW projects … the numbers are huge,” he said. “The numbers that are being bandied about, 10GW, 15GW … these are big set-ups. On paper it looks very good in terms of opportunities but it’s not just the project but how it’s going to be serviced. The industry really has to change and evolve from where we have traditionally been to ensure they can be executed.”
Sheridan said it is incumbent upon the industry to adapt to circumstances, pointing to opportunities to develop modular construction techniques and increase off-site building to potentially reduce the on-site labour component.
“We need to be developing smarter ways to deliver these projects,” he said. “I think the less labor-intensive elements we can do in the field potentially the less people we require out there. Simplifying some of the activities might make things more streamlined.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/01/new-solar-trailer-bus-from-sono-motors/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",RYAN KENNEDY,"APRIL 1, 2022",New solar trailer bus from Sono Motors,"From pv magazine USA
Sono Motors, an electric vehicle maker with a focus on integrating solar PV with transportation, has deployed its solar technology on the municipal bus fleet in Munich, Germany. The buses will be attached with a trailer that is topped with 20 semi-flexible solar panels.
The modules cover an area of 12 square meters and supply the 24V battery with more than 2,000W. In the pilot, the solar energy will be used to operate the HVAC system and support the trailer steering system. This saves the bus from burning diesel and stabilizes the battery’s energy supply, which lowers maintenance costs and extends battery lifecycle.
The PV system was custom-built for the needs of buses, and features the company’s proprietary maximum power point tracker (MPPT) unit and an algorithm-enabled charge controller designed to optimize energy production. Production can be tracked online through integrated software.
After technical approval by the supervisory authorities, the bus trailer will go into regular service, providing cleaner transportation for Munich residents.
“We need a change of course in the transport sector. Transport still misses the climate protection targets by a very wide margin, and this also has a direct impact on air quality in Munich. The solar buses can be a cornerstone in this urgently needed change towards climate-friendly mobility,” said Katrin Habenschaden, Munich vice mayor.
The company said a medium-sized fleet of 300 buses could save about 2,000 metric tons of C02 emissions each year. When considering the 1.5 ton C02 emissions “backpack,” or the amount of emissions related to producing the bus trailer, the carbon impact of production would be offset in less than one year of operation.
Sono Motors said its solar technology has been designed so that it can be integrated with a large range of vehicles. E-buses can be integrated with PV on their roofs and sides, extending range, reducing standstill times for charging processes, and protecting the battery for a longer life through steady power cycling.
“Especially in times of rising energy prices and increasing urban area emission regulations, our solar technology offers great added value for public transport operators. City buses and coaches, whether electric or diesel-powered, offer a lot of space and are out on the road every day. The first solar bus trailer for MVG will hit the streets of Munich in the future and allow MVG passengers to experience solar mobility in daily use,” said Laurin Hahn, co-founder and CEO of Sono Motors.
Sono Motors is also developing its own passenger vehicle, the Sion. The Sion sports a liquid cooled battery with a 54kWh battery and a 190 mile range and has 248 solar cells seamlessly integrated in the roof. The PV on the roof can add between 70 to 150 miles per week to that range.
The car can be charged 80% in 35 minutes via a fast charger, and is capable of public charging, at-home charging, and can exchange power vehicle-to-vehicle. Preorders are available in the German market. Sono said the former SAAB plant that will be used to produce the Sion will be powered by 100% renewable energy.
