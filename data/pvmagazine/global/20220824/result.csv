The provincial government-appointed Independent Electricity System Operator (Ieso) says rising electric vehicle adoption and planned nuclear reactor retirements will ensure it needs to commission 5 GW of new electricity generation capacity.
As part of that effort, Ieso has approved 55 applicants to compete in a fast-track procurement competition designed to secure 1 GW of new generation plants by 2025 and a separate call for proposals to commission 2.5 GW worth of facilities by 2027.
With 77 applicants having been part of the initial round of both procurement exercises, Ieso has qualified 55 companies including Amp Solar Group; Brookfield Renewable Power; French-owned EDF Renewables Canada; China-backed Portuguese utility EDP Renewables Canada; Enbridge Inc; NextEra Canada Development; Renewable Systems Canada Inc; Samsung Renewable Energy; Japanese-Indian entity SB Energy US Holdings; and Spain's Acciona Energy Canada Global Inc.
The list of approved bidders includes “a significant number of potential energy storage projects,” according to trade body the Canadian Renewable Energy Association.
Ieso has stated its fast-track procurement – termed an ‘expedited process' – will be open for proposals from December 20 and the electric market operator expects to award contracts from February 28.
The 2.5 GW exercise – a first long-term request for proposals, or LT1 RFP – is set to be open for submissions by July with contracts awarded in October next year.

Panasonic announced a new set of warranty terms for its solar and energy storage products. The coverage, called the EverVolt AllGuard All System warranty is a comprehensive warranty covering product, performance, and labor across major system components. 
This includes 25 years for Panasonic solar panels, 25 years for racking systems, 10 years for inverters, and 10 years for Panasonic EverVolt 2.0 energy storage system. Panasonic’s solar technology is backed by 40 years of research and development.
“With the EverVolt AllGuard All System Warranty, we can uniquely provide homeowners a broader range of protection that covers their entire solar and energy storage system to enhance their investment. Home battery storage is gaining popularity among homeowners looking for independence from the power grid and is now an integral part of the solar electricity system. With our warranty covering product, performance output, and parts and labor, they can rest assured that their solar energy investment will be fully protected.” said Mukesh Sethi, director, solar and energy storage, Panasonic Eco Systems 
To qualify for the warranty, the equipment must be installed by a Panasonic authorized solar installer or authorized EverVolt storage installer. The inverter warranty is solely for Enphase microinverters purchased from Panasonic, and the racking warranty applies to Unirac and IronRidge racking systems. 
EV battery factory 
Last month, Panasonic announced it plans a $4 billion U.S. electric vehicle battery factory in Kansas City. The Kansas Department of Commerce and the Kansas City Area Development Council and its partners shared that the company’s plans create a need for up to 4,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs. Panasonic has identified a site in De Soto, Kansas for the project, pending approval by Panasonic’s board of directors. 
“With the increased electrification of the automotive market, expanding battery production in the US is critical to help meet demand,” said Kazuo Tadanobu, president, CEO of Panasonic Energy. “Given our leading technology and depth of experience, we aim to continue driving growth of the lithium-ion battery industry and accelerating towards a net-zero emissions future.”  
More than 1 billion customers use Panasonic products every day, generating 86 million tons of CO2 emissions based on electricity consumption figures. This amounts to approximately 110 million tons of CO2 emissions across our entire value chain, a number that is equivalent to about 1% of total emissions from global electricity consumption. The company has entered an initiative to become net-zero in its business operations by 2030 and sets further goals for its sustainability by 2050.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/24/perovskite-silicon-tandem-single-cell-solar-module-with-26-2-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SAUDI ARABIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 24, 2022",Perovskite-silicon tandem single-cell solar module with 26.2% efficiency,"Scientists led by Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have fabricated a monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem photovoltaic device which they claim shows minimized cell-to-module losses.
The device is based on a tandem solar cell with an area of around 1 cm2, based on an n-i-p perovskite stacked on top of a silicon heterojunction, which the same researchers unveiled in December 2021. The single-junction perovskite sub-cell was built on a substrate made of glass and an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, an electron transport layer (ETL) made of the 2PACz carbazole additive, the perovskite layer, lithium fluoride (LiF), a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
The first attempts to put the cell into a module configuration resulted in an efficiency drop from 28.9 to 25.7%, which the academics attributed to a 1.7 mA/cm2 drop in short-circuit current density from cell (19.6 mA/cm2) to module (17.9 mA/cm2). “The reduction in efficiency is due to a refractive index mismatch after the introduction of glass and the polyurethane directly on solar cells without cell-to-module optimization, which resulted in enhanced reflection of the incoming light,” the research's corresponding author, Lujia Xiu, told pv magazine. “We decided to reduce this front reflection loss through an optical redesign of the module through refractive-index engineering.”
The research team moved the magnesium fluoride (MgF2) anti-reflecting coating used for the cell from the top of the cell to the top of the module front glass, which they said resulted in a reduction of the front reflection. “As a result, the tandem short-circuit current density increases by 0.7 mA/cm2 (from 17.9 to 18.6 mA/cm2) in the new configuration, enabling a monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem module power conversion efficiency increment from 25.7% to 26.2%.”
The Saudi group introduced the cell in the study “Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Photovoltaics with Minimized Cell-to-Module Losses by Refractive-Index Engineering,” published in ACS Publications. “We now hope to explore how different materials and texturing the material surface could reduce the current losses from cells to modules even further,” said Xu.
The same research group recently announced an inverted perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell with a 1 nm thick interlayer based on magnesium fluoride (MgFx) placed between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL), in order to reduce voltage losses.

Mumbai-headquartered Waaree Energies has secured approval for the maximum module capacity by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) for use in government-backed projects. The approval covers projects planned to sell electricity to government entities.
The MNRE’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) features 18.05 GW of capacity from 28 manufacturers, including 4.75 GW per year from Waaree alone, or about 26% of the total. Out of 4.75 GW, Waaree has 2.65 GW enlisted for high-wattage modules (540 W, 600 W, and 650 W). It is also the only manufacturer to have 650 W modules listed under the ALMM.
Waaree currently operates four PV module manufacturing facilities in India, in Surat, Chikhli, Tumb, and Nandigram. It has shipped solar modules to customers in 19 countries and has been ranked as a Tier-1 PV module manufacturer by BloombergNEF (BNEF) for four consecutive years, from 2018 to 2021. Recently, it was recognized as a top performer in PV Evolution Labs’ (PVEL) 2022 PV Module Reliability Scorecard.

“Gallium-doped cells protect the module from light-induced degradation, ensuring a power loss of less than 2 percent during the first year,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “Multi-busbar design improves module efficiency by minimizing the amount of current flowing between the fingers and the busbars, which reduces resistive losses.”
Dubbed SS8-72HS 530-555M, the new product is available in six different versions with a power output ranging from 535 to 555 W and a power conversion efficiency between 20.5 and 21.5%. The open-circuit voltage spans from 49.31 and 50.03 and the short-circuit current from 13.73 to 14.07 A.
The panel measures 2,279 mm x 1,134 mm x 35 mm and has a weight of 27.5 kg. It also features an IP68 enclosure, 2 mm tempered glass and can operate with a system voltage of either 1,000 or 1,500 V. The panel has a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per C and its operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
The new product comes with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 2.0% and 25-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 84% of the nominal output power.
Solarspace announced in July a deal with the government of Chuzhou, Anhui province, for a 16 GW solar cell manufacturing facility. The factory will be built in two 8 GW phases and produce cells based on 182 mm and 210 mm wafers. The manufacturer has currently a cell production capacity of 30 GW and 4.5 GW of module production.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/24/taiwans-thingnario-delivers-pv-production-insights-from-3200-pv-sites/,"SPONSORED,TAIWAN",,"AUGUST 24, 2022","Taiwan’s thingnario delivers PV production insights from 3,200 PV sites","Thingnario’s report, titled “Taiwan PV Performance Report,” presents its insights courtesy of over 100,000 IoT devices including inverters, power meters, pyranometers, weather stations, and more, and covering 45% of the new installation market in Taiwan. The total weight of the data totals more than 273 terabytes.
While the report focuses on avoiding losses, other interesting data nuggets emerge: although Taiwan covers just 394km from north to south, southern Taiwan has most of the island’s solar plants to avoid more persistent clouds and rain in the north. 
The report focuses more on recoverable energy losses, which averages 2.16% of all energy generated per plant. It shows at least one-third of the losses can be fixed through monitoring and swift, proper O&M, says thingnario.
The report also looks at avoidable, recoverable losses and quantifies what those are. Identification of the avoidable losses comes from separating recoverable and unrecoverable losses, the latter of which is not considered in the report. These losses are considered irreversible, and relate to module losses and orientation, ohmic losses in wiring, inverter conversion losses, and so on.
Recoverable losses are further addressed. These losses are then split between availability, referring to complete losses due to entire equipment failures or outages, and performance losses. Performance losses are down to equipment effectiveness and inefficiencies, where maximum efficiencies are maintained through better maintenance and control. An example is if a fan on an inverter fails, or the inverter overheats. This is recorded as a performance loss, given these losses are able to be rectified through correct management namely quality monitoring and proper maintenance.
Thingnario’s data points to better outcomes for solar parks with proper O&M. The report suggests that performance losses in particular, can be minimized via monitoring systems that combine with data analysis, providing both accurate and instant notifications, followed by rapid action from qualified maintenance teams.
The company suggests that using its own AI monitoring system combined with a well-trained and responsive O&M team, helps save US$4,200 per 1 MW. That figure comes from data suggesting that the average downtime for equipment repair sits at 123.6 hours. However, a better O&M team can reduce that downtime to 52.1 hours. In turn, on average, that helps to reduce recoverable losses to only 2.16% of all generated energy.
Per megawatt, the losses on average are 29,3768 kWh, but a better O&M performance can reduce this average to 8,475 kWh, a 70% saving.
General PV plant availability can be analyzed through inverter, MPPT, and string downtime monitoring. However exact performance losses remain complicated to evaluate, with production data unable to tell the full story. Thingnario’s approach is to use AI to understand the amount of electricity that is being lost and where improvements can be made, by learning patterns and comparing the real-time performance and real-time environmental changes.
Thingnario developed deep-learning algorithms that discover different kinds of on-site, and sometimes hidden abnormalities. The system can calculate the possible loss, and immediately inform the O&M team of the issues. The process is improved further by the learning system collecting swift feedback from the O&M team, creating an iterative system that keeps the algorithm upgrading and evolving. In turn, this provides an accurate, comprehensive analysis of the performance and abnormal issues.
Taiwan’s high feed-in tariff rate (FIT) has previously insulated domestic PV sites from significant losses from poorer O&M practices. FITs started as high as $0.35 per kWh for small scale roof-top solar, and $0.25 for ground-mounted utility scale solar installations. However, with lower FITs now taking over, priced at around $0.14 per kWh, PV site monitoring is now much more important, and monitoring is the first step towards actionable management, via correct and transparent information.
William Kao, COO of thingnario, noted the transition catching out some PV investors. “The energy revolution is happening now,” he said. “It is vital to pay our attention to know how to utilize each equipment we invest in for renewable energy at this critical turning point year.”
The moves in Taiwan to reduce FITs follow similar situations in Australia, UK, and Germany, which reduced large-scale PV tariffs in 2011 following drastically decreasing costs for PV installations and caused shifts in operational approaches.

Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have released a study which examines “the technical outlook, economic feasibility, and environmental impact of battery-electric containerships.”
Breaking from previous studies, the researchers have classified the volume of space housing the batteries as an opportunity cost, rather than a fixed technical constraint. After modeling a wide variety of containership sizes, as well as 13 major world trade routes, the research suggests that more than 40% of the world’s fleet of containerships could be electrified “cost-effectively and with current technology,” by the end of this decade.
TCP (total cost of propulsion) by ship type, route length, current (a) and future (b) battery pricing:

In graph ‘a’, (above left), the authors show the current viability of containership electrification, based on ship size and length of voyage. The gray and white areas of the graphs represent the shipping routes where the electrification of containerships would immediately lower shipping costs.
Using only technology available for purchase today, nearly all ships with routes shorter than 2,000 kilometers are economically advantageous, and ships with routes as long as 3,000km are economically viable.
Graph ‘b’, (above right), projects that price reductions to “near future“ battery technology are expected to roughly double the economic viability and range of electrified containerships.
Crucially, this research demonstrates that electrified containerships have an economic advantage over the internal combustion engine (ICE), even when the costs of environmental and health damages are excluded.
The differences in TCP are contrasted in graph ‘a’ (ICE) vs graph ‘b’ (electrified):

The authors present estimates of air pollution damages and the social cost of carbon for both ICE, (above left), versus electrified containerships, (above right). The gray bars in the chart above show that ICE containerships cause damages equal to or greater than three times the ship’s costs.
An electrified containership will also cause some environmental damage, however, the estimates of an electrified ship’s air pollution, and the social cost of carbon, are only 1/12th that of an ICE ship.
In a future in which the costs of large ICE containerships will continue rising, as electrified containerships become increasingly cost effective, the authors posit that ICE ships (below, left) will be grossly more expensive than electrified containerships (below, right).

The authors show that at current battery prices, the electrification of trade routes less than 1,500 km is economical, and has minimal impact to ship carrying capacity. And when the authors include environmental costs, the economical range skyrockets to 5,000 km.
A 5,000 km containership would require approximately 6.5 GWh of LFP batteries.
The average cost of lithium-ion batteries has plummeted 89% since 2010, and is expected to reach $50 per kWh in the near future. Assuming a battery cost of $100 per kWh, the TCP for a battery-electric containership is already lower than that of an ICE equivalent, for routes less than 1,000km. And when battery prices reach $50 per kWh, which is predicted for the near future, electrified ships will be cost-effective on routes as long as 5,000km.
The key technical constraint for battery-electric container shipping is the volume of the battery system and electric motor relative to the volume occupied by a vessel’s existing engines, fuel storage and mechanical space. The extra weight of the BES system is, however, non-trivial in determining a vessel’s power requirements.
Battery chemistry is another key factor in configuring electric cargo ships. Vessels that take short, frequent trips have lower power requirements, but would need to recharge quickly. These vessels should benefit from the high charge rates and long life cycles of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Long range ships already spend more time docked in each port – typically well over 24h – and could take advantage of the relatively low cycle life and high energy density of nickel manganese cobalt oxide batteries.
The Yara Birkeland is an 80m long, 7MWh electrified autonomous containership that can hold 120 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), which makes 12 nautical mile trips.

For ‘Neo-Panamax’ containerships, (sized to fit through the Panama canal), routes less than 3,000km actually require LESS space for batteries and motors than the volume currently occupied by combustion engines and fuel tanks.
If this class of ship were to travel 20,000km on a single charge, the batteries and motor would require 32% of the ship’s carrying capacity, or 2,500 TEU.
We find that as carrying capacity increases, the percentage of total carrying capacity volume occupied by batteries decreases because larger ships typically have lower energy requirements per unit of carrying capacity.
The charging infrastructure for a containership traveling less than 10,000km can be accomplished using less than 300 MW. Containerships holding 1,000-3,000 TEUs typically spend an average of 31 hours waiting in line and berthing. The largest ships, holding 10,000-20,000 TEUs, spend an average of 97 hours waiting and berthing.
The infrastructure required to support such massive charging capacities is surprisingly affordable, largely due to the efficient logistics of ports, since berths are typically occupied more than 50% of the time. At 50% utilization, the researchers modeled that the levelized cost of a 300MW charging station comes to mere $0.03 per kWh.
None of this technical viability would exist if it were not for recent and ongoing improvements to batteries, inverters and electric motors. For instance, in their models, the researchers assumed ICE “tank-to-wake efficiency” of 50%, and electric motor and inverter efficiencies of 95% each. Electrified containerships are 80% more efficient than their ICE counterparts, and use 30% less energy overall.
For inquiring minds: one gallon of heavy fuel oil (HFO) contains approximately 150,000btu, equivalent to roughly 44kWh. But since even the most efficient internal combustion ship engines are no more than 50% efficient, a gallon of HFO produces no more than 22kWh of actual propulsion. Most modern electric motors are now over 90% efficient, and the most advanced prototypes are approaching 99% efficiency.

With solar eclipsing coal as the lead source of electricity generation in Australia these last days, the question of how to manage this powerful but unpredictable fleet is already a pressing issue.
While working at IBM, Julian de Hoog, Peter Ilfrich and Maneesha Perera – cofounders of startup Solstice AI, saw industry was crying out for accurate numbers on particular area’s solar systems and, more importantly, their expected generation over any given day.
It is this need Solstice AI hopes to fill. “We’ve developed this AI [artificial intelligence] model where, with very high accuracy, you can go and find all the solar on the rooftops,” de Hoog says.
To be specific, the accuracy sits at over 97%, with the model able to differentiate between exporting solar systems and solar hot water systems. It also integrates whether the systems are north or east facing – revealing whether they will capture the morning or afternoon sun.
With that model already built and working, the team is now integrating it with real-time cloud movement from satellite images. Currently working with one hour forecasts, the model uses the information from these two datasets, along with some other minor metrics, to create a forecast of the output of all solar systems across a region, as well as individually.
“The reason we got involved in this is that I’m not aware of anyone doing both together,” de Hoog says.
The most promising use case for such forecasting will happen when distributed storage becomes more widely integrated, de Hoog says. “Then you can start to manage your scheduling of your energy storage in response to your forecasts.”
In other words, once more community and household batteries are installed on low voltage networks, many of the issues surrounding the unpredictability of rooftop solar fleets can actually be managed locally by integrating forecasts with energy management software and AI technologies, rather than needing to call to centralized generators.
“In a way, some of the solutions we’re building right now, we’re aware that it will take a year or two before they’re needed – but at that point we’re hoping they’ll be proven,” de Hoog says.
The company is currently looking at creating one hour forecasting, but de Hoog acknowledges it is probably more valuable to go up to three, six, and 24 hours so energy markets have more time to respond.
“We’re actually still working on answering that question [of forecasting timeframes] and figuring out what we should be targeting to add the most value and create the most useful solution,” de Hoog says.
“The reason we’re looking at this short term forecast is that it might be enough to prepare gas-fired peakers to respond to that, it would help to keep the market from going all over the place. But another part of it may be that we’re still developing the solar imagery forecasts and one hour ahead is pretty good but once you start getting to 24 hours ahead, forecasting the clouds becomes quite difficult,” de Hoog says.
Both de Hoog and his cofounders have previously worked on day ahead forecasting. Far from being overjoyed with that meteorological data, the company is currently using data from stationary satellites which take images of their regions every 10 minutes.
While developing the technology, de Hoog says the team realized that just knowing where solar is can be quite valuable. For instance, that data can be used for electric vehicle uptake, since householders with solar are more likely to invest in an EV.
In terms of the forecast solution though, de Hoog says it is really for anyone exposed to wholesale prices, including generators, retailers with buying flexibility, and network operators.
It could also be useful for companies involved in aggregating solar and storage fleets through virtual power plants (VPPs).
“If you can forecast [solar’s part] of the energy mix better, it helps you forecast price better, which helps you bid more strategically – which, I believe, helps everyone start bidding a bit more intelligently and forecasting total net demand more accurately and the whole thing becomes more stable.”
Currently, the company is looking at using a subscription-based model for its products, though this is still to be finalized.
Australia leads the world in the rollout of rooftop solar, which means many of the issues already being encountered here – including problems around voltage control and two-way energy flows in local networks – are still some years away for the rest of the world.
“If we can solve these problems in Australia today, we’ll be ready for all these other markets when they start to have these issues,” de Hoog says.
The CEO recently relocated back to his home country, Canada, after living in Australia for many years. While his co-founders remain in Melbourne, the move, he says, helps open the startup up to its ultimate target markets in the US and North America – which have far greater populations.
“Solar is the fastest growing form of energy generation and anybody who looks at the projection of where solar is going, is going to realize there’s going to be so much of it and we’re going to have so many challenges to integrate it all and we need to address these now. And there are also real opportunities there from a business point of view.”
Solstice AI is currently working with a cohort of other companies on the ARENA-funded Project EDGE (Energy Demand and Generation Exchange). The project is developing a Distributed Energy Resource (DER) Marketplace which operates assets like rooftop solar and batteries to provide both wholesale and local network services, using different metrics from a VPP.
Solstice AI is working on the forecasting side of the project, controlling fleets to respond to constraints of the local transformers and feeders.
The company was also recently selected as one of ten startups in EnergyLab’s 2022 cohort for its Climate Solutions Accelerator program.

Mississippi Silicon is a silicon metal facility that was launched in 2015, which the company says is the first in North America in forty years. The facility produces silicon metal, a semi-conductive metalloid element that serves as a crucial component in thousands of products, from electronics to steel to solar to automotive.
“Mississippi Silicon was founded nearly ten years ago to be a domestic source of high-quality silicon metal to the US solar, electronics and chemical industries,” said Eddie Boardwine, CEO of Mississippi Silicon. “We are pleased by the growing recognition of the importance of a strong end-to-end US supply chain for these materials. Passage of the SEMA Act makes bringing that supply chain to reality. We look forward to working with REC Silicon to strengthen our existing relationship and build out that vital supply chain.”
Recent investment by the Hanwha Group into REC Silicon, in conjunction with Hanwha’s subsidiary Qcells, positions REC to expand its relationship with Mississippi Silicon, which supports the development of an end-to-end U.S. solar supply chain from raw silicon, to polysilicon, and finally fully assembled modules.
In June, REC Silicon and Ferroglobe signed an MOU with the plan to develop an end-to-end US solar supply chain from raw silicon, to polysilicon, and finally fully assembled modules. Ferroglobe is a producer of silicon metal and its alloys and it supplies critical materials for many industrial and consumer products, from silicones to solar power cells, from steel to aluminum to foundry components.
The recent Hanwha investment will enable a re-start of the currently idle Moses Lake plant in 2023 and make available high volumes of cost competitive, high quality, and low carbon solar grade polysilicon. REC Silicon has an annual production capacity of more than 20,000 MT of polysilicon from its two U.S.-based manufacturing plants in Moses Lake, Washington and Butte, Montana.
“As previously announced, REC is working hard to drive large-scale investments to develop a robust solar supply chain in the US. In line with REC’s endeavors, we applaud the efforts and determination that were needed to realize the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act,” said James A. May II, CEO of REC Silicon. We are hopeful that with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act which includes SEMA, the entire solar supply chain in the US will be fully established and placed in a position to flourish.”

The London-based policy group in July published figures indicating Japan generated more than 10 TWh of solar power in May, up from the previous record of around 9.5 TWh in April 2021; and South Korea hit around 3.25 TWh of solar in May, up from the previous month's 2.8 TWh.
Those output records amounted to 15% and “more than 7%” of national electricity generation, respectively, according to Ember, which was formerly known as Sandbag.
The figures illustrate how far each nation has to go in the energy transition, according to Ember, which lobbies for the switch from coal to clean power.
The not-for-profit said Japan generated 68% of its electricity from fossil fuels last year, with the same sources supplying 56.2% of South Korea's electricity.
In Japan's case, that compares with 9.8% of electricity from solar last year, Ember said, with the government working on a new coal power plant in Taketoyo, central Japan.
Japan has the world's fourth largest solar fleet, according to Ember, and South Korea the ninth biggest but the latter nation still only generates around 4% of its electricity from solar, even if the volume of solar electricity has been rising steadily since November.
Aditya Lolla, Ember Asia's senior electricity policy analyst, quoted on the thinktank's website, said: “Solar’s continued growth in Japan and South Korea represents a positive sign in moving towards a more sustainable, affordable, and secure energy supply. The added capacity has been especially valuable recently but both countries have a lot more potential they need to tap into.”
