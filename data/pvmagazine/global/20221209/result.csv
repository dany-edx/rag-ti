Greenko has won 3 GW of energy storage capacity from NTPC Renewable Energy, the renewables unit of Indian state-owned power producer NTPC. It won the capacity by quoting the lowest bid in the technology-agnostic storage tender.
Greenko is developing the world’s largest energy storage platform based on pumped storage technology. It now has 50 GWh of storage projects under development. With its latest tender win, it will provide 500 MW/3,000 MWh of standalone storage capacity for a period of 25 years to NTPC Renewable Energy. NTPC Renewable Energy will use the storage capacity to supply round-the-clock power to utilities and industrial customers.
The tender outcome establishes pumped storage technology as the preferred and lowest-cost long-duration energy storage solution. Other developers submitted bids for Li-ion batteries, Na-S batteries, and compressed-air storage technologies.
“The winning bid translates into unit storage charges of $58/MWh on a single cycle per day basis, a remarkable feat in view of the storage charges discovered in another recent energy storage procurement tender based on battery energy storage systems by SECI ($120/MWh),” said Greenko. “Taking into account the fact that pumped storage project can deliver more than one cycle per day without any impact on the performance, effective storage charges can be significantly lower at $29/MWh.”

Energetica Industries, an Austrian solar panel maker, had to file for insolvency due to financial difficulties in November 2021. In the months that followed, a financially strong investor, IRMA Power, acquired it and affirmed its willingness to continue module production in Liebenfels, where the manufacturer is headquartered.
In the first few months after the takeover of Energetica, the focus for Martin Kurschel, the owner of IRMA Power, was on ramping up module production. He said the production of solar modules is now running at full speed again, with annual production capacity reaching 350 MW.
“We will soon be switching from three to four-shift operation,” Kurschel told pv magazine. “Energetica is again employing around 100 people, including many specialists who worked for the company before the insolvency. Further scaling of production is already being planned for next year.”
The cells for the solar modules come from China, but the end products are entirely manufactured in Austria. Some of Energetica's solar modules are intended for use in its own real estate projects, developed by IRMA Power itself.
“It is incredibly important for us to understand how, what and with what quality the panels are produced,” Kurschel said, in reference to cases of underperforming PV systems built with Energetica's products in the past. “We're still working on fixing the warranty. Two to three cases still have to be settled.”
There have been no such issues since the restart of production, said Kurschel.
“It's about restoring trust completely,” he said, adding that IRMA Power has deliberately decided against changing to a new brand name.
The factory in Liebenfels currently produces two types of modules – “e.Classic” and “e.Prime.” They are monocrystalline modules with 120 half cells and M6 wafers, with 12 busbars and shingle tech. The most powerful product offers 390 W of output, and both module types are also available in black.
From next year, Energetica also wants to bring facade modules onto the market.
“They should be derived from our previous standard modules,” said Kurschel. “We also want to take the step from M6 to M10 wafers.”
Energetica said it will invest in two more production lines.

“They are one-hundredth the weight of conventional solar panels, generate 18 times more power-per-kilogram, and are made from semiconducting inks using printing processes that can be scaled in the future to large-area manufacturing,” the researchers said, noting that the thin-film devices can be laminated onto many different surfaces. “Ultra-thin PVs can be prepared on premade substrates such as plastic films and metal foils, or on in-situ formed substrates such as chemical vapor-deposited parylene or solution-processed polyimide.”
The US group built the module's cells with vapor-deposited parylene as the in-situ formed releasable substrate, a hole-transporting material (HTM) based on PEDOT:PSS, a donor-acceptor pair molecule known as PV2000:PC60BM that was provided by Taiwan's Raynergy Tek, and coated nanowire films of 7.7 nm, with the deposition of tin-oxide nanoparticles, act as the electron transport layer.
“The photoactive layer of PV2000:PCBM is coated, followed by the hole-transporting PEDOT:PSS layer,” the scientists explained. ” A relatively thick layer of the hole transporting material is coated on top of the active layer to provide sufficient protection from the mechanically abrasive process of screen-printing the silver top electrode.”
They built integrated fabric-PV modules with specific power of 370 W kg−1, weighing 105 g m−2, and free-standing devices with a specific power of 730 W kg−1, wighing 52 g m−2.
“Overall, the ultra-thin device performance was comparable to devices made directly on glass except for a reduction in short circuit current which was ascribed to the reduced transmission from process variation between in-house deposition of the transparent electrode in comparison to commercially procured ones deposited directly on glass,” they said, noting that the current aslo decreased upon delamination due to some wrinkling of the free-standing film. “Such small-scale device tests provided sufficient support to proceed further with the process development of fabricating larger OPV modules.”
They presented the new organic cell tech in “Printed Organic Photovoltaic Modules on Transferable Ultra-thin Substrates as Additive Power Sources,” which was recently published in Small Methods.
“Essential to fully realizing the potential of this work, is the availability of equally ultra-lightweight encapsulation barriers that can protect the active layers of fabric-PVs from atmospheric exposure, which in turn can extend the operational lifetime of these devices, as needed for real-world applications,” they concluded.

They reportedly suppressed carrier recombination at the interface between the perovskite and the charge transport layer, as well as defect-assisted recombination originating from the perovskite layer.
The cell has a p-i-n structure, which means the perovskite cell material is deposited onto the hole transport layer, and then coated with the electron transport layer, unlike with conventional n-i-p device architecture. Inverted perovskite solar cells typically show strong stability, but lag behind conventional devices in terms of conversion efficiency and cell performance.
“For the first time, we used a molecule known as daminozide (DA) as interlayer and additive, to modify the perovskite buried interface energetics, and passivate defects at the such buried interface as well as in the perovskite bulk,” researcher Qinye Bao told pv magazine.
They built the cell with an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a hole transport layer (HTL) made of poly-triarylamine (PTAA) and doped with the p-type dopant F4TCNQ and DA itself, a methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite layer, a DA interlayer, an electron acceptor made of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
“The dependences of the device power conversion efficiency on the DA interlayer thickness and the DA concentration are carefully evaluated, and the resulting optimal thickness and concentration are 4 nm and 0.05 wt.%, respectively,” the researchers explained.
The device has a power conversion efficiency of 22.15%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.131 V, a short-circuit current of 23.36 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 83.92%. For comparison, a reference device without the DA interlayer achieved an efficiency rating of 19.04%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.074 V, a short-circuit current of 22.33 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 83.16%.
“These are the highest efficiency and the highest fill factor for polycrystalline MAPbI 3-based p-i-n perovskite solar cells reported to date,” the scientists said. 
They found that an unencapsulated device was able to maintain more than 90% of its initial efficiency after 1,400 hours of storage in ambient conditions, while the control device quickly loses approximately 80% of its initial value after only 700 hours of storage.
They reported their results in “Synchronous Modulation of Defects and Buried Interfaces for Highly Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.
“This work highlights the importance of synchronous management of defects and buried interfaces, and thus provides a promising potential for further improving the efficiency and stability of planar perovskite solar cells,” they concluded.

CSIRO has published a new report that details the enormous potential Australia has to become a global superpower in PV energy generation and exports, but warns that it must develop its own fully integrated domestic silicon and solar supply chains to realize this potential.
The Australian Silicon Action Plan (ASAP), commissioned by CSIRO and authored by PricewaterhouseCoopers Australia (PwC), urges the nation to “quickly” develop a full-fledged domestic supply chain for silicon and solar cells, in order to improve the nation’s energy independence and sovereign capability.
CSIRO Senior Principal Research Scientist Chris Vernon said the report shows that Australia has great potential when it comes to the leading role it can play in the global energy transition. However, its current reliance on concentrated silicon and solar cell supply chains risks holding it back.
“Australia already has the highest per capita deployment of rooftop solar in the world, and there are several mega-projects in the solar development pipeline,” he said. “But one of the greatest risks to Australia’s solar ambitions and energy future is our reliance on overseas supply chains for solar cell technology.”
Modeling by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) shows that the deployment of solar power technology, at increasing scale, will be critical to the success of the global energy transition.
Solar’s contribution to the energy mix in Australia is expected to increase from 12% to approximately 50% by 2050, while IRENA estimates annual global solar power generation capacity must increase more than fivefold by 2030, and 14-fold by 2050 to stay on track for net-zero targets.
To keep pace with these solar capacity forecasts, annual global production of silicon and its purified form polysilicon – critical for its importance to new economy technologies such as solar cells, semiconductors (chips), optical fibers, aluminum alloys, and its potential use in energy storage batteries – will have to materially increase.
Australia currently imports about 80% of its solar panels from China, which also controls the vast amount of materials processing for other renewable technologies. China currently controls about 90% of the global production of refined rare earths, and the majority of critical minerals. About 70% of silicon is produced in China, and it also dominates the production of polysilicon. The conversion of polysilicon to solar cells is even more concentrated, with China accounting for between 75% and 97% of these stages of production.
CSIRO said increasing production of silicon in Australia is the first step for the nation to develop its own capability and capacity in the solar cell supply chain. According to the report, the nation can develop a fully integrated silicon and solar cell supply chain, from quartz mining through to manufacturing, end-of-life processes, and recycling to support and derisk the overall solar supply chain.
“This supply chain starts with our endowment of high-quality quartz, which can be processed to metallurgical grade silicon, then to solar grade polysilicon,” Vernon said, adding “energy independence should be a top priority for Australia.”
To achieve the desired goals, the ASAP outlines “achievable” recommendations and actions for government and industry to pursue, including incentivising the supply of raw materials and building Australia’s capacity in silicon production; developing ingot, wafer and solar cell manufacturing capabilities; and expanding the nation’s supply chain activity.
Vernon said the vision will not be achieved without “a high level of collaboration between all stakeholders, from miners and refiners to state and federal governments, to R&D providers, to the manufacturing industry.”
Federal Industry Minister Ed Husic said the ASAP is a welcome contribution to discussions about how best to establish new manufacturing capabilities in Australia and noted the potential alignment with the recently announced National Reconstruction Fund, including value-adding in resources and for renewables and low-emissions technologies.
“The report highlights the part silicon plays in new technologies such as solar cells, semiconductor chips, optical fibers, aluminum alloys and its potential for use in batteries,” he said. “As I’ve said previously, if we mine it here, we should make it here.”

Grid-scale energy storage capacity is expected to surpass 30 GW/111 GWh of installed capacity by the end of 2025, according to a new report by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).
Battery storage capacity in the United States was negligible prior to 2020, at which point storage capacity began to ramp up. As of October 2022, 7.8 GW of utility-scale storage assets began operating, with 1.4 GW of additional capacity to be added by the end of 2022. The EIA expects another 20.8 GW of battery storage capacity to be added from 2023 to 2025.
Growth in energy storage capacity is outpacing the pace of early growth of utility-scale solar. US solar capacity began expanding in 2010 and grew from less than 1.0 GW in 2010 to 13.7 GW in 2015. In comparison, the EIA sees energy storage increasing from 1.5 GW in 2020 to 30 GW in 2025.
Energy storage adds stability to intermittent clean energy sources such as wind and solar. Batteries solve the intermittency problem by storing extra energy produced by wind or solar generators for use later in the day.
While it may come as no surprise, more than 75% of the 20.8 GW of new utility-scale battery capacity that developers plan to install from 2022 to 2025 is located in Texas (7.9 GW) and California (7.6 GW).
More utility-scale solar capacity is located in California than any other state, at 16.8 GW, and developers expect to add another 7.7 GW of solar generating capacity between 2023 and 2025, furthering the ramp up necessary for grid-scale storage solutions.
Another 10.5 GW of utility-scale solar capacity is located in Texas. Developers plan to install another 20.4 GW of solar capacity between 2023 and 2025.  Not to mention, Texas is home to 37.2 GW of wind power capacity, more than any other state, and developers expect to add 5.3 GW of new wind turbines over the next three years.
As more battery capacity becomes available, storage projects are becoming increasingly larger in capacity. Before 2020, the largest battery storage project was 40 MW. The 250 MW Gateway Energy Storage System in California, which began operating in 2020, marked the beginning of large-scale energy storage installations.
At present, the 409 MW Manatee Energy Storage in Florida is the largest operating battery storage project in the United States. Developers have scheduled more than 23 grid-scale battery projects, ranging from 250 MW to 650 MW, to be deployed by 2025.
Funding for the massive energy storage roll out will come in part from the Inflation Reduction Act, which BloombergNEF states will drive the development of 30 GW (111 GWh) of energy storage capacity by 2030. The IRA stipulates $369 billion in clean energy investments, as well as 30% tax credit for energy storage systems.

Squad Mobility will show off its new Squad solar electric vehicle – a golf-cart-like, battery-powered vehicle that can charge itself with sunlight – in January at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
The company says the car has a 62-mile range on a full battery charge, and can source an average of about 12 miles per day from the sun with its built-in solar array. It is pricing its base model at $6,250.
The two-passenger vehicle has a solar roof and can also be charged via a 220 V port. It has two 2 kW motors and swappable lithium-ion batteries. Each swappable battery in the Squad has a capacity of 1.6 kWh, adding up to 6.4 kWh in total. The company says it will develop “Squad Battery Walls” with precharged swappable batteries for fleet managers.
The Squad is designed for short trips, with a compact design to navigate congested city streets. It has removable doors for warmer climates.
The vehicle tops out at about 44 miles (70.8 km) per hour and is 2 meters in length, 1.2 meters wide, and 1.6 meters high. It has a 6-meter turning circle, creating a compact design for easy parking. It has a full aluminum tubular roll cage and crash structures in the front and rear and holds up to 243 liters of storage.
“Combining low capex and opex with the capability of remote diagnosis, Squad provides essential vehicle data 24/7 for efficient fleet management. Both the interior and exterior are easy to clean, while broken parts are easy to replace,” said Squad Mobility. “The wheels act as natural bumpers, preventing damage to body parts. An extra option is the Squad battery wall for quickly changing and charging the batteries.”
