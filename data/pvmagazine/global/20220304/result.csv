Steering away from the mass market, the Swedish premium automotive brand presented this week its second concept car, a sports roadster named Polestar O2. The hard-top convertible incorporates a drone that can be launched from its dock behind the rear seats whilst driving to capture footage of the journey. The drone operates autonomously, automatically following the car at speeds up to 90km/h. In addition, Polestar's new design takes the next steps toward greater circularity with recycled polyester thermoplastic mono-material and aluminum labeling, allowing them to be recycled more effectively and for their properties to be retained.
Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic has revealed plans for two new production facilities for its lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). The company officially announced on Monday that it will establish a manufacturing facility at its Wakayama Factory in western Japan to make new, high-capacity 4680 lithium-ion battery cells for EVs. Panasonic said it is currently in the process of developing the new battery cells across multiple locations within Japan and that mass production is set to start by the fiscal year ending in March 2024. Last month, Panasonic announced it will be giving US electric car manufacturer Tesla top priority for the new 4680 battery cells. Without revealing any performance data, Panasonic presented a prototype for its 4680 battery cell in October last year. Shortly before, Tesla unveiled its own 4680 battery cell produced at its Kato facility in California. Six times the power of the NCA battery cell currently used by the US carmaker, Panasonic's 4680 cylindrical cell – 46 millimeters wide and 80 millimeters tall – is designed not only to improve the range and performance of electric cars but also to be cheaper per kWh and significantly reduce the investment costs in their production. Tesla is currently building its 4680 cells at a facility in Fremont, in California, and deploying large-scale production at other factories, including Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin. Its first model with 4680 cells – the Model Y – built at Giga Texas is about to be released for sale. But this is not where the Panasonic-Tesla news end. On Friday, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported that Panasonic is looking to purchase land in the US to make a mega-factory in Oklahoma or Kansas close to Texas where Tesla is preparing a new EV plant. The news hasn't been confirmed by the Japanese corporation.
Sony Group and Honda Motor will team up to develop electric vehicles, as the Japanese tech firm continues to further its next-generation mobility ambitions. The two companies have signed a memorandum of understanding to set up a joint venture this year and market their first EV model in 2025. Honda will make the cars, while Sony will develop the mobility service platform. The electronics manufacturer first signaled its intention to drive into the electromobility market at CES 2020 when it displayed its Vision-S concept EV, showcasing its entertainment and software expertise. At CES 2022 held in January, Sony showed its SUV-type vehicle Vision-S 02 and announced plans to create a new company called Sony Mobility, saying it was exploring a commercial launch of EVs.
This week, Amsterdam-headquartered conglomerate Stellantis has unveiled its Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, committing to reaching carbon net-zero emissions by 2038, with an interim goal of 50% reduction by 2030. As part of that agenda, the company, a 50-50 merger between the Italian-American conglomerate Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and the French PSA Group, has set a course for 100% of sales in Europe and 50% of sales in the United States to be battery electric vehicles by the end of this decade. Its plan is to have more than 75 BEVs and reach global annual BEV sales of five million vehicles by 2030. Towards this goal, Stellantis has taken the wraps off its first fully electric jeep, scheduled to launch in 2023, and presented a preview of its new Ram 1500 BEV pickup truck arriving in 2024. The company's ambitious plan also outlines its intention to double its net revenues to €300 billion by 2030.
In a bid to strengthen their sustainability credentials, both Kia and Hyundai have announced plans to source renewable energy to power their EV charging networks in Europe. The South Korean automakers have made separate investments and agreements with e-mobility service provider Digital Charging Solutions (DCS) to ensure that its customers charging needs are met by energy generated by wind farms from across Europe. With the help of the green charging option provided by DCS and through the purchase of Guarantee of Origin (GO) certificates, both companies will ensure that their European charging networks – my Hyundai and Kia Charge – run on renewable energy, with the equivalent amount of energy for every charging usage fed back into the grid as green electricity.
Another major carmaker, US-based Ford, is looking to speed up its transition to EVs with one of the most sweeping reorganizations to date. The automaker announced on Wednesday that it is splitting its operations into two distinct businesses – electric vehicle and gas-powered divisions. Ford’s chief executive, Jim Farley, said in an interview with Bloomberg that the two businesses required different skills and mindsets that would clash and hinder each area if they remained parts of one organization. “You can’t be successful and beat Tesla that way,” he said. Ford expects to produce more than two million EVs annually by 2026, representing about one-third of its global volume, rising to half by 2030. According to Farley, Ford will spend $50 billion on EVs between 2022 and 2026, up from previously planned $30 in the five years ending in 2025. It plans to spend $5 billion on EVs in 2022, a two-fold increase over 2021.
Meanwhile, newcomers to the automotive sector are doing their bit to speed up the electrification of transport. California-based EV start-up Mullen Technologies has reported impressive results from its solid-state battery testing, including a range of 600-plus miles (965 km) on a full charge and over 300 miles (483km) of range delivered in 18 minutes with DC fast charging. The company tested its 300 Ah cell which yielded 343 Ah at 4.3 volts and “the results exceeded all expectations”. Mullen is working towards utilizing solid-state polymer battery packs in its second generation Mullen FIVE EV Crossovers, with in-vehicle prototype testing set for 2025. Mullen’s first-generation FIVE EV Crossover, due in late 2024, is planned to launch with traditional lithium-ion cell chemistry. In parallel, the company is also conducting research on lithium-sulfur and lithium-iron-phosphate batteries.
Starting from Monday, Tesla has temporarily enabled free supercharging for both Tesla and non-Tesla cars at sites impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Superchargers will first open in Trzebownisko, Poland and Košice, Slovakia, east of the Ukraine border, as well as Miskolc and Debrecen south-east of Ukraine in Hungary. “We hope that this helps give you the peace of mind to get to a safe location,” the company said in a note to customers. This initiative marks Tesla's first time activating free supercharging for non-Tesla vehicles.

Mitrex, a Canadian solar technology manufacturer, is launching the Solar Brick. This solar-integrated surface looks just like a brick wall, but embedded lie solar modules.
Mitrex Solar Brick facades can be made up of 330W solar panels, which are constructed in the same manner as Mitrex’ other BIPV panels. As shown here, the panels are backed by an aluminum honeycomb sandwiched between layers of solid aluminum sheets, making it both
lightweight and durable.

 
The monocrystaline solar cell is topped with a glass façade in various designs, and the the surface is coated with patented anti-reflective and anti-soiling coatings. The standard panel sizes range from 2-3.5 ft. by 4-6.66 ft. and they can customize panel sizes up to a maximum of 6.5 ft. by 12 ft. The glass is customizable and other looks include granite, porcelain, brick, wood, or customized graphics. There’s also a design that mimics roofing tiles. Mitrex said its Solar Brick is suitable for new construction projects or retrofits of older structures, including recladding or over-cladding.
“Our mission is to transform how we build our structures—electrically-powered buildings are a logical and sustainable solution to combat climate change,” says Mitrex CEO Danial Hadizadeh.
Mitrex solar facades are being put the test in an installation on a building in Etobicoke, Toronto.

The wall will cover an area of over 7,000 square feet of customized solar façade panels and has the capacity to generate 100 kW of energy. The installation is using three different colored facades with a combination of stone cladding. When complete, the wall system is expected to produce 90,000 kWh power annually.

Brussels-based Tree Energy Solutions (TES) is accelerating its announced plans to develop the German port of Wilhelmshaven into a “world-scale” hub for importing green gas. “TES Green hydrogen will be primarily produced using solar, wind, and hydropower in countries with abundant renewable energy sources, after which CO2 will be added to make green CH4 which will be used as the energy carrier,” the company said Wednesday. The methane will then be transported to Wilhelmshaven through a specially built fleet of ships. “At Wilhelmshaven, the green CH4 can be converted back into green hydrogen, with the resulting CO2 being captured and returned to the producing countries by ship in a continuous closed-loop system.”
Penn State scientists unveiled a “highly sensitive system” for detecting hydrogen evolution, which could reportedly help the development of water splitting processes and in general of the hydrogen sector. The “new system … is the most sensitive in the world,” said Venkatraman Gopalan, professor of materials science and engineering and physics at Penn State. According to the researchers, the tool can efficiently screen promising photocatalysts. “If you ranked low in both the categories of hydrogen evolution rate and the mass of the photocatalyst needed, it means it’s a really sensitive system for discovering new photocatalytic materials. And it turns out that our work ranked the best in both categories,” said Huaiyu Wang, who led the study published on Review of Scientific Instruments. 
German manufacturing and engineering company MAN Energy Solutions will invest up to €500 million in its hydrogen-focused subsidiary H-TEC Systems in the coming years. “We are transforming H-TEC Systems into one of the world's leading players in the field of PEM electrolysis. Over the next five to ten years, green hydrogen will become one of the most important primary energy sources for the global economy as it continues to decarbonize,” said Uwe Lauber, CEO of MAN Energy Solutions. H-TEC Systems would benefit from the strong ties with MAN Energy Solutions, “but also from direct access to the expertise and experience of the Volkswagen Group, especially in matters relating to production scaling and the supplier-based series production business.”
Malmö-based chemistry group Perstorp, Finnish state-owned energy company Fortum, and Düsseldorf-based Uniper submitted a €97 million application to the EU Innovation Fund for Project Air, which aims to build a production facility for sustainable methanol in Stenungssund, Sweden. “The project is possible thanks to an innovative usage of biogas, hydrogen from electrolysis and residue streams, as well as carbon dioxide recovered from Perstorp’s own facilities, to produce the methanol. This means the project will utilize carbon atoms that would otherwise become CO2 emissions,” the companies wrote on Thursday. The total investment in Project Air is expected to total €236.3 million.
Indian industry body India Hydrogen Alliance (IH2A) has proposed the creation of the H2Bharat Public-Private Taskforce for a gigawatt-scale national hydrogen hub development plan. The proposal was addressed to NITI Aayog and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), “with the aim of identifying at least five large GW-scale Green hydrogen hubs for development in India, within next 18-months.” NITI Aayog and IH2A proposed to support the development through a seven-point plan, including co-location of Green H2 production and consumption, public funding, a collaboration between the private and the public sector, sovereign green bonds, synergies between different national hydrogen hubs, and support for cluster developments. “Our aim is to bring down the cost of green hydrogen to $2.5/kg by 2025 and $1/kg by 2030. This is possible only by increasing size and scale of hydrogen manufacturing,” commented Amitabh Kant, chief executive of NITI Aayog, commented. 
Hydrogen developer Green Hydrogen International (GHI) presented its Hydrogen City project, an integrated green hydrogen production, storage, and transport hub in Texas that would reach up to 60 GW. “Pipelines will deliver the green hydrogen to Corpus Christi and Brownsville where it will be turned into green ammonia, sustainable aviation fuel and other products, or delivered by pipeline directly to hydrogen power plants and other users around the state,” the company wrote on its website. The project will be built gradually, like other hydrogen projects. The first phase, which should commence operations in 2026, consists of 2 GW of production and two storage caverns at the Piedras Pintas salt dome. Onshore wind and solar will power the electrolyzers. “Eventually, over 50 caverns can be created at the Piedras Pintas salt dome, providing up to 6 TWh of energy storage.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/04/thermochemical-storage-plus-rooftop-pv-to-store-heat-for-winter-months/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 4, 2022",Thermochemical storage-plus-rooftop PV to store heat for winter months,"Researchers from Swansea University in the United Kingdom are investigating how thermochemical storage (TCS) may be used in combination with rooftop PV for seasonal heat storage.
“Our vision for the project is to bring to market a modular, multi-vector energy system that can be installed into new homes and retrofitted into existing buildings,” project lead Robert Barthorpe told pv magazine. “Our focus is to rapidly advance the capabilities of thermochemical (TCS) and phase change material (PCM) heat storage units, and smart control systems to enable them to be easily integrated with existing technologies such as rooftop PV, electrical storage and heat pumps.”
Barthorpe and his research team, which comprises scientists from Loughborough University, University of Sheffield and UK heat pump specialist Mixergy Ltd, recently secured funding of £146,000 from the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to further develop its system, which is being designed to provide storage for up to months at a time without standing losses, providing cost and carbon benefits to both building occupants and energy networks.
In a fully integrated system, the rooftop solar array would be used to power a heat pump or another electrical heating element, which in turn produces the heat to be stored by the thermal devices. The PCM module is suited to providing flexibility over a period of hours or days, while the TCS is capable of storing energy for long-term use during the cold months of the year. “Once charged, the TCS system can be cooled to ambient temperature and the energy stored until needed,” the research group said in a statement. “When required, moisture is reintroduced, which then releases the heat for use within the home.”
“This has the potential to provide day-to-day storage of thermal energy at densities far greater than traditional technologies,” the academics explained. The PCM system employs a thermal source to heat a chemical store to transition the solid material into liquid form. “The effect of this is to store latent heat for several days. The heat stored can be released to provide hot water or space heating simply by pumping lower temperature water through the system.” PCMs are able to absorb, store and release large amounts of latent heat over a defined temperature range and have often been used, at the research level, for PV module cooling.
The heat storage modules conceived by the UK group are ideally suited to use with PV systems, with benefits expected across a broad range of system sizes and inverter types. Excess PV generation may be used to charge either short or long-term stores either directly through resistive heating elements, or via a heat pump to benefit from further advantages in terms of coefficient of performance.
The team estimates that, with a similar system configuration, home occupants could benefit from savings of around £300 pa in the case where a single unit — TCS or PCM — is installed and the occupant makes use of  Time of Use Tariff (TOUT), which encourages customers to use energy at off-peak times, to charge the store. Where the occupant has access to a PV array or an electrical storage battery, the savings are expected to be greater still.
The team is currently mid-way through a feasibility study that is investigating potential unit costs for consumers along with technical optimization opportunities.
In the proposed system configuration, the rooftop solar array is used to power a heat pump or another electrical heating element, which in turn produces the heat to be stored for the cold months of the year. “Once charged, the system can be cooled to ambient temperature and the energy stored,” the research group said in a statement. “When required, moisture is reintroduced, which then releases the heat for use within the home.”
The scientists are also planning to combine this technology with another one based on the use of an unspecified type of PCM.
Both systems would be managed through smart control systems to optimize their performance and optimize storage levels.

The regulator expects to contract around 864 GWh of renewable energy in the procurement exercise, of which 144 GWh should be contracted from renewable energy plants ranging in size from 5 to 20 MW and around 720 GWh from facilities with a capacity between 20 and 50 MW. For comparison, in the third auction held in December 2021, HEPURA contracted a total of 299 GWh.
Under the fourth procurement exercise, HEPURA will award feed-in premium payments – on top of wholesale electricity returns – during 15-year contracts.
Bids will have to be submitted between March 25 and March 28. The auction is part of the METAR-KÁT renewables incentive program introduced by the Hungarian government in 2017.
“The first three rounds of METAR auctions allowed connecting an additional 524 MW solar capacity to the Hungarian grid, where the fourth round supported 135 MW of existing hydropower and biomass capacities,” Hungarian renewable energy specialist Ferenc Kis told pv magazine. “The latter competition allowed only 20 days to prepare the bids, and the winners of the four projects got a weighted price of €100/MWh. The present call announced today limits the bidding price to €71/MWh and €65/MWh in the two categories. This time, there is a requirement to provide battery storage capacity at 10% of the planned power production unit.”
Solar was so far successful only in the first three procurement exercises held by the Hungarian authorities.
In the third exercise, HEPURA contracted 299 GW and allocated 183 MW of PV capacity. For the small PVPP category that included installations between 300 kW and 1 MW, the final average price was HUF 21.26 ($0.061)/ kWh, while in the large PVPP group, with projects ranging in size from 1 MW to 20 MW, the final average price was HUF 16.15 ($0.046)/ kWh.
In the second auction, which was finalized in February, the lowest bid came in at HUF 16.18/kWh. For installations between 300 kW and 1 MW, final prices varied from HUF 21/kWh to HUF 23.03/kWh, while in the group including projects ranging in size from 1 MW to 49.9 MW, final prices ranged from HUF 16.18/kWh to HUF 17.97/kWh. The average final prices in the first and second categories reached HUF 22.35 and HUF 17.22, respectively.
In the first pilot auction held in March 2020, the HEPURA awarded almost all the 131.9 MW capacity to solar projects. The final average price was HUF 24.81/kWh in the first category and HUF 21.69/kWh in the second. The lowest bid of HUF 20.20/kWh was submitted for a 20 MW solar plant.

Swiss solar module manufacturer Megasol has launched the bifacial module M500-HC-144-b RC GG U30b with a reported power conversion efficiency of 23.2%.
The company claimed to have improved the efficiency of the panel, which previously featured an efficiency of 22.1%, through a new back-contact technology dubbed “RearCon.”
“By moving the busbars to the rear, we eliminated the problem of self-shading, as every contact on a cell covers cell area with which electricity can be generated,” explained Michael Reist, head of communications and marketing at Megasol. In addition, the manufacturer said it used busbars with particularly high conductivity for the rear contact. “This reduces the internal resistance and, as a result, the ohmic losses considerably,” Reist continued, noting that this also reduces the cell spacing. “In fact, the cell spacing is negative — the cells overlap very slightly by 0.3 millimeters. This gapless stringing leads to space savings and higher efficiency,” he affirmed.
The rated output of the new 144-cell glass-glass module is 500 W. Depending on the albedo of the ground, a bifacial additional yield of up to 30% is possible, according to the product sheet from the Swiss photovoltaic manufacturer.

The dimensions of the module are 2,063 x 1,046 x 30 mm and its weight is 26.5 kg. It features a black anodized aluminum frame and is suitable for use in a temperature range of -40 to +85 degrees Celsius and a maximum system voltage of 1,500 volts. The manufacturer offers a 15-year product and 30-year linear performance guarantee for its new module.
“The RearCon technology requires only about half as many production steps as the production of previously known solar modules with rear contact,” Reist further explained. Which production steps would be saved is a trade secret. However, the cheaper production will affect the overall costs for customers. “We would like to pass this cost advantage on to our partners. That's why the prices of the RearCon solar modules are significantly lower than what has previously been seen for solar modules with rear contact. That can be 30% or even more,” he added.
Megasol sees significant improvements not only in terms of performance and production costs, but also in terms of appearance, since it is a completely black module. “The contacts on the back of the busbars result in a more homogeneous appearance and thus significantly improved aesthetics of the solar modules,” the manufacturer said. “This is particularly important for use in solar facades.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/04/p-type-vs-n-type-poly-si-siox-passivating-contacts/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 4, 2022",P-type vs n-type poly-Si/SiOx passivating contacts,"Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) and the University of Melbourne have compared the firing stability of p-type and n-type passivating contacts based on polysilicon and silicon monoxide (SiOx), which are used in screen-printed solar cells to reduce carrier recombination at the metal/silicon interface.
The scientists explained that the high-temperature firing treatment currently in use as a post-deposition annealing step in the commercial production of screen-printed solar cells must be perfectly gauged to achieve high quality of the poly-Si structures in passivated and contacted regions. “The firing stability of n-type poly-Si passivating contacts has been studied by a number of research groups,” they emphasized. “Few studies have been performed on the firing influence of p-type poly-Si contacts. This paper evaluates the firing stability of p-type poly-Si passivating contacts, and then compares the response of p- and n-type poly-Si to rapid firing and subsequent thermal treatments.”
The research group used secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to investigate the root causes for the different firing behavior in samples passivated by p- and n-type poly-Si with similar passivation quality and crystal properties. The firing treatment was performed through rapid thermal annealing (RTA) furnace and the samples were sandwiched between two 180-μm thick dummy wafers.
The temperature for boron diffusion was maintained between 900 and 980 degrees Celsius and the firing operations were performed at 800 degrees Celsius. “The samples subjected to a boron diffusion at 980°C had the best performance before firing, followed by the samples diffused at 950°C and 900°C,” it explained, noting that increasing the diffusion temperature improves the firing stability of the p-type poly-Si/SiOx contacts. “Adjusting the diffusion temperature appears to show a lesser impact on p-type poly-Si than on n-type poly-Si. In contrast to the severe firing impact on lightly doped n-type poly-Si, only small surface degradation was detected on lowly doped p-type poly-Si after 800°C firing.”
The academics believe that the passivation quality of the contacts after the firing operations may depend on the amount of hydrogen released during the process from the dielectric films to the SiOx interlayer, as well as excess hydrogen around the SiOx. “This speculation was also supported by the increased degradation extent after injecting more hydrogen, as well as the recovered current density after reducing the hydrogen content around the SiOx thin layer via a 300°C N2 anneal after the removal of fired silicon nitride (SiNx),” they stated. “In contrast to n-type poly-Si, the current density of p-type poly-Si was recovered after injecting more hydrogen to the poly-Si/SiOx stack by the re-hydrogenation treatment, which could possibly indicate that there was no excess hydrogen in p-type poly-Si/SiOx, possibly attributed to the lower effective diffusivity of atomic hydrogen in p-type materials.”
The scientists concluded that the diffusivity of hydrogen in p-type poly-Si is lower than in n-type, which prevents the accumulation of excess hydrogen around the oxide which deteriorates the passivation quality. “The results extend our understanding of the firing effect on poly-Si/SiOx structures, which may help to further improve the performance of doped poly-Si contacts,” they added.
Their findings are available in the paper Comparison of firing stability between p- and n-type polysilicon passivating contacts, published in Progress in Photovoltaics.

French start-up Carbon has announced plans to build a 5 GW solar panel factory in France.
Expected to be commissioned in 2025, the new factory is to reach an annual capacity of 15 GW by 2030. The project will require a total investment of €1 billion. For this purpose, Carbon and its partners are currently looking for investors to finance the project. “We are going to carry out the first funding round at the end of the year, representing 10% of the amount of the investment,” Pascal Richard, former founder of SMA France and Carbon co-founder told pv magazine. “Then, we will hold more rounds that will be open to three levels of investors: industrial strategic partners, private investment funds and regional, national and European public entities.”
The company hopes to bring into operation a pilot site with 1.5 GW of annual capacity in 2024. The panels will be based on TOPCon and IBC technologies. “The production lines will be designed to be scalable and to integrate the different technologies without reinvestment,” Richard explained.
Ultimately, the manufacturing facility will also supply the building and automotive markets with high-efficiency building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) cells.
In terms of costs, Richard assured that “everything is calculated so that the products, although of high-quality, are competitive with the prices charged by Asian competition,” in particular thanks to economies of scale. “Without competitive prices, it is impossible to attract investments,” he added. The company intends to announce soon the official support of its first French and European investors.
According to some forecasts, Europe's currently installed solar PV capacity of 199 GW is expected to double by 2025, then quadruple by 2030. “The demand for photovoltaic panels will therefore continue to increase massively, reaching around 60 GW per year in 2025 then 100 GW per year in 2030 on a European scale. However, in the face of Asian competition, which is driving prices down, the European photovoltaic industrial sector remains fragile and undersized. It is therefore urgent to act to change scale,” Carbon said in a press release.
A project with a European dimension, Carbon is supported by the international research center on solar energy ISC Konstanz in Germany, recognized European developer of TOPCon and IBC technologies, as well as the Becquerel Institute in Belgium, with which it collaborates on technological, competitiveness and market access aspects.

Spanish solar manufacturer Aurinka is planning to build a solar module manufacturing facility at an undisclosed location in Spain's eastern Aragon region. “The turbulent geopolitical situation has seemed to us to be a good scenario for the return of manufacturing to Spain,” the company's CEO, Benjamín Llaneza, told pv magazine, noting that strong demand for solar products and high freight costs were also two decisive factors for the decision to construct the factory. “Its construction will depend on a 1.2 GW solar project currently under development in Andorra.”
The factory is expected to begin operating with an annual capacity of 300 MW and to produce bifacial modules with a power output of 600 W.
“Another leg of the Aurinka industrial project, which is not tied to the project in Andorra, consists of the building of a facility for repairing second-life panels or recycling non-repairable modules,” Llaneza added. The location is yet to be defined and logistics will play a key role.”
Aurinka has been investing in research and development for more than two years. “We are looking for an economically and technically viable solution that respects the environment, following the criteria of the circular economy. We do not want to opt for a destructive solution for the photovoltaic module with a low rate of recovery of the materials and we are developing our own technology, which will allow the recovery of almost 100% of the materials of the module.”
Aurinka also aims to produce UMG silicon manufacturing in Puertollano, Castile-La Mancha, in central Spain. The company says its patented low-carbon production process offers low enough manufacturing costs to compete with Asian rivals.

A completely climate-neutral heating supply in the building sector, including existing buildings, is possible in Germany in 2035. Households could do it even more cheaply and save €11.5 billion ($12.7 billion) in energy costs per year from 2035, according to a new, Greenpeace-commissioned study by the Wuppertal Institute.
The study includes a six-point program that will purportedly help the country to achieve the heat transition by 2035. In order to phase out oil and gas in building heating in a timely manner, the researchers have proposed regulatory measures in three different areas with suitable financial support.
The researchers called for a phase-out law for fossil fuel heating systems, with simultaneous support for electric heat pumps and solar thermal energy. The installation of new gas and oil heating systems should also be banned by as early as 2024, they said. Existing systems should be gradually phased out. At the same time, a subsidy program for 12 million heat pumps and 70 million square meters of solar thermal systems should also be implemented to make the desired replacement more affordable.
There should also be a new obligation and subsidies for the renovation of buildings, which should be renovated in accordance with their energy efficiency standards. By 2040, all buildings should be expected to achieve efficiency class B (KfW-60). The refurbishment rate for buildings should rise to between 3% and 4%. In addition, district heating should be expanded through specific goals and funding measures.
“Although the short-term alternatives to natural gas for heating buildings are limited, in the medium-term there are many options for switching,” said Manfred Fischedick, scientific director of the Wuppertal Institute.“A clever strategy aimed at increasing efficiency and expanding renewable energies not only reduces the supply risks. The accelerated heat transition is also highly attractive from an economic point of view for households, companies and public institutions.”
Initially, the exit from oil and gas would require additional investments of €50 billion per year. The government would also need to earmark €22 billion in annual subsidies. If the calculation works out, consumers could save up to €11.5 billion per year in costs after the changeover.
In addition to the positive effects on the climate, an accelerated heat transition could also have positive economic effects. The authors of the study see a need for 500,000 specialists to implement the measures. A little more than half of them would focus on construction.
In early January, German Federal Climate Protection Minister Robert Habeck said that by 2030, half of all space heating requirements will be covered by renewable energy. In 2019, the total space heating requirement in Germany was 792TWh. Of this, 71% was accounted for by private households. As of today, 5% of them obtain their thermal energy from renewable sources.

The new provisions include an extreme simplification of permits to install commercial rooftop PV systems with a capacity of between 50kW and 200kW, which in Italy are allowed to operate under the country's net metering scheme, known as the “Scambio sul posto.”
From May, enterprises will only be allowed to begin the deployment of a rooftop solar array by using just one application form. The so-called “Modello Unico Semplificato” form is commonly used for ordinary building maintenance. This procedure was previously only granted to owners of PV systems with installed capacities of up to 50kW.
The Italian government has also decided to allocate €267 million ($294 million) to help small- and medium-sized enterprises to deploy PV systems for self-consumption. The funds will be used for rebates that will help businesses cover some of the costs to buy and install the solar arrays.
Fiscal sweeteners will also be granted to enterprises operating in the southern Italian regions of Abruzzo, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Molise, Puglia, Sardegna and Sicilia. The incentives will be provided to companies that decide to reduce their energy bills by investing in solar or energy efficiency.

Mining giant Fortescue has announced plans to spend almost AUD 70 million ($51.4 million) over the next two years to develop the world’s first Infinity Train, which will fully recharge its battery using gravitational energy generated on downhill sections of the miner’s rail network.
The train will be developed in collaboration with Williams Advanced Engineering (WAE), the UK-based offshoot of the Williams Formula 1 motorsport team. Fortescue acquired WAE for AUD 310 million in January. The acquisition was completed on Wednesday.
WAE will remain an independent company, but its battery technology division will be closely coordinated with Fortescue. It will be managed by Fortescue’s green energy, technology and development company Fortescue Future Industries. To mark the settlement of the acquisition, Fortescue and WAE have announced plans to develop what they said will be the world’s first zero- emission train.
The regenerating battery electric iron ore train project will use gravitational energy to fully recharge its battery electric systems without any additional charging requirements for the return trip to reload.
“The Infinity Train has the capacity to be the world’s most efficient battery electric locomotive,” said Fortescue CEO Elizabeth Gaines. “The regeneration of electricity on the downhill loaded sections will remove the need for the installation of renewable energy generation and recharging infrastructure, making it a capital efficient solution for eliminating diesel and emissions from our rail operations.”
Fortescue’s current rail operations include 54 operational locomotives. Its fleet consumed 82 million liters of diesel in the 2021 financial year, accounting for 11% of the company’s Scope 1 emissions. The company said this diesel consumption and associated emissions will be eliminated once the Infinity Train is fully implemented across its operations, significantly contributing to its target to be diesel- free by 2030.
Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest said that the Infinity Train will support the company’s ambition to reach net-zero emissions by the end of the decade. It will also lower the company’s operating costs, create maintenance efficiencies, and present new productivity opportunities, he added. In addition, Forrest expects that there will significant opportunities for the gravity energy technology to be commercialized on a global basis.
“The Infinity Train will join Fortescue’s green fleet under development and will contribute to Fortescue becoming a major player in the growing global market for green industrial transport equipment,” Forrest said. “The commercial opportunities are obvious for FFI as it pioneers this technology, captures its value and distributes it globally. Less obvious, is that we have an opportunity to not only lower our operating costs, eliminate the cost of diesel from our company but of course eliminate our rail system carbon emissions.”
Fortescue said its studies and development costs for the Infinity Train are expected to be almost AUD 70 million ($50 million) over the next two years.
WAE Chief Executive Craig Wilson said the project, which includes the design and construction of a bespoke battery electric powertrain, provides the company with an opportunity to help reduce emissions in the hard-to-abate heavy industry sector.
“High-performance battery and electrification systems are at the core of what we do and now that we are part of the Fortescue family, this presents an exciting opportunity to develop new technologies as we work together to tackle climate change,” he said.
The announcement of the Infinity Train project follows Fortescue’s recent purchase of two 14.5MWh electric trains from Progress Rail, which is owned by mining and construction equipment giant Caterpillar.

Peabody Energy, a coal company that serves customers in more than 25 countries, has launched R3 Renewables LLC, a renewables developer that will initially focus on building six potential projects on large tracts of land near unused coal mining sites in Indiana and Illinois.
In a joint venture with Riverstone Credit Partners and Summit Partners Credit Advisors, R3 Renewables plans to develop more than 3.3GW of solar PV and 1.6GW of battery storage capacity over the next five years. Peabody Energy said the sites are in close proximity to grid interconnection points, and claimed that the portfolio has the potential to facilitate the development of the largest solar and battery storage projects in Indiana and Illinois.
Developing solar on former mining sites is increasing clean energy use in many US states, including Kentucky, where the 200MW Martin County solar project is being constructed on 1,200 acres at the former Martiki coal mine site. In 2019, The Nature Conservancy developed a “Roadmap for Solar on Mine Lands,” which reports that there are up to 400,000 acres of former mining sites and other brownfield locations that could be suitable for large-scale solar across central Appalachia. If this land area is harnessed for solar development, it could double the total solar capacity installed in the United States to date, according to the 2019 report.
Jim Grech, the president and CEO of Peabody Energy, said that the company is not abandoning coal for renewables.
“We are pleased to announce this new joint venture as part of Peabody’s commitment to be the coal producer of choice, creating additional value from our existing assets, supporting our own and our customers’ ESG ambitions and providing added economic benefits for the communities in which we work and live,” said Grech.
John Jones, who has been appointed CEO of  R3 Renewables, has worked in the independent power industry for 30 years. He has held senior roles at GE EFS, Lincoln Clean Energy (now Ørsted North America Onshore), and Invenergy.
