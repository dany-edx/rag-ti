The scientists said they used halide salt methyldiammonium diiodide (MDADI) for surface defect passivation, which they said reduced the open-circuit voltage loss in the device's top cell based on perovskite while improving the overall tandem cell efficiency and near-infrared (NIR) transmittance.
The scientists grew the top cell through a multi-stage co-evaporation process. The device was based on a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), a hole transport layer (HTL) made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx), a perovskite absorber, a buckminsterfullerene (C60) electron transport layer (ETL), a tin oxide (SnOx) layer, an ITO layer, and an ultrathin lithium fluoride (LiF) interlayer.
“We then vary the optical pathways within the semi-transparent front cell to realize the control of the interference spectrum,” the team explained. “By matching the optical interference with the AM 1.5 G irradiance spectrum, the perovskite front cell achieves high average NIR transmittance (ANT) of 81.5% and an efficiency of 21.8%.”
The academics also explained that the MDADI-treated film can reach a much higher quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) compared with the one without the treatment. “The pseudo current-voltage (J-V) plot shows that the MDADI-treated film reaches an implied open-circuit voltage of 1.29 V, whereas the untreated film reaches only 1.24 V, and this marks a difference of around 50 mV.”
This top cell was then combined in a tandem device with a bottom cell made with a glass substrate coated with molybdenum (Mo), a CIS absorber, a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, and a window layer of zinc oxide (i-ZnO). This device has an efficiency of 17.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.60 V, a short-circuit current density of 39.7 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 72.9%.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the perovskite-CIS tandem cell achieved an efficiency of 29.9%, which the group said is the highest efficiency ever recorded for a perovskite-CIS tandem solar cell at the research level to date.
The scientists described the device in the study “29.9%-efficient, commercially viable perovskite/CuInSe2 thin-film tandem solar cells,” which was recently published in Joule. “These findings indicate the vast opportunities for all thin-film-based perovskite/CIS tandem cells in diverse applications and pave the way for their commercialization,” they said. “The combination of superior performance and cost-effectiveness makes them an attractive prospect for the solar industry.”
The research group included academics from the National University of Singapore, Switzerland’s Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA), and Germany's Forschungszentrum Jülich.

Prof. Ricardo Rüther installed Brazil's first PV system at the central campus of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) in 1997, after completing a postdoctorate in Solar Energy Systems at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) in Freiburg, Germany.
The 2 kW system was equipped with a 2 kW inverter from Germany's Würth Elektronik (later replaced by one from SMA) and 78 photovoltaic modules with 32 kW output each from Phototronics Solar Technik.
“Part of the institute's scholarship worked as a research grant, which provided that graduate students could take photovoltaic equipment to their home countries to continue their research,” Rüther told pv magazine.
He brought a 2 kW generator to Brazil, and in September of this year, it celebrated 26 years of uninterrupted operation.
“As the donation of the photovoltaic equipment was directed to the Federal University of Santa Catarina, the rector had to sign the term accepting the donation and the solar generator was installed in the university laboratory,” he said.
Without specific funds to deploy the system, Rüther and other students at the university handled the installation.
“There were no companies that could install it because no one had done it before. Since I had spent a few days at Phototronics before returning to Brazil, I was able to visit the facility and learn some of the installation procedures,” he said. “We fixed the modules ourselves to a metal structure we had made to measure, fixed the inverters to the walls and made all the electrical connections on the fly.”
Once the installation was completed, the group asked a local energy provider to connect the PV system to the electrical grid.
“At that time it was not allowed to connect a photovoltaic generator to the public electricity grid, but we also obtained the first access ruling in Brazil, through an authorization signed by the president of Centrais Elétricas de Santa Catarina (Celesc), which is the distributor here. in Florianópolis, because in 1997 it was not allowed,” Rüther said. “The president of the company authorized the university to connect the experimental research system to the public electrical grid, which was a milestone at that time.”
Rüther spent another three years as a postdoctoral fellow until he came first in the university's public competition and was hired in 2000.
“I did not become a professor at UFSC until Feb. 1, 2000. For three years I was in a precarious situation as a scholarship recipient, having to renew the scholarship every year and demonstrate the performance of the generator,” he said.
Since the photovoltaic system was installed, UFSC has been talking to Greenpeace about sustainable actions to draw society's attention to solar energy, a safe, clean, renewable and abundantly available energy alternative.
“We had obtained a donation from the state's energy development program (Prodeem) for an off-grid system and a battery storage system on a satellite island of Florianópolis, where the Santo Fortress is located. Antônio de Ratone, a tourist place where energy was supplied by a diesel generator,” said Rüther. “In order to carry out the installation on the island, we requested authorization from the Institute of National Historical and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) and we had to carry out an environmental impact study, which lasted a year.”
Greenpeace and the university organized a solar-powered concert on Nov. 15, 1998, featuring local musical acts.
“And since the system that had been installed at UFSC was just over a year old, we got Celesc to install a pole next to the stage that was set up for this concert and compensating for the energy that the 2-wire system had generated for a whole year,” he said. “After the free concert that was held on the sports fields of the UFSC campus for 25,000 people, we took the isolated system to the island.”

Fortescue has announced it will invest almost AUD 54 million ($35 million) to kickstart a major manufacturing facility in the United States that is expected to serve as a hub for the production of automotive and heavy industry batteries, hydrogen generators, electric vehicle fast chargers and electrolyzers.
Fortescue said the manufacturing facility is being developed in the state of Michigan as part of the company’s plan to rapidly expand its US presence as a direct result of the IRA.
The IRA, which is aimed at ramping up onshore production of renewable energy, electrification and the development of clean energy industries such as green hydrogen, offers subsidies, grants and tax breaks to businesses to establish clean energy projects in the United States.
Fortescue’s new manufacturing centre is expected to benefit directly from IRA tax credits for battery modules, offering approximately AUD 15 /kWh.
Fortescue Executive Chairman and founder Andrew Forrest said the IRA has changed the US from a laggard to a world leader in clean energy, demonstrating that countries which incentivise green energy place an “economic engine” firmly inside their economies.
“The IRA makes the United States the most attractive place in the world for green energy and green manufacturing projects,” he said.

Jurchen Technology and Blue Circle Energy have agreed to build a 60 MW portfolio of solar projects across 11 parishes in Barbados.
The project consists of ground-mounted panels using Jurchen Technology’s PEG EW (PEG) racking solution. The solar plant manufacturer states that its PEG system constructed at an eight-degree tilt produces 225% more land yield than trackers and fixed-tilt systems. This is due to the minimal spacing between modules stemming from their angular design. Racks will also be situated at waist height, using an aerodynamic blueprint that the company says is engineered to withstand extreme wind from hurricanes.
The portfolio will include battery energy storage systems (BESS) either tethered to Barbados’ primary grid or spread across the project’s 50 sites, which will function as community solar gardens. Discussions around tariff rates for the portfolio’s BESS are still ongoing, and a decision needs to be reached before construction of the project begins.
“We’re looking forward to a commercially viable tariff in early 2024,” said Cameron Steinman, president of Blue Circle Energy.
Barbados aims to be the first 100% renewable energy and carbon-neutral island-state by 2030, as outlined in its National Energy Policy document. The report includes 10 goals centered around creating a diverse, affordable and reliable portfolio of renewable energy options that promote the economic enfranchisement of Barbadians in various ways. Increasing the country’s energy independence is another approach to realizing this mission.
Not having to purchase international oil using foreign exchange reserves (primarily dollars) to power plants creates space to allocate those funds toward other meaningful infrastructure initiatives, Steinman said. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, 95% of Barbados’ energy supply was imported in 2020. Oil provided the most significant energy supply at 92%, followed by renewables at 5% and gas at 3%. Bioenergy and solar were the largest renewable energy generators at 62% and 38%, respectively.
“Employing Jurchen Technology’s PEG EW racking solution to construct a 60 MW solar plant portfolio across Barbados represents a significant leap towards our renewable energy goals,” said Lisa Cummins, the minister of energy in Barbados.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/20/we-need-a-domestic-renewable-energy-production-standard-for-pv-installations-in-europe/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",,"NOVEMBER 20, 2023",We need a ‘Domestic Renewable Energy Production’ standard for PV installations in Europe,"All major players in politics and business are uncomfortable with the fact that we are currently almost 100% dependent on imports in key elements of the PV value chain, mainly from China or from Chinese-dominated companies in Southeast Asia. Add to that recent developments in both the United States and Europe that seek to eliminate imports of goods suspected of being produced by ‘forced labor,' slave-like labor conditions. The carbon footprint of imported goods is also to be considered in the future, through an offset levy. In addition, there are geostrategic considerations, especially after our surprising experience with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, that we should not rely on the security of imports from authoritarian and politically aggressive countries.
Therefore, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is great interest in covering the value chain of critically important products, such as PV modules and wind generators, at least in part by domestic production.
I will focus on the case of PV modules in the following opinion piece, although many arguments can be applied to the wind energy sector as well.
The prices for PV modules on the global market have again dropped drastically in the last month. Prices as low as $0.08/W are recorded today, although many studies show that even in China the pure production costs for good c-Si modules are likely to be at least $0.20/W. However, it is surely wrong to call all these fire sales ‘price dumping’ as they are less likely to be the product of a particularly devious policy to eliminate competition. They could also be simply the result of large volumes of overproduction, especially given US import barriers on PV modules which are suspected to include parts made with ‘forced labor'.
At the same time, we are witnessing an attempt to revive domestic PV production in Europe. It is inspired by industry associations European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) and SPE. With the support of the EU Commission, a European Solar Industry Alliance (ESIA) has been formed, uniting about 10 serious projects to rebuild the European solar industry's entire value chain. This spans silicon feedstock to wafers, cells, and modules, including the required glass industry, as well as the necessary power electronics.
There are two basic challenges for this renaissance, which can be identified by the cap-ex and op-ex costs.
As cap-ex, we refer to the capital required to rebuild this industry. Such contributions from local, national, and European sources are known and essential for the establishment of many high-tech production facilities. In individual cases, the European competition rules have to be checked, and exceptions have to be declared. For example, by declaring certain technologies as ‘Important Projects of Common European Interest' IPCEI. Such considerations are underway at many levels, and we can expect to see attractive offers for the location of PV production in various regions of the EU next year.
The situation with op-ex support is more difficult: Even if the cap-ex costs would be covered 100% by public funds, these new industries fail, if their products cannot be sold on the market, in view of the low-price products from Asia, some of which offered even below manufacturing costs. To solve this problem, it is worth considering op-ex subsidies and premiums for domestic products, and a wide variety of ideas are currently moving in this direction. But they have two drawbacks: First, they are a burden on government budgets, which already must support cap-ex costs, and second, it is difficult to predict what level of premiums and subsidies will create a true level playing field in the market. Border taxes such as tariffs generate revenue for the states, but make PV technology more expensive, the cost of which has just in the last years been brought down to the current, attractive cost level by our outstanding technological advances of the last decades.
In recent decades, however, a successful tool has been developed in the US that may prove to be effective in this situation: When promoting the introduction of renewable energies in the US was needed, in many states the utilities were legally obliged by ‘Renewable Energy Portfolio Standards,' (REPs), to provide a certain, annually increasing share of their electricity generation from renewable energies, with clearly defined penalties for non-compliance. As a result, even conservative power producers suddenly became active in the RE market, to ensure that they had the legally required amount of RE in their power mix in subsequent years.
Therefore, in our case, it seems obvious to propose imposing ‘Domestic Renewable Energy Production Standards' on the large installers, which can be easily adapted to the EU Commission's stated goal of providing 40% of domestic PV installations from domestic production by 2030. Such a ‘DREP standard' could, for example, require 10% of installations to be domestically produced by 2026: A large installer would know that in 2026 they can install 10 times the amount of domestic PV modules they could contract for as their total sales. By 2030, the DREP should then grow to 40% in a predictable way, also with clear penalties for falling below the DREP standards. Such a proposal might create problems with rules of the World Trade Organization WTO, but similar problems would arise anyway, if domestic production is supported by direct premiums.
This proposal has several distinct advantages: It does not require €1 of government support payments, it is completely transparent and predictable, and even if at the beginning domestic production should be significantly more expensive than imported modules, this has little impact on the average price, since the share of domestic production is small at the beginning. By 2030, it can be expected that the price differential between domestic multi-GW PV production and imported production should have become small. At some point after 2030, it will certainly be possible to then eliminate this standard.
The demand for domestic PV production would grow by leaps and bounds after the introduction of these DREP standards, but still of course would not stop competition within domestic production.
This model is essentially the same as those already proposed by the ESMC and others for the implementation of the EU Commission's 40% target for 2030. What is new, however, is the realization that this kind of support has already helped us with the introduction of renewable energies, which were expensive at the time, and can now provide us with valuable services again in this decade.

The method involves the modification of a PV panel into a hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) module and can be used for both industrial and residential applications.
“This study introduces a novel approach by harnessing the exhaust air from air conditioning (AC) systems to act as a natural coolant, gently flowing over the rear surface of PV panels,” the researcher said. “It eliminates the need for supplementary fans or added power consumption. Its dual functionality not only contributes to a noteworthy reduction in both the carbon footprint, but also yields cost savings on electricity bills.”
The researchers used polycrystalline BP350 panels from UK-based manufacturer BP Solar and modified them so the rear metal contact (RMC) layer was omitted, creating an air channel between the RMC and an added layer of fiberglass. Consequently, the exhausted air from the AC system is directed below the RMC and confined between the RMC and a layer of fiberglass. The air flows from the front of the module to its back.
“The exhausted air from the AC system is utilized to cool the PV panels. This is achieved by directing the air leaving the exhaust grill into a nozzle, which is then connected to the PV panel,” the researchers said. “The air leaving the PV panel becomes hot, presenting an opportunity for its utilization in thermal applications. This hot air is directed to the dishwasher and blown over the wet dishes.”
Using a set of equations and algorithms, the group of scientists calculated the electric efficiency of the cooled PV panel, as well as the efficiency of the recovered thermal energy.
For those calculations, they assumed a residential house with a floor area of 200 m2 in Beirut, Lebanon, and Doha, Qatar, using an AC unit with an air supply temperature of 13 C and maintaining an indoor air temperature of 23 C. The exhaust air entering the nozzle is assumed to have a temperature of 25 C, resulting from heat gain from the ambient air. Using annual average weather data from both cities, the academics have simulated the effect of the novel system on setups ranging from one to ten PV panels.
“Results show that the cooling process substantially enhances the cell efficiency, reaching approximately 10.1% (Doha) to 10.25% (Beirut) for one PV module,” the academics explained. “As the number of PV panels increases, this efficiency decreases but remains higher than the value obtained without cooling. The relative increase in cell electric efficiency ranges from 15% for one PV module to around 3% for ten PV modules.”
Calculating the recovery of the hot air discharged from the back of the PV panel, the researchers found the thermal efficiency reached 98% in Doha and around 80% in Beirut in the case of one PV module. In the case of ten PV panels, that dropped to 55% and 45%, respectively.
“Results show that the time to dry the dishes decreases with increasing numbers of PV from around 7 hours to around 1 hour,” they added. “When the number of PV increases, the air temperature leaving the PV/T system is higher, thus leading to better drying process.”
Concluding the article, the scientists added that future work should encompass real-world testing to validate system performance. Other research, they said, might be regarding “cost reduction efforts, user-friendly integration methods, efficient monitoring and maintenance systems, and collaborative efforts with policymakers to establish incentives and regulations.”
Their findings can be read in the paper “Dual Harnessing of Air Conditioning Exhaust: PV Cooling and Dishwasher Drying,” published in Energy and Built Environment. The team includes researchers from Los Angeles’ Multiphysics Interaction Lab, Lebanon’s American University of Beirut, the Lebanese International University, as well as Kuwait’s Gulf University for Science and Technology.

More than 250 million households across India have the technical potential to deploy 637 GW of solar energy capacity on rooftops, according to a new independent report by CEEW.
The researchers said that rural areas have a higher technical rooftop potential of 363 GW than urban areas (274 GW) considering the residential rooftop area. Residential willingness to install rooftop solar systems is the highest in Gujarat at 13%, while the national average is 5%.
The report stated that deploying just one-third of the 637 GW solar potential could meet the residential sector’s entire electricity demand of 310 TWh.
The overall technical potential reduces to one-fifth (118 GW) after factoring in the current electricity consumption of households.
“Most residential consumers fall into low-consumption slabs and solar may not be economically feasible for them without financial support even though it is technically possible,” said CEEW.
The potential reduces further to 11 GW when no capital subsidy is considered.
“The payback period for rooftop solar is restricted to five years and we factor in consumers’ willingness to buy rooftop solar,” explained the researchers.
However, with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s capital subsidy, the researchers noted the potential to increase to 32 GW as the subsidy makes the solar systems feasible for more consumers.

Reactive power control allows better management of photovoltaic power spikes in the grid. The XT36 measures 359 mm x 273 mm x 56 mm and weighs 7 kg.
The YS18 single-phase microinverter for residential solar installations provides an AC output power of up to 1,800 VA. It connects to four solar power modules (2×2 in series). With a maximum input current of 20 A, it is also engineered to match modules up to 670 Wp+.
The November edition of pv magazine is dominated by the issue of global oversupply and examines the effects of a solar glut in the European Union, the United States, and other markets. We turn the spotlight on PV developments in South Korea, Taiwan, and Africa and update readers on technological progress in thin films, kerfless wafering, and mass produced heterojunction PV.
The peak efficiency is 97%, and the nominal MPPT efficiency is 99.5%. The YS18 measures 284 mm x 234 mm x 50.2 mm and weighs 4.3 kg.
The components in both XT36 and YS18 micro-inverters are encapsulated with silicone to reduce stress on electronics, facilitate thermal dissipation, enhance waterproof properties, and ensure maximum reliability of the system.
