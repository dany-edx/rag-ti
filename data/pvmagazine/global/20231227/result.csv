Although total global solar capacity will continue to increase rapidly over the next decade, the pace of installation growth will begin to slow in 2024, compared to rates seen in recent years.
According to the head of Wood Mackenzie's global solar division, if the forecasts for 2023 are met, the average annual growth of PV installations from 2019 to this year will have been 28%, including a 56% increase in 2023 compared to 2022.
However, on average, the current pace will be maintained and there will be no annual growth from 2024 to 2028, which will include some years with contractions. Wood Mackenzie is forecasting 270 GW of new solar installations worldwide for this year, while the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects additions of 349 GW for 2023.
Global solar market growth follows the typical S-curve. In recent years, growth has increased rapidly at the steepest part of the curve. Starting in 2024, the sector will pass the inflection point, characterized by a slower growth pattern. The global solar market is still many times larger than it was a few years ago, but it is natural for an industry to follow this growth path as it matures.
Not all regions are currently at the same point on the S-curve. Africa and the Middle East, for example, have a long way to go before reaching their growth inflection points. Two large markets are driving this growth pattern on a global scale, however: Asia-Pacific, dominated by China, and Europe. It is worth remembering that any change of course in China has a strong impact on the world market since the country leads new capacity additions, with some 180 GW that will be connected this year.
What could affect this slowdown is the global commitment to the energy transition. On December 13, world governments meeting at the UN COP28 climate convention in Dubai agreed to what was described as a “historic” declaration, setting for the first time a target for the transition from fossil fuels. This objective establishes a change of course for the global energy system. Oil, gas and coal consumption continues to grow, although more slowly, and all three fuels reached new all-time highs in 2023. In addition, COP28 agreed to triple renewables by 2030.
Global coal demand will increase by 1.4% in 2023, exceeding 8.5 billion tons for the first time. While in the European Union and the United States consumption is expected to increase by around 20%, in India and China it will remain strong, with 8% and 5% respectively in 2023. By 2026, however, it is expected that global coal consumption will decrease by 2.3% compared to 2023 levels.
Renewable energy is also booming. According to Wood Mackenzie, global wind and solar energy production in 2023 is 55% higher than in 2020.

Located in the district of Ayaş, some 60 kilometers from the Turkish capital, the Ayaş AgriPV project was initiated by the Ayaş District Directorate of Agriculture and Forestry, the ODTÜ-GÜNAM Center for Solar Energy Research and Applications, and a local farmer.
The project is the first and most comprehensive application in Turkey of a solar power plant with a solar tracking system on an open agricultural field, according to ODTÜ-GÜNAM, part of the Middle East Technical University (ODTÜ/METU).
The 122 kWp agrivoltaics system was configured with 14 lines oriented in the east-west direction, incorporating a single-axis sun tracking system set at +55 and -55 degrees. Vehicles, including trailers and tractors, can operate under the agriPV system.
During the first-year trial, six different crops – tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, carrots, spinach, and red cabbage – were carefully chosen and planted in accordance with the local crop pattern of Ayaş. Agricultural activities are being monitored concurrently in the reference area, which has the same surface area as the agrivoltaics site.
In addition to energy production, researchers are measuring many environmental parameters within the scope of the project, including irrigation, soil moisture and temperature. Data collection is being conducted to facilitate efficiency analyses and cultivation trials of various agricultural products are scheduled over the next four years.
ODTÜ-GÜNAM Module Technologies Division researchers, led by Associate Professor Dr. Talat Özden, will gather and disseminate in national and international platforms the analyses encompassing agricultural productivity, energy efficiency, dual-use efficiency of land, LCOE, and income-expense calculations. All results obtained from the studies will also be presented as annual reports.
Part of ODTÜ-GÜNAM’s Livinglab initiative, the project will make it possible for national and international researchers to easily test products and production processes by developing a tracker system with a control algorithm specially designed for the crops they desire to cultivate. The infrastructure has been designed to facilitate these types of research and collaborations. The remote access, programming, and monitoring of the system within the framework of Livinglab also allows rapid responses to many researchers.
Turkish companies KalyonPV, CW-Enerji and Gumbel Group also contributed to the project.

The product, dubbed Solar Hybrid Water Heating V series, comes in four versions with capacities of 100 liters, 150 liters, 200 liters, and 300 liters.
“The photovoltaic water heater is directly connected to the solar panel, powered by solar mainly on sunny days and AC on rainy days, and can be automatically switched,” the company said in a statement. “The AC/DC dual heating element utilizes solar energy for power generation, with a conversion efficiency of up to 99%, greatly reducing the energy consumption of the AC grid.”
The AC heater has a capacity of 2,000 W across all models. The company, however, recommends 1,000 W of solar panels for the 100-liter model and 2,500 W for the 300-liter model. For the 150 liters, it recommends 1,500 W of solar panels, and 2,000 W for the 200 liters.
According to the company, the smallest model takes 4 hours to heat the water to 40 C. In the 150 liters and 300 liters models, it will take 5 hours, while in the 200 liters it will take 5.5 hours. The company also emphasizes that users can remotely monitor and set the water heater via WiFi.
“By using a pressure-bearing water tank design, the water outlet pressure is high, and there is no need to install an additional water pump for pressurization,” the manufacturer added. ”The solar water tank can be easily installed inside the house and is not affected by outdoor temperature.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/27/how-to-integrate-residential-solar-plus-storage-with-vehicle-to-home-systems/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,OCEANIA",LIOR KAHANA,"DECEMBER 27, 2023",How to integrate residential solar-plus-storage with vehicle-to-home systems,"Scientists led by the University of South Australia have developed an optimization method to reduce annual energy costs for households using Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) technology and rooftop PV.
V2H is an energy transfer model in which households can use their electric vehicle (EV) battery to power their home load.
“This study proposes a novel household energy cost optimization method for a grid-connected home with EV, renewable energy source and battery energy storage (BES),” they explained. “To achieve electricity tariff-sensitive home energy management, multi-location EV charging and daily driving demand are considered to properly schedule the EV charging and V2H events.”
The novel model assumes a home energy management system (HEMS) that decides whether to import or export energy to the grid based on prices. It can import energy from the grid, the BES, or the EV and export energy to all of them. In addition, it can import energy from a PV system and EVs located outside the house.
The model assumes that the system operates under time-of-use (TOU) tariffs, where pricing depends on demand. It adopts the TOU tariffs of two Australian utilities, AGL and IO Energy, compares them. The difference is that while IO offers higher peak prices than AGL, it also provides lower off-peak prices.
“When the PV generation exceeds the combined household consumption and EV charging demand, then the excess PV-generated power is first used to charge the BES; when the BES is fully charged, then the excess PV power is returned to the grid,” the researcher explained. “When the PV power output is less than the combined household consumption and EV charging demand, then the proposed HEMS strategy works in one of three ways based on three price periods within the TOU tariff.”

According to the research team, the first way applies to the last hour of the off-peak period, and then power is imported from the grid. The second way refers to the rest of the off-peak period and times when tariffs are between peak and off-peak prices. Then, the BES is discharged to supply power to the home before importing from the grid.
The third and final method is activated at peak times. “First, V2H is activated to supply power to the home before discharging BES; when the designated lower limit of the EV's state-of-charge (SoC) for V2H operation is reached, and the BES is fully discharged, power is imported from the grid,” the researchers explained.
In addition, the method rules that in the last hour of the off-peak pricing, the BES can be charged by both the PV and the grid and does not discharge at all. For the rest of the day, the system can be charged from excess PV generation and discharged to the home.
“Unlike the home BES, the charging and discharging of EV are constrained by additional variables, including users' home departure and arrival times, daily travel distance, and parking locations. In this study, two usage types of residential EVs are examined: work EV and casual EV,” the research group added. “Work EV is a privately owned vehicle mainly used for commuting to/from work and parked at workplaces during working hours. Casual EV is a privately owned vehicle used for daily activities other than work (e.g., shopping, education, etc.) and will be flexibly parked in public parking places during the day.”
Furthermore, based on the work/casual EV profiles, the model presents a few operation scenarios. In scenario 1, the working user charges the EV at home on workdays and during off-peak on non-workdays. In scenario 2, the working user charges the EV at the workplace for free during working hours on workdays and at home during off-peak on non-workdays. In scenario 3, the casual user charges the EV at home during the off-peak on both workdays and non-workdays. In scenario 4, the casual user charges the EV at a public parking place for one hour daily on both workdays and non-workdays.
All the scenarios were defined under the assumption that charging is available for free for the first hour in public parking places.

The above conditions were then inserted into a software simulation with a specific case study based on a household with a load of 17 kWh/day. The car chosen was a Nissan Leaf, with a daily travel distance of 37 km, based on the Australian average. Optimal PV capacity was calculated to be 4-8 kW and BES capacity was found to be 7-11 kWh, changing per the four usage scenarios described above.
“The results demonstrate that when out-of-home EV charging is available for free, then the use of V2H technology is more beneficial than home charging,” the researchers stated. “V2H can help reduce the cost of energy (COE) by 16.7% for workplace charging  and 25% for public charging, both compared to the COE without the use of V2H.”
Those results are achieved for the AGL tariff, noted the researchers, as IO provided a slightly lower reduction. “The use of V2H energy transfer reduces the annual imported energy for all the out-of-home charging scenarios considered in this study, with a maximum possible reduction of 36% for the AGL TOU in the public charging scenario,” they added.
Their findings were presented in the study “Vehicle-to-home operation and multi-location charging of electric vehicles for energy cost optimization of households with photovoltaic system and battery energy storage,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy.

The 10-foot system is modular, offering from 68 kWh up to 204 kWh of usable energy.
Power Bloxx comes in different configurations with one or two inverters for the maximum PV input power of 75 kW and 150 kW and AC output of 50 kW and 100 kW respectively. The maximum AC output current per installed inverter is 83 A.
The nominal voltage stands at 409 V, with a usable capacity from 81 Ah to 492 Ah. As for the nominal capacity, the depth of discharge is 72%. According to the manufacturer, the system can deliver 5,500 full charge and discharge cycles for a residual capacity of 60%.
The system’s dimensions are 3.06 m x 2.90 m x 2.44 m. It weighs 4,328 kg.
It has an integrated air conditioning system and operates in temperatures from -20 C to 50 C. Power Bloxx has an IP55 enclosure protection rating and can be installed outdoors, including in coastal areas and high altitudes in mountainous regions. The system comes with a 10-year warranty.
“For the time being, we are offering only the 10-feet version of Power Bloxx, but a 20-feet version is most likely to be developed by 2025,” the company’s spokesperson tells pv magazine.
Power Bloxx is designed as an emergency power generator with a long runtime. It has a UPS switching time of less than 20 milliseconds. In addition, it is well suited for self-consumption optimization, peak shaving, and zero feed-in applications.

The researchers demonstrated, in particular, a method to increase the adhesion performance of EVA and POE on steel structures.
“We replaced the back side glass with a steel plate. So the stacked structure of the PV module would be glass/EVA/cells/EVA/steel,” the research lead author, Young-Su Kim, told pv magazine, noting that his team also improved the lamination process and applied a surface treatment to the steel plates.
The team studied the adhesion performance of twelve samples with the proposed configuration in standard peel force tests. The samples were prepared as follows, six EVA and six POE, with half again processed at 170 C and 150 C. Furthermore, the surfaces of colored steel plate samples were “scratched” through a “mild” and “strong” process, respectively, or were left unscratched.
The results of the EVA tests confirmed earlier research that showed that the adhesion strength of EVA is increased by raising the lamination temperature by 20 C. As for the samples combining EVA laminated at 150 C in combination with treated steel surfaces, the team observed a 20-fold increase in the “strong” scratched samples in comparison to non-scratched samples. “Meanwhile, in the case of lamination at 170 C, even mild scratching resulted in a significant increase in adhesion,” said the researchers.
As for the POE encapsulants, the lamination temperature was not as critical to adhesion performance as the surface treatment. The researchers said that in the case of POE, even a surface without scratches exhibited strong adhesion. “As the intensity of scratching increased, adhesion also improved, reaching a notable 6.1 N/mm under conditions of pronounced scratching. This level of adhesion was in proximity to that observed between EVA and glass surfaces,” the researchers explained.
The team sees the research as a step towards being able to use colored steel plates in BIPV modules instead of glass or conventional backsheets. The so-called glass-to-steel (G2S) design addresses some of the challenges of using PV on building facades, note the researchers. For example, G2S modules have potentially superior aesthetics, greater durability, and a fire resistance performance at least as good as dual glass modules.
When asked about the next steps, Kim said that the team has fabricated some G2S-type modules based on the same split in the research paper for further testing. “We are testing some reliability tests such as damp heat and thermo-cycle tests. We expect to achieve higher reliability in the test group than in the controlled group,” he said.
The details of the work are presented in the study “Analysis of adhesion characteristics of steel back plates and encapsulants for fire-proof BIPV modules,” published in Results in Engineering.
The project team also includes scientists from the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology and Korea University.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/27/new-research-shows-potential-of-solar-cells-based-cement-based-radiative-coolers/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 27, 2023",New research shows potential of solar cells based on cement radiative coolers,"Researchers at the Politecnico di Torino in Italy have sought to quantify the potential positive effects of radiative coolers made of cement paste on the performance of photovoltaic cells. These coolers are often used for thermal management in buildings and have strong potential due to the low costs of the material they are made with.
Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from the atmosphere and emits more. As a result, the surface loses heat and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
“The goal of this work was to improve the detailed balance model commonly employed in the literature to assess radiative coolers for solar cells,” the research's corresponding author, Matteo Cagnoni, told pv magazine. “In particular, we were interested in the inclusion of non-radiative recombination channels and the thermal contact resistance at the cell/cooler interface.”
According to Cagnoni, cement-based radiative coolers have poor adhesion properties, which may cause a large thermal contact resistance that might hinder heat flow from the cell to the cooler, hence preventing cooling.
“If this challenge is overcome, we believe that this concept will be very interesting in the context of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) – as a matter of fact, there are reports in the literature of solar cells built onto building structural elements such as shingles,” he explained, noting that the costs of such a module may be only slightly higher than those without the cooler, thanks to the reliance on cheap, scalable and robust cement-based materials.
In the paper “Extended detailed balance modeling toward solar cells with cement-based radiative coolers,” published in Progress in Photovoltaics, the research group demonstrated that the cement-based coolers, which they originally developed in 2022, could approach the spectrum of the ideal broad-band emitter for solar cells.
The scientists incorporated Auger (AUG) and Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) nonradiative recombination into their modeling.
Auger recombination consists of a non-radiative process that reduces photovoltaic cell efficiency below the ideal radiative limit. It consists of the energy given to a third carrier which is excited to a higher energy level without moving to another energy band. This energy is dissipated not by photon emission, but rather by raising the kinetic energy of another free carrier.
SRH nonradiative recombination, which is also known as trap-assisted recombination, describes energy states that are called traps and are created by the electron in transition between bands. This electron passes through a new energy state created within the band gap by a dopant or a defect in the crystal lattice.
“Beside trivially reducing the overall power conversion efficiency, these mechanisms also increase the cell operating temperature and the reduction rate of its efficiency with increasing temperature,” the scientists stated. “Neglecting nonradiative recombination may lead to an underestimation of the benefits provided by a radiative cooler, with these benefits being slightly weakened, but far from negligible, in cells well-described by the radiative limit.”
They also claimed to have demonstrated that a thermal contact resistance at the cell/cooler interface creates the conditions for perfect thermal coupling and isothermal system, complete thermal decoupling, and partial reduction of the cooling effect. “The finite heat transfer coefficient is going to weaken these benefits, but we have defined design guidelines that should enable device engineers to identify the minimum value of this parameter needed to obtain the desired cooling performance,” they concluded.
Radiative cooling was recently applied to solar panel cooling by researchers from the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom, Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait.
