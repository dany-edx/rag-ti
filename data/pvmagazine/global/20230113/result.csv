The European joint venture will open a PV module factory in Hollerich, Luxemburg, at the end of this year. In the first phase, the facility will have 50 MW of capacity, producing nearly 100,000 solar modules per year, according to a statement from the government of Luxembourg. Solarcells plans to double the factory’s capacity to 100 MW by 2026.
Each “made-in-Luxembourg” solar panel will cost €15 ($16.20) to €18 more than panels made in Asia, Socom President Marc Thein said during the factory’s announcement press conference, without disclosing the technical details of the panels. Evocells will reportedly play a leading role in purchasing raw materials and streamlining supply chain management, while prioritizing materials of European origin.
“It is easier to produce locally in order to be less dependent on the supply of components and deliveries from the other side of the world,” said Thein.
The new facility will require an initial investment of €5 million ($5.4 million) and will create around 20 jobs.
“Solar energy is booming in Luxembourg … this energy source is not only clean and helps the Grand Duchy to achieve its renewable energy development objectives, but it is also produced locally and is part of the solutions to break out of dependence on Russian fossil fuels,” said Luxembourg Energy Minister Claude Turmes. “The Socom project, which aims to produce photovoltaic panels on the national territory, helps us to strengthen this independence: from the production of the panels to the production of solar energy, the local energy transition is accelerated.”

“The design replaces film capacitors with machine-placeable ceramic capacitors and uses planar magnetics,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The US manufacturer said the SiC metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) have 20 times faster switching frequency than silicon insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). The two devices have power outputs of 200 kW and 400 kW. The SiC components provide the 400 kW inverter with a power density of 4 kW/kg, according to the company.
The Brek IS400 measures 762 mm x 381 mm x 635 mm. Brek estimates its weight at 100 kg, but it notes that some parts are still missing from the calculation. The device has an efficiency of up to 99%. It has a DC power voltage from 875 V to 1,500 V and an ambient operating temperature ranging from -40 C to 60 C.
The IS200 device has the same efficiency and operating temperature, but measures 381 mm x 381 mm x 635 mm and weighs around 50 kg. It has one maximum power point tracking (MPPT) input, while the IS400 has two. The maximum input current DC per MPPT is 222 A.
Berk claims the IS400 has a lifetime of around 15 years, with lab tests reportedly showing an improvement in the meantime to failure compared to conventional silicon. It said it will submit the inverter for UL testing in the fourth quarter of 2023. It expects to release it in the first half of 2024.
Its silicon carbide-based composite architecture technology for string inverters was one of the finalists in the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) American-Made Solar Prize. Silicon carbide-based inverters are known for having higher power density and lower overall system costs than traditional inverters. However, defects at the interface between the silicon carbide and the insulating silicon dioxide material are still issues for such devices.

“Flywheel energy storage systems can capitalize on storing energy during off-peak periods of the day and releasing them during peak usage periods,” researcher Roy Francis Navea told pv magazine. “In addition, aside from the basic electric energy source through the grid, the flywheel can also store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar. Hence, this technology fits a tropical country like the Philippines.”
The researchers describer their findings in “Challenges and Opportunities of Flywheel Energy Storage in the Philippines,” which was recently published in the International Journal of Emerging Trends in Engineering Research. They looked at how the landscape and geography of the country could affect the logistics of flywheel installations such as the M32 flywheels developed by Amber Kinetics, especially in off-grid areas. 
The M32 system is a 5,000 kg, four-hour Kinetic Energy Storage System (KESS) flywheel technology. It can store 32 kWh of energy in a 2 ton steel rotor. It has a round-trip efficiency of 86% and can be stacked in series to reach capacities of hundreds of megawatts, according to the manufacturer.
“The use of steel, absence of hazardous chemicals in the flywheel’s operation, and low operating temperature also mean that there is a minimal risk of a chemical fire,” the researchers explained. “It can be cycled multiple times a day without suffering a degradation in its performance and can last more than 20 years without being replaced.”
Francis Navea said flywheel energy requires a big land area and in the course of development, there might be limited spaces to install and build these facilities, though, there are designs and some strategic proposals on how to position and allocate flywheel farms.
“In terms of its technical aspect, we are working on the analysis of the materials used in the flywheel capsules, the integration of its systems with other energy sources, and the link to modern digital electronics, and data analytics,” he also stated.
The research group is currently in the process of starting the finite element analysis of flywheels.
“The validation of their link to renewable energy sources is in its final stage,” he concluded.

Swiss startup Sun-Ways is currently developing PV systems that can be placed between railroad tracks. It is working on a project that is scheduled to go online in May 2023. It consists of a mechanically detachable PV plant that will occupy a track section owned by Swiss railway operator Transports Publics Neuchâtelois SA.
The company developed the mechanical concept in cooperation with the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and Swiss innovation agency Innosuisse. It said the PV system can be pre-assembled in a factory and then loaded onto a special train. The solar modules are then rolled out like a carpet between the tracks. The PV system can also be removed at any time to enable maintenance work.
If the solution works, the potential in Switzerland alone is enormous, the company said, noting that the country has a railway network spanning almost 7,000 kilometers. Up to 1 TWh of solar power could be generated in this way, it claimed.
Sun-Ways is also looking beyond its home market. It noted that there is a rail network of around 260,000 kilometers across Europe and about 1.16 million kilometers throughout the world. It said it has already made contact with unspecified investors in Europe and the United States about offering its solution on an industrial scale.

The Guyanese authorities said the tender will be divided into three lots. It will enable the selection of eight PV projects, the government said, without disclosing additional technical and financial details.
The deadline to submit project proposals is March 6. The procurement exercise is part of the Guyana Utility Scale Solar Photovoltaic (GUYSOL) Programme.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Guyana had an installed PV capacity of around 8 MW by the end of 2021. The country's ambitious Low-Carbon Development Strategy aims to meet all power demand from renewables by 2025 and will require the replacement of 200 MW of thermal power generation capacity.

It originally planned to reduce the tariffs by between 1% and 3%.
“The domestic photovoltaic industry is still partially affected by the price of raw materials and labor shortage,” the MOEA said in a statement. “However, PV system prices will gradually stabilize in the second half of this year.”
Residential installations with capacities ranging from 1 kW to 10 kW will be given tariffs of up to TWD 5.8952 ($0.20)/kWh. The Taiwanese government said the tariffs will be maintained to encourage the industry to invest in new solar capacity. It made the same move at the end of June 2022, when it confirmed the January-June FITs for the second half of the year.
The Taiwanese government has revealed that the country reached a cumulative installed solar capacity of around 7.7 GW at the end of 2021, with new annual additions reaching 1.9 GW. Recently, the Taipei Times reported that new PV capacity additions for 2022 likely reached 2 GW.
The authorities aim to install 20 GW of solar by 2025, including 3 GW of rooftop PV capacity and 17 GW of ground-mounted solar capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/13/cooling-solar-modules-with-vacuum-pressure/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDONESIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 13, 2023",Cooling solar modules with vacuum pressure,"Researchers at the Politeknik Negeri Ujung Pandang in Indonesia have proposed the use of vacuum pressure to reduce the operating temperature of PV modules.
“Our vacuum technique is still in the development stage,” researcher Suryanto Suryanto told pv magazine. “but our plan is to bring it to the market at some point.”
The passive cooling method involves a casing to apply negative pressure around the PV module. Negative pressure is pressure that is less than the existing atmospheric pressure and is a condition under which the air pressure is lower in one place in comparison to another.
“If the pressure of a room is lowered, it will cause the room temperature to decrease,” the scientists explained.
They applied this to a solar module a casing frame made of board material with a thickness of 18 mm. The casing is covered with 5 mm glass – resistant enough to withstand negative pressure. It uses a valve to allow air to be sucked from the casing by a vacuum pump and a pressure sensor to measure the pressure conditions in the PV casing chamber.
The researchers used a temperature sensor to monitor the top and bottom surfaces of the PV module and a temperature logger to collect all data. They compared the performance of the cooled panel with that of a reference module without cooling at an ambient air temperature of around 35 C to 36 C.
They found that the cooled module had a current ranging from 0.89 A to 0.91 A, while the reference module was just 0.62 A. They found that the temperature at the top of the PV panel under vacuum pressure reached a temperature of between 29 C and 30 C, while that of the uncooled module was between 44 C and 45 C. ”
Suryanto said that adding this cooling technique to a PV system could result in an additional cost of $30/kW to $50/kW.
“Regarding plans for mass production we will seriously consider them in the near future, of course with the cooperation of interested industry parties,” he concluded. “A further investigation on the tech costs should be conducted in future work.”

The figures are still not final, but there are indications that Austria installed more than 1 GW of solar in 2022.
Despite this growth, the Austrian federal government plans to further accelerate the expansion of photovoltaics with a record budget of €600 million ($650 million) in subsidies, according to PV Austria. In addition to the higher subsidies, the government plans to simplify approvals for PV systems.
Thus far, the authorities have included two funding tracks in the Renewable Energy Sources Expansion Act (EAG) – funds for rebates and market premiums. Now the government plans to quickly implement an additional program for PV projects. PV Austria said this “fast-track” funding scheme will include €268 million.
“This quick measure comes at exactly the right time. Projects that are in the drawers, but are unclear due to limited funding, should be able to be implemented quickly,” said Vera Immitzer, PV Austria's managing director.
However, the details of the funding program still need to be worked out by a special committee under the Ministry of Climate Protection. In addition, the government plans to develop the “Renewable Energy Expansion Acceleration Act” (EABG) to simplify the approval process.
The federal and state governments plans to closely cooperate on spatial planning. In the future, only one central office will process all permits throughout Austria. The law will likely be drafted in the coming weeks. However, PV Austria said it is still not entirely convinced that it will be successful.
“In addition to the federal government, the federal states and active spatial energy planning are needed for the expansion of renewables,” explained Immitzer. “The Renewables Expansion Acceleration Act can be a good basis for this – provided that everyone involved works together with commitment.”

The question is when. For all the talk of simple, low-cost manufacturing processes, we are yet to see perovskite solar devices produced at anything like the scale where they could claim meaningful market share. Scientists led by Australia’s University of Queensland examined the technological barriers that are still in the way of perovskite PV production, breaking it down into the needs of specific applications.
In its paper “Next-generation applications for integrated perovskite solar cells,” published in Communications Materials, the group outlines several challenges for the production of perovskite materials, including long-term stability and the use of lead. While arguments have been made that the amount of lead used in perovskites is unlikely to have major health or environmental impacts, the group here notes that the ability to tune the bandgap and control the parts of the light spectrum a cell absorbs is an important property for the development of commercial, and one that typically requires a least partial replacement of lead with tin.
“Sn-based perovskites also exhibit lower carrier lifetime, diffusion length and poorer stability,” the group explains. “Therefore, alternative strategies to design low-bandgap perovskites should be explored including the replacement of Sn with other stable metals and surface passivation techniques.”
For perovskite tandem cells in particular, new electrode materials with higher conductivity need to be developed, and here the group recommends increased efforts in investigation of carbon materials to fulfil this role.
The paper also outlines opportunities that perovskites could open up in terms of integration with other applications – from more conventional ideas such as building-integrated PV, to outlandish and less explored ideas like solar modules with integrated storage, devices to power space exploration and very high efficiency devices with three or more cells stacked on top of each other.
In the building-integrated space, perovskite devices bring the potential for much lower weight and more flexibility in terms of shape, along with semitransparency and other desirable properties. But these need to developed while also overcoming the challenges the technology faces in every case.
“There is no doubt that PSCs have appealing characteristics for the development of BIPVs,” said the group. “However, the key challenge lies in realizing all of the following features in a single system: high PCE, excellent device stability and rapid response characteristics.”

It combines the advantages of lithium-ion technology – namely, high energy density and rapid response – with the benefits of flow batteries, such as a lower levelized cost of storage.
“By combining the concepts, we have overcome the inherent shortcomings of lithium sulfur battery which have prevented it from being successfully commercialized at scale,” StorTera COO Brenda Park told pv magazine.
With an energy density of 250 Wh/L, the SLIQ is touted as the most energy dense flow battery now under development.
“Due to its high energy density, the SLIQ can replace existing lithium technology in any many applications while providing a much longer lifetime (up to 30 years) with minimal degradation of efficiency,” said Park.
The technology purportedly provides millisecond response times and up to eight hours of energy storage for more than 20 years and a minimum of 7,500 cycles. The system is said to offer improved safety with no cooling requirements and high flash point materials.
“We are striving to make this a truly sustainable battery technology, building a circular economy around it using recovered or recycled raw materials where possible and by making it as reusable as possible,” said Park.
StorTera’s system works by pumping energy-dense single liquid through its proprietary membrane stack to provide long-duration storage. The single liquid design means less system components, whereas low-cost materials and manufacturing techniques further contribute to cost savings. StorTera has a stated goal of reaching capital costs of approximately GBP 120 ($146.20)/kW and GBP 75/kWh when commercialized.
“As it can provide both millisecond response time and long duration energy storage, it is well suited to grid scale applications and/or integration with solar or wind farms,” Park said. “Combined with our intelligent control platform, the SLIQ offers distinct advantages to commercial and industrial applications where it can be optimized continuously according to grid and weather data or by predicting demand peaks.”
In late November, StorTera secured about GBP 5 million from the UK government to help build a large-scale, eight- hour demonstrator of the SLIQ, which will be installed in Edinburgh in 2024. The prototype SLIQ will use a novel cylindrical cell architecture in a modular format to optimize the manufacture, installation, and maintenance of the system.
With a focus on sustainability, the system will use recyclable materials and by-products of the wood industry. Toward the end of the project, eight modular units will be combined to build a 200 kW/1.6 MWh demonstrator SLIQ.
“While developing the SLIQ, we have been providing bespoke small and medium scale lithium ferro phosphate (LFP) battery systems integrated with our intelligent platform to public sector, domestic and commercial customers in the UK. We have also piloted innovative smart grids in the UK and Canada that show the benefits that intelligent energy storage can offer to customers,” Park said. “Our commercial projects are paving the way for the SLIQ when it is commercialized in the next few years.”

Argonne National Laboratory has developed a dynamic geospatial mapping tool as a free, open resource to identify suitable locations for solar, wind, and other clean energy infrastructure projects. Based on desired parameters, the tool will generate a “heat map” of ideal locations. 
Users of the Geospatial Energy Map (GEM) can locate sites with high suitability for clean power generation and energy transmission corridors in the United States. Project developers can browse and download geographical information systems (GIS) data layers or create a customized suitability model to target areas for energy development. 
GEM is backed by large sets of relevant geospatial data, including energy resources and infrastructure, demographics, boundaries, utility territories, and more. The tool comes loaded with over 190 data layers, and nearly 100 modeling criteria. Users can select for population density, proximity to nearest substation, slope, wildfire risk, and low-income household percentage.
As a new feature, the map can quickly orient itself to a focus technology like solar, wind, or EV charging infrastructure. This allows for quick loading of multiple data layers directly relevant to the technology under development.
GEM includes preconfigured models for over 40 types of energy infrastructure. Land-based wind turbines or utility-scale photovoltaic solar are two examples of technology presets. The preset data layer groupings provide a starting point that users can then further customize to their desired specifications. 
“Choosing where to build utility-scale renewable energy development is a tremendously important decision with effects that reverberate beyond the generation of electricity,” said Michael Levin, a GEM user studying renewable energy landscapes at Columbia University. “GEM not only makes energy suitability maps public but allows for the user to customize the model used to produce such a map.” 
GEM was first publicly launched in 2013 as the Energy Zones Mapping Tool (EZMT), and has since been redesigned, rebranded and reengineered. It is hosted by the US Department of Energy (DoE) Argonne National Laboratory with funding from the DoE’s Office of Electricity. 
“In GEM we applied lessons learned from almost 10 years hosting the EZMT, including making it easier to learn and use, updating the software architecture, and choosing a name fitting its current scope of uses,” said Jim Kuiper, principal geospatial engineer and GEM technical coordinator. 
A diverse community of users are expected to make use of GEM, much like its predecessor EZMT. Kentucky’s Office of Energy Policy used the EZMT for prototyping its Solar Site Suitability on Reclaimed Mine Lands tool. Other users include private industry, public service commissions, regional transmission organizations, national laboratories, educational institutions, and energy and natural resource nonprofits.
Argonne will host a virtual tutorial of GEM on Tuesday, Jan. 17 at 2 pm (CT=. Click here to attend the webinar via Microsoft Teams.
