Cracks forming in the electrodes of batteries are one cause of performance loss over time, and an issue that many manufacturers are looking to engineer out of the batteries using new materials more resistant to cracking. Research published this week, however, suggests that getting rid of cracks in the cathode may have an unwanted side effect.
“Many companies are interested in making ‘million-mile' batteries using particles that do not crack,” explained Yiyang Li, assistant professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Michigan. “Unfortunately, if the cracks are removed, the battery particles won’t be able to charge quickly without the extra surface area from those cracks.”
Conventional wisdom states that the charging speed for batteries should be improved by using cathodes made from smaller particles, since these have a higher surface area to volume ratio, shortening the distance lithium-ions have to travel.
Li and colleagues put this assumption to the test using sophisticated techniques to track the behavior of individual particles as the battery is charged. “Back when I was in graduate school, a colleague studying neuroscience showed me these arrays that they used to study individual neurons. I wondered if we can also use them to study battery particles, which are similar in size to neurons,” said Li.

The setup involved a 2x2cm chip containing 100 microelectrodes, onto which the group scattered nickel-manganese-cobalt cathode (NMC) particles. Using a needle which they say is “around 70 times thinner than a human hair,” the scientists could move the individual particles onto an electrode, allowing them to charge and discharge the particles individually. The group worked with NMC “532” material, containing 50% nickel, 30% manganese and 20% cobalt, and say they would expect similar results for any type of NMC cathode.
The experiment is described in full in the paper “Direct measurements of size-independent lithium diffusion and reaction times in individual polycrystalline battery particles,” published in Energy & Environmental Science. The results showed that the charging speed was not affected by particle size.
Li and Jinhong Min, who carried out the experiments, theorize that this could be down to the larger particles behaving more like a collection of small particles when the cathode cracks, Or that lithium-ions are able to move more quickly at the grain boundary. “Our results overturn the dominant picture of lithium transport in the most widely-used cathode material,” the two stated. “If this electrolyte cracking model is accurate, then our results show that intergranular cracking, long believed to be strongly detrimental to cycle life, is in fact essential for the ability of polycrystalline particles to (dis)charge at reasonable cycling rates.”

They used a gradient hydrothermal process, synthesizing molybdenum and the catalyst at different temperatures to form a microsphere structure. Yufeng Zhao, a Shanghai University professor, said that the nanoneedles in the structure provide abundant active sites for efficient electron transfer, leading to enhanced hydrogen bubble release. Their study, published in Nano Research, says that molybdenum reduces the interaction between nickel-cobalt phosphide and intermediates, resulting in improved hydrogen evolution performance. The researchers said that this discovery could have applications in large-scale hydrogen production.
Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) scientists have developed a novel method for producing molecular hydrogen from dehydrogenating feedstock chemicals, such as methanol. They said that they used a commercially available ruthenium complex as a catalyst under mild conditions to generate hydrogen via a clean chemical dehydrogenation reaction. The researchers plan to use the hydrogen to make highly value-added chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
APEX Group has entered into an agreement to purchase three plots of land in Lubmin from EWN Entsorgungswerk für Nuklearanlagen, with the aim of installing up to 600 MW of electrolyzer capacity. The first construction stage is scheduled for completion in 2027. APEX will be responsible for constructing the plants and will subsequently operate them as the owner. The 100% subsidiary of exceet Group stated that there are ongoing discussions with other interested parties at the site to jointly develop the required infrastructure for electricity and water supply, as well as wastewater disposal. During the final construction phase, the plant is expected to produce up to 43,000 metric tons of hydrogen annually, utilizing renewable electricity sourced from northern Germany.
RWE has entered into a contract with a consortium comprised of Ansaldo Energia from Italy and Técnicas Reunidas from Spain to construct a hydrogen-ready combined cycle power plant. The plant is planned to have a capacity of 800 MW and an efficiency of 62% and will be situated on RWE's existing site in Weisweiler, near Cologne, Germany. The final investment decision for the project is contingent upon the completion of the regulatory framework in Germany, expected by 2025. As part of their preparation, the companies will commence the permitting processes immediately, aiming to begin electricity production by the end of the decade once the appropriate framework conditions in Germany are established. Ansaldo Energia said that the plant could start producing electricity by the end of the decade.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/01/recirculate-giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,EUROPE,FINLAND,GERMANY,IRELAND,NORWAY,SPAIN,SWEDEN,SWITZERLAND,TURKEY",,"AUGUST 1, 2023",Recirculate – giving EV batteries a second-life,"EV sales passed 10 million last year and the International Energy Agency predicts 40 million in 2030. Growth is underpinned by battery manufacturers striving to keep pace with demands for enhanced performance and range. Such growth is driving a pressing waste challenge.
After 10 years to 15 years, EV batteries retain 70% to 80% of their original capacity, rendering them unsuitable for further automotive use, according to Dutch EV equipment supplier EVBox. The International Council on Clean Transportation estimates, by 2040, some 14 million EV battery packs will reach end-of-life annually. There is an urgent need for safe, responsible end-of-life battery management.
Research has focused on recycling batteries, to recover valuable materials including cobalt and lithium, with 35 EU recycling projects active or due by 2025. Less attention has been paid to preserving the inherent value of batteries. The concept of giving devices a second, or even third life, is gaining traction as it maximizes utilization of materials and energy and postpones recycling for years, or even decades.
Recirculate is a project funded by the EU’s Horizon Europe research program and Swiss federal body the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation. The initiative is pioneering a “4R” approach for batteries, encouraging repair, reuse, and remanufacture, before recycling. It will revolutionize the battery sector by developing the technologies and systems to enable cascading reuse of batteries in second-life applications such as battery energy storage systems. Led by Finland’s Centria University of Applied Sciences, Recirculate brings together research and industrial partners from eight countries, including the Ford Otomotive Sanayi carmaker owned by Ford and Turkish conglomerate Koç Holding, and DHL.
The first major hurdle to giving batteries a second-life is understanding their type and condition. EV battery packs comprise thousands of cells organized into modules and do not feature standard labelling. For optimal performance, second-life batteries must use cells with matching electrode chemistry and condition, creating a need for data on battery cell type and parameters such as state of charge, remaining useful life, state of health, and state of safety – collectively known as “state of x” (SoX). Battery management systems hold some of this data at pack level but original equipment manufacturers do not typically provide this information. Obtaining cell-level SoX data requires time-consuming, costly, unreliable analytical methods. Recirculate is developing diagnostic tools and processes to accelerate characterization of battery SoX at pack, module, cell, and other levels.
A lack of safe, rapid, scalable battery pack dismantling – to enable module and cell reuse – is another barrier. There are hundreds of battery designs with variations in size, electrode chemistry, and form factors. The need to plan for every possible pack, module, and cell permutation makes robotic disassembly impractical. Robotic systems also struggle with damaged or non-conforming batteries. Manual dismantling is the norm but is slow, expensive, and dangerous; fully discharging a battery causes irreversible damage, preventing further use, so operators work on live batteries, exposing them to potential electrical, fire, and chemical hazards. Recirculate aims to revolutionize battery dismantling with artificial intelligence-based control systems to adapt to different battery designs and conditions, providing a faster, safer, and more cost-effective alternative to manual disassembly.
The storage and transportation of used batteries also poses challenges, due to the risk of thermal runaway and fire. Europe classes EV batteries as dangerous goods, in part due to their susceptibility to thermal runaway when subjected to impact or damage. Complying with regulations on storage and transport creates a safety and cost barrier to transporting used batteries across the EU, impeding second-life adoption. Recirculate is developing a cost-effective, intelligent, safe transport and storage system for battery packs, modules, and cells. Integrating temperature sensors and fire suppression into battery travel cases, the system will enable early detection of thermal runaway risk and the development of effective fire mitigation and prevention strategies.
Although the technical challenges above are significant, the biggest barrier to the adoption of used batteries is the fragmented state of the second-life battery supply chain. Manufacturers must build and maintain business-to-business supplier relationships, which restricts supply of used products and impedes the sourcing of battery modules and cells of the same SoX for reuse.
Ideally, second-life battery manufacturers should be able to source used-battery components on the open market. However, a lack of transparent and trustworthy data on the type and condition of devices inhibits trade, increasing costs for battery remanufacturers as they must rigorously assess and characterize all modules and cells before deciding how to use them.
Recirculate will address this issue by developing, blockchain-backed product passports, holding a tamper-proof record of information on batteries and their components. This will provide supply chain actors with the trusted information they need to make informed decisions on how best to source and process used batteries. The program will establish a third-party marketplace underpinned by blockchain product passports, empowering consumers and commercial actors to source batteries of a specific type and condition with confidence.
The EU-Swiss initiative envisions an independent marketplace to create new business opportunities throughout the battery value chain. By expanding the supply of second-life batteries and their components and supplying a platform for services related to battery characterization, storage, transport, dismantling, remanufacturing, and trading, Recirculate aims to reshape the industry according to the needs of industry, consumers, and the market.
Recirculate consortium members will engage across the battery value chain to understand the challenges they face. This collaboration will ensure the project's competitive solutions align with the requirements of all interested parties, positioning European industry at the centre of a more sustainable battery value chain.

The government said the storage project will be the country's first pumped hydropower station, with its capacity ranging between 500 MW and 1,000 MW. It will use water from Lake Tarniţa and Lake Lăpusteşti. The system will feature turbines with capacities of 250 MW each.
Development originally began in 1989, but the project has since gone through a series of setbacks. Hidro Tarnita, the Romanian project company in charge of managing the planned asset, has held a number of failed tenders for the project over the past decade. Finally, the Romanian authorities abandoned the project in 2019 after defining it as financially unviable.

According to the report, approximately 15% of the surveyed companies plan to use AC coupling for their projects over the next three years. Additionally, other companies are considering hybrid AC coupled approaches, conventional AC coupled methods, behind-the-meter storage applications, or none of the mentioned approaches.
The report acknowledges that AC coupling is the most popular set-up due to its simplicity, but interest in the potential benefits of DC coupling is growing. However, there are still engineering and contractual challenges that need to be addressed.
Around 64% of the respondents aim to introduce or expand storage in their portfolios to mitigate the risk of cannibalization, but the complexity of monetizing co-located assets can slow down deployment.
The United Kingdom leads in solar and storage co-location in Europe, supported by mature grid services and energy storage markets, along with increased contractual provision for hybrid PPAs.
In Germany, the government has subsidized more than 1 GW of solar plus storage projects through tenders, driven by market dynamics such as increased volatility in wholesale markets.
The Nordic countries strive to lead in wind plus storage to counter cannibalization risks, while in Spain, cannibalization poses a threat to the solar sector.
The report notes the role of hybrid power purchase agreements (PPAs) in providing revenue from grid services while enhancing the value of renewable asset power production. It identifies three types of hybrid PPAs and their respective advantages, disadvantages, and price-influencing factors.
Pexapark describes three possible models for PPAs, depending on investment objectives, risk propensity, and marketing capabilities of asset owners. One model involves two contracts: a renewable PPA for the generation asset and a separate contract for the storage asset, functioning independently. Another model considers a variable price based on delivery time, and the third option involves shared contractual agreements between the two assets.
“Co-locating renewables and storage can create new value streams and opportunities for hybrid projects, but it also adds complexity and uncertainty to the revenue modeling,” said Xuejiao (Jo) Han, lead storage quant at Pexapark. “Our report aims to help developers, IPPs, and funds overcome this challenge and explore this emerging and exciting market segment.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/01/new-methodology-to-avoid-mispricing-the-value-of-pv-projects/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ARGENTINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 1, 2023",New methodology to avoid mispricing the value of PV projects,"Researchers at Argentina's National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET) have developed a comprehensive pricing framework for photovoltaic assets that reportedly shows how different real options embedded in a PV project interact with each other and how they affect the optimal timing and value of investment strategies.
“Our new methodology allows accommodating different sources of uncertainties with different stochastic features as well as accounting for the various managerial flexibilities embedded in most solar projects,” the research's corresponding author, Bruno Mombello, told pv magazine. “As uncertainty resolves and decisions proceed, often new options open to managers such as expanding capacity, relocating facilities, or disinvesting. Successive decisions can be assimilated into a portfolio of sequential, mutually coupled options. Our work advances on the current practice of valuing standalone options, as flexibilities are jointly priced as a compound multi-stage option portfolio which is optimally exercised.”
In the paper “Valuing photovoltaic power plants by compound real options,” published in Renewable Energy, Mombello and his colleagues explained that investments in photovoltaic assets should be made by pricing the projects as interacting multi-stage compound options, and not as standalone options.
“Renewable energy projects are being subjected to increasing uncertainties,” Mombello said. “Power price fluctuations, policy changes, subsidies withdrawals, emerging transmission congestions, and development of PV costs may have a deep impact on the economic profitability of renewable investments. The high energy and solar price volatilities experienced in recent years due to pandemics, war, and geopolitical conflicts are fresh and tangible examples of the substantial risks that renewable projects are facing.”
A compound option is usually defined as an option to receive another option as the underlying security. Simply speaking, it is an option on an option. The scientists said that the combinations of classical options, such as deferring, expanding, and relocating the plant, are jointly priced as sequential compound and mutually exclusive options. “Both relocation and mutually exclusive options have been previously overlooked when pricing PV projects,” they specified.
The proposed methodology is based on the least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) simulation approach, which is used to assess unpredictable outcomes influenced by random variables, by reducing complex processes to a set of basic events and interactions.
The LSM algorithm used by the research team combines dynamic programming, stochastic simulation, and linear regression to estimate the continuation value, which is the present value of all cash flows that will occur before the terminal year of an asset's expected lifetime. “The continuation function cannot be estimated by excluding out-of-the-money paths in compound options pricing,” the group specified.
The academics evaluated different option portfolios and found that the value of a PV project increases with the number of options included in the PV investment portfolio. “Option portfolios with the same options but different exercising order have different values,” they stated. “An option written on another one that modifies the underlying asset affects both backward and forward options. This changes their optimal exercise time.”
The researchers explained that, currently, PV project developers and investors price only the deferral option, which they said may lead to a significant undervaluation of solar investments. “The consideration of compound options and their implications can enhance the understanding of the actual worth of flexibility to manage uncertainty,” they concluded.
In 2019, the same research group developed a methodology for assessing the value of PV in uncertain markets. The researchers say their tool may bring to fruition projects exposed to risks related to competition, fuel and electricity price volatility, technological advances, environmental issues, and unstable regulatory regimes, among other problems.

PV system owners in northern Italy have become aware of the need to consider natural disasters due to significant damages related to heavy hailstorms in late July. Damages to solar panels are primarily caused by hailstones measuring at least 3 cm in size.
Massimo Albino Russo, the head of sales and business development for Italian O&M contractor Enerqos, told pv magazine Italy that Enerqos' smart O&M solutions combine traditional O&M with artificial intelligence and digitization. The company collects real-time operating data and production statistics from PV systems, enabling prompt intervention in case of natural disasters.
Enerqos uses strategically positioned sensors to understand real-time conditions and assess the need for intervention, while coordinating maintenance actions to optimize system performance. The company's monitoring software platform and AI enable quick assessments of PV system anomalies.
“Through a monitoring software platform and artificial intelligence we are able to immediately have all the data coming from the photovoltaic system, evaluate what is happening at the precise moment within the various components of the array in terms of energy and current,” said Russo.
This smart O&M procedure allows Enerqos to promptly activate task forces with field technicians to detect and repair damages. For hailstorms that break the glass surface perpendicularly, leaving panels still operational, it is essential to provide complete insurance coverage and plan precise and punctual technician interventions.
To efficiently detect damage to photovoltaic panels and all system components, Enerqos employs thermal drones for inspections, avoiding the need to check each panel individually. These drones quickly discern the type of damage, and whether it disrupts production or causes accidental damage to other components like inverters and cable trays.
Russo noted the importance of timely intervention through extraordinary maintenance services to produce comprehensive and detailed reports of system damages, preventing the suspension of production. For plants under construction that suffer damage, there are insurance policies to protect installers during construction.
Once operational, it is essential for system owners to sign insurance policies against force majeure, either directly or through Enerqos. The comprehensive smart O&M solution from Enerqos ensures that customers are protected from the economic damage of natural disasters.

Brisbane-headquartered UV Solar has installed a 9.135 kW solar power system atop a local church in the outer suburbs of the Australian city. The installation features Goodwe’s new lightweight Galaxy 315 W solar panels, accompanied by the Chinese manufacturer’s 10 kW SDT inverters and an electric vehicle charger.
The owners of Rock’s Church had been seeking to install a rooftop solar system at the facility to counter rising electricity bills but an assessment determined the building’s ageing roof, which had undergone repairs due to leakage issues, was not suitable to host a traditional rooftop system.
UV Solar opted instead to use GoodWe’s frameless Galaxy 315 W solar panel. The panel can be adhered to the roof surface without the need for drilling, making it suitable for installing on roofs with a low load-bearing capacity and poor waterproofing.
“We’ve been working closely with GoodWe for over four years now, and we’ve built a solid trust in the quality of their products and sales service,” a UV Power spokesman said. “Even though it is our first experience with their Galaxy Series, we found the product incredibly easy to install. We secured them to the roof within just five minutes.”
Apollo Chai, head of BIPV marketing at GoodWe Australia, said the inclusion of the Galaxy series in the manufacturer’s product portfolio makes it a more comprehensive energy solution provider.
“Over 25% of rooftops in Australia cannot be installed with traditional solar panels and mounting systems, due to the risk of weather damage and structural integrity being compromised,” he said. “The Galaxy series of panels is the ideal solution for these scenarios, especially for commercial property owners who are looking for solar solutions to reduce operational costs at a time when energy prices are increasing.”
The panels measure 2,116 mm × 777 mm × 4 mm and are reinforced by 1.6 mm ultra-thin glass which provides durability and all-weather protection. The new Galaxy 315 W panel has a power conversion efficiency of 174 W per square meter. The panels have a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius, the operating ambient temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The series also includes a 335 W model.
GoodWe offers a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee. It said the panels are able to operate at 82% of their original performance after 25 years and at 80% after 30 years.

The company said that the 145 GW of its pipeline with secured interconnection positions is likely unparalleled in the United States. It also noted that wherever it is feasible, it is taking control of these interconnection issues through its subsidiary, NextEra Transmission. The company disclosed a $400 million transmission development opportunity in the California Independent System Operator region.
As of the end of 2022, the total US interconnection queue was approximately 1,700 GW.
NextEra noted that the pricing and supply chain challenges from 2022 have largely subsided, allowing projects that were held up in 2022 to be brought online in 2023.

Solar modules are put through a variety of accelerated stress tests to evaluate these parameters. Through comparative test results, project stakeholders can select products best suited for a particular environment, location, or portfolio.
Quality
Hail durability
Top performers: JA Solar, JinkoSolar, Trina Solar
RETC’s hail durability test takes UL and IEC standards testing a step further, exposing solar modules to higher kinetic impact to reflect the risk posed by hail over a 25 or 30-year operating life. In addition to ballistic impact testing, RETC runs thermal cycle and hot-spot tests to reveal potential long-term module degradation.
The top eight performers in this category withstood an effective kinetic energy of 20 Joules or more. These modules effectively demonstrated resistance to a 45 mm (1.8 in.) iceball traveling at a terminal velocity of 30.7 m/s (68.7 mph).
Thresher Test
Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar Longi Solar, Runergy
The thresher test is a summation of a series of tests that places modules under a variety of vigorous environmental stresses to provide quantitative data behind degradation modes. Power drop, leakage current and visual observations are also made in the test.
The RETC test places backsheets, modules, and connectors through accelerated stresses. Thresher tests include humidity-freeze cycling, thermal cycling, damp heat exposure, static and dynamic load testing, and UV soaking. High performers in this category consistently achieved less than 2% of power degradation.
Performance
LeTID resistance
Top performers: Aptos Solar, Astronergy, JA Solar, Runergy, SEG Solar, Silfab Solar, Solar Space, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar
Relatively new cell technologies may experience long-term degradation associated with light exposure and elevated temperatures. This phenomenon, called light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID), is tested with a protocol of light soaking, followed by 75 C (167 F) temperature exposure for two 162-hour cycles to identify significant degradation (>5%). Subsequently, test samples are subject to 500 hours of 75 C temperature exposure followed by two additional 162-hour cycles.
Highlighted top performers demonstrated products that had less than 0.75% power loss after 486 hours of exposure.
LID resistance
Top performers: Dehui Solar, Longi Solar, Merlin Solar
Light-induced degradation (LID), or power losses from sunlight exposure, affects some PV cell types but not others. PV modules exposed to LID losses rapidly lose performance over the first few hours or days of operation before stabilizing.
RETC notes LID resistance is highly correlated with cell type. Top performers were all monocrystalline silicon panels and experienced an increase in performance or a modest decrease amounting to less than one tenth of one percent.
Module efficiency
Top performers: Auxin Solar, JA Solar, Longi Solar, Meyer Burger, Mission Solar, Qcells, REC Solar, Silfab Solar, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar
Module efficiency, or the percentage of incident solar energy converted to electrical energy, is a well-known and key metric for solar performance. It is highly correlated with cell technology and module design.
The top 14 highest scoring modules scored efficiencies of 20% or more. An n-type TOPCon cell scored the highest at 25.8% efficiency, followed by a monocrystalline silicon module with heterojunction technology, recording a 22.4% efficiency.
PAN file
Top performers: Dehui Solar, JA Solar, Longi Solar, Qcells, Runergy, Yingli Solar
The PAN file test is a module characterization test with 22 parameters set by the PVsyst modeling software. Project developers use PVsyst to evaluate potential sites based on energy production and financial performance.
The assuming filed test conditions of a 10 MW utility-scale solar plant in Midland, Texas with fixed tilt ground mounts and 500 kVA central inverters. Top performers in the PAN test achieved a performance ratio in PVsyst of 85% or greater.
In the latest, “In Conversation” issue of pv magazine we talk to a range of people about their experience with solar, from a sailor and a pair of overland adventurers to a mountain climber and more besides. We also focus on Africa to consider why a continent with such vast solar resource still lags more developed economies when it comes to widespread PV and energy storage rollout.
Reliability
Damp heat test
Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar, Longi Solar, Qcells, Runergy, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar
The RETC thresher test includes a damp heat test that exposes modules for 2,000 hours, double the amount required for product certification. The test evaluates a module’s ability to withstand prolonged exposure to humid, high-temperature environments. Taking place inside an environmental chamber, the test exposes modules to a controlled temperature of 85 C (185 F) and a relative humidity of 85% for a set amount of time.
RETC highlighted performers that experienced less than 2% degradation after this exposure.
PID resistance
Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar, JinkoSolar, Qcells, Runergy
Potential induced degradation (PID) resistance tests rack-mounted modules in an environmental chamber, which controls temperature and humidity, and exposes them to a voltage bias of several hundred volts with respect to the mounting structure. Typically, exposure times range from 96 hours to as much as 500 hours. PID testing characterizes a module’s ability to withstand degradation due to voltage and current leakage resulting from ion mobility between the semiconductor and other elements in module packaging.
Nearly 28% of the test samples experienced less than 1% degradation over the test period. By comparison, less than 9% of modules achieved greater than 5% power loss.
Static and dynamic mechanical load test
Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar, JinkoSolar, Longi Solar, Runergy, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar
This test exposes modules to 1,000 cycles of +1,000 pascal and –1,000 pascal loads at a frequency of three to seven cycles per minute. Measurements were taken after this stress test rate electrical performance.
This year, nearly 47% of the modules that RETC subjected to simulated wind and environmental stresses achieved less than 2% degradation in power. Roughly 17% of the total test samples experienced less than 1% degradation in power after the SDML sequence. RETC notes that the results in this category represent a modest improvement on a year-over-year basis.
Thermal cycling
Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar, JinkoSolar, Longi Solar, Qcells, Runergy, Saint Gobain, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar
The thermal cycle test calls for cycling modules in an environmental chamber between two temperature extremes—85 C (185 F) on the high end and –40 C (–40F)  on the low end. The RETC test runs 600 cycles, three times as much as the 200 required for certification.
Roughly 80% of modules in this test achieved less than 2% power loss, while only 2.4% had power losses of 4% or more.
Overall top performers
“To identify the best of the best, we reviewed and ranked the overall data distributions across all three disciplines: quality, performance, and reliability. The Overall Results Matrix on the right summarizes the results of this analysis, which highlights eight high achievers based on overall highest achievement in manufacturing,” said RETC.
