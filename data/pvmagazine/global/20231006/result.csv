https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/06/a-reaction-to-rystads-recent-estimates-on-european-solar-module-stockpile/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,EUROPE",,"OCTOBER 6, 2023",A reaction to Rystad’s recent estimates on European solar module stockpile,"From pv magazine Germany
A week ago, Rystad Energy corrected its previous statements about the inventory of Chinese module imports downwards by 60% and assumed 40 GW inventories in the EU at the end of 2023.
Quote: “The market has reacted and companies have significantly reduced their orders,” said a Rystad analyst in an article published by pv magazine on September 29. Relying on export data for modules from China to Europe, he said that inventory levels are stagnating at around 40 GW. Manufacturers would not flood the European market without wholesalers and project developers placing corresponding orders, he also said.
This week, however, Rystad told pv magazine that there are suddenly 80 GW in the EU warehouses, and Rystad assumes that there could be 100 GW by the end of 2023.
Rystad said that the new numbers are based on new figures that have only been available this week, with the assumed decline having not occurred after all.
Bang! From 40 GW to 80 GW within six weeks because of supposedly new numbers.
And what happens next is no longer understandable to me.
From January 2023 to the end of August 2023, around 78 GW were exported from China to the EU. That's right – the official export figures from China are confirming this and it is no secret. The 78 GW probably also includes at least 5 GW to 6 GW of OEM modules that are sold under labels from “EU manufacturers” but come entirely from China.
Anyone can easily check this here for the last few years (csv file, scroll to EU):
https://ember-climate.org/data-catalogue/china-solar-pv-exports/
As I have already described several times, at the end of 2022, with an EU market of 46 GW, we had a “normal” inventory of two to three months, essentially around 8 GW, plus around 33 GW.
How to calculate “module surplus” with a simple Excel table
This is how the year 2023 began, and from here on, it is a simple Excel table with which you can calculate the “module surplus.”
In this table, you will note the official export from China to the EU with a delay of around two months, the EU market development up to the point in time under consideration, and the “normal storage cycle” of two to three months until the modules then appear in the installation statistics.
Based on my long solar experience, these are normal numbers on the way from the port to the customer and the completed installation or its official registration.
With an EU market of 60 GW to 114 GW expected for 2023, 10 GW to 19 GW would be the expected new normal for module inventories.
It's just a different dimension than before, and you have to get used to 10 GW to 19 GW as a “normal” warehouse flow – until recently, the entire EU market was that big per year. But now, it is 20 times larger than it was in the darkest days of the anti-dumping duties.
I'm surprised at how the analysts at Rystad Energy are proceeding. It has been easy all year long to take the Chinese export data, add “normal” warehouse flow, and then follow the EU installations closely. There was “no new data overnight,” only the export data from August of 8 GW, after 7.2 GW in July, and 11.6 GW in May. This doesn't look like a surprise to me.
In Germany, PV capacity is growing considerably, as reported every month by the Federal Network Agency. And in Germany alone, the market is growing by an incredible 85% compared to 2022, and I hear similar things from many other countries. Therefore, EU growth from 46 GW in 2022 to well over 80 GW in 2023 is entirely possible.
I don't know exactly where we stand with EU installations at the end of September. But it's very easy with Excel to enter 60 GW, 80 GW, and 114 GW as an EU market for the entire year 2023, scale it to the period up to the end of October using the rule of three, and calculate the export data plus warehousing against it.
The results for the EU warehouses can be estimated based on the end of October. By then, all of the exporters from August will have arrived here, meaning 78 GW since January. These are the results:
With a 60 GW market in the EU in 2023:
“Normal” inventory: 10 GW
Module consumption in 2023, up to and including October: 50 GW
“Excess” inventory, including excess from 2022: 59 GW
With an 80 GW market in the EU in 2023:
“Normal” inventory: 13 GW
Module consumption in 2023, up to and including October: 67 GW
“Excess” inventory, including excess from 2022: 39 GW
With a 114 gigawatt peak market in the EU in 2023:
“Normal” inventory: 19 GW
Module consumption in 2023, up to and including October: 95 GW
“Excess” inventory, including excess from 2022: 5 GW
I expect at least something quite simple like this from a large analyst firm like Rystad.
One could also say: “It's the real size of the EU installation market.”
Because that's what it's all about in the end: Have manufacturers, retailers, and others overestimated the EU market? Are there a lot of goods there? Or do they not have that, and in some cases, there is very little product?
In any case, it has nothing to do with “dumping” and you have to have strong special interests in order to derive accusations of dumping from the stocks. These would then apply in the same way to OEM modules imported from China, as well as to solar cells from China.
In the end, all the magnificent growth of the EU solar market is “brutally” good news for climate protection in the EU and the entire world.

German startup 1Komma5° has unveiled plans to build a solar module manufacturing facility in eastern Germany.
The Hamburg-based company said the new factory will be located in the states of Brandenburg or Saxony. It will start commercial operations next year. The facility will produce TOPCon panels and will initially have an annual production capacity of 1 GW. The company plans to expand the capacity to 5 GW by 2030.
This year, the startup launched new 415 W full black TOPCon modules. The company uses polysilicon from Wacker Chemie for its solar modules, which are currently manufactured in China according to its own specifications. Wacker Chemie's polysilicon will also be used in production in Germany.
1Komma5° initially refrained from disclosing the source of the solar cells for its solar modules and the exact investment amount allocated for its production facility setup. Its response to pv magazine‘s inquiry is still pending. However, the company has recently expanded its supply chains to encompass the markets of Germany, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Spain, Italy, and Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/06/becquerel-institutes-data-hub-aims-to-plug-solar-pv-information-gap/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",ANGELA SKUJINS,"OCTOBER 6, 2023",Becquerel Institute’s Data Hub aims to plug solar PV ‘information gap’,"Brussels-based consultancy firm, the Becquerel Institute, launched its new online platform titled the European Solar PV Data Hub last week at the European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference in Lisbon. The Data Hub includes quarterly and yearly market data updates for all European countries, with forecasts and component pricing reports available to buy.
The company’s COO Philippe Macé told pv magazine today that while the platform aims to provide users a way to access solar PV market data “easily”, its other purpose is to shrink the industry’s “information gap”.
“In the industry, we get people outside of the world of PV asking us, ‘What's the size of the market in this country?’ ‘How does it compare with the total European markets?' And ‘Why can I not find this data?',” he said. “We would like to reduce that information gap.”
A team of Becquerel Institute analysts “clean” and “normalize” supplied information – such as solar PV installed capacity – provided by each country’s peak solar association or regulator and the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEAPPSP), with the Data Hub acting as an aggregator. The information is easier to collect from larger markets as bigger countries are “well organized,” Macé said. “Germany, for instance, is quite easy to collect data,” he explained, “but in France, for example, you have different sources, and they are often contradictory.”
“We aggregate the data but we cross-check between sources, and most importantly, we make a choice on what's the most reliable and probable number we should display,” he said. Examples of European countries where it is difficult to provide reliable market data include Estonia and Slovenia. But the Becquerel Institute has a way around it. “For these ones, it is much harder to get data, so we make estimates, we make informed guesses based on feedback from, if not actually local people, some people in the neighboring markets,” Macé said.
The information is then pumped into charts that display annual market share per segment, cumulative installed capacity per year and year-on-year market growth. While the information provided on these pages, such as “highlights” and “country status”, is free, other segments on the Data Hub are not.
For a fee, users can receive “country forecasts” up until 2027 – comprising figures per market segment and a comparative European map, among other features – and “custom-made reports” responding to a “client’s need”, the Data Hub website states. This would take the form of “components prices” and include additional aggregated data, such as global solar PV spot prices, and “pricing trend” analysis.
Asked why the press release and website state “our portal is currently free” when the whole portal is not currently free, Macé clarified: “I would say that half of it is free. The rest is not behind a paywall but restricted access.” The Becquerel Institute has “no” plans to charge users for any of the free information, Macé said, adding there was no “single price” scheme currently in use and the price is determined per customer.
The Data Hub’s target market is “basically everybody”, Macé said, with a focus on project developers, manufacturers and governments. The website is running as a minimum viable product until the end of the year. Macé said the Becquerel Institute welcomes feedback on the platform.

Heliup, a spinoff of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), has secured €10 million ($10.5 million) of funding from a group of investors led by Starquest Capital and including EIT InnoEnergy, BNP Paribas Développement, real estate group Idec, and BPIFrance.
The company said it plans to use the funds to establish a production facility in France for lightweight solar panels, with an initial annual capacity of 100 MW. The facility is set to become operational in 2024.
The Stykon ultralight panels weigh just 5 kg/m2 and are designed for flat roofs on tertiary buildings that cannot support traditional framed panels.
“We have been looking for a technology that would allow us to gain a foothold in the photovoltaic sector for a long time. We found it with Heliup which meets a need that is very poorly covered by the market: an ultra-light panel with resistance and performance equivalent to a traditional panel,” said Emmanuel Gaudé, managing director of Starquest. “This is a real breakthrough in a market representing several hundred million m2 of roofs but currently unaddressed due to a lack of economically viable solutions.”
Heliup said it plans to expand its production capacity to 200 MW or 300 MW in the future, while exploring international projects beyond France.

The team also specifically looked at the impact of climate change on such hybrid projects.
“As climate change will impact renewable energy resources, it is important to take its effects into account for complementarity assessments,” researchers noted. “However, there are only a few works that study the influence of climate change on offshore renewable resource complementarity.”
According to the assessment, complementarity increases over longer periods of time, compared with shorter timescales. Additionally, the assessment determined that the complementarity of offshore solar-wind farms is expected to increase over time under substantial global warming.
For their research, the scientists studied the complementarity metric Kendall's τ on different timescales, with τ being calculated on the time-dependent profiles for wind power density (WPD) and PV power. All the data used in the study were validated in literature, through the team’s own calculations, or both.
Information on wind speeds, air pressures, and temperatures from 2008 through 2018 came from the Dutch Offshore Wind Atlas (DOWA), while data on global horizontal irradiance (GHI), direct normal irradiance (DNI), diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI), and surface temperature values for the period January 2011 through December 2022 came from Solcast.
“At 10-minute, hourly and 3-hourly timescales, only a small degree of complementarity is present. The complementarity on daily, weekly and monthly timescales is more significant and increases with the length of the timescale,” the report stated. It adds that the behavior of solar and wind resources in the Belgian North Sea makes it a desirable location for hybrid offshore solar-wind projects, as “strong periods of solar power nicely alternate with strong periods of wind power.”
The research team used regional climate simulations for the period 2030-2100 – in particular, climate representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 – in order to assess the effect of climate change on the behavior of the resources. This meant increasing the “radiative forcing compared to pre-industrial times by 4.5 and 8.5 W/m2, respectively.” For RCP4.5, the team did not observe a clearly increasing or decreasing trend in complementarity, while for RCP8.5, the team noted a slight increase in complementarity anticipated closer to 2100.
According to the analysis, hybridizing offshore wind systems by adding solar capabilities could take advantage of opportunities for common grid connections in order to increase yield while also not taking up a significant amount of space, losing a significant amount of electricity to curtailment, or hindering maintenance of the wind farm.
“We estimated that a 3020 MWp FPV system, added to the 2262 MW wind power in the Belgian North Sea, would increase the renewable electricity yield by 47% while only losing 16% of the PV electricity to curtailment in the studied period of 2021–2022 for the assumed connections,” the researchers found.
The team’s complete analysis can be found in the study “The complementarity of offshore wind and floating photovoltaics in the Belgian North Sea, an analysis up to 2100,” which was published in Renewable Energy. The research was supported by the Belgian Energy Transition fund, which provided funds for the study.

GSE has published an interactive map of the primary substations in Italy. The tool allows users to geolocalize connection points for energy communities, as required by Italian legislation on self-consumption.
Self-consumption collectives consist of consumers within the same building or complex, while energy communities encompass a broader range, including businesses and public organizations near power sources.
The GSE is required to update the interactive map every two years. It currently lists approximately 2,000 primary cabins across the country.
In Italy, energy communities receive special tariffs for shared renewable energy systems up to 200 kW, and surplus power can be injected into the grid without compensation, possibly encouraging storage adoption.
Self-consumed electricity avoids bill charges but lacks direct incentives, relying on indirect incentives through avoided electricity costs ranging from €0.13 ($0.14)/kWh to €0.20/kWh.
Italy introduced new provisions for solar energy communities in March 2020.

The “PVcase Roof Mount” plugin offers 3D building preparation, layout generation, shading calculation, electrical design, and exporting to PVsyst for analysis. The company said that 3D building preparation allows users to quickly prepare a building with its obstacles and offset zones on the roof for module placement-
“Layout generation provides the required settings information and automatically places modules on a flat or sloped roof,” it said. “Shading calculation helps to determine which modules are overshaded and should be removed and which ones should be left in the layout.”
The company said the plugin provides electrical design capabilities with automated string placement algorithms for precision, but it also offers guidance for manual stringing to match inverter sizing and layout efficiency. It also includes a cabling feature for semi-automated cable path routing and length calculations. PVcase, which raised $100 million in an investment round last July led by Highland Europe, Energize, and Elephant, and recently acquired Anderson Optimization, is now offering its design software for solar projects in Europe.

The new approach eliminates the need for removing and reinstalling the tested PV modules from their operating positions, which the scientists describe as a “cumbersome and expensive task and represents a risk for the physical integrity of the modules.”
The procedure entails using a reference module and taking into consideration the temperature differences between the reference and the tested module. It involves two radio-linked I-V tracers to simultaneously measure I-V curves and temperature measurements at the centers of both the reference and the tested modules.
The scientists conducted seven testing campaigns at commercial PV plants. Measurements were carried out on over 7000 I-V curves on 600 PV modules. The resulting estimated uncertainties are slightly higher than those corresponding to high-quality solar simulators, but still low enough to meet strict quality control requirements, according to the researchers.
“We are able to apply very low-uncertainty measurements of PV modules in the field, which paves the way for accomplishing degradation measurements directly by the O&M teams of PV plants and on a regular basis,” Rodrigo Moretón, CEO of Spanish photovoltaic engineering and consultancy firm Qualifying Photovoltaics (QPV), told pv magazine.
The results from these testing campaigns suggested that four testing rounds, delayed at least 2 hours, resulted in average expanded uncertainties in STC power of about 1.3% for the average power of a sample of modules, according to the researchers.  The uncertainty in single module values was twice as large but still sufficient to detect anomalous defective or underrated modules.
“The results have been validated against those obtained by an accredited lab with a mobile flash, obtaining similar standard deviation values (<1%), which entails a further confirmation of the procedure validity,” said the research team.
The researchers also claimed the instrumentation allowed over 500 measurements to be taken per day, provided the modules were previously cleaned and disconnected from the PV array so that terminals could be easily accessed. “This represents more than twice the numbers currently achieved with mobile solar simulators,” stated the researchers.
The research team comprised scientists from QPV, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) and Spanish renewable energy company Acciona Energia. Its findings are available in the paper “On outdoor testing procedures of large samples of PV modules,” published in Progress in Photovoltaics.

This year’s projects irrigated a total of 830 ha of agricultural land, costing PHP1,643,583,002 ($29 million). There were 17 solar-powered irrigation projects completed by September 15, with the agency estimating they will spend Php 1,720,984,000 on next year’s projects irrigating 2,168 ha of agricultural land.
Among the completed projects, were two PV arrays deployed on top of irrigation canals. Solar projects on canals are proliferating across the world. Recent projects were announced in Spain, India, France, United States, and Pakistan, among others, but only a few of them have been realized to date. These projects provide electricity without occupying land and reducing water evaporation.
The two projects are the 350 ha Buspan Solar Pump Irrigation System in Malamig, Central Luzon, and the Anbuspa Solar Pump Irrigation System located in Tibagan, Central Luzon. The latter project was replicated from the NIA Region III project, located in Bulacan, which installed 155 solar panels with 60 KW capacity on the top of an irrigation canal.
The agency said they were pursuing solar-powered irrigation projects to replace “expensive diesel pumps” with the end-use of solar energy deemed the “most accessible and economically viable” of all renewable energy sources.
“With the soaring price of gasoline and diesel, these projects can continue to irrigate their lands free from the burden of shouldering high fuel costs,” the agency said in the announcement. “The technology consists of solar panels, pumps, electronic pump controllers, storage tanks, and conveyor systems. With solar power, it is seen to be more cost-effective than the fuel-powered irrigation pumps due to operation costs.”
The Philippines aims to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030, with a possible focus on mini-grids and standalone clean power systems due to the country's archipelagic nature, according to a 2022 report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/06/solar-cell-prices-are-expected-to-hit-fresh-record-lows-following-chinas-golden-week/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 6, 2023",Solar cell prices are expected to hit fresh record lows following China’s Golden Week,"Solar cell prices stopped declining this week – arresting three straight weeks of prior decline – due to limited activities during China's Golden Week holiday. According to OPIS data, prices have momentarily stabilized at their lowest levels ever this week – Mono M10 and G12 cell prices stayed unchanged at $0.0814 per W and $0.0836/W, respectively; TOPcon M10 cell price this week likewise remained at $0.0856/W.
The majority of industry sources concurred that following the holiday, new record lows for cell prices can be expected. A seller source predicts that the price of P-type M10 cells will decline to around CNY 0.61 ($0.085)/W after the holiday, while the price of TOPCon M10 cells will continue to carry a CNY0.05 ($0.0069)/W premium over p-type M10 cells.

 
The pricing differential between p-type and n-type M10 cells is confirmed by a second seller source, who predicts that after the holiday, p-type M10 cells may drop to around CNY0.63 ($0.088)/W while TOPCon M10 cells would drop to CNY0.68 ($0.094)/W
According to a market observer, cell producers are currently maintaining a profit margin of about 10-15%. This source therefore expected that there is still room for cell prices to decrease after the holiday.
Insiders anticipate a fall in cell prices, mostly as a result of a decline in demand for cells from downstream module producers due to certain module makers curtailing production. Additionally, module prices are also in the bearish sentiments due to the severe oversupply, as a result, cell prices will inescapably be influenced by downstream pessimism.
A source from an integrated player, on the other hand, expressed skepticism over the prediction that cell prices will continue decreasing following the holiday. “After all, the price of cells has already decreased by about 14% over the last three weeks, which is a significant amount,” the source explained.
The price of polysilicon has a significant role in determining how much cell price will drop after the holiday, a source from a specialized cell manufacturer concluded. There isn’t much room for wafer and cell prices to decrease at present. More significant price cuts must wait until polysilicon's price drop frees up price reduction space for wafers and cells, the source added.

The company announced its initiative to source surplus solar power from residential, commercial, and industrial rooftop PV systems, as well as floating solar arrays, with the intention of reselling it to small and medium-sized businesses, as well as large apartment complexes throughout Japan.
It said it aims to provide a solution for companies facing challenges related to the upfront costs and technical complexities associated with installing PV systems on their rooftops.
While continuing to produce solar modules at its factory in Shiga prefecture, the Japanese manufacturer is actively engaged in the sale of PV systems. However, it closed its manufacturing facility in Tianjin, northern China, in March.
In its most recent financial report, published in July, Kyocera noted an improvement in sales within its smart energy business, which includes all PV-related activities.

“The study carried out could be useful for the authorities working in EV charging stations infrastructure development, policymakers and researchers,” the research group said. “The challenges associated with this work are mass adoption of EVs and consumer’s readiness to purchase the technology.”
They designed charging stations capable of charging 15 to 20 electric vehicles (EVs) with an operating frequency of 652 kWh/day and a daily power requirement of 20 kW. The EVs were also considered to be able to discharge electricity into the grid, essentially serving as mobile batteries.
The microgrid in question consists of a 4 kWh battery, a 15 kW PV system, and a 100 kW biogas generator. The researchers calculated the capital costs, replacement costs, operations and maintenance, and the lifetime of each component.
After considering all these factors, they compared this system to charging stations that rely solely on biogas or grid electricity.
The study found that the proposed PV-biogas-grid charging stations had an energy cost of $0.518/kWh, a life-cycle cost of $468,842, lifetime operating costs of $9,874, and a payback period of four years. In contrast, the biogas-grid reference system had an energy cost of $0.54/kWh, life-cycle cost of $492,512, operating costs of $14,527, and a payback period of five years.
Regarding CO2 emissions, the scientists compared the proposed system to systems relying solely on PV-grid or biogas-grid. The proposed system had CO2 emissions of 9,419 kg per year, while the PV-grid had 18,542 kilograms per year, and the biogas-grid had 12,450 kg per year. The proposed system reduced CO2 emissions by 49.2% compared to PV-grid charging stations and by 24.3% compared to biogas-grid-based charging stations.
The researchers suggested that future research could focus on integrating different energy storage systems, such as fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors, with EV charging technology. They also highlighted the need for developing wireless access support for EV charging techniques.
They introduced the system in “Assessment of microgrid integrated biogas–photovoltaic powered Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) for sustainable future,” which was recently published in Energy Reports. The study was conducted by scientists from India’s REVA University, SDM College of Engineering and Technology, RYM Engineering College and the National Institute of Technology, along with a scientist from South Africa’s University of Johannesburg. The results were first shown at the 8th International Conference on Sustainable and Renewable Energy Engineering.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/06/solar-records-tumble-across-central-europe-in-september/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",,"OCTOBER 6, 2023",Solar records tumble across Central Europe in September,"Germany and Central Europe saw their highest September irradiances in at least 17 years, due to an “Omega block” weather pattern. These levels reached 130-140% of historical September averages according to data collected by Solcast, a DNV company, via the Solcast API.
The record irradiances were caused by an ‘Omega’ blocking pattern that kept high pressure stuck over Central Europe, leading to consistently clear skies there, but pushed cloud and storms southward. This pattern is similar to other El Nino late summers in the region, but was more persistent, leading to the highest September Irradiance seen over Germany and Central Europe in Solcast’s 17 years of data. This pattern also led to concentrated precipitation further south, causing floods across Greece, Turkey and Spain. Cloud associated with that rain also decreased irradiance in those regions.

These patterns have driven significantly higher irradiance than normal for September from Germany to Russia. Somewhat making up for a cloudier than normal August, solar providers will have seen up to 130% of historical September averages. As can be seen in the below average daily GHI, Germany and Poland received roughly the same irradiance across the month as Spain and Portugal. This pattern is
particularly unusual, especially given the shorter days further north.

While such patterns align with previous El Nino years, the outcome this year stands out. Analysis using the Solcast Historical Time Series indicates a significant surge in September irradiance, surpassing any year in recent history. Major cities like Berlin, Munich, Prague, and Warsaw reported heightened September irradiance levels, with results closer to August averages than September. In contrast, the Iberian Peninsula and Greece saw diminished levels, with Lisbon and Athens capturing only around 80% of their typical September irradiance.

Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.
