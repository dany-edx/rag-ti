With the authority having pledged the tender a week ago – plus a separate procurement exercise dedicated to 1 GW of wind capacity – details of the proposed legislation were today published in the official gazette of the Canadian province.
The Quebecois government, announcing the plans last Wednesday, said the documents would be available for public consultation for 45 days after publication but the entry made in the gazette said the legislation would take effect in 15 days' time.
Wind developers will also be able to compete in the non-technology-specific 1.3 GW clean energy exercise, with the draft documents stating state-owned power company Hydro-Quebec must issue the two tenders this year.
Trade body the Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanRea) has welcomed the move, with Jean Habel, its director for Quebec and Atlantic Canada, stating: “The government of Quebec’s decision to develop 1,000 MW of wind energy and 1,300 MW from all renewable sources is good news for CanRea members. It will help achieve Quebec’s GHG [greenhouse gas] reduction targets and CanRea’s 2050 Vision, which stresses the scale and speed required for the deployment of renewable energy projects to meet Canada’s climate change targets.”
The move comes after the latest Canadian federal budget added an extra CAD 459 million ($360 million) to the CAD 4.4 billion Greener Homes Program, which provides grants and cheap finance for retrofitted improvements to low-income housing, including the installation of rooftop solar.
The Justin Trudeau government pledged CAD 1 billion, over six years from 2024-25, for the manufacture, processing and recycling of materials for electric vehicles (EVs) and battery storage plus an immediate “over CAD 900 million” for EV charging infrastructure.
The federal government has also promised an income tax credit of up to 30% for battery storage, clean hydrogen, and “other net-zero technology” systems.
Almost CAD 900 million will be devoted to upgrading inter-provincial electricity networks, with CAD 25 million to draw up regional net-zero energy plans; CAD 600 million for the renewables and grid modernization plans embodied in the Smart Renewables and Electrification Pathways Program; and CAD 250 million over four years for pre-development activity for clean power projects of “national significance.”

The device is described as a heat engine with no moving parts that is able to produce power from a heat source of between 1,900 to 2,400 C. This concept is known as thermal energy grid storage (TEGS) and consists of a low-cost, grid-scale energy storage technology that uses TPVs to convert heat to electricity above 2,000 C. “It is a battery that takes in electricity, converts it to high-temperature heat, stores the heat and then converts it back to electricity by TPVs on demand,” the US group explained.
The system was built with two-junction TPV devices comprising III–V materials with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 eV that were optimized for the planned temperature range and TEGS applications. These cells utilize band-edge spectral filtering to obtain high efficiency, using highly reflective back surface reflectors to reject unusable sub-bandgap radiation back to the emitter.
The scientists tested several system configurations and a thermophotovoltaic device with bandgaps between 1.2 and 1.4 eV was found to have the highest efficiency at 41.1% operating at a power density of 2.39 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,400 C. Another device with a 1.2/1.0 eV bandgap reached a maximum efficiency of 39.3%, at a power density of 1.8 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,127 C.
The thermophotovoltaic cell should now be integrated into a grid-scale thermal battery. “The system would absorb excess energy from renewable sources such as the sun and store that energy in heavily insulated banks of hot graphite,” the researchers emphasized. “When the energy is needed, such as on overcast days, TPV cells would convert the heat into electricity, and dispatch the energy to a power grid.”
The device was presented in the study “Thermophotovoltaic efficiency of 40%,” which was recently published in nature.  Their work demonstrated the main parts of the system in separate, small-scale experiments and the research group is currently working to integrate the parts to demonstrate a fully operational system. “Thermophotovoltaic cells were the last key step toward demonstrating that thermal batteries are a viable concept,” said MIT researcher Asegun Henry. “One of the advantages of solid-state energy converters are that they can operate at higher temperatures with lower maintenance costs because they have no moving parts.”

Spain's Emica Bombas S.A., a provider of centrifugal pumps, ventilation, and machinery, has unveiled a new design for floating PV system that reproduces the structure of a trimaran, a kind of boat built on a main hull with two smaller outrigger hulls attached with lateral beams.
The system is the first prototype from the company's new Emica Solar subsidiary.
According to the manufacturer, the proposed system architecture offers more stability compared to conventional floating structures and reduces by up to 93% the contact area of the system with the water.
The first system prototype was recently developed on a water reservoir in Alava, in the northeastern territory of the Basque Country. The company claims it allows the deployment of the modules with a tilt angle of up to 25 degrees, stating that conventional floating structures commonly allow tilt angles of up to 10 degrees. According to Emica Bombas, this enables developers to make the use of bifacial panels more convenient.

When water basins must be emptied to clean the bottoms, the floating structure allows this task to be tackled without the need to dismantle the installation. “The set is designed by naval engineers,” the company said, adding that it can withstand winds of 29 m/s and waves of 1 m in height.
The pilot floating array was built with 32 solar panels with an installed capacity of 11 kW.
“Emica Solar was created by combining, on the one hand, the solidity of the Emica brand, its commercial network and its financial capacity; and on the other, a patented floating product known as EMS,” the company stated.

This emerges from a list of projects under review published this week by Croatia's Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development.
The list includes 216 renewable energy projects with a combined capacity of 5.95 GW, most of which are for solar power plants. The largest is the 950 MW project in Šibenik-Knin while the smallest one has a capacity of just 500 kW.
If approved by the Croatian authorities, these projects could then be entitled to compete in public energy auctions or to sell power under bilateral purchase agreements.
Hrvatski Operator Tržišta Energije (HROTE), the Croatian electricity and gas regulator, launched a 2.2 GW auction scheme for renewables last year. In April, it launched an auction to allocate 322 MW of renewable energy capacity to developers. The Croatian government is also supporting rooftop PV through a rebate scheme.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Croatia had 309 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2021.

A press release issued by the analyst's company, Bernreuter Research, warned that development, together with the huge push in solar-grade polysilicon fab expansion being witnessed in China, will see the latter nation corner more than 90% of global supply by 2023.
“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has opened the eyes for what it means to be economically dependent on a dictatorial regime,” said Bernreuter. “Western governments should not make the same mistake with China. It is high time to establish non-Chinese solar supply chains. China has demonstrated what the ingredients of success are: low electricity rates for power-hungry polysilicon and ingot production, loan guarantees for private investment, cost-efficient equipment manufacturing, and strategic foresight.”
With Tongwei having supplanted Wacker as the world's biggest polysilicon producer in 2020, the German manufacturer has been shunted down into fourth place, based on last year's performance as recorded by Bernreuter Research.
GCL Technology has climbed to second on the list. Like Tongwei, it produced more than 100,000 tons of polysilicon last year. Both companies, according to Bernreuter Research, will have the capacity to make more than 370,000 tons per year by 2023.
Daqo New Energy remains in third place in the latest ranking, followed closely by Wacker in fourth; Xinte Energy; and number six Xinjiang East Hope New Energy, which produces polysilicon in Xinjiang.
Silicon production in Xinjiang is a controversial issue outside China – particularly the topic of whether forced labor is a part of the solar value chain. The US House of Representatives in December drafted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which proposes banning all imports from Xinjiang unless it can be proven forced labor played no part in their manufacture.
Bernreuter Research predicted the expansionary strategy of Chinese poly makers would see Wacker's market share contract further with the German business due to trail Xinte and East Hope by 2023, in sixth place.
That would mark a similar path to that taken by former world number one, the US-based Hemlock Semiconductor, which is owned by US tech company Corning. Since losing top-dog status in the poly ranking in 2012, Hemlock has steadily fallen down the list to sit ninth in the current edition.
South Korean poly maker OCI, which manufactures most of its product in Malaysia, sits seventh in the ranking and the only European presence in the top 10 is related to the 15% stake Norwegian company REC Silicon holds in the Shaanxi Non Ferrous Tianhong REC Silicon Materials joint venture in China, which is 85% held by a state-owned miner. REC's fully-owned silicon production facilities are based in the US.

“Br-FBs have been one of the most promising energy storage technologies with attracting advantages of low price, wide potential window, and long cycle life,” the scientists explained. “However, Br-FBs suffer from the sluggish kinetics of Br2/Br– redox couple and serious self-discharge, which hinder the further commercialization and industrialization of Br-FBs.”
They also pointed out the electrodes used in these devices as one of the critical components, as they provide the reaction sites for redox couples and may have a significant effect on the performance of Br-FBs. They also provided a comprehensive overview of different high-performance cathodes for high-power density and long-lifespan Br-FBs and these devices were compared with commonly used cathode materials. “At present, porous carbon fiber-based materials, especially carbon felts (CFs) and graphite felts (GFs), are the most commonly used cathodes in Br-FBs due to their low price, good electronic conductivity, outstanding corrosion resistance as well as controllable surface properties.”
Their work also identified modification methods aimed at improving the cathodes' performance, such as surface treatment, metallic element modification, nonmetallic element modification, and structure decoration. The modification methods, however, are still unable to cope with poor bromine retention ability and unclear mechanisms of Br2/Br– redox reactions.
Looking forward, the Chinese group identified the most important challenges to address in future research: “The further development directions are as follows: (i). To continually develop advanced electrodes of Br-FBs with high activity and bromine retention capacity by enhancing their chemical surfaces and improving their physical structures. (ii). The reaction mechanisms on the electrode are not clear and need in-depth investigations. (iii) To improve the bromine fixing/retention capacity of electrodes by structural design, namely, to inhibit the diffusion and migration of bromine species to the negative side.”
Their findings were presented in the paper “Progress and Perspective of the Cathode Materials towards Bromine-Based Flow Batteries,” which was recently published in Energy Material Advances.

The Salt River Project, a 10 MW energy storage project that uses lithium-ion batteries, was dealt a blow last week when a fire broke out. Firefighters were alerted to a fire at the facility last Monday. During a press conference on Thursday, a spokesperson for the Chandler Fire Department confirmed that there was a battery on fire in the building but that sprinkler systems had been able to control it.
Three years ago firefighters in Peoria, Arizona, learned the hazards of battery fires first-hand when a fire at a battery facility left four firefighters injured. Because the Salt River Project facility had been smoldering for days, the firefighters used an abundance of caution before entering the building.
Keith Welch, battalion chief at Chandler Fire Department said, “We took a defensive strategy and for us that means we’re not going to open the door and go in without personnel to take a look because we know some of the potential hazards of the battery degradation and the off-gassing and the different hazards that can cause.”
Due to potentially hazardous gases leaking from the building, businesses in the area were asked to evacuate Thursday night as the robot opened the doors and entered the facility, allowing the gases to dissipate. The next day the robots were sent back in to measure gases before firefighters could enter.
The Salt River Project was announced in 2018 in conjunction with AES Corporation and with the storage solution supplied by Fluence. The plan for the project was to provide power to Salt River Project customers during high peak demand periods, and the project would also serve as an initiative to learn more about grid-scale battery storage. Salt River Project customers have had no interruption in service as a result of the fire.
An AES spokesperson said it’s too early to speculate on the cause.

In the study “Investigation of optical and electrical properties of novel 4T all perovskite tandem solar cell,” published in scientific reports, the researchers explained that they utilized a three-dimensional (3D) finite element method (FEM), which is a numerical technique used to perform finite element analysis (FEA) of any given physical phenomenon, for the numerical modeling of the 4T cell.
The tandem device is claimed to have low production costs, high efficiency, excellent mechanical flexibility, and self-cleaning and eco-friendly characteristics. The absorption properties of the wide bandgap (WBG) absorber material on top of the rear cell with a narrow bandgap (NBG) active layer were investigated for different cell configurations. “The electrical properties of each subcell and tandem device are analyzed for all of the considered cases, and the optimal structure is introduced to get the highest possible total power conversion efficiencies,” the Iranian group explained.
For the top subcell, the academics considered a perovskite known as MAGeI3, with an energy bandgap of 1.9 V, and a perovskite known as MASnI3, with an energy bandgap of 1.3 V, for the bottom subcell.
The semi-transparent top subcell was made with a transparent conductive oxide made of indium tin oxide (ITO), an electron transport material (ETM) based on titanium dioxide (TiO2), the MAGeI3 layer, a hole transport material (HTM) made of Spiro–OMeTAD, and a buffer layer relying on molybdenum oxide (MoOx). The bottom subcell layers from top to bottom are the ITO as the transparent conductive oxide (TCO), TiO2 as the ETM, MASnI3, Spiro–OMeTAD as the HTM and the gold (Ag) as the back-contact. “In order to design a flexible solar cell, we considered polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as the substrate of two sub cells,” the research team specified.
The highest efficiency value for the proposed cell configuration was initially found to be 24.65%. The scientists, however, proposed a design without the buffer layer and with the addition of anti-reflection layer (ARL) strategies, as well as the use of periodic nano-texture patterns. “By direct sputtering of the TCO on the HTM, not only parasitic absorption as optical loss will be reduced, but also an extra process step in the fabrication will be omitted,” they emphasized.
They also utilized a plasma-polymer-fluorocarbon (PPFC) coating on the plastic substrate as an ARL due to its low refractive index, excellent flexibility, nature of the superhydrophobic surface, high transmittance over a wide wavelength range, self-cleaning effect, and long-term environmental stability under high humidity, chemicals, and heat. Nano-photonic and nano-plasmonic structures were used to reduce total reflection losses at the wavelength range of 370–440 nm.
“The final structure is offered as a 4T tandem solar cell (TSC) that is environmentally friendly, extremely flexible, and has self-cleaning capability, with a total power conversion efficiency of 30.14%, which is greater than the total PCE of the reference structure by 22.27%,” the scientists concluded.

Singapore-based Sun Cable, the company planning on building the world’s biggest solar and battery energy storage project in the Northern Territory (NT) and exporting it to Singapore, has lodged an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) Summary revealing the full extent of its enormity.
According to the EIS, the $30 billion-plus Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPL), which already has financial support from Australian billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest, is set to generate its renewable energy via a 17-20 GW solar farm with 36-42 GWh of battery energy storage called the Powell Creek Solar Precinct, occupying 12,000 hectares in the NT’s Barkly region.

The Maverick prefabricated and pre-wired system, designed by Sydney manufacturer 5B, has been named as the preferred solar technology supplier for the AAPL project. Arrays will be arranged in blocks of approximately 23-28 MW DC peak capacity and tied into about 60 MWh of storage.
From the Powell Creek site, an 800 km 6.4 GW overhead transmission line will carry the solar energy to the Darwin Converter Site at Murrumujuk, where approximately 800 MW of it will be supplied to Darwin and for private industry offtake. The rest will push on to Cable Transition Facilities at Gunn Point Beach where up to six 4,200 km subsea cable system laid parallel will transmit the energy to Singapore. 
The document presents the project’s key benefits as being the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 480 million tonnes over the project’s 70-year lifespan (equivalent to the average electricity used by more than 2.5 million Australian homes annually, and saving 10% of the NT’s greenhouse gas emissions). 
Moreover, the megaproject will create 1,750 construction jobs in the NT as well as 350 long-term operational jobs. 
Sun Cable chief executive David Griffin told the ABC: “The lodgement of the EIS to the NT [Environment Protection Authority] is a significant milestone for the AAPowerLink.”
Of course, no megaproject is without potentially negative environmental impacts. The EIS report identified impacts on vulnerable plant species including Darwin Cycads and Typhonium pratermissum at the Converter site. 
According to the ABC, the project’s proponents said it was unlikely to affect fauna, such as the Greater Bilby, the Yellow-spotted Monitor and eight threatened species of migratory shorebirds. Nor are the cables said to have impacts of extra noise and electromagnetic fields on turtles, dugongs, pygmy blue whales and whale sharks. 
United States-based engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) giant Bechtel, North American transmission specialist Hatch, professional services firms Marsh and PwC Australia, and Australia-headquartered engineering outfit SMEC, a member of the Singapore-based Surbana Jurong Group, have been listed as members of the project delivery team.
The AAPowerLink is the latest in a long line of renewable energy projects SMEC has worked on in Australia. The company said it has been directly involved in the development of more than 6.4 GW worth of utility-scale solar farms in Australia, including Risen Energy’s 100 MW Yarranlea Solar Farm in Queensland and the massive 720 MW New England Solar Farm being developed in New South Wales by UPC/AC Renewables Australia.
SMEC is also involved in Project EnergyConnect, a 900km proposed electricity interconnector being delivered by network operators TransGrid and ElectraNet and the $4.6 billion Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project, which when complete will provide 2 GW of dispatchable, on-demand renewable power and approximately 350 GWh of large-scale energy storage to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Sun Cable believes the project will have the capacity to supply 15% of Singapore’s energy requirements. The financial close of the project is expected in late 2023, with construction beginning as early as 2024. An Indigenous Land Use Agreement is under negotiation with the native title holders through the Northern Land Council. 
The EIS is open for public submissions until July 15.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/04/27/utility-scale-solar-inverters-need-improved-commissioning-and-upkeep/,"INVERTERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 27, 2022",Utility scale solar inverters need improved commissioning and upkeep,"From pv magazine USA
The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has released a report, Multiple Solar PV Disturbances in CAISO, which discusses why more than 100 utility scale solar plants and a significant amount of distributed solar shed gigawatts of capacity during grid fault events in the spring and summer of 2021. This document complements the Odessa Disturbance, with NERC building upon the recommended policy changes.
The cascading nature of these events — due to the failure of a single piece of hardware — is reminiscent of the Northeast Blackout of 2003.
The reports do, optimistically, point toward the solvable nature of many of these issues via additional commissioning requirements, and possibly via high-level data monitoring. Some of the issues include onsite operations and maintenance teams that were not able to access passwords to equipment onsite, and were unable to change inverter settings.

However, it is clear that there is an issue, since there have been four events within the CAISO region within about two months time. Between these events, a cumulative 3.1 GW of capacity was dropped.
The four events were touched off by a phase-to-phase fault on a 500 kV line, two fires and their smoke that set off nearby 500 kV lines, and a tripped transformer that connected a 500 kV and 500/230 kV set of lines.
The solar facilities reacted in a variety of ways, and analysis found many individual faults within the plants that led to the gigawatts of shed generation. Most of the capacity that was shed did immediately return to generation, however, several large blocks of generation took longer to get back online.
One of the broader issues stemmed from a lack of data collectors in specific places, which meant that NERC was unable to obtain explicit data showing why these sites stayed down longer than intended. NERC hypothesized that this was the result of inverter settings, though unfortunately, those settings are not available.

To head off the issue of not knowing for sure where the issues are, NERC ‘strongly recommends all newly connecting bulk power system (bps)-connected inverter-based resources to be equipped with at least the following pieces of data collecting gear:
Additionally, simply having better access to records and passwords of facilities was high on the list of needed improvements. The report notes that as plants have changed hands, the operations and maintenance teams haven’t always been given proper records of hardware installed or replacement records. This is in addition to simply not having passwords.
The password issue was made more challenging by multiple inverter manufacturers that have gone out of business, suggesting that the in-house password workarounds that might exist within the IT teams could be lost to the fog of corporate evolution.
Most of the additional recommendations unique to the CAISO report versus the initial Odessa report can be summarized as NERC pushing CAISO to implement standards they had previously recommended, and for better monitoring of sites.
If anything, the people working on reliability appear to be zeroing in on a specific set of challenges.
