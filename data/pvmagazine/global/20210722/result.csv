The amount of contracted energy – 21.4 average MW in the A-3 auction and 17.6 average MW in the A-4 exercise – is relatively lower than in previous years, with demand pressured by the economic slowdown. The value of the contracted energy is expressed in average MW, which represents its contracting limit.
Final prices were BRL 122 ($23.80)/MWh on average in the A-3 round and BRL 136.75 /MWh on average in the A-4.
In 2019, the lowest price for solar was BRL 66.43/MWh, but the share of energy reserved for the free market was higher, at roughly 66%. This energy was sold at higher prices under a power purchase agreement with a private customer.
According to the president of Absolar, Rodrigo Sauaia, there was a welcome “rationalization” of prices in the most recent auctions.
“We saw a more robust basis for contracting in the regulated market, for a more rational value,” he said. “This is an interesting sign, which shows that there is room for this type of project to allocate more energy in the regulated market.”
Winning bids
For example, one of the projects selected in the A-5 auction, the Santa Luzia VII solar park, sold a total of 93% of its capacity in the two auctions, with 40% in the A-3 and 53% in the A-4, at BRL 137.40/MWh and BRL 138.50/MWh, respectively. The plant will be built by Brazilian developer Rio Alto Energia in Paraíba, together with the Santa Luzia IX park, which was contracted on the A-4 exercise, and another one being built outside the auction scheme and called Santa Luzia V. Each of the three projects has a capacity of 50 MW.
Another selected project was the Boa Hora plant, in the state of Pernambuco. It consists of the Boa Hora 4, 5 and 6 projects, each with 23 MW of capacity and each selling 1.8 average MW of capacity in the A-3 auction for R$ 120/MWh. This means that most of their capacity will be made available for the free market.
“Many players are investing resources and teams to develop projects on the free market,” Sauaia said. “So they enter the auction and are not necessarily ‘bidding,' because they have the contract price reference in the free market.”
An impressive 16.9 GW from 408 solar projects were allowed to participate in the A-3 and 19.5 GW coming from 464 projects in the A-4 exercise, with the same projects often participating to both auctions.
The results of the latest auctions also confirmed solar's competitiveness against other sources.
“The last auctions again show how PV is the most competitive technology in terms of assigned prices,” Josefin Berg, manager of clean energy technology research at IHS Markit, told pv magazine. “Prices are low, but since projects take three to four years to complete, winners expect costs to decline.”
In the A-3 rond, solar contracts were closed at BRL 122/MWh, on average, below biomass, wind, and hydropower. In the A-4 round, the average price for solar was BRL 136/MWh.
So far, 835 solar projects, or 32,254 GW, have been registered to participate in the A-5  auction, geared for power delivery from 2026. The tender will be held on Sept. 30, 2021.

Van Aubel specializes in incorporating solar cells into furniture, windows, and other objects. In this project, she utilized Armor's ‘ASCA' organic transparent solar cells to create colored modules in which the lines and patterns are interacting with each other.
The transparent panels produce electricity for the pavilion and simultaneously allow sunlight into its spaces and filter the light's spectrum to enable the photosynthesis of the plants located inside the building. “Van Aubel demonstrates that solar panels, whilst collecting energy, can be beautiful and a form of art too,” Armor said in a statement, adding that the graphic design is made with a colored Moiré effect, which is an interference pattern produced by overlaying similar but slightly offset templates.
The ASCA cells have a power of up to 40 W/m², a weight of 500g/m², and a thickness of 400 μm. The manufacturer can produce them in different colors including red, blue, green and gray. Dimensions and design are customizable, as well as maximum current and maximum voltage.
In October 2020, Armor said its flexible and semi-transparent ASCA film had reached an efficiency of 26%. Its solar technology is mainly used to supply electricity to small connected objects indoors in environments where the light is low (from 200 lux), such as temperature sensors, presence detectors, and trackers for the geolocation of goods, medical equipment, or people.

U.S.-based start-up EcoFlow this week presented its latest portable battery, for which it started a crowdfunding campaign on its Kickstarter platform.
According to the Californian company, the EcoFlow Delta Pro system can be expanded to a capacity of up to 25 kWh and can be fully charged in less than two hours. The device is claimed to be the first battery in the industry that can be linked to multiple energy sources. The emergency power consumption of an average family can be covered for a week with just one charge, according to the manufacturer.
The basic version of the portable battery has a capacity of 3.6 kWh, which can be increased to 10.8 kWh by coupling two additional batteries, the company stated. By linking it with other smart home products, the capacity can be increased to 12.5 kWh or 25 kWh, making the storage system an emergency power solution or suitable for an independent power supply.
EcoFlow names photovoltaics, wind power and gas as possible charging sources for its product. With the right accessories, the possible uses could be expanded and the home battery could be linked to several power sources and the power supply controlled.
In addition, charging of electric vehicles with up to 3,000 W is supported via the charging station, the EcoFlow Smart Home Panel, or via a 230 V socket. The input power can be increased to up to 6,000 W if the EcoFlow Delta Pro is connected to a “smart extra battery” and is additionally charged with a photovoltaic system and a “smart generator,” according to the U.S. company.
EcoFlow specifies the original AC output power is 3,600 W, which can be expanded to 7,200 W. Then the battery could also be used to supply devices such as refrigerators or air conditioning systems with electricity.
Within the first few hours of the presentation of the product, the portable home battery was ordered by 1,323 customers. By Thursday noon, more than €3.9 million had been raised. The funding target, of almost €85,000, has been exceeded by far.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/22/australian-vandium-to-fast-track-manufacture-of-flow-batteries/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 22, 2021",Australian Vandium to fast-track manufacture of flow batteries,"Perth-based Australian Vanadium Limited (AVL) has secured a $3.69 million federal government manufacturing grant which will allow it to design, build and operate a $7.4 million commercial vanadium battery electrolyte plant in Western Australia (WA) and develop vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) prototypes for both off-grid and residential settings.
AVL managing director Vincent Algar said the matched-funding grant will also allow the company to finalize its high-purity vanadium pentoxide processing route as part of the development of its Australian Vanadium Project located in the Murchison province in WA.
AVL plans to supply vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) from the Australian Vanadium Project to manufacture vanadium electrolyte which will then be supplied to VRFB projects in Australia and in the Asia Pacific Region.
“The grant will provide support to AVL to achieve production of high-purity vanadium pentoxide, which is a key input to vanadium-titanium master alloys for critical steel applications and vanadium electrolyte for batteries,” Algar said. “The grant will allow AVL to produce vanadium electrolyte commercially to support the development of the long-duration energy storage market, which will play a key role in future grid stability in this renewable energy generation era.”
AVL said the electrolyte plant will be the first plant of its type in the region. Conditions of the grant dictate the manufacturing project must be fully completed by March 31, 2024.
Flow batteries are emerging as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries which currently dominate the energy storage sector.
Lithium-ion batteries are solid-state batteries, storing energy in metal, whereas flow batteries store energy in electrolyte liquids. They usually comprise two tanks, one containing a positively charged anode and the other with a negatively charged cathode, separated by a membrane.
Supporters of the technology claim using liquids allows flow batteries to produce electrical currents without degradation, giving the batteries a longer cycle life and allowing them to store charge for longer periods compared to lithium-ion batteries. It also makes them non-flammable and well-suited to Australian conditions.
Algar said the appeal of VFRB is clear, declaring them ideal for providing long-duration energy storage, from three to 12 hours, while vanadium electrolyte – which accounts for 30% to 60% of the cost of the battery, depending on how many hours of storage are required – can be leased to reduce capital cost and can be 100% reused or recycled at the end of the battery’s mechanical life
“VRFB battery systems are easier to manufacture than other batteries, due to the use of only a single metal component, vanadium, to store the energy,” Algar said.
“They are ideal for accelerating battery manufacturing in Australia, using locally produced vanadium and other battery components.”
AVL is one of eight companies in the resources technology and critical minerals sectors awarded a matched-funding grant under the Australian Government’s Resources Technology and Critical Minerals Processing National Manufacturing Priority roadmap.
Minister of Industry Science and Technology Christian Porter on Thursday announced almost $50 million had been allocated to the eight companies as part of the $1.3 billion Modern Manufacturing Initiative.
“Australia’s resource sector is world-class,” he said. “We are helping to unlock this enormous potential by providing targeted support for projects that will deliver big rewards for our local economy in terms of export earnings and new job opportunities.
“It is also critical that we build our sovereign capability in this sector, with China currently the world leader in critical minerals processing including battery production.”
“Whether it’s building large-scale battery systems, adding value to critical minerals exports through new refining techniques, or driving the adoption of battery power in mining vehicles, these projects will increase Australia’s international competitiveness and help position us a future leader in this crucial sector.”
Other recipients include New South Wales-based Batt Mobile Equipment which received $4.5 million in funding to build heavy battery electric vehicles (EVs) for underground hard rock mines.
Lynas Rare Earths will use its $14.8 million in funding to develop a world-first process to refine rare earth ore – essential for permanent magnet and EV production. The new refining process reduces the need for hazardous chemicals and delivers a significantly higher-grade product for export. The project will be based in WA’s Goldfields region.
Elphinstone in Tasmania will receive $5.1 million in funding to develop a range of battery-powered underground mining support vehicles that eliminate the need for diesel use in underground environments.
In the Northern Territory, Core Lithium will use its $6 million in funding to help build a pilot processing facility for the production of battery-grade lithium hydroxide while Queensland-based Brisbane METS Lab No. 1 will use its $1.2 million to develop its vanadium processing pilot plant.

And with the U.S. owned data company having plotted three routes to carbon neutrality, depending on the dominant power generation technology, the ‘green' scenario outlined in yesterday's study projected a need for 632 GW of solar per year for the next three decades, to attain a 20 TW global solar fleet in 2050.
That solar and wind-friendly green route to capping global heating at a maximum 1.75 degrees Celsius this century, would also require 257 GWh of new battery energy storage capacity for the next 29 years, to reach 7.7 TWh in mid century.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry, looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
The alternative scenarios envisioned by BNEF's analysts are a ‘red' outlook, which would rely on nuclear to lead the way, helped by the widespread roll-out of small, modular reactors; and a ‘grey' future, in which carbon capture tech enables the continued use of coal and gas.
In the green scenario, solar and wind power would rise from around 1.3% of the world's primary energy use today to 15% this decade and 70% by mid century. The grey alternative would see intermittent renewables account for 26% of primary energy and no estimate was provided for solar and wind in a nuclear future outlined by BNEF in a press release issued yesterday to publicize the report.
The most renewables-friendly of the three outcomes would drive a need for 121.5 PWh of electricity generation in 2050, according to BNEF, with 49% of it used to electrolyze 1.32 billion tons of green hydrogen in that year.
The analyst posited the 455 GW per year of solar required figure regardless of the dominant power generation technology, and said at least 505 GW of wind power would also need to come online, annually, this decade, plus 245 GWh of battery capacity and 35 million electric vehicles, to keep us on track whether it be in a green, red or grey decade.
With the power sector having to do most of the heavy lifting required to 2030, in terms of bringing down carbon emissions, BNEF said the current $1.7 trillion annual spend on energy infrastructure – including solar parks – would have to reach between $3.1 trillion and $5.8 trillion per year to 2050 for a total bill, by mid century, of $92-173 trillion, depending on the dominant technology type.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/22/heat-pumps-bankable-as-incentive-free-solutions-in-many-applications/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 22, 2021",Heat pumps bankable as incentive-free solutions in many applications,"Some heat pump (HP) manufacturers are now moving toward demonstrating and promoting PV-driven HP solutions on the market, but rooftop PV and HP systems are usually sold separately. They are also installed in separate phases or in a single intervention, without a specific energy management system to maximize self-production of thermal energy with PV generation.
“While these installations are nowadays the standard in residential and tertiary buildings, newly built constructions, the installation in retrofitted buildings are gaining market share, both pulled by energy efficiency regulations and voluntary certification schemes,” Roberto Fedrizzi, coordinator of the sustainable heating and cooling systems research group at Italian research institute Eurac, told pv magazine.

Although heat pump systems are now a market-mature technology, they are still inherently more expensive than conventional gas boiler plants, which represent the market benchmark. As a result, production volumes are not comparable.
“Electricity prices are in most EU member states relevantly higher – two to four times – than gas prices,” Fedrizzi explained. “This is the reason why energy efficiency regulations and public incentives are in place, trying to establishing a level playing field between technologies having reached different levels of industrial maturity, hence facilitating and accelerating the transition from fossil fuel-driven solutions.”
Economies of scale
Fedrizzi said growing sales numbers result in lower production costs, as economies of scale are occurring on the components and systems level.
“The heat pump systems are already a bankable solution even without incentives in many applications. In newly built tertiary buildings such as offices, hotels and supermarkets, where chillers are necessary for air-conditioning and refrigeration purposes in addition to the heat generator, installing a reversible heat pump system instead is the most effective investment,” he said, noting that in newly built, residential applications, HPs coupled to PV systems are the market standard.
“On the one hand, this is because they highly contribute to increasing the share of renewable energies exploited to cover both electric and thermal loads in a sector where energy efficiency is felt as a high priority by all stakeholders, from homeowners to decision-makers,” he explained. “On the other hand, they allow covering heating uses and cooling demand, which is more and more felt like a necessary commodity as a consequence of the global warming, with a unique generation unit.”
For newly built residential installations, the additional cost of an HP system is only marginal compared to a conventional gas boiler-plus-split-unit solution, while running costs are significantly lower.
“As an example, more than 50% of the new residential buildings built in Germany in 2020 were set up with an HP,” said David Moser, coordinator of the photovoltaic energy systems research group at Eurac.

Key barriers
“The main barriers to a faster adoption are mainly cultural and related to the structure of the construction market,” continued Fedrizzi. “With respect to the first factor, the construction sector tends to be conservative and changes slowly.”
In his view, the HP sector is mainly focused on generating knowledge and gaining the confidence of stakeholders for solutions that are not conventional.
“With respect to the second aspect, the newly built is only a share of the overall construction market,” he said. “The installation of HPs in retrofitted buildings, although technically suitable once more, requires modifications to the existing heating system and additional installations, compared to simply substituting the existing fossil-fuelled boiler with a new one; this results in longer installation times and higher investment costs, thus construction companies and homeowners often decide for the easiest and cheapest way, clearly far less energy efficient.”
To address this issue, technology providers and researchers are working on developing and marketing solutions that are incrementally easier installed and operated in retrofitted buildings, while providing homeowners with high energy efficiency and additional commodities like space cooling.
Market size
From a technology perspective, today's heat pumps can cover a wide temperature range.
“They still operate at -20 C and increasingly often they provide hot water at 65 C in an efficient manner,” Fedrizzi said. “That enables their deployment in a much larger share of buildings than a decade ago.”
According to the European Heat Pump Association's EU market report for 2021, sales in the European market exceeded 1.6 million units in 2020. The manufacturing sector is pursuing the goal of doubling annual sales by 2030, which would allow reaching about 50 million units installed by then. The actual prevailing technology is made of the air-to-water family of heat pumps with about 800,000 units sold in 2020, followed by air-to-air reversible units. Air source heat pumps are expected to improve further, both on the unit and systems level, as their lower investment costs and ease of installation will keep them in the lead.
The five biggest European heat pump markets in 2020 were France, with 394,000 units sold, followed by Italy with 232,000 systems, Germany with 140,000, Spain with 127,000, and Sweden with 107,000. The overall EU market grew by about 7% year on year in 2020. Air-to-water systems showed the most dynamic growth, both in terms of absolute and relative change. Sales of heating-only air/water heat pumps increased by 51,000 units (+15 %), and reversible air/water by 47,000 units (+25 %).
Proper sizing
When asked about the importance of the best sizing approach for solar-powered heat pumps, the two experts agreed that system dimensions are not a crucial factor, as the solutions on the market have PV independently installed from the HP.
“Indeed, as far as electricity injection in the grid is becoming less and less convenient, sizing and possibly orienting the PV field to account for the HP system electric loads, variable through the day and seasons, helps to address self-consumption vs. cost optimality,” Moser explained.
He said that additional benefits like demand-response services provided to the grid are in sight, although they haven't emerged yet.
“Watching at the problem from the HP perspective and having in mind that HP systems always have thermal storage capacity integrated – in the form of both thermal energy storage and the building mass –  managing the HP to consume electricity at high irradiation conditions, and to store thermal energy for later use, provides a cost-efficient option to balance fluctuating, renewable electricity generation,” said Fedrizzi.

That was one of many predictions made by the European solar industry body – many of them more upbeat – in its flagship Global Market Outlook For Solar Power 2021-2025 report, published yesterday.
While conceding the poly squeeze is unlikely to ease this year, SolarPower Europe said the upward pressure on prices appears to have peaked, according to last month's factory-gate numbers. The trade body says that is because of the rising volume of corporate-driven solar projects worldwide. If the price of panels becomes too expensive, unsubsidized solar parks planned by private businesses will simply not be built, and the world's solar manufacturers are aware of the fact, according to the authors of the market report.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at solar’s vital role in securing energy supply where conventional grids have struggled to reach. And don’t miss our In Conversation special: Over the past month, we have been in touch with leading researchers working on energy systems, solar cell technologies, battery storage, hydrogen and more; discussing the future of energy and the technologies we can expect to see a whole lot more of in the coming years.
The tone of the document was mostly upbeat, with the organization happily reporting the negative predictions made in last year's iteration of the outlook – written during the worst period to date of Europe's Covid-19 crisis – have mostly been revised upwards after solar weathered the public health storm much better than had been anticipated.
Rising Covid-19 vaccination rates and, pertinently on the polysilicon issue, plans to ramp up silicon production capacity have prompted the organization to make a slew of positive predictions, with SolarPower Europe predicting the world will add 163 GW of solar generation capacity this year, to reach 773 GW.
The world will break the 200 GW barrier for new solar next year – two years earlier than predicted by the lobby group a year ago – by adding 203 GW, and a further 225 GW will come online in 2023; 239 GW the following year; and 266 GW in 2025. That would add up to a global solar generation fleet of 1.8 TW by the middle of the decade, with the terawatt mark passed at some point next year. And that, SolarPower Europe added, is based on its medium-scenario expectations; in its most optimistic forecast, the world could have 2.15 TW of solar by the end of 2025, especially if mooted green hydrogen generation plants begin to take shape during that period.
Solar superpower China is expected to add up to 71 GW of capacity this year and SolarPower Europe predicted it will bring a further 76 GW online next year and then 85 GW, 91 GW and 102 GW, to 2025.
The changing of the guard in Washington could see the U.S. add 24.1 GW this year and peak at 28 GW of new solar in 2023, driven by an extended Investment Tax Credit for solar. After that, the U.S. will level off at around 25.5-26 GW per year, according to the report's authors.
With Germany set to add 6.2 GW this year; Denmark and Greece to join the gigawatt-market club and Turkey to regain admission, SolarPower Europe has predicted its home market will bring 37.4 GW online next year, rising to 45 GW in 2024, and 51 GW in 2025.
There was wide variance in the figures expected from India, after it's Covid-related solar slump last year, with the outlook guesstimating 5.6-10 GW could be added this year, depending on which of its scenarios is considered. That could leap to 18-22 GW next year, said the trade body, but with a solar fleet of 41 GW at the time of publication, the 100 GW solar target set by prime minister Narendra Modi for next year is more likely to be achieved in 2024, after around 19 GW of plants comes online in each of 2023 and 2024.
SolarPower Europe said enthusiasm for rooftop solar would ensure Mexico adds 2.3 GW this year, despite the fossil fuel-focused policies of president Andrés Manuel López Obrador but noted solar installation volumes are expected to retreat in Japan, Australia, South Korea and Taiwan, as well as in Ukraine, after the government's retroactive reduction of feed-in tariffs (FITs).
The annual report also offered an interesting insight into the best performing nations in terms of the volume of solar capacity installed per citizen, with Australia topping the ranking with 826 W of solar for every resident. Germany boasted 652 W per capita, followed by the Netherlands (603 W), Japan (563 W), Belgium (540 W), Switzerland (354 W), Italy (350 W), Greece (315 W), Spain (303 W) and Israel (301 W).
The membership body behind the report noted new, vaccination-resistant variants of Covid-19 might pose a significant threat to the solar success story. The allegations of forced labor in Xinjiang, China which have prompted the Biden administration in the U.S. to announce an intent to boycott such goods could also prove a fly in the ointment, especially if other nations follow America's lead, SolarPower Europe noted, while considering either roadblock unlikely.
With the outlook including reports from solar associations in each of the world's gigawatt solar markets, perusal of the national round-ups revealed Ghana‘s off-grid commercial and industrial PV segment is being hindered by unspecified domestic content rules; Australia's solar industry could explode to more than 120 GW if vast green hydrogen and green ammonia facilities come to fruition; Mexico's political troubles mean it will add less than a gigawatt of big solar parks annually for the foreseeable future; and 5,000 people left Ukraine's solar industry last year, in the wake of FIT cuts and an ongoing suspension of planned renewables auctions which were set to start, under new rules, in December 2019.

NASA selected five companies to compete for the development of the device. Lockheed Martin, Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology, California-based ATK Space Systems, New York-based Honeybee Robotics, and Palo Alto-based Space Systems Loral will all bid for the contract. NASA has already awarded initial $700,000 contracts to each of the competing companies. The two winning companies will then each receive an additional $7.5 million to build prototypes and run environmental tests.
NASA researchers have described the “Relocatable Solar Array” (RSA) as a pair of solar cell blankets freely hanging from a horizontal cross arm supported by a vertical telescoping mast on a deployable tripod base. The device must be retractable and movable, but must be as mechanically simple as possible. The mast supporting the 50-kg array should be 16 meters high and will be placed on a deployable tripod base.
“NASA is not looking at terrestrial applications of the vertical solar array,” Richard Pappa, a space structures engineer at the NASA Langley Research Center, told pv magazine.
NASA said in a statement in March that “existing space-rated solar array structures and deployment systems are designed for use in microgravity or horizontal surface deployment … The vertical position and height of these new designs will help prevent loss of power at the lunar poles where the sun does not rise very far above the horizon.”
The scientists explained that the tall vertical structure increases the chances of receiving uninterrupted light. NASA said the force exerted by lunar gravity in the proposed design will be used to maintain the extension of the hanging array blankets.
“A second major factor in achieving the desired low mass and high volumetric efficiency is that the array operates in the vacuum, low-gravity, lunar environment with no deployed vibration frequency requirement,” the agency said. “Such a low-load environment enables use of extraordinarily slender and low mass structural members to support the hanging array blankets.”
The need for low mass and low package volumes creates design constraints, including the mast's thickness and diameter. It will also complicate the proper sizing for joints, latches, actuators, and slender structures, said NASA.

With this tweet, the energy minister of the Belgian region of Flanders, Zuhal Demir, has commented on the outcome of the region's first renewables auction, whose details were provided by local newspaper De Tijd.
In the procurement exercise, the Flemish energy agency – the Vlaams Energie- en Klimaatagentschap (VEKA) – has selected 79 renewable energy projects, of which 59 projects, totaling 33 MW, were for solar arrays.
The PV projects secured a tariff ranging from €0.0321 to €0.15/kWh depending on their size. The ceiling prices for the auction had been set at €0.22/kWh. Overall, solar secured around €4 million of the €5 million budget that the VEKA had earmarked for the procurement exercise.
The next auction is planned to be launched in September.
Flanders is Belgium's region with the largest share of solar capacity. According to the latest statistics from local renewable association Apere, it accounted for around 800 MW of the 1 GW installed in the country last year. The region's cumulative installed solar power reached 4.4 GW at the end of 2020.
The region is also supporting rooftop PV through a rebate scheme.

A 500 MW pumped energy storage project proposed by the City of San Diego and the San Diego County Water Authority has secured $18 million from the California state budget. The support will help fund the San Vicente Energy Storage Facility through initial design, environmental reviews, and the federal licensing process.
If built, the project would provide long-duration stored energy and is seen by its backers as an asset that would help to avoid rolling blackouts through on-demand energy production. It could also generate revenue to help offset the cost of water purchases, storage, and treatment.
With the state funding, the San Diego County Water Authority and the city now plan to start federal and state environmental reviews. They will seek a project license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and issue a request for proposals for a partner to help develop the project. Those steps are expected to take at least four years, with construction completion forecast for 2030.
As planned, the San Vicente project would create a small upper reservoir above the existing San Vicente Reservoir, along with a tunnel system and an underground powerhouse to connect the two reservoirs. The powerhouse would contain four reversible pump turbines. The project could store 4,000 MWh per day of energy (500 MW of capacity for eight hours)
