Toyota Motor Europe said it would establish a local business operation, the Hydrogen Factory Europe, to ensure a coordinated approach to commercializing hydrogen technology and systems in the continent. “The Hydrogen Factory will be responsible for producing an increasing number of fuel cell systems and supporting a widening group of commercial partnerships,” said the Japanese automotive company.
Asahi Kasei is launching a demonstration trial of a rental service for chlor-alkali electrolysis cells in Europe with Nobian and Logisteed. The Japanese technology company explained that the service can help customers maintain production capacity when repairing their own equipment. The membrane process for chlor-alkali electrolysis produces chlorine, hydrogen, and caustic soda by electrolyzing brine using ion-exchange membranes. Global demand for chlor-alkali in 2022 was approximately 100 million tons2, and Asahi Kasei's chlor-alkali process has been adopted at more than 150 plants in 30 countries, with a total capacity of over 30 million tons per year converted to 100% caustic soda. Asahi Kasei plans to expand the rental service to Asia and North America.

The main European electricity markets registered a decrease in solar energy production in the week of Nov. 27 compared to the seven days prior. The German market registered the largest decline of 59%, followed by 45% in Spain, 44% in Portugal, 27% in France and 19% in Italy.
According to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s solar energy production forecasts, PV production will recover in Spain in the first week of December, while it will continue to decline in Italy and Germany.


As for wind energy production, the Italian, Spanish and Portuguese markets registered an increase in production during the week of Nov. 27 compared to the week of Nov. 20. Italy increased by 32%, Spain increased by 7.7% and Portugal increased by 3.0%. In the German market, wind energy production decreased by 54%, while in decreased by 19% in France.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s wind energy production forecasts indicate an increase in wind energy production in most of the analyzed markets – except in Italy – for the week of Dec. 4.

Electricity demand
Electricity demand increased in all major European electricity markets in the last week of November compared to the previous seven days. Great Britain registered a 15% increase while France clocked in 14%. Portugal saw the smallest increase of 2.3%. In all other markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, demand variations ranged from 2.6% in Italy to 8.5% in the Netherlands.
Falling average temperatures led to increasing demand. In the markets of Germany, France, Great Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands, average temperatures fell by more than 3 C during the week of Nov. 27 compared to the previous week. The Dutch market registered the largest decrease of 5.9 C. Markets located towards the south of Europe saw smaller variations. Italy's average temperature decreased by 0.5 °C, while Spain's temperature increased by 0.1 C and Portugal's increased by 0.4 C.
According to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s demand forecasts, demand for electricity will continue to grow in Germany, Great Britain and the Netherlands in the first week of December. Spain celebrates the Spanish Constitution Day on Dec. 6 and Spain, Portugal and Italy celebrate the Immaculate Conception on Dec. 8. These holidays will favor a drop in demand in these markets, but demand will recover in Portugal after the Dec. 1 holiday and is expected to exceed numbers from the week of Nov. 27. Demand will fall in France and Belgium.

European electricity markets
Daily prices in most main European electricity markets increased during the week of Nov. 27. Thursday, Nov. 30 saw the highest prices. Although daily prices followed a downward trend in the Iberian market since the beginning of the week, on average they were higher than those of the previous week. As a result, the weekly averages of all electricity markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting were higher than the previous week. Germany's EPEX SPOT market saw the largest price rise of 37% while Italy's IPEX market had the smallest increase of 1.8%. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices increased between 26% in the N2EX market of the United Kingdom and 35% in the MIBEL market of Spain and Portugal.
In the last week of November, weekly averages were above €130/MWh in most of the analyzed European electricity markets. The exceptions were Portugal and Spain's MIBEL market, clocking in €93.94/MWh and €94.04/MWh, respectively, and the Nordic country's Nord Pool market registering €102.27/MWh. The British market saw the highest average of €139.03/MWh. Prices ranged from €131.82/MWh in the German market to €134.04/MWh in the Italian market.
On Thursday, Nov. 30, from 17:00 to 18:00, the German, Belgian, French and Dutch markets registered hourly prices above €260/MWh. The highest prices were those of Germany and the Netherlands, €261.00/MWh in both cases. The French market price, €260.95/MWh, was the highest since the end of August in that market. On Monday, Dec. 4, from 8:00 to 9:00, the Nordic market registered a price of €199.93/MWh, the highest since December 2022.
During the week of November 27, the general increase in electricity demand and the fall in solar energy production had an upward influence on European market prices. In addition, wind energy production fell in some markets, such as Germany and France.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s price forecasts indicate that in the first week of December, prices in the European electricity markets might decrease. The increase in wind energy production in most of the analyzed markets could contribute to this behavior.

Brent, fuels and CO2
Brent oil futures for the Front‑Month in the ICE market started the last week of November with a slight price decline from the previous week. However, prices rose again on Tuesday and Wednesday. These futures registered their weekly maximum settlement price, $83.10/bbl, on Wednesday, Nov. 29. On the remaining days of the last week of November, prices declined to reach the weekly minimum settlement price, $78.88/bbl, on Friday, Dec. 1.
Expectations about the OPEC+ meeting on Thursday, Nov. 30, exerted an upward influence on prices in the first half of the week. However, the production cuts announced by OPEC+ for the first quarter of 2024, which will be voluntary, did not offset the downward influence caused by concerns about the evolution of the global economy in the last sessions of the week.
As for settlement prices of TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front‑Month, these were below €44/MWh in the last week of November. On Monday, Nov. 27, TTF gas futures reached the weekly maximum settlement price of €43.98/MWh. This price was already 5.7% lower than in the last session of the previous week. Prices declined on Tuesday and Wednesday. These futures registered their weekly minimum settlement price, €40.36/MWh, on Wednesday, Nov. 29. According to data analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, this price was the lowest since Oct. 6. In the last sessions of the week, prices recovered. On Friday, Dec. 1, the settlement price was €43.50/MWh.
During the last week of November, high European reserves and abundant supply allowed TTF gas futures prices to be below €44/MWh, despite the increase in demand due to the cold snap on the continent. On the other hand, forecasts of less cold temperatures might exert a downward influence on prices in the coming days.
As for CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of Dec. 2023, they reached their weekly maximum settlement price, €73.64/t, on Monday, Nov. 27. This price was 3.9% lower than in the last session of the previous week. During the week, settlement prices declined until Thursday, Nov. 30. On that day, these futures registered their weekly minimum settlement price, €70.81/t. This price was the lowest since October 2022 for the reference contract of December of that year. On Friday, the settlement price increased to €72.49/t, under the influence of the increase in demand due to low temperatures.

TotalEnergies had 12 GW of solar projects currently operating, with 3.8 GW under construction and 25.5 GW in the pipeline, according to the report. But Mercom said that a “significant share” of TotalEnergies’ operational capacity originated from its 50% stake in Clearway Energy Group, 49% stake in Casa dos Ventos and 20% stake in Adani Green Energy.
Italian renewable energy company Enel Green Power was the second-largest utility-scale solar developer with 9.2 GW in its portfolio. Indian renewable company Adani Green – owned by Indian energy giant Adani Group – trailed in third place with 18.1 GW.
The report ranks international large-scale PV developers and projects based on the operational capacity of projects over 1 MW, spanning projects running now, those under construction and others awarded power purchase agreements (PPA), Mercom said in the press release.
Roughly 191 GW of utility-scale solar was installed in 2022, with the combined capacities of the top 10 developers reaching nearly 145 GW, according to the report. Over half of the top 10 developers were based in Europe, with three in North America and one in Asia.
“Increased urgency” to meet renewable energy targets and meet net zero initiatives resulted in a “significant number of projects” being developed or planned, Mercom said in the report.
China installed the most solar capacity out of all countries with 86 GW cumulative capacity – a 62.4% increase from the year prior, the report states. The US installed the second largest amount, 17.6 GW, which is 8.3% down from the year before.
Mercom attributed the US' “module supply uncertainty” to the federal anti-circumvention investigation, which in August determined four Chinese solar module manufacturing companies skirted antidumping and countervailing tariffs by sending products to Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam for minor processing, the US Department of Commerce said.
The Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act – an instrument banning the import of products suspected of being made with forced labor in China – also held back installations, Mercom said, adding it expects the Inflation Reduction Act, approved in 2022, will provide the industry a shot in the arm.
India recorded the third-largest amount of installations, clocking in 13 GW in 2022 – a 29% rise from the year before.

Among the raft of Ecodesign amendments was the introduction of a digital product passport. The European Commission proposal states the passport is an electronic register of a product’s environmental sustainability data.
The aim of the passport is to facilitate and streamline the “monitoring and enforcement” of European Union and Member State legislation, which is expected to “increase transparency” for supply chain businesses and the general public.
If supported, the passport would be developed in an “open dialogue” with international partners to lower costs for sustainable investments, marketing, and compliance, among other factors. Industry associations, consumer organizations, non-governmental organizations and international partners would also help build the passport’s technical specifications related to “traceability.”
The European Commission would retain the data, with customs officials and national governments also having access to ensure products comply with federal and European Union laws. Member states would impose national penalties for non-compliance.
Food, feed, medical products for human use, veterinary products, living plants and animals, products of human origin, and plant and animal products related to future reproduction, would be exempt from having passports, according to the proposal.
The provisional agreement needs to be endorsed and formally adopted by the European Commission and European Parliament before coming into effect, according to the European Commission press release.
The news comes as the European Solar Manufacturing Council and SolarPower Europe were at alleged loggerheads over whether the European Union should ban products made with forced labor.

The global change in energy supply is taking place faster than expected but such knowledge has not led to more accurate forecasts.
DR Dahlmeier Financial Risk Management AG
With empirically-based modelling the most reliable approach, DR Dahlmeier Financial Risk Management has applied it to the anticipated growth of PV to 2030 – with surprising results.
Previous technological transitions, as analyzed by Doyne Farmer and his Oxford University team, have begun with exponential growth followed by linear growth before levelling off, in a characteristic “s-curve.”
The volume of PV deployed worldwide has roughly doubled every two years over the past 48 years. Each doubling has brought a price reduction of around 23% and there is little variance from that pattern.
At some point the incline should become more gentle but when will that happen for solar?
The graph below shows the energy markets where new-build solar or wind sites were cheaper than new coal and gas power plants, during the first half of 2022. Current solar panel prices already make the estimates used below look costly.

Source: BloombergNEF
In almost all industrialized countries, wind or solar energy is the cheapest source of electricity from new large-scale plants. Photovoltaic power plants undercut production costs of around $0.01/kWh in 2020, in sunny regions, and the current PV price trend enables even lower production costs. The average costs shown in the Bloomberg chart above could be significantly undercut with new systems. Since November 2022 alone, PV module prices have roughly halved, to a record low. To put that into perspective, electricity prices on the European Energy Exchange in Leipzig averaged €30 ($32.64) per megawatt-hour in 2020 and have fluctuated between €77/MWh and €102/MWh since March 2023. Photovoltaic electricity from large systems has, therefore, not only long been competitive it is now by far the cheapest source of electricity from new systems.
Pricing is different for small systems, where final electricity consumption price is the decisive factor. Self-generated solar power is already cheaper than grid electricity almost everywhere, making home solar systems economically attractive.
Solar module prices have fallen more than 99.8% since 1976. Study of almost 3,000 forecasts has revealed just how unambitious analysts have been in predicting solar panel price declines. Between 2010 and 2020, the most ambitious analysts predicted a 6% annual fall in price, with predictions averaging out at 2.6% per year. Prices actually retreated 15% per year.
Those inaccurate price predictions affected the resulting solar deployment forecasting models, particularly the integrated assessment models (IAMs) which dominate economic modelling. pv magazine has reported on unambitious modeling and forecasts, particularly by the IEA.
What alternative modelling approaches exist?
Using an empirical approach, my team estimates solar’s exponential expansion phase will continue beyond 2030. We expect the volume of installed solar generation capacity to rise from 1.24 TW, in 2022, to around 14 TW in 2030. The module price will fall from $0.22 per Watt-peak of generation capacity, in summer 2023, to $0.097/Wp in 2030. Global volume will rise by a factor of 11 and the price will more than halve. The following chart shows the expected volume growth and price reduction from 2023 as a forecast based on previous developments.

Trend extrapolation from 2023 to 2030, shown in double logarithmic scaling
Conservative estimates indicate the result would be a consistent solar energy generation cost of less than $0.02/kWh in central Europe and below $0.01/kWh in Southern Europe and the southern United States.
Our empirical modelling is characterized by transparent, comprehensible assumptions and lower complexity than the dominant approach. The modelling developed by our team – independently of Farmer, at Oxford University – delivers fundamentally identical results. Thus, our methodology can be regarded as independently validated by that of Oxford University. While other models do not aim to apply to historical development, empirical modelling integrates historical figures and builds on them.

Presentation of the historical and expected development in PV until 2030
The expected deployment figures are reflected in the chart above.
The modelling is based on a large number of technology transitions. Deviations from the trend are possible. Solar development may be faster or slower but the trend provides the expected value, or forecast, of 14 TW globally and a module price of $0.097/Wp. We do not derive any statements about national or regional development from the model at this point.
As pv magazine has reported, non-empirical modelling approaches have prompted much lower forecasts. For example, analyst Wood Mackenzie’s “Q3 2023 Global solar market outlook update” produced a 2030 figure of 3.65 TW of solar. Our estimate is for 2.8 TW of solar in 2029 alone.
The seasonal, December and January edition of pv magazine, fresh out today, reveals the much-anticipated winners of this year’s pv magazine Awards. We also consider the ramifications of the current global oversupply of solar panels, Australia’s prospects of refining battery raw materials, and examine how the European Union’s green hydrogen ambitions are developing.
Is that too optimistic, given the much-publicized problem of storing electricity generated by intermittent renewables? This issue has been resolved in principle. US-based investor Warren Buffett's Gemini solar project provides round-the-clock solar power, supported by battery storage, for $0.033/kWh. The ultra-high-voltage, direct current transmission system installed by ABB in China transmits electricity 3,200 km – between Changji and Guquan – with low losses. Those two projects demonstrate 24/7 solar power can be delivered economically almost anywhere. The United Kingdom is planning the “Xlinks Morocco-UK Power Project” and Egypt, Cyprus, and Greece are planning similar infrastructure.
Based on empirical evidence, the long-term global exponential trend for solar is unlikely to slow down before the end of the decade and probably not before 2034, if only due to the favorable prices of solar power from new systems. How this global trend will continue, whether it will increasingly focus on sunny regions, and whether such regions will sell us energy in the form of electricity in the future or whether PV electricity will be produced and stored locally, depends on politics.
Renewables not only have the potential to enable a CO2-neutral economy. They are already a basis for stable economic growth on the path to global climate neutrality and they help to reduce energy costs. We should utilize the opportunities that present themselves, also in terms of limiting climate change and of carrying out our responsibility for the planet.

CleanCo has signed an agreement with Coles to supply its supermarkets in Queensland with power from Neoen’s recently completed 400 MW Western Downs Green Power Hub solar farm – the largest solar farm in Australia.
CleanCo and Coles signed a 10-year contract back in 2020 to power more than 90% of its Queensland sites from July 2022 with renewable energy. Later the same year, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced that the government had signed a deal with French renewable energy provider Neoen for CleanCo to buy 320 MW of the output of Neoen’s Western Downs Green Power Hub, which paved the way for construction on the project to begin.
The large-scale solar farm near the town of Chinchilla was completed in April of this year and gained a battery delivered by construction contractor UGL in July, featuring Tesla Megapack 2XL units. Neoen said at the time that the battery would give the farm greater capacity and enable a wider range of services and solutions.
With these different milestones and existing agreements, the agreement now announced by the Queensland government and CleanCo is presumably to secure the power now being generated by Neoen’s 400 MW Western Downs Green Power Hub solar farm for Coles stores.
WThanks to the completion of the country’s largest solar farm and this landmark partnership, more than 95% of our electricity needs in Queensland are supplied by CleanCo,” said Coles Queensland State Manager Jo Brown.
Claims of supplying an entity’s energy needs with renewables usually only describe the energy demand in buildings  – without including the energy used for transport, such as for Coles delivery services, for example. This appears to be the case here, as the supermarket duopoly has only just started electrifying its delivery fleets.
As these are transitioned off fossil fuels, Coles’ electricity needs will increase as its carbon footprint decreases. Strictly speaking, bringing the company’s total energy consumption to 95% renewable energy use will only be achieved if these vehicles are supplied with renewable energy as well. The first fully electric delivery van was welcomed to the Coles Queensland fleet in August of this year.

PCMs are substances that can absorb and release heat energy during phase transitions. The PCMs used in this study were natural beeswax, paraffin wax, and a combination of both. They absorb heat when changing from solid to liquid and release it when transforming back.
“This study aims to evaluate the effect of integrating phase-change materials with solar panels and passive cooling under the influence of Iraqi weather conditions, which are characterized by their heat,” the academics from the Northern Technical University said. “We compare the performance under these conditions in terms of electrical efficiency, panel temperature, and electrical output through experimental work.”
For their experimental setting, the scientists placed four 50 W panels with polycrystalline cells on a rooftop in the city of Hawija, northern Iraq. One panel was kept in its original condition for reference, while the other three had cavities in their back to contain the different PCMs. The five-liter cavity was then filled with the various waxes, with 10% space left empty for solidification.
The group took the measurements on a July day in 2022 with the ambient temperature reaching 43.5 C and solar radiation values ranging from 300 to 956 W/m2. Different measurement instruments were installed in this rig to measure the panel’s temperature, electricity production, and efficiency.
The analysis showed that the panel without a PCM had temperatures ranging from 38.65 to 69.4 C, with an average daily temperature of 54.7 C. By contrast, the PV module with paraffin reached an average of 54.21 C, with the panel relying on beeswax averaging 51.66 C. The panel with both materials, meanwhile, achieved an average of 53.62 C.
All three PCM PVs acted similarly, having lower temperatures than the reference PV until between 2:00 pm and 3:00 pm, when the wax melted. Afterward, as it could not absorb any more heat, the wax froze, emitting heat and therefore raising the panel temperature to higher levels than the reference set-up.
“Regarding electrical generation, the average daily electrical output was 28, 28.5, 31, and 28.7 watts for the reference plate, paraffin, beeswax, and PV mixture,” the academic group added. “The electrical efficiency of beeswax improved by 1% compared to the reference rig. As for the other two types, the improvement was very slight.”
The research group shared its results in the study “Comparative study of different phase change materials on the thermal performance of photovoltaic cells in Iraq’s climate conditions,” published in Energy Reports.

Their method utilizes a calculation model for frost growth rate, providing an in-depth investigation of heat pump defrost cycles.
The technique considers a hot-gas bypass method for defrosting. “When the temperature drops below freezing, frost could accumulate on the outdoor unit of the air-source heat pump and cause a drop in performance; hence a mode is triggered to remove the frost build-up,” the researchers explained.
With the hot gas bypass method, the refrigerant completely skips the condenser and expansion valve lines and directly flows from the compressor to the evaporator. “This would lead to lower heat output affecting the dwelling demand,” they stressed.
In order to foresee energy consumption and heat output by the heat pump, the scientists have created a computerized model that considers, among other things, heat pump properties, thermal characteristics of the building in which it is used, and storage in the form of heated water. To calculate the energy needed for the defrost cycle, the researchers developed a new model to estimate the frost build-up on the outdoor unit.
“The standard model does not take into consideration the relative humidity and the heat exchanger size,” they added. “With the novel suggested numerical model, the humidity and size of the outdoor heat exchanger are taken into consideration, and the results are more dynamic and change according to the temperature and relative humidity.”
To validate the model, the academics then constructed a test rig. Setting up the model with the exact parameters of the rig, they then validated their estimates with the model’s output. They found that the percentage error for total energy consumption was 0.63%, for total heat output 5.2%, and 1.6% for water content after the defrost cycle.
Following the validation, the group input data from 10 cities from around the world into the model. That data included average housing parameters such as area and insulation levels and data for three months from December 1 to February 28.
The selected cities were: Amsterdam (Netherlands); Copenhagen (Denmark); Helsinki (Finland); Stockholm (Sweden); Vancouver (Canada); Ruse (Bulgaria); Moscow (Russia); Reykjavik (Iceland); Harbin (China); and Nottingham (United Kingdom). Vancouver had the lowest number of defrost cycles in the cold season – 56 – while Harbin had the highest – 1,070.
“The results indicate that there is a strong relationship between the number of defrost cycles of heat pumps and the ambient temperature, with a correlation coefficient of – 0.94,” the academics said. “The lower the ambient temperature, the more frost removal operations are done by heat pump.”
“On global level, governments should consider gradual support to renewable energy for a better management of the grid and have a better control on grid demand,” the academics concluded. However, they emphasized that “taking into consideration the climate in the UK, it is highly unlikely the demand of energy would suddenly increase dramatically as the temperature will not likely plummet below freezing, hence defrost cycles will rarely be required by heat pumps.”
They presented the results of the simulation in the study “Investigating the effect of the defrost cycles of air-source heat pumps on their electricity demand in residential buildings,” published in Energy & Buildings.

E.ON Energie Deutschland, a unit of German power utility E.ON, has acquired German PV product distributor Klarsolar for an undisclosed sum.
“By taking over Klarsolar, we are driving forward the expansion of our partner network and will enable our customers to plan solar systems even more easily and digitally in the future,” an E.ON spokesperson told pv magazine.
Klarsolar, founded in 2018, specializes in the digital planning and sales of rooftop PV systems, residential storage systems, and wallboxes. It relies on a Germany-wide network of installers.
E.ON said it expects to achieve “significantly increased installation power throughout Germany,” said Filip Thon, CEO of E.ON Energie Deutschland.
For the co-founders of Klarsolar, Bastian Arend and Dejan Durdic, the sale to E.ON is a way to quickly scale up their business model. E.ON also offers rooftop solutions for commercial customers and is active in the construction of ground-mounted PV systems.

In a first for the leading US electric-vehicle manufacturer, Tesla’s newly released Cybertruck features vehicle-to-load (V2L) and vehicle-to-home (V2H) capabilities.
Although Tesla’s website does not specifically state that the vehicle includes vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, it connects to homes with either a Powerwall or Tesla Gateway. In turn, the Powerwall offers V2G capabilities and virtual power plant participation via Tesla Gateway.
The home backup specifications feature an 11.5 kW max continuous power output at 240 volts, aligning with the company’s upcoming Powerwall 3 and solar inverter, introduced at RE+ in September.
Some additional hardware is required to use the V2H feature. The Universal Wall Connector, likely on many Cybertruck buyers’ wishlists already, is priced at $595. Additionally, the Tesla Gateway, essential for integrating standard Powerwall or solar installations, costs $1,800.
Tesla also recommends the optional Backup Switch, known for streamlining the installation and potentially reducing overall costs. However, the price of this switch varies with different installation requirements and is not uniformly listed. Tesla indicates that existing Powerwall owners won’t need extra hardware to enable the V2H feature.
The vehicle is equipped with five outlets: four standard 120V wall plugs – two in the cabin and two in the cargo bed – and a high-voltage 240 V plug, capable of charging another Tesla.

In n-i-p or “inverted” architecture, the solar cell is illuminated through the electron-transport layer (ETL) side; in the p-i-n structure, it is illuminated through the hole‐transport layer (HTL) surface.
“We demonstrated a new hot-air method for monolithic tandem solar cells and its stabilization through metal ions doping,” the research's lead author, Sawanta S. Mali, told pv magazine, adding that the proposed manufacturing process is free from atomic layer deposition (ALD) and sputtered techniques, which are commonly used for the deposition of a protective interconnecting layer in tandem devices. “Except for thermally evaporated molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) and silver (Ag), all layers were fabricated in ambient air conditions.”
Unlike the conventional antisolvents method, the hot-air technique reportedly facilitates the formation of a highly uniform intermediate complex due to partial evaporation of solvent, thus resulting in a higher perovksite film quality. “We blow a 150 C hot air gun directly over the spinning substrate,” the scientists explained.
The top perovskite cell was built with a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), a mesoscopic electron transfer layer (ETL), the perovskite absorber, a hole transport layer (HTL) based on 3,4,9,10-tetra(n-alkoxy-carbonyl)-perylenes (PTAC), a top donor material known as PBDB-T, a buffer layer made of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
The bottom organic cell was made with a substrate relying on ITO and glass, a window layer of zinc oxide (i-ZnO) and PDI derivative (PDIN), a phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer, a MoO3 buffer layer, and an Ag metal contact.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the champion tandem device built with this architecture achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.07%, an open-circuit voltage of 2.110 V, a short-circuit current density of of 13.65 mAcm-2, and a fill factor of 80.1%.
The device was also able to retain over 90% of the initial efficiency over 600 h at maximum power tracking under continuous illumination.
“Our approach demonstrates solution-processed absorbers with organic cation passivation to reduce open-circuit voltage loss down to 0.025 V, which is the lowest reported to date,” the scientists stated. “This structure also demonstrates the merits of limited recombination, and high reproducibility.”
The novel cell design was introduced in the paper “All-inorganic halide perovskites for air-processed ‘n-i-p' monolithic perovskite/organic hybrid tandem solar cells exceeding 23% efficiency,” published in Energy & Environmental Science.

The CPUC has made another anti-rooftop solar decision, ruling that solar-plus-storage customers cannot export electricity to the grid in exchange for an offset of their utility delivery charges.
Under current billing structures, rooftop solar owners are encouraged to attach batteries so that they can export electricity during times of high demand on the grid. This dispatch of electricity helps reduce the amount of inefficient natural gas “peaker” plants in operation on the grid and smooths supply and demand, leading to stable pricing across the grid. Now, under the new ruling, “delivery” and “generation” charges on utility bills are classified separately, and customers are not allowed to use solar-battery exports to offset “delivery” charges set by the utility.
“While the solar and storage industry adapts to an abrupt shift to net billing, the CPUC has added insult to injury with a series of damaging decisions that completely change the environment for rooftop solar in California,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
California’s once-flourishing rooftop solar market is now reeling from a year of rulemaking decisions by CPUC, which has shown a proclivity to support the interests of its major investor-owned utilities Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas and Electric.
In December 2022, the CPUC transitioned to a net billing format for single-family rooftop solar customers, pushing the state into NEM 3.0. Checks of utility interconnection queues show that requests for new solar array connections have fallen by about 80% since the transition to net billing was made. Nearly 20,000 solar workers have been laid off since the decision was made.
