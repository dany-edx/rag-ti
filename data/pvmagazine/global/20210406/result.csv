Issues with shelf life and cyclability, however, have kept this from developing further into commercial interest.
The first months of 2021 have brought some encouraging developments with aluminum battery technology, with a collaboration between universities in China and the U.S. demonstrating a stable, superfast charging Al battery. And now scientists at Cornell University in the U.S. demonstrate further developments with this technology.
In their paper, Regulating electrodeposition morphology in high-capacity aluminium and zinc battery anodes using interfacial metal–substrate bonding, published in Nature Energy, the group led by Cornell demonstrates a battery with 99.8% reversibility over cycle times of more than 3,600 hours. “A very interesting feature of this battery is that only two elements are used for the anode and the cathode – aluminum and carbon – both of which are inexpensive and environmentally friendly,” said the paper’s lead author Jingxu Zheng. “They also have a very long cycle life.”
By using a three-dimensional rather than a planar architecture for the battery electrodes, the group was able more finely control the layering of aluminum as the battery cycles. “We use a chemical driving force to promote a uniform deposition of aluminum into the pores of the architecture,” Zheng explained. “The electrode is much thicker and it has much faster kinetics.”
The group further noted that aluminum tends to react with the separator that divides the anode and cathode, causing the battery to fail, and incorporated a substrate of interwoven carbon fiber, which forms an even stronger bond with aluminum.
A similar approach could also be applied to other materials, the researchers say, and builds on its earlier work with zinc-based batteries. “Although superficially different from our earlier innovations for stabilizing zinc and lithium metal electrodes in batteries, the principle is the same,” says Cornell Professor of Engineering Lynden Archer. “Design substrates that provide a large thermodynamic driving force that promotes nucleation; and runaway, unsafe growth of the metal electrode is prevented by forces such as surface tension that can be massive at small scales.”

Despite the slowdown and delays to numerous solar projects worldwide, Trina achieved rising revenue of RMB29.4 billion ($4.49 billion) for year-on-year growth of 26%. The net profit attributable to shareholders was RMB1.23 billion ($188 million), up 92% from 2019.
PV module shipments hit 15,915 MW, slightly more than the figure recently posted by domestic rival JA Solar, to lift Trina to number three worldwide, behind Chinese peers Longi and Jinko. Trina has a claim to be the most stable business, in terms of shipment volume, as it has been ranked in the world's top five since 2010.
More than 70% of the company's revenue last year was generated outside China, with the EU accounting for 21% of income, the USA 20% and Japan 4%.
In 2020, Trina launched its large size Vertex PV module series, based on 210mm wafers, with the products pushing typical panel power output to 600 W or more. The company also founded and led an industry alliance of several key PV module manufacturers and related upstream suppliers who will promote 600 W-plus products based on the 210mm wafer instead of smaller conventional alternatives. Trina said global Vertex sales have already reached 10 GW.
The manufacturer said it reached 22 GW of annual module production capacity last year and wants to attain 35 GW of cell capacity this year–with more than 70% of it 210mm-compatible–plus 50 GW of module output. Trina has signed strategic purchase orders with cell, wafer and polysilicon companies to secure its supply chain.
A Trina spokesperson told pv magazine last year's impressive performance was due to “Trina’s continuous technical upgrade[s], popularization of [the] 210mm-based Vertex module, deep internationalization, and [the] support of business partners, which all help … the company achieve sustainable increase[s], even in [the] hard time of 2020.”
pv magazine will hold a webinar on Thursday entitled Concerns and solutions – reliability in large-wafer modules. Registration is available here.

“The project is the result of direct negotiations and is not linked to a specific tender,” a Phanes spokesperson told pv magazine. The plant will sell power to the National Electric Grid of Uzbekistan at an unspecified fixed rate.
The company said the solar park will be linked to a 220/110 kV substation, without providing a timeframe for its construction and completion.
When operational, the plant will be the country's first solar park developed outside of the two tender schemes the government is running with the support of the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), private sector arm of the World Bank.
Uzbekistan is planning to deploy 5 GW of PV by 2030.
According to the latest statistics released by the International Renewable Energy Agency, Uzbekistan had only 4 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2020. Last year, no new PV additions were registered in the country.

The electricity will be provided by a 5 MW offshore floating PV array that Sunseap operates in the Straits of Johor.
“The energy from the 5 MW offshore floating photovoltaic system will be exported to the national grid,” the company said. “All renewable energy credits (RECs) from the project will be transferred to Facebook under the VPPA and will support the tech company's operations in Singapore, including Facebook's first custom–built data center in Asia.”
Singapore’s Economic Development Board supported the project. The array was originally designed to provide power to the grid over a 25-year period. Floating PV is of particular interest in countries such as Singapore, where the availability of land is a major obstacle to the deployment of ground-mounted PV projects.
Last August, a unit of Sembcorp Industries began working on a 60 MW floating solar power plant at the Tengeh Reservoir. The solar facility will provide electricity under a 25-year power purchase agreement with the Public Utilities Board. The Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore has been using the Tengeh Reservoir as a test bed for floating solar since 2017.

A first, new low-voltage device, called Lynx Home U Series, is available in three different devices with storage capacities of 5.4, 10.8, and 16.2 kWh and a weight of 60, 120, and 160kg, respectively. The dimensions of the first unit are 480x175x570mm and those of the second device are 960x175x570mm. The largest battery has a size of 1,440x175x570mm.
The battery has a rated nominal voltage of 51.2 V, uses LiFePO4 as the cathode material, and has a depth of discharge of 90%. The systems feature an ambient operating temperature range of -10 degrees Celsius to 50 degrees Celsius, as well as a 10-year performance guarantee and a five-year product guarantee.
A second, high-voltage battery, dubbed Lynx Home S Series, is available in five versions with storage capacities ranging from 7.68 to 20.48 kWh and a rated voltage of 153.6 to 409.6 V. The smallest device has a weight of 126kg and size of 610x226x1,170mm and the largest weighs 311kg and measures 1,220x226x1,445mm. All the high-voltage batteries are claimed to have a one-hour, ultra-rapid charge rate and have a 10-year performance guarantee. 
Both products come with IP65 protection and can be installed both on a wall or on the ground. They are also said to be able to automatically reboot when the battery enters self-protection mode due to under-voltage.
“Both models of [the] GoodWe Lynx Home Series feature remote diagnosis and upgrade, supporting remote software upgrading of all modules simultaneously,” the manufacturer stated. “The battery also comes with module auto recognition.”
The two battery series are available globally since the beginning of April. The Lynx Home U Series is not sold so far in the US and Japan, and the Lynx Home S Series is not on sale yet in the US, Japan, and Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/06/more-project-sales-ahead-as-defaulting-gcl-awaits-debt-restructure/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",MAX HALL,"APRIL 6, 2021",More project sales ahead as defaulting GCL awaits debt restructure,"Chinese polysilicon maker GCL-Poly will aim to sell off almost 2.8 GW of its remaining solar project capacity this year, to state-owned enterprizes, as it bids to pay down RMB16.5 billion ($2.52 billion) of near-term debts.
Some RMB4.54 billion ($679 million) of that debt pile was due to mature further down the line but has been owing since December 31 after GCL defaulted on the payment of $500 million of senior notes at the start of February, triggering a cross-default.
Setting out the reasons for such problematic accounts, head of the company Zhu Yufeng, in his comments in the 2020 annual report, said: “The global outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus epidemic, international political turmoil and frequent natural disasters have hit hard … global production and economic activities, on the scale of which the world has not witnessed in over a century.”
Such exceptional times saw GCL's New Energy project development business sell off almost 2 GW of solar farms last year, raising RMB6.8 billion in cash and reducing its debts by RMB9.5 billion.
That project sell-off has continued apace since the turn of the year, with state-owned electric company China Three Gorges signing up to pay RMB1.62 billion ($247 million) for ten GCL solar project companies in a deal the vendor hopes to tie up by July, and with a further 34 solar farm subsidiaries the subject of negotiation between the two parties with that transaction planned to be completed this year. Those two sales could generate RMB2.3 billion for GCL and remove another RMB5.5 billion from its books.
With the business hoping to generate RMB1.94 billion in project sales to other third parties this year, GCL expects to have 114 solar projects left, with a total generation capacity of 2.8 GW, going into 2022.
It remains to be seen what effect the long-trailed transformation to an “asset-light” business will have on GCL New Energy, given last year's project sales drove a fall in revenue from the RMB6.05 billion banked in 2019, to RMB4.94 billion. That added up to a loss of RMB1.37 billion last year, after a RMB295 million ($45 million) profit in 2019.
The GCL annual report stressed no demand had been received regarding payment of the RMB4.54 billion it is in cross-default of and a planned reorganization which involves the issue of replacement senior notes for the defaulted investments has been approved by 91.85% of the note holders. GCL hopes to submit the paperwork for the debt restructure to the Court of Bermuda–where the company is registered for tax purposes–this month and expects to rubber-stamp the exercise “by June.”
For now, chairman and president Zhu said, the company “will accelerate the disposal of solar power plant assets and enhance co-operation with central enterprizes and state-owned-enterprizes strategic investors.”
The GCL chief added: “Last year, there were times we felt frustrated and confused, but we never retreated.”
Trade in GCL shares was suspended on Thursday as the company missed the March 31 deadline for publishing the annual accounts. Thursday's report stated GCL expects to resume trading in its stock tomorrow.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/06/cooling-pv-modules-with-radiative-sky-cooling/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FRANCE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 6, 2021",Cooling PV modules with radiative sky cooling,"Scientists have studied radiative sky cooling (RSC) at the research level as a potential passive cooling technique for buildings and solar modules. RSC occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from its environment and less than the energy it radiates. When this happens, the surface loses heat to the outer space and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
Researchers from France's Institut des Nanotechnologies de Lyon (INL) recently started studying the effects of RSC on single-junction solar cells. They aim to determine the ideal thermal emissivity profile of cells that could allow the best cooling. “We also quantified the cooling potential in a broad range of scenarios,” researcher Jérémy Dumoulin told pv magazine.
The scientists explained that PV systems are naturally good candidates for RSC techniques, which use the transparency of the earth’s atmosphere in the 8-micrometer to 13-micrometer range, in order to enhance radiative heat transfer.
“In practice, improving RSC consists in tuning the optical absorption and thermal emission in the infrared range which makes it possible to also reduce the absorption of sub-bandgap photons, referred hereafter as parasitic solar absorption,” they said.
Dumoulin said the technique could be applied in module manufacturing by changing the optical properties of the glass cover. RSC could also be improved to some extent by changing the optical properties of the cells. “We are currently exploring different technical pathways to obtain the desired emissivity while maintaining low cost,” he said.
The academics initially developed a thermal and electrical model to measure cell temperature and yield. They then created a “step model” to establish the cell's emissivity profile. They used this modeling framework to compare the selective and broadband emissivity profiles in different scenarios.
The scientists claim the broadband profile is the ideal choice, as it ensures lower temperatures and higher electrical power output under most environmental conditions, as long as the bandgap is around 2.3 eV. The selective profile is only the most appropriate option in solar cells with a bandgap energy of more than 2.3 eV. Crystalline silicon (C-Si), for example, has a bandgap energy of 1.11 eV and cadmium telluride (CdTe), which is less efficient than C-Si for power generation, has a bandgap of 1.44 eV.
The broadband profile achieved lower module temperatures and a higher power yield for a crystalline silicon cell with a 1.12 eV bandgap, provided that solar illumination surpasses 300 W/mw, and for a perovskite cell with a 1.64 eV, as long as solar illumination exceeds 500 W/m2. “This is valid even if convection is suppressed and under clear sky conditions,” Dumoulin said.
In their simulation, the researchers determined that RSC improvements might lead to a reduction in PV module temperatures of around 10 C. This in turn could raise the performance of the devices by more than 5 W/m2.
“For Si-based devices with high non-radiative recombination, our model predicts an even higher temperature reduction,” the research group said. “Even in the worst scenario – a thick device with initially good thermal management on the front and the rear – a broadband profile can further reduce the temperature by almost 3 C.”
Thus far, they have only simulated their proposed technique, so they can first identify the thermal emissivity profile they need to achieve and its potential benefit. They hope this will justify further research. “We plan to make tests on both cells and modules,” Dumoulin said.
They described the passive cooling technique in “Radiative sky cooling of solar cells: fundamental modeling and cooling potential of single-junction devices,” which was recently published in Sustainable Energy and Fuels.

The result edges out the previous record of 25.2% achieved in February by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and UNIST's earlier result of 25.17% achieved in November 2020.
The cell is based on a type of metal halide perovskite called formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), which is known for its thermal stability and narrow bandgap. The scientists improved the efficiency of the cell by adding formate to the precursor materials, which served to limit the number of defects in the perovskite structure and thus boost its efficiency.
“Here we introduce an anion engineering concept that uses the pseudo-halide anion formate (HCOO−) to suppress anion-vacancy defects that are present at grain boundaries and at the surface of the perovskite films and to augment the crystallinity of the films,” the Korean-Swiss group explained, noting that the new material is able to interact with the surrounding elements.
Anion-vacancy is a material defect that occurs when a negative ion is ‘missing' from the lattice structure of the material, leaving behind a ‘hole', which is then occupied by an electron to maintain electric balance. When this defect occurs, electrons can remain trapped. “We broke the stereotype that only iodine or bromine ions can be used for negative ions,” researcher Kim Jin-young stated.
“The resulting solar cell devices attain a power conversion efficiency of 25.6% (certified 25.2%), have long-term operational stability (450 hours) and show intense electroluminescence with external quantum efficiencies of more than 10%,” the scientists stated, adding that the 25.2% efficiency was certified by the Newport PV Lab in Montana in the U.S.
The solar cell was described in the paper Pseudo-halide anion engineering for α-FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells, published in nature.

A company with a mission to mitigate the harsh effects of the sun and improve the energy efficiency of buildings will soon make the excess electricity generated by its commercial rooftop solar system available at a discount to employees. This new perk of working at the Sydney factory of Hunter Douglas, a supplier of blinds and window awnings, is believed to be an Australian first in terms of direct renewable energy trading between a company and its workers.
In mid-2018, the large roof of the company's main Australian warehouse was blanketed with 800 kW of solar panels, as part of its commitment to sustainability.
“Everything we do is designed to grow our business and our customers’ business and contribute to a more sustainable world,” says the Hunter Douglas website.
The company’s advanced window treatments, using innovative materials and often automated systems, have long been designed to reduce energy losses in homes and offices. The installation of 2,080 solar panels on its Rydalmere factory was intended, it says, “to support the local economy, continuing our investment in Australian manufacturing.”
Over time, Hunter Douglas recognized that it could also benefit its employees by offering a reduced rate on excess energy it was exporting to the grid on weekends and on summer evenings after 4pm, when the facility is closed.
The sharing concept was realized using the energy traceability platform developed by technology innovator Enosi, and a new contract for energy supply offered by Simply Energy, the Australian retail arm of French energy giant Engie.
Enosi’s Powertracer allows energy consumers to choose the source of their energy – whether it be one or more solar or wind farms, or in this case, a rooftop solar installation. Using smart metering data, it traces, matches and settles energy production and consumption at half-hour intervals, so consumers can see exactly where their energy is coming from at any given time, and how much they’re saving by dealing direct.
To take advantage of the discount offered by Hunter Douglas, employees must have a smart meter, and be willing to sign up for electricity supply with Simply Energy. Hunter Douglas gets the same return on the power as it would from selling it to the grid. For employees who perhaps can’t afford to install solar on their own roofs, or who live in rented homes, it means they can source a good proportion of their energy from renewable generation, at some of the lowest energy prices available in New South Wales.
Enosi’s system “gives consumers power” over their choice of energy provider, Vincent Dwyer, principal of energy estate, told pv magazine Australia last year. At the same time, it allows businesses such as Hunter Douglas to create a sense of community among their employees by spreading the benefits of their investment in solar.
Through energy retailers such as Simply Energy and Energy Locals partnership with Powertracer, Enosi believes households and businesses can today source 70% of their energy directly from renewables. Over time, it says, “we will introduce more and more wind and solar” generators to the platform, and probably also partner  with battery energy storage providers to ultimately provide 100% clean energy matching at a lower cost than is available through the grid.

Tata Power Delhi Distribution, in collaboration with Nexcharge, has launched India’s first grid-connected community energy storage system (CESS) at Rani Bagh in New Delhi. Nexcharge is a joint venture between Exide Industries, India’s largest lead-acid storage battery manufacturer, and Leclanché, a leading lithium-ion battery manufacturer in Switzerland.
The 150 kW/528 kWh battery energy storage system at Tata’s Ranibagh Substation benefits both customers and the utility. Rani Bagh was selected for the installation and the setup will help to provide continuous and reliable power to key consumers.
The key feature of the CESS is to support the distribution transformers in managing peak load, voltage regulation, power factor improvement, frequency regulation, and the deviation settlement mechanism. During outages, the battery will provide 150 kW for four hours to consumers.
The battery energy storage system will charge during off-peak hours and discharge the power during peak conditions, which will enhance the asset’s life.
