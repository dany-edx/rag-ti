France's energy regulator, the Commission de Régulation de l'Énergie (CRE), has published the feed-in tariffs for rooftop PV installations not exceeding 500 kW in size for the first quarter of 2022.
Usually, the tariff levels are lowered quarter by quarter according to the new capacity for which connection requests were received in the previous three-month period. This quarter, however, the tariffs remained unchanged despite strong development in the second half of last year.
Different tariffs are applied depending on the project size and location, which can be either on the French mainland, Corsica or in the nation's overseas territories.

A recent decree introduced by the government modified the criteria for the application of the tariffs, French solar association Enerplan noted. The latest rates apply for mainland France from February 1 to April 30. The tariffs for France's non-interconnected territories apply from January 1 to March 31.
There are currently no tariffs for ground-mounted projects of less than 500 kWp, but French energy minister Barbara Pompili recently announced that she intends to include such installations located on degraded land. Enerplan will work with the ministry on this with the aim of implementation in 2022.
The French government raised the size limit for PV projects that can qualify for fixed tariffs from 100 kW to 500 kW in October. At the time, in order to boost development in the rooftop segment, the government also decided to reduce the degression rates planned for the feed-in tariffs.

The project is part of the I'mnovation program, which Acciona Energy launched to assess emerging energy storage solutions through collaborations with companies from around the world.
Ten energy storage companies participated in the program and four were selected to test their technologies at Acciona's facilities, including Gelion. The selected startups will have the opportunity to test their technologies for a period of between six months and one year at the 1.2 MW Montes del Cierzo experimental photovoltaic plant in Tudela, Navarra, starting in July 2022.
If the tests with Acciona Energía are successful, Gelion's Endure battery will form part of the European company's supplier portfolio as a renewable energy storage provider.
Gelion has developed a battery technology for the stationary storage of renewable energy based on non-fluid zinc bromide chemistry that can be manufactured in existing lead-acid battery factories.
Gelion emerged from the University of Sydney in 2015 to commercialize the battery technology developed by Professor Thomas Maschmeyer, recipient of the Australian Prime Minister's Award for Innovation in 2020. The company went public on the London AIM market last year.
Maschmeyer describes zinc-bromide chemistry as ideal for solar batteries as it’s relatively slow to charge. He’s glad other companies are playing in the space, positioning lithium as the real competition, over which he says Gelion’s technology has significant advantages, particularly with regards to safety. Its electrolyte gel is a fire retardant, meaning its batteries can’t catch fire or explode.

The goal is to develop a hydrogen fuel cell that runs on a liquid organic hydrogen carrier, the so-called LOHC (Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier). “The direct use of LOHC in fuel cells for power generation eliminates the need to handle hydrogen as a gas and allows a particularly cheap and safe supply for mobile and stationary energy consumers,” commented Daniel Teichmann, CEO of Hydrogenious. In Hydrogenious' proprietary process, benzyltoluene is used as the LOHC. “This is an oil-like organic substance that chemically binds the hydrogen and allows it to be transported under normal ambient conditions. Unlike the classical design, there would be no molecular hydrogen in a LOHC fuel cell or in the supply chain. The liquid carrier material can be used multiple times, making it particularly sustainable,” Schaeffler wrote on Friday. Together with the Helmholtz Institute Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schaeffler is developing the corresponding fuel cell technology for the direct use of hydrogen bound in LOHC. For this purpose, adaptations have to be made in the design of the fuel cells, said Schaeffler.
Australia’s alternatively powered automotive company H2X Global has formed a joint venture with Indian automotive components manufacturer Advik Hi-Tech to manufacture hydrogen fuel cells, generators and vehicles. Pure Hydrogen is the largest shareholder of H2X. The first fuel cell Generators manufactured by the joint venture will be used in a large-scale power system in Pune, India. “H2X chief executive officer Brendan Norman believes the Indian market is critical to the long-term success of the hydrogen industry and that the partnership with Advik will be equally critical to the company’s growth,” the company wrote on Monday. Australian media outlet Stockhead noted that Pure Hydrogen also signed a binding five-year term sheet with specialist vehicle distributor BLK Auto.
British chemicals company Ineos invited major engineering design contractors to tender for the next stage of the design of a carbon capture enabled hydrogen production plant and major associated infrastructure at Grangemouth. “This will see the displacement of hydrocarbon fuels used at Grangemouth, like natural gas, with clean, low carbon hydrogen to power our processes,” commented Stuart Collings, CEO Ineos O&P UK. Blue hydrogen will fuel the existing Combined Heat and Power Plant, the KG Ethylene Plant and assets in the Petroineos Refinery. “This will require a new hydrogen distribution network throughout the site and modifications to the existing fuel gas network, all of which are captured within the scope of the engineering design,” the company wrote last week. Meanwhile, the UK is resorting to diplomacy and stronger ties with potential producers. For instance, a new research project announced by the United Arab Emirates government will explore potential green hydrogen collaborations between the UAE and the UK. The UK also launched on Monday its Hydrogen Policy Commission, which will advise politicians on how to support green and blue hydrogen in the country. The Hydrogen Policy Commission should publish its first assessment later this year.
The European Commission has adopted an amendment of the energy statistics regulation. The amendment, which will enter into force in February, will provide statistics to monitor several policy initiatives to decarbonize the European economy, including the Energy Union and the Fit-for-55 package, as well as the Hydrogen Strategy and the Initiative on Batteries. The new statistics will be first available for the year 2022. “These new statistics will differentiate green hydrogen (produced from renewable energy) from hydrogen produced from oil or gas, and will include data to monitor how hydrogen is used in our economy,” Eurostat wrote last week. The European Commission is also supporting member states in their hydrogen plans through several support schemes. Last week, for instance, Italy asked regions to express their interest for the construction of green hydrogen production sites on brownfield sites, which will be funded under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (EU funds).
Patriot Hydrogen executed an oversubscribed A$1 million capital raise, the Melbourne-based renewables company announced Monday. The company is expected to install its first modular hydrogen production unit in mid-2022 at Kimberley Clean Energy’s Kilto Station project near Broome, Western Australia. The A$ 1 million in funds will also underpin Patriot’s planned initial public offering in the third quarter of 2022 and also fund the delivery of more Patriot modules to Kimberley Clean Energy, which signed a memorandum of understanding for 75 units, the company said.
Australia’s Aviation H2 is seeking to raise initial capital of $300,000 to fund the planning study for the development of a hydrogen jet engine plane. “Once their initial testing is complete in March 2022, the team will present their recommendation on the most commercially viable model to begin constructing a prototype. The lead engineer and company director, Dr Helmut Mayer, believes they will have their first plane in the sky in the next 18 months,” Aviation H2 wrote on Sunday.
French transport tech company Gaussin announced last week that its racing team has completed the Dakar 2022 with its H2 Racing Truck, a hydrogen-powered truck sponsored by Saudi energy company Aramco. The truck started the race in early January. “We even exceeded some of our expectations, with a demonstrated range of 400 km, whereas our conservative estimate was for a range of around 250 km,” commented CEO Christophe Gaussin.

Working with Evergy, a utility serving customers in Kansas and Missouri, the Kansas Geological Survey is studying the possibility of storing excess energy generated by coal-fired power plants in underground salt caverns for future use.
“Excess electricity can be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gas,” said Franek Hasiuk, KGS geologist and principal investigator for the project. “The hydrogen can then be stored in salt caverns for later use, either by burning it with natural gas in the power plant, adding it into pipeline natural gas for burning in home furnaces and stoves, supplying it to another business for use in chemical processes like fertilizer production, or using it to power vehicles.”
As electrical grid operators increasingly buy power first from wind, solar and nuclear operations and turn to natural gas and coal plants only when needed, there’s a growing need for storage of energy for future use.
“Hydrogen storage could allow Evergy to store large amounts of energy to deal with the problem of intermittent power production from renewables – no solar when it’s night, no wind power when it’s not windy,” Hasiuk said.
Extensive salt beds lie under the surface in Kansas. The Hutchinson Salt Member, deposited during the Permian Period, covers about 37,000 square miles in the subsurface in central and south-central Kansas and reaches a maximum thickness of more than 500 feet. Thick salt layers also occur in western and southwestern Kansas.
Salt has been mined in Kansas since the late 1800s. Caverns in the salt beds are used for storing natural gas, natural gas liquids and other hydrocarbons.
The study, supported by a $200,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, will study the economic risks and benefits of storing hydrogen in these underground salt caverns.
“Right now, it’s unclear whether undertaking a project like this is feasible for energy companies,” Hasiuk said. “Our study will help reduce the uncertainties related to hydrogen storage. At the end of the study, we may find out the costs of underground storage are as risky as or more risky than thought, but we should certainly be more confident about just how risky it is.”
If the one-year project successfully demonstrates the viability of hydrogen storage, the partners will move to a second phase consisting of more advanced engineering and design of a storage system.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/01/bloombergnef-says-global-solar-will-cross-200-gw-mark-for-first-time-this-year-expects-lower-panel-prices/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"FEBRUARY 1, 2022","BloombergNEF says global solar will cross 200 GW mark for first time this year, expects lower panel prices","In 2021, photovoltaic systems with a combined capacity of 183 GW were installed worldwide — almost 40 GW more than in 2020, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (NEF) reports.
As a result of this strong growth, the analyst has revised upwards its outlook for 2022, expecting new systems may total between 204 and 252 GW. Considering any possible scenario, the mark of 200 GW should be broken through for the first time this year.
China will drive demand and rooftop PV will be the fastest-growing segment. Record growth of 20 GW will be achieved by residential installations. Commercial and industrial systems will also see their share increase, as these are becoming more and more profitable against the background of rising electricity prices and electricity shortages in the country. Overall, the BloombergNEF analysts are expecting an increase in new capacity of between 81 and 92 GW this year in China.
The analyst also expects current high module prices will drop soon. In 2021, polysilicon shortage drove the prices for 166 mm monocrystalline solar modules up to $0.278 per watt. For this year, polysilicon production will increase by 39% as new manufacturing facilities are coming online in China. The price of polysilicon has been falling again since October – from $37 to $32 per kg by the end of the year. This trend will continue and prices of between $20 and $25 per kg can be expected in the second half of the year. Increasing efficiency in the production of large wafers with a size of 210 mm will further contribute to further reducing module prices. For the second half of the year, BNEF predicts that the module price will be between 11 and 15% lower, reaching $23/24 per Watt.
Overall, BNEF assumes that production capacities will increase along the entire photovoltaic value chain. New cell factories with an annual capacity of more than 10 GW for TOPCon and heterojunction products are currently being built. Furthermore, the analyst revealed that annual production capacity for PERC solar cells was more than 400 GW at the end of the year.
New production capacities for solar cells and solar modules are also increasing outside of China. This is particularly evident in India, the US and Europe. However, the new production lines are emerging rather slowly and the BNEF analysts do not assume that there will be a sharp increase in the amount of products manufactured outside of China this year. Manufacturers in India, the US and Europe must be aware that they are expanding into an oversupply market where there is guaranteed demand for their photovoltaic products at premium prices, the analysts said.
Growing storage market
BloombergNEF also expects the number of solar-plus-storage power plants to double this year. According to the BNEF database, a total of 278 of these power plants with a combined storage capacity of 7.7 GW is currently operational, with China and the US leading the way.
The demand for rooftop solar arrays combined with residential storage systems is increasingly on the political agenda in many countries and is becoming increasingly important as a sector, the analyst continues. In the US state of Hawaii, for example, almost every new residential PV system is combined with a battery. In Germany, the rate is around 50% and in Switzerland around 5%. BNEF expects at least two more countries to surpass the 50% mark in new installations by the end of the year.
In Europe, Bloomberg analysts expect a significant increase in the number of power purchase agreements (PPAs) concluded for photovoltaic systems. They name Poland, Denmark and Germany as countries in which such agreements will increasingly be sealed this year. This is also to be expected in Spain once the political uncertainties have been resolved.

The latest such move has seen U.S.-based start-up Sparkz announce a pilot plant in Livermore, northern California, where it plans to begin construction of a pilot manufacturing facility for its patented solid-state battery technology.
The company’s move to establish its first pilot production was spurred by support from the California Energy Commission (CEC). Last year, Sparkz won a $2.6 million grant from the CEC to extend its development into solid-state batteries as the company takes steps to shift its second product line from development to commercialization.
“The California Energy Commission’s funding and continued support of Sparkz was an important step towards securing this facility,” said Sparkz CEO Sanjiv Malhotra. “The CEC understands that to challenge China’s domination of next-gen battery production, and reach America’s clean energy potential, we need to build sustainable battery facilities in the U.S. Sparkz is quickly approaching this goal and putting Americans to work.”
Founded in late 2019, Sparkz has recently completed the transfer of six patents from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which continues to be the company's R&D partner.
Sparks' lithium-ion batteries are said to offer double the energy density compared to other zero cobalt chemistries, that is lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries that are predominantly made in China. Its initial research shows the ability to reduce the cost of cell manufacturing by about 40%, while maintaining energy density and lifecycles comparable to chemistries that utilize cobalt.
Sparks' high-density lithium battery design uses novel cathode and anode compositions, including early transition metal-stabilized high capacity oxidatively stable cathodes. This innovation improves on lithium-ion cathodes by replacing early transition metals, namely cobalt, at relevant sites in cathodes, and by varying the lithium composition.
Its other licensed technologies include a nonaqueous electrolyte with lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide salt for fast charging/discharging of lithium-ion batteries, which enables the batteries to perform at a 23% higher capacity during a 12-minute charge than other formulas; as well as a scaling process which enables industrial-scale production of battery materials through a series of chemical processes.
Sparkz also operates an R&D and innovation center in Knoxville, Tennessee, and is also exploring new plants in the Appalachia to begin manufacturing its batteries for OEM partners. The company has the exclusive licenses to produce zero cobalt, lithium batteries and is committed to producing them in the U.S.

Through the procurement exercise, the country's authorities want to contract 1,260 MW of PV, 380 MW of wind power, 230 MW of biomass, and 130 MW of hydropower capacity.
As for the PV technology, around 900 MW should be assigned to the Luzon province, while the provinces of Visayas and Mindanao are expected to be awarded 260 and 100 MW, respectively.
The Philippines has an installed power generation capacity of around 20 GW, with 14.3 GW of it in the Luzon area, where the largest of the country’s three grids is located. The next two largest networks are in Visayas and Mindanao.
The Philippines government announced the plan to introduce the Green Energy Tariff Program auction in February 2020.
The auction will feature a maximum price for the renewable electricity generated by tendered projects and the program will be administered by the Philippines Department of Energy, according to a report published by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). Off-grid electrification projects will be included in the proposed tender system, the research institute added.
The country plans to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030. Recent statistics released by the International Renewable Energy Agency show that the Philippines had an installed PV capacity of 1.04GW – driven by the country's renewable energy law – at the end of 2020. Most of the nation’s solar facilities were secured under the old feed-in tariff regime, auctions, and net metering programs.

Maxeon Solar Technologies announced an expanded push in the US commercial and industrial (C&I) solar market, entering an agreement with performance and protection plan provider Omnidian. The company will sell its integrated back contact (IBC) solar panels with an attached performance assurance product from Omnidian. The move builds on Maxeon’s current presence in the US as a utility-scale solar developer.
The IBC solar cells feature back contact energy conversion, allowing the entire front of the cell to absorb sunlight without any shading from metal ribbons like the ones found PERC cells.
Seattle-based Omnidian said it will bundle one year of its Shield plan for commercial systems larger than 250 kW sold by Maxeon, with the option to extend coverage for multiple years. The partnership is expected to facilitate access for Maxeon to reach Omnidian’s C&I customers.
“With responsibility for the oversight of over 1,800 Megawatts of U.S. solar capacity, Omnidian is a formidable and pioneering force in the industry and has gained extensive expertise in protecting and accelerating investments in clean energy,” said Jeff Waters, CEO of Maxeon Solar Technologies.
The Omnidian Shield plan includes system protection, preventative maintenance, covered corrective maintenance, monitoring, and a 95% forecasted energy cash-back guarantee. The support included 24/7 monitoring, intelligent system diagnostics, and real-time symptom detection. The company said its cash-back guarantee shifts risks away from the solar asset owners and helps address uncertainty with weather.
Omnidian CEO Mark Liffman hailed Maxeon’s product reliability upon the partnership. “An in-depth analysis of the degradation of Maxeon IBC panels revealed a significantly lower rate of degradation relative to other manufacturers enabling us to offer plans with lower degradation under this partnership,” he said.
Headquartered in Singapore, Maxeon designs and manufactures both Maxeon and SunPower brand solar panels, with operations in over 100 countries. In November, the company’s chief revenue officer Mark Babcock joined pv magazine to announce the launch of its pencil-thin adhesive back contact Air panels in Europe. The lightweight panels are designed for the large number of low-load commercial and industrial roofs on older buildings throughout western Europe.
Babcock also said the company was mulling a potential US cell manufacturing facility, but the company is waiting on a handful of policy changes first. He said a 3 GW cell fab would depend on the approval of a US Department of Energy loan, the passing of Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, and the possible passing of the climate portion of the Biden administration’s Build Back Better Act. Pending these conditions, Maxeon said it may begin producing cells in the US as soon as 2023.

In December, TransAlta had published an environmental evaluation, an environmental protection plan, and a noise impact assessment on the project, and the three documents were now added to the approval proceedings. The reports are intended to bring clarity to issues such as the risk of battery fires, the risk of leaching or leaking from the batteries, noise concerns, and the environmental impact of the construction of power lines.
“Our initial assessment indicates that no additional power lines are needed and the connection for the facility would be limited to modifications within the existing substation,” the company said in a recent statement to its stakeholders. “However, given TransAlta is not a transmission facility owner in this area, we are currently working with the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) to identify, study, and verify feasible transmission voltage connection options to connect WaterCharger to the Alberta Interconnected Electric System at, or adjacent to, the Ghost substation.”
In the environmental evaluation, the company specified it wants to use lithium-ion batteries and that a battery sub-chemistry of lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) is currently being considered. ” The project will consider various technical factors when selecting the final battery vendor, including safety, life span, performance, and cost,” the document reads. “The size and number of modular battery units is expected to vary by vendor, with the project expecting up to 220 units to be installed. The final layout and number of battery units will be confirmed once the battery manufacturer is selected.”
The storage system will include bi-directional inverters, protection equipment, direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) circuit breakers, waveform filter equipment, equipment terminals, and a connection cabling system. The modular battery units are each expected to measure 7 x 2 x 2 m and to embed a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system.
TransAlta plans to start construction on the storage facility in March 2023 and to complete it within nine months. The batteries will be remotely operated by TransAlta’s Hydro Control Centre located in Calgary, approximately 50 km east of the hydropower dam, over their 25-year lifecycle.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/01/multi-level-fin-heat-sinks-for-solar-module-cooling/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MALAYSIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 1, 2022",Multi-level fin heat sinks for solar module cooling,"Scientists from the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI) at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia have developed a passive cooling technique for photovoltaic modules based on the use of multi-level aluminum fin heat sinks (MLFHS) applied on the rear side of the panels.
“The novel fins were designed based on the temperature behavior of all types of crystalline modules,” the research's corresponding author, Adnan Ibrahim, told pv magazine. “So, they can be used for either monocrystalline and polycrystalline panels.”
The heat sinks were built with the commercially available aluminum alloy 6063 and were attached using epoxy resin with metal powder to the rear side of a 120 W monocrystalline panel. The use of epoxy is claimed to eliminate air gaps and improve thermal conductivity between the cooling system and the module and the proposed heat sink design is described by the researchers as able to reduce the stagnation zone within the heat sinks by inducing more air turbulence and better heat transfer.
The system has a dual fins height of 40 to 60 mm and the fins were L-shaped to offer a better heat dissipation rate per unit mass compared with the conventional heat sink.”The novelty of the proposed fins aims to improve the temperature non-uniformity by flattening the PV temperature curves,” they also explained.

This system configuration was tested on south-oriented 120 W monocrystalline PV modules installed with a tilt angle of 18 degrees and its performance was compared with that of a reference identical panel without the cooling system. “Since Malaysia is located near the equator, the climate is categorized as equatorial, hot, humid, and cloudy throughout the year,” the researchers specified. “The recorded temperatures were high and stable between 29 °C to 38 °C throughout the day, even when the solar irradiance dropped below 600 W/m2.”
Their measurements showed that the reference module without the cooling system reached an average temperature of 64.2 degrees while that with the cooling tech reached 56.1 degrees Celsius, which means the proposed system was found able to reduce the module operating temperature by up to 8.45 degrees Celsius.  The scientists warned, however, that this result may be achieved in hot weather countries that receive more than 600 W/m2 of solar irradiance, while the technology may not be economically viable for countries with average solar irradiance below 500 W/m2. “We estimated the cost of the MLFHS at $0.60/W,” Ibrahim told pv magazine.
All the details of the technique can be found in the paper “Outdoor performance evaluation of a novel photovoltaic heat sinks to enhance power conversion efficiency and temperature uniformity,” which was recently published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering.
“The maximum electrical power output increases up to 10.75% by integrating the proposed MLFHS at the backside of the PV module,” the paper reads. “The proposed new fin heat sink design is a viable solution and economical to achieve temperature uniformity as the hotspot phenomenon can lead to mechanical damage and reduce its lifespan.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/01/us-microgrid-project-using-vanadium-redox-flow-battery/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 1, 2022",US microgrid project using vanadium redox flow battery,"San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) and Sumitomo Electric (SEI) completed a zero-emissions microgrid pilot project using a vanadium redox flow (VRF) battery.
Microgrids, mini power grids that can operate independently of the larger grid and keep critical facilities powered during emergencies and power shut downs, are becoming more important in states like California that have seen a dramatic increase in wildfires, critical weather events, and other causes. Just last week about 6,000 SDG&E customers were without power due to unknown causes.
The 5-year demonstration project is located in the Bonita community in south San Diego County. The 2MW VRF battery at the heart of the demonstration project can store 8MW hours of energy,  potentially enough to power the equivalent of about 1,000 homes for up to four hours. In one of the test runs the 2MW/8MWh VRF battery powered 66 residential and commercial customers for close to five hours.
“Climate conditions increasingly threaten the continuity of essential services that our customers expect and deserve from us, which is one of the many reasons we are so focused on innovation and technology,” said SDG&E CEO Caroline Winn. “There is a critical need to develop breakthrough solutions like zero-emissions microgrids to not only minimize disruptions, but to also support the transition to a cleaner, safer and more reliable energy grid of the future.”
Different from more prevalent stacked lithium-ion battery cells, VRF batteries consist of tanks of liquid electrolytes and pumps that charge and discharge electrons to the grid. According to the U.S. Energy Department, VRF technology has several upsides including the potential to store MWh of power in simple designs, the ability to discharge power for up to 12 hours at a time, and the fact that VRF batteries do not present a fire hazard and use no highly reactive or toxic substances, can sit idle for long periods of time without losing storage capacity, and more.
Downsides include the fact that VRBs generally have lower energy densities than other battery types (although increased energy density would help reduce costs and broaden applications), the standby current drain can lead to power loss, the technology’s small operating temperature window requires the use of air conditioning systems that can result in significant energy losses, and the cost of the vanadium electrolyte.
During the pilot, the batteries charged when solar energy was abundant and discharged during peak hours to meet demand.
The microgrid demonstration project was completed late last year and included two successful tests. One was a seamless transition in which customers did not experience any loss of power when they were transitioned to the microgrid for electric service. The other was a black start, where microgrid operators established and sustained service after a complete loss of power. Customers experienced a momentary outage before they were transitioned to the microgrid, which operated in island mode separate from the power grid. The microgrid provided energy service as expected, even on a cloudy day when solar power output was not optimal.
SDG&E began operating the first utility-scale microgrid in America in 2013 in Borrego Springs and is currently in the process of upgrading it to run on 100% renewable energy. The utility is building four additional microgrids and is on track to integrate about 145MW of utility-owned energy storage with the local grid in 2022.
