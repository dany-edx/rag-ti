Spain's Endesa, via its Enel Green Power España unit, has been selected as the provisional preferred bidder of the so-called Andorra-Comarcas Mineras (Teruel) Fair Transition tender. It is poised to develop 1.3 GW of grid capacity left available by a decommissioned thermal power plant, which was operated by Endesa itself.
The aim of granting the grid access capacity is to facilitate the deployment of renewable energy and promote the economic and social recovery of the zones. Endesa said it obtained the right to connect 953 MW and the option to reach 1.2 GW.
Endesa plans to invest more than €1.2 billion ($1.17 billion) in the project, which will involve the construction of five solar and five wind plants in a hybridization scheme supported by a battery storage system. Additionally, it will deploy an electrolyzer allowing the management of surpluses for the production of green hydrogen.

Germany-based Skeleton Technologies has won a major customer for its SuperBattery. Energy giant Shell wants to use it across the board for its plans to electrify and decarbonize its mining operations. Skeleton will become a member of a consortium led by Shell to implement this plan.
Skeleton's SuperBattery is based on its patented curved graphene material. It combines the properties of supercapacitors and batteries in one solution.
The German company developed the technology for the specific requirements of different sectors. It is currently testing it in hybrid and fuel cell electric vehicles, buses, trucks, and charging infrastructure.
Shell is pursuing the goal of effectively reducing its carbon emissions using renewable energy and electrification.
“Mining is one of those sectors where decarbonization is particularly complex,” said Grischa Sauerberg, VP of mining, sectors and decarbonization at Shell.
A transformation requires high performance and cost efficiency in equal measure, said Sauerberg.
“We see immense potential in the 1-minute charge time and 30-minute mileage for decarbonizing other heavy-duty segments besides mining,” Sauerberg added. “The energy storage system can run up to 50,000 cycles,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine.
Skeleton says its charging soluion is 100 times faster than traditional lithium-ion batteries. Off-road vehicles can be charged in less than a minute to have a range for another hour, it claims. The SuperBattery also has an energy density of 65 W/h per kg. In addition, the storage system is free of critical raw materials such as cobalt, copper, nickel and graphite, which increases safety.
“Over the next seven years, the mining sector represents one of the largest markets for us, with a revenue opportunity of around EUR 95 billion,” added Taavi Madiberk, the CEO of Skeleton Technologies. “This is not only due to decarbonization, but also to the tangible economic benefits for users of our solutions.”
Skeleton Technologies plans to start mass production of its SuperBattery in 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/12/pv-water-draining-device-with-new-anti-clogging-design/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,GERMANY,PORTUGAL,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 12, 2022",PV water-draining device with new anti-clogging design,"Portuguese startup Solarud has launched a new version of its water-draining device. The new model can be clipped to solar modules to resolve dust and soiling issues.
After the launch of the original device in May, the company listened to customer feedback to develop anti-clogging technology.
“In extreme environments like deserts or arid environments with low humidity, once the first rainfalls fell, or during early morning condensation, the device would get clogged,” António Neves, the co-founder of Solarud, told pv magazine.
Accumulated soiling can lead to clogging in residential installations, with the devices requiring cleaning after a few months.
The company's Solarud Nextgen solution features the company’s patented anti-clogging design to address this issue. It claims energy gains of 3.5% on average with the original device, and expects even better results with the Nextgen, although it has yet to start testing the design.
The product is also more adaptable to different module sizes than its predecessor. The original device worked with frame heights of 30 mm, 35 mm, and 40 mm.
“The new device can adapt to any measure between 30 mm and 40 mm. The tabs are no longer broken [to adapt to the intended measure] but are rather folded. This folding gives them a spring effect, thereby adapting to different heights,” said Neves.
The new device can thus adapt to frame heights of 32 mm and 38 mm, which are standard in the industry. The company has switched from industrial 3D printing to using injection molding for the Nextgen. The switch has “increased the production factor by almost 20 times, and has also allowed for creating more robust devices,” said Neves.
It is offering a six-year warranty for the Nextgen – a four-year improvement on its predecessor. The new device is also cheaper, and is available for bulk purchases, starting at 50 units for €99.50 ($96.61), or €1.99 per piece, plus VAT and shipping costs. The original device is no longer manufactured or available for purchase.
The company has also launched nano and custom-made versions of the device, both featuring the anticlog design. The Solarud Nano, with a base of less than 10 mm, compared to the Nextgen’s 22 mm, is designed for installations with very small gaps between modules, up to 10 mm.
The Nextgen and the Nano devices can only be adapted to frames with thicknesses between 8 mm and 11 mm, but the Solarud Custom can be made to measure.
“We have been asked for devices with 13 mm and 15 mm thickness, especially from costumers in Australia, so we decided to create a service of custom-made devices,” explained Neves. “The clients send us the modules’ datasheet, we design the device to fit the specifications, send the costumers some samples, and if they are satisfied, they can then order the devices on our website.”
Both the nano and custom devices are 3D printed and are available for bulk purchases starting at €2.49 per unit, plus VAT and shipping costs. The company develops and produces all the devices in Portugal and has an international client base focused in Europe and Germany, in particular.

It is believed that all major Chinese polysilicon suppliers have arranged talks with the government, due the rise of polysilicon since 2020 to more than CNY 300 ($41.85)/kg.  “Some companies whooped up polysilicon prices and stored products for better deals, and these also contributed to the price rise,” the agencies said. The three departments urged PV companies to regulate their sales activities and stop stockpiling products.
Datang Group has announced the results for its fourth centralized purchasing order for the fourth quarter of 2022. A 5.55 GW PV module order was shared by six module suppliers, including JinkoSolar, Longi, Da-Solar, CSI, Risen, and Tongwei. The bid was divided into two parts. The first part was for n-type modules with capacities of 780 MW, and the second part consisted of 4,773 MW of p-type products. Jinko and Da-Solar together won the first part of the exercise, according to Datang.
Tongwei has announced its preliminary financial results for the first three quarters of this year. The polysilicon supplier and solar cell manufacturer said its net profit attributable to shareholders rose between 259.98% and 266.71% year on year to between CNY 21.4 billion and CNY 21.8 billion. It said rising market demand and higher polysilicon prices contributed to its performance.

The long-awaited initiative is designed to scale up manufacturing of innovative PV products and components, in order to drive solar deployment across the continent.
The alliance is expected to help the EU to surpass 320 GW of newly installed solar capacity by 2025, and almost 60 GW by 2030, which will pave the way for Europe’s energy independence.
“The alliance will foster an innovative and value-creating industry in Europe, which leads to job creation here. Europe's solar industry already created more than 357,000 jobs,” said EC Commissioner Thierry Breton. “We have the potential to double these figures by the end of the decade.”
The European Commission is now set to publish a call for membership in the alliance by November. The initiative is expected to launch by the end of this year.
Once it is set up, the alliance will bring together industrial actors, research institutes, consumer associations, and NGOs to deliver an action plan for the solar industrial value chain in Europe. It will also engage with the EU and its member states on issues such as technology, supply chain, raw materials, and access to finance.
The European Commission will work with EIT InnoEnergy to set up the alliance on the foundations of the European Solar Initiative, which was established in 2020 by SolarPower Europe and EIT InnoEnergy to expand solar PV manufacturing.
“SolarPower Europe is pleased to support the new EU Solar PV Industry Alliance, both through our years of groundwork through the European Solar Initiative, and via our incoming role on the Steering Committee within the Alliance,” said Dries Acke, the policy director for the lobbying group. “We look forward to continuing our work through this new Initiative, and re-shoring European solar manufacturing for good.”

“The new module will be produced at our 1,500 MW factory in China were we recently upgraded our production lines,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The modules have a glass-glass bill of materials with polyolefin elastomer (POE) as encapsulation material. This makes the module highly durable and perfect not only for moderate climates but also for extreme climates such as deserts or tropical areas. The modules show relatively higher durability against wind and snow compared to typical single-glass modules.”
The largest module series includes five panel versions with power outputs of 555 W to 575 W and power conversion efficiency ranging from 21.50% to 22.28%. The open-circuit voltage is between 50.07 V and 50.68 V and the short-circuit current is between 14.07 A and 14.31 A. The modules have a see 2,278 mm x 1,133 mm x 35 mm and weigh in at 33 kg.
The mid-size series consists of five products with wattage spanning from 460 W to 480 W and efficiency comprised between 21.26% and 22.18%. The open-circuit voltage is between 42.05 V and 42.71 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.99 A and 14.33 A. The modules measure 1,910 mm x 1,133 mm x 30 mm and weigh 29 kg.
The smallest series features five modules with a power output ranging from 410 W to 430 W and an efficiency of 20.99% to 22.01%. These panels measure 1,724 mm x 1,133 mm x 30 mm and weigh 26 kg. Their open-circuit voltage is between 37.45 V and 38.26 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.88 A and 14.17 A.
All panels have an operating temperature between -40 C and 85 C and a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius. They all feature junction boxes with IP 68 ratings, 20 mm solar glass, and 30 mm anodized aluminum alloy frames.
The manufacturer offers a 15-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee for 87.4% of the initial yield. It said the TOPCon technology offers advantages over conventional monocrystalline PERC products, including lower degradation rates in the first year due to light-induced degradation (LID) or light-elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID).
“The TOPCon modules have a very close efficiency to heterojunction (HTJ) and interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cells with a positive factor of a better price and higher stability in the supply chain,” said the company.

Jackery has introduced the Solar Generator 1000, an all-in-one kit with solar modules and a battery bank. 
The battery bank can be charged in 1.8 hours via four 200 W SolarSaga panels, or via a wall charger. The ergonomic design fits 1,002 Wh capacity into a highly portable, 12-pack cooler-sized battery unit that weighs about 25 lbs (11.3 kg). 
The company says the fully charged generator can charge camping lights for 76 hours, electric grills for 50 minutes, mini fridges for 66 hours, Macbook Pro for eight charges, and iPhones for 100 charges. It can be recharged with the SolarSaga panels anywhere the sun shines, with no connection to the electric grid.
The Solar Generator 1000 is equipped with five DC outputs, including two USB-A ports, two USB-C ports, and one 12V car port. It also houses three AC outputs at 120V, 1000 W (2000 W peak). For inputs, the solar generator contains a 120V, 50 Hz, 15A max AC port. It also contains a DC input rated at 17.5V-60V, 11A max, and can double to 22A/800 W max.
The generator operates in super-quiet mode, marking an improvement over noisy diesel generators. The unit operates under 46 decibels.
The lithium-ion Solar Generator 1000 is optimized to operate in concert with Jackery’s SolarSaga 100W panels. The lightweight panels weigh only 9.1 lbs and have a fold-out design for easy setup. Built-in kickstands allow for the panels to be placed at the ideal angle and azimuth.

The StoVentec Photovoltaics Inlay product consists of a ventilated facade equipped with solar panels and thermal insulation technology. The system is made of a layer of rock wool insulation and a substructure with patented profiles, into which the double-glass PV modules are inserted.
The solar modules are encapsulated in a black frame, with a nominal power of 305 W and a size of 1,668 mm × 994 mm.  The cell connectors are black. The facade insulates the enclosure, improves the sound insulation value by up to 12 dB, ensures protection against moisture and is also permeable to vapor diffusion. Its fire behavior is B-s1, which means hardly flammable, according to the EN 13501-1 standard.
The modules can be aligned in vertical or horizontal arrangements.
“Despite the fact that photovoltaic systems on the façade may present a lower total annual yield compared to panels on roofs, they have the great advantage that they are better adapted to seasonal demand, since the performance, compared to the other solutions, is higher in the colder months, from autumn to spring, when the sun is lower,” said José Almagro, general director of Sto Ibérica.
Sto manufactures thermal insulation products and systems for facades, exterior and interior cladding, ventilated facades, acoustic ceilings, concrete repair and protection, and floor coverings. It has a presence in 80 countries and four continents.

The company said its representatives recently met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, Prime Minister Moustafa Madbouly, and Minister of Electricity Mohamed Shaker to review the status of the Gregy Elica Interconnection Project.
In October 2021, the European Network of Transmission System Operators (Entso-E) included the project in its 10-year Development Plan of the European Energy Networks (TYNDP 2022).
“Its inclusion in TYNDP 2022 will be the first necessary step that will launch the process of inclusion of this ambitious project in the 6th list of Projects of Common Interest (PCI) of the European Union in the context of the interconnection of the European Energy Networks,” Copelouzos Group said at the time.
The 700 MW cable will facilitate the transmission of 9.5 GW of wind and solar power in Egypt to the Greece-Italy and Greece-Bulgaria electricity transmission networks. It will be deployed at a maximum sea depth of 2,527 meters.
“The project is expected to allow renewable energy exports from Egypt to Greece at times of high renewable enery generation and also vice versa contributing to a significant increase of participation of renewables in the energy mix and reduction of greenhouse emissions of the power sector,” Entso-E said on its website. “The project is rather complex since, besides its extensive length, it implicates various transmission system technologies, such as AC and DC lines, overhead, underground and submarine transmission lines.
The project will likely be commissioned in 2028, said Entso-E.

The Canadian province confirmed last week that the 4 GW of new power capacity required from 2025 will consist of at least 1.5 GW of storage plants, the same volume of natural gas electricity generation, and 1 GW from “other sources.” Last year, the province estimated its immediate future energy needs ran to 5 GW.
The current edition of pv magazine casts an eye over the Asia-Pacific solar markets, considering how cross-border interconnections can drive better resource efficiency, as well as the crucial role microgrids can play in the continuing roll-out of photovoltaics. We also examine the Tango fab being planned in Sicily by Italian energy group Enel as part of Europe's attempts to shore up energy security with a domestic solar supply chain.
“Our government is building the electricity generation and storage needed to support our success in driving electrification and attracting new jobs to the province, including unprecedented investments from electric vehicles and battery manufacturing to clean steelmaking,” said Minister of Energy Todd Smith. “Saying no to jobs and investment is a non-starter for our government. An unreliable system with brownouts and blackouts is a non-starter for our government. With today’s actions we are ensuring that the electricity will continue to be there for families and businesses when they flip the switch.”
The government notice, which described the planned tenders as “the largest battery procurement in Canada's history,” also noted that public utility Ontario Power Generation is developing Canada's first small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear plant. It is not clear whether the SMR facility will form part of the “other” 1 GW of power capacity to be tendered by the provincial government.
The Canadian Renewable Energy Association presented the policy, which was first announced last year, as up to 2,500 MW of new energy storage and other non-emitting resources.
“Our government is building an integrated supply chain for critical minerals in Ontario as we become a leader in battery manufacturing,” said Ontario Minister of Mines George Pirie. “Energy system reliability and affordability is essential so that Ontario mines can continue to competitively produce the critical minerals we need for battery manufacturing and other technologies that support the transition to a clean economy.”
