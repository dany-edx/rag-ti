Shipments to Europe have slowed significantly, with Belgium and Spain reporting year-on-year declines of 60%, while Italy saw a drop of more tham 40%. In contrast, South Africa has emerged as a standout market, with shipments surging by more than 300% year on year.
Europe's residential inventory levels, particularly for imported systems, rose considerably by the end of 2022. Coupled with subdued demand in the first half of the year, this surplus inventory contributed to the decline in shipments.
Overall, the shipments to various European markets tracked by S&P Global Commodity Insights contracted by 3% year on year in the first half of 2023. However, German system suppliers bucked this trend, posting a remarkable increase of nearly 30% during the same period.
“By the end of 2022, S&P Global estimates that inventory levels in key European markets had reached nearly 5 GWh,” Susan Taylor, senior analyst for S&P Global, told pv magazine. “It's worth noting that this also includes products that are in transit from Asia, as well as those waiting to be installed.”
According to Taylor, inventory levels equal to around six months of installations – around 3 GWh – are seen as normal. But the levels that S&P Global calculated in Europe at the end of 2022 were far higher.
“This certainly poses a challenge for the market in the event that demand stops growing as quickly as it had been, as we've seen in the first half of 2023,” Taylor said. “Another knock-on effect from the oversupply and high inventory will be aggressive prices, similar to what is happening with residential PV at the moment, as distributors have to clear their stock.”
Despite high inventory levels, new Chinese suppliers are entering the market and scaling quickly to ship large volumes. This trend will further exacerbate high inventory levels in Europe relative to slowing demand, according to analysts.
In the United States, supply and demand is more balanced. However, S&P Global has also tracked quarter-on-quarter declines in residential storage shipments to the US market since the fourth quarter of 2022.
“This is due to a couple of reasons,” Tiffany Wang, an analyst for S&P Global, told pv magazine. “High interest rates are the main driver, which makes the financing for storage systems looks less appetizing. Marketwise, a backlog of NEM 2.0 solar-only installations, plus decreases in electricity prices in central US means that people are delaying storage installations.”
However, the analysts said that the minor oversupply issue will probably be rectified by the end of the year, thanks to higher demand from NEM 3.0 solar and storage installations in California, which will help to deplete inventory.
Globally, S&P Global said it expects residential energy storage installations to rise by approximately 15% in 2023. However, shipment growth is expected to be more gradual as inventory levels are gradually depleted.
“Residential storage growth in mature markets like Germany will continue, driven by a strong residential PV market and supportive subsidies,” Taylor said. “In general, short-term limitations will stem from reduced consumer spending, while longer-term growth will be driven by retrofitting existing PV systems coupled with the increasing advancements in sophisticated home energy management systems incorporating EV charging, heat pumps, and virtual power plants.”

Areas across Mexico and southern Texas saw reduced cloud, leading to 120-130% of average September Irradiance, according to data collected by Solcast, a DNV company, via the Solcast API.
Storms and a ‘Bomb' cyclone caused by persistent low pressure over British Columbia delivered cloudier conditions, leading to irradiance as low as 70% of long term averages.

Persistent high pressure reduces large cloud formation and redirects low-pressure cloud fronts, leading to periods of clear skies. In September large high pressure systems remained for longer than normal over both eastern Canada and southwestern US and Mexico.
For solar producers, these large and persistent systems have been especially beneficial with Quebec, Ontario and southern Mexico all seeing areas with 140% of the long term September GHI average.
Months like these bode well for the future of large solar installations in the south, with ERCOT having produced 3,301 GWh of Solar in the month. Mexico is also looking to take advantage of their high solar potential, through large solar projects like the planned 1 GW Puerto Peñasco solar plant.

Conversely, low pressure over western Canada & Alaska pulled in cloud from the Northern Pacific, leading to a significant increase in rainfall. This plus a ‘bomb’ cyclone in late September led to reduced irradiance across all of the Pacific Coast, most noticeable in British Columbia, where some locations saw just 70% of average September Irradiance.
Rainfall across the month was 7 mm/day above the September average, and temperatures were 5 C below average. Interestingly, this pattern of high pressure keeping skies clear and creating unseasonably sunny September conditions was also seen across parts of Europe, which also saw similarly high irradiance levels.
Mexico and the southwestern US can expect these conditions to reverse through winter, as El Nino winters tend to see Mexico and the South West under-perform against non-El Nino winter averages.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

It is an optimization of the nickel-iron battery patented by Thomas Edison at the turn of the 20th century. 
The company, which recently started production of its patented dual battery-electrolysis system in the Rotterdam area, currently produces systems up to a couple of megawatts. It aims to manufacture 50 MW systems in its production facility by 2024, and 200 MW by 2025. 
“The technology is based on nickel-iron electrodes. They are combined with alkaline electrolysis technologies that are commercially available today, with a proven track record of 20 to 30 years lifetime,” said Geert Wassens, fundraising associate at Battolyser Systems. “Integration of these technologies remarkably improves performance, lowers cost and increases uptime.”
The electrodes are in a conductive electrolyte circulated through the cells. In the first electrochemical reaction, the electrodes are charged
 and store electrons, acting as a battery. When one keeps charging (overcharge), hydrogen and oxygen are formed in a subsequent reaction. Gaseous hydrogen is produced at the negative electrode (cathode) and oxygen at the positive electrode (anode).
The company said the system could hit a lower LCOH of around €1.50/kg in the most appropriate locations by 2025. 
“In the most favorable geographies, the Battolyser is able to offer ~€2/kg by 2025. An important note to this analysis is that it does not yet include the positive economic impacts of discharging electricity from the Battolyser to the grid, it only considers revenue from producing hydrogen,” Wassens told pv magazine. “Therefore, the advantage in LCOH of Battolyser over competing alternatives will be even greater. Including this value, the LCOH is near to €1.50/kg.”
Battolyser Systems said the battery function can monetize daily power imbalances, while the hydrogen can monetize seasonal power imbalances and provide feedstock to industries that cannot be electrified. It said it can reach up to 85% system efficiency and up to 90% at stack level.
Battolyser Systems has signed a deal to develop a second production facility in the Rotterdam area. In 2026, the production facility, co-owned by the Rotterdam port authority, will be commissioned to add 1 GW of production capacity.
Battolyser Systems and the European Investment Bank (EIB) have also signed a €40 million financing agreement in Rotterdam during World Hydrogen Week.
“The financing will enable the company to scale its production facility in Rotterdam towards mass production of its combined electricity storage and electrolyzer stack system,” said Battolyser Systems.
The company will allocate a portion of the funds to establish the new production facility. It is also gearing up for another investment round, scheduled to launch within 18 months.
“We are targeting customers in Europa and have commercial conversations with projects in MEA and the US,” said Wassens.
The first two factories will be in the Rotterdam area, but the company see the United States as “the next step,” he added.
The company said it does not use any critical raw materials, resorting only to nickel and iron, in line with the recent normative and political developments at the European level, including the RED II and the Critical Raw Materials Act. 
“We have a number of hydrogen projects in the pipeline that we are looking to sign in the near future, although perhaps not necessarily still this year,” an EIB spokesperson told pv magazine.

They claim iz can achieve a steady-state power conversion efficiency of 25.1%.
They said they tried to overcome shunting, which is a typical issue when scaling up perovskite solar technologies from small-area cells to large-area devices. “Shunts” in PV cells create alternate pathways for a solar-generated charge, leading to power losses. Reduced shunt resistance is associated with multiple forms of module degradation and failure, including hotspots and potential-induced degradation.
The scientists built the 24 cm2 tandem cell with a lithium fluoride (LF) interlayer placed at the interface between a hole transport layer (HTL) made of poly-triarylamine (PTAA) and a wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite absorber. This interlayer is the key element that reportedly improves physical contact at the buried interface and mitigates shunting. The deposited the PTAA and WBG perovskite layers through blade coating.
“Sub-optimal interface contact with substantial voids could act as shunting pathways,” the scientists said. “A LiF interlayer was found to avoid the formation of interfacial voids, which is one possible reason for the reduced shunting of etched tandems with a LiF interlayer.”
The researchers deposited the other layers of the tandem cell by sputtering, thermal evaporation, and atomic layer deposition (ALD). They also tested three different configurations of bottom cells and opted for using
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the 24 cm2 tandem cell showed an efficiency of 25.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.89 V, a short-circuit current density of 18.1 mA/cm2 and a fill factor of 0.736.
“This is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the most efficient two-terminal tandem devices reported in the literature with areas of over 10 cm2,” the researchers said.
They introduced the tandem cell technology in “Shunt mitigation toward efficient large-area perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
“The strategy developed here is valuable for developing efficient, reproducible, and large-scale perovskite-silicon tandems,” the scientists said.

In the “Overview of the Potential and Challenges for Agri-Photovoltaics in the European Union” report, the researchers determined this figure assuming an installed capacity per land area of 0.6 MW per hectare, with the EU’s total UAA being 158 million hectares.
“Agri-PV potential of installed capacity is at TW scale for the two main land categories of arable land and permanent grassland and meadow assuming that they are covered by 10 % and 5 % with Agri-PV systems,” the paper states. “If the 10% of EU's UAA is covered with Agri-PV systems, the installed capacity could be between 3.2 and 14.2 TW, while only 5 % of coverage would lead to a total capacity comprised between 1.5 and 7 TW.”
JRC.
Some parameters are still hindering agri-PV’s large-scale success, the JRC researchers found. Issues include no clear definition of what agrivoltaics is or what the European standards are, among others.
“One of the main challenges for Agri-PV is related to the absence of a clear and EU-harmonised definition, which could lead to land characterization changes when Agri-PV systems are installed on agricultural land. This change could have an impact on the eligibility to agricultural subsidies,” the document states.
Member states are also “general” in their plans to support investments in renewable energy, with support for agrivoltaics not explicitly mentioned in a majority country’s strategic plans.
“Technical challenges as well as challenges regarding the permitting and grid connection procedures have been also identified. In addition, there has been an increase in land prices impacting the welfare and security of the farmers. Finally, regardless of the technological advancements, there are still technical challenges that need to be addressed in order to maximize the electricity production while taking into consideration the biodiversity and without compromising significantly the crop yield.”
Agrivoltaics' potential could be unlocked if policymakers made changes, according to the report's 17 recommendations. This includes ensuring certified agri-PV systems were not excluded from common agricultural policy (CAP) subsidies; further research and development, and pilot schemes to overcome technical challenges; financial support through member states’ national policies was provided; and more.
Agri-PV deployment could also be fast-tracked through spatial planning and simplifying permitting and grid connection procedures, with the farmer's economic benefit and property security placed front-of-mind for governments.
“Even though it is not a new concept, the interest for this form of PV deployment has increased rapidly over the last few years mainly due to the increasing need for electricity production and the limited availability of new land due to the increasing global food demand,” the paper states. “Continued research and development, in particular cross-cutting studies that take into account energy, crop yield and biodiversity aspects, will be essential to overcome technical challenges and ensure fully sustainable solutions for the future.”

Germany experienced another accident involving a battery storage system on Oct. 6.
“At around 2 p.m., the fire safety department of the Wernges district was alerted of smoke coming from a two-family house,” Police Chief Inspector Andre Müller of the East Hesse Police Headquarters told pv magazine.
When the police arrived at the scene, local fire departments were already present, but they could not detect any fire. However, an explosion had occurred, resulting in the collapse of the home's eastern wall.
The explosion has been linked to a 30 kWh storage unit in the basement. Preliminary findings from the investigation suggest that a technical defect may have caused the explosion, according to the police officer.
The homeowners managed to evacuate the house independently. The police reported that three individuals sustained minor injuries, including the homeowner, a resident, and a neighbor.
The police estimate the damage to be in the mid-six-figure range, rendering the house currently uninhabitable. Firefighters secured the area with construction fences and provided support to prevent the residential building from collapsing. The police did not disclose any information about the battery manufacturer.
During the latter part of September, there were multiple instances of home photovoltaic storage systems catching fire. In total, pv magazine has learned about five similar incidents in Germany and Austria.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/13/new-research-points-to-wrf-solar-forecast-shortcomings/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ASIA,CHINA",LIOR KAHANA,"OCTOBER 13, 2023",New research points to WRF-Solar forecast shortcomings,"Researchers from China have assessed the accuracy of the WRF-Solar model in simulating global and diffuse radiation, pointing to its sensitivity to aerosol optical depth (AOD), cloud optical thickness (COT), and solar zenith angle (SZA).
The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was developed in 2016 within the Sun4Cast project funded by the US Department of Energy. The model is in the public domain and can be downloaded from the official WRF Github repository.
“Since the release of WRF-Solar, its performance in the simulation of diffuse radiation in localized regions in China and sensitivity to atmospheric parameters have not been fully explored,” the research group said. “This study aimed to test the simulation accuracy of WRF-Solar for global and diffuse radiation using satellite-based aerosol optical properties, which were obtained from a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer.”
The WRF model is widely used for weather forecasting. It uses the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for Global Climate Models (RRTMG) scheme as shortwave radiation input, and the WRF-Dudhia as a radiation scheme. Additionally, the WRF-Solar model uses AOD input for its predictions, while WRF-Dudhia does not.
In their mission to emphasize the sensitivities of the WRF-Solar model, the academics have compared its predictions with real-life observations measured at Wuhan University. As for the AOD sensitivity, the researchers found that simulation error gradually decreased with the increase in the AOD. The parameter measures the scattering and absorption of light by tiny particles, or aerosols, in the atmosphere.
“The standard deviations of simulation errors corresponding to three different AOD ranges, of less than 0.4, between 0.4 and 0.8 and greater or equal to 0.8, were 162.12, 158.15 and 135.45 W m-2 of diffuse radiation, respectively,” they said. “However, when the AOD is greater or equal to 0.8, the model overestimated the diffuse radiation, with an average bias of 58.57 W m-2.”
As for COT, which measures how effectively a cloud layer scatters and absorbs sunlight, the researchers found the error to decrease with a COT increase. The standard deviations of the bias corresponding to COT range lower than 20, between 20 and 40, between 40 and 60, and more significant than 60, reaching 173.40, 149.45, 133.84, and 99.11 W m-2, respectively.
The scientists also looked at the dependence of WRF-Solar error on the SZA. “The simulation error increased as the SZA decreased,” they said. “When SZA <30 degrees, very discrete biases of simulated diffuse and global radiation were observed, with standard deviations of the bias of 245.40 and 286.65 W m-2 and mean differences of 79.20 and -3.62Wm-2, respectively. However, when SZA is between 50 and 70 degrees, the biases of simulated diffuse and global radiation were small, with standard deviations of 136.90 and 121.77 W m-2, respectively.”
However, comparing WRF-Solar to WRF-Dudhia, the researchers found the former to be superior. “In general, the improved WRF-Solar provides highly accurate forecasts in clear conditions. Under all-sky and cloudy conditions, poor comparison results of WRF-Solar and the traditional WRF model were obtained, and the simulated global solar radiation was largely overestimated.”
Their findings are available in the study “Assessment of the high-resolution estimations of global and diffuse solar radiation using WRF-Solar,” published in Advances in Climate Change Research. Concluding the article, the research group has emphasized the “need for improved representation of clouds and circulation in the model through physical parameterization and enhancements of satellite cloud and aerosol data assimilation techniques.”
The team included academics from China University of Geosciences and Hubei Luojia Laboratory.

The research team stressed that traditional hail tests conducted by the IEC 61215-2 standard usually assess the impact of ice balls with a 25 mm diameter and 80 km/h speed. It also said, however, that the Swiss Association of Cantonal Fire Insurers – the Vereinigung Kantonaler Feuerversicherungen (VFK) – established a minimum requirement of 30/40 mm and added that Switzerland's SUPSI PVLab is currently planning to create a hail test stand to reach 100 mm in diameter and 166 km/h in speed.
“The increase in ice ball diameter necessitates the evaluation of sample preparation, repeatability, and representativeness, as well as the ability to handle high speeds with high masses to reduce uncertainty in impact energy, as required by the Swiss standards,” the researchers said.
They utilized a Hopkinson bar, and a 30 mm aluminum bar to analyze the waveform resulting from the collision of the ice balls. They also used a strain-gauge station, a gas gun for ice ball acceleration, and a camera for fast image recordings.
The gas gun was designed to shoot ice balls with diameters of 25 mm, 40 mm, and 70 mm onto the Hopkinson bar. “A round plexiglass tube with different inner diameters was used to guide the spherical ice inside of it,” researchers explained. “To measure the velocity of the spherical ice specimens, a laser sensor was placed at the end of the tube.”
The academics shot the three balls at the same velocity and at two different frozen temperatures, −5 C and −20 C, to compare loading versus time response.
Analyzing the samples having 40 mm diameters, they ascertained that the temperature decrease caused a double loading rate, which in turn caused a higher stress rate on the bar.
“In the case of 25, 40, and 70 mm ice balls at −20 C, peak forces are approximately 70%, 59%, and 44% higher than those at −5 C at the same velocities,” they further explained. “For 25, 40, and 70 mm, ice reaches its peak force in a shorter amount of time at −20 C, which is 30%, 21% and 2% lower than at −5 C.”
The analysis showed that lower temperature results in a higher peak force and a shorter peak time. “Using these preliminary results, the project will move forward with its future tasks, including the analysis of hail stone damage using a multispectral camera, the analysis of PV panels of different ages, ice mechanical characterization in the same strain rate range, and FEM modeling of phenomena,” the scientists concluded.
Their findings were presented in the study “Advanced characterisation of photovoltaics for hail resistance,” published in Materials Letters.

South Korea-based solar module manufacturer Hanwha Qcells is still in patent litigation with photovoltaic competitors in various regions of the world over possible infringement of its patents for a passivation technology.
Now, it also owns the intellectual property rights to Laser Enhanced Contact Optimization (LECO) technology thanks to the finalization of the acquisition of Cell Engineering (CE).
CE started to develop this manufacturing process in 2017 and cooperated than with Hanwha Qcells in transfering it to mass production.
The LECO technique is reportedly able to raise PERC and TOPCon solar cell efficiency by between 0.2% and 0.5%. It reportedly achieves a high throughput through a lean and cost-effective laser treatment.

The total corporate financing deals, however, decreased by 5% year-over-year, with only 124 in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 131 over the same period in 2022.
According to Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu, the solid results from the first three quarters of 2023 were due to a “strong push” towards global decarbonization and incentives from the North American Inflation Reduction Act. “M&A activity, on the other hand, has faced adverse effects, especially in the realm of project acquisitions, due to increased due diligence, higher costs, delays, and a tight labor market,” he said.
“Project developers and independent power producers were the most active acquirers of solar projects in Q3 2023 – picking up 2 GW – followed by insurance companies, pension funds, energy trading companies, industrial conglomerates, and IT firms with a total of 1.6 GW,” Mercom states.
“Investment firms acquired 959 MW; electric utilities acquired 877 MW; and oil and gas companies acquired 759 MW of projects.”
During the first three quarters of this year, there were fewer venture capital funding activity deals – 51 in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 72 over the same 2022 period – but this value increased 4% year-on-year, representing $5.7 billion in Q3 2023 compared to $5.5 billion in Q3 2022.
There were 10 solar top venture capital securitization deals totaling $3.2 billion in Q3 2023 compared to eight deals totaling $2.3 billion in Q3 2022, representing a 39% year-on-year increase. A total of 166 solar top disclosed mergers and acquisitions, comprising 31.6 GW, occurred in 9M 2023. This is compared to 207 projects acquired, comprising 52.2 GW, in 9M 2022.

Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR) and its subsidiary, Vensolair, have partnered with the Salins group, a major European salt producer, to create ground-mounted PV plants on multiple salt production sites.
CNR aims to install approximately 100 MW of solar capacity through this collaboration. The salt producer will provide a dozen locations across the Mediterranean region and Meurthe-et-Moselle department, which consist mainly of underutilized land and former salt production sites.
CNR and Vensolair will develop, construct, and manage utility-scale PV plants on these repurposed lands. Additionally, the agreement allows the Salins group to acquire ownership stakes in the solar plants' special purpose vehicles.
“Our two companies use sun, water and wind to produce salt and electricity. The dal nourishes a common ambition for the ecological transition,” said Laurence Borie-Bancel, President of CNR.
CNR and Salins plan to build experimental PV facilities on active salt production sites, commencing the project next year. The initiative will investigate the advantages of installing solar panels over concentration basins for salt production and assess the impact on the biodiversity within saline coastal regions and the natural course of the Rhône. CNR, a French energy firm, presently manages 4 GW of renewable energy assets.

Queensland Hydro said geotechnical exploratory drilling which will help inform the environmental impact statement (EIS) process has started at the site of the Borumba Dam pumped hydro project. The AUD 14.2 billion ($8.96 billion) project is expected to provide 2 GW of dispatchable generating capacity and approximately 48,000 MWh of large-scale storage to the National Electricity Market.
State-owned Queensland Hydro also said the state’s coordinator-general has declared the project, being developed at the 46,000 megaliter Borumba Dam near Gympie, a coordinated project, enabling an assessment of social, economic and environmental matters to begin.
The project involves building a new dam wall at Lake Borumba that will increase the dam’s storage capacity to 224,000 megaliters. A new dam will also be created at a higher altitude with the two reservoirs connected by an underground power station. Water will be pumped to the upper dam during periods of surplus renewable energy and low demand, and then released back to generate electricity during times of high demand.
Pending successful planning and environmental approvals, the project is targeting first power in 2030.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the project, the first of two large-scale long-duration energy storage projects planned by the Queensland government, will play a key role in the state’s renewable energy transition.
“Pumped hydro is proven technology, ready to go now,” he said. “Borumba will allow us to replace expensive fossil fuels with Queensland’s sun, wind, and water, putting the Sunshine State on the map as a global renewable energy hub.”
The Queensland government is aiming to have 70% renewable energy by 2032 and 80% by 2035, up from about 25% of total power generation at present.
De Brenni said the Borumba project will be subject to Queensland procurement policy with the state government looking for Sunshine Coast companies and tradespeople to be part of the build. At peak construction, the project is expected to deliver an estimated 2,300 jobs.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/13/solar-wafer-prices-hit-record-lows/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 13, 2023",Solar wafer prices hit record lows,"Solar wafer prices plummeted to their lowest values ever when trading resumed after China’s Golden Week, according to OPIS data. Extending their downtrend from before the holiday, Mono M10 wafers plunged a substantial 10.29% to $0.34/pc and Mono G12 wafers fell a similar 7.33% to $0.468/pc.
The main factors behind wafer price reductions are the decline in downstream demand and the accumulation of wafer inventories brought on by the high operating rate of wafer producers, concurred numerous sources.

Based on the production schedules of wafer manufacturers, a market observer estimates that China's wafer production output would be around 65 GW in October. This would indicate an increase of around 8% in comparison to the 60–61 GW of wafers produced in September, according to data from the Silicon Industry of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association.
Approximately 2.4 billion pieces of wafers, or around 20 GW, are presently in stock on the wafer market, according to a source from a major vertically-integrated player. This figure will likely keep increasing soon due to the high operating rates of wafer factories, the source added.
Based on polysilicon’s current pricing, the cash cost for producing Mono M10 wafers at Tier-1 facilities is approximately CNY2.5 ($0.34)/pc, which means that there is still some room for Mono M10 wafers prices – currently average market price of approximately CNY2.78/pc – to fall further, according to a source from the polysilicon segment.
The sales of wafers has also been hampered by downstream manufacturers' reduced production and wait-and-see attitude, OPIS learnt during its weekly market survey. This week also marks the lowest price ever for solar cells, with Mono M10 and G12 cells falling by 8.35% and 2.39%, respectively, to $0.0746/W and $0.0816/W.
According to another market watcher, cell manufacturers currently have no incentive to maintain high operating rates given their low profit margins, resulting in a decrease in wafer demand. This source therefore anticipates that wafer producers may be forced to reduce their prices on a weekly basis due to the steadily declining demand.
“Wafer producers cut production when wafer prices fall to the point when there is no more room for price reduction,” a source from a developer noted.
