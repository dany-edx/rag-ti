It said it halted the procurement exercise partly due to the withdrawal of bidders.
The authority started the tender proceedings earlier this week. It said the suspension was specifically due to the incorrect filing of some documents by one of the bidders.
“It is expected that the bidding will continue,” said the platform.
The CNY 35 billion plant will be built in the city of Jiuquan and will feature 800 MW/1600MWh of energy storage. It will use 8,638 electrolyzers and occupy a total area of 67 km2.
Citic Capital, an investment bank, estimates that the solar-powered hydrogen plant has the potential to produce up to 200,000 tons of hydrogen per year. If achieved, this would set a record in China for both the largest single hydrogen production scale and hydrogen production volume tender. The project is scheduled to be operational by the end of 2026.

In this interview, Lukens discusses his background in the solar industry, Solis' dedication to string inverters, and the company's big push into the utility-scale scene in Europe.
pv magazine: Thanks for your time today, Gregory. When did you join Solis?
Gregory Lukens: Three months ago.
Can you tell me a bit about your experience before joining Solis?
Lukens: I’m an old dog and have been around a few tricks through the years. The last 20 years, I’ve been based in Madrid, Spain, and I’ve been working during that time in solar photovoltaics. I don’t think I’m one of the earliest pioneers in Spain, but we were among the early guys moving around trying to make business back in the day.
Was that in project development?
Lukens: At that time, it was project development, particularly in the commercial and industrial (C&I) sector. We undertook various projects, including shopping malls and installations for IKEA.  I had founded the company, called OpcionDos, with Spanish partners in 2011. In 2011, AEG Power Solutions, a German company, acquired us, marking my entry into the realm of utility-scale solar.
AEG Power Solutions was involved in manufacturing central inverters across different locations like Germany, South Africa, India, and the US. However, there were significant bankability challenges associated with their operations. Subsequently, I joined PV Hardware (PVH), a renowned global tracker company. They had acquired a startup based in California and approached me to assist in Europeanizing the company, which was an ironic twist given my American background. This marked the beginning of a new chapter for PVH.
After spending a few years at PVH, I was recruited by KACO, a German inverter manufacturer later acquired by Siemens. My role primarily involved their European business, but I also became involved in their North American operations due to the presence of their headquarters in San Antonio, Texas.
In 2018, I joined Huawei Spain when the company decided to venture into the solar business. Until that time, Spain was grappling with a moratorium and numerous challenges, leading to minimal activity in the solar industry.
The sun tax…
Lukens: The sun tax, and then, in 2017, the government launched a 4 GW tender and they announced the winners, and that’s when Huawei said, “Oh, I think there’s a market there now.” And that’s when the business started, so I was part of the original team of five or six people.
And how did you decide to make the switch to Solis?
Lukens: While working with Huawei, I gained experience in various global markets, including Spain, Chile, Australia, and Mexico. Solis presented me with an exciting opportunity, and I appreciate their strong focus on their core business. Unlike some other companies, Solis remains dedicated to string inverters and does not venture into other areas like chargers. This focus aligns well with my approach.
Where do you think the competition between string and central inverters currently stands?
Lukens: Personally, I am not a fan of central inverters. They often bring numerous challenges and complications. In contrast, I strongly believe in the benefits of string topology, which offers superior reliability, performance, and operation and maintenance advantages. Solis shares this perspective and aims to support the deployment of string topology in the utility-scale segment, which is widely recognized as the optimal solution by advanced and forward-thinking companies.
Besides inverters, what other components are crucial in utility-scale projects?
Lukens: While the inverter is an essential component, there are other pieces to the utility-scale puzzle. These include communication hardware, such as power plant controllers, and mid-voltage stations.
What are your priorities and focus areas as the Director Utility Europe for Solis?
Lukens: Currently, I'm focusing on completing the certification of our existing machines for the remaining European markets. This process will be finalized in the coming months. Additionally, I'm working on the puzzle pieces I mentioned earlier, which involve communication hardware and mid-voltage stations. At this stage, I'm not actively engaged in sales but rather concentrating on laying the groundwork and hiring the right salespeople. We are targeting some quick wins where customers only require inverters.

Does Solis already have utility-scale sales and ongoing projects in Europe?
Lukens: At present, Solis does not have utility-scale sales or ongoing projects in Europe. While the company has successfully developed utility-scale business in China, India, and the United States, they hadn't previously hired a leader to drive the expansion in Europe. My role is to change that by building expertise, fostering dialogue with our colleagues in China, and ensuring Solis becomes a significant player in the European utility-scale market.
What are the challenges on the R&D side of utility-scale solar?
Lukens: In my opinion, we should explore adding an additional software layer to enhance our offerings. This layer could encompass data analysis, visualizations, and predictive modeling to optimize performance and predict failure rates. Although this may be a consideration for 2024-2025, we need to differentiate ourselves beyond hardware. While hardware innovations like new materials or improved integration with customer SCADA systems are possibilities, the focus should also be on software enhancements.
Lastly, how does bankability differ when transitioning from rooftop to utility-scale projects?
Lukens: Bankability is a critical aspect when it comes to utility-scale solar. The utility-scale market involves professional purchasers and rigorous scrutiny from purchasing departments. ESG requirements are gaining prominence, and stakeholders, including off-takers and project banks, thoroughly assess projects. Solis has an excellent opportunity in this market, as our strong focus on string inverters aligns well with the expectations and demands of utility-scale customers.

It can feel like old news to talk about 2022 halfway through 2023 but the impact of the most pivotal year for energy markets in decades will be felt through 2030. The European Commission doubled down on solar targets to cut Russian natural gas under its REPowerEU plan, targeting 415 GW of total solar by 2025, and up to 750 GW this decade. The scale of ambition is unprecedented: Europe wants to triple its capacity in eight years. Decarbonization is imperative and energy security has also come to the fore, under the EU Solar Strategy.
On the regulatory front, taxes and caps on member-state energy company windfall profits have increased risk premiums, particularly for merchant solar and power purchase agreement (PPA)-backed projects, with further extensions likely to slow buildout.
With electricity bills rising an average 38% in the euro area in the last 18 months, distributed solar’s annual capacity growth shattered records last year. Residential installations hit almost 15 GW across major EU markets while commercial and industrial additions rose to 13 GW.
Wood Mackenzie’s base case scenario sees Europe adding almost 400 GW of solar to 2030, meaning the EU will fall short of its target by nearly 150 GW – with today’s cumulative capacity at around 200 GW. The only way to bridge that gap is to tackle grid, permitting, and supply chain constraints.
Corporate PPAs will drive utility scale solar as tightening environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) requirements and structurally higher electricity costs incentivize business take-up. Spain remains Europe’s largest PPA market but volumes are accelerating in Germany, France, and Poland.
Local opposition and permitting processes will continue to slow growth, particularly in Italy, and grid issues are acute in the Netherlands, where congestion management has been used in recent years.
REPowerEU is betting on rooftop solar because of its modular nature and the continent’s vast, untapped potential. The European Solar Rooftop Initiative targets 52 GW to 58 GW more capacity by 2025 in its conservative scenario. This is an ambitious but achievable objective amid structurally higher retail electricity rates and a return to a downward trajectory in component costs. We predict distributed-solar’s levelized cost of energy (LCOE) will decline almost 30%, on average, this decade.
With net metering being replaced by less generous compensation for prosumer electricity grid exports, the European Commission’s toolbox to maximize rooftop PV relies on building mandates which will kick in from 2026 to 2028 and will also back energy communities. It is unclear how many member states will apply mandates, what exemptions will be granted, and whether additional capital expenditure subsidies or tax incentives will help rollout.
Regardless, household solar will keep pace to 2030 and the sector must attract low- and-medium-income customers and collective systems for apartments. Energy communities will help democratize residential solar.
Upfront expense will remain the biggest entry barrier for households. Third-party, subscription-based ownership models could relieve financial constraints and alleviate technology risks associated with subpar installations.
Heating and transport electrification will gain steam by 2025. Heat pump and domestic electric vehicle (EV) charging stations will further push residential solar. As home loads climb so will electricity costs, strengthening rooftop PV.
Upfront cost will again be a hurdle so heat pumps and EV chargers will require subsidies and interest-free finance as well as bans on natural gas heaters and internal combustion engine vehicles.
Along with home energy storage solutions, heating and transportation electrification will help harmonize home energy consumption and peak generation profiles, providing grid flexibility. This will be an invaluable benefit as governments phase out compensation for surplus-electricity grid exports. The case for maximizing self-consumption will only grow.
On the commercial solar front, the 2026-27 rooftop mandates for commercial buildings will be major drivers for growth; along with volatility in retail electricity rates, and improvements in installation and operational cost efficiencies.
Supply chain volatility poses a significant downside risk to increased solar buildout across segments. Equipment cost inflation since 2020 has already led to project cancellations and auction undersubscription all over Europe, as ceiling bid prices remain low compared to LCOE levels and corporate PPA prices.
However, PV component prices have started to come down and will continue to fall as supply and demand stabilize. But this story of generalized cost declines could look different if the European Commission achieves its objective of enforcing uptake of domestically manufactured equipment for public auction tenders, increasing costs for developers.
This localization strategy is in part a response to the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States but is also a push to diversify Europe’s PV technology supply away from China, in an environment of heightened geopolitical tension. If these efforts solidify, and are complemented by local content requirement policies, we could see PV component prices soar anywhere between 10% and 40%. That will depend on how much the EU enforces reshoring of the overall PV manufacturing supply chain.

“We aimed to improve the life cycle climate performance using a solar energy-powered heater in a residential air conditioner,” the research's lead author, Azim Dogus Tuncer, told pv magazine. “We found that using the heater in the system improved the coefficient of performance and decreased negative environmental effects by reducing the energy consumption of the compressor in the system.”
The scientists investigated, in particular, how the energy consumption of an air conditioning (AC) system may be improved by using PV and then assessed the environmental impact of this approach via the life cycle climate performance (LCCP) method, which includes all cradle-to-grave emissions.
The experimental setting included two 20 m2 insulated rooms with a total area of 65 m2. One of the rooms was equipped with solar-powered AC while the other one used AC powered by grid electricity.
The PV-energized system was in turn equipped with a heater added to the compressor inlet of the air conditioning system to heat the refrigerant, with pressure and temperature sensors being utilized to observe the changes. The scientists also used a wattmeter to measure the electricity consumption of the compressor.
They also assumed the outdoor AC system to have a capacity of 3.5 kW, a seasonal coefficient of performance of 38 W/W, and an energy efficiency ratio of 9.40 BTU/hW. Its dimensions are 880 mm x 280 mm x 363 mm and its weight is 27.2 kg. Its refrigerant is R410A and the expected lifetime is 15 years.
“The units have been connected with a copper pipe of about 2 m in length and insulation was made to prevent any effect on the pipe, the research team explained. “The heater has one inlet and one outlet with a copper pipe. At the inlet of the heater, there is the part sent to the compressor at the outlet of the refrigerant returning from the indoor unit.”
It tested the system with different heater set values of 18 C, 19 C, and 20 C, respectively, and ascertained that heaters set values
decreased by 7.74%, 26.62%, and 27.28%, respectively. It also found that the use of PV significantly reduces both energy and emission values.
They presented their findings in the study “Experimental investigation of a solar-assisted air conditioning system: Energy and life cycle climate performance analysis,” published in Thermal Science and Engineering Progress.

According to data compiled by electronics distributor Avent Abacus, total investment in European solar startups is up 398%, from just $1.2 billion raised in the same period a year earlier.
Avnet Abacus, which acts as a consultant to engineers when designing new products, analyzed Crunchbase data for companies listed under solar and other renewable energy categories to provide insight on the level of funding going into those sectors. It found that investment is up 47% globally, with funding of the sector down 7% in the United States so far this year.
Despite continued uncertainty in the venture capital market, average investment in European solar is at an all-time high at $166.1 million, compared with an average of $88.3 million in 2022 and $22.9 million in 2021. The average amount of venture capital flowing into European solar so far this year eclipses the sector’s global average of $116.8 million and the US average of $113.8 million.

“Even though solar technology is relatively mature, there is still a lot of room for growth and innovation. There is growing demand around the world, and government policies and incentives continue to support investment in this area, with engineers continually seeking new ways to make solar more efficient,” said Sara Ghaemi, Avnet Abacus’s technical director.
According to Avnet Abacus, there are almost six times more startups focused on solar than wind energy in Europe, and it’s the consumer market that’s driving the expansion. Indeed, rooftop installations accounted for 66% of the EU’s solar capacity at the end of 2022, according to SolarPower Europe. Amid a slower-than-expected increase in large-scale solar, the total share for rooftop PV is expected to decrease only slightly to 59% by 2026.
Driven by rising electricity prices, interest in solar has grown exponentially. In Europe, specifically, a growing number of companies serving the residential sector and, in some cases, the commercial solar segment, have raised capital from a mix of investor types, particularly for lighter, more aesthetically pleasing, or easier-to-install rooftop PV designs.
In addition, the complexity of solutions has increased over the years, with startups now offering services and a software layer on top of that. One such example is Hamburg-based 1Komma5°, which last week raised €430 million in a Series B round, helping it to become Germany's latest unicorn, with a value of more than €1 billion ($1.09 billion) in just 23 months of existence.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/29/sungrows-james-li-discusses-liquid-cooling-for-ess/,"UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,EUROPE,IRELAND,NORWAY,UNITED KINGDOM",TRISTAN RAYNER,"JUNE 29, 2023",Sungrow’s James Li discusses liquid cooling for ESS,"James Li of Sungrow Power Europe shared insights on the inverter manufacturer's new utility-scale energy storage system (ESS), the PowerTitan 2.0 ESS. Li discussed the purpose of the solution, enhancements over the previous version, regional availability, the successful implementation of all-liquid cooling, and density advantages.
pv magazine: It's great to see your announcement of the PowerTitan 2.0 ESS. Can you tell us what has changed from the PowerTitan to the new PowerTitan 2.0?
James Li: The main change is based on valuable feedback we received from customers in the UK, Israel, and other places. They expressed a need for higher power density, particularly in areas where land availability is limited. As storage demands move closer to residential and urban areas, the cost of land is rising, and noise has become a concern. They requested a smaller system footprint. That's why we introduced the PowerTitan 2.0, offering a 5 MWh battery and a 2.5 MW PCS.
We have doubled the density while fitting everything, including the PCS, into a 20-foot container. It's quite impressive to have the whole system in such a compact container, making logistics easier.
Has the shift to liquid cooling enabled this change? Or was there something else?
Li: When we initially launched the first generation, we already had future product options in mind. It required significant engineering efforts to incorporate liquid cooling into our product swiftly. It's our first time using liquid cooling for the entire system, replacing the previous air cooling method.
Liquid cooling is applied to both the PCS and battery storage, providing advantages in terms of thermal management. With air cooling, there is a temperature difference of around 10 degrees, whereas with liquid cooling, it reduces to about 2.5 degrees. This translates to an extended lifespan of approximately two years, which is significant. Additionally, the string PCS allows for individual charging and discharging of battery racks, resulting in over 7% increased energy capacity during the life cycle and improved overall efficiency.
What was the main challenge you faced in introducing liquid cooling to the market?
Li: Designing air cooling systems is relatively easier in terms of thermal management and heat flow for cooling the entire system. On the other hand, liquid cooling necessitates more meticulous design considerations, including pipe layout to ensure efficient cooling and proper flow direction. This process takes time and careful control. Despite the additional design constraints, liquid cooling provides better overall control, making it highly effective. It particularly suits utilities facing land constraints, especially those seeking installations with more than 20 MWh of energy storage.
For a 100 MWh energy storage project using the PowerTitan 2.0, it will only occupy approximately 1,200 square meters, significantly reducing the required land footprint.
How does this approach differ from other solutions in the same market segment? How effective is it?
Li:  The PowerTitan 2.0 is a professional integration of Sungrow’s power electronics, electrochemistry, and power grid support technologies. The PowerTitan 2.0 distinguishes itself in terms of its 20ft container size, which is the smallest in the market segment. The high density of the system positions us as the leading choice for transportation and logistics. Although it is heavier than the first generation, it can still be easily transported within a 20-foot container.
Another key aspect is the adoption of liquid cooling for both the PCS and the battery. This not only provides superior thermal management but also significantly reduces noise. As we see a shift towards storage systems located closer to residential areas, the reduced noise level of around 4 dB, on a log scale, which makes it a lot, becomes highly advantageous. The new system operates at approximately 75 dB, compared to the previous 79 dB.
However, the most significant advantage lies in its efficient land utilization, which has been our primary focus.
Are you still offering the original PowerTitan alongside the PowerTitan 2.0?
Li: To avoid confusion, we continue to offer the original PowerTitan to all customers. However, the PowerTitan 2.0 is only available as an option in specific regions. These regions include Israel, the UK, the Nordics, and Ireland, where there is high demand for storage but limited land availability. In these locations, customers require higher density and longer duration for their storage systems.
The PowerTitan 2.0 is specifically designed to meet these customer requirements and is not available in countries like Germany, where the grid capacity is larger.
Is the liquid cooling option more expensive?
Li: Overall, we believe that offering the liquid cooling solution with the PowerTitan 2.0 can deliver cost savings. The smaller size, higher density batteries, and integration into a single 20-foot container result in overall savings for customers when considering all capital and operational expenses. This reduction in size by approximately 30% and the extended service life of two years contribute to real savings.
While the PowerTitan 2.0 may have a higher unit cost, taking into account all capital and operational expenses, it proves to be a cost-effective solution.
Based on your experience with PowerTitan installations in the field, what kind of feedback have you received from customers?
Li: Customers have become more professional in their approach, and we have likewise become more professional in response to their needs. For example, customers increasingly demand greater assurance when it comes to firefighting systems. Our system meets or exceeds all requirements and carries the CE marking. However, some customers, particularly in the USA who work with consultants, also seek UL certification. We continually strive for full compliance in all regions, providing evidence and test reports to offer customers the highest level of confidence.

Spain's Ministry for the Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge (MITECO) has published a revised draft of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (PNIEC) with a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 32% compared to 1990 – surpassing the previous goal of 23%. The draft is currently open for public consultation until Sept. 4.
To meet these targets, the new energy strategy outlines a plan to have 214 GW of total installed capacity in the electricity sector by 2030. This includes 160 GW from renewable generation and 22 GW from various forms of storage.
The document acknowledges that the distribution of technologies is subject to change based on factors such as technology advancements, costs, availability, and integration capacity. It emphasizes the potential of photovoltaics, projecting a capacity of 76 GW by 2030, including 19 GW for self-consumption. The previous version of the plan aimed for 39 GW of solar photovoltaic capacity. As of the end of 2022, the PV source had reached 20 GW, indicating a need to deploy an additional 56 GW in the next eight years.
The plan also includes the addition of 62 GW of wind power, including 3 GW of offshore wind, 14.5 GW of hydro, and 4.8 GW of concentrated solar power (CSP). Non-renewable technologies are accounted for as well, with expectations of 26.6 GW of gas combined cycles and 3 GW of existing nuclear power plants by 2030.
Furthermore, the new plan raises the target for green hydrogen generation through electrolyzers to 11 GW, compared to the 4 GW outlined in the current roadmap.
José Donoso, director of the Spanish solar energy association UNEF, expressed a positive view of the new plan, stating that the objectives are attainable. He emphasized the importance of storage expansion and urges expedited regulatory measures to facilitate action.
Regarding the industrial plan mentioned in the draft, which addresses solar manufacturing, Donoso pointed to the budget of €1 billion ($1.09 billion) and the growing interest of panel manufacturers to invest in Spain. He emphasized the need for swift administrative authorizations and suggested promoting a “welcome packet” to attract investment.

US-based investment giant BlackRock has raised more than AUD 500 million, including a AUD 100 million investment commitment from Clean Energy Finance Corp. (CEFC), to help finance the Waratah Super Battery in New South Wales.
The Waratah Super Battery (WSB), being built by BlackRock battery offshoot Akaysha Energy north of Sydney, is designed to unlock latent transfer capacity in the existing transmission system. It will help to integrate renewable energy and maintain grid reliability by acting as a “shock absorber” during power surges.
Akaysha has been contracted to deliver a battery capable of providing a guaranteed continuous active power capacity of at least 700 MW and a guaranteed useable energy storage capacity of at least 1,400 MWh. The company plans to trade the additional 150 MW/280 MWh of capacity in the electricity market as well as potentially releasing it during off-peak times.
Charlie Reid, BlackRock’s co-head of climate infrastructure in the Asia Pacific region, said the battery will add greater reliability and resilience to the power grid and will help Australia achieve its renewable ambitions.
“We firmly believe battery storage is the critical technology of today, applied both on a small scale in homes and for large-scale battery platforms like the Waratah Super Battery,” said Reid.

KSnI3 is a perovskite material that doesn't contain lead and has already been used in solar cell applications by previous research. “This is not the first attempt at building cells based on KSnI3,” the research's corresponding author, Grishma Pindolia, told pv magazine. “Two more papers have been published by our research team in 2023 itself, which show the potential of KSnI3 as an absorber material in solar cells.”
The group used an organic electron transport layer (ETL) with optimized defect concentration and improved interface and doping density for the solar cell, claiming the use of this ETL is less expensive than that of inorganic ETLs based on materials such as titanium oxide (TiO2) . “The inorganic charge transport layers (ETLs) require complex deposition techniques, which are not very cost friendly and the reported efficiencies of perovskite solar cells with organic ETLs are higher than those with inorganic CTLs,” it explained.
The scientists used a numerical module and the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells that was developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium, to simulate a solar cell utilizing ETLs based on either phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) or buckminsterfullerene (C60). They also tested organic HTLs relying on spiro-OMeTAD, poly-triarylamine (PTAA), polymer Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), PEDOT: PSS, and D-PBTTT-14.
“We optimized the defect concentration of the layers and the interfaces, doping density and thickness of the layers, and the shunt and series resistance of the device,” the scientists said, noting that they also used a gold (Au) metal contact and a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate for the solar cell. “The optimized thickness of PTAA, KSnI3, and C60 was 30nm, 980nm, and 10nm respectively.”
Through their simulation, the academics found the device may achieve a power conversion efficiency of 10.83% and a fill factor of 80.8%. It may also achieve an open-circuit voltage of 0.76788 V and a short-circuit current of 17.44879 mA/cm2.
The device is presented in the paper “Effect of organic charge transport layers on unleaded KSnI3 based perovskite solar cell,” published in Results in Optics. “The present work may be helpful in designing lead-free, non-toxic tin-based perovskite solar cells in the future,” the research team concluded.

Italian garden supplier Giulio Barbieri has developed an isothermal PV pergola that can be combined with battery storage. The “Eclettica Solar Power” solution is a waterproof, snow-resistant pergola.
The manufacturer describes it as a “new synthesis to respond to a growing and unstoppable green sensibility, combined with the search for environmental, thermal and visual comfort that satisfies all the senses. The pergola can be equipped with 3.06 kW, 4.08 kW, and 5.10 kW PV systems featuring modules with half-cut designs and 500 W of output, supplied by Slovenian panel maker Bisol.
The system can also be equipped with one or two battery packs for energy storage. The company offers an optional “high-efficiency” storage system designed for home security.
The PV pergola also features a 4 kW hybrid inverter that makes it possible to connect one or two external 5 kWh lithium-iron-phosphate battery packs capable of guaranteeing 10,000 discharge and charge cycles, maintaining a residual capacity of 70%. This results in a low risk of domestic fires and environmentally friendly technology, said the company.

In the latest issue of pv magazine we turn the spotlight onto European solar with a comprehensive review of the state of the PV industry across the region’s key markets and a look at the legislation which aims to drive a solar rooftop boom. We also examine the difficulty of establishing a solar panel recycling industry in Australia, where industry backbiting isn’t helping matters.

German Federal Transport Minister Volker Wissing visited the first PV system to cover Autobahn 81 at the Hegau-Ost service area in Germany this week, as the pilot project is nearing completion.
The installation is a collaborative research effort between Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, supported by participating research institutes including Fraunhofer ISE, Forster FF, and the Austrian Institute of Technology. While the original plan was to directly cover the motorway, the adjacent through lane was chosen instead.
The PV roof area, consisting of solar modules on a steel structure, was supplied by Solarwatt. It has a total output of 33 kW. Completion of the PV system is scheduled for July.
The German Federal Ministry of Transport claims that there are benefits for solar rooftops over motorways, particularly near tunnels or rest areas, where the electricity can be used directly. However, stringent safety requirements for the fast-flowing traffic underneath must be met.
Federal Transport Minister Wissing noted the significance of solar on federal highways in achieving climate neutrality, and legislation aims to expedite and simplify the expansion of PV on and near motorways. Federal Autobahn GmbH is actively seeking suitable locations, with the goal of achieving climate neutrality for its own area by 2040. The pilot project will be scientifically monitored by the Federal Highway Research Institute for one year.
The new legislation also facilitates the installation of PV modules by municipalities, residents, and investors in the vicinity of federal motorways. Noise barriers, in particular, have been identified as suitable installation areas for solar. A register of potential areas is currently being compiled, and the ministry aims to simplify the planning process to encourage the implementation of renewable energy systems along federal trunk roads.
