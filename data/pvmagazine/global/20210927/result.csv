Spanish energy giant Iberdrola has submitted several proposals to hybridize some of its wind farms in Spain with solar plants.
According to the Spanish Official Journal, the company plans to build a PV plant with a capacity of up to 33.3 MW in the municipality of El Almendro, Huelva province. It already operates a 22 MW wind farm in the province, which is in the southern region of Andalusia.
The company also intends to build a 49.5 MW solar park across the municipalities of Vara del Rey, Sisante and Tébar, in the same province. It will connect that capacity to a similarly sized wind facility it owns in the area. 
In addition, Iberdrola plans to couple a 57.6 MW solar project with a 40 MW wind farm in Huelva province, spanning the municipalities of Ayamonte, San Silvestre de Guzmán and Villablanca.
Finally, it plans to build a 45.5 MW solar farm in El Almendro. That project will be linked to a hybrid wind solar complex that is expected to have a capacity of 76 MW.
The company is currently building one of the world's largest hybrid wind-solar projects in Port Augusta, South Australia. It is investing AUD 500 million (€364.2 million) in that installation. It will combine 210 MW of wind power with 107 MW of solar PV.
The company aims to start commercial operations at Port Augusta this year. The project will involve suppliers from around the world.

A senior power ministry official from Bangladesh’s Prime Minister’s Office told pv magazine that Cyclect Energy was the only bidder for the 50 MW Chuadanga PV project, with a proposed tariff of US$0.12/kW.
He added that this is higher than the tariffs quoted for the two PV power plants in the Chittagongand Netrokona district by other, unnamed, companies.
The Prime Minister’s Office thus approved a proposal allowing the Ministry of Power to negotiate with Cyclect Energy to reduce the tariff under an amended to the Quick Enhancement of Electricity and Energy Supply (Special Provision) Act 2010,
“We have had the first negotiation meeting with the company recently and are hopeful that the price will go down,” the official said, adding, “We decided that instead of buying power at a high price, we have the scope to negotiate price under the special act and now we are doing so.”
Cyclect Energy has already secured 175 acres of land for the project, located close to Chuadanga 132/33 kV Grid Substation. Once a final price has been negotiated, a power purchase agreement will be sent to the cabinet committee on economic affairs for approval. The BPDB will buy electricity from the solar power plants for a period of 20 years.
Overall, Bangladesh has set a new roadmap to generate 40% electricity from renewables by 2050. Presently, the country generates just 766.8 MW, which is around 3% of total generation capacity.

Although relatively small in size, the completion of the solar park represents a new beginning for Czech PV, as utility scale PV projects have been banned for years from the country's energy landscape and solar was also excluded by the planned auctions for large scale renewables.
“CEZ Group is currently planning solar plants with thousands of megawatts in industrial areas or on reclamation sites, which will replace coal-fired power plants,” the utility said in a statement. The group currently operates around 120 MW of PV capacity, most of which was deployed in 2009 and 2010, when a FIT scheme for large scale solar was in place which the media blamed as too generous, amid accusations of fraud by the country’s “solar barons.” In 2014, a special solar tax of 26% was levied on FITs paid to large scale facilities connected in 2010.
“There are more large scale projects under development in Czechia, that are hoping to be financed through the modernisation fund that was announced this year,” Jan Krčmář, chairman of the Czech Solar Association, told pv magazine. “These projects will need to secure a PPA, as there are no auctions or other incentives for new solar power plants.”
According to him, however, the PPA market is currently one of the main bottlenecks in Czechia, which the association has been warning about for years. “New large projects will receive capex subsidies, but will otherwise have to find a commercial off-taker,” Krčmář explained. “The problem is that banks tend to prefer long-term PPAs of approx[imately] 10 years, which are not common at all in Czechia, and you can count the number of PPAs related to renewable energy projects on one hand.”
Krčmář said that there are several investors that want to build large scale PV but do not know what to do with the electricity produced and what business model they should adopt. “We have made this a priority in the association and want to prepare a PPA platform and a PPA standard for companies to use to help kick-start the market,” he also stated. “We are now seeing that after 11 years of constant uncertainty, there just isn't the level of trust from banks and investors in the market, which is why we think that PV auctions would have been a better way of kick-starting the PV market, and not a capex subsidy.”
Launched on May 31, the SER+ program has a budget of CZK4.5 billion (€177 million). The funds are being assigned through a series of competitive calls, and projects located in areas affected by a decline in coal mining will be prioritized. Each selected project may secure funds to cover up to 50% of the costs for buying and installing the PV system, for a maximum of €280,000 per megawatt installed.
Of the program's total budget, CZK1 billion (€39.3 million) is allocated for projects not exceeding 1 MW in size and CZK3.5 billion is earmarked for solar installations with a capacity of over 1 MW.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Czechia had 2,073 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2020, 13 MW less than it had at the end of 2019. The nation has also provided incentives for rooftop PV through a Green Savings Program, and to solar-plus-storage projects through a separate, dedicated scheme.

The Indian government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for gigawatt-scale manufacturing of high-efficiency solar modules has received bids for 54.8 GW of capacity, with participation from existing manufacturers and new players alike. Half of the 18 bidders are new to solar manufacturing.
The shortlist includes Adani Infrastructure, Jindal India Solar, Reliance New Energy, and Shirdi Sai Electricals, with each of them winning top marks because they offer the full extent of integration up to the polysilicon production stage and a maximum capacity of 4 GW each. U.S. thin-film module maker First Solar is also a strong contender.
The shortlist also includes Coal India, CubicPV, Larsen and Toubro, and ReNew Power, which submitted bids for module fabs integrated up to ingot-wafer production from outsourced polysilicon. Avaada Energy, Acme Solar, Emmvee PV, Jupiter Solar, Megha Engineering, Premier Energies, Tata Power Solar, Vikram Solar, and Waaree Energies are also bidders for cell and module manufacturing.
The shortlisted applicants will file bids based on the level of PLI funding they will require for five years after their planned factories are commissioned. The maximum incentive to a single manufacturer will be tied to 2 GW of its annual production capacity, or half of the planned output of its facility – whichever is lower.

Provided by U.S. manufacturer Tesla, the lithium-ion battery solution is the second battery energy storage pilot project implemented by DEWA at the 5 GW solar park. “The pilot project will evaluate the technical and economic capabilities of this technology within the operational framework of electricity systems in solar photovoltaic power plants,” said DEWA chief executive Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer. “It also tests the role of this technology in the integration between clean energy and energy storage to achieve maximum efficiency and reliability.”
A first, 1.2 MW/7.2 MWh facility was built by the utility in 2018. This facility, based on NAS (network-attached storage) battery systems, was provided by Japanese ceramics company and NAS storage provider, NGK Insulators Ltd. These devices were connected to the first section of the big solar park – a 13 MW plant built by U.S. thin film module manufacturer First Solar, in late 2013.
“Both pilot systems allow bi-directional charging,” Waleed Bin Salman, executive vice president of business development and excellence at DEWA, stated.
The entire Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, which is also set to include CSP units and hydrogen facilities, is scheduled for completion by 2030. About 1,013 MW of generation capacity at the 5 GW solar park is currently operational.

The device designed for residential projects is called M15A and is a 16.5 kVa three-phase inverter with two maximum power point trackers (MPPTs). The product has an efficiency of 98.3% and a European efficiency rating of 97.9%. It measures 651x520x220mm and weighs 40.5kg. The device has input voltages ranging between 200 and 1,000 V DC, with a nominal voltage of 600 V.
The new product can operate at an ambient operating temperature comprised between -25 degrees Celsius and 60 degrees Celsius and at an altitude of up to 4,000m. It also features IP66 protection and a cooling technique based on natural convection.
The second inverter, dubbed M20A, is a 22 kvA three-phase device that has the same size and weight as the 16.5 kVa product and is also equipped with two MPPTs. Its efficiency is a bit higher, at 98.5%, as well as its European efficiency, which reaches 98.1%. The input voltages and the nominal voltage are the same as the M15A inverter.
Both products come with a five-year guarantee and the producer says a guarantee extension is possible, depending on the customer's needs.
“Delta’s M15A and M20A Flex have a fan-less design and are cooled exclusively by natural convection,” said Patrick Schahl, product manager of the PVI business unit at Delta Electronics in the EMEA region. “This makes them quiet and ideal for residential and small commercial buildings where low noise is a requirement.”
The manufacturer added that both products are equipped with arc fault detection and reverse polarity protection. “The built-in anti-PID function prevents voltage-induced power degradation in crystalline solar cells, thereby extending their service life,” it further explained. “In addition, replaceable AC and DC type two surge protection devices (SPD) are integrated. Thus, string fuses are not required.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/27/kpis-solar-operators-should-be-tracking-to-overcome-the-data-deluge/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2021",KPIs solar operators should be tracking to overcome the data deluge,"We’re all aware of the scale of the data challenge in renewables. The sheer volume of data produced is a substantial obstacle facing operators in the sector. In the wind industry alone, more than 400 billion points of data are generated every year. Solar might have fewer variables to measure than wind, but typical solar portfolios contain a far larger number of assets, and so operators still must contend with a mountain of information.
Furthermore, it doesn’t help that the quality and reliability of data are a tremendous problem in the solar industry. This can make it extremely difficult to uncover useful data and garner a holistic view of how solar and wind assets are performing.
Indeed, the ‘data deluge’ poses a particular challenge for solar operators and solar asset managers. Wading through huge amounts of project performance data, while also contending with gaps in solar project data caused by unreliable collection practices, is never ideal and often results in solar operators missing critical information.
The next question is, how can solar asset managers efficiently and effectively uncover the actionable information embedded in their performance data that actually adds value while avoiding sifting through the mass of unusable information? This is an area where the right key performance indicators (KPIs) can add significant value.
KPIs quickly reveal issues with underperformance and enable asset managers to fix them, ultimately providing a multitude of benefits to project owners, including improved asset performance, lifetime, and return on investment, along with reduced downtime and more effective business decision-making.
To ensure that solar operators are supported by informative, valuable data, the industry needs to consider implementing additional KPIs which can enable project owners.
In short, asset managers need:
As an asset manager, if you can achieve the above, then you have solved the problem of managing complex solar assets at scale using data. In this article, we’ll zero in on the KPIs that you should make sure you are tracking.
The IPR is a key financial performance metric for solar operators and investors as it can measure the performance of a project’s solar inverters by demonstrating how actual production relates to the energy budget. This enables solar operators to calculate whether the financial expectation for the project is being met, or not as the case may be.
For this, the formula IPR = [Actual energy production (Energy)] / [Reference energy production (Default energy budget)] is used.
The IPR can thus be critical for solar operators seeking to understand whether a solar plant is underperforming, and to then provide the insights needed to rapidly identify the cause of the issue, irrespective of whether the issue is due to a fault with the asset or with the energy budget.
If a solar farm is consistently underperforming – or even overperforming – then adjustments may be necessary to ensure the budget is reflecting real-world conditions, ultimately enhancing budgetary decision-making.
This KPI measures the power output of a PV inverter in comparison to the production that was forecast from the expected solar irradiance given current on-site weather conditions. It delivers crucial insight for operators and investors as it allows them to calculate whether lower than expected production was due to low irradiation levels or problems with the project’s inverters.
Removing doubt as to the cause of a solar asset’s underperformance can significantly reduce costs for site managers, reducing the need to bring in expensive ad-hoc operations and maintenance teams.
For this, the equation Resource index = Solar Irradiation Reference / Solar Irradiation Forecast (on device level) is used.
Weather is a key variable in a solar project’s performance, and a better understanding of on-site climate conditions can help operators and asset managers provide transparency with investors around the causes behind lower-than-expected energy production.
To shed light on the remaining losses that solar operators and asset managers can take action on, rather than issues caused by external factors such as the weather, the Energy Budget KPI can correct a PV inverter’s resource budget with actual irradiance data.
In layman’s terms, this means that the volume of electricity that an inverter generates can be compared to the weather-adjusted Energy Budget, highlighting when the inverters produced more or less energy than the budget predicted – taking into consideration the weather on any given day.
This metric follows the formula: Energy Budget (weather adjusted) = Energy Budget (Default) * RI.
Solar operators and investors need to have their understanding of the financial performance of their assets grounded on real-world conditions. When there is less sun, solar panels will receive less energy, and budgets will either need to be adjusted down to meet those expectations or have the ‘missing’ expected energy removed from them.
Energy budgets can therefore enable operators to calculate the losses caused by the lack of available resources. Without being able to calculate whether inverters are producing 100% of electricity expected in any given weather condition, operators will be unable to confirm to investors whether they are on track to meet their expected returns.
Ensuring that operators and asset managers can measure whether inverters are consistently performing at 100% capacity in all weather conditions is essential. By measuring inverters’ performance in actual weather events, the Operating Performance Ratio can link real-world conditions to inverter performance and highlight where more could have been done to improve the management of those assets during these periods.
This formula compares the actual plant performance ratio to the reference performance ratio: OPR = Energy Actual / Energy Budget (weather adjusted) = IPR / RI.
If a solar inverter is performing at less than 100%, as is the case for the majority of solar farms, the Operating Performance Ratio can therefore support solar operators and asset managers in identifying whether improvements are required with their physical assets or asset management processes – or both.
Another approach that can be highly effective is filtered KPIs designed to highlight specific aspects of asset health.  Solar generators are subject to a wide variety of external performance impairments that do not necessarily represent the health or capability of the asset.  Examples include grid outages, curtailment, shade, and clipping.  The ability to automate the detection and classification of these types of events unlocks additional KPIs such as a Filtered Temperature Corrected Performance Ratio facilitates rapid (and automated) identification of actionable issues, such as tracker stalls, string outages, and soiling.
Information overload is a growing challenge for solar operators and investors and KPIs will become an increasingly essential tool to help pick out important data and enhance a project’s productivity.
Providing transparency and meeting expected return on investment is key to keeping investors happy and having the right KPIs in place which are based on reliable, trustworthy data and can be broken down to identify actionable deviations will enable a holistic overview of a solar project’s performance and support investor reporting.
As solar technology continues to adapt and evolve, greater complexities will undoubtedly follow, but the sector is on the right track to solving the data deluge.

The deployment of solar PV is gaining momentum as the cheapest clean replacement of fossil fuel electricity generation. But the manufacturing of silicon solar cells is at such a scale that to change production of the dominant technology, PERC, or to reconsider investment in emerging technologies such as heterojunction solar cells, is like turning an ocean liner.
A new research paper – a data-driven, number-crunching exposé from scientists at the University of New South Wales School of Photovoltaic Renewable Energy and Engineering (SPREE) – shows that to meet projected solar generation requirements of some 70 terawatts of solar PV by 2050, the industry must urgently steer toward technologies that use less silver, bismuth and indium.
Adjunct Professor Pierre Verlinden has been sounding the alarm of material scarcity in PV for years. Associate Professor Brett Hallam, a SPREE researcher working on how to increase the efficiency of solar cells, is worried about the sustainability of upcoming solutions to boost efficiency. And Yuchao Zhang began his PhD research around the metallization and screen printing used in solar cells when Verlinden and Hallam suggested he look at sustainability first.
“We did some quick calculations that showed, OK, there is definitely a problem for the future consumption of silver, bismuth and indium,” Zhang tells pv magazine Australia.
A team of five co-authors was formed to look into global reserves of these resources, and they drew on the combined expertise of SPREE to calculate how much of each material is currently being used in dominant and emerging technologies, and how much will be required for future PV production.
“Then, from a more technical perspective, we looked at the impact on cell performance of reducing the use of these substances, and how far we could reduce the usage in different solar cell technologies,” says Zhang.
The upshot of the paper – “Design Considerations for Multi-terawatt Scale Manufacturing of Existing and Future Photovoltaic Technologies: Challenges and Opportunities Related to Silver, Indium and Bismuth Consumption,” which was recently published in Energy & Environmental Science – is that the industry and academics must temporarily put aside the pursuit of greater solar cell efficiency and instead focus their abilities on primarily reducing the use of silver in PV.
Possible efficiency gains from new technologies cannot yet neutralize the draining of silver, bismuth and indium reserves as manufacturers ramp up PV capacity to respond to demand for clean energy at a scale that will significantly impact climate change.
The paper takes as its basis that PV module production must increase from 135 GW in 2020 to 3 TW by 2030. It assumes an upper material consumption limit of 20% of 2019 global supply of the three most constrained materials, given that other industries also have a claim to those reserves.
