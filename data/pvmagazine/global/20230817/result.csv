From pv magazine India
NTPC will set up a mechanical energy storage system at its Talcher Thermal Power station in Odisha. The proposed mechanical energy storage system is for demonstration purposes. It will presumably be a solid gravity energy storage system as the tender document suggests the system will be designed to convert electrical power into potential energy for storage and then back to electrical power on demand.
In a solid gravity energy storage system, heavy objects such as concrete blocks are lifted against the earth’s gravitational field through electromechanical equipment. The electrical power that drives the electromechanical equipment to lift the weight to a certain height is stored as gravitational potential energy. The weights can be lowered to release power when it is needed.
NTPC stated its Talcher Thermal Power station has an existing boiler steel structure of around 50 meters in height, which will be repurposed to install the mechanical energy storage system. In this design of the mechanical storage system planned to be implemented at NTPC Talcher Thermal Power station, it is envisaged to have a few concrete/ash blocks hanging from a beam at 50 meters in height, which will fall one after the other in a controlled manner (constant velocity) without any time lag between the falls, ensuring continuous power generation.
The selected contractor’s scope of work includes supply, engineering, design, installation, and commissioning of the mechanical energy storage system.

The plants – Tshepong, Eland, and Nyala – are located in the town of Odendaalsrus, and the power generated will be sold to Harmony Gold Mining under a power purchase agreement (PPA) for a period of 15 years.
African Clean Energy Developments (ACED) was co-sponsor to AIIM / Old Mutual’s IDEAS Fund and was primarily responsible for procurement and PPA negotiations, the technical-commercial interface, and overarching transaction management, including raising debt funding. ACED also oversaw all land and permitting workstreams, and provided construction management.
The Tshepong project is connected directly to Eskom’s Distribution System and wheels energy to Harmony’s point of supply, where Eskom credits them for the energy supplied by the project. The Tshepong project is the first project financed “wheeling” project in South Africa, ACED says.
The Eland and Nyala projects connect directly to Harmony’s electrical system (behind the meter).
Construction of Phase 2 is expected to commence in December 2023 and be completed in FY25, the company says. Once complete, this will add a further 137 MW.
The first 100 MW of Phase 2 will be largely funded using the R1.5 billion green loan that was secured in June 2022, while the remaining 37 MW will be delivered through a power purchase agreement with an undisclosed company.
In 2020, several mining companies operating in South Africa announced their plans to build power plants relying on PV with a combined capacity of 585 MW. These include a 200 MW solar plant under development by gold provider Sibanye-Stillwater, a 75 MW facility planned by Anglo American Platinum, a 40 MW solar park by Goldfields, a 200 MW PV plant by Indian mining company Vedanta, a 30 MW project by Harmony, a 38 MW plant by Orion, and a smaller 3 MW facility by Exxaro.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/17/wafer-formats-continue-to-evolve/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RACKING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,"AUGUST 17, 2023",Wafer formats continue to evolve,"From pv magazine 07-08/23
Cost reduction and efficiency improvement are the shared pursuits of the PV industry, with the former of vital importance in the wafer sector. Manufacturers strive to seek the best wafer thickness and format, leading to the current technology roadmaps for fabricating thinner and larger wafers.
With tier-1 manufacturers taking the lead, the mainstream thickness of positively-doped, p-type wafers now sits at 150 microns and the typical thickness of n-type wafers is 130 microns.
While wafer thickness appears to be gradually unifying, wafer size and shape is a different story. Between 2013 and 2017, 156 mm “M0” and 156.75 mm “M2” wafers dominated the market upon the emergence of aluminum back surface field solar cell technology.

In 2018, the switch to mono PERC (passivated emitter rear contact) technology began a fast-changing wafer-format landscape as manufacturers sought cost optimization. By 2019 and 2020, there were numerous formats available on the market. Today, M6 (166 mm), M10 (182 mm), and G12 (210 mm) wafers account for appreciable market shares, with the latter two the most widely adopted.
When large-format wafers were still nascent, module makers did not reach a consensus on module specs, posing more problems to their raw material suppliers. In September 2021, Longi, Jinko, and JA Solar came to an agreement for modules based on 182 mm cells, with 72-cell, 2,278 mm by 1,134 mm being the most mainstream spec, ramping up the unification of module design across the industry.
Increasing wafer area improves module efficiency and reduces balance of system (BOS) costs and the overall levelized cost of energy for solar. Initially, vertically integrated companies with wafer production capacity adjusted wafer formats to achieve the highest module output. For instance, Longi introduced 182 mm by 183.75 mm wafers using triangle ribbon and flat ribbon segmentation, and JA Solar launched 182 mm by 185.3 mm pieces using gapless flexible interconnection technology. Henceforth, the combination of “rectangular wafers” and “high-density encapsulation” became a focus of the industry for future development.
Having attempted to make the most use of module area while keeping the module spec of 2,278 mm by 1,134 mm, module makers came to realize that the original format did not fully utilize shipping containers. They adjusted the length of modules as a result, coming up with varying specs to accommodate larger wafers.
Module makers kept the width at 1,134 mm to stack two arrays of pallets in a 40 ft shipping container without exceeding the door opening height. In addition to the original spec of 2,278 mm for modules with a higher cell count, manufacturers also innovated while keeping the length within 2,386 mm, in order to house 20 pallets in a 40-foot cube container. Considering EU structural design standards the “Eurocodes,” some tried to keep the length of modules with smaller cell counts within 2 m.
The resulting myriad of wafer formats brings chaos and inconvenience to the PV industry. Non-vertically integrated companies selling or buying customized wafers are having a hard time. Wafer makers have to negotiate orders for rectangular wafers in each format, while cell and module makers struggle to sell leftover customized products. Adjusting fixers or encapsulant, glass, and other components pushes up costs, testing the supply chain management ability of manufacturers.
End users must track the changes of module specs because such diversification complicates system design and management. Once module specs change, customers have to adjust their BOS equipment accordingly, including the distance between mounting holes, the tracking systems, and inverters. Dispatching solar module supply also becomes more difficult for them.
In the latest, “In Conversation” issue of pv magazine we talk to a range of people about their experience with solar, from a sailor and a pair of overland adventurers to a mountain climber and more besides. We also focus on Africa to consider why a continent with such vast solar resource still lags more developed economies when it comes to widespread PV and energy storage rollout.
Despite the heterogeneity, and the absence of an official announcement from any module maker, this year’s SNEC and Intersolar Europe trade shows featured modules from leading manufacturers comprised of rectangular wafers that displayed a smaller disparity in specs.
The length of 45-cell and 48-cell modules still varied between 1,722 mm, 1,762 mm, and 1,780 mm, however. As for 66-cell and 72-cell modules, in addition to the regular 2,278 mm by 1,134 mm, there was also a gain in popularity for 2,380-something mm by 1,134 mm devices. In mid-June, nine manufacturers were reportedly on board for unified module specs, paving the way for the future standardization of modules.

They weigh 9 kg and feature monocrystalline silicon cells with 23.4% conversion efficiency. Each module has its own junction box with MC4 cables.
The manufacturer said on its website that the origami panel is 20% lighter and 10% more compact than conventional panels, and 40% more compact than other folding panels. The Levante solar panel is 100% “Made in Italy,” and its technology is patented.
When unfolded, it measures 180 cm x 165 cm x 2 cm. When folded, the structure is rigid, and the dimensions are 119 cm x 40 cm x 5 cm. The product was developed with two nautical experts behind the Sailing Uma project.
Levante said the origami panels surpass conventional panels in several ways, as they are 20% lighter and 10% more compact. They also outperform other folding panels, with a purported 40% increase in compactness.
The 330 W Origami Solar Panels are ingeniously divided into two sections, and can be interconnected in either series or parallel configurations, delivering varying outputs. When connected in series, they yield a maximum power voltage of 73 V, and a maximum power current of 4.8 A. The open-circuit voltage reaches 84.4 V, with a short-circuit current of 5.1 A.
In parallel connection, the panels achieve a maximum power voltage of 36.5 V, and max power current of 9.7 A. The open-circuit voltage measures 42.2 V, alongside a short circuit current of 10.2 A.
For Kickstarter backers, panel deliveries are scheduled for November, while those who pre-ordered on Indiegogo can anticipate shipments in December. The Kickstarter campaign has garnered support from 77 backers, contributing a total of €85,244 ($93,290).
The 330 W panels are currently available for order on Indiegogo, with a price tag of €1,112, and larger 500 W panels can be obtained for €1,575.
Each set includes the panels and also adjustable telescopic arms for optimal placement, 3-meter MC4 cables, and protective storage bags. The set does not include a solar charge controller or batteries.

On the first anniversary of the passage of the IRA, the historic bill has already begun to stimulate the economy and move the United States toward a carbon-neutral future.
The massive energy, climate and tax bill includes $600 billion in spending, $370 billion of which is focused on supporting renewable energy buildout and climate resilience. The spending will be supported by closing tax loopholes on the wealthiest Americans and corporations. The legislation contains numerous provisions to support the US solar industry, including a long-term extension of the federal investment tax credit, significant domestic manufacturing incentives, labor standards, production tax credits and more. 
Over the past 12 months, numerous industry experts have pontificated on just what the IRA will mean for the US economy, the climate, and supply chain security. The National Renewable Energy Lab, for example, says that it expects that the IRA will increase clean energy to the range of 71% to 90% of total US generation by 2030.
According to new analysis from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), in the year since the IRA went into effect, US solar and storage companies have announced more than $100 billion in private sector investments, with as many as 51 solar manufacturing facilities announced or expanded in the last year.
The impetus behind the growth in solar manufacturing are the production tax credits (PTC) within the IRA. Previously afforded to wind farms, PTCs now include solar for the first time. That clean-energy PTC will be available until the end of 2024 when it will become technology-neutral.
Solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, hydropower, and other eligible projects will bank a tax credit of $0.003 per kilowatt-hour generated, with $0.015 paid to projects built by workers in receipt of a prevailing wage and that met apprenticeship requirements. A higher PTC, of $0.026/kWh, is available for projects built before an “act beginning construction deadline” which will occur 60 days after the Internal Revenue Service specifies its wage and apprenticeship requirements.
In recent months, pv magazine USA has reported on a range of manufacturing announcements across the PV supply chain. German manufacturer Siemens, for example, recently revealed plans to open a string inverter factory in the United States. It plans to supply 800 MW per year to the US utility-scale market.
While US-made inverters are expected to provide only 7 GW of capacity, the capacity expectations of domestically made modules, cells, ingots and wafers are impressive. SEIA projects that by 2026, the United States will have more than 17 times its current manufacturing capacity across the supply chain, or enough to supply a majority of solar projects expected to be built in the United States.
The announcements include:
Among these announcements is Swiss-Germany company Meyer Burger, which will construct a 2 GW per year solar cell manufacturing facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The facility will be used to produce solar cells for its own solar module manufacturing facility in Arizona.
Qcells has also announced plans to manufacture across the supply chain including ingots, wafers, cells, modules and encapsulants to be made a new facility in Bartow County, Georgia, complementing its existing facility in Dalton, Georgia.
“The unprecedented surge in demand for American-made clean energy is a clear sign that the clean energy incentives enacted last year by Congress are working,” said SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper.

One year ago this week, the IRA was signed into law, marking the largest climate and energy spending package in US history. Inside the massive energy, climate, and tax bill is $600 billion in spending, $370 billion of which is dedicated to supporting renewable energy buildout and climate resilience.
The IRA mandates a nationwide reduction of carbon emissions by roughly 40% in 2030. It also targeted a return to domestic manufacturing in the United States, bringing jobs and supply chains back onshore. About $60 billion within IRA is directed toward US manufacturing.
One year later, more than $100 billion in private investment has been announced, leading to the establishment of 51 new facilities or significant expansions, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
“The unprecedented surge in demand for American-made clean energy is a clear sign that the clean energy incentives enacted last year by Congress are working,” said SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper.
SEIA said that more than 155 GW of solar supply chain capacity expansions have already been announced, leading to an estimated $20 billion investment in US communities. The production additions include:
By 2026, it is forecast that the US market will have over 17 times its current capacity across modules, cells, wafers, ingots, and inverters once these facilities reach operations. More than 20,000 US jobs are expected to be created by these facilities, and the US solar manufacturing workforce is set to triple to more than 100,000 positions over the next decade.
In addition, more than 65 GWh of energy storage manufacturing capacity has been announced across 14 new or expanded facilities. Since the IRA was passed, over 3 GW of large-scale energy storage projects have been deployed, and an estimated 100,000 customers have installed a residential solar system paired with battery storage.
“We’ve often dealt with the buy side, through continued tax credits for projects. That really helps installers and developers and end-users,” said George Hershman, SEIA board director and SOLV Energy chief executive officer. “But we really never dealt with how we are going to get product, the supply side. I think the IRA did a great job with supporting the supply side to ensure we build the manufacturing supply chain in the US that we all want to be able to deploy.”
There have been attempts to overturn the IRA or strip core provisions, but Hershman said that early and continued success will neutralize any attempts to throw out the landmark industrial policy.
“We want to win the win,” he said. “We all want to be in a position where we can cut ribbons and put shovels in the ground and say the IRA brought this project to your community. A lot of these projects are in Red counties and Red districts. It’s much harder to fight against a bill that’s bringing jobs and property tax revenues to your district.”
SEIA says that the US solar industry will generate more than $565 billion in private sector investment over the next decade. By 2033, cumulative solar capacity will reach 668 GW, enough to power every home east of the Mississippi River. This is also equivalent to offsetting 459 million metric tons of carbon emissions each year, representing about one-third of all power sector emissions based on 2021 levels.

Hydro Rein will hold 49.9% and OVF 50.1% of the new joint venture.
Hydro Rein will be responsible for project development and construction, and in the first phase, the new company will develop up to seven solar energy projects totaling 655 MW on selected properties owned by OVF. “The size of the solar power plants will vary from just under 20 MW to up to 100 MW,” the company says.
The next step in the collaboration is to conduct thorough investigations of suitable OVF properties and decide on priority areas. When the solar power plants are realized, this will facilitate community development and the establishment of new industry in areas that have had less access to power.
OVF is one of Norway’s largest and oldest landowners. The fund owns several properties with good solar conditions located close to industry sites.

“All these elements require efficient and easy-to-integrate energy harvesting devices to power them,” researcher Thomas M. Brown told pv magazine. “Indoor photovoltaic power sources, on ultra-thin bendable substrates, will have the potential to facilitate these technological innovations if they can provide sufficient energy under indoor illumination rather than the sun.”
The research team built the cell with a substrate made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET).
“Compared to other plastic substrates such as polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), PET offers greater UV durability and is six times more cost-effective,” Brown explained. “These qualities position it as the transparent polymer substrate of choice for plastic electronics.”
The researchers constructed the cell using a sequence of layers, including a PET substrate, an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL), a perovskite absorber, a tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) layer, a Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting layer (HTL), and a top electrode made of gold (Au).
The incorporation of TBAB atop the 3D perovskite matrix helped to reduce defect density and enhance the stability of the overall bulk 3D perovskite structure.
“This, in turn, reduces trap-assisted recombination which is critical for efficient carrier collection in indoor low-light conditions since the photogeneration rate of carriers is low,” the researchers said. “The overall result is a considerable enhancement in device performance.”
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 32.5%. It also maintained more than 80% of its initial efficiency after 1,000 bending cycles.
“The resulting PV cell has 1.4 times higher carrier lifetime, one order of magnitude lower leakage currents, and 3 times lower defect densities, suppressing recombination,” the group stated.
The researchers described the solar cell in “Highly Efficient Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells on Polyethylene Terephthalate Films via Dual Halide and Low-Dimensional Interface Engineering for Indoor Photovoltaics,” which was recently published in RRL Solar. The research team includes scientists from the University of Guilan in Iran, GreatCell Solar Italia, the Centre for Hybrid and Organic Solar Energy (CHOSE), the Institute of Crystallography (IC-CNR), the Institute of Nanotechnology (CNR NANOTEC), and the University of Salento.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/17/novel-approach-to-identify-possible-silver-shortages-in-pv-industry/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 17, 2023",Novel approach to identify silver shortages in PV industry,"Researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy (Fraunhofer ISE) and the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) in the Netherlands have conducted risk-based due diligence on the silver supply for the PV industry, in order to identify possible shortages in the future.
“Considering the current typical lead times of the mining industry and the constraints such as permitting and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues linked to mine expansion, it is clear that material bottlenecks of unknown duration are in the cards,” researcher Estelle Gervais told pv magazine. “Supply disruptions can therefore be expected for silver, as they can be expected for numerous other materials required in energy technologies, including copper.”
She said that the silver industry has historically been resilient to these challenges because of strategic stocks and recycling, which have played key roles during periods of undersupply over the last 50 years. Silver reserves have also not significantly decreased relative to production over time, which suggests that exhausted reserves have been replenished through mine expansion.
“This is at least a cautiously optimistic sign for the medium to long-term,” said Gervais. “Estimates of future supply are linked to high uncertainty. We could, however, identify concrete risks related to market concentration and ESG issues in silver supply chains, which could translate into supply constraints in the short term. This is especially true for PV markets like the EU and the USA, which are increasingly working towards supply security and sustainability.”
Gervais and her colleagues mapped the solar supply chain of silver from 1995 to 2021 and identified a series of supply patterns and risks. They also analyzed the impact of alternative supply routes and the reshoring PV manufacturing to Europe.
The research group said that most ESG risks from silver paste fabrication are in China, due to its market dominance. The researchers said Mexico and China account for most ESG risks in mining and refining. They also noted the need to prioritize due diligence and traceability with local players, as ESG risk monitoring becomes the norm.
“Reducing silver consumption in PV is crucial, both to alleviate the silver price pain point and reduce the environmental and social impacts along the supply chain,” Gervais said, in reference to the ability of PV producers to reduce silver content in solar cell production – a process referred to as thrifting. “Silver prices are however both a problem and part of the solution. They will play a role in bringing supply and demand into balance, and provide an incentive for PV recycling.”
Gervais said that prolongated periods of silver undersupply could be a clear deterrent for the PV industry and would intensify the focus on substitutes.
“Copper prices make it a great alternative to silver in PV and there have been considerable technological advances in this area,” Gervais added. “Copper contact paste development for screen printing is advancing and industrial manufacturing solutions for copper plating are available. It should nevertheless be underlined that switching from silver to copper will not automatically ensure PV manufacturers have a ‘sustainable' product. Not all copper is created equal: only a careful examination of the underlying copper supply chains and a diversified supply would support that.”
Gervais and her team presented their findings in “Risk-based due diligence in supply chains: The case of silver for photovoltaics,” which was recently published in Resources, Conservation and Recycling.

Germany-based Siemens has revealed plans to add manufacturing capacity in the United States, with a new factory that will produce 800 MW of utility-scale string inverters per yeae from 2024. 
The facility, which will be operated by Siemens’ manufacturing partner, Sanmina, will produce Blueplanet string inverters. Siemens acquired Kaco's inverter business in 2019. At the time of the acquisition, Kaco was already actively producing inverters at the site in Kenosha, Wisconsin. 
Tax credits and demand-side incentives, like the domestic content bonus in the US Inflation Reduction Act, are attracting record levels of clean energy manufacturing to the United States, and the Siemens announcement adds to the growing domestic supply chain. Over the past four years, the German group has invested $3 billion in US manufacturing and other acquisitions. 
“Working with Sanmina to establish this new production line, Siemens is well positioned to address supply challenges our country is facing as we work to localize production for green and renewable infrastructure,” said Brian Dula, vice president of electrification and automation at Siemens Smart Infrastructure USA. 
Kaco Blueplanet inverters range from 110 kW to 165 kW and offer a more modular, transportable option for utility- scale projects than large, containerized central inverters. The inverters are made with a reliable silicon carbide design, are NEMA 4X enclosed, and are compatible with fused, cable-trunking systems, eliminating the need for string-combiner boxes. 
“Single-MPPT inverters are proving to be the preferred choice when it comes to ease of layout and flexibility in design. It is clear that in today’s inverter landscape there is no one multi-MPPT inverter which can provide a satisfactory design for all high-power modules,” said Siemens in a white paper for the inverter. “The Kaco single MPPT string inverter range offers a much easier and more flexible design through the use of DC combiners which is crucial when optimizing your PV module layout.”

Collaborating with a leading technology manufacturer, Task 12 of the International Energy Agency's Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA PVPS) has released a new report, offering a comprehensive environmental life cycle assessment of this innovative PV recycling technique.
Recycling: A Cornerstone of Circular Economy for PV
As the number of decommissioned PV modules increases, the responsible management of end-of-life modules becomes essential to minimize waste and maximize resource recovery. Recycling not only conserves valuable materials but also significantly reduces the industry's environmental footprint, making it a critical driver of sustainable growth.
PV modules are engineered to withstand harsh environmental conditions for decades, showcasing the robustness and longevity of these devices. However, this very durability creates challenges in the recycling process. Among the most formidable obstacles is the intricate task of separating the glass from other layers of the module. Traditional recycling methods often struggle to efficiently and economically delaminate PV modules, necessitating a different approach.
Introducing the Hot Knife Method: A Novel Solution
The Hot Knife method stands out as a cutting-edge and innovative solution to the delamination challenge. By utilizing thermal treatment, this novel technique melts the polymers that bind the glass to the ‘cells/Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA)’ backsheet, facilitating the separation process. Preliminary treatment steps also achieve the removal of the junction box, cables and aluminum frames. The materials that can efficiently be recovered are aluminum and glass sheets, as opposed to contaminated crushed glass, which is the product of other recycling techniques.  Other components sold for further treatment/recovery include the copper cables and cells/EVA backsheets. As a result, the Hot Knife method not only streamlines recycling efforts but also demonstrates the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with recycling.
IEA PVPS Task 12 Collaboration: Assessing the life cycle related environmental impacts
Recycling processes are most valuable if their contribution to the overall system environmental footprint is low. IEA PVPS Task 12, in collaboration with a prominent PV technology manufacturer, embarked on the journey to assess the environmental impact of the Hot Knife method.
The report “Life Cycle Assessment of Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Module Delamination with Hot Knife Technology” delves into the comprehensive scope of life cycle assessment, encompassing all stages of the Hot Knife recycling process. From material extraction to module manufacturing, usage, and eventual recycling, the LCA offers a holistic evaluation of the environmental impacts associated with the Hot Knife method. The environmental impacts caused by the delamination process are attributed to the materials recovered and compared to the environmental impacts caused if these materials were produced from primary resources.
The findings of the report underscore the impressive environmental efficiency of the Hot Knife method. It efficiently recovers aluminum and glass and separates the backsheet (containing cells/Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA)). Based on measured data from the manufacturer, the use of this technology contributes 0.3% or less to the life cycle related environmental footprint of PV electricity in any impact category. Additionally, compared to the environmental impacts of virgin materials, the environmental impacts of recovered materials are lower by 80-98% depending on the impact category. Notably, the recycling process significantly reduces energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and the overall environmental footprint compared to corresponding primary materials. Additionally, the recovery of valuable materials highlights the potential for greater resource efficiency within the PV industry.
Due to the high environmental efficiency, the technology is now being used in one of the largest commercial scale PV recycling facilities in the world (by ENVIE in Saint Loubès, France), as well as some facilities in Japan. Through this early experience, further improvements, such as gains in energy and consumables efficiency are to be expected as this technology is deployed in other applications and upscaled to larger volumes.
Conclusion
As we strive to build a cleaner, greener future, embracing PV recycling emerges as a fundamental pillar in the transition towards a sustainable energy landscape. As proven by the Task 12 report, the Hot Knife method represents an innovative approach to address the challenges of PV module recycling in an environmentally efficient way. Certain aspects however had to be excluded from the Task 12 study due to the lack of available data, including the treatment of copper cables, the treatment of the backsheet and the recovery of copper and silver during these treatments. These processes still need to be added in a future life cycle assessment study.
