RAG said that as part of the commissioning of the world's first 100% hydrogen storage facility in a porous underground reservoir, up to 4.2 GWh of electricity produced in the summer can be kept ready for winter in the form of green hydrogen. Commissioning of the combined heat and power (CHP) plant in the 1 MW range is scheduled for spring 2024. “The hydrogen cogeneration plant is a key building block for the entire hydrogen ramp-up, because flexible, quick-start CHP plants can not only generate electricity as needed, but also produce the heat that is so important in winter,” said Markus Mitteregger, CEO of RAG Austria.
GE Vernova‘s gas power business has secured two orders from EnBW to provide H-Class natural gas-fired combined cycle power generation equipment for EnBW's CHP power stations near Stuttgart. GE Vernova will lead an international consortium for the projects, which includes the EPC companies Bonatti and Sener. “The projects will replace existing coal-fired plants with more efficient natural gas-fired plants while enabling future fuel mix combustion of up to 100% by volume of hydrogen in the 2030s,” said GE Vernova. The two CHP 680 MW power plants, which should be operational by the end of 2026, are expected to deliver nearly 1,340 MW to the national grid, as well as steam for district heating near Stuttgart, Germany. Each plant will be powered by a GE 9HA.01 gas turbine, an STF-D650 steam turbine, a W88 generator, a triple pressure with reheat Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG).
Air Products will build, own, and operate a carbon capture and carbon dioxide (CO2) treatment facility at its existing hydrogen production plant in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The facility should be online in 2026, and the resulting blue hydrogen product will serve ExxonMobil's (Esso) Rotterdam refinery and additional customers via Air Products' hydrogen pipeline network system. “This will be the largest blue hydrogen plant in Europe once operational,” said the US company. The plant will be connected to the Porthos system, “a consortium developing the first large-scale CO2 transport and storage system in the Netherlands which recently reached final investment decision approval.” The captured CO2 will be transported to depleted gas fields in the North Sea, approximately 20 kilometers off the coast, where it will be stored at a depth of more than three kilometers beneath the seabed.
Topsoe, ULC-Energy, and Rolls-Royce SMR have agreed to consider the production of hydrogen based on SOEC technology and electricity and heat from an SMR nuclear power plant. Topsoe will provide its Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) technology, Rolls-Royce SMR will contribute with its knowledge on nuclear Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. “We expect nuclear energy, especially in combination with high-temperature electrolysis, to be able to produce zero-emission hydrogen competitively on a stand-alone basis,” said Dirk Rabelink, CEO of ULC-Energy. “Additional value associated with the operational flexibility will further enhance the business case for this solution.”
KfW Development Bank, a German lender, has entrusted KGAL with the management of the PtX Development Fund. The funds will foster the growth of the green hydrogen value chain in developing and emerging economies.

Longi said its Hi-MO5 panels were used in a 200 MW solar plant at the Yinggehai Salt Field in southern China, specially designed for high salt corrosion environments.
Golden Glass said it has terminated its private placement plan to raise up to CNY 2 billion for capacity expansion, which aimed to add 4.8 GW of cell capacity and 1.2 GW of panel capacity, citing changes in the capital market and related policies.
Trina Solar reported revenues of $11.58 billion in the first three quarters of the year, marking a 31.22% increase compared to the same period last year. The company shipped between 45 GW and 46 GW of modules, along with 5.6 GW of trackers and fixed tilt racks. TrinaTracker's equipment was used in a 17 MW plant connected to the grid in Jiangxi province, China, alongside Trina Solar's 210mm PV modules.
Solar N Plus New Energy has celebrated reaching full production capacity at its tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cell and module plant in Chuzhou, China, with TOPCon cells achieving 26% power conversion efficiency.
Kibing Group has fired up the furnaces of a new glass factory located in Kota Kinabalu Industrial Park, Malaysia, operated by its Malaysian-registered unit, Sabah Kibing Solar New Materials. It completed it in just 17 months, seven months ahead of schedule. The new plant adds capacity to Kibing's six production bases, with 21 float glass lines in central and southern China.

The company said that current measurements account for a milestone achievement, as 17% is the minimum efficiency required by many satellite companies.
“The latest efficiency increase can be attributed to the addition of rubidium fluoride to the chemistry, combined with improvements to Ascent’s manufacturing process,” the company said in a statement. “The improvements will result in an increase in specific power in the space environment from 1,900 W/kg to 2,100 W/kg at air mass zero.”
Ascent Solar added that it will soon release a new CIGS module with this efficiency. The Titan panel is said to be optimized for use in space environments. First orders are expected to be shipped in the first quarter of 2024.
“Titan will be the first standardized product specially designed for space with a specific power of 2,100 W/kg, coupled with best-in-class resilience and flexibility features,” the company said. “The Titan module is approximately one square foot in size, 10 grams in weight, and possesses a target output of 17 W. It can be used alone or configured into an array.”
The company said further enhancements to its CIGS PV technology include the incorporation of Zn(O,S), which is a thin film that can be used as a buffer layer in the cell. It is expected to increase efficiency and power as it expands interactions with light in the blue spectrum and counters degradation after light soak.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/07/china-expected-to-dominate-solar-manufacturing-through-2026/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 7, 2023",China expected to dominate solar manufacturing through 2026,"The recent report “How will China’s expansion affect global solar module supply chains?” finds that China’s policy support for and investment in manufacturing across the solar supply chain will keep the country on top in terms of capacity through 2026.
China has invested an estimated $130 billion into its solar industry this year, according to the Wood Mackenzie report. With more than 1 TW of wafer, cell and module forecast to come online in the next year, China will have enough capacity to meet global demand through 2032, the report says.
“China’s solar manufacturing expansion has been driven by high margins for polysilicon, technology upgrades and policy support,” said Huaiyan Sun, senior consultant at Wood Mackenzie, and author of the report. “And despite strong government initiatives for developing local manufacturing in overseas markets, China will still dominate the global solar supply chain and continue to widen the technology and cost gap with competitors.”
The report forecasts that China will hold more than 80% of the world’s polysilicon, wafer, cell, and module manufacturing capacity from 2023 to 2026. In addition, not only will the country dominate in capacity, its product will come at a lower cost. For example, the report says that a module made in China is half the price of that made in Europe and 65% less than that made in the U.S.
This comes as no surprise because, as noted at the recent pv magazine Roundtables US 2023, building a supply chain takes time. It has been just over a year since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the U.S., which includes $370 billion to support renewable energy build out. Expert panelists noted that they expect the U.S. to be heavy with downstream solar manufacturing, and “we’ll have to continue to rely on imports from foreign partners for polysilicon, ingots and wafers to the U.S.,” said MJ Shiao, vice president of supply chain and manufacturing for the American Clean Power Association. Shiao estimated that it can take from three to five years to build new polysilicon manufacturing.
The buildout of U.S. solar manufacturing will begin with modules, which Shiao said is the smart way to go to ensure that we meet the downstream demand, then start to look for more of the upstream part of the supply chain to meet domestic demand. But upstream manufacturing takes time, the panelists agreed.
“Despite considerable module expansion plans, overseas markets still cannot eliminate their dependence on China for wafers and cells in the next three years,” Sun said.
The U.S. isn’t the only region seeking wafer and cell capacity. As seen in the chart below, Europe and the U.S. both have polysilicon and module capacity, but fall far short in wafers and cell. Southeast Asia, on the other hand, has nearly matched capacity for cells and modules, with India not far behind. But India is also experiencing a strong build out in solar manufacturing, thanks to strong government policy in the form of PLI incentives, and the Wood Mac report forecasts that India will overtake Southeast Asia as the second-largest module production region by 2025.

As other regions are slower to ramp up cell production, China will continue to be the leader in capacity, holding an estimated 17 times more cell capacity than the rest of the world.
However, it is not without its challenges. The report notes that China has recently announced the termination of more than 70 GW in capacity due to oversupply and competition. This mainly concerns old production lines that produce lower efficiency p-type and M6 cells. Wood Mac analysts expect p-type cells to decline to just 17% of supply by 2026.

The company, which runs Britain’s energy systems, said that 19 projects will be offered new connection dates averaging four years earlier than their current agreement.
The new approach removes the need for non-essential engineering works prior to connecting storage and is part of ongoing collaborative industry efforts, together with energy regulator Ofgem and government, to speed up and reform connections.
“We’re committed to speeding up connections and creating a ‘fit for the future’ process for plugging projects into the grid,” says Alice Delahunty, president of National Grid Electricity Transmission.
A further tranche of clean energy projects – primarily batteries and hybrids (batteries co-located with wind or solar) – will be offered accelerated transmission connections as part of another phase anticipated in the new year, which could bring forward another 10 GW, National Grid said on Monday.
The new approach to transmission storage connections – a flagship policy in the Electricity System Operator’s (ESO) five-point plan to speed up connections – comes as National Grid ET undertakes an extensive review of projects in the connections pipeline in England and Wales to identify which can come forward based on new planning assumptions agreed with the ESO.
Traditionally, National Grid carries out network reinforcements before a project plugs in – sometimes adding years to a connection – based on the assumption that batteries could charge at peak times and export when generation is high, exacerbating system peaks and constraints.
Following detailed technical analysis by electricity transmission engineers, National Grid will now offer selected battery projects a transmission connection before network reinforcements are made, on the agreement that the ESO can adjust the battery’s behavior in certain operating conditions to reduce system impact.
ESO released its five-point plan in May with the goal to acclerate connections for 70% of projects due to connect after 2026 by two to 10 years.
“This will speed up connections for up to 95 GW of energy storage projects in the pipeline to ensure system security, they may be instructed to reduce their output, however, only on very rare occasions,” ESO said.
Meanwhile, National Grid is also accelerating connection of low carbon technologies at distribution level. In September, it announced an additional 10 GW of unlocked solar, wind and battery storage capacity on its distribution network in the Midlands, South West of England and South Wales, bringing forward some ‘shovel ready’ schemes by up to five years.
National Grid has already been in contact with more than 200 projects interested in fast tracking their distribution connection dates in the first wave of the capacity release, with 16 expressing an interest in connecting in the next 12 months and another 180 looking to connect within two to five years.
A second expression of interest is being rolled out to the next group of customers, coupled with plans to replace the ‘first come, first served’ distribution connections process with a more dynamic ‘first ready, first connected’ approach.
“We’re delighted that so many customers have already expressed an interest in taking advantage of this additional capacity to accelerate the connection dates for their low carbon technologies,” says Cordi O’Hara, president of National Grid Electricity Distribution. “But we’re not stopping there. Our second expression of interest will extend the offer to even more customers who will be able to benefit from our more agile approach to connections, enabling the UK to install the renewable generation needed to decarbonize the electricity system by 2035.”

In September 2021, SunDrive said it had achieved a record-breaking power conversion efficiency of 25.54% for a silver-free heterojunction (HJT) solar cell. The breakthrough attracted financial support from some of Australia’s most prominent renewable investors.
Last week, ARENA announced a further AUD 11 million ($7.06 million) for SunDrive to expand its novel solar cell metallisation technology from prototype scale (that is, less than 1.5 MW of annual production) to commercial-scale capacity of more than 100 MW of metallised PV cell production annually. That is enough for around 15,000 household solar systems each year.
Little information on timelines is provided, but SunDrive did say it is aiming to employ around 100 people by the end of the year at their manufacturing facility in Sydney. However, the eventual aim is to grow this to more than 500 staff as production increases in Australia.
Overall, SunDrive’s scale up is expected to cost a total of AUD 33.6 million.
SunDrive’s CEO Vince Allen started the company with David Hu in 2015, based on a solution developed while completing his PhD at the University of New South Wales (UNSW).
SunDrive’s breakthrough rests on cell metallization technology that uses copper instead of silver in solar cells. Copper is approximately 100 times cheaper and 1000 time more abundant than the silver currently being used in solar manufacturing, meaning the technology holds massive promise for pushing down solar prices, improving the environmental impacts of solar manufacturing, and helping to rapidly scale up manufacturing globally.

Portuguese police today raided the official residence of Prime Minister António Costa as part of a corruption investigation involving renewable energy.
Police also searched the homes of the Minister of Climate Action, Duarte Cordeiro, and Minister of Infrastructure, João Pedro Matos Fernándey. Cordeiro, Fernández and Cordeiro's predecessor, João Galamba, have been declared formal suspects.
Police detained the prime minister's chief of staff, Vítor Escária, as well as his consultant, Lacerda Machado, according to local Portuguese media. The mayor of Sines, Nuno Mascarenhas, has also been detained.
The police searched more than 40 residencies with over 140 officers involved.
According to investigators, it is alleged the Portuguese government may have favored Portuguese companies for lithium exploitation projects in Montealegre, in the north of Portugal, and for green hydrogen production in Sines, in the country's west.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/07/europe-should-produce-its-own-green-hydrogen/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,EUROPE,NORTHERN AFRICA",,"NOVEMBER 7, 2023",Europe should produce its own green hydrogen,"In recent years, the idea of importing green hydrogen from North Africa has surfaced as a potential avenue to bolster Europe’s clean energy mix. Much of this was driven by the idea that the processes of both producing green energy, and converting it to hydrogen, were prohibitively expensive in Europe. For many in Europe, the focus quickly shifted to countries where producing renewables would be cheaper than at home.
Image: Lhyfe
The arid expanses of North Africa offer abundant sunlight and vast tracts of land to house solar installations, driving down one of the main costs of producing renewable hydrogen. Falling European solar and wind costs, however, along with the benefits of not needing to transport green hydrogen long distances, actually paint a much more positive picture of producing the energy carrier domestically, in Europe. With green energy costs expected to sink below €0.02 ($0.02)/kWh by 2038, the cost benefit currently attributed to North Africa should fade in a major way.
Understandably, cost dynamics play a pivotal role in the green hydrogen business case but energy production contributes only part of the final cost. The expense associated with shipping hydrogen over long distances could significantly hinder its economic viability. Transporting hydrogen from North Africa to European shores entails a complex, energy-intensive process, whether via pipelines or ships. Shipping alone could increase the average end price by a staggering 50-150%. This logistical hurdle not only drives up costs but also increases the carbon footprint of green hydrogen, tarnishing its clean energy credentials. Add in the geopolitical risks associated with importing green hydrogen and its perceived benefits fade quickly.
On the other hand, locally generated green hydrogen, in Europe, has a number of distinct advantages. For one, a Europeanwide network of pipelines is currently being developed to support the cost effective rollout of green hydrogen. Immediate proximity to the market not only slashes transportation costs but also enhances demand responsiveness, a crucial factor in the evolving energy landscape and one which contributes to the very important issue of European energy security. Moreover, local production stimulates economic growth, creating jobs, and fostering a self-sufficient energy ecosystem.
Environmentally, the case for local production is equally as compelling. Europe has been making significant strides in harnessing renewable energy in recent years, with a rapidly expanding network of solar and wind installations. These renewables resources are instrumental in powering electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen, ensuring a low-carbon production process. Additionally, advancements in technology will continue to drive down the cost of green hydrogen production in Europe, making it an increasingly competitive option.
Investing in local green hydrogen production also augments Europe’s energy security. Relying on imports, particularly from politically volatile regions, could jeopardize the steady supply of green hydrogen. That is a risk that could be mitigated by domestic production. The extremely difficult energy challenges that sprung from the war in Ukraine should ensure that the importance of this factor is not overlooked in the near future.
Lastly, nurturing a robust local green hydrogen industry can position Europe as a global leader in clean energy technology. Although the continent still remains an important R&D hub for much technology, it has ceded a large slice of green energy production to third countries, particularly China. European green hydrogen would not only showcase the region’s commitment to combating climate change but also set a precedent for other markets to follow suit, hopefully providing a blueprint for a more decentralized global energy system.
One question that remains, and which represents a significant hurdle to securing widespread funding and support for European green hydrogen, is identifying and proving initial customers for the energy carrier. Thankfully, this has already been a key topic for many of the companies pioneering the European green hydrogen market. The initial targets for hydrogen producers are industrial players which can realize significant sustainability gains through a switch to the green energy carrier. Steel and glass are two particularly fitting heavy industries.
Beyond those heavy emitters, which, due to their immense heat demands, can represent a cumbersome switch, there are many applications that can easily be converted to green hydrogen without much effort. These include the chemical industry, where green hydrogen can simply replace fossil fuel derived “grey” hydrogen; and powering industrial vehicles such as forklifts, at logistics depots, and delivery trucks for commercial fleets.
While North Africa may promise a wealth of cheap green energy, it is becoming clear that the profitability, as well as the environmental sustainability, of importing green hydrogen across the Mediterranean is quickly fading. As regulations such as the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) come into effect, we should see a distinct rebalancing in terms of what will best contribute to Europe’s green ambitions. From 2026 onwards, H2 and its derivate products will need to fully report and pay into the CBAM.
Perhaps North Africa’s ambitious green hydrogen plans can be better applied to the region's own expansion aims rather than being used as a crutch for a European industrial sector that is apprehensive about pushing the innovation agenda on its own shores.
With the cost of producing this important material here in Europe continually sinking, now is the time to position domestic suppliers to scale the technology at the earliest chance they can get. Europe has the opportunity to once again take a leadership role in a vital sector of our future energy system. This will rely on regulators and industry leaders aligning on a path forward – something which is easier said than done.
The global green hydrogen rollout is still in its early days and Europe should take this opportunity to jump in and help shape this industry of the future. The long term benefits of opting for a domestic green hydrogen industry, rather than relying once again on energy imports, will be far reaching and will help Europe make a strong push to re-establish itself as a major industrial player on the world stage.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/07/overview-of-grid-codes-identifies-cei-0-21-standard-as-potential-international-benchmark/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 7, 2023",Overview of grid codes identifies CEI 0–21 standard as potential international benchmark,"Scientists at the National Research Council of Italy (CNR) have conducted a comprehensive overview of grid codes, inverter topologies, and control techniques in nine different countries in an effort to identify the most urgent challenges and concerns that their respective energy markets have to address in order to integrate higher shares of solar and renewable energies.
“The main contribution of this paper consists in gathering new, innovative, and cutting-edge solutions that handle all facets of PV system design, from standard compliance to circuit implementation,” the researchers stated in the study “Grid-connected photovoltaic inverters: Grid codes, topologies and control techniques,” published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. “These elements are all intimately connected. The proposed comprehensive research and study may help operators, technicians, and academics gain a thorough understanding of the most important issues and challenges.”
The research group evaluated and compared, in particular, different standards for the grid connection of PV systems in different countries.
The analysis included the IEC 61727 international standard, the US EREC G83/2 Recommendations, Germany's VDE-AR-N 4105 standard, China's GB/T 19964-2012 and the GB/T 20,046 standards, as well as Italy's CEI 0-21 standard. It also comprised Australia's AS 4777.2 and New Zealand's AS 4777.2 standards, as well as the United States' IEEE 1547 standards.
The scientists said this comparison showed that different curves have to be implemented for each of the standards, which they said has a direct influence on the control system implementation. “Different curves correspond to different curves parameters and time thresholds,” they stated. “This mostly affects control parameters, rather than the choice of a specific control system.”
The academics stressed the importance of developing common rules, new inverter topologies, and control methods in order to reach a higher degree of harmonization between different countries. This would enable an easier exchange of services between them, while providing opportunities to develop common communication protocols.
The research team identified the CEI 0–21 standard as a useful reference, as it is the only standard that considers the need to establish a communication protocol.
This standard has several intervention thresholds for frequency and voltage and can be implemented in agreement with the grid operator. It also includes a different feature with respect to other standard requirements, which consists of disconnecting the solar plant in the case of islanding conditions.
“In this case the trip time is disabled and the yellow zone can be considered as a normal working zone. The different frequency ranges have an influence on the control system implementation,” the scientist stated. “In this regard, the CEI 0–21 is a useful reference since it emphasizes the need of using a communication protocol.”

Genex Power has revealed that a recent battery fire in Queensland initially occurred on the AC side. It said that the fault then propagated to the battery modules. The company nonetheless expects the battery to complete commissioning and commence operations by mid-November.
“The failure has been isolated to the power electronics interface with the AC bus bar in the individual Megapack unit itself and not the broader installation of Megapack units,” the company said in the update.
The Bouldercombe battery, which sits roughly 20 kilometers south of Rockhampton, Queensland, was in the middle of the commissioning process when the fire broke out. The AUD 60 million ($38.5 million) project is Genex’s first foray into big batteries.
Genex has been working with Tesla Motors Australia to investigate the incident, with Tesla undertaking preliminary analysis via remote diagnostics since the time of the event. On Oct. 13, the affected Megapack was transported to a testing facility in Melbourne to complete further analysis via physical inspection. The full root cause analysis (RCA) into the fire is expected to be made public by Tesla “when finalized.”

Most major European markets recorded less solar energy production in the week of Oct. 30 compared to the week prior. This is unsurprising as the fall progresses and the days are getting shorter. Compared to the major European markets, Spain's solar energy production dropped the most by 14%. The German market registered the smallest decline with 2.4%. The exception was the Portuguese market as solar energy production grew by 8.6%.
According to projections by AleaSoft Energy Forecasting, solar energy production will increase in Germany, Spain and Italy in the week of Nov. 6.


Wind energy production offset solar energy production losses in the week of Oct. 30. All major European markets recorded an increase in wind energy generation in the week of Oct. 30 compared to the previous seven days. Spain was the exception, however, as wind energy production was high, but there was almost no difference in the week-on-week total.
Germany's wind energy generation increased the most with 67% and Portugal grew the least at 12%. The Italian market set a record high by generating 846 GWh of wind during the first week of November. Portugal ended the week generating a total of 567 GWh, which is the second-highest volume after the country recorded 587 GWh of wind generation on Feb. 8, 2016.
Wind energy production will decrease in all analyzed markets in the week of Nov. 6, according to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s wind energy production forecasts.

Electricity demand
Most major European markets saw less electricity demand in the week of Oct. 30 compared to the previous week. All Saints’ Day on Nov. 1 was celebrated in most of Europe – except Great Britain – which contributed to declining demand. The Italian market dropped the most with 8.5%, while Spain dropped the least with 1.2%. Only France and Great Britain registered an increase in electricity demand with 2.5% and 2.2%, respectively.
During the same period, average temperatures slid in all analyzed markets, except in the Netherlands. These decreases ranged from 2.0 C in France to 0.5 C in Belgium.
Demand will increase in all analyzed markets in the week of Nov. 6 compared to the previous week, according to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s demand forecasts.

European electricity markets
Europe's main electricity market prices fell in the week of Oct. 30 compared to the previous week. The MIBEL market of Spain and Portugal dropped by 59% and 61%, respectively. The N2EX market of the United Kingdom decreased the least by 9.1%. In the other markets, prices fell, such as 27% in Italy's IPEX market to 39% in Germany's EPEX SPOT market.
Most analyzed European electricity markets recorded weekly averages below €70/MWh in the first week of November. The Italian and British markets were the exceptions, where prices averaged €95.72/MWh and €99.08/MWh, respectively.
The Portuguese and Spanish markets registered the lowest average prices of €21.77/MWh and €23.02/MWh, respectively. In the other remaining markets, prices ranged from €42.87/MWh in the Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries to €66.77/MWh in the Dutch market.
The MIBEL market recorded the lowest hourly prices in the first week of November. This market registered 19 hours of €0.00/MWh from Nov. 3 to 5. The MIBEL market also recorded the lowest daily prices of the main European markets from Oct. 26 to Nov. 6, except for Oct. 31.
The Italian market registered a minimum hourly price of €2.46/MWh. This price, registered from 14:00 to 15:00 on Nov. 5, was Italy's lowest since May. The Nordic market recorded €142.69/MWh from 18:00 to 19:00 on Nov. 6, which is the highest price since April.
Falling gas prices and CO2 emission rights, declining market demand, and increased wind energy generation led to lower prices in European electricity markets during the week of Oct. 30. Solar energy production increased in Portugal, which contributed to the country registering the lowest weekly average.
According to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s price forecasts, prices will increase in most European electricity markets analyzed in the second week of November. An increase in demand and a decrease in wind energy production will influence this behavior.

Brent, fuels and CO2
The ICE market, Brent oil futures for the Front‑Month registered their weekly maximum settlement price of $87.45/bbl on Oct. 30. This price was 2.6% lower than the previous Monday. On Wednesday, Nov. 1, they registered their weekly minimum settlement price of $84.63/bbl. This price was 6.1% lower than the previous Wednesday. Despite recovering slightly on Thursday, in the last session of the first week of November settlement price fell below $85/bbl again to reach $84.89/bbl. This price was 6.2% lower than the previous Friday.
During the first week of November, prices fell due to diminishing fears that the conflict in the Middle East would affect supply. At the beginning of the folllwing week, confirmation that Russia and Saudi Arabia will maintain planned production cuts until the end of 2023 influenced Brent oil futures prices upwards.
As for TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front‑Month, on Monday, October 30, settlement prices reached their weekly maximum, reaching €50.55/MWh. For the rest of the week, settlement prices remained below €50/MWh. On November 1, settlement prices reached their weekly minimum, €47.76/MWh. This price was 4.3% lower than the previous Wednesday.
Higher than usual temperatures for the season and high levels of European reserves kept prices below €50/MWh in the first week of November. In addition, Israel resumed its gas exports to Egypt, which also led to a downward influence on prices.
Settlement prices of CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of Dec. 2023 remained below €80/t during the first week of November. On Wednesday, Nov. 1, these futures reached their weekly maximum settlement price, reaching €79.51/t. Prices declined on Thursday and Friday, which resulted in a settlement price on Friday, Nov. 3, of €77.65/t, the weekly minimum This price was 2.1% less than the same day of the previous week and the lowest since mid‑January.

The NZE parameter refers to the balance between the amount of greenhouse gas generated and the amount that is removed from the atmosphere.
The scientists used HOMER optimization software to simulate the technological and economic needs of a remote in Sindh province, Pakistan.
“Sindh, characterized by its arid climate and challenging socio-economic conditions, presents unique obstacles to achieving NZE villages,” they said. “Hence, simulation-based extensive research is required to evaluate the solar power potential and to examine the economic viability.”
The academics chose the small village of Burriro in Jacobabad district. It includes eight houses and three stores, along with a small medical center, school, mosque, and community center.
The scientists estimated the village's daily electricity load at 64.259 kWh and the peak load at 9.05 kW, using the Global Solar Atlas to determine solar irradiance, which was measured at 6.16 kWh/m2 per day.
Considering the tradeoff between PV module efficiency and price, the researchers conducted their simulation assuming the use of  350W monocrystalline solar panels with a combined capacity of 18.4 kW. To that, they added a 10.7 kW inverter and lithium-ion batteries with a usable capacity of 98.4 kWh.
They also considered a discount rate of 15% and found the off-grid system can be deployed with an initial capital investment of $ 434,000 and a total net present cost (NPC) of $ 511,000. The NPC defines the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a given period of time.
“The proposed system provides electricity to consumers in remote areas at a unit cost price of $2.26,” the researchers stated. “The standalone renewable system generates about 30,078 kWh/year, with the excess electricity generation of 4,072 kWh/year which enables the studied area to be self-sufficient and independent of the grid.”
The payback period for the proposed system is 7.2 years.
“The findings and conclusions may not be directly applicable to other regions with different climate conditions or resource availability,” the scientists said.
The academics presented their findings in “Building Resilient communities: Techno-economic assessment of standalone off-grid PV powered net zero energy (NZE) villages,” which was recently published in Heliyon.
The research team includes scientists from Iran's Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Tun Hussein Onn University of Malaysia, Thailand’s Prince of Songkla University and University Hat Yai, and Saudi Arabia’s King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/07/novel-architecture-for-heterojunction-copper-bismuth-oxide-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BANGLADESH",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 7, 2023",Novel architecture for heterojunction copper bismuth oxide solar cells,"Researchers at the Pabna University of Science and Technology, in Bangladesh, have developed a new architecture for thin-film solar cells based on copper bismuth oxide (CuBi2O4).
CuBi2O4 is an abundant, inexpensive, and harmless p-type semiconductor that has been recently identified as a photocathode with a two-dimensional porous heterojunction structure. “CuBi2O4 thin films can be fabricated based on the solution process by using a simple and low-cost spin coating technique,” research co-author, Sheikh Rashel Al Ahmed, told pv magazine. “This material also has several advantages such as suitable bandgap, minimal toxicity, chemical stability, abundant organic compounds, and affordable processing.”
In the paper “Design and simulation of a highly efficient CuBi2O4 thin-film solar cell with hole transport layer,” published in Optics & Laser Technology, Al Ahmed and his group used the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, developed by the University of Ghent, to simulate a novel cell configuration based on various hole transport layers (HTLs). The same research group unveiled in 2021 a heterojunction design for CuBi2O4 that didn't consider the use of an HTL.
The new cell developed by the scientists is based on a glass substrate coated with molybdenum (Mo), and HTL made of copper(I) oxide (Cu2O), the CuBi2O4 absorber, a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) layer, and an aluminum (Al) metal contact. The academics inserted the HTL at the rear side of the absorber.
“The inclusion of HTL may improve the carrier gathering by the electrodes,” the researchers stated. “In addition, holes enter the contact layer as electrons are effectively returned to the n-type space charge area. As a result, in the p-type area, the minority carrier recombination loss diminishes.”
The group conducted a computational analysis to assess the effect of the absorber bulk defects on the cell performance.
The simulated cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 29.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.02 V, a short-circuit current density of 32.49 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 87.91%.
“The addition of HTL was effective in decreasing the absorber thickness in the solar cell with significant PV performances by minimizing the carrier recombination loss at the back surface,” Al Ahmed said. “Thus, the thinner absorber layer in the solar cells allows to reduce the required amounts of raw material and hence reduces the total manufacturing cost of the thinner CuBi2O4 TFSC with the introduction of Cu2O HTL.”
“The entire evaluation process with the present approach will give important evidence of design complexity in the solar cells for the scientists, consequently decreasing the fabrication cost, time, and difficulty considerably,” he concluded.

NREL, in collaboration with the Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO), recently released its US Solar Photovoltaic System and Energy Storage Cost Benchmarks, With Minimum Sustainable Price Analysis: Q1 2023.
This year’s analysis indicates a contrasting trend: While utility-scale solar project costs are on the rise, residential project expenses are decreasing. An 8% increase in utility-scale costs can be attributed to rising labor expenses, which have been influenced by the IRA's implementation of new prevailing wage requirements tied to a 30% tax credit. Conversely, residential solar benefitted from reduced prices in modules, inverters, logistics, and customer acquisition, resulting in a 16% overall decrease in residential costs despite rising financing expenses.
For 2023, NREL has refined its cost-modeling methodology by integrating feedback from industry stakeholders and updating its economic assessments to reflect the IRA’s impact on labor and hardware expenses. The analysis now also includes the effects of rising interest rates, which have become a more prominent cost factor than in prior years.
The report also reveals that while US module prices decreased from 2022, module prices are still a bit higher than they were in 2021. Commodity market prices for copper and other metals have settled near their 2021 levels, reducing this year’s costs for racking, and for the electrical balance of system. However, with the Consumer Price Index signaling a 15% inflation increase during the covered period, inflation remains a substantial factor in cost increases.
The November issue of pv magazine, due out Thursday, is dominated by the issue of global oversupply and examines the effects of a solar glut in the European Union, the United States, and other markets. We turn the spotlight on PV developments in South Korea, Taiwan, and Africa and update readers on technological progress in thin films, kerfless wafering, and mass produced heterojunction PV.
