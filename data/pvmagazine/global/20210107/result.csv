This work comes just weeks after the efficiency record was pushed to 29.52% by Oxford PV, which is developing industrial processes for tandem cell production at a pilot line in Germany.
The group, also including scientists from McMaster University in Canada, finds that several challenges remain to demonstrate long term stability for perovskites, able to match the 30 years plus lifetime expectation now required for market entry. These challenges, however, should soon be surmountable.
Promising approach
“We believe that the commercialization of PVSK/Si tandem, which provides one of the most promising approaches to producing cheaper solar electricity, can be achieved in the near future.” This is the conclusion of an exhaustive review of the materials, cell designs and cost potential the has gone into tandem cell technology in recent years, published in the journal Frontiers in Chemistry.
The paper finds that perovskite solar cells in combination with most available silicon designs (PERC, PERx, TOPCon, heterojunction and interdigitated back contact), promise around a 5% absolute efficiency increase, which will be economically attractive in most cases. “In the viewpoint of the c-Si solar cells, the PVSK/Si tandem devices provide an alternative route that is incremental rather than disruptive,” the researchers state.
Similar to recent work published by Fraunhofer ISE, they note that while much research has focused on higher efficiency HJT or TOPCon cells, the sheer size of the PERC cell production industry means it cannot be ignored. “PERX family cells are worthy of investigation due to their predominant market share, which indicates strong motivation for the producers for further improvement by coupling with perovskite cells.”
And in terms of challenges, they find that encapsulation strategies for tandem cells still require a lot of work, and that the research community should focus on working with large scale devices, and collaborating on demonstration of stability. “Standards for testing stability are needed, and the corresponding studies should report stability data exhaustively,” the group concludes. “Once this has been accomplished, PVSK/Si tandems will be poised to be commercialized rapidly, benefiting from a partnership with the existing c-Si industry.”

The latest round of the Batterifondsprogrammet, or Battery Fund, will give particular emphasis to projects examining the production, use, reuse, collection and recycling of batteries; resource efficiency, including eco-design and circular manufacturing; safety through all aspects of the battery supply chain and product life cycle; global battery use; improving the competitiveness of the Swedish battery industry; modelling cell and battery pack use; raising the number of battery-related PhD studies; labeling; stationary storage; supercapacitors; battery diagnostics; logistics; and security.
Circular manufacturing was the focus of the UP initiative in Q3. We looked at whether adopting circular approaches could create a competitive edge and offer financial and reputational rewards. We also investigated what is already being done in the solar industry. Peruse our coverage here.
Projects studying the deployment of already commercially-available technology will not be eligible for funding, the energy authority stressed, in an announcement on its website in December.
Successful applicants will receive funding from the proceeds of a charge applied to battery sales before 2009, levied to finance battery collection and reuse. Since 2009, battery manufacturers have been responsible for such operations.
The current, ten-year, second phase of the Battery Fund is set to disburse around SEK280 million via annual calls until 2028.
Funding decisions have been promised by May and eligible research projects must not begin before that point.

“Both industrial and general consumers of electricity can participate in the K-RE100 system through registration at the state-run Korea Energy Agency. Electricity from renewable sources will be procured through the green premium system … third-party power purchase agreement[s] (PPA), the purchase of renewable energy certificates (REC), or self-generation,” MOTIE said in a statement.
The K-RE100 initiative is aimed at making South Korea fully powered by renewable energy by 2050. The new rules are expected to be defined in the upcoming weeks and should enter into force “early this year,” the government said.
Currently, Korean consumers can buy electricity exclusively from state-owned utility Korea Electric Power Corp (Kepco), which collects all power produced in the country from energy providers and independent power producers. According to local media outlet The Korea Times, however, Kepco is expected to act as an intermediary between the seller and the buyer. “The revision allows renewable power companies whose generation capacity exceeds 1 MW to sign a trilateral supply agreement with Kepco and the consumer, so Kepco can relay the power transaction,” the newspaper reported.

The compound, known as C12H12Br2N2, was used as a donor molecular dopant in two unspecified organic PV devices with efficiencies of 16.7%. In one of the two cells, the efficiency was raised to 17.4%, while in the second device it reached 18.3%.
“These improvements were possible because the molecular diquat dopant increased both the materials' optical absorption and the lifetime of the electrical charges when light was absorbed,” the academics said.
They explained that this particular dopant had never been used in previous research, due to its lack of stability in an ambient atmosphere. Their major achievement consists of developing a process that purportedly created a stable neutral diquat by electrochemically reducing charged diquat, which is stable in air.
“This ability makes diquat a promising choice for the next generation of organic solar cells,” said researcher Yuanbao Lin, adding that efficiencies of around 20% could be achieved with the new technique.
In 2019, another research team at the university developed a highly performant organic PV cell using tungsten disulfide flakes with a thickness of a few atoms. The process created for the cell reportedly led to the production of an organic cell with a conversion efficiency of 17% – a figure that was said to be the highest for an organic cell based on a 2D material as a hole transporter, and among the highest for organic PV in general.
“Our immediate goal is to push the efficiency of our organic solar cells well beyond 17% and toward our theoretically predicted limits,” researcher Thomas Anthopoulos said at the time.

Eon announced, on Wednesday, it agreed to acquire a 49% stake in Eco2solar, a British provider of rooftop photovoltaic solutions.
The company, which works with many major building developers in the U.K., was founded in 2008 and has already installed more than 20,000 PV systems on different kinds of buildings including schools, hospitals, universities and distribution centers. In addition, the company offers battery storage and charging stations for electric vehicles for building developers that are active in social housing and the commercial sector. The cooperation with Eon is expected to sustain Eco2solar's further growth in the UK market.
“Eco2solar will continue to operate independently and our focus will remain the same: installing solar systems, battery storage and other smart technologies for the new construction market across the U.K.,” said Paul Hutchens, CEO of Eco2solar.
Eon said that Great Britain is an interesting future market, especially since the country has set itself ambitious zero emissions targets. “The houses we live in now and the houses we will build in the future are key to achieving these goals,” said Michael Lewis, Eon's U.K. director. After all, the housing sector is the second largest cause of CO2 emissions in Great Britain.
Eco2solar claims to be well equipped to support building owners with their sustainability goals. “They are a great fit with what we are trying to achieve for our millions of customers across Eon; making energy smart, personalized and sustainable in their homes, businesses and across entire communities,” said Lewis.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/07/indian-reliance-on-polysilicon-solar-production-leaves-it-trailing-china/,"COVID-19,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,INDIA",MAX HALL,"JANUARY 7, 2021",Indian reliance on polycrystalline tech production leaves it trailing China,"As PV superpower China shifts ever more output towards higher-efficiency monocrystalline silicon solar products, around 87% of India's fabs were still geared towards polycrystalline products in 2019, according to a report on the challenges facing Indian manufacturers.
The Viability Assessment of New Domestic Solar Module Manufacturing Units report, published by Haryana-based sustainable industry consultant JMK Research and U.S. research body the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), has fleshed out how much Indian solar manufacturers trail their Chinese counterparts.
The authors of the study urged the Indian government to widen its domestic manufacturing policy beyond solar cells and modules and to establish supply chain manufacturing of silicon ingots, wafers and cells. With state authorities told to do more to allocate land and speed up factory permitting, the study also emphasized the need for the federal government to drive the same level of solar R&D efforts as have been seen in China.
“Clear political intent along with a long-term vision is what is now needed for this sector to take off,” concluded the study, which exposed the latest problems to dog a problematic, painfully drawn-out manufacturing-linked solar tender as it surveyed the reasons India has fallen so far behind the country which supplies 80% of the imported cells and modules it has paid around INR176 billion ($2.4 billion) per year for since 2015.
The manufacturing tender launched by state body the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) in May 2018 is emblematic of the problems the government has faced in attempting to establish a domestic industry to compete with China. Originally envisioned as offering solar developers 10 GW of solar project generation capacity if they agreed to establish ingot, wafer, cell and module production lines with 5 GW of annual manufacturing capacity, the tender suffered numerous deadline extensions and downward revisions of scale which demanded ever smaller fabs in return for the project capacity.
Ultimately, Adani Solar agreed to establish 2 GW of module production lines in return for 8 GW of project capacity and Azure Power agreed a ratio of 1 GW production for 4 GW of projects. The IEEFA-JMK Research study stated, however, a six-month delay by SECI in issuing letters of award for the factories saw solar costs fall so much the tendering body has been unable to persuade state electricity distribution companies (discoms) to agree to purchase the power generated by the 12 GW of project capacity at the agreed rate of INR2.92/kWh ($0.04). That is a figure, according to the report, “which the discoms now consider too high, particularly in light of Covid-19 demand disruption over 2020.”
The national body, says the report, has been forced to water down the price by bundling it with two other SECI tenders, signed off for 1.2 GW in February at INR2.50-2.51/kWh and for 2 GW in June, at INR2.36-2.38, for an average of around INR2.66/kWh, by pv magazine‘s calculation. With recent Indian tenders producing tariffs as low as INR1.99, the report continued, “there's a likely chance of further delay and reluctance from discoms” and “a downward re-pricing is likely.”
The manufacturing tender is just one of the policy initiatives which has failed to help Indian solar producers keep pace with Chinese rivals, along with domestic content requirements on PV projects, successfully challenged by the U.S. at the World Trade Organization; various subsidies; and the imposition of a safeguarding duty to protect Indian industry.
The report highlights the lack of R&D spending by India's biggest solar manufacturers. With the Chinese giants investing around 1-3% of their gross annual revenue on improving efficiency – the widespread shift to mono-grade polysilicon and use of larger wafers being a case in point – the result is, according to the study that “India has been a laggard in transitioning towards development of the latest cell technology.” That means Indian “module suppliers prefer the superior imported cells.”
A report which states at its outset that India has to consider its industrial base given the “reformed national priorities following the Covid-19 pandemic and India-China border issues,” similarly does not pull its punches when listing the government-granted advantages Chinese solar manufacturers enjoy. Those include, according to the study, “confiscating land from urban residents and villagers” to award it free of charge to manufacturers, as well as fully integrated solar supply chains backed by public money, cheap finance and supportive industrial strategy.
China, noted the report, in addition to housing 71% of the world's solar panel production in 2019, also had 97% of global wafer output, 79% of cell manufacturing and produced 67% of the world's polysilicon. The resulting freedom from imported materials offers Chinese producers a huge cost advantage over their Indian peers, who accounted for just 1% of global module production in 2019, according to the study, and who used only 40-45% of their estimated 15 GW of module production lines during the year.
There are crumbs of comfort in the study, which cited a report in Indian business newspaper The Financial Express which stated Indian solar developers had started to look closer to home after Chinese solar manufacturers attempted to capitalize on Covid-related module price rises of up to 20% last year by renegotiating the terms of previously-signed supply contracts.
The IEEFA-JMK Research publication noted the expansion plans of Adani, which plans to add 2-2.5 GW of cell and module production lines this year; Vikram Solar, which in July committed to a INR54billion, 3 GW wafer, cell and module facility in Tamil Nadu; Waaree, which is planning 3 GW more module output; and a 500 MW module fab planned jointly by Azure and Waaree to fulfil those manufacturing-linked-tender requirements. Renewsys intends to add 420 MW of cell and 1 GW of module capacity, according to the report; Jupiter Solar was set to commission 200 MW of new cell capacity by the close of 2020 and even state-owned Coal India Ltd was reportedly ready to get in on the act, with what would be a vast “Rs45,500 crore” ($6.2 billion) wafer fab.
In terms of policy, the report noted the 14.9% safeguarding duty applied to cells and modules from China, Thailand and Vietnam will fall to 14.5% from January 29 and expire on July 29. The IEEFA and JMK Research analysts applaud the decision by the finance ministry to replace the safeguarding tariff with a 40% basic customs duty on imported modules and a 25% charge on cells from April 2022 but stress such protectionist moves will be no more than a sticking plaster if the more critical questions of R&D spend and establishing supply chains are not addressed.
In that respect, stated the report, moves by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy to exempt solar production equipment from the basic customs duty and, with the involvement of the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, to allocate land for solar production facilities near ports, should be welcomed as a step in the right direction.

The fully transparent solar cell is based on a titanium dioxide (TiO2) layer used as a UV light absorber and a Nickel(II) oxide (NiO) layer deposited for high transmittance for visible light. “The p-type semiconductor NiO serves as the heterojunction counterpart to n-type TiO2,” the researchers explained.
The device was built with a glass substrate, a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) film – on top of which the two layers were deposited – and a coating of silver nanowire. “The FTO and silver nanowires (AgNWs) serve as the bottom and the top electrodes for collecting photo-generated carriers, respectively,” the Korean group specified, adding that the p-n heterostructure-based TiO2 can also separate the photogenerated charges by the internal electric field at junction interface, resulting in self-powered operation.
The measurements taken by the scientists showed that the integrated PV device is able to produce electric power with a conversion efficiency of 2.1%, with more than 57% of visible light being transmitted through the cell's layers. “By UV illumination, the transparent solar cell generated power to move a motor (0.2 V and 10 mA),” they specified. “This clearly suggests the transparent solar cell would serve as an invisible power generator.”
The low-cost cell may be suitable for various applications in many electronic devices. “While this innovative solar cell is still very much in its infancy, our results strongly suggest that further improvement is possible for transparent photovoltaics by optimizing the cell's optical and electrical properties,” said research co-author Joondong Kim.
The solar cell was described in the study Transparent photovoltaic cells and self-powered photodetectors by TiO2/NiO heterojunction, published in the Journal of Power Sources.

There are two versions of the product, with 225 kW and 250 kW nominal output power and European efficiency ratings ranging from 98.4% to 99.6%. The efficiency of both devices is 99%.
The inverters measure 1,091x678x341mm and weigh 105kg. They have 12 maximum power point tracking (MPPT) channels and 24 string inputs. The smaller device, called GW225K-HT, has a maximum output power (AC) of 247.5 kW and a maximum output current of 187.7 A. These values for the largest inverter – the GW250K-HT – are 250 kW and 180.5 A, respectively.
MPPT voltage for both products ranges from 500 V to 1,500 V while their ambient operating temperature is comprised between -30 degrees Celsius to 60 degrees Celsius. The inverters can operate at an altitude of up to 4,000m.
The inverters also feature IP66 protection and a temperature-controlled fan for cooling, “These inverters boast 12 MPPTs, PLC communication and are compatible with bifacial modules,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The HT-1500V Series features string-level monitoring incorporated, for intelligent detection of voltage and current issues.”
The series includes optional AC terminal over-temperature protection, designed to send alarms if the temperature of the terminals approach dangerously high levels. It also features an optional anti-PID function. “The configuration of the HT 1500V can be easily done via Bluetooth, and the diagnosis and the upgrading of the firmware may be operated remotely,” the manufacturer added. “These outstanding sets of features were conceived to ensure the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE).”
With this new inverter series, GoodWe has made its first step into the large scale PV business.

Using land for both solar photovoltaic power and agriculture could provide 20% of total electricity generation in the United States, according to a new paper by Oregon State University researchers.
Wide-scale installations of agrivoltaic systems could lead to an annual reduction of 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States, while “minimally” affecting crop yields, the researchers said.
Agrivoltaics provide a “rare chance for true synergy: more food, more energy, lower water demand, lower carbon emissions, and more prosperous rural communities,” said Chad Higgins, an associate professor in Oregon State’s College of Agricultural Sciences and the senior author of the paper, which was recently published in Sustainability.
The paper finds that an area about the size of Maryland would be needed if agrivoltaics were to meet 20% of U.S. electricity generation. That’s about 13,000 square miles, or 1% of current U.S. farmland.
The cost of the agrivoltaic arrays would be $1.12 trillion over a 35-year project life. The researchers said they believe that the private sector would cover most of the construction costs, with the federal government contributing rebates and other incentives. Using money generated from the PV arrays, it would take about 17 years to pay back the $1.12 trillion, the researchers estimate. After the projected 35-year project lifespan, the arrays would produce $35.7 billion in annual revenue.
Adoption barriers
The research is not the first in the field. Research led by the University of Arizona’s Greg Barron-Gafford, and published in Nature Sustainability in September 2019, found that shading crops with PV panels can provide multiple benefits, including greater food production, reduced plant drought stress, and a drop in solar panel heat stress.
The Arizona team’s results were based on a dryland farming system and suggested that an agrivoltaic system may be a resilient energy and food system. The researchers warned, however, about “probable barriers to wider adoption,” including challenges associated with mechanized farming and harvesting, along with the additional costs of elevating PV arrays to allow for food production.
SolarPower Europe launched a new working group devoted to agrivoltaics in early 2020. The aim of the group is to boost the deployment of agrivoltaics across Europe by shaping the EU’s agricultural and energy policy agendas.
And in October, German solar developer Next2Sun flipped the switch on an agrivoltaic project in the southern German state of Baden-Württemberg. The 4.1 MW solar project spans around 14 hectares. It was built with roughly 11,000 n-type PERT bifacial solar modules, each with 380 W of power, provided by Chinese manufacturer Jolywood. They were vertically installed on 5,800 racks.
Back in Oregon, Higgins said he plans to install a fully functional solar farm designed to prioritize agricultural activities on five acres of Oregon State’s North Willamette Research and Extension Station near Portland. Ground will be broken in May, with production expected to start in 2022.
Higgins said that the wide-scale installation of agrivoltaic systems opens the door for other technologies. For example, surplus energy generated by the solar arrays could be used to power electric tractors or to generate fertilizer on a farm. And low-cost sensors could be installed on the solar panel platforms to support artificial intelligence-based decisions to improve agricultural productivity.

A division of General Electric, GE Renewable Energy, has signed an agreement with Australia-based consortium BE Power to co-develop the 400 MW Big T pumped-hydro storage project at Cressbrook Dam, near Toowoomba, Queensland.
GE Renewable Energy’s Hydro Solutions CEO, Pascal Radue, said that the company – which has a portfolio of 400 GW of renewable energy installed worldwide – will work with BE Power to optimize and finalize the design of the plant, assist with financing, and start commercial operations.
“We are really excited to join forces with BE Power at the forefront of the next wave of Australian pumped-hydro storage,” Radue said.
Upon completion, the Big T pumped-hydro power plant is expected to produce enough electricity to meet the consumption of about 200,000 local homes. When pumping, it will provide long-duration, high-capacity storage to absorb excess wind and solar output. It is expected that the facility will provide valuable system strength and inertia to the grid, safeguarding security and reliability, as the Queensland government pushes toward its target of 50% renewables by 2030.
In a statement released when the co-development agreement was announced in late December, GE Renewable Energy said that pumped-hydro projects such as Big T represent the most cost-effective and long-lasting solution for the high capacity, long-duration storage that is required. BE Power Managing Director Scott Walkem said the Big T project “will help facilitate new wind and solar projects and provide firming and grid support services at a critical point in the National Electricity Market (NEM).”
The Big T proposal is one of a number of pumped-hydro projects in the pipeline in Australia with the New South Wales and Federal governments backing the technology to support reliability and reduce volatility in the market with the $4.6 billion Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro storage project having received the go-ahead from both bodies.
Snowy 2.0 will provide 2 GW of fast-start, dispatchable energy and provide 350 GWh of large-scale storage, enough to power the equivalent of 500,000 homes for over a week during peak demand.
The Big T project will help build out the Queensland government’s southern Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) which was identified by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) in its final 2020 Integrated System Plan. The southern REZ – one of three REZs unveiled by the state government in 2020 – is proving popular with investors, as it benefits from strong network infrastructure that can accommodate large amounts of renewable capacity.
