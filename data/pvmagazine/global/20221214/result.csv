Chilean energy company Guacolda Energía has finished building a 3 MW solar plant on a tailings dam in Tierra Amarilla, in the sunny Atacama region in northern Chile.
The $3 million project is located on a 4.5-hectare plot of land. The energy it generates will be used for the mining operations of Chilean company Pucobre. René Opazo, operations manager for Guacolda Energía, described the installation as “a milestone for more sustainable mining.”
Tailings dams are earth-fill embankment dams that store the byproducts of mining operations, such as ground rocks, water, and gangue minerals.

The two companies will use the funds to build a 600 MW high-voltage direct current connection between the town of Partanna, Italy, and Cape Bon, a peninsula in Tunisia. The transmission line will extend 200 km and will reach a maximum sea depth of 800 meters.
“It is the first time that CEF funds have been allocated to an infrastructure project developed by a member state and a third country,” the Italian grid operator, Terna, said in a statement. “As a further testament to its strategic importance, the European Commission has allocated over half of the available budget in the 2022 call to the project.”
The €850 million project will increase electricity production from renewable sources in Europe and Africa and promote the diversification of the energy mix.
“Thanks to this project, Italy will be able to firmly establish itself as the Mediterranean energy hub,” said Terna CEO Stefano Donnarumma.
Terna and Société tunisienne de l’électricité et du gaz (STEG), the Tunisian state-owned grid operator, began developing the project in 2003. They started by planning a 1 GW power line and a 1.2 GW power plant in Tunisia to export 800 MW of energy to Italy. In 2011, an economic recession in Europe and falling power demand led to overcapacity in Italy, so the partners agreed to downsize the subsea line to 600 MW, in addition to scrapping plans for the power plant in Tunisia.
In 2016, the project became part of Terna’s National Electricity Transmission Grid Development Plan, as well as part of the Ten-Year Network Development Plan formulated by the European Network of Transmission System Operators.
The two governments signed their first joint declaration for the project in 2007 . They created a 50:50 joint venture company, Elmes Etudes Sarl, to oversee pre-construction activities on the power line.

They claim that a hydrogen-based economy would reduce CO2 emissions and improve air quality, but would also increase hydrogen (H2) emissions due to leaks, venting, purging, and incomplete combustion. The increase in the concentration of tropospheric H2 could reduce the availability of hydroxyl group (OH), which is the dominant sink for methane and hydrogen. “Green H2 can mitigate atmospheric methane if hydrogen losses throughout the value chain are below 9 ± 3%,” the researchers wrote in a new study in Nature Communications. “Blue H2 can reduce methane emissions only if methane losses are below 1%.
The American Bureau of Shipping has reviewed, verified and approved the design of the H2Neo, a 26,000-cubic-meter compressed H2 carrier. It claimed that H2Neo is “the first of its kind to receive this level of approval,” following the completion of the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) by Australia's Provaris Energy. The Perth-based developer will now build and test a prototype hydrogen tank, while preparing for ship construction “with a selected shipyard.” It will take the H2Neo to construction-ready status in 2023, with a bigger green compressed hydrogen carrier to follow in 2026.
Hyundai Motor’s fuel cell unit, HTWO, has signed a partnership with Faun Group’s Enginius subsidiary to supply fuel cell systems for the mass production of hydrogen-powered commercial trucks. “HTWO’s 90 kW fuel cell system will be paired with Enginius chases to provide zero-emission power for waste collection trucks and medium cargo trucks for intra-city goods delivery,” said the two companies. They expect to start field testing in 2024 and series production in 2025.
CWP Global has reached an agreement with the government of Djibouti to develop a 10 GW renewable energy and green hydrogen hub in the Horn of Africa. They said the project will provide secure potable water supplies to local communities and open the door to emerging international markets for green hydrogen and derivatives, including green ammonia. Djibouti wants to promote hydrogen collaboration with regional neighbors, including Ethiopia.
Germany has pledged at least €112 million ($119.4 million) to expand renewable energy, the power grid, and hydrogen production in Kenya. The agreement comes after the two countries signed a climate and development partnership in Sharm El-Sheik, during the COP27. 
The UK government has agreed to provide GBP 25 million ($31 million) to support technologies that could produce hydrogen from sustainable biomass and waste. “Funding will go directly towards progressing BECCS [bioenergy with carbon capture and storage] projects from the design stage to demonstration,” said the government.

Eiffage, a French construction contractor, has revealed that its Eiffage Concessions unit has finalized the acquisition of a 75% stake in French solar developer Sun'R. It did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.
Sun'R founder Antoine Nogier will work with the management team and will maintain a share of the company's capital.
“This merger is a great opportunity for the Sun'R group to change scale while maintaining our agility and the distinctive positioning of our three activities,” said Nogier.
Sun’R, which was established in 2007, generates approximately 80% of its turnover from the production of solar electricity. It has already 100 MW of photovoltaic assets in operation and around 300 MW under development in France and other countries. It also develops agrivoltaic projects in cooperation with its Sun'Agri unit and provides green electricity through its Volterres subsidiary.
“Eiffage Concessions wishes to capitalize on the expertise of the management of the teams of the Sun'R group to accelerate its development in territorial renewable energy and continue to innovate to meet the challenges of territorial transitions,” said Cécile Cambier, the director of Eiffage Concessions.

Kopp has unveiled SmartFlex, a four-panel rooftop PV system based on a fold-out substructure. The new system uses n-type TOPCon solar modules with outputs of 430 W and efficiency ratings of 22.02%.
“The system has a size of approximately 6.8 square meters when unfolded,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
It said the system is easier to install than conventional rooftop systems, as a crane lifts the modules out of their delivery boxes onto rooftops, where they can then be unfolded and connected. The modules can also be connected with just one tool.
The ballast material provides resistance to wind and other extreme weather conditions. A unit with four modules weighs between 150 kg and 300 kg, depending on the number of ballast stones. The substructure is made of Magnelis, a zinc-aluminum-magnesium alloy.
“With the new product, Kopp covers all processes, from technical planning to production and delivery,” said Zouhair Kefi, the head of Kopp's energy and home automation division. “SmartFlex is a revolutionary solution for the growing need for autonomous energy supply using solar power.”

“Our work confirmed that soybean is shade tolerant and can be grown in combination with solar power generation,” researcher Eleonora Potenza told pv magazine.
The 3.2 MW agrivoltaics system, built by Italian specialist Rem Tec, has been operating since August 2021 and features 11,535 polycrystalline panels with capacities of 280 W. The modules were placed at a height of 4.5 meters and are stilt-mounted on a biaxial, full-sun tracking system. The agrivoltaics installation has a total surface of 22,378 square meters and covers an agricultural surface of 171.140 square meters.
The researchers applied four different shade depth (SD) treatments with values of 27%, 16%, 9%, and 18%, respectively, by considering the average value of the SD over the crop-growing cycle. They indicated the treatments with the acronyms AV1, AV2, AV3, and AV4, respectively.
“Each area included four soybean rows, for a total of 16 rows and an area of 144 m2 for a single replicate,” they said.
During several months of testing, the Italian group found that the physiological and morphological traits of soybeans were affected by the shade depth levels. They discovered that the leaf area index (LAI) and the specific leaf area (SLA) of the crop were higher in the most shaded AV areas.
“Regarding yield potential, it is considered that soybean is among the crops that suffer from shading conditions the most,” the scientists said.
The experiment showed, according to the academics, that the average grain yield reduction of soybeans for the whole AV system was 8%. They said that this is largely under the limits of the yield reductions indicated by previous research in agrivoltaics plants in Germany and South Korea.
“In this regard, the regulations in France, Japan, and Germany have set the maximum level of yield reduction that can be achieved under agrivoltaic systems as 10%, 20%, and 34%, respectively,” they said.
“Considering not only soy but more crops and extensive crops in a large scale agrivoltaics is useful for increasing the sustainability of the agrivoltaic system itself,” Potenza concluded. “Differentiating crops and promoting crop rotation also brings benefits to the soil in which they are grown. This may help to diversify the farmer's income not only for energy production but also for agricultural production.”

Meyer Burger, a Switzerland-based heterojunction solar module manufacturer, has signed a multi-year cooperation agreement to develop tandem perovskite solar cell technology with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM) in Switzerland. Its other partners include Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB), the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE), and the University of Stuttgart in Germany.
“With a long tradition of proprietary development, Meyer Burger has an extensive portfolio of processes, technologies, and production techniques at its disposal for the potential mass production of tandem solar cells and modules in-house,” said Marcel König, head of R&D at Meyer Burger. “This includes the essential manufacturing processes and machinery for silicon-based perovskite tandem solar cells, as well as corresponding solar modules with Meyer Burger’s proprietary SmartWire connection technology. In conjunction with the skills of our academic partners, this is a unique recipe for success.”
The partnership is a new attempt to produce tandem perovskite cells, as Oxford PV terminated its cooperation with Meyer Burger in mid-2021, as the photovoltaic manufacturer still wants to use these proprietary technology solutions. The company said that it has already achieved a record efficiency of 29.6% for a 25-square-centimeter perovskite tandem solar cell with CSEM.
“This excellent result shows the potential of silicon perovskite tandem cells to achieve high efficiencies,” said Professor Christophe Ballif, the director of sustainable energy at CSEM. “Even if there is still a lot of work ahead of us, the industrialization of solar cells with an efficiency of over 30% is on the right track.”
The December print edition of pv magazine visits Ukraine to examine the extent of damage caused to the nation’s energy infrastructure, including its solar plants, and includes coverage of how PV has been affected in the newly-liberated region of Kherson.
The HZB has also been researching perovskite technology for a long time and has already achieved efficiencies of more than 31% when combined with heterojunction cells in the laboratory. These results will now be transferred to mass production with Meyer Burger and other partners.
“By manufacturing in Europe, Meyer Burger creates high-quality jobs while making use of technologies developed in Europe,” said Professor Rutger Schlatmann, director of the Competence Center Photovoltaics Berlin PVcomB at HZB.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/14/hydrophobic-nanocoating-to-reduce-soiling-in-solar-panels/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EGYPT",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 14, 2022",Hydrophobic nanocoating to reduce soiling in solar panels,"Scientists at Al-Azhar University in Egypt have developed a hydrophobic nanocoating with  a self-cleaning effect that can reportedly increase the efficiency of solar panels by up to 30.7%.
“The main contribution of this work is to enhance the performance of PV solar panels by reducing the dust accumulation on the panels' surfaces over time, thereby reducing cost, effort, and water consumption while cleaning,” the researchers said “Enhance the performance of photovoltaic solar panels by a self-cleaning and hydrophobic nanocoating,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports.
The researchers used a coating solution based on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanocomposites mixed with ethanol and isopropanol. They dissolved this mixture by using an ultrasonic washer and they then applied it to the solar panels by spray coating. By using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the research group determined that the nanocoating increases the surface roughness at the nano and micro scale, which in turn increases the hydrophobicity and contact angle.
“The metal oxide nanoparticles are well dispersed in the PDMS polymer,” the scientists explained. “Through the hydrophobic chain of PDMS, PDMS-SiO2 nanoparticles cross-link with one another, which further leads to the formation of clusters of different sizes and then the micro-nanostructure.”
By using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV–Vis), the academics also verified that the coating's average transmittance is 91% in the visible light range. They said that it is resistant to ultraviolet radiation. They applied the solution to a 100 W panel and compared its performance to that of a 100 W reference panel without coating and a 100 W panel with a commercial anti-soiling nanocoating. After 40 days of exposure to the environmental conditions in Cairo, the academics found that the hydrophobicity and self-cleaning properties of the PDMS-SiO2 nanocoating made it possible to remove the dust by water droplets by 74%, which compares to just 52% for the reference panel.
They also found that the nanocoated panel's efficiency was up to 30.7% higher than that of the reference panel.
“The nanocoated panel has greater output power, greater efficiency, and the lowest temperature and dust accumulation density,” they concluded. “Because of the hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties of the nanocoated panel, the water droplets rolled off and removed a large amount of dust from the panel surface.
The researchers did not provide details about the costs of the nanocoating, nor did they say whether commercial production is being considered at this stage.

IREC and the International Code Council have published the Energy Storage Systems Guide as part of the Clean Energy Clearinghouse‘s Training for Safety Officials series. The guide is meant to serve as a high-level, non-technical training reference for fire and explosion risks. It provides key standards for equipment and installations (along with applicable hardware codes), and describes inspection techniques for energy storage systems.
One chapter on fire risks in lithium-ion storage systems describes how fire events develop, and includes a breakdown of the 2019 APS battery fire in Arizona. The chapter discusses risk-mitigation techniques that can be integrated at multiple levels of battery construction. It also discusses the tools and safeguards integrated into battery systems, such as smoke, flame, and gas detectors, as well as fire-control panels and fire-suppression systems.
The guide lists 24 unique battery standards. While all of these standards are necessary, five of the standards are described as “most relevant and applicable for the majority of modern ESS applications,” including NFPA 855, UL 9540, UL 9540A, NFPA 68/69, and IEC 62933.
The handbook includes a table of the applicable sections of various installation code books, including the International Fire Code, the International Residential code, the International Building Code, and the National Electrical Code. Of course, not all codes are applicable to all projects. It ends with a series of checklists, and the “Basis of Requirement” that drives the actions in the checklists. For instance, the first item in the “Document Submittal Checklist” is the Commissioning Plan – whose Basis of Requirements is the IFC 1207.1.3. The other checklists are the “Utility-Scale BESS Enclosure Inspection Checklist”, the “UL 9540A 4th Edition Unit Level Report Checklist”, and the “Residential or Small Commercial Packaged BESS Inspection Checklist.”

The United States added 4.6 GW of new solar capacity in the third quarter, down 17% year on year. According to the US Solar Market Insight Q4 2022 report, published by SEIA and Wood Mackenzie, trade barriers and ongoing supply chain constraints are to blame for the decrease, despite the introduction of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The total decline for the year will be 23%, according to the report.
Detainments under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) are depressing near-term solar installation forecasts and delaying the impact of the IRA, the report contends. The UFLPA presumes that goods manufactured in the Xinjiang region of China are made with forced labor, and the onus is on manufacturers to prove otherwise.
The act went into effect in June, and resulted in US Customs and Border Protection seizing and retaining more than 1,000 shipments of solar equipment. In August, ROTH Capital Partners said that more than 3 GW of components had been held up at customs. It estimated that much as 8 GW to 12 GW of solar modules could be prevented from entering the US market by the end of the year.
The US Department of Commerce’s decision earlier this month to apply anti-circumvention tariffs on solar products from Southeast Asia risks future solar deployment, but the ruling was not taken into account in the SEIA outlook. The department had thrown out an earlier request in 2021 by an anonymous group of solar companies seeking tariffs on a handful of companies that import modules. But Auxin Solar, a small US panel assembler, then filed a new round of antidumping/anti-circumvention (AD/CVD) cases against Malaysia, Thailand, and now Cambodia.
In June 2022, the the US government paused the issue with a two-year tariff exemption. Now the threat is that after the two-year pause, the tariffs will be back in play. The SEIA report notes that while the AD/CVD ruling was not issued in time to be incorporated into the forecasts, they see new tariffs as a downside risk to the outlook.
“America’s clean energy economy hindered by its own trade actions,” said SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “The solar and storage industry is acting decisively to build an ethical supply chain, but unnecessary supply bottlenecks and trade restrictions are preventing manufacturers from getting the equipment they need to invest in US facilities. In the aftermath of the [IRA], we cannot afford to waste time tinkering with trade laws as the climate threat looms.”
In addition to hampering the flow of goods to the United States, the supply chain challenges have caused prices to escalate across the solar industry. For the fifth consecutive quarter, year-over-year prices have increased across all market segments. Utility-scale prices, for example, are 12.7% higher than they were a year ago. As a result, 2022 installation forecasts show deployment dropping from 30 GW to 15 GW over the last year.
“Installations this year were significantly depressed due to supply chain constraints” said Michelle Davis, principal analyst and lead author of the report. “It has proven more difficult and time-consuming to provide the proper evidence to comply with the UFLPA, further delaying equipment delivery to the US.”
There is good news, however. Solar accounted for 45% of all new electricity-generating capacity added to the US grid through the third quarter. The residential sector has not experienced a drop – in fact it saw a 43% increase over the third quarter of 2021, with 1.57 GW installed. Some of this came from California, where residents scramble to get solar installed before net metering changes kick in. And overall, the report forecasts that growth, resulting from the IRA, will begin in 2024, with annual solar growth averaging 21% between 2023-27.
Further good news is that the solar industry is expected to return to growth after 2022. Supply chain relief should arrive after the second quarter of 2023, and at that point “the true impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act will manifest in our outlooks,” according to the report. Annual installations of solar will consistently reach 30 to 40 GW (DC) by 2024. From 2023-27, the report forecasts 21% average annual growth across all solar segments, although report authors note that AD/CVD tariffs present a downside risk that will be included in future outlooks.

US-based Solar Inventions has revealed that it has secured patents in the United States, China and Israel for its novel architecture for PV cells and modules.
Ben Damiani, chief technology officer of Atlanta-based Solar Inventions, said that a manufacturer could create multiple “lanes” or subcells on a single wafer by electrically dividing each cell during the metalization process. The Configurable Current Cells (C3) process does not require any capital expenditure or process changes for solar cell manufacturers to implement. For cell manufacturers, C3 only requires small changes in metalization print patterns and selective doping.
The process creates a new architecture that makes improvements on cell, module, and system performance while saving up to 18% of the silver required. This equates to $2 million to $5 million in savings per gigawatt under current silver prices, as silver typically represents about 10% of a solar module's cost structure. Select pilot tests and modeling have also shown up to 3 W per panel in additional power.
The US authorities recently issued a continuation patent that broadens claims from Solar Inventions’ first patent and includes configurations for most modern cell structures.
“As the solar industry shifts to new cell structures such as Topcon and HJT and production continues to accelerate around the globe, the economic benefits of our Configurable Current Cell (C3) technology gain importance,” said Damiani. “C3 dramatically increases silver cost savings for solar cell manufacturers, while adding power and resiliency.”
In September 2019, the technology won first place in the US Department of Energy’s American-Made Solar Prize contest for innovative technologies.
C3 cells are based on Damiani’s Resistively Bound Subcells (RBS). C3 creates isolated changes in cell resistance through a combination of metalization laydown changes. The patent identified specific metalization patterns, both on the top and bottom of cells, that together create precise areas of higher cell resistance. These are used as electrical boundaries around the hybrid subcells. These subcells exhibit characteristics that have previously only been possible with exotic wafer processing techniques or physical cleaving such as half-cells, said Solar Inventions.
