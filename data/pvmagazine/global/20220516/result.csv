Portuguese utility EDP has finished building a 5 MW floating PV plant at the Alqueva hydropower dam, at the largest reservoir in Portugal.
The facility features 26,600 floating structures provided by Spain's Isigenere and 12,000 solar modules supplied by an unnamed manufacturer. It is also linked to 2 MWh of lithium-ion batteries.
The floats are made of corkscrew composite – a 100% natural, recyclable and biocompatible raw material – with recycled polymers. A specific anchoring and mooring system for complex environments has been implemented under the “FRESHER” European Innovation project. Isigenere has participated in the project for the last two years.
Miguel Patena, director of the EDP group in charge of the solar project, said that the electricity produced by the floating park would cost about one-third of that produced by a gas plant.
Maetel installed the floating solar platform and the electrical components, while the FRESHER consortium designed and installed the anchoring and mooring systems. Seaflex supplied the flexible moorings and Top Marinas installed the  anchors and moorings.  Preffor provided the ultra-high-resistance concrete elements that support the 22,000 kg floating platform and the perimeter protective pontoons, while Amorim Cork Composites supplied the natural cork polymer.

“Our system configuration has been initially applied to the subsidized Indian market, but it can also be utilized and operated more profitably without subsidies,” researcher B. Shyam told pv magazine.
The scientists simulated a system based a water reservoir at the Meenar-I dam in the Indian state of Kerala. They considered a subsidized time-of-day (ToD) tariff for renewable energy projects in the region. The facility was modeled using MATLAB 2021b and two different algorithms were used for optimal scheduling and design.
“The upper and lower reservoirs are 800 meters apart, and the available head is about 90 meters,” the scientists said.
In the proposed system configuration, the pumped-hydro facility stores grid electricity during off-peak hours by pumping water to the upper reservoir. During peak hours, the system feeds the load and doesn't get power from the grid.
Its mode of operation is determined by electricity prices, load demand, solar PV availability, and reservoir status. The PV system is located in the upper reservoir and has a capacity of 250 kW. The 850 solar modules have a power conversion efficiency of 16% and a temperature coefficient of 0.47% per degree Celsius. Water evaporation loss is assumed to be minimum due to the presence of a floating cover.
For daily scheduling, the scientists considered six operating modes:
The last configuration had the lowest daily operational cost and was chosen as the base case for further investigation.
“For Case-VI, the round-trip efficiency of the system is about 57.13%,” the scientists said. “When the model is simulated with Case-VI conditions for a typical day, daily operating cost is reduced by about 40% … Once the storage is saturated, the excess energy from PV modules cannot be stored.”
Through their analysis, the academics found that the PV system can achieve savings at a levelized cost of INR 0.8518 ($0.011)/kWh and a levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of INR 4.2713/kWh.
“The size of the PV system is critical to the system configuration. Utilizing the given reservoir area to its maximum capacity will result in the lowest unit and operational costs. However, only a portion of the reservoir may be utilized for PV module installation due to practical constraints. Existing large-scale cascaded power plants integrated with a floating PV system can produce better LCOS,” said Shyam.
The researchers described the proposed approach in “Feasibility of floating solar PV integrated pumped storage system for a grid-connected microgrid under static time of day tariff environment: A case study from India,” published in Renewable Energy.

They claim it improves the energy efficiency of buildings, with potential use in passive cooling for PV modules and residential batteries. The new material is a shape-stabilized phase change material (ss-PCM) that can store up to five times more thermal energy than commercially available PCMs.
The ss-PCM is said to absorb large amounts of heat by changing its physical state from solid to liquid, and then releasing it when the material hardens.
“It could be used by the construction industry as large panels that could be integrated into walls,” said MLU scientist Thomas Hahn. “These would then absorb heat during the sunny hours of the day and release it again later when the temperature goes down.”
The ss-PCM was synthesized via a novel porogen-assisted sol-gel process, which resulted in high mechanical stability, according to the academics.
“In our invention, the heat storage material is enclosed in a framework of solid silicate and cannot escape due to high capillary forces,” said Hahn.
All the material configurations that were tested displayed a shape-stability of around 100%, a long-term performance of approximately 2,000 thermal cycles, and high chemical stability. The scientists said they achieved results regardless of the amount of porogen used in the synthesis.
“Until now the material is still only being produced in small quantities in the laboratory,” they said. “In the future, it can be combined with other steps to help to make buildings significantly more energy efficient or to passively cool photovoltaic systems and batteries, thereby increasing their efficiency.”
They introduced the material in “Influence of surfactants and organic polymers on monolithic shape-stabilized phase change materials synthesized via sol-gel route,” which was recently published in the Journal of Energy Storage. They also analyzed the influence of the porogens sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) on ss-PCM properties.

The PV installation has a capacity of 36 kW and features 10,680 diamond-shaped solar modules provided by France-based organic PV module maker Asca, a unit of Armor solar power films. The system covers a surface of 1,333 square meters.

The facade was designed and engineered by iart, a Swiss studio for media architectures, in collaboration with architects AMDL Circla and Michele De Lucchi. “The arrangement of the solar modules on the dome-shaped Novartis Pavillon enables the measurement of the electricity produced in all directions,” iart said. “Data collected during the first few months of operation shows that the façade produces enough power to display text in the daytime – when the exhibition is open – and digital art animations for up to two hours after sunset.”
Armor said its solar modules can achieve a 26% efficiency in low light environments. Currently, its solar technology is mainly used to supply electricity to small connected objects indoors, in environments where the light is low (from 200 lux), such as temperature sensors and geolocation trackers.
“Their design and physical properties make these organic solar modules ideal for use on the dome-shaped Novartis Pavillon, as they can be produced in various shapes, are bendable, translucent, and extremely light-sensitive,” iart said. “Which means they can also be installed in spots not ideally oriented towards the sun.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/16/global-solar-demand-to-reach-190-gw-this-year-says-iea/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 16, 2022","Global solar demand to reach 190 GW this year, says IEA","From pv magazine Australia
A new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggests that new renewable energy capacity additions will exceed 300 GW globally this year for the first time, with mounting concerns about climate change and energy security driving an 8% increase, after new installations reached almost 295 GW in 2021.
The IEA said that despite persistent pandemic-induced supply chain challenges, construction delays, and record-level raw material and commodity prices, renewable capacity additions increased by a record 6% globally in 2021.
In its latest Renewable Energy Market report, the IEA suggests new capacity for generating electricity from solar, wind and other renewables will grow to a record high in 2022, rising by more than 8% compared with last year, up by nearly 320 GW with China, Latin America and the European Union leading the way.
IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said the Russian invasion of Ukraine has added new urgency to accelerate clean energy transitions with governments increasingly looking to take advantage of renewables’ energy security and climate benefits.
“Energy market developments in recent months, especially in Europe, have proven once again the essential role of renewables in improving energy security, in addition to their well-established effectiveness at reducing emissions,” he said. “Cutting red tape, accelerating permitting and providing the right incentives for faster deployment of renewables are some of the most important actions governments can take to address today’s energy security and market challenges, while keeping alive the possibility of reaching our international climate goals.”
Solar is forecast to account for 60% of the increase in global renewable capacity this year with the IEA predicting the commissioning of 190GW, a 25% gain from last year. The Paris-based body said utility-scale projects account for almost two-thirds of overall PV expansion in 2022, mostly driven by a strong policy environment in China and the EU driving faster deployment.
China accounted for 46% of worldwide renewable capacity additions in 2021 and is expected to largely maintain its market share of deployment in 2022-2023, with the commissioning of more than 140 GW on average per year, driven mostly by large-scale solar PV deployment.
The growth in renewables comes despite elevated commodity and freight prices. The IEA said prices for many raw materials and freight costs have been on an increasing trend since the beginning of 2021. By March 2022, the price of PV-grade polysilicon more than quadrupled, steel increased by 50%, copper rose by 70%, aluminium doubled and freight costs rose almost five-fold.
“Compared with 2020, we estimate that the overall investment costs of new utility-scale PV and onshore wind plants are from 15% to 25% higher in 2022,” the IEA said. “Surging freight costs are the biggest contributor to overall price increases for onshore wind. For solar PV, the impact is more evenly divided among elevated prices for freight, polysilicon and metals.”
While predicting solar PV costs will remain higher in 2022 and 2023 than pre-pandemic levels, the IEA said the technology’s price competitiveness had actually improved due to much sharper increases in natural gas and coal prices.
“Although costs for new solar PV and wind installations have increased, reversing a decade-long cost reduction trend, natural gas, oil, and coal prices have risen much faster, therefore actually further improving the competitiveness of renewable electricity,” it said.
While the outlook for new renewable energy capacity additions looks strong for 2022, the IEA cautioned that based on current policies “renewable power’s global growth is set to lose momentum next year.”
While solar PV is forecast to break another record in 2023, reaching almost 200GW, this is offset by an expected 40% decline in hydropower expansion and “little change” in wind additions.
“In the absence of stronger policies, the amount of renewable power capacity added worldwide is expected to plateau in 2023,” it said. “Ultimately, the forecast of renewable markets for 2023 and beyond will depend on whether new and stronger policies will be introduced and implemented in the next six months.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/16/emissions-free-battery-recycling-facility-will-use-electricity-rather-than-smelting/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 16, 2022",Emissions-free battery recycling facility will use electricity rather than smelting,"From pv magazine USA
ACE Green Recycling haws said that it will construct a battery recycling facility in Texas that operates on a proprietary emissions-free system. 
The plant is expected to recycle both lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries – the key elements of both electric vehicles and conventional vehicles, energy storage, and mobile devices. Phase one of operations is scheduled for the third quarter, starting with the recycling of lead-acid batteries, followed by the lithium-ion operation, said ACE Green Recycling. By 2025, at full capacity, the facility is expected to process up to 100,000 metric tons of lead-acid batteries and 20,000 metric tons of lithium-ion batteries. 
Battery recycling is typically done by a smelting process that involves extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 1,000 C, while burning expensive and pollutive fossil fuels, and exposing workers to hazardous working conditions.  
Rather than smelting, ACE’s process is fully electrified. The company said this leads to an emissions-free higher battery material yield and a safer workplace environment.
At full operation, the project is expected to recycle more than 5 million lead-acid batteries, abate more than 50,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, reduce landfill dumping of more than 10 million pounds of hazardous solid waste, and recycle more than 15 million pounds of plastics annually. The facility is expected to create 100 Texas-based jobs.
ACE said it is also exploring opportunities to power most of its key plant activities with solar energy to address its Scope 2 emissions. The plant would be truly “emissions-free” if solar PV or other emissions-free generators are used as the sole source of power. 
Due to a lack of sufficient recycling capacity, the US currently exports a large amount of its scrap batteries to Mexico and Asia while importing new materials back, leading to major value losses and an inefficient use of energy to ship these materials around the world. By establishing a large recycling center in Texas, ACE said it intends to alleviate US dependence on imports. 
“Texas sits at the heart of the world’s global energy revolution with key access to an abundant pool of top engineering and technical talent. ACE’s new facility aims to be part of that revolution and build a greener, more sustainable future for America,” said Nishchay Chadha, ACE’s co-founder and chief executive. 
“We are excited to establish our first North American facility in the state of Texas that will not only generate significant local economic activity but also contribute to a greener environmental footprint,” said Dr Vipin Tyagi, co-founder and chief technology officer. “By contributing to America’s battery recycling capabilities, we also aim to strengthen the country’s energy independence and build a more resilient future for the nation.”
ACE Green Recycling is an American technology company with global operations across Southeast Asia and India. It is set to announce new facilities in Asia, Europe and the Middle East by early 2023.
The announcement follows a US Department of Energy unveiled plan to inject $60 million into second-life opportunities for batteries once used for EVs. The $60 million comes in addition to the $3.1 billion funding for battery manufacturing, processing, and recycling nationwide.
“Positioning the United States front and center in meeting the growing demand for advanced batteries is how we boost our competitiveness and electrify our transportation system,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “President Biden’s historic investment in battery production and recycling will give our domestic supply chain the jolt it needs to become more secure and less reliant on other nations—strengthening our clean energy economy, creating good paying jobs, and decarbonizing the transportation sector.”
