Brazil deployed 4.2 GW of new distributed-generation solar in the first six months of 2023, according to Aneel, the country's regulator. This included the connection of 365,000 new systems to the grid under the net-metering regime.
By the end of June, the cumulative capacity of distributed PV systems in Brazil, including installations up to 5 MW in size, reached 22 GW. These installations were distributed across more than 2 million arrays.
In the first half of the year, the residential segment accounted for approximately 2.12 GW of the newly installed capacity, while the commercial segment contributed around 1 GW. The remaining capacity was represented by small-scale solar parks.
Among the states, São Paulo demonstrated the highest growth, adding 656 MW in the first six months, followed by Minas Gerais with an additional 460 MW. Minas Gerais currently leads in cumulative capacity with 3,002 MW, slightly ahead of São Paulo's 3,000 MW.
Eight states in Brazil have surpassed the milestone of 1 GW of installed capacity each by the end of June. Apart from Minas Gerais and São Paulo, these states include Rio Grande do Sul with 2,272 MW, Paraná with 2,140 MW, Santa Catarina with 1,365 MW, Mato Grosso with 1,286 MW, Goiás with 1,023 MW, and Bahia as the sole Northeastern state with over 1 GW, specifically 1,000.235 MW.
Most of the capacity added in the first half of the year came from on-site installations, accounting for 77% of the observed expansion in 2023, totaling 3,264 MW. In cumulative terms, on-site distributed generation represents 77% of the total with 17,229 MW.

Under the scheme, individuals and homeowners are able to claim rebates equal to 25% of the cost of the solar panels, up to a maximum of ZAR 15,000.
“Pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) taxpayers will be able to claim the rebate on assessment during the 2023/24 filing season while provisional taxpayers will be able to claim the rebate against provisional and final payments,” the government said referring to the new requirements. “Individuals will be able to claim the rebate if they have a VAT invoice that indicates the cost of the solar PV panels separately from other items, along with proof of payment.”
In addition, the government now mandates a certificate of compliance for PV systems purchased between March 1, 2023, and Feb. 29, 2024, along with a certificate of compliance with the Electrical Installation Regulations, 2009.
The provisions specify that the solar panels eligible for the rebate can be installed as part of a new or existing system, with a minimum output of 275 W. Portable panels may not qualify for the program.
“There is no ownership limitation for the incentive, so installations by landlords or renters would be eligible, but only the party that pays for the solar panels can claim the rebate,” the government said. “If occupants of a sectional title are enabled to install their own panels, then the tax incentive applies as for all other individuals. However, a body corporate will not be able to claim this incentive.”
Storage systems, inverters, diesel generators, and installation costs will not be covered by the program. The South African Photovoltaic Industry Association (SAPVIA) has already criticized the changes to the scheme.´

First Solar has revealed that Canadian power producer Capital Power has ordered 1 GW of its Series 6 Plus solar modules. The modules are expected to be delivered between 2026 and 2028, as demand for First Solar’s technology pushes its orders further into the future.
“Capital Power joins a growing group of project developers that partner with First Solar as a reliable module technology provider that can help de-risk their project pipelines by delivering long-term pricing and supply certainty,” said Georges Antoun, chief commercial officer of First Solar. “We are pleased that Capital Power selected Responsible Solar technology to power its assets reliably, affordably and sustainably.”
Capital Power operates 7.5 GW of capacity across 29 facilities in North America. The company has a mixed asset base of solar, wind, gas, energy storage, and waste heat facilities. It has a US solar pipeline of about 2.4 GW (DC).
In the first quarter, First Solar executed 9.9 GW of contracts and recognized 1.9 GW of volume sold, resulting in a total backlog of 69.4 GW, with an aggregate value sold of $20.4 billion. During the quarter, First Solar produced 2.36 GW of Series 6 panels.
First Solar’s cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film modules have among the lowest carbon and water footprint of any commercially available PV module today. The company’s CdTe technology certified a new record in Q1 2023 with a conversion efficiency of 22.3%.
The modules are included in the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) registry for sustainable electronics, signifying strong performance on metrics evaluating the management of substances in the product, manufacturing energy and water use, product packaging, end-of-life recycling and corporate responsibility.
“Credible life cycle-based ecolabels like EPEAT make it easier for solar developers, investors, and end-users to identify environmentally leading products from socially responsible companies,” said Samantha Sloan, vice president of policy, sustainability and marketing at First Solar.
The module provider is investing $1.3 billion in expanding its US manufacturing footprint from over 6.5 GW of annual nameplate capacity today, to approximately 10.9 GW by 2026. About $1.1 billion was invested in the company’s new 3.5 GW facility in Alabama, and $185 million was directed to improve and expand its original facility in Ohio.
The company also announced an investment of up to $370 million in a research and development innovation center that is set to begin operating in 2024.
First Solar also recently showcased fully functional, pre-commercial, bifacial thin-film PV modules at Intersolar Europe in Munich, Germany. First Solar’s research and development teams have reportedly developed a transparent back contact for the module. This innovative feature allows infrared wavelengths of light to pass through the back of the module instead of being absorbed as heat. It also enables bifacial energy generation. The manufacturer said that this technology will reduce the operational temperature of the module and increase its specific energy yield.

Germany's second-largest energy supplier, LEAG, plans to produce hydrogen through a power-to-gas plant at its lignite open-cast mine in Upper Lusatia, Germany.
The company has filed an approval request with the Brandenburg State Office for the Environment, and the project, called the Innovative Storage Power Plant, is currently undergoing a public consultation process. Immission control is a major concern for the companies involved.
LEAG's power-to-X facility will store electricity from wind and solar power in two parallel systems. It will utilize a 40 MW electrolyzer to produce 700 kg of hydrogen per hour. The company aims to convert the hydrogen back into electricity through a gas and steam turbine combined cycle power plant with a capacity of 945 MW.
The storage power plant will also include a thermal solid-state storage facility with a capacity of 1,000 MWh, integrated into the gas turbine system to optimize energy yield. Afry, a German engineering company, is responsible for the project design. In the initial expansion stage, the H2-ready turbine will convert 53% hydrogen into electricity in a natural gas mixture. LEAG plans to transition the turbine to operate with pure hydrogen at a later stage.
According to Afry engineers, the system is designed to rely solely on thermal storage from day one, enabling a completely CO₂-free power supply. Besides generating electricity through burning in a gas turbine, the hydrogen can also be converted into electricity in fuel cells. The system stores the hydrogen at 400 bar, and local public transport buses can directly refuel at the facility.
The Lusatia lignite opencast mine is being transformed into an extensive energy park for wind power, photovoltaics, battery storage, and power-to-X. The goal is to have 7 GW of generating capacity by 2030, with photovoltaic output alone reaching 7 GW by 2040.
LEAG also plans to commission a 500 MWh storage facility using iron redox flux storage technology from US manufacturer ESS at the Boxberg power plant in Lusatia.

India's WindStream Energy Technologies has developed a hybrid wind-solar-powered LED street light system that generates more energy per square foot than a solar street light.
It recently launched the off-grid lighting system by installing it at the Hyderabad campus of the National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj. The off-grid LED street light system includes solar modules, a wind turbine, backup batteries, a controller, and an LED.
The battery ensures continuous power supplies and covers deficiencies in power generation from renewable energy sources. The hybrid street light is available in 20 W, 40 W, and 60 W versions.
“The light-dependent resistor (LDR) in the street light enables an automatic switch on/off. Passive infra-red (PIR) sensor helps to reduce power consumption and increase the autonomy of the light,” Venkat Kumar Tangirala, managing director at Windstream Energy Technologies, told pv magazine. “The winched setup enables the panel to be brought down, cleaned, and rolled up to its position.”

Zhang said that the new factory will supply solar cells to the company's two module plants, with plans to achieve a combined capacity of 30 GW module production by the end of this year. He noted that GCL is a comprehensive PV manufacturer with a complete industrial chain.
“With our Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR) technology, we have a cost advantage from the materials, and also reduced carbon footprint manufacturing throughout all segments in the making of modules,” said Zhang, noting that GCL-Si has invested CNY 8 billion in the new cell factory in Wuhu.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/05/new-study-finds-growing-inequality-in-metal-footprints-of-renewable-power-value-chains/,"INVERTERS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",VALERIE THOMPSON,"JULY 5, 2023",New study finds growing inequality in metal footprints of renewable power value chains,"An international research group has used quantitative models to analyze data about the flow of iron, copper, aluminum, and other precious metals from source to end-use destination in the renewable energy infrastructure value chain to reveal trends and potential risks.
The study found a growing inequality in metal footprints, which are defined in the paper as the total metal ores embodied in the renewable power value chains. The authors said this kind of uneven activity may “hinder the just net-zero transition and climate change mitigation actions” and that there is an urgency “to establish a metal-efficient and green supply chain for upstream suppliers [source countries of metals] as well as downstream renewable power installers for just transition in the power sector across the globe.”
Noting that the amount of metal used in renewable energy infrastructure has increased by 97% in the ten-year period from 2005 to 2015, the paper’s authors examined the flow of metals in seven value chains, including solar, solar thermal, ocean, wind, hydro, bioenergy, and geothermal.
They developed a multi-regional input-output model and a value chain decomposition model that are said to enable the analysis of the activity for worldwide regions and individual countries. They sourced data from Exiobase, a dataset used that estimates emissions and resource extractions by industry, developed by a consortium of research institutes in projects financed by the European research framework programs.
The scientists found imbalances within the global value chains studied and attributed them to the continuous outsourcing of metal demand for the renewable power sector to developing economies. “Developed economies occupy the high-end segments of the renewable power value chain, while allocating metal-intensive (but low value-added) production activities to developing economies,” they also stated, noting that some economies are contributing a considerable amount of metal from their reserves to fulfill foreign demand but have only minimal economic benefit.
The academics presented their findings in the paper “Tracing metal footprints via global renewable power value chains,” published in nature communications. The research group comprises scientists from China's Shandong University, Fudan University, Guangxi University, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), as well as from the University of Maryland in the United States.
“Our results indicate that the trade structure can be modified to mitigate metal supply risk and consumption inequality along global renewable power value chains (RPVCs) among economies,” they concluded. “Import-dependent developed economies can adjust the distribution of traded goods towards metal-efficient sources.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/05/conquering-change-artificial-intelligence-and-how-to-be-future-ready/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"JULY 5, 2023",Conquering change: Artificial Intelligence and how to be future ready,"Tomorrow will differ from yesterday; as the Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, “Change is the only constant.” The ability to handle change between yesterday and tomorrow, but more importantly between tomorrows-to-come to the days after-tomorrows-to-come, would differentiate between the good and the best.
For years, and at the time when I first started working in the energy sector in India, the emphasis was on accelerating coal and oil & gas use, and cleaning it up. For example, some 35 years ago, I worked on developing fuel cell technology, but the goal was more efficient and cleaner coal utilization through coal gas. Hydrogen as a directly available fuel was unheard of in those days. We spoke of converting coal gas to hydrogen, natural gas to hydrogen, and so on.
Just 35 years later, the preoccupations in the energy sector have entirely changed. Now renewables are the prime source of energy. More than $400 billion was invested globally in renewable electricity generating capacity in 2021, compared to less than $140 billion in fossil fuel generating capacity in the same year. This implies that many of us trained in coal utilization — my Ph.D., for example, was in coal-burning fluidized bed boilers — have had to restructure our mental frameworks to remain relevant in these changed times.
Now, imagine the implications of this shift for an organization over an individual. Let’s take Indian utility NTPC, for example, which has about 58,000 MW of coal-based power generation capacity and about 18,000 people — of which approximately 10,000 are engineers who design, install, and maintain power stations. NTPC has now pivoted from coal-based power generation to renewable electricity generation. They have installed over 3,000 MW of renewable electricity and are looking to install 60,000 MW of renewable capacity by 2032. On the other hand, they look to expand to about 3,000 MW of coal-based capacity, which has led to NTPC creating new companies to attract capital, manage RE assets and so on. But their most important undertaking to manage their transition is a major reskilling initiative within the organization to steer this change. And this need for reskilling is an aspect that most people, both in the workplace and management, have not even considered.
What are then the fundamentals behind managing technological change? Human resource reskilling is a critical issue, but even more important than the corporate context is the personal context: how do we change to fit into a changing world? The world 20 years from now will be a very different place, just as the world of today is so different from the world of the 1990s. Just imagine the changes that will occur across sectors and not just in the realm of energy.
We must consider what it will take to be “future fit.” The essential pillar, in my opinion, will remain a good education, with clear fundamentals and an educational experience that stresses developing life skills and understanding the curricula. Additionally, the ability to learn on the go and master new trends continually will help in becoming future influencers, rather than being followers.
In the solar sector, where I currently work, we have seen examples of such influencers of change in the development of new and innovative designs and of standard operating procedures. For example, an Indian company with a rather non-Indian name, Sterling and Wilson, is today one of the world leaders in installing and maintaining solar systems. The installation, and the supply chain required for the installation, are based on a set of standard operating procedures, which are periodically reviewed considering the recent experience and have helped in both standardizing and accelerating the process. A visit to their website is an education: their learnings in various issues are captured and presented there.
Similarly, companies that have focused on creating the decision-making structures that enable the adoption of solar energy, despite its higher first cost, have become market leaders in their segments. For example, the Mahindra group of companies has established an internal carbon price that enables investment in solar projects over those based on fossil fuels. This enabled it to “see” electric vehicles as the future.
Similarly, in the Tata group of companies, an institutional architecture has been created, which enables investment decisions that favor sustainability, with the investment decisions being made at the senior management level, and then institutionalized processes decide on procurement, implementation, operation, marketing, etc. They are the other big electric vehicle player in the Indian market. They are also investing in manufacturing and installing solar cells, looking at making steel low and zero carbon.
We are seeing knowledge, technological, and managerial changes speed up around us. The status quo is changing and will continue to change. Managing change is a key ability that separates and will continue to separate the wheat from the chaff.
So, how do we make ourselves change-ready? There are two important qualities in the people who have successfully managed the change of tomorrow.
The first is the ability to read and read broadly: literature, popular fiction, technology, as well as management and finance. We need to find the time to do so. My window is early mornings, much to the dislike of my dog, who passed away in 2021 after being with us for about fifteen and a half years. He used to get very upset when I woke up early in the morning to catch up on my reading, which disturbed his sleep. It was a daily tussle explaining to him that he had to find a different corner so that I could read, and he could carry on sleeping. The second quality, dependent on the first but not a necessary follow-on, is introducing and integrating the ideas we have discovered through our readings into methodologies and practices in our fields and persevering with changes if they don’t work the first time.
For example, in the energy sector, we started reading about the revolutionary LED lamps in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, we established many demonstration projects to show and popularize them, which could have yielded better results. However, by 2012, the price of LED lamps had come down to a level where they were cheaper than conventional incandescent lamps and even CFLs, but on a lifetime basis, not a first-cost basis. This led, on the one hand – through a specially created company, Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) – to an extensive procurement program to bring the prices down, and on the other hand, to making the LED bulbs available to consumers in installments. The monthly installments were less than the monthly savings due to replacing CFLs with LED lamps. And what a revolutionary change it has been. Today, it isn’t easy to find a CFL bulb anywhere; almost all lighting sources are now LED and have been for over five years.
So how do we read widely, and how do we integrate new ideas into the work processes of our areas?
Books and magazines are good choices. Still, for most of us, the first thing that comes to mind, and something that we have all used today, is the internet for educating ourselves on new technologies, ideas, and trends, primarily through search engines. We have often “copied and pasted” from websites identified by Google, especially when entering new study areas. However, cutting and pasting is unethical, and there are programs such as “Turnitin” to ensure the originality of the work. We have also seen that among the wheat, as opposed to the chaff, cutting and pasting decreases as one grows more proficient in a subject. Their writing reflects their own experiences rather than those of websites from which they had cut and pasted earlier. But, good or bad, Google and other search engines have helped us learn and manage change.
We are now seeing the development of artificial intelligence – especially of programs such as ChatGPT and Google Bard, which are based on natural language processing. The experience these tools lend is both experiential and exceptional. For example, when I typed into ChatGPT: “The future is about change. Solar energy is a change agent, and so is ChatGPT. The future will be about the ability to talk to ChatGPT about solar energy.”
And lo and behold, within seconds, ChatGPT responded, and it is instructive to read the complete response, which I note here:
“The development of AI technology and large language models, like ChatGPT, are also change agents in their own right and have the potential to impact the future in many ways. The ability to converse with AI models like ChatGPT is convenient and opens up new opportunities for education, research, and innovation. For example, ChatGPT can provide quick and accurate answers to questions about solar energy, making it easier for people to learn about and understand this important technology. It can also be used to analyze data and make predictions about solar energy and the energy sector more broadly. Moreover, the use of AI in the energy sector is already leading to innovations and improvements, such as optimizing solar panel placement and developing innovative grid systems that can better manage energy distribution.
In short, the future of solar energy and AI technology is intertwined, and both have the potential to drive positive change and shape the world in exciting and meaningful ways.”
This response is pretty good! It is the high-quality output that is “thoughtful”, relevant, and specific. It is well-written, and is also correct.
I found that increasing or decreasing the length and detail of the input query to ChatGPT and even repeating the same question can change the response. This suggests that all ChatGPT answers are original, and the response depends on the input query. This suggests that ChatGPT and other natural language processors have the potential to reshape our lives and our experiences completely. These responses are a much faster way of learning and sharing our learning.
In a sense, this is like many search engines. In Google, for example, the input quality determines which websites are identified because of that query. Consequently, our future is about how we interact with the ChatGPTs (i.e., AI tools) of the future: how we phrase our input queries and fact-check the responses.
There is no doubt that a well-phrased input query enhances our productivity many times. It remains to be seen whether the AI algorithms that power ChatGPT and its brothers can sift between knowledge on the one hand and false news on the other. Still, AI and the language of the input query provide us with a powerful tool against incorrect information. There is also the fear that using these tools would enhance electronic intrusiveness in our lives, consequently increasing the chances of remote data capture due to this improved intrusiveness.
There will be questions on how we use the ChatGPTs and Google Bards of the future. For example, here are four questions:
These programs foretell that disruptive change could occur in our homes, classrooms, and offices. We must be ready for this change, regardless of whether offices and schools formally incorporate it.
We must ensure that we are prepared to manage change: the change has been happening and will continue to occur worldwide. This is obviously a challenge for us, but it is also a great opportunity. Our ability to integrate new knowledge into our skills and worldview will determine how we move with time. Learning new knowledge is essential, and new skills could help us become more change ready.

It said the Ministry of Energy has already examined and approved the transmission line, which will span 150 km from Ashkelon in the south to Haifa in the north.
The Israeli government said that the maritime strip for the project will align with the area designated for natural gas activities. It noted the need to evaluate electric cables, natural gas pipelines, and other infrastructure to mitigate environmental impacts.
The government also noted the possibility of connecting the new cable to a submarine transmission line planned by Israel, Greece, and Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea. This interconnector, projected to be completed by 2024 and operational by 2025, would have a power capacity of 1,000 MW to 2,000 MW.
The new cable is also designed to link with existing transmission lines that presently distribute electricity to Jordan, Egypt, and the Gulf states. Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz noted the project's significance in advancing the Israeli electricity grid and establishing the country as an energy powerhouse.
“We want to become an energy bridge connecting east and west,” said Katz. 
Israel recently introduced several measures to support solar energy development. In late May, the Israel Land Authority issued a tender to lease 28,000 acres (11,331 hectares) in the Negev desert for the deployment of large-scale solar power plants. In April, the Electricity Authority introduced a supplementary tariff for low-voltage solar plants integrated with energy storage systems. And in March, the government introduced new provisions that authorize bilateral PPAs between independent power producers and final clients.
The country has already about 5 GW of PV. Its renewables target is 20% of generation by 2025 and 30% by 2030. Extrapolated from the current situation, this corresponds to about 17 GW of solar generation.

“Our work is a proof of concept, and we are consistently working on advanced results,” corresponding co-author Monika Rai, told pv magazine, noting that the proposed approach is solvent-free and industrially scalable.
They used an industrial nanosecond pulsed ultraviolet (UV) laser at two different energy intensities of 160 nJ and 650 nJ, respectively.
They then utilize scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements to evaluate the effect of the laser pulse on the morphology of the film and found that both intensities result in a uniform grain size distribution and clear grain boundaries, although the higher intensity also showed some degraded perovskite grains.
By contrast, the laser pulse with the lower intensity did not damage the perovskite surface or affected any bulk properties of the perovskite thin film. “There is no observable difference in the binding energy or broadening of the spectra at the low laser energy, which suggests a negligible change in the chemical properties at the perovskite surface,” the researchers said. “At high laser energy, the overall absorption decreases due to obvious destruction in the film, as supported by XRD and SEM measurements.”
The team applied the treatment to a solar cell based on triple-cation cesium methylammonium formamidinium (CsMAFA) and found its efficiency grew from 18.0% to 19.3%, with the stability performance being also improved. “At optimized energy, the laser-polished devices show improved open-circuit voltage (VoC) and fill factor, owing to reduced interface recombination losses, unlocking the potential of high Voc from the perovskites of similar bandgaps,” they said, adding that the cell achieved a remarkable Voc of 1.21 V.
The cell was able to retain around 90% of its initial efficiency for 1,000 h compared to 75% for a reference device to which the laser treatment was not applied.
“This technique may be particularly suitable for roll-to-roll (R2R) production lines,” co-author Micahel Saliba told pv magazine.
Details on the approach, the laser power fine-tuning, and the measurement methods are documented in “Light Makes Right: Laser Polishing for Surface Modification of Perovskite Solar Cells,” published in ACS Energy Letters. The research group includes scientists from the University of Stuttgart and the Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus–Senftenberg in Germany, the University of Luxembourg, and the University of Valencia in Spain.

German energy asset manager CEE Group and project developer Goldbeck Solar have switched on a 155 MW solar power plant in Gumtow, Germany.
The Döllen solar farm, built in one year, sells power to French energy company Engie under a 10-year power purchase agreement (PPA), as confirmed by the two companies.
The project, situated on a former agricultural site, was built by Goldbeck Solar in collaboration with German engineering company Antilike Solar. Financing was provided by DAL Deutsche Anlagen-Leasing GmbH & Co. KG. Chinese module maker Astronergy supplied the panels.
The electricity is being integrated into the network of E.DIS Netz AG, a regional electricity distribution network operator serving Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. E.DIS built a substation in Schönhagen specifically for the solar park. The commercial law firm Taylor Wessing and the consulting firm 8.2 Obst & Ziehmann were involved as legal and technical advisoes for the transaction.
“Particular challenges had to be overcome during the construction of the solar park, which were related, among other things, to the subsoil, the weather conditions, and the power supply during the implementation of the project,” said  Goldbeck Solar Group CEO Joachim Goldbeck. “In addition, the geopolitical events of the past few months have disrupted supply chains.”

In his paper “A comprehensive review of water based PV: Flotavoltaics, under water, offshore & canal top,” published in Ocean Engineering, Aritra Ghosh described the technical features of four different types of WPV systems – underwater, floating, offshore, and canal top – and presented the impact of ambient factors on their performance.
“Floating photovoltaics (FPV) are more common now for investigation and are most often installed on a stationary water body globally such as lakes or ponds while canal top is popular in India,” he explained.
Much research has been conducted on FPV for shallow water and offshore as it provides significant positive attributes such as low operating solar cell temperature and enhanced electrical efficiency, no requirement of expensive land cost, and relatively less affected by dust and shading. While the paper offers highlights of studies into the benefits and efficiency of underwater PV, offshore PV, and FPVs, Ghosh said that intense research studies and cost analyses for canal top PVs are not widely available.
For this review, Ghosh utilized relevant databases ─ including Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science ─ to investigate literature that had been published over the past few decades. The Scopus database, which is operated by Elsevier, covers citation and abstract information specifically for peer-reviewed literature, such as scientific journals, books, and conference proceedings.
“Knowledge of the ecological impacts of WPV systems is limited. Currently, most scientific work has focused on technological advancements, rather than the impacts on the environment,” the study points out. “Careful planning is essential before placing a WPV system to minimize natural damage and improve the environmental impact.”
The paper stresses the important role WPV can play as a “third pillar in the global solar energy market” along with ground-mounted and building-integrated PV. However, the success of WPV will require public support. Ghosh specifically mentions the use of underwater PV in swimming pools as a case where people will need to understand the benefits, due to the higher initial cost. “Currently, no such study is reported that can tackle a particular area and perform a societal implication study for WPV.”
Ghosh concludes that significant knowledge sharing is vital and “various stakeholders such as PV, marine, ocean and water research bodies should work together to find out the simpler solution for WPV application in future.”
