The top three states with the most small-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity at the end of 2020 were California (10.6 GW), New Jersey (1.9 GW), and Massachusetts (1.8 GW).
Of the 4.5 GW of small-scale solar capacity added in the United States in 2020, California accounted for 31%, the largest share by far.
And although Texas and Florida have less total small-scale solar capacity than either California or New Jersey, capacity has grown rapidly in recent years. In 2020, Texas added 422 MW of small-scale solar, and Florida added 282 MW. State incentives, strong solar resources, and policy changes are largely driving these gains.
The rankings were reported by the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration (EIA), which defines “small scale” as any installation that is connected to the grid and is less than 1 MW in size.

New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts are leaders for small-scale solar capacity despite having less favorable solar resources. In these states, long-standing state policies such as renewable and clean energy standards and other incentives, some of which include specific provisions for solar, encourage small-scale solar capacity growth.
In 2020, small-scale solar capacity in Texas grew by 63%, increasing from 670 MW in 2019 to 1,093 MW. EIA said that Texas does not require utility companies to buy excess energy from residential solar panels. As such, net metering– which allows customers who generate their own electricity to sell excess electricity back to the grid–is not available to many Lone Star State homeowners. Some retail electricity companies, however, offer a renewable buyback program in the form of bill credits. And, the state offers a property tax exemption for the added home value from rooftop solar installations, encouraging small-scale solar growth in the state, EIA said.
Removing restrictions on leased solar systems has encouraged small-scale solar growth in Florida. Until April 2018, the Florida Public Service Commission restricted electricity sales from leased solar systems. Without that restriction, electricity customers can now lease solar systems with little or no upfront costs, making solar PV more widely economic and resulting in big growth. In 2020, small-scale solar capacity there grew 57%, from 492 MW in 2019 to 773 MW.
Although not in the top states for total small-scale solar capacity, Illinois added 309 MW of small-scale solar capacity in 2020, the third-highest number of additions, according to EIA. The additions doubled small-scale solar capacity in the state from 206 MW in 2019 to 515 MW in 2020.

Western Australia-based gold and nickel explorer Province Resources last month unveiled its HyEnergy Renewable Hydrogen Project, including plans for a 1 GW wind and solar PV facility to be established in the Gascoyne Region of Western Australia. The energy from that project will be used to produce approximately 60,000 tons of green hydrogen per year or up to 300,000 tons of green ammonia.
The Perth-based company, which enjoyed a major boost to its stock price in the wake of the HyEnergy announcement, this week revealed that within four weeks it will deploy a monitoring station at the proposed site to accelerate data collection required to support feasibility studies.
Province Resources managing director David Frances said the data collected will enable the proposed solar array network and wind turbines to be optimized prior to the final project scope and scale decision point.
“It is great to be able to hit the ground running on the exciting HyEnergy green hydrogen project,” he said. “I look forward to progressing the feasibility studies as quickly as possible, whilst also planning the initial fieldwork programs to assess the salt, potash and mineral sands target areas within the greater Gascoyne Project.”
Province has declared the proposed location, near Canarvon in the state’s north-west, is ideal for the development of a large-scale renewable energy facility but said the monitoring station, provided by Sydney-based technology company Fulcrum3D, will collect preliminary wind and solar data every 10 minutes within the project area to assess the wind and solar resource potential.
Data already provided by Province indicates Canarvon’s solar is amongst the highest irradiance in the world, averaging 211 sunny days per year with an average solar exposure of 22 Mj or 6.24 kWh per day. And, due to being on the western edge of the continent, it has excellent wind resources.
The company said it will utilize Fulcrum3D’s Sodar (Sonic Detection and Ranging) weather monitoring system.
Fulcrum3D general manager Jo Hume told pv magazine reliable data is essential for effective project design and management – from both a technical and financial point of view. “Accurate resource assessment for wind and solar energy developments is critical for bankability and risk management and for ensuring optimal power plant design,” she said.
Province said it will look to commence feasibility studies for both renewable power generation and green hydrogen production within the next 12-18 months.
The company isn’t the only enterprise eyeing the development of a renewable hydrogen project in Western Australia. The state government has given environmental approval to the first stage of the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, a 15 GW hybrid solar and wind plant. The approval is a massive step forward for the project, which is backed by Sydney-based developer CWP Renewables and Macquarie Group.
Hydrogen Renewables Australia and Denmark Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) have also proposed the development of a renewable hydrogen production facility near Kalbarri. They have detailed plans for up to 5 GW of combined solar and wind projects to supply it.

The Colombian government has introduced the obligation for power distributors to acquire clean energy.
Resolution 40715 has now been approved by Colombia’s Ministry of Energy and Mines and mandates that all power companies operating in the wholesale energy market ensure at least 10% of the power they distribute has come from renewables.
The annual obligation will come into force from January 1, 2022.
The resolution, the draft version of which was put out to consultation in 2019, stipulates power companies must procure the clean energy concerned under long-term contracts lasting at least a decade and registered with the Administrator of the Commercial Exchange System.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Colombia had 90 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2019. The country, however, is expected to register strong growth in new renewable energy capacity between 2020 and 2022, as a result of a first auction held in October 2019, in which 2.2 GW of wind and solar combined was allocated, and the distributed generation segment, for which new rules were introduced in March 2018.
According to Colombia‘s Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME), there are currently 385 projects totaling 15 GW at different stages of development, including 4 biomass, 17 wind, 93 hydro, 271 photovoltaic and 7 thermal.
The 271 photovoltaic projects currently being planned, developed or built in the country have a combined capacity of 8,855 MW. Of those, 54 were initiated in 2018, 159 last year and 58 so far in 2020.

“Around 1,000 applications are expected for a total of 74 grid connection points,” Eren Engur, a board member and president of the energy storage committee at the Turkish PV association Günder, told pv magazine. The trade body represents the Turkish Republic in the programs of IEA PVPS (International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems) and includes public and private companies and the Ministry of Energy itself. Engur also specified that all applications will receive feedback within 30 days. 
The tender will be held over a five-day period between March 8-12, 2021. On the first day, 17 grid connection points will be tendered, and on the following two days, the connection points will be 15 and 16, respectively. In the final two days, the connection points will be 15 and 11 respectively.
The projects will be located in 36 cities. The cities of Van, Antalya, Gaziantep, and Mardi will each see 50 MW of allocated capacity, while Ankara and Diyarbakır will be assigned 40 MW each. For Usak, Erzurum, Burdur, Mersin, Osmaniye, Yozgat, Batman, Agri, Aksaray and Adiyaman, the respective allocated capacity is 30 MW each. Other cities will see between 10 and 20 MW of installed solar power.
In a document published in January in the country's official journal, the Turkish government specified that it set a ceiling price of TRY0.35 ($0.047)/kWh for the procurement exercise and that winners will receive a 15-year power purchase guarantee. Domestic content requirements for equipment selection will play an important role in the tender.
The Yeka tender was originally postponed in January 2019 and was initially intended at selecting larger PV projects with a power range between 10 and 50 MW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/04/inverted-blade-coated-perovskite-cell-with-23-2-efficiency/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 4, 2021",Inverted blade-coated perovskite cell with 23.2% efficiency,"Scientists from the University of North Carolina have developed a perovskite solar cell with an efficiency of 23.2% by adding benzylhydrazine hydrochloride (BHC) as an iodine (I) reductant agent in precursor solutions such as methylammonium iodide (MAI) and formamidinium iodide (FAI).
“Preventing the degradation of perovskite precursor solutions is equally important compared to post-fabrication device encapsulation, because large-area perovskite modules are generally manufactured in air and perovskite precursor inks are generally prepared in large quantity and stored for days or months,” the scientists said.
They said that one of the most common issues with precursor materials is that that iodine (I) ions are oxidized into elemental diatomic iodine (I2) during storage. This deteriorates the overall performance of the affected perovskite solar cell, they noted. The group used a low-cost BHC as a reductant, which reduced I2 back to I in aged precursor solutions.
“In addition, the BHC residual in perovskite solid films can reduce the I2 generated during light soaking that induces the shallow charge traps and accelerates the decomposition of perovskite materials,” they said.
Through this process, the academics were able to fabricate an inverted blade-coated p-i-n perovskite cell with the aforementioned efficiency, which was certified by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). It also exhibited operational stability, with almost zero degradation after 1,000 hours of operation at maximum power point (MPP), using a perovskite composition that does not contain cesium. The cell also exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 1.17 V, a short circuit current of 24.0 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 0.829.
“All these results demonstrate the effectiveness of BHC in restoring precursor solutions and reducing film defects, accounting for the suppressed charge recombination and thus enhanced device efficiency,” the researchers said.
They then used the cells to produce perovskite mini-modules with an 18.5% efficiency level, as well as an open-circuit voltage of 11.7 V, a short-circuit current of 73.20 mA, and a fill factor of 0.773. They presented their findings in “Iodine reduction for reproducible and high-performance perovskite solar cells and modules,” which was recently published in Science Advances.
In August, scientists from the University of North Carolina said they had found a new ‘de-doping’ process in perovskite solar cells that could reduce production costs and produce better devices. They have used this to fabricate a mini-module with a 17.8% efficiency rating.

Spain-based CITCEA, a technology transfer center within the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), has developed a new power electronic technology for the management of surplus power in PV installations, which is claimed to be able to combine different storage technologies in a single electronic-based board interface.
The power electronic device is designed to integrate a heterogeneous grouping of storage systems for providing power quality and ancillary services within low voltage grids. It can be connected to the electricity grid and allow the management of the energy generated by a PV system through a set of converters and batteries, which make consumption and injection of surplus solar power into the network more efficient. The technology is said to address maintainability, flexibility, efficiency, fault tolerance, scalability, reliability and controllability to properly operate on the network.
The device is based on algorithms for the prediction of the daily demand and generation of energy and the subsequent planning of the charging and discharging of the batteries. It is said to be able to analyze data that makes it possible to anticipate congestion issues in the network or the variations in voltage that can affect the quality of the power supply for the PV system operator.
“This technology will facilitate the local consumption of renewable energy generation and will avoid the transport of the generated electricity away from consumption, contributing to a much more efficient energy system,” CITCEA said. “The performance of this device will be supported by a better observation of the network and artificial intelligence algorithms that, based on this information, will allow, on the one hand, to predict the demand and generation of energy at critical points of the network and, on the other hand, to optimally operate the grid and the energy flows with different time horizons.”

The device was developed through the EU-funded 3-year project Renewable penetration levered by Efficient Low Voltage Distribution grids (RESOLVD), which was launched in 2017.  It was coordinated by Spain's Control Engineering and Intelligent Systems (eXiT) and includes, along with the CITCEA, the Institute of Informatics and Applications of the University of Girona (UdG), Spanish power distributor Estonell Distribución, the Joanneum Research research center in Austria, Greek telecommunications company Intracom Telecom, Slovenian technology company Comsensus, and the Smart Innovation Norway research center. 
The project was financed with funds from the European Commission, within the framework of the Horizon 2020 program.

German thin-film solar module manufacturer Avancis claims to have achieved a new world record efficiency for a completely encapsulated copper, indium, gallium, and selenium (CIGS) module with an integrated series connection measuring 30×30 cm.
The 19.64% efficiency was certified for a panel with an aperture area of 671 cm2 by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). The previous record for a CIGS module of this size was 19.16%.
Avancis CTO, Jörg Palm, said the increase in efficiency is due to the improved homogeneity of the CIS formation process, the optimal coordination of the properties of the individual functional layers, and a reduction in reflection losses.
The panel, which was developed by Avancis in its German research center in Munich, is based on a CIGS absorber, a sodium-based post-treatment of the absorber, and a cadmium-free sputtered zinc oxysulphide buffer. All essential processes are compatible with the commercial production of large-area CIGS modules, emphasized the German manufacturer.
Avancis has been part of the Chinese state-owned company CNBM since 2014, one of the world's largest groups in the field of glass and building materials production with over 300,000 employees. Avancis' head office is located in Torgau, in the German region Saxony, with additional locations in Munich and in Ochang, South Korea.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/04/silver-currently-accounts-for-10-of-pv-module-costs/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 4, 2021",Silver accounts for 10% of PV module costs,"The share of silver in PV module costs has risen by around 5% in recent months to account for approximately 10% of the total, according to U.S.-based analyst Matt Watson.
“With PV module costs in the neighborhood of $0.018-$0.019/watt and silver representing around 10% of the overall module cost structure, and module and cell prices still declining, finding a means to lower the silver cost component is going to become an increasingly difficult task,” Watson told pv magazine. “Over the past 20 years, silver has averaged an 8.31% year-on-year growth in prices, which is greater than the current rate of design thrifting. This means lowering that silver $/watt component is going to be very difficult.”
Watson noted that silver is now sold at around $26 per ounce, but said that prices will continue to climb.
“When you study the silver market, electronics demand, led by the Solar PV markets, all have increasingly larger forecast demand,” he said, noting that silver is becoming more of an industrial metal with each passing year. “The projected solar PV module silver cost per watt produced is leveling out going forward as a result of these silver price climbs … As other cell and module costs decline, silver will consume an even larger percentage of the overall module cost as these trends continue.”
Watson, a former executive at U.S.-based CIGS solar module manufacturer SoloPower, is currently the CEO and founder of California-based Precious Metals Commodity Management LLC. He said he believes that the PV industry will probably not move away quickly from the use of silver, despite the recent jump in silver prices.
“In my career, I did extensive work on alternatives alloys without any real success,” he said. “Life testing and electrical efficiency losses always brought us back to silver alloys.”
Watson said that engineering teams use precious metals in electronics for a reason.
“Silver of course is the most conductive mineral in the world, with good corrosion resistance properties assisting the durability of the module,” he added.
He acknowledged that nickel alloy has the potential to replace silver in solar cell metallization, but not in the space of a few years.
“We may need a couple of decades to get there,” he said, noting that in the connector market, copper and copper-nickel alloys are commonly used for both durability and electrical performance
In 2025, when around 230 GW of new capacity is expected, the industry will need 156 Moz, or 15% of the global silver supply.
“And this considering all of the silver design thrifting baselines,” Watson said. “With the growth in other electronics applications, I’m sure the real silver supply continuity pinch point is around 30% of the global silver supply. But at present course, we will hit that 30% silver demand level by around 2046.”
On the current solar PV market growth trajectory, by 2050 some 332 Moz of silver will be needed to support 1.33 TW/year of new installations.
“Clean energy voices calling for an even steeper growth in solar PV, to as high as 3 TWs to 4 TWs a year by 2050,” Watson concluded.  “This trajectory of growth would break the silver market without substantial mining growth.”

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has issued a recall notice for batteries in LG Energy Solution's lithium-ion RESU residential range, due to the risk of overheating.
The independent statutory authority said that LG Energy Solution’s RESU7H_Type R, RESU10, RESU10H Type-C, RESU10H_Type R, EM048063P3S4, and EM048126P3S7 home batteries will be recalled in Australia due to the risk of the batteries overheating and catching fire.
“The affected batteries are equipped with cells from specific production lots manufactured between March 2017 and September 2018,” the ACCC said. “If the batteries overheat, there is an increased risk of fire which may result in an injury or death and/or property damage.”
The ACCC’s move formalizes the South Korean battery manufacturer’s voluntary Australian recall issued last month after reports of “thermal events” in the United States.
LG Energy Solution said it had received “isolated reports” about overheating incidents linked to home BESS installations.
“As a precautionary measure and out of an abundance of caution, LG Energy Solution has decided to replace all potentially affected home batteries, equipped with cells from limited specific production lots, free of charge,” the company said, adding that products included in the recall will be replaced free of charge.
The company said it is also implementing a remote software upgrade for a number of affected RESU10H Type-R and RESU7H Type-R units to lower the maximum state of charge to 90% until they can be replaced. The upgrade is only applicable to online units that have sufficient online connectivity to be able to receive the software upgrade.
The recall is a setback for LG Energy Solution, which has been planning to roll out the third iteration of its RESU home batteries, including “the industry’s largest home battery,” the RESU16H Prime 16 kWh battery pack. The new Prime line-up was scheduled to arrive in Australia later this month.

White Pine Renewables has completed a floating solar array in northern California that the company claims is the largest such project in the United States.
The 4.8 MW Healdsburg Floating Solar Project was installed on ponds at a wastewater treatment plant in Healdsburg, California. It will deliver energy to the city under under a 25-year power purchase agreement.
The company chose the project site and floating PV approach to help reduce evaporation and algae growth at the ponds. The electricity will cover around 8% of the city’s total energy demand and move it toward its goal of 60% renewable energy usage before 2030.
Noria Energy co-developed the project with White Pine and provided installation services. The behind-the-meter project’s entire installation, from procurement to commissioning, was completed in less than six months.
Bragging rights
The Healdsburg Floating Solar Project can apparently claim the title as largest floating solar project in the United States. The previous claimant was a 4.4. MW floating array in Sayreville, New Jersey, installed by Ciel & Terre USA. That project, just outside of New York City, is also sited on a pond at a municipal water treatment facility.
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL) has pegged floating solar as a “rapidly emerging technology.” It has also outlined the technology’s potential to produce just under 10% of current electricity generation. In addition, the technology offers generally higher energy production, due to the cooling effects of water and wind.
According to Stetson Tchividjian, director of business development at floating PV developer D3Energy, the adoption of floating solar could rise as it reaches price parity with land-based PV. Tchividjian also noted that floating solar has lower operational and management costs, as well as no land costs.
