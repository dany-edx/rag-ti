They used a photoelectrode with a tantalum nitride nanorod structure and a dual copper-indium-selenium (CuInSe2) solar cell with a platinum-nickel electrocatalyst for hydrogen generation. The system's tandem configuration achieved a reproducible STH efficiency of approximately 12% – the highest among photocatalytic materials. Although promising for commercialization, the researchers said that further work is needed to enhance the photoanode's stability and protection.
NewHydrogen has partnered with UC Santa Barbara to research an efficient thermochemical water splitting process for green hydrogen production using heat. CEO Steve Hill noted the cost-effectiveness of renewable heat sources like concentrated solar and geothermal, including waste heat from various industrial processes and power plants.
University of Warwick researchers, in collaboration with scientists from the University of Manchester, have demonstrated the unexpected permeability of graphene to protons, proving that its crystalline structure accelerates proton transport. They outlined their findings in “Proton transport through nanoscale corrugations in two-dimensional crystals,” which was recently published in Nature. They said that their use of scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) revealed proton currents accelerated around nanoscale wrinkles, providing greater permeation space through the crystal lattice.
Schmid Group has secured n equipment order from an undisclosed green hydrogen company. The German specialist said it will provide equipment for one of the world's largest electrolysis factories. Wet chemical plant systems will be supplied under the contract, which is scheduled for installation in the first half of 2024. “The machines play an important role in the production of central components made of stainless steel, which are subsequently assembled into stacks during further processing,” said Schmid Group. “These stacks will in turn be integrated into the electrolysers used to produce green hydrogen.”

Amidst an ongoing heatwave in southern France, Sun'Agri, a French agrivoltaics specialist, has released its latest findings on the impacts of its technology on water resource management.
The company conducted an analysis on the effects of solar panels on apple, cherry, and nectarine trees across three sites in La Pugère, Etoile sur Rhône, and Loriol, southern France. The study demonstrated that the PV installations reduced temperature and increased relative humidity for the crops underneath the panels during hot weather, compared to reference areas without protection.
At the La Pugère site, shading from the panels resulted in a decrease of air temperature by 3.8 C and an increase in relative humidity of up to 14% between 2019 and 2021. On average, July temperatures were lowered by 1.2 C, and relative humidity increased by 2% over the same period.
The company also found that the agrivoltaic system contributed to water conservation, with irrigation inputs being up to 30% lower compared to reference areas (average reduction of 22% between 2019 and 2021). The reduction in irrigation was observed using flow meters installed along irrigation pipes. Control trees received more irrigation water to maintain water comfort.
The study also showed that water availability in the soil decreased less under the agrivoltaic structure. This effect was attributed to the microclimate regulation in the shade of the panels, which provided favorable conditions for the plants and reduced transpiration and irrigation.
In addition, Sun'Agri reported that the water status of apple trees under the agrivoltaic structure remained superior to that of the control zone throughout the summer. During daylight hours, the water potential of apple trees under photovoltaic panels remained around 20% higher than that of the reference area, reflecting better water comfort for shaded trees despite reduced water supply.
These findings were supported by various indicators, including a decrease in potential evapotranspiration and a 63% reduction in water stress compared to the reference area, particularly during the intense heatwave in July 2019.
At the Etoile sur Rhône site, where nectarines are cultivated, temperature differences of 2 C to 3 C were recorded on a windless summer day in August 2022. Additionally, the company observed a 25% decrease in irrigation under the agrivoltaic system compared to the control area.
On the Loriol cherry farm, the minimum summer water status under agrivoltaics was around 30% to 40% more favorable than that of the control cherry trees, as measured on Aug. 31, 2022.) was also more favorable under agrivoltaics than that of the control cherry trees by around 30% to 40%.

German battery manufacturer Voltfang has expanded its product range with a turnkey outdoor battery solution. The company said that the capacity of the new product is between 33 kWh and 644 kWh.
“This makes them ideal for applications such as charging stations and infrastructure projects with low space requirements, as well as for manufacturing companies with limited space,” it said in a statement.
The manufacturer stated that the storage system boasts effective insulation and operates within a temperature range of -20°C to 50°C. It incorporates a sturdy housing with a double wall that shields it from sunlight, rain, and other environmental elements, while the inverter is directly attached to the housing. Voltfang has integrated its proprietary energy management system into the storage unit, creating an all-in-one outdoor solution.
“The Voltfang Outdoor System is the perfect solution for using storage capacity outdoors without losing power. We have developed a complete solution that is ready to use and does not require complex installation,” said Voltfang CEO, David Oudsandji. “The storage is designed to withstand extreme climatic conditions, whether Spain's blazing midday sun or Scandinavia's winter.”
The Aachen-based company utilizes recycled electric vehicle batteries to manufacture stationary storage systems. It estimates the battery lifespan through specialized software, and these devices reportedly achieve a comparable service life to new systems. Voltfang has already implemented some of its systems at various commercial facilities in Germany.

“We provided large film-based perovskite PV module as experimental materials for demonstrations,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine, referring to a project conducted at the Aobadai station in Yokohama that includes analyzing indoor performance.
The latest efficiency result is a large improvement on the 15.1% efficiency that Toshiba achieved for the module in September 2021.
The device is fabricated through a one-step coating method that uses improved ink, film drying processes, and production equipment to form a uniform perovskite layer. The process is said to halve the steps for deposition of the MAPbI3 perovskite layer. The coating speed is said to reach six meters per minute on a 5×5 cm2 module, which the company defined as a rate that meets requirements for mass production.
The flexible and lightweight panel is indicated by Toshiba as suitable for locations where it is difficult to install conventional crystalline silicon modules, such as low-load-bearing roofs and office windows.
The company has stated in the past that it plans to commercialize its perovskite technology in 2025.

Analysis of Historical Time Series data from El Niño years using the Solcast API, shows that irradiance is significantly impacted in these years.
The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has declared that we are in El Niño's Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phase, and that there is a 90-95% probability this will continue into the upcoming winter.
NOAA has further forecast a 60% chance that this will be a “strong event,” so solar producers across the continent should be anticipating this to change their expected performance through the winter.
Analysis of December-February months from previous El Niño events (2006-07, 2009-10, 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2018-19) shows the historic impact on global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). This image shows a comparison of the average GHI in the El Niño episodes with the neutral and La Niña phases of the ENSO climate cycle.

The clear observation is that most of the Continental US experienced reduced irradiance during El Niño winters. California, the Midwest, Southern states, and Mexico in particular see higher precipitation, as well as cloudier conditions.
Conversely, the North-eastern USA and neighboring Canadian provinces depict the opposite. These regions experienced increased irradiance during El Niño intervals.
This trend correlates with decreased precipitation during such periods, another trend these regions might expect in the coming winter.
As the solar energy sector leads into the lower-producing winter months, El Niño is likely to bring even lower than normal production through winter. The increased rain may result in decreased dust soiling for panels that aren't already being cleaned regularly.
Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

The scientists said that heat pumps could achieve significant cost savings when they push surplus heat into district networks, based on a case study of six buildings in Espoo, Finland. The buildings were all connected to the local district heating network, with air-to-water heat pumps being modeled to work in parallel with the network.
The Finnish group outlined nine scenarios for combined heat production, factoring in base and peak demand from heat pumps and centralized heating. They also considered the option of selling excess heat. The study calculated cost-effective heat production strategies for each hour, based on demand and short-term operational expenses.
According to the researchers, heat pumps provided up to 76% of the heat in July, Finland's hottest month, while this figure decreased to 36% during the coldest month, February.
“When optimizing heat delivery operational expenditure of the hybrid heating, the cost-optimal choice would be to dimension heat pumps to cover the peak heat demand,” the group said, adding that the parallel use of heat pumps and district heating is crucial to achieving a cost-optimal outcome. “Minimum opex is achieved by dimensioning the HP system for peak heat demand, which is the highest accepted dimensioning in the modeling. However, if HP capex is considered in total heat delivery costs, it is not economic to invest in HPs in the studied case.”
The researchers said that adding heat pumps to the district heat network increased total heat delivery costs.
“This maintenance/replacement investment should be analyzed further in order to make more thorough conclusions regarding the profitability of investing in heat pumps in district heat systems,” they stated.
They presented their findings in “Cost-optimization model to design and operate hybrid heating systems – Case study of district heating system with decentralized heat pumps in Finland,” which was recently published in Energy.
“The future work of developing the modelling tool is to focus on expanding the scope to larger systems (area, municipality, country) as well as including alternative heat pump technologies, storage technologies and heat demand response into the model,” they concluded.

Multiple sources confirmed they saw lower pricing for non-China polysilicon being signed.
One global producer sold polysilicon this month at around $27/kg, and will do so at even lower prices next month, to a major solar manufacturer, according to a source at the latter.
Some sources expressed surprise at the falling prices and could not offer explanations as to why. One source’s comments proved representative of many: “There is a lot of demand for non-China poly,” so “we are not really clear on why” global producers have reduced their prices. Even some sources expressed doubt, stating that it is improbable that the aforementioned global producer will have lowered prices below $30/kg.
“My guess is that customers cannot absorb the big price difference between China and non-China polysilicon anymore” and have pushed for lower figures, a solar market veteran said. Although there are a lot of plans for ingot and wafer capacity in the U.S., moving forward, “the only demand today” is from big Chinese buyers, he added.

Reflecting how the global and China polysilicon markets are essentially bifurcated, this week saw them move in opposite directions. China Mono Grade, OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon in the country, extended gains for a seventh week running to CNY73.75 ($10.12)/kg.
The 2.57% increase comes as the available supply of China polysilicon is lower than expected. Prices for the material are increasing slowly because of how inventories have been consumed in recent days, and “the slow rate at which new production capacity is being added,” a source explained.
Looking ahead, China polysilicon prices could edge upwards a little more, before ultimately decreasing on the overall picture of oversupply that remains on the horizon. Traders are taking off-grade material again, “which means that prices will be stable or even rise slightly in the next 1-2 months,” according to a market veteran. More broadly, once all new polysilicon production capacity slated to come online this year does, price increases will see a reversal.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

“The concept of DPP has emerged as a prominent solution for mitigating the mismatch problem in photovoltaic (PV) strings comprising several elements,” the research corresponding author, Fernando Lessa Tofoli, told pv magazine. “Its main advantage lies in the ability to process only the power difference between series-connected PV modules, often constituting a minor portion of the total generated power. It is noteworthy that DPP converters are connected in parallel with the modules, this being a scalable solution.”
He also explained that, currently, two main types of power electronic converters are used to obtain DPP: the bidirectional buck-boost (BBB) converter and the switched capacitor (SC) converter. “The arrangement of these converters within the PV series results in three primary architectures: PV-to-PV, PV-to-Bus, and hybrid configurations,” he stated, noting that the proposed DPP converter consists of a hybrid topology that combines the PV-to-PV and PV-to-Bus architectures, thus incorporating elements from both BBB and SC converters.
In a PV-to-bus DPP configuration, a boost converter is used as the central converter, and the string current is regulated to follow the optimal value to achieve the minimum power losses of DPP converters in a real-time mode. In the PV-to-PV DPP architecture, by contrast, the converters are connected in parallel with the PV string to improve power yield.
“Our DPP converter tackles key challenges that impact the PV-to-PV and PV-to-Bus architectures,” said Lessa Toffoli. “Specifically, it addresses issues like the diverted current accumulation in the PV-to-PV architecture and high voltage stresses associated with the PV-to-Bus architecture.”
The proposed approach is said to result in a lower number of components, as only one active switch per module is required, and lower voltage stresses on the semiconductors. “The hard-switching operation of semiconductors in SC converters may lead to high switching losses and poor efficiency,” Lessa Toffoli further explained. “In turn, the introduced solution referred to ReSC converter provides operation under soft-switching conditions while mitigating such undesirable losses.”
Furthermore, the ReSC converter is able to operate under an open-loop condition and will not require additional sensors or complex microcontrollers while relying on simple drivers instead.
“We did not perform an in-depth cost analysis as well, since it falls outside the scope of the work. Anyway, we can positively say that cost will not increase significantly because the converter relies on few semiconductors and passive elements, all of which have low-power ratings,” said Lessa Toffoli. “A return on investment analysis could show that payback time is short compared with the lifespan of the modules while considering the significant increase in energy harvesting.”
Looking forward, the research group said that a patent request is currently under review.
The novel approach was presented in the study “Differential power processing architecture to increase energy harvesting of photovoltaic systems under permanent mismatch,” published in Solar Energy. The research group is composed of scientists from the Federal University of Itajubá and the Federal University of São João del-Rei.

Boston-based startup Form Energy recently announced it has been awarded a $12 million grant from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to deploy a 10 MW/1000 MWh pilot battery project in New York by 2026. This will be Form Energy’s first grid-scale project in the state following similar announcements in Colorado and Minnesota.
Form Energy’s iron-air battery technology can deliver 100 hours of discharge at system costs competitive with conventional power plants. The multi-day duration positions it well to help New York meet its ambitious clean energy targets – a clean grid by 2040.
NYSERDA awarded the grant as part of its $17 million long-duration energy storage program, intended to accelerate commercialization of promising long-duration technologies. New York has set a goal of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 and will need technologies like multi-day storage to ensure reliability during extended lulls in wind and solar generation.
“Our analysis indicates that multi-day storage has significant potential to help New York meet its decarbonization and grid reliability goals,” said Mateo Jaramillo, CEO of Form Energy. “This grant allows us to accelerate deployment of our first multi-day battery system in New York and sets the path for us to deliver further multi-day storage projects in the State in the future.”
An analysis recently released by Form Energy provides further evidence that multi-day energy storage like its iron-air technology can substantially reduce the costs for New York to achieve its ambitious decarbonization targets.
The analysis used advanced modeling techniques to compare multiple scenarios with varying availability of energy storage durations. It found that including both long-duration (10 to 24 hour) and multi-day (>24 hour) storage in the mix of resources available to meet New York’s goals reduces total system costs in 2040 by 29% compared to relying solely on short-duration lithium-ion batteries.
In the models with only short-duration lithium-ion batteries available, over 60 GW of battery capacity is built by 2040 to shift renewable generation and meet peak demand. However, this capacity only provides 538 GWh of energy storage.
Whereas when long-duration and multi-day storage are available, total storage capacity needs drop to around 40 GW. But critically, total energy storage capacity grows nearly 10x to over 5,000 GWh. These large energy reserves allow the grid to smooth multi-day variability in renewable generation. The emphasis on iron-air storage also avoids the potential fire-hazard of lithium batteries. According to Julian Spector at Canary Media, three separate fires at lithium battery facilities in New York owned by Nextera and Convergent Energy have left the state’s Governor Hochul scrambling to assure local residents that the transition to a clean grid is safe and healthy.
Models show 35 GW of multi-day storage capacity is optimal by 2040. This includes 19 GW of iron-air batteries (or equivalent) plus 16 GW of hydrogen storage. In tandem with 4 GW of lithium-ion batteries and pumped hydro storage, this diverse portfolio of storage durations provides the flexibility to shift renewable energy across multiple timescales.
Multi-day storage charges during periods of excess renewable generation and then discharges steadily for days or weeks during extended lulls, effectively firming the variable output. For example, during one modeled offshore wind lull, wind generation was only 33% of average for a full week. Multi-day storage supplied 16% of total demand that week by drawing from its vast energy reserves.
This ability to firm renewable generation translates into major cost savings. With multi-day storage available, models show New York’s 2040 electric system can be decarbonized with 22% less lithium-ion storage capacity, 36% less nuclear generation, and 6% less solar capacity. The 29% cumulative cost reduction underscores the value provided by long-duration and multi-day storage.
Additionally, the avoided build-out of solar, nuclear and short-duration batteries reduces land use needs and transmission investments. So multi-day storage confers environmental benefits as well as direct economic savings.
The analysis shows long-duration storage begins providing significant value as early as 2030. Including 4.8 GW of multi-day storage in 2030 resource plans reduces costs by 6% annually, while avoiding the need for 5 GW of <10 hour batteries and 5 GW of solar generation. This demonstrates near-term policy support will be crucial to accelerate deployment of emerging long-duration storage technologies in the next 5-7 years.
Overall, the white paper provides compelling evidence that long-duration and multi-day energy storage can cost-effectively firm New York’s growing renewable generation, ensuring a reliable grid during the transition to 100% carbon-free electricity. Form Energy’s iron-air battery is well-suited for this application and the NYSERDA grant will facilitate demonstration of a pilot system by 2026.
Looking ahead, Form Energy projects New York will require at least 3 GW per year of new multi-day storage capacity between 2030 and 2040. Near term policy action to establish incentives, market mechanisms and contract structures will give the private sector needed market signals to invest in manufacturing and project development for emerging technologies like iron-air batteries. Then these resources can be deployed at scale to maximize cost savings and grid reliability as New York pursues its ambitious decarbonization timeline.

The recycled material reportedly offers performance comparable or superior to HTLs based on indium tin oxide (ITO) or those made with PEDOT:PSS, a polymer known for its low cost and easy preparation properties.
“We have come up new approach to address the urgent challenges associated with the depletion of non-sustainable indium tin oxide (ITO) and its unstable charge-extraction interface for solar cells, as well as a range of optoelectronics,” the research's lead author, Chang-Zhi Li , told pv magazine. “The fabrication of a thin InCl3 layer could avoid the use of PEDOT:PSS hole transporting materials. Moreover, this InCl3–ITO electrode can be further recycled.”
The researchers said the InCl3 –ITO HTL has almost identical transmittance spectra as HTLs made of ITO alone and superior performance than PEDOT:PSS.
They built the solar cell with a substrate made of glass and ITO, the InCl3–ITO HTL, a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on a conductive fullerene surfactant known as Bis-FIMG, and a silver metal contact.
The device was tested under illumination conditions and its performance was compared to that of two reference solar cells using HTLs based on ITO and PEDOT:PSS, respectively. The InCl3–ITO-based cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 18.92%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.88 V, and a short-circuit current of 26.12 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 79.34.
The PEDOT:PSS-based cell reached an efficiency of 18.39%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.88 V, and a short-circuit current of 25.24 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 79.57. The device relying on ITO alone achieved an efficiency of 16.08%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.85 V, and a short-circuit current of 24.88 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 73.10.
Furthermore. the scientists found that the InCl3–ITO-based cell was able to retain around 90% of its initial efficiency after 1,000 h. “In sharp contrast, OSCs based on PEDOT:PSS/ITO dramatically decayed to 78% of the initial PCEs in less than 100 h,” they said.
They also scaled up the technology via an aqueous soaking process and built a larger device with an active area of 18.73 cm2 that achieved a power conversion efficiency of 15.2%. “These results represent the top-level performance of binary OSCs and modules so far,” they stated. ” Interestingly, InCl3 –ITO remained stable with the merely changed surface energies under the continuous annealing.”
A complete description of the cell can be found in the paper “Robust and Sustainable Indium Anode Leading to Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells,” published in Advanced Materials.

The CSIRO and Sydney-headquartered RFC Ambrian have co-founded Hadean Energy to advance the development of the CSIRO’s tubular solid oxide electrolysis (SOE) technology. It said the tech could significantly reduce hydrogen production costs and help to decarbonize heavy industry.
The International Energy Agency estimates that demand for hydrogen will increase 138% by 2030, but high production costs and energy inputs are key challenges for producing green hydrogen.
The CSIRO said its SOE technology, which relies on ceramic tubes with electrodes on the inside and out, produces hydrogen by electrolysing water using a combination of heat and electricity. The agency said SOE requires less than 42 kWh of electricity to produce a kilogram of hydrogen while alkaline and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) alternatives require about 60 kWh/kg of hydrogen.
Sarb Giddey, lead scientist on hydrogen research at CSIRO, said the technology has the potential to produce hydrogen at a higher efficiency and lower cost, allowing industry to dramatically reduce emissions.
“It allows industrial waste heat to be integrated back into the industrial processes, which decreases the electrical energy required to produce hydrogen or syn-gas by up to 30%,” he said. “It’s great news for industry, because integrating the hydrogen product back into industrial processes onsite also eliminates storage and transport costs while drastically reducing the use of fossil fuels in the industrial process.”
CSIRO said it will now establish a pilot scale demonstration plant at BlueScope’s Port Kembla Steelworks on the New South Wales south coast to trial the technology in an industrial environment.
RFC Ambrian Chief Investment Officer Stefan Skorut said the technology is well placed to address the existing industrial hydrogen market which is currently almost 100% derived from fossil fuels.
“While SOE is the most efficient method of electrolysis, green hydrogen and synthetic fuels will remain uneconomic unless we address the scalability and cost of electrolysers,” he said. “CSIRO’s tubular SOE technology represents a step change improvement across these metrics.”
The trial with BlueScope will commence in April 2024. The CSIRO said findings from the trial will help to demonstrate the technology at a higher scale and confirm the technical robustness of the equipment. Hadean Energy will have exclusive rights over the SOE technology.

Carbon credits serve as a potent market-driven incentive, effectively catalyzing the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These credits operate within the framework of international agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, thriving within carbon markets where projects designed to curtail emissions yield tradeable credits. These credits, in turn, can be purchased by entities seeking to offset their own emissions, thereby showcasing their unwavering commitment to fostering sustainability. The proportion of global annual greenhouse gas emissions covered by carbon credits has risen from 5% in 2005 to 22% in 2022.

However, the attainment of carbon credits is a formidable achievement, as projects undergo rigorous evaluation by impartial auditors to ensure strict adherence to established standards. Upon successful verification, these credits are introduced into various markets, effectively directing investments toward emission reduction initiatives and sustainable undertakings, particularly within developing nations.
Beyond their symbolic significance, these credits carry tangible benefits, acting as a catalyst in propelling the global transition towards a low-carbon future. By attaching quantifiable value to emission reductions, they serve to invigorate international collaboration in the ongoing battle against climate change. The adoption and incorporation of carbon credits into our practices signify an inspiring journey towards safeguarding our planet and embracing an eco-friendly, sustainable tomorrow.
The popularity of the credits could be estimated by the fact that India alone has a market share of 17% globally with $35.94 million currently (the global market stands at 2 billion). By some estimates, the global carbon credits market would reach $100 billion by the end of 2030 as per Confederation of Indian Industry. It has also been estimated by MarketsAndMarkets that global market size would reach $1,602 billion.

The world of carbon credits thrives under international climate agreements like the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, incentivizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. Diverse emission reduction projects, from renewable energy to waste management, undergo rigorous validation to ensure authenticity. Once verified, carbon credits are issued based on reduced CO2e emissions.
These credits take center stage in carbon markets, where they can be traded voluntarily or for compliance purposes.
Revenue generated from credit sales supports sustainable development and further investment in emission reduction projects. The market dynamics influence carbon credit prices, while their co-benefits include job creation, improved air quality, and advancements toward the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This captivating symphony of carbon credits urges humanity toward a brighter, more sustainable future.
In India, the carbon credit system operates primarily under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The process of carbon credit generation and trading follows a structured flow, adhering to guidelines set by relevant regulatory bodies. The journey begins with Project Identification and Development, where projects contributing to GHG emission reduction are selected. These encompass renewable energy projects, energy efficiency improvements, and waste management schemes, aligning with CDM and regulatory criteria.
The Project Design Document (PDD) is pivotal, outlining the project’s objectives, methodologies, baseline emissions, additionality assessment, and emissions reductions. Validation and Verification are critical turning points, with designated Operational Entities (DOEs) conducting independent assessments and rewarding projects that meet criteria with validation reports. Implementation and Monitoring are essential, with robust systems ensuring accurate emission reduction reporting. Verification and Certification culminate in Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) issuance based on verified emission reductions.
Carbon Credit Trading showcases CERs’ value, drawing entities to offset emissions or meet regulatory commitments. Retirement or Surrender of CERs concludes the journey, ensuring the integrity of emissions accounting. The effectiveness of the system is amplified by the Types of Projects Allowed Under the Carbon Credits Scheme, including Renewable Energy Projects, Energy Efficiency Projects, Waste Management Projects, and Afforestation Projects.
Indian authorities governing carbon credits play a vital role. The Designated National Authority (DNA) endorses projects and provides approval. The CDM Executive Board oversees global projects, ensuring compliance and issuing CERs. Accredited Operational Entities (AOEs) validate and verify projects, while the National CDM Authority coordinates projects within India, offering guidance and support.
While the carbon credit market in India is still in its early stages, it is growing rapidly. As of now, several players issue carbon credits in India:
• The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI): This think tank has issued over 3 million carbon credits from its projects in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors.
• The World Resources Institute (WRI): This non-profit organization has issued over 2 million carbon credits from its projects in the forestry sector.
The carbon credits that these entities have issued can be traded on a variety of exchanges, including the Chicago Climate Exchange, the European Climate Exchange, and the Intercontinental Exchange. Some of the trading places for carbon credits in India are:
• National Stock Exchange (NSE): The NSE launched a carbon trading platform in 2017.
• Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE): The BSE launched a carbon trading platform in 2018.
• Power Exchange India (PXIL): The PXIL launched a carbon trading platform in 2020.
As more and more companies and organizations look to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, the demand for carbon credits is expected to increase.
In the fight against climate change, carbon credits play a significant role in the United States (US), the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), and Australia. The process starts with Project Identification and Development, where projects for emissions reduction are chosen, adhering to country-specific guidelines.
A crucial step involves preparing a comprehensive Project Design Document (PDD) outlining project objectives, methodologies, baseline emissions, additionality assessment, and anticipated reductions. Validation and Verification by accredited Operational Entities (DOEs) ensure compliance and project eligibility. Following approval, projects implement and monitor activities, reporting emissions reductions accurately. Verification and Certification by third-party verifiers lead to the issuance of carbon credits, held in central registries.
Carbon Credit Trading allows developers to trade credits in carbon markets, enabling entities to offset emissions.
Retirement or Surrender of Carbon Credits demonstrates compliance with reduction commitments, ensuring emissions accounting integrity. Regulatory bodies like the EPA (US), BEIS (UK), European Commission, and CER (Australia) oversee carbon credit programs. A variety of projects, from renewable energy to afforestation, contribute to global emissions reduction efforts.
Collectively, these countries incentivize emissions reductions, promoting sustainability for a low-carbon future. Carbon credits prove a powerful tool in combating climate change, inspiring global commitment to environmental preservation. Carbon Pricing Mechanisms have seen a monumental rise since its advent in 1990 as can be seen in figure 2 as per World Bank which clearly shows that companies around the world have embraced carbon credits.

The Indian carbon credit system, operating under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), stands ahead in several aspects:
1. Extensive Use of CDM: India actively utilizes the CDM framework, registering numerous emission reduction projects. Leading in CDM project registrations reflects its proactive stance in adopting clean technologies and attracting international investments.
2. Emphasis on Sustainable Development: India’s system prioritizes sustainable development co-benefits. Projects generating carbon credits must showcase positive impacts on social, economic, and environmental aspects, aligning emission reductions with broader development goals.
3. Inclusion of Diverse Project Types: India’s system covers a wide range of projects, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste management, and afforestation. This comprehensive approach ensures emissions reduction across sectors.
4. National CDM Authority: India has a dedicated authority facilitating and coordinating CDM projects. It streamlines processes, provides guidance, and enhances efficiency.
5. Integration of Policies and Incentives: India implements policies like feed-in tariffs and renewable purchase obligations, creating a favorable environment for renewable energy projects and incentivizing emission reductions, fostering the carbon credit market’s growth.
The Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), outlined in the draft by the Ministry of Power, stands as a pivotal force shaping India’s regulatory framework concerning carbon credits. A significant stride in this direction was taken through the introduction of the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill in 2022, which established the groundwork for the forthcoming Indian carbon credit market. The draft blueprint envisions the establishment of the India Carbon Market Governing Board (ICMGB) as the central entity responsible for the oversight and regulation of the carbon credit market.
This board boasts representation from critical ministries including Environment, Forest, and Climate Change; Power; Finance; New and Renewable Energy; Steel; and Coal. The multifaceted responsibilities of the ICMGB encompass policy formulation, regulatory framework establishment, and trading criteria definition for carbon credit certificates.
Playing a key role within this framework, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) assumes the roles of both the ICM Administrator and Secretariat for the ICMGB. The BEE will be entrusted with devising protocols and processes for project registration under the voluntary mechanism, devising trajectories and objectives for entities operating within the compliance mechanism, as well as the issuance of carbon credit certificates. Additionally, the Bureau will be instrumental in crafting mechanisms to ensure market stability, alongside delineating procedures for Accredited Carbon Verifiers.
The role of the ICM Registry, tasked with maintaining meticulous transaction records and establishing links with other registries, falls under the purview of the Grid Controller of India Limited. Overseeing trading activities and safeguarding the interests of both sellers and buyers, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) is designated as the ICM Trading Regulator. The draft underscores the significance of the compliance mechanism, which obligates entities to curtail GHG emission intensity in adherence to established norms. Complementing this is the envisioned voluntary mechanism, designed for non-obligated entities to enroll on projects aimed at reducing GHG emissions and thereby acquiring carbon credit certificates.
India’s approach gained traction subsequent to COP26, marked by the identification of 12 GHG mitigation activities eligible for trading within the ambit of the Paris Agreement’s Article 6.2 mechanism. This endeavor is oriented towards the creation of a robust domestic market that bridges financial gaps concerning the nation’s ongoing energy transition. Through these initiatives, India showcases a steadfast commitment to the decarbonization of its economy and the fostering of sustainable development in the collective mission to combat climate change.
