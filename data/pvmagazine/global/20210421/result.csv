France's energy regulator the Commission de Régulation de l'Énergie (CRE) has published the feed-in tariffs for rooftop PV installations not exceeding 100 kW in size, for the second quarter of 2021.
The tariff levels are lowered quarter by quarter according to the new capacity for which connection requests were received in the previous three-month period. Different tariffs are applied depending on the project size and location, which can be either on the French mainland, Corsica, or on the nation's overseas territories.
For those PV system owners that will opt for selling all generated power to the grid, the FIT was reduced from €0.1793 to €0.1779/kWh for small-sized arrays not exceeding 3 kW in size; and from €0.1524 to €0.1512/kWh for installations with a capacity of 3-9 kW. Furthermore, the FIT for PV systems ranging in power from 9-36 kW had been reduced from €0.1123 to €0.1095/kWh, and that for projects with a capacity between 36 and 100 kW has been decreased from €0.0976 to €0.0952/kWh.
The FIT payments (Tarif Ta), indicated in MWh, are summarized in the CRE table reproduced below, which also reveals the net metering payments (Tarif Tb) for excess power sold back to the grid – outlined in the bottom half of the graphic.

The CRE also specified that the feed-in tariffs will further drop in the third quarter by 1.35% and 2.46%, respectively, for the 0-9 kWp and the 9-100 kWp categories.
In France’s non-interconnected regions, FIT payments were also slightly reduced.
As the CRE table below illustrates, the Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte will be eligible for a FIT of €0.1610/kWh while France’s South American territory of Guiana will receive a FIT payment of €0.1525/kWh; the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique have been assigned each a FIT of €0.1441/kWh; the Indian Ocean outpost of Réunion will receive a tariff of 0.1356/kWh; and Corsica will have the right to the lowest FIT payment, of €0.1271/kWh

The shortage of materials needed to feed the insatiable global demand for solar modules saw the China Electronics Corp-owned glassmaker bank a net profit for shareholders of RMB220 million (US$33.9 million) in 2020, up from RMB93.1 million a year earlier.
Irico's annual report revealed the profit surge came on the back of a rise in revenue, from the RMB2.25 billion generated in 2019 to RMB2.52 billion, as prices and profit margins rose.
The company was able to shrug off the planned RMB2.3 billion issuance of H-shares, prepared in 2019, which in the event generated only a net HK$1.44 billion (RMB1.2 billion/US$185 million), as business improved later in 2020, and is already laying plans for an issue of A-shares.
The related setback of the abandonment of the third phase of a production expansion project in Xianyang – which was set to be financed by that fundraising exercise – also appears likely to be cast into the shade with Irico New Energy announcing plans in January to establish 10 glass furnaces and associated production lines in Shangrao City. Construction of the initial, three-line phase of that project was slated to have started last month, according to today's annual report, although pv magazine reported last month it was due to begin in the first half of next year.
Most of the numbers in the annual report moved strikingly in the right direction, including current liabilities tumbling from RMB4.19 billion (US$645 million) in 2019 to RMB2.82 billion at the end of last year.
Though the value of the inventories fell RMB9.43 million, the good times in the industry were reflected by the fact Irico paid out only RMB3.97 million in severance payments last year, after a RMB9.54 million redundancy bill a year earlier.
Even with ‘agency fees' leaping from RMB2.94 million in 2019 to RMB15.5 million; insurance costs rocketing from RMB411,000 (US$63,300) to RMB5.47 million; rent and property fees climbing from RMB840,000 to RMB1.35 million, and commission payments going up from RMB1.05 million to RMB4.02 million, there was little to be doleful about in an otherwise glowing 12-month report.

Colombia‘s Ministry of Mines and Energy has submitted to public consultation until next May 4 the draft resolution defining the country's second auction for large-scale renewable energy projects. The procurement exercise, which was originally planned to be held in the past quarter but then delayed due to the Covid-19 crisis, should now take place before the end of October, the ministry specified.
Projects selected in the auctions will be granted 15-year PPAs and will have to begin delivering power in December 2022.
According to National Mining and Energy Planning (UPME) authority, at the end of March, there were around 153 energy projects with a combined capacity of 7,934 MW and planned commissioning dates between 2021 and 2023. Most of these projects may be entitled to compete in the procurement exercise.
The UPME allocated 2.2 GW of solar and wind power generation capacity in the country’s first renewable energy auction, which was finalized in October 2019. The exercise’s final average price was COP95/kWh ($0.026), and the highest bid reached only COP110.
Projects selected in this auction are entitled to a 15-year PPA and must come into operation by January 1, 2022. Contracts are linked to the Colombian peso and updated based on a producer price index certified by Colombia’s National Administrative Department of Statistics.
According to the latest figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency, Colombia had an operational installed PV capacity of around 107 MW at the end of 2020.

The WST-MGL Gemini series is available in two versions with wattages ranging from 365 W to 370 W and power efficiencies between 19.67% and 19.94%.
The panel is made with 120 monocrystalline half-cut cells, measures 1,767×1,050x35mm, and weighs 20.6kg. The open-circuit voltage is between 40.52 V and 40.80 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 111.31 A to 11.39 A. The maximum system voltage for the new product is 1,000 V.
The panel can be used with operating temperatures of between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.35% per degree Celsius. It features an IP68 enclosure rating, an MC4-compatible connector, 3.2mm tempered glass, and a black anodized aluminum frame.
The module comes with a 25-year power output guarantee and is said to be able to operate at 85.28% of its original performance after 25 years. “The Gemini module series already existed with smaller dimensions,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “New is the full black version of the module and that we changed the module dimensions.”
The new product is being produced at the company's manufacturing facility in Hsinchu City, Taiwan.

“We have completed a project in Cape Verde in 2020 and we are now developing [an]other five projects, of which three are expected to be built in 2021,” the company chairman, Franco Traverso, who is also the chairman of the U.S.-Canadian solar module manufacturer Silfab, told pv magazine.
The battery-free reverse osmosis desalination system is fully containerized and thermally insulated. It is able to produce up to 1,000m3 of potable water per day and is claimed to have a life cycle of more than 30 years.

The company's patented technology is said to enable the efficient operation of the desalination unit at variable frequencies, depending on irradiation levels. According to Genius Watter, more than 90% of the available net PV energy is converted to potable water. A storage tank to store water, with a capacity from 50m to 1,000m3 can be also installed within the system's fenced spot and used for water demand during nighttime or on cloudy days. According to Traverso, the desalination unit needs maintenance work only twice a year, which would be required to refill consumables and change filters.
The system is currently available in two versions, for brackish water and seawater desalination. The former version can be built with freshwater output ranging from 20m3 to 500m3 per day and a required PV capacity of 9.6 kW to 241.1 kW. The seawater model may be deployed with the same freshwater capacity and a required PV capacity of 31.6 kW to 709.6 kW.
Image: Genius Watter
Each system has a solar-powered water pumping unit that is able to pump feed water from 250m underground and supply constant pressure to the reverse-osmosis unit. The proposed solution may also be equipped with an automatic chlorination and re-mineralization unit to deliver potable water meeting World Health Organization (WHO) standards. It may also be coupled with an additional power source if constant daily water volumes are necessary.
Genius Watter is offering the desalination solution with its own, patented drone technology for underground water aquifer detection, which is claimed to be able to precisely detect volume, depth, and GPS positioning of water sources at a depth of up to 300m.
The cost of the system, including the PV system, is less than €4000/m3/ day. “For a 90m3/day plant of desalinated brackish water, the turnkey cost of the plant, installed in an African country, would be around €330,000,” Traverso explained, adding that the system is produced in Italy by an undisclosed manufacturer with 30 years of experience in desalination and is then tested at Genius Watter's headquarters in Carmignano di Brenta.

According to the CEO, the system can produce water for agricultural use at an opex of only €0.20/m3.
The company is also considering the possibility of becoming an independent water producer itself through the water-as-a-service financing model. “It is clear that when the water is sold instead of the asset, the sale price of the same increases considerably to leave room for the right margin for the investor who must obtain a reasonable return on his investment,” traverso highlighted. “Even in this case, however, the selling price of the cubic meter of desalinated water is normally competitive, not to mention the advantages of the environmental and social sustainability of the system for obtaining the water and distributing it to users.”
The system is claimed to be particularly suitable for irrigation and livestock farming in semi-desert and coastal areas but also for islands that are affected by a scarcity of fresh water, especially in the summer months when solar radiation is greater.

The city fire station said it received reports of a fire at the Jimei Home Dahongmen store at 12:17 p.m. and dispatched 235 firefighters with 47 fire trucks from 15 fire stations.
The 25 MWhdc battery facility, developed by Beijing Gotion Full-Service Co Ltd and commissioned in March 2019, featured northern and southern sections and the fire station said, while dealing with the blaze at the southern section of the battery, at 14:15 p.m., an explosion occurred in the north section, killing two firefighters and wounding a third. A member of staff of Beijing Gotion Full-Service has been described as missing since the incident.
The battery was part of a system which also featured 1.4 MW of solar generation capacity on the roof of the shopping mall and 94 electric vehicle (EV) parking places with associated charging points. At the time of its commissioning, Beijing Gotion Full-Service described the system as the world's largest user-facing energy storage system; the biggest EV charging station in Beijing city center; the first project to combine PV, storage and EV charging; and the first regional, direct-current, incremental-grid set-up.
Beijing Fire Station said the blaze was extinguished at 23:40 p.m. on Friday and cooling treatment was then carried out.
Hefei-based, Shenzhen-listed battery company Gotion High-tech – the controlling shareholder of Beijing Gotion Full-Service – on Saturday expressed “deep sorrow for the firemen who died in the accident,” to local media, and said it did not participate in the daily operation and management of the battery developer.

That late-December pledge will see the British company able to ship its first-generation, ‘quasi-solid-state' systems, with initial commercial production of the cells and battery systems to take place at Oxis' factory in Port Talbot, Wales.
The manufacturer yesterday announced it will produce quasi-solid-state cells with 450 Wh/kg specific energy and an energy density of 550 Wh/l by next summer, as agreed with Japanese client Sanyo Trading Co Ltd.
With mass production of solid-state devices expected to start at Oxis' factory in Juiz de Fora, Brazil, in 2023, the manufacturer has agreed a target with Sanyo of 550 Wh/kg and 700 Wh/l for the autumn of that year, and is separately aiming to hit 600 Wh/kg and 900 Wh/l by 2026.
Solid-state devices do not feature the organic, highly-flammable electrolyte present in conventional lithium-ion (Li-ion) systems, which has been observed to cause fires in large scale applications and be a cause of concern for aviation companies contemplating electric-powered flight.
Oxis chief executive Huw Hampson Jones, quoted in a press release issued by the company yesterday, said: “Based on our U.S. client base, we know that aircraft manufacturers welcome the move from conventional to solid-state Li-S. Oxis Li-S cell technology is inherently safer than Li-ion, as sulfur acts as a passivation of the lithium metal. Oxis has perfected mechanisms whereby greater levels of safety and longevity are achieved as we move towards roll-out of quasi-solid-state Li-S in 2021/2022. In 2020, Oxis successfully powered an all-electric U.S. aircraft, meeting client and Federal Aviation Authority requirements.”
Lithium-sulfur devices, whether solid-state or conventional, also benefit from not requiring the cobalt, manganese, nickel and copper used in mainstream lithium-ion products, and which pose global supply concerns.
pv magazine has set a new editorial agenda. Via our global UP sustainability initiative, we are diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable; looking at what is already being done and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly investigations have been carried out into topics including the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green financing, and circular manufacturing. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
The Brazilian manufacturing base, which Oxis said last year is being leased from Mercedes Benz, is under preparation, with specialist engineer Nordika Pharmaceutical having started design work on the facility and due to finish that stage of the project this year.
In February last year, Oxis had announced it expected the Brazilian fab to be operational this year but that commissioning date was subsequently pushed back to 2023, with the British company stating in May, the factory would start production with an annual output capacity of 5 million Li-S battery cells.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/21/analysis-of-frances-cre4-pv-tenders-and-their-impact/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,FRANCE",,"APRIL 21, 2021",Analysis of France’s CRE4 PV tenders and their impact,"CRE4 was expected to be a turning point for the French solar industry by giving developers medium-term visibility on the periodicity and volumes called through tenders and by initiating a shift towards a market oriented business model, through the feed-in premium mechanism (known in France as “Complément de Rémunération”).
Looking back over the past four years, a significant drop in tariffs has been observed. Large-scale ground-mounted projects went from €62.5/MWh in March 2017 to €53.4/MWh in February 2021, i.e., an around 15% drop over four years, or 3.9% per year (and notably -5.1%/year for the “large rooftops” category).
Despite the general tendency, tariffs for all categories followed a sinusoidal curve: an initial drop, due to very large candidate volumes and increased competition because developers accumulated large pipelines of projects in anticipation of the CRE4 launch. This was followed by an increase when project pipelines dried up somewhat (some tender sessions were undersubscribed compared to the initial target volumes, particularly for rooftops).
This increase was seen by some as a return to reason following the first period of decline which caused some concerns about the winners’ ability to finance and build the projects. A second period was then observed towards the latter years of CRE4, for which the announcement of the IFER reduction for commissioned projects after January 1, 2021, seems to be the main explanation.
CRE4 has, thus, confirmed the ability of solar energy to provide competitive energy, especially from large-scale ground-mounted plants. Price competitiveness of projects in CRE4 can be appreciated by comparing them to the Hinkley Point remuneration set at GBP 92.50/MWh, or to the wholesale price of electricity observed on the French market in 2020, which is around €42/MWh on average.
The CRE4 program was marked by a strong wave of consolidation led by energy companies and utility majors – both French and foreign – which played a crucial role in the dynamics described above. Foreign entrants will no doubt have been attracted by a French renewables market that has now reached a significant size in the broader context where renewables are increasingly difficult to ignore.
On the other hand, the visibility over future volumes has allowed many developers to implement their development strategy over the medium- to long-term and to engage in significant investment and growth dynamics by carrying out capital increases.
These transactions have mainly been subscribed to by institutional investors or specialized investment funds, which were previously attracted by direct investments in infrastructure assets but are now looking for higher returns, by investing in developers/producers to move up the value chain and thus to improve their yield prospects.
Finally, throughout these tenders, new French and foreign developers have appeared after deciding to enter the market, no doubt attracted by the stable prospects of the support framework. The French market now seems to be more structured and undoubtedly better able to achieve the objectives of the PPE.
CRE4 also provided the opportunity to increase capital deployment into the green economy. Some asset managers created dedicated investment vehicles to address the energy transition market, and those that were already there raised even larger funds that can address more complex markets.
In addition to the consolidation process described above, Finergreen witnessed numerous transactions involving the partial sale of operational portfolios that had reached a critical size, to financial players looking for a stable and secure investment return over the long term. Examples include Caisse des Dépôts' investment in the Tenergie vehicle in 2020, or Predica's investment in the Engie or Total Quadran vehicles in 2021.
The banks, for their part, have played a major role in accelerating the development of the sector by financing projects on increasingly attractive terms. The challenge of integrating solar energy into a market economy via the Complément de Rémunération has finally (and rightly) been resolved without real complexity, giving utilities the opportunity to play the role of aggregators without any impact on bank financing conditions.
These conditions were even significantly improved during this period, with the structuring of financing tenors longer than the duration of the feed-in tariff/premium. This period saw players become increasingly financially sophisticated. The use of various debt products to finance their growth (senior project financing, junior debt, revolving credit, the emergence of Green Bonds, etc.) has enabled developers to innovate and constantly find ways to improve their competitiveness.
The robustness of the sector during a crisis such as Covid-19 is only likely to attract even more capital, and the stock market performance of the French listed players seems to testify to the confidence and interest of investors in the green economy that is increasingly favored by the institutional and political spheres.
The integration of renewable electricity into a market economy was one of the objectives of CRE4. From this point of view, the Complément de Rémunération mechanism will have responded positively to the challenges it faced. However, the transition has only just begun and much remains to be done.
Today, through the CRE's tenders, players have a robust and proven business model that is bankable. As long as these tenders offer sufficient market depth – both in terms of volumes and constraints – the interest in turning to private PPA-type solutions will probably remain limited.
These projects require a more complex structuring and, therefore, more constrained financing (ad-hoc terms and conditions of the negotiated PPA, credit quality of the counter-party, direct exposure to the underlying electricity price, etc.) even though a few symbolic transactions have been carried out in recent months, often justified by (i) the desire to secure a purchase price over a short period of time for assets coming out of the feed in tariff (known as Obligation d’Achat), or (ii) by long-term visions of developing assets not eligible for the tenders while carrying out important CSR communication operations.
While it is likely that participating in the PPE2/CRE5 sessions and obtaining a secured feed-in premium will continue to be a preferred solution for solar PV project developers over the next few years, it is nonetheless clear that an ever-increasing shift towards private PPAs should be anticipated, for several reasons:
All these positive factors in the development of the private PPA market remain, however, subject to the obvious question of the financial feasibility (and therefore ultimate profitability) of PPA projects.
Assuming that a PPA project will save on CAPEX (mainly due to cheaper PV panels) and on OPEX (less competition on land and rents), we observe for a single 50 MW plant the following project IRRs (i.e., before financing) based on a 30-year operating life and a solar captured central merchant curve:
(Notes: CR = remuneration supplement; 53.4 €/MWh corresponds to the average tariff obtained during the last call for tenders, 52.75 €/MWh on average over the previous round; PPA prices are not indexed to inflation)
Based on these assumptions, it is interesting to observe:
We can therefore see that a PPA at €45/MWh, which can be considered in the money when looking at the average electricity prices over 2020 at €42/MWh (with an upward trend), has an intrinsic profitability roughly equivalent to current feed-in premium projects. It is therefore crucial to improve the solutions and vision of long-term financing for PPA projects, as the issue of financing seems to be the last barrier for the accelerated development of PPA projects.
The rest of the story is, thus, partly up to the financiers, who will have to innovate and provide new financing approaches that are more flexible or accommodate better the uncertainty associated with these new models. Even greater attention will have to be paid to the underlying electricity market because it is not only a counter-party risk that will have to be controlled, but also ,and above all, a risk linked to the fundamentals of the market. As a counter-party defaults, financiers will have to ensure that there is a solid market outlet over the duration of the financing period and a sufficient pool of potential off-takers who will be interested in re-contracting with the producer.
Finally, more uncertainty implies more risk but also more profitability. Developer-producers will have to consider less optimized financing structures in their investment decisions and probably commit more equity (it could mean considering later refinancing scenarios and renewing PPAs at higher values) to justify attractive target returns. This could also have the medium-term effect of increasing the profitability of developers and “winning” projects, breathing new life into a sector with historically low returns.

Uzbekistan is currently supporting large scale PV through a series of tenders. A 1 GW tender is being carried out with the support of the ADB. It is part of the 1 GW solar program developed by the government and the lender. Other tenders, for 900 MW of PV capacity, are being held with the support of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) private-sector arm of the World Bank.
According to the latest figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country had 2 GW of installed capacity from hydropower and only 4 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2020.

Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) has revealed that the Spanish startup Greenland intends to set up a 5 GW vertically integrated solar module factory in Spain. The research institute supports this project as an advisor and will oversee everything from factory planning to joint development of advanced cell technologies, including technical support.
“To ensure the necessary international competitiveness in this highly competitive market environment, state-of-the-art production technology will be used, fully connected, in the spirit of Industry 4.0,” the Institute stated.
Engineering company Bosch Rexroth, a subsidiary of the German industrial conglomerate Robert Bosch, is in charge of planning and designing the factory. “Together with Greenland and the Fraunhofer ISE, we are creating in Seville a highly innovative factory of the future, fully flexible and fully connected to the grid, for the promising market for solar cells in Europe,” explained Thomas Fechner, head of the New Business Products Division at Bosch Rexroth.
Greenland wants to rely on state-of-the-art technology. It is planning to manufacture monocrystalline silicon wafers in the M10 format for Passivated Emitter and Rear (PERC) solar cells. These would then be built into multi-busbar interconnected half or triple cell modules with at least 540 W of power.
The factory is expected to be located within a free zone in the port of Seville, in the southern region of Andalusia. “We are very pleased that Greenland has chosen us as a partner for the selection of the start-up technology,” said Jochen Rentsch, department head in the area of photovoltaic production technologies at the Fraunhofer ISE. “We will also accompany Greenland during the start-up and subsequent technological development of the company.”
In 2019, Fraunhofer ISE was commissioned by German engineering association VDMA (Verbandes Deutsches Maschinenbau Anlage) to carry out a study on the competitiveness of the European photovoltaic industry. The study concluded that solar module production in Europe can only be achieved if a factory has a massive scale. Another significant conclusion of the study was that, taking into account that the current manufacturing costs were lower than €0.20 / Wp, the share of costs for the transport of modules as well as for the subcomponents was increasing and approaching 10%. “Therefore, local production close to the destination market and the establishment of a local value chain are essential for the profitability of European photovoltaic production and the independence from imports,” the Fraunhofer ISE experts stated. “With a pricing fair of CO2 emissions, Europe can make good use of its advantages thanks to a significantly lower CO2 footprint of the modules [and] to the combination of European electricity compared to Asian imports.”
Fraunhofer ISE Institute director Andreas Bett sees the project as one more sign that European companies and investors have recognized that the time has come to return to Europe not only technological but also industrial sovereignty in the field of solar energy.
“European research centers are currently developing some of the most advanced technologies in the world, for example tandem solar cells that achieve the highest efficiencies, leading to reduced space and material savings, but also production technologies, sustainable projects that take into account the circular economy and recycling,” he stated. “Supporting investments in these key technologies at the EU level will reinforce European leadership in key strategic technologies.”

Ultium Cells LLC, a joint venture of LG Energy Solution and General Motors, is planning a more than $2.3 billion investment to build a second battery cell manufacturing plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee.
Ultium Cells will build the new plant on land leased from GM. Construction on the 2.8 million-square-foot facility will begin immediately, and the plant is slated to open in late 2023. Once in service, the plant will supply battery cells to a nearby GM assembly plant.
In March, LG Energy Solution said it planned to invest more than $4.5 billion over the next four years to expand its battery production capacity in the U.S. by 70 GWh. The expansion will give the company a total production capacity of more than 110 GWh in the U.S.
GM’s Ultium battery technology uses a large-format, pouch-style cell that can be stacked vertically or horizontally inside the battery pack. This allows engineers to optimize battery energy storage and layout for each vehicle design. Energy options range from 50 to 200 kWh, which could enable a GM-estimated range up to 450 miles or more on a full charge.
GM’s future Ultium-powered EVs are designed for Level 2 and DC fast charging. Most will have 400V battery packs and up to 200 kW fast charging capability; GM’s truck platform will have 800V battery packs and 350 kW fast charging capability.
In late January, GM said that it planned to become carbon neutral in its global products and operations by 2040. The company worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to develop what GM called “a vision of an all-electric future” as well as “an aspiration to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035.”
To reach its goals, GM plans to transition to battery electric vehicles or other zero-emissions vehicle technology, source renewable energy, and leverage “minimal offsets or credits.”
The automaker said at the time that it believes the energy sector is “well on its way to a decarbonized grid” and that an all-electric future will be supported by renewable infrastructure and technology.

After six years of installing solar on the roofs of Western Sydney, Jake Warner made a bold decision. He decided to no longer offer string inverters. Instead, his boutique company, Pentrith Solar, would only install solar systems with the less common and more expensive microinverters.
The switch garnered a number of unforeseen responses. Firstly, the company’s conversion rate – the amount of enquiries which turn to actual sales – increased. “We’re actually getting less price objections,” Warner told pv magazine Australia, “the opposite to what I expected.”
Trouble, it seems, has come from an entirely different source. “The biggest thing I’ve found difficult to handle is, we’re still servicing string inverters,” Warner explained. The issue is that when past customers discover the company has stopped offering string inverters, they’re left feeling lumped with a subpar product. “I didn’t really think about it, but I do have to think about how that makes people feel.”
Warner is quick to clarify that he isn’t trying to wage any wars on string inverters. “This is not about rubbishing string inverters. If that’s what you can afford at the time, that’s fine,” he said. “Coal is the opposition here, not other solar companies and not string inverters.”
Founded in 2017, Penrith Solar averages about six installs every day. The company doesn’t use subcontractors at all and provides customers follow-up support through its in-house service team. Stemming from that commitment, the company recently undertook an internal audit looking at how often its team was called to service solar systems with microinverters compared to those with string inverters. What he found was stark: his team was eight times less likely to be called to fix microinverters than they were string inverters.
“This is just our own study,” Warner qualified. “In our experience, we found [microinverters] to be eight times more reliable.”
Specifically, Penrith Solar has been using Enphase’s IQ range (including the IQ 7, IQ7+ and IQ7 A), and Warner noted that his findings are particular to those products. He found just four failures among the 13,000 microinverters Penrith Solar has installed, according to its internal audit. “We’ve had a tremendously low amount of failures.”
It wasn’t only that Warner has found microinverters to be substantially more reliable, he also thinks they are easier to manage from a warehouse perspective. Instead of having to stock a range of string inverters to fit different system sizes, Warner now just orders one microinverter for every panel coming into his stockroom.
The third factor that swayed Warner was safety. He says his in-house service team gets called out to DC isolator fires weekly. “It sucks, but we’re almost used to it,” Warner said. “It doesn’t even surprise us anymore.” Some clients don’t even realize there has been a fire, according to him, but when his team looks at the isolator, they’ve found it burned. “It’s pretty bad.”
While Penrith Solar has been installing microinverters on solar systems for a number of years, the decision to use them exclusively is relatively new. Which is to say, while the company’s conversion rate has increased in the last two months, it may be more symptomatic of Australians' eagerness to install solar following the pandemic.
Rather than drawing conclusions from the fluctuating rate, Warner is relying on his interactions with customers, who he says have been exceedingly receptive to the microinverters value proposition. Warner has a home-spun theory which he says explains the warm reception, he calls it cost bandwidth.
“When you ask a consumer what they expect to pay for a 6.6 kW system, their response is somewhere from $2,500 to $6,600. They rarely expect to pay more than $1 per watt for a string inverter,” he explained.  “Now when you start talking about microinverters, the client doesn’t expect to get that for $2,500. The client’s mindset starts at about $6,500 and ends somewhere around $10,000 – that’s around where they think is reasonable.”
On the boutique end of the spectrum, a string inverter solar system installed by Penrith Solar used to come in at around $6,900. Its systems fitted with microinverters, on the other hand, start at $7,700. “So with string inverters, [Penrith Solar] are not in that price bandwidth. But with micro-inverters, we’re well and truly within the clients' expectations,” he added.
It’s led the company to have less price objections, with customers overwhelmingly understanding the added value offered microinverter’s ability to monitor both panels and consumption, as well as their longevity. It’s important to note here that solar companies typically charge around 30% more for systems with microinverters, but Penrith Solar has now managed to get this figure down to about 10% through increased installation efficiency. This means that while its microinverter systems are still more expensive than its string inverters were, the price difference is less than half of many of its competitors.
While Warner has found little price pushback, he admits he underestimated the severity of hurt feelings. When we spoke, Warner had just left an inspection for a 90 kW system to be fitted at the business of one of his past residential customers. “The client said to me, ‘how come we’re not using string inverters? We did that on my house, remember?” Warner then had to explain Penrith Solar had stopped offering string inverters, even though he had installed a system on the man’s house with them. “I had to handle his emotions on site, which were – he felt, not betrayed, but wondered if he got the best value for money.”
“I had to explain to him how much the price difference was when he bought his system, and remind him of the saving he’s actually getting right now, as well as informing him that in today’s market, microinverters are the best choice for [his business].”
This delicate juggle between continuing to advocate for the value of string inverters while pitching discontinuing their use has, for Warner, been the hardest part of the transition.
Warner said Penrith Solar is the only company he knows of which has decided to exclusively install microinverters, though he could name a number of other solar companies he believes are using them for a majority of installs.
In terms of other companies operating in Western Sydney and the Blue Mountains, Warner said he has already seen them follow suit and gearing towards microinverter systems. “We’ve done the research for them. We know that it [microinverters] fail less.”
“I’m not saying [microinverters are] always going to be the best choice – there may be in the future something else – 2025, who knows – but right now, with the ammunition and knowledge I have today and the in-field experience, [microinverters] are the best on the market,” Warner said.
