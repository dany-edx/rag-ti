In the week of May 29, solar photovoltaic energy production broke the daily record in the German market with 359 GWh generated on Saturday, June 3.
Compared to the previous week, solar energy production increased in three of the main European markets. The largest increase, of 29%, was registered in Spain, where solar photovoltaic and thermoelectric energy production as a whole is taken into account. In the German and Portuguese markets, the increase in solar generation was 19% and 9.9%, respectively. On the other hand, in the French and Italian markets, production with this technology decreased by 5.9% and 11%, respectively. In the case of Italy, this decrease occurs after the weekly historical record registered during the previous week. For the week of June 5, the solar energy production forecasts of AleaSoft Energy Forecasting indicate that production will increase in Spain but could decrease in Germany and Italy.


In the week of May 29, wind energy production decreased in most of the markets compared to the previous week. The most significant drops were registered in the southern European markets, led by the 70% drop registered in the Spanish market, followed by the 69% drop in Portugal and 58% in Italy. In the German market, the decrease was 9.2%, and in the French market there was an 18% increase in production. For the week starting on June 5, the wind energy production forecasts of AleaSoft Energy Forecasting indicate that increases could be registered in the Iberian Peninsula and Italy, while decreases are expected in the German and French markets.

Electricity demand
The week starting on May 29 ended with a drop in electricity demand in almost all European markets compared to the previous week, except in the Spanish market, where an increase of 0.9% was registered. The largest fall, of 5.4%, was registered in the Italian market, where the Italian Republic Day was celebrated on June 2, followed by decreases of 3.7% in the markets of Great Britain and Belgium, and 3.4% and 3.2% in the German and French markets, respectively. Meanwhile, the Dutch market registered the smallest fall, of 0.4%.
In Germany, Belgium, France, Great Britain, and the Netherlands, the fall in demand was favored by the holiday of May 29, Whit Monday.
Regarding average temperatures, there were increases compared to the previous week in all markets except Great Britain, where a drop of 0.2 C was registered. For the week starting on June 5, a recovery in demand is expected in all the main European markets.

European electricity markets
In the week starting on May 29, the prices of most European electricity markets decreased compared to the previous week. The exceptions were the MIBEL market of Spain and Portugal and the Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries, with increases of 4.4%, 7.1%, and 60%, respectively. The most significant drop in prices, of 17%, was registered in the EPEX SPOT market of Belgium. In the rest of the markets, prices fell between 4.7% in the N2EX market of the United Kingdom and 14% in the EPEX SPOT market of Germany.
In the first week of June, European markets’ weekly average prices remained below €90 ($96.5)/MWh. The highest average price, €87.38/MWh, was that of the Portuguese market, followed by the average of the Spanish market, which was €85.07/MWh. The weekly price of the MIBEL market is the highest among the primary European markets, and this has not taken place since the week of October 31, 2022. Meanwhile, the lowest weekly average was that of the Nordic market, which was €20.86/MWh. In the rest of the markets, prices were between €58.68/MWh in the Dutch market and €83.85/MWh in the IPEX market of Italy.
Regarding hourly prices, negative prices were registered in the Belgian and French markets on May 29, and on June 3 and 4. In the German and Dutch markets, in addition to these days, there were also hours with negative prices on May 31. In the case of the Nordic market, negative hourly prices were reached on May 29 and 31. The lowest hourly price of the first week of June, -€185.86/MWh, was registered on Monday, May 29, from 14:00 to 15:00, in the Dutch market.
During the week starting on May 29, the decrease in the average price of gas and CO2 emission rights, and the fall in demand, led to price decreases in most European electricity markets. In the case of the German market, the increase in solar energy production also contributed to this behavior, and in the case of the French market, the increase in wind energy production. On the other hand, in the Iberian market, where the production with this technology registered a notable decrease, the highest average prices were registered. Price forecasts by AleaSoft Energy Forecasting indicate that, in the second week of June, prices could increase in most European electricity markets, influenced by the increase in demand and the decrease in wind or solar energy production in some cases. But, in the MIBEL market, prices could fall influenced by the increase in wind energy production.

Brent, fuels, and CO2
On Monday, May 29, Brent oil futures for the Front-Month in the ICE market reached their weekly maximum settlement price of $77.07/bbl, which was 1.4% higher than that of the previous Monday. But, subsequently, prices fell until they reached the weekly minimum settlement price of $72.66/bbl on Wednesday, May 31. This price was 7.3% lower than that of the previous Wednesday. During the first two days of June, prices recovered, and the settlement price of Friday, June 2, was $76.13/bbl, only 1.1% lower than that of the previous Friday.
In the first week of June, the negotiations on the US public debt ceiling continued to influence the evolution of Brent oil futures prices. The agreement reached led to the rise in prices on Friday, June 2, to which the May employment data of the United States also contributed.
On the other hand, in the meeting on Sunday, June 4, OPEC+ agreed to maintain the current production cuts until the end of 2024. In addition, Saudi Arabia committed to an additional cut of one million barrels per day starting in July. This could exert an upward influence on prices.
Regarding the TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front-Month, after the decreases of the fourth week of May, during the week of May 29, settlement prices were lower than those of the same days of the previous week. Even so, the week began with an upward trend. Consequently, on Wednesday, May 31, the weekly maximum settlement price of €26.85/MWh was reached, which was only 3.4% lower than that of the previous Wednesday. However, on Thursday, June 1, prices fell by 14% compared to the previous day, and the weekly minimum settlement price of €23.10/MWh was registered. This price was 9.2% lower than that of the previous Thursday and the lowest since May 2021. On Friday, June 2, the settlement price recovered to €23.69/MWh.
In the first week of June, TTF gas futures prices were influenced upward by news of a failure at a liquefied natural gas plant in Norway. However, the high levels of European reserves kept prices below €30/MWh. On the other hand, the plant affected by the failure is expected to return to operation in the second week of June.
Regarding the settlement prices of CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2023, during the first week of June, they were lower than those of the same days of the previous week. On Monday, May 29, the weekly maximum settlement price was reached, €82.86/t, which was 5.6% lower than that of the previous Monday. However, this price was 0.7% higher than that of the last session of the previous week. On the other hand, the weekly minimum settlement price of €78.72/t was registered on Thursday, June 1. This price was 5.1% lower than that of the previous Thursday and the lowest since January of this year.
Lower gas prices support using this fuel for electricity generation instead of coal, which contributes to lower demand for CO2 emission rights in the electricity sector.

Two 50 MW heating systems, powered by nearby wind farms, will use the Wadden Sea as a heat source.
The industrial-scale heat pump will replace coal-fired heat for district heating in Esbjerg. With the district heating and seater systems already commissioned, the solution will go into operation this fall, MAN Energy said on its website. It will provide 25,000 households with heat and produce 350,000 MWh of heat per year.
The heat pump can reach a maximum temperature of 150 C and will deliver water to the city’s district heating network at 90 C.
“One of the unique features of this heat pump solution is that its use of excessive wind power can balance the grid if required,” said Karl Böhle, a senior project manager at MAN.
The ETES heat pump can convert excess wind or solar power into heat, store it, and send it to customers on days with little sun or wind, MAN Energy says in an article on its website.
“The heat pump system can actually change its electrical consumption,” said Kenneth Jørgensen, project director at DIN Forsyning, the utility behind the project. “This we can sell to the grid as a service for integrating further renewable energy. So, we can help grid operators provide better electrical services, and at the same time we deliver clean, cheap heating to our customers.”

The ceiling prices at the upcoming auctions have been set at €105/MWh for wind farms of more than 3 MW in capacity and at €90/MWh for solar projects of more than 500 kW in size. State-owned utility Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS) will act as the sole off-taker on these projects.
The wind quota was initially determined in December 2021, but no tender took place in the meantime. Now, the first wind auction is expected to take place this month, as announced by Energy Minister Dubravka Djedovic in May.
The successful bidders will be subject to the newly adopted balancing responsibility contract model, under which they will be obliged to pay surcharges to EPS for deviations in forecasted output. The amount of the surcharges will be determined according to the prices on the day-ahead market, the government said.
The auctions will be organized with the financial backing of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). In March, the EBRD approved a financing package of €300 million to EPS to accelerate wind and solar rollout and help deliver on the country's ambition to phase out coal by 2050. The bank has been assisting the Serbian authorities with the development of the renewables auctions since 2020.
No date has been set for the solar auction yet. However, the government said it expects “fierce competition” since there are already more than 100 MW of solar plants with generation licenses in the country at this stage.
According to the government data, Serbia currently has 23 operating solar projects. The country’s largest solar plant, the 9.9 MW DeLasol PV project, was switched on in Lapovo, central Serbia, in April.
In May, the Serbian government said it was on a lookout for strategic partner to develop at least five PV plants with a cumulative capacity of 1 GW/1.2 GWh and at least 200 MW/400 MWh of battery energy storage. The facilities are to be built within four to five years, while the contract with the strategic partner, which will be chosen in a tender, will cover a period of six to seven years.
Serbia aims to deploy 8.3 GW of PV by 2024, according to a draft plan released by the government last year. According to the document, utility-scale PV projects could be built on 200,000 hectares of neglected, low-value agricultural land that could host 2 GW of solar.
The draft also outlines the construction of around 300 MW of PV plants, valued at €200 million on land owned by EPS – primarily on its coal ash dumps. Most of the solar capacity envisaged under the 2022-24 draft is supposed to come from rooftop PV.

Noida-based Lohum has launched an off-grid, 5kWh battery energy storage system (BESS) made of second-life electric vehicle (EV) batteries.
The company said its energy storage product meets the essential energy needs of urban and rural India while solving the end-of-life EV battery problem and organizing the battery waste sector. The BESS will provide uninterrupted power supply even in regions with unreliable grid infrastructure.
The battery storage is Lohum’s first product under its partnership with MG Motor to establish a comprehensive ecosystem for used EV batteries’ reuse and life-cycle management.
“Through our expertise in battery material recycling and low-carbon refining, we will play a pivotal role in ensuring the efficient utilization of MG’s EV batteries. By repurposing these batteries as BESS, we contribute to making the clean energy transition circular and address the critical need for reliable power supply in community centers,” stated Lohum. 
The project will harness the potential of used batteries by repurposing them as battery energy storage products (BESS), effectively extending their life cycle and optimizing resource usage.
Lohum’s proprietary repurposing technology will be used to maximize the potential of cells before recycling, utilizing healthy cells high on remaining useful life (RUL) to build sustainable second-life BESS for a wide variety of clean energy applications.

The move aims to reduce water production costs and enhance reliance on solar power in 19 coastal districts facing grid electricity shortages due to lower imports of coal and fuel.
People in coastal belts depend on seawater as ponds and underground water have become salty due to climate change. Cyclones contaminate ponds and canals, rendering water unusable. Rising sea levels have increased salinity in many parts of Bangladesh, including inland areas.
Several solar-powered water desalination units currently operate in southern Bangladesh. Each system includes a 500 W solar power system driving a 0.5 hp (373 W) water pump.In 2020, Australia-based company F Cubed secured a government contract to supply 1,140 desalination machines, providing clean drinking water to around 30,000 people in Bangladesh.
An official at the Department of Public Health Engineering who was involved in the project told the pv magazine that the DPHE ran the pilot project in 16 coastal districts. “From each desalination unit five families can get safe drinking water,” he said.
“This project was financed by the government from its exchequer, but considering the benefits of desalination machines, funds will be sought from development partners to further expand such facility,” he added.
Bangladesh is presently experiencing a 25% low electricity generation in this scorching summer thus at least 3,000 MW of load shedding is occurring every hour.

The company claims that this system can be easily integrated into existing module and cell production lines.
The company said that applying a passivation layer to the edges of various cell formats, including half-cells, multi-cells, and shingle cells, can improve solar cell efficiency by up to 1.0% compared to untreated cells. This improvement is achieved by minimizing unwanted effects at the cut edges.
“The machine can process half cells, multiple cells and also cell strips (shingle cells) after cutting,” stated the company's CEO Stefan Rinck. “Our unique tray design allows processing of thousands of cell parts per tray with high packing density. In the process, the passivation layers are precisely applied to the cut edges without undesirable effects on the cell surfaces.”
Generis PET offers the flexibility of both batch and inline processing and is compatible with any crystalline solar cell technology. The system is currently available for testing and sampling.

“This system has enormous potential for serving low-income households in developing countries, as it requires considerably less input power,” they stated in the paper “A Solar Powered Off-Grid Air Conditioning System with Natural Refrigerant for Residential Buildings: A Theoretical and Experimental Evaluation,” published in Cleaner Energy Systems. “This system offers a more energy-efficient alternative to conventional split units by cooling a canopy at night.”
The system, which the scientists said is designed to utilize low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants, consists of two 400 W solar panels, two 130 Ah lead-acid batteries, and a vapor compression cycle (VCC) unit.
The external unit comprises a compressor, a condenser, an expansion valve, and the two batteries connected in parallel with a charge controller and inverter. The internal unit includes an evaporator, external ducts, and an indoor canopy. “The internal components comprise of the canopy, supply and extract flex ducts and the AC unit,” the research group explained.

The proposed system configuration was assumed to operate in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The scientists said the simulation was performed at different condensation temperatures and showed that the batteries charged by the solar panels are capable of supporting the air conditioning unit during the night.
The system was assumed to run during the summertime, with operating temperatures ranging from 35 C to 40 C and the operating humidity being between 50% to 60%.
The scientists identified the GWP refrigerants R600a and R290 as the best candidates to replace the commonly used R134a and R410A. “Compared to R134a, the experimental coefficient of performance (COP) of R290 improved by 2.42 %, with less input work of 2.31 % and greater exergetic efficiency of 2.37 %,” they explained, noting that the COP shows the maximum value for all candidates as the temperature lift decreases. “Reducing the temperature lift between evaporator and condenser enhances the performance of the system.”
They also found that the unit using R290 requires less than one-third horsepower and that the two batteries were charged enough to operate the system for seven hours. “These results indicate that the unit is practically feasible,” they concluded.

French agrivoltaics specialist GLHD has developed a digital tool for viewing its projects in augmented reality.
Designed for use on tablets by the Bordeaux-based startup Yzar, the application allows its users to display and visualize the fixed structures or trackers of an agrivoltaic farm in a given landscape.
On the basis of this first overview, future residents in the nearby areas will have the possibility of rolling back the panels and simulating the appearance of hedges to become aware of the various landscape integration solutions. They can also move under the structures at the selected anchor point to check the different visual perceptions as they get closer to the project.
“The use of augmented reality is particularly relevant to represent agrivoltaism. The concept of agricultural production in an agrivoltaic system can be complex to understand, as can landscape integration solutions. With this application, the inhabitants of a territory concerned can realize in real time the true size of objects at different distances. This immediacy is important to objectify preconceptions and stimulate everyone's contributions,” said Pierre Jeanne, president and co-founder of Yzar.
Founded in 2017, Yzar develops innovative visualization solutions to help its customers simplify the understanding of their projects by offering precise, animated, and interactive 3D representations, distributed in augmented reality mainly on smartphones or tablets.
“The test that we conducted during a walk allowed participants to understand how trackers work and to visualize the landscape integration that was imagined in consultation with the local communities and authorities,” said Anaïs Plumer, project manager at GLHD.
The company tested the application for the first time on the Précy-le-Sec agrivoltaic project site in Yonne. Created in Martillac near Bordeaux in 2018, GLHD now supports more than 200 active operators involved in the design of agrivoltaic projects.

India's annual utility-scale solar installations are expected to fall by nearly 20% in 2023 due to supply chain challenges, lower auction volumes, and trade policies, according to a new IEA report. It said that India achieved a record-breaking 14 GW of capacity additions in 2022, mainly through auctions. However, auction volumes in 2022 decreased by about one-third, it noted.
Tariffs discovered in 2022 auctions rose by 15% compared to 2021, deterring financially struggling distribution companies (DISCOMs) from entering contracts. Some states that met their Renewable Purchase Obligations avoided additional auctions, while hybrid tenders gained government agency attention.
The IEA anticipates that the reduced awarded capacity in 2022 will result in a slowdown in PV capacity addition in 2023. In addition, short-term supply-demand imbalances and higher prices, caused by import tariffs, will impact PV expansion in 2023 and 2024, according to the IEA.
Developers prioritize high-output top-tier modules for cost efficiency and easier access to low-cost financing, according to the IEA. However, the demand for these modules exceeds supply in the short term, as large producers offering modules with over 500 W of power declared less than 5 GW of their total manufacturing capacity.
Import tariffs imposed on PV modules and cells in April 2022 resulted in a 30-40% price increase in the second half of the year, impacting project bankability. Consequently, developers had to postpone or cancel projects until PV prices decreased. The government responded by postponing ALMM requirements and extending commissioning deadlines for projects commissioned by April 2024.
While government actions have addressed some challenges, the temporary supply-demand mismatch for top-tier PV modules will hinder rapid utility-scale PV expansion in 2023 and 2024. However, the IEA foresees a booming PV deployment in India beyond 2025, driven by higher auction volumes and lower prices.
The report anticipates India to achieve full self-sufficiency in solar PV supply within the next four to five years as manufacturing capacity awarded in the production-linked subsidy scheme becomes operational.
In conclusion, the IEA expects India's renewable capacity additions to rebound in 2023 and 2024, driven by faster onshore wind, hydropower, and distributed solar PV deployment.

Brisbane-based startup Endua has unveiled its first hydrogen battery in the Brisbane suburb of Archerfield, near its headquarters, as a testing platform. Endua’s hydrogen power bank uses electrolysis technology developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and is capable of powering 100 kW per unit.
The Archerfield hydrogen battery provides enough power to drive a water pump, farm shed or standalone telecom infrastructure, Endua said. The solution is designed to replace diesel generators in off-grid and remote locations, with the company listing farms, telecoms infrastructure, and microgrid communities as potential users.
Endua’s hydrogen battery works by using renewable energy to power the small-scale, CSIRO-developed polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. The hydrogen is then stored as a compressed gas, and can be converted back to electricity on demand via the internal fuel cell.
“Our power banks mean we can decouple standalone and microgrid power systems from fossil fuel-generated diesel and provide a cheaper long-term solution than batteries,” said Endua CEO Paul Sernia.
The company said the hydrogen battery is highly configurable and can be scaled according to on-site demand due to its modular design.
Australia, especially Western Australia, has been rapidly deploying solar-driven standalone power stations and microgrids, as these technologies offer significant cost savings compared to maintaining poles and wires or diesel generators. However, these solutions almost always include a small diesel backup generator.
In May, the company said that it had raised more than AUD 11.8 million to scale up its hydrogen battery solution. Investors in the raise included the Queensland Investment Corp., Melt Ventures, Ampol, and the CSIRO.
Endua is currently in the process of commercializing the newly unveiled 100 kW power bank.

Space-based solar power has been studied for decades because, theoretically, it could tap into a virtually unlimited supply of solar energy in outer space. California Institute of Technology (Caltech) researchers estimate that solar from space could yield eight times more power than solar panels at any location on Earth’s surface, and in January, the Caltech Space Solar Power Project (SSPD) launched a prototype into orbit to beam power to Earth.
The SSPD deployed a constellation of modular spacecraft equipped with PV to collect sunlight, convert it to electricity, and then wirelessly transmit the electricity over long distances wherever it is needed. Caltech said the technology could be useful to remote areas that do not have supportive transmission infrastructure.
Wireless power transfer was demonstrated by Microwave Array for Power-transfer Low-orbit Experiment (MAPLE), developed at Caltech. It is one of three key technologies being tested by the Space Solar Power Demonstrator (SSPD-1), the first space-borne prototype from Caltech’s SSPP.
MAPLE includes lightweight microwave power transmitters driven by custom electronic chips that were built using low-cost silicon technologies. It uses the array of transmitters to beam the energy to desired locations.
“Through the experiments we have run so far, we received confirmation that MAPLE can transmit power successfully to receivers in space,” said Ali Hajimiri, professor of electrical engineering and medical engineering and co-director of SSPP.

In the June issue of pv magazine, due out on Friday, we turn the spotlight onto European solar with a comprehensive review of the state of the PV industry across the region’s key markets and a look at the legislation which aims to drive a solar rooftop boom. We also examine the difficulty of establishing a solar panel recycling industry in Australia, where industry backbiting isn’t helping matters.
“We have also been able to program the array to direct its energy toward Earth, which we detected here at Caltech,” said Hajimiri. “We had, of course, tested it on Earth, but now we know that it can survive the trip to space and operate there.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/06/perovskite-solar-cell-based-on-mortise-tenon-tech-achieves-24-55-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 6, 2023",Perovskite solar cell based on Mortise-Tenon tech achieves 24.55% efficiency,"Researchers at Nanjing Tech University in China have designed a perovskite solar cell that uses a Mortise-Tenon (M-T) structure to create a large-contact area between the perovskite absorber and the hole transport layer (HTL). They claim that this contributes to enhancing cell performance and durability.
M-T structures are commonly used in woodworking for strong connections between different materials, providing resistance to twisting. In the proposed configuration, the M-T structure consists of the perovskite absorber and a thermally polymerized additive called N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (NVP) used for the hole transport layer (HTL).
According to the scientists, NVP maintains a strong interaction with perovskite precursors during the spin-coating process, resulting in improved charge transport and high-quality perovskite/NVP films.
The cell design includes a glass/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, SnO2-based HTM, perovskite absorber with NVP, spiro-OMeTAD layer, and a gold (Au) metal contact.
Comparing the device performance to a reference cell, the champion device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.55%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.187 V, a short-circuit current density of 25.66 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 80.64%. The researchers emphasized the benefits of suppressed non-radiative recombination and balanced interface charge extraction due to high-quality perovskite crystals and the Mortise-Tenon structure.
In contrast, the reference device achieved an efficiency of 22.91%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.151 V, a short-circuit current density of 25.21 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 78.94%.
Additionally, the cell with the M-T structure demonstrated excellent durability, retaining over 95% of its initial efficiency for 1100 hours. The device underwent measurement and certification at the Quality Testing Center for Photovoltaic and Wind Power Systems of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
They presented the cell technology in “Monolithically-grained perovskite solar cell with Mortise-Tenon structure for charge extraction balance,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.
“Our work highlights the role of increasing the contact area of perovskite layer and HTL and proposes a unique strategy to realize interfacial charge-extracting balance in perovskite solar cells, which may be an important approach to achieve efficient device in the future,” they concluded.
