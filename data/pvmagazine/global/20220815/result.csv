The ClipperCreek EV chargers include hardwired or plug-in options with flexible power configurations that work with any EV currently sold in North America.
Siemens and Mahle have agreed to jointly standardize wireless EV charging by developing and testing complete infrastructure and automotive engineering systems. They said they aim to close gaps to ensure full interoperability between vehicles and charging infrastructure, in addition to developing a complete inductive charging system for EVs. “Wireless charging of electric vehicles is emerging as a major market for the future,” said Stefan Perras, head of predevelopment and innovation for charging infrastructure at Siemens, which recently acquired a minority stake in wireless charging specialist WiTricity for $25 million. “The transfer efficiency of wireless, inductive charging is comparable to plug-in systems.”
Tesla has revealed that its Gigafactory Shanghai has produced its 1 millionth EV, in an important milestone for the company’s main export hub. After starting production in December 2019, Gigafactory Shanghai quickly became the biggest EV factory in the world. It ended 2021 with an annual production volume of more than 800,000 vehicles. Gigafactory Shanghai only produces Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, but it is expected to expand to more models next year, with plans to increase its production capacity to 20 million cars per year by the end of the decade.
Mercedes-Benz has expanded its battery supply partnership with Chinese battery maker CATL on its way to going fully electric. CATL announced plans last week to invest €7.34 billion ($7.6 billion) in the construction of a 100 GWh battery plant in Debrecen, Hungary. It will be the company’s second battery cell manufacturing facility in Europe and the biggest greenfield investment in the country's history. In a separate announcement, Mercedes-Benz said it will be the first partner to receive battery cells from the Hungarian plant, with the largest initial order volume.
Jet Charge has won contracts from the Western Australian government to install EV chargers along what could be the world’s longest electric highway. The Melbourne-based EV fast-charging specialist will install 98 EV chargers at 49 locations in the state. Once completed, the infrastructure will serve to create the world’s longest continuously connected electric highway. Each charging location will be fitted with a standard charger and a 150 kW DC fast charger capable of fully charging a car in as little as 15 minutes. The first charging stations will be installed in November, with the full network set to be operational by 2024.
Freyr has announced the establishment of a technology resources campus and business unit in Japan. The new business unit is the Norwegian battery company's first physical location in Asia and will focus on scaling up testing and development of its battery platform, in cooperation with 24M Technologies. Freyr’s new facility will be located in Fukuoka prefecture, where the testing equipment is now being installed, the company said. A few weeks ago, Freyr's board also approved plans for a battery cell factory in Rana, Norway. Production is scheduled to start in the first half of 2024, with a targeted annual capacity of 29 GWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/15/new-platform-centralizes-ppa-market-data/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,NORTH AMERICA",BLAKE MATICH,"AUGUST 15, 2022",New platform centralizes PPA market data,"Recent years have seen enormous demand for renewables to enter the grid and for power purchase agreements (PPAs) to make use of them. However, on top of the already tricky state of supply chains, geopolitical unrest and grid congestion heightening the risk of curtailment along with “revenue cannibalization,” the PPA market has proven increasingly volatile. 
According to Zurich-based consultancy Pexapark, approximately 400 MW of PPAs were closed in Europe in March 2022, representing a sharp contraction in the market from February, when 1.3 GW of PPAs were contracted. The war in Ukraine is having repercussions on PPA prices and Europe could see very complicated electricity price curves in the remainder of the year, the analyst explained.
Prasun Chaudhury, director of data solutions at LevelTen Energy, told pv magazine that “instant access to fresh data is even more critical in today's volatile energy market, which has been changing rapidly over the past two years.” Chaudhury noted rises in renewable PPA price offers of 30% in North America and 47% in Europe. 

That access PPA price data has long been a challenge.
“Price offers are only shared directly between buyers and sellers,” another LevelTen spokesperson said. “And often as a product of weeks-long FRP processes that can result in outdated prices by the time they are completed. Without access to data from a centralized marketplace, clean energy buyers, sellers, investors and analysts struggled to get the data they needed for benchmarking, modeling and analysis.” 
A cursory look at some of the platform's features shows data on everything from price offers, capacity sizes, projected settlement values and status updates across North America and Europe. The data can also be examined for particular contract details, such as operation dates, contract tenor, shape, escalator, non-settlement thresholds, and market price floors.
The data itself is taken from the LevelTen's online PPA marketplace, in which the company boasts 90% of renewable energy developers in North America and more than 60% of developers in Europe take part. As an example of the kind of PPA deals the market is currently seeing, Chaudhury points to a deal between Constellation and US media and technology giant Comcast. The 250 MW deal represents a 15-year PPA with Scout Clean Energy's Blue Sky solar project in northern Illinois.
The market may be in a volatile phase, and solar PPA prices may have risen for the past two years, but the demand for solar PPAs remains strong.  In the last six months, LevelTen's Energy Marketplace has seen organizations seek to procure clean energy PPAs for around 6 TWh, a figure which rises to 75 TWh over the life of the PPAs. 
As developers hustle to catch up with demand, Chaudhury says the MarketPulse platform can deliver “greater transparency” to the PPA market while empowering “energy sellers to price their PPAs more effectively, buyers to quickly compare and benchmark price offers, and investors to conduct thorough due diligence and inform financial models.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/15/uk-steelmakers-could-be-spared-from-clean-energy-costs/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UNITED KINGDOM",MAX HALL,"AUGUST 15, 2022",UK steelmakers could be spared from clean energy costs,"The UK government is considering exempting energy-intensive industry from having to contribute toward the costs of the nation's renewables subsidy schemes.
Businesses such as steelmakers, paper mills, glass, ceramics, and cement companies are already exempt from up to 85% of the costs passed onto all commercial entities to fund national programs such as the contracts-for-difference and Renewables Obligation schemes, which incentivize clean power generation. The Energy Intensive Industries Exemption Scheme, which provides those reductions, was extended for three years in April. It had its budget doubled and now the government's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is discussing whether such companies should be exempt entirely from the “green levy.”
The consultation exercise opened last week and will close on Sept. 16.
BEIS said the green levy applied to electricity generators has helped to make UK electricity prices more expensive than power generated in Europe. The higher cost could drive businesses away from the United Kingdom, deter companies such as steelmakers from electrifying fossil fuel-driven operations, and see consumers instead buy higher-carbon intensive products from parts of the world with more lax climate change policies, according to BEIS.
With the UK's next prime minister due to be announced on Sept. 5, favorite Liz Truss told The Spectator magazine in July she would introduce a “temporary moratorium on the green energy levy to enable businesses and industry to thrive while looking at the best way of delivering net zero,” rendering the current consultation moot. Rival Rishi Sunak has promised to demerge energy from BEIS into a standalone government department again.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/15/monitoring-degradation-for-13-module-types/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,QUALITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 15, 2022",Monitoring degradation for 13 module types,"Any change to the contents of a PV module – whether moving to an entirely new cell technology, or simply changing the thickness of the glass in front of the cells– can affect its performance in the field and its susceptibility to different mechanisms that reduce performance over time.
Scientists led by Sandia National Laboratories in the United States investigated how frequent changes in module technology affect their long-term performance. The group purchased 834 PV modules from the open market between 2016 and 2018, and has since been carefully monitoring their performance installed at locations with varying climate conditions – New Mexico, Colorado and Florida.
Modules were selected from seven different manufacturers, covering 13 different module types. Based on the number of manufacturers included in the study, the selection represented 55% of the US module market in 2020, based on market figures from Wood Mackenzie.
Modules were flash-tested upon arrival at their installations (testing conducted by Sandia in New Mexico, the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, and the University of Central Florida. A sample of the installed modules was then tested annually and compared against control modules stored in a climate controlled dark room for the same time period.
The full testing procedure, along with the results, is described in “Onymous early-life performance degradation analysis of recent photovoltaic module technologies,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The study found that module degradation rates tend to stabilize after three to four years, and that additional flash-testing after this period could help system owners better ensure that modules are performing according to financial expectations.
They also noted significant differences between different bill of materials, even in modules from the same manufacturer. And the modules installed in the hot and humid subtropical climate in Florida saw a significantly degradation rate – though the study notes that a larger sample would be needed to verify this as a trend.
The degradation rate of 26.1% of modules installed exceeded the limits specified in the warranty, while 56.5% of those studied would continue to perform at better than 80% of their initial rating beyond 30 years in the field, assuming their degradation continues at the same rate.
“Although the costs declined sharply in the last decade, module degradation rates do not seem to be affected, at least for the sample investigated in this work,” the paper concludes. “This is a very encouraging result, but more opportunities exist to reduce Rd to levels that enable longer PV module lifetimes.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/15/whats-in-the-inflation-reduction-act-for-the-solar-industry/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 15, 2022",What’s in the Inflation Reduction Act for the solar industry?,"From pv magazine USA
This past Sunday, the United States Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act, and today the House of Representatives votes on the bill. It is now on its way to the President’s desk for a final signature as soon as next week.
The bill – known technically as H.R. 5376 – Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 – is 730 pages of dense legalese. The document covers a wide variety of topics including healthcare, corporate taxes, staffing at the IRS, and – of course – energy related legislation.
With that, we at pv magazine USA will try our best to extract and point to the pieces of the legislation that will directly affect our industry.
The Investment Tax Credit has been increased from 26% to 30%, and may now be transferred or sold to other taxpayers. The 30% applies to both business and residential projects, including projects installed in 2022, and will last until the end of 2032.
Everyone should learn how to utilize a transferable credit. While transferable credits are not as simple as cash from the government via Direct Pay, they are not nearly as complex as tax equity structures.
Energy storage projects were previously ineligible for tax credits unless they were connected directly to solar power projects. The Inflation Reduction Act removes these requirements, and allows energy storage projects to receive the same 30% tax credit, even if they are stand-alone facilities. Batteries connected to a solar power project will continue to qualify for the credit, even if they are no longer being charged by solar power.
Interconnection costs will also be included in the tax credit, for projects smaller than 5 MWac.
The business tax credit can be found starting on page 263, while the residential tax credit update can be found starting on page 351.
Starting in 2025, the Investment Tax Credit will be retired and turned into a much broader, technology agnostic credit, that applies not only to solar power, but to many emission reducing techniques. The same terms apply for solar, which also gets a 30% transferable tax credit that lasts until September 30, 2031. After 2032, the credit will begin to decrease. This technology agnostic tax credit can be found starting on page 464.
For larger projects, there are additional considerations:
For projects of more than 1 MWac and above must pay attention to employment requirements. By default, the tax credit is 6%. To be eligible for the additional 24%, laborers and mechanics installing the solar power projects must be paid prevailing wages, and must be part of an electrical apprenticeship program. These tax credits will begin to apply to projects in 2023.
Additionally, there are requirements for the ratio of apprentices to journeyworkers, which are specified by the Department of Labor or the applicable State apprenticeship agency. Contractors or subcontractors who employ more than 4 individuals performing construction, alteration, or repair work must employ at least one qualified apprentice to perform such work.
Violations will result in fines to the Secretary of Labor of $5,000 for each laborer or mechanic who is underpaid. If the underpayment is found to be intentional, the fine doubles to $10,000 per laborer or mechanic. These details can be found starting on page 234.
Solar power projects eligible for the full 30% tax credit can increase their tax credit by an additional 10% – to 40% in total – by purchasing domestically produced hardware. Per the document, 100% of steel and iron must be US manufactured in the United States. For manufactured goods – like solar panels, inverters, and electrical gear – the goods must initially be 40% US manufactured, though this percentage will increase in the future.
Historically, for goods to be classified as Made in the USA, they must be composed of at least 55% domestic content. The bill lists some exceptions to these requirements. Items that are not of satisfactory quality, or are not produced in sufficient quantities, may be imported. Items that would increase the project cost by greater than 25% may be sourced outside the US as well. These requirements, and exceptions, will apply to all project sizes.
This report from the Congressional Research Service offers more refined answers.
Projects that are located in former ‘energy communities’ can earn an additional 10% tax credit. Energy communities are first defined as brownfields, and secondly as locations associated with fossil fuels over the last generation.
If there have been significant extraction jobs associated with coal, oil, or natural gas after December 31,1999, then the census tract – and its connecting census tracts – are eligible. If a coal power plant or mine has closed in the same window, the area and its surrounding tracts are also eligible. Language describing energy communities can be found starting on page 250.
For a long time, the wind industry has been given a tax credit on a per kilowatt-hour basis. Prior to 2007, the solar industry was also eligible for this production credit. The Production Tax Credit is now fully applicable to the solar power industry. In this document, it is titled the ‘Clean Electricity Production Credit’.
If a solar power project meets the prevailing wage requirements, then it will receive a tax credit of 2.5 cents/kWh for the first ten years of a project’s life. If a project does not meet prevailing wage standards, it will earn only 0.3 cents/kWh before adjustment for inflation. Going forward, the production credit increases as it is adjusted for inflation. Language describing the production credit can be found starting on page 442.
The Ossoff Manufacturing Credits made it into the bill – and then some. There are tax credits for manufacturing the various solar panel, inverter, and racking components, as well.
For solar modules the credits are expected to include:
For inverters the credit would be applied per watt of alternating current:
Torque tubes for racking will receive 87 cents per kilogram, while structural fasteners get $2.28 per kilogram. Language describing the production credit can be found starting on page 414.
There is also a 10% adder for solar power projects that sell their electricity via community solar projects to low-income individuals. If we add the 30% tax credit base, 10% for domestic content, 10% for being located in a former fossil fuel energy community, and 10% for selling the electricity via community solar to low income families – the tax credit could potentially reach 60%.
There are additional tax credits for EVs, electrical panels, heat pumps, and many other items directly related to our industry that pv magazine USA will cover in the future.
Not all of the details of the legislation are fully developed, as there are rules that the IRS and Treasury Department will need to develop, publicize, and provide guidance on for more specific detailed tax related questions. This article is not intended to provide legal or financial advice, so please seek out professional opinions before developing any solar power or energy storage facilities.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/15/alencon-systems-releases-new-centralized-dcdc-converter/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",BRIAN PUBLICOVER,"AUGUST 15, 2022",Alencon Systems releases new centralized DC:DC converter,"From pv magazine USA
Alencon Systems has announced the launch of CUBE, a new DC:DC converter that is designed for high-voltage applications, with support for 1,000 V and 1,500 V. The converter is rated from 430 kW and up, and can be configured for solar and energy storage applications.
The CUBE (Combined Universal Buck/Boost Power Electronics) comes in a compact design, with high levels of power density. Alencon said the power density of the CUBE is about five times greater than other non-isolated DC:DC converters in a similar power class.
The power density is achieved via a silicon carbide-based power train, which is currently patent pending in the United States. Like all Alencon products, the CUBE is designed and manufactured in the company’s factory in Philadelphia.
In large-scale solar facilities, the CUBE provides distributed energy harvesting to increase energy yield for projects using larger central inverters. The converter will step up voltage to a central inverter, thereby allowing the inverter to operate at greater utilization. This enables large-scale PV plants to be built with fewer power blocks, lowering costs. The CUBE allows for less copper to be used in the balance of the system by operating at higher voltage and lower current.
The converter also allows PV facilities to be “storage ready” and can be useful in repowering older PV arrays. In energy storage applications, the CUBE can be used to step up voltage from lower voltage batteries to higher voltage power conversion systems. As a result of its high switching frequency, the CUBE provides minimal additional fault current contribution to a battery energy storage system.
“The introduction of the CUBE series of DC:DC converters allows Alencon to offer alternative energy project developers yet another unique tool in an increasingly DC coupled world,” said Hanan Fishman, president of Alencon Systems. “Alencon has leveraged its decade of expertise in building high power, high voltage DC:DC converters with next generation silicon carbide power electronics to deliver a product of unrivaled power density to the market. The addition of the CUBE to Alencon’s product line-up is consistent with our mission to become the premier supplier of high power, high voltage DC:DC optimizers to the alternative energy industry.”
The CUBE joins Alencon’s existing line-up of galvanically isolated, modular DC:DC optimizers, the SPOT and BOSS. The CUBE can be paired with the Alencon BOSS, to create cost-effective, fixed-voltage DC bus solar-plus-storage projects.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/15/universal-method-to-improve-lifespan-of-lithium-ion-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SOUTH KOREA",MARIJA MAISCH,"AUGUST 15, 2022",Universal method to improve lifespan of lithium-ion batteries,"Charge and discharge cycles in lithium-ion batteries cause anode volumes to change, reducing battery capacity and cycle life. Now, researchers at GIST in South Korea have developed a new way to strengthen the anode and modify it, regardless of its material or how it is manufactured.
Over time, charging and discharging causes the nanoparticles in the anode to crack and cluster together at the electrode-electrolyte interface. This leads to an electrical disconnection, reducing the amount of charge the anode can store or transport. To address this issue, GIST researchers have developed a method to make the anode more resilient against volume changes by encapsulating the nanoparticles in an elastic web-like structure.
The researchers described in Journal of Materials Chemistry A how they used a conventional anode containing silicon nanoparticles held together by a polymer (polyvinylidene fluoride) binder. To accommodate the web-like structure, they removed the binder by heating the anode using an annealing process.
The gap between the nanoparticles was then filled in with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) solution, which dried up to form a web that held the silicon nanoparticles together and prevented them from cracking. Additionally, the web provided a conductive pathway for the electrons, allowing the nanoparticles to bind with lithium.
The researchers used a technique called “spin coating” to coat the anode surface with rGO. The rGO coating served as a seed layer for the deposition of a protective layer consisting of zinc oxide with magnesium and gallium metal oxides added to it (MGZO). This MGZO layer provided structural stability to the anode.
“The structure retained a high storage capacity of 1566 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles and showed 91% coulombic efficiency, which relates to the battery life. This could pave the way for electric vehicles that enable us to drive long distances on one-time charging,” said Prof. Hyeong-Jin Kim, who joined GIST after serving as president of LG Chem Michigan.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/15/sol-systems-develops-bifacial-solar-project-with-pollinator-habitat/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NEW YORK,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 15, 2022",Sol Systems develops bifacial solar project with pollinator habitat,"From pv magazine USA
The Monroe County Water Authority (MCWA) project spans 29 acres and is one of the first in New York state to use bifacial solar modules and single axis tracking. For added sustainability, the site was planted with a seed mixture of pollinator plants, which will create new habitats for local pollinators, boosting the surrounding ecosystem.
The array, which is part of the MCWA’s long-term goal to reduce energy expenses, is expected to generate 8 GW hours of electricity per year. This represents more than 15% of its energy needs for water pumping and treatment.
“Reliably providing quality, affordable water is our top priority. MCWA should realize substantial savings over the course of this 25-year contract, helping keep water rates affordable,” said Nick Noce, MCWA executive director. “Beyond the financial benefits of the solar array, utilizing sustainable, clean energy is a significant step forward in our commitment to environmental stewardship.”
Sol Systems was selected through a competitive bidding process led by NYPA to install and operate the solar array at no expense to the water authority. In return, the kilowatt-hours of energy produced by the panels are delivered to Rochester Gas & Electric and a percentage is credited to MCWA on its energy bills. The project also qualified for the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) solar energy incentive, which will pay nearly $1 million toward the project over the first two years of operation.
“The New York Power Authority is pleased to have played an energy advisor role for the Water Authority to help make this unique solar project happen in Monroe County,” said Justin E. Driscoll, NYPA’s interim president and CEO. “This prudent use of Water Authority land will make a new source of clean power available to the Water Authority. Monroe County residents and New Yorkers as a whole will benefit from further reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which supports the state’s ambitious clean energy goals. We commend the Water Authority’s dedication to this clean energy project, even amidst the challenges that we faced together during the pandemic and over the last few years.”
The Water Authority’s new system will generate electricity to help support New York’s clean energy goals of achieving 70% renewables-sourced electricity by 2030 and a 100% carbon-free electricity sector by 2040. The state plans to build at least 10 GW of distributed solar by 2030, enough to annually power nearly 700,000 homes.
“The economic and sustainable benefits of this project will be felt for years to come, and we are proud to have had such committed partners in MCWA and NYPA,” said Anna Toenjes, Sol Systems’ senior director. “In addition to providing clean energy and cost savings, the project’s pollinator habitat will provide decades of positive impact to the local ecosystem.”
