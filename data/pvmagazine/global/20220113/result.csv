Seattle-based renewables transaction infrastructure provider LevelTen Energy said the overall price index for European solar and wind PPA price offers rose 7.8%, from Q3 to Q4, with the cheapest 25% of deals reaching €52.46/MWh to mark a €3.78 quarterly rise.
The index series, compiled by LevelTen, analyses the thousands of solar and wind PPA pricing offers listed on the company’s Energy Marketplace across 21 countries in Europe and North America. In 2020, the company became the first to provide a global liquid PPA marketplace, that allows corporates to view and compare the risk and value of each PPA available in Europe and North America.

Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights.

According to the U.S. company's Q4 2021 PPA Price Index, upward price pressure trends continued for a third consecutive quarter at the end of last year, totaling 17.4% over the nine months since March. Multiple reasons behind reduced PPA supply and rising prices include macroeconomic and regulatory challenges, including the energy crisis; as well as supply chain constraints; inflation; rising commodity costs; and a rising number of government renewables auctions, according to LevelTen. Consequently, Europe’s P25 Index – an aggregation of the lowest 25% of solar and wind PPA offers – now stands at €52.46/MWh.
While selling energy into wholesale electricity markets carries a degree of merchant risk, the current, sky-high wholesale prices are making that route an increasingly attractive option for solar and wind developers. “With wholesale prices being as high as they are, developers are raising their PPA prices to make up the revenue they could have otherwise made selling a greater percentage of their electricity on the day-ahead market,” said Fred Carita, LevelTen manager of developer services for Europe.
The crisis has reverberated across Europe to different degrees. Previously stable throughout most of last year, LevelTen's Italian P25 solar prices surged almost 21% in the last three months of the year. The country introduced regulatory changes in 2021 to simplify permitting and accelerate project development timelines but that has still not had any effect on PPA prices, with projects with a clear line of sight to commercial operation increasingly desirable to energy off-takers.
Meanwhile, Spain experienced a short-term cool off with its fourth-quarter P25 solar prices rising 11.5% to €34/MWh as clean power developers adopted “wait-and-see” tactics. Consequently, the country’s percentage of total European offers on the LevelTen marketplace fell 12% from the previous quarter. That was due to the implementation of profit capping regulations in September, which reduced revenue from non‑carbon emitting plants and established excess remuneration would be determined on a monthly basis from the average price of Iberian gas. Private PPA prices have also been affected by plans for a 500MW government auction slated for April 6, which will allocate 200MW of concentrating solar generation capacity and 140MW of distributed solar, among other technologies.
An abundance of low-cost hydro insulated Nordic nations against upward price pressures but not uniformly. Power imported from Denmark left Sweden vulnerable to the impact of German wholesale electricity and PPA prices. Southern Sweden in particular is more exposed to central European market trends and the area saw rising PPA prices, with the nation's P25 wind tariffs going up 24% in the fourth quarter, to hit €36.48/MWh.
Despite such headwinds, however, there was a 69% increase in annual PPA-contracted renewables capacity in Europe between 2020 and last year, according to industry group data, with non-standard contract structures such as upside sharing above a set price ceiling; delayed contract starts; and market-indexed PPAs rising in popularity.
“The good news is that PPA deals are still getting done,” said Rob Collier, VP of developer solutions at LevelTen. “Contract innovations tailored to current market conditions are enabling successful PPA transactions. And … buyers have so far remained undeterred by market conditions, meaning that demand is still high. Both of these facts are encouraging because it means that parties on both sides of the table are incentivized to find common ground.”

India had installed a cumulative 49.3GW of solar generation capacity by the end of last year.
Excluding large hydro, the nation's total clean power capacity stood at 104.87GW on December 31, including 40GW of wind; 10.2GW of biomass; 4.8GW of small hydro projects, with generation capacities of up to, and including 25MW; and 400MW of waste-to-energy incinerators.
With India's 46.5GW of large hydro plants included, the nation’s renewable energy capacity was 151.4GW, according to state body the Central Electricity Authority.
With the figures including only off-grid installations added since July, however, the real volume of India's clean power facilities is even higher.
The nation has been assessed by state body the National Institute of Solar Energy as having around 750GWp of solar capacity potential, based on land availability and solar irradiation, and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is attempting to resolve land and grid connection and capacity obstacles as India targets 500GW of non fossil fuel generation capacity this decade.

“The Solar Ink can be used to create standalone perovskite solar modules or it can be combined with existing solar modules in a tandem configuration,” the company's marketing coordinator, Vanness Chan, told pv magazine. “It can be applied by various coating and printing technologies such as spin-coating, blade-coating, slot-die coating, or inkjet printing.”
According to the manufacturer, the ink can be coated on both flexible and rigid substrates, resulting in translucent solar cells which, in turn, can be used to produce flexible and light modules for application in solar windows and vehicle-integrated photovoltaics where silicon, due to its rigidity and heaviness, cannot be used.

The ink is being produced in British Columbia, Canada's westernmost province, where the company is headquartered. “We can produce up to 100ml per batch in-house and we have identified a third party vendor who can scale to 20l per day,” Chan added. “It can be used with already existing equipment in the solar industry for scalable module production.”
The ink consists of a yellow liquid with a solid content of around 46% and a shelf life of 120 days. “Perovskite solar inks are very sensitive to humidity but our ink can be stored and used in ambient conditions,” Chan further explained. “It also can be coated at low temperatures, allowing for the fabrication of flexible solar cells.”
Solaires Entreprises is currently selling the product to academic and research institutions as well as to, unspecified industrial entities. According to the company, the ink can be also used for light-emitting diode (LED) applications with strong emission in the near-infrared region.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/13/modeling-method-for-agrivoltaics-in-greenhouses/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 13, 2022",Modeling method for agrivoltaics in greenhouses,"Researchers at the University of Jaén in Spain have looked at the potential of agrivoltaics for greenhouses in areas with high crop cultivation in greenhouses. They have developed a dual model that they claim enables a proper project design, in order to ensure solid electricity production and high crop yields.
“Our model is applicable to all kinds of greenhouses,” researcher Eduardo F. Fernández told pv magazine. “We could just tune the tilt angle of the module and the surface to specially evaluate the greenhouse.”
The researchers considered semi-transparent crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar modules in the modeling.
“These panels, however, introduce non-uniformities that affect crops growing,” Fernández added. “To sort out this issue, novel transparent thin-film technologies are also being investigated, such as amorphous silicon (a-Si), cadmium telluride ( CdTe), perovskite and dye-sensitized panels. Also, organic transparent PV is a promising technology since its spectral transmittance can be easily tuned to be adapted to the specific spectral absorption band of crops.”
He claimed that thin-film and organic PV panels are flexible and lightweight and will be easier to integrate than c-Si-based products.
“Finally, solar concentration technology is also being investigated for its ability for achieving superior efficiencies and improving the light quality that falls on the plants due to the use of optical elements,” he said. “In this sense, different optical configurations are being investigated to focus the light on small c-Si or multi-junction solar, while the diffuse light is transmitted to the crops.”
The researchers said in “Global energy assessment of the potential of photovoltaics for greenhouse farming” – which was recently published in Applied Energy – that the new modeling considers two main outputs: the energy generated by the PV system and the crop photosynthetic rate over a specific period of time as a function of PV system transparency. It is also based on three sub-models that consider the broadband and spectral content of the irradiance, the solar cell technology and its performance metrics, and the relationship between the photosynthetic rate and the effective photon flux that falls on the crops.
“This way, the model is general and can be adapted to any crop, location and, to the main semi-transparent PV technologies,” they said.
They considered five main families of crops in the study – Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae, Solanacae, Poaceae, and Rosaceae – for the following locations: El Ejido (Spain), Pachino (Italy), Antalya (Turkey), and Vicente Guerrero (Mexico).
“We have only considered locations with arid or semi-arid and temperate climate,” they said. “The conclusions of this work are representative of locations with a high penetration of greenhouses and with favourable conditions for the implementation of PV technology.”
The researchers found that the optimum PV system for greenhouses is an array that reduces the annual net photosynthesis rate by up to 10% and has only a marginal impact on crop yield. The system should also have a spectral total transmittance factor (TRF) of 0.68.
“The lower the photon flux at which the crops reach their maximum photosynthetic rate the lower the TRF, and therefore, the larger the PV capacity,” the scientists said. “In addition, we have also found that the higher the solar resource the lower the TRF.”
For the four locations they considered, the academics also found that the PV systems could generate around 135 kWh/m2. The total energy yield is significantly affected by the type of crop selected, they noted.
“To contextualize these results, it is noticeable to mention that the average energy yield produced by APV systems would represent a contribution to the total energy market between 2.3% (México) and 6.0% (Turkey),” they concluded.

The 162MW (AC) Columboola Solar Farm has been successfully connected to the transmission network in the Western Downs region of Queensland, Australia, according to Powerlink Queensland. 
The Columboola Solar Farm, which boasts 417,000 PV modules, is situated between Chinchilla and Miles on a 1,009-acre site. It is expected to generate approximately 440 GWh of clean energy per year, or enough to power the equivalent of 100,000 households. 
Constructed by Sterling & Wilson, Queensland government-owned electricity generation company CS Energy has agreed to purchase 100% of the solar farm’s renewable energy generation for the first 10 years of operation.
Powerlink Chief Executive Paul Simshauser said the grid-connection activities, which involved building two kilometers of transmission line and completing works at the existing Columboola Substation, will help the renewable energy generated at the Columboola Solar Farm to be delivered to the National Electricity Market (NEM). 
“After many months of dedicated on-ground work, our project team has been able to bring construction activities to a close – safely, on-time and on-budget,” said Simshauser. “The project was technically complex and required meticulous planning, with the new stretch of transmission line crossing directly under an existing 275kV line. We will complete final testing and commissioning works in coming months as construction activities at the solar farm progress.”
CS Energy CEO Andrew Bills described the transmission works as a milestone.
“The Columboola Solar Farm is the largest renewable energy offtake in CS Energy’s portfolio and we are excited to see the project reach this stage,” he said. “CS Energy continues to diversify our portfolio with these kinds of offtakes, which enable us to offer renewable energy to our customers and support Queensland’s 50% renewables target by 2030.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/13/romania-authorizes-bilateral-ppas-raises-size-limit-for-solar-under-net-metering-to-400kw/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ROMANIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 13, 2022","Romania authorizes bilateral PPAs, raises size limit for solar under net metering to 400kW","Romania's government has recently introduced a series of amendments to the country's energy law that create more favorable conditions for both the solar distributed-generation segment and the utility scale section of the market.
“The government Emergency Ordinance no. 143/2021 finally removes the PPA ban from the Energy Law no. 123/2012, after almost 10 years,” Mihaela Nyerges from Romanian law firm Vlăsceanu, Nyerges & Partners told pv magazine. “It also introduced new, more favorable net metering provisions.”
As for the power purchase agreements (PPAs), Nyerges explained that, although in mid-2020 the government had inserted an exception from the ban – applicable to new power generation capacities only and in an attempt to stimulate new investments in power generation – during the parliamentary examination of the ordinance the exception was rejected by the first parliamentary chamber and the second parliamentary chamber never examined the ordinance.
“Although the ordinance continued to be in full force, in the absence of a formal rejection by the second parliamentary chamber, it was never relied on by the market participants or by the financing banks,” she further explained. “Since a complete restructuring of the energy law was high on the agenda of the authorities, the entire market has been standing by for the final version thereof.”
“Finally, participants on the wholesale electricity market are again allowed to enter into directly negotiated power purchase agreements. This is great news for the renewables sector and this can unlock the much-needed new investments in new capacities that can help alleviate the current situation on the energy market,” the executive director of the Romanian Photovoltaic Industry Association (RPIA), Mihai Balan, told pv magazine.
According to Nyerges, these new provisions are ensuring legal certainty to make investors more confident in the Romanian energy market. “During the last couple of months we could sense from the market that negotiations on PPAs are becoming more frequent and that banks are getting more open and interested in financing investments in renewables based on such PPAs,” she stated.
As for the new rules for distributed generation, the Romanian government has decided to raise the size limit for power generators under the net metering regime from 100 to 400kW. “More importantly, prosumers of up to 200kW will now benefit from 1:1 quantitative compensation until 2030,” Balan added. “There are no newly introduced additional obligations for them.”
“This measure is intended to stimulate investments by prosumers and increase generation near the point of consumption,” Nyerges commented. “Within the next 60 days, the regulator, ANRE, should issue the secondary legislation for the implementation of the new principles.”
The Romanian government also recently revealed plans to hold the country's first tender for utility scale renewables projects, in the first half of this year.
Large scale solar projects now under development in Romania include, among others, arrays being built for coal power supplier Complexul Energetic Oltenia (CE Oltenia). It plans to build eight PV plants with a combined capacity of 725MW at several of its coal power facilities. Other PV projects that are now in the works include a 111MW solar park by OMV Petrom, an energy supplier that is majority-owned by Austria's OMV, as well as a 700MW solar project that will be spread across the municipalities of Grăniceri and Pilu. In addition, CE Oltenia is developing 310MW of solar at one of its coal power facilities.
Romania is also supporting rooftop PV deployment via the Casa Verde Fotovoltaice (green PV home) scheme for residential solar installations, under the national net metering regime. According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, Romania had 1.39GW of solar installed by the end of 2020.

Eurostat has produced figures for 2020 which indicated nuclear plants generated almost a quarter of the bloc's electricity in that year, with the leading nuclear member states of France, Germany, Spain, and Sweden producing more than three quarters of that 684TWh figure.
While a 67% figure for France's reactor-generated electricity reiterated the nation's status as the EU's biggest nuclear state, the numbers for the other dozen states concerned highlighted how much work renewables will have to perform, particularly in Belgium. Nuclear, which Belgian legislators have pledge to phase out by the end of 2025, provided 39% of the country's electricity in 2020, according to Eurostat.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for this year look even more promising.
And while the low carbon power source – which appears set to be, controversially, defined as sustainable by the European Commission despite perennial concerns over waste material and plant accidents – provided only 11% of Germany's electricity in 2020, the government there has committed to closing down its last reactors this year. Spain, which sourced 22% of its electricity from nuclear in 2020, has promised to phase out the power source this decade.
With France accounting for around 52% of the EU's nuclear electricity generation in 2020 – 354TWh, according to Eurostat – Germany and Spain generated 64.4TWh and 58.3TWh, respectively, and Sweden provided around 7% of the total figure by generating 49.2TWh of reactor-sourced power.
Eurostat said nuclear provided 54% of the electricity used in Slovakia in 2020, 46% in Hungary, 41% in Bulgaria, 38% in Slovenia, 37% in Czechia, 34% in Finland, 30% in Sweden, 21% in Romania, and 3% in the Netherlands.
Proponents of nuclear argue its low-carbon nature justifies its inclusion in the European Commission's taxonomy of sustainable power sources, which also appears likely to include fossil fuel natural gas.
At the start of the week, Eurostat published figures indicating the supply of electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning – a grouping the statistical body made – had achieved the largest relative and absolute falls in greenhouse gas emissions between the earliest reference year available, 2008, and 2020. The falls reported during that period were of 41% and 481 million tons of carbon equivalent, respectively, with the latter figure falling from 1.2 billion tons in 2008 to 719 million in 2020.
Eurostat said manufacturing supplied the largest volume of EU carbon emissions in 2020, with 740 million tons, ahead of the supply of power as defined above, with 719 million tons, and household emissions of 693 million tons.
The total emissions figure for the bloc fell 9% from 2019 and 24% since 2008, according to the EU institution.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/01/13/work-underway-on-teslas-rooftop-solar-system/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JANUARY 13, 2022",Work underway on Tesla’s rooftop solar system in Texas,"From pv magazine USA
Tesla’s ongoing construction of its Texas Gigafactory appears to have reached the stage where solar panels are being installed. According to information posted by one of many individuals who fly drones over the active construction site, the three main manufacturers are Longi for the solar panels, Unirac for the mechanical racking, and SolarEdge for the inverters.
Drone pilot Joe Tegtmeyer has posted a video on YouTube showing the hardware that is being deployed. The 20-minute video starts with a discussion of the hardware, with Tegtmeyer noting the manufacturers.
At the 7:15 mark of the video, the drone crests the western edge of the building, bringing the pallets of gear into focus. Then, by about the 8:00 mark, the drone heads off to other parts of the structure.
 

The drone operator speculates that the Longi solar panels are Hi-MO5 bifacial products. While this might be true, the images and video do not confirm the specifications of the panels. However, the racking hardware specifications are quite clearly Unirack’s RM10 EVO product. This product is a ballasted racking solution that is specifically designed for bifacial solar panels. It is angled at 10 degrees and faces south.
The third manufacturer noted in the Tegtmeyer video is SolarEdge. While there are no drone shots close enough to read the labels, one can assume SolarEdge’s Synergy product line is used.
When building the first Gigafactory in Nevada, Tesla suggested that the plant would have the world’s largest rooftop solar power plant, at approximately 70MW (DC). But in the years since, that solar power installation has never been completed.
It was recently suggested that the first Gigafactory installation will now be sized closer to 22 MW. While that wouldn’t break any world records, it could still earn the respectable title of largest rooftop solar power installation in the United States.
At the Texas Gigafactory, reporters have not attempted to guess the size of the solar rooftop. So, this author did a very rough – and not fully compliant – design in Helioscope to give readers an idea of the scope of this colossal structure.
The 4.2 million-square-foot outline could hold approximately 114,000 Longi LR5-HBD-545M solar panels. The total wattage of these solar panels could reach 62MW. If we remove 5% of those panels to meet local fire inspector regulations for walkways, the facility could potentially host as much as 59MW of capacity.
The multi-story manufacturing facility could probably use most of that electricity, but for now, that information is still unknown. It seems reasonable to assume that the facility will contain at least some integrated energy storage as a hedge against Texas’ questionably winterized power grid/natural gas situation, especially given Tesla’s world-leading expertise on the topic.
