https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/02/solar-philippines-begins-working-on-4-gw-solar-park/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ASIA,PHILIPPINES",ANGELA SKUJINS,"JANUARY 2, 2024",Solar Philippines begins working on 4 GW solar park,"Solar Philippines, the listed unit of Manila-based PV module manufacturer and project developer SP New Energy Corp. (SPNEC), confirmed today it has started clearing land for what is poised to be the company’s flagship 4 GW Terra Solar development in Nueva Ecija and Bulacan, located in the northern Philippines.
The company claims this is the world’s largest solar project made up of 3.5 GW of solar panels with 4 GWh of battery storage. The project is estimated to cost PHP 200 billion ($3.59 million) and be completed by early 2026.
“This will be one of the largest solar projects not just in Asia but in the world,” said Manuel Pangilinan, chairman and CEO of the country’s electric power distribution company, Meralco.
Solar Philippines first announced in 2021 it would build a 500 MW solar farm on former ranch land in Peñaranda. In December of that year, SPNEC also made its debut on the Philippine Stock Exchange, setting its initial public offering at PHP 1 per share. In 2022, the company unveiled its plans to add 3.5 GW to the original 500 MW solar farm in Luzon, expanding the project eightfold.
At the time, SPNEC said it was using the proceeds from various capital raises to acquire the land for the 3.5 GW project extension, including a previously announced stock rights offering to raise at least PHP 10 billion ($179 million), as well as planned asset-for-share swap with parent company Solar Philippines, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2022.
Solar Philippines founder Leandro Leviste said the company had tried to secure land permits with the Department of Energy since 2016 to shore up the project, which will extend 60 kilometers to connect to NGCP’s (National Grid Corp. of the Philippines) substations that supply the Greater Manila Area.
Legal reforms and a liberalized energy market have tapped the Philippines to be “the place” when developing large-scale solar arrays in Southeast Asia, one analyst told pv magazine.
The Philippines aims to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030, with a possible focus on mini-grids and standalone clean power systems due to the country's archipelagic nature, according to a 2022 report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/02/lebanon-introduces-peer-to-peer-renewable-energy-trading/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,LEBANON",ILIAS TSAGAS,"JANUARY 2, 2024",Lebanon introduces peer-to-peer renewable energy trading,"On Dec. 14, the Lebanese parliament passed the Decentralized Renewable Energy Law (DRE), which deals with two types of regulations: net-metering and peer-to-peer contracts between private sector entities.
Pierre El Khoury, general director and president of the Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC) board, told pv magazine that the “LCEC expects the DRE law will create momentum for some additional 800 to 1,200 MW in the next few years.”
Peer-to-peer contracts between buyers and sellers are limited to renewable energy, with a maximum capacity of 10 MW per project. When a buyer and the seller are located on the same or adjacent land plots, peer-to-peer power exchanges can take place without using the national grid of state-owned utility Electricité du Liban (EDL). When projects sell generated electricity far from a production site, power trading must occur through wheeling, using the EDL grid.
“In a congested city with high-rise buildings like Beirut, entities that do not have enough space on their rooftop can now and thanks to the DRE law use available spaces anywhere in Lebanon,” said El Khoury.
Projects that use the wheeling option will also have to pay wheeling fees to EDL. These fees will be determined by Lebanon’s energy regulator, which has not been appointed yet. In addition to lacking a regulator at present, the intermittent operation of Lebanon’s electricity grid could pose another challenge to the implementation of the DRE law.
El Khoury said that EDL is only supplying electricity today for about six to 10 hours per day. However, he said that “the medium voltage network of EDL is energized all the time, so new peer-to-peer projects could connect to the medium voltage at a first stage. The LCEC estimates that with more solar (and other renewable energy technologies) to be connected to the EDL grid, EDL supply will increase significantly in a relatively short period of time.”
The new DRE law has also introduced various types of net metering, such as individual net metering, multiple-tenants net metering, collective net metering, and other options.
Marc Ayoub, associate fellow at the American University of Beirut's Issam Fares Institute and a non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, told pv magazine that “since 2011, net metering has been a decision taken at the level of the board of EDL and renewed on a yearly basis, just until the [country’s] economic collapse (2018-19) where no more meters were installed.” Therefore, the DRE law is the first time net metering “is mentioned in a law, or legalized in a law issued by the Lebanese parliament,” he said.
Since 2020, Lebanon’s solar sector has been booming because of off-grid photovoltaic and battery installations developed at the residential and commercial levels.
“Those are all potential net metering subscribers who can put their excess power generated from solar on the national grid,” said Ayoub.
For this to happen, Lebanon needs a reliable network with electricity flowing at all times and a central utility that installs meters and balances the electricity profiles of net-metering subscribers.
“This is why laws are not enough, and a holistic approach for reforms at all levels of the [electricity] sector is required, including generation, transmission and distribution of electricity,” he said.
Ayoub added that the establishment of an independent and empowered regulatory authority that can meet its duties under the DRE law is also a priority.
Lebanon installed less than 100 MW of solar in 2020. The country now has about 1,300 MW of PV capacity, mainly from small solar-plus-battery systems.

“We have indeed considered the possibility of powering the heat pump with PV,” corresponding author Tomi Thomasson told pv magazine. “However, relying solely on PV is not deemed feasible, given the limited solar hours in the Nordics. Grid electricity is essential to ensure an adequate number of annual operating hours and sufficient drying quantities.”
“We recognize that PV can play a complementary role in this setup,” Thomasson added. “With local PV production, we could avoid electricity transmission costs and potentially increase the feasible operating hours for the heat pump. Furthermore, local PV production could help reduce investment risks associated with the price volatility in the electricity market.”
The scientists built an experimental setup consisting of two freight containers. In the first, they installed a 24 kW heat pump, a condenser, an evaporator, a heat recovery unit, a heat exchanger, and 12 flat-plate solar heat collector modules. The second container consists of a drying chamber for fresh wood chips in size classes P16 and F15.
“The main role of the heat pump is to remove moisture from the drying air, but it can also provide additional heat at the beginning of the drying process since, to work efficiently, the drying air temperature must reach at least 20 ◦C before switching the heat pump into a drying mode,” they added.

Under its hybrid mode, the system uses closed-loop drying, where the same air is circulated through the system. If solar radiation is also available, the thermal collectors provide an additional heat input. In its solar mode, the system only uses collectors to dry the biomass.
The scientists conducted 34 hybrid experiments totaling 316 hours on the setup in 2021 and 2022 in Finland.
The setup results showed that hybrid drying results in higher and faster drying rates. The average drying rates were 32.96 kg/h with solar drying. However, as the heat pump was powered from the grid, the decreased drying duration was enabled by increased electricity consumption.
The heat pump needs 8.24 kW to dry the wood, while the solar mode requires 1.45 kW for the fan used for airflow. “Due to the improved drying rate, the specific electricity consumption in hybrid operation mode is only 45% higher at 0.26 kWhe/kg compared to 0.18 kWhe/kg,” the academics stated.
The researchers then used some collected data points to build a model that can assume drying rates and power consumption under different operating conditions. Those estimation methods, which used a gradient boosting model and a multiple linear regression model, received an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.27 (deviation of 5.9%) for the drying rate and an average MAE of 0.88 (deviation of 8.9%) for the power consumption.
Then, the researchers fed the results of this model, along with weather and market data, into an optimization model.

The optimization model gave results in the form of payback time for the system, considering three varied parameters and their combinations: the value increase of biomass in drying, the cost of biomass, and the average price of electricity. The researchers focused their analysis on the terms of a pilot-scale system and a commercial system.
“For the pilot-scale unit, the investment cost was determined based on the actual procurement cost, while for the commercial unit, the cost was estimated considering the economies of scale and a reduced instrumentation requirement compared to the pilot-scale unit,” they explained.
The research found the payback time for the commercial scale project to be 7.5 years, while it was 10.1 years for the pilot scale. When considering a 30% investment subsidy, those rates fell to 5.3 years and 7.1 years, respectively. When considering biogenic CO2 compensation, the payback times decrease to 4.8 and 6.5 years.
“Operating flexibility is required to achieve the estimated economic feasibility,” the research team explained. “The flexibility potential decreased in colder temperatures due to an exponential increase in required preheating time. Based on the economic analysis, the benefit of operating flexibility increases with the electricity price, as the optimal operation shifts from nearly constant hybrid drying towards increased solar drying and nonoperating hours.”
The system was introduced in the paper “Experimental and techno-economic analysis of solar-assisted heat pump drying of biomass,” which was recently published in Energy Reports.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/02/homeowners-improving-solar-plus-battery-payback-period-with-vpps/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JANUARY 2, 2024",Homeowners improving solar-plus-battery payback period with VPPs,"From pv magazine USA
Rooftop solar is evolving. In many markets across the United States, net metering is actively being phased out, meaning that standalone solar arrays aren’t able to capture meaningful value for sending their excess electricity production to the grid in exchange for credits on their bill.
As net metering credits phase out, home battery energy storage systems are increasingly being attached with rooftop solar to ensure homeowners can store and consume their locally produced clean energy, avoiding peak demand charges that occur in the afternoon.
However, solar-plus-battery systems can do more than just store and self-consume power in a day-to-night cycle. These distributed energy resources can work in concert, along with HVAC systems and home appliances, to smooth out demand across the grid, creating more stability in electricity markets, and eliminating the supply and demand imbalance phenomenon known as the “duck curve.”
Programs that coordinate these distributed resources are often referred to as VPPs. By participating in a VPP, rooftop solar and battery customers can leverage their resources and get paid by a VPP administrator.
“Home solar and batteries can play an essential role in maintaining grid operations and keeping electricity costs down for everyone,” said Aaron Nitzkin, executive vice president of solar at Citadel Roofing and Solar.
Take Enphase, for example, which just gained approval to enroll its home battery, the IQ Battery 5P, into VPP programs in three major markets. California PG&E customers, Long Island PSEG customers, and many other markets are all able to earn extra revenues from their clean energy assets. Here’s how they work:
California’s Pacific Gas & Electric utility runs an Emergency Load Reduction Program. Customers who enroll their batteries will earn $2 per kWh from PG&E for electricity stored in their batteries to reduce demand on the grid during peak load periods. The program’s demand response events are scheduled to occur during hot summer days between May and October. Between 20 and 60 event hours will be scheduled during each “season.”
Homeowners can expect to earn between $100 to $250 per year, said PG&E. That equates to between $2,500 and $6,250 over a 25-year life of a rooftop solar array.
Long Island, New York’s PSEG utility offers a Battery Storage Rewards program. The program pays an upfront incentive from installers of at least $250 per kWh of usable battery capacity, with a cap of $6,250 per household. For example, homeowners with two IQ Battery 5Ps offering 10 kWh of usable capacity will receive an upfront discount of $2,500 from their Enphase installer as part of the program. In return for the upfront incentive, customers agree to let PSEG Long Island use the electricity in their batteries to reduce demand during peak electricity use periods about 10 times per year. Power sharing would occur automatically under the program.
“Grid services programs unlock more value for homeowners with batteries, which expand access to this critical technology,” said Michael Catizone, president and co-founder at Long Island Power Solutions, a leading solar installation company in New York. “As electrification increases and demand on the grid grows, we’re excited to expand deployments.”

The initiative, first announced in November, aims to pay for the purchase and installation of 6 kW of rooftop solar programs equating to 16 solar panels at public schools.
Education Minister Norma Foley said the scheme allows schools to reduce carbon emissions while slashing energy costs.
Panels would be connected to the electricity grid, leading to €1,200 ($1,310) to €1,600 per annum in savings, according to the government. Schools from 11 districts could sign up in the first application round which opened in mid-November and is expected to reach completion in May this year.
Western Galway county recorded the most applications, followed by Donegal, Dublin City Council and Kerry. The remaining 2,400 schools will be invited to apply over the next 12 months in two more scheduled phases.
The program is rolled out in phases to ensure a steady flow of work for electricians and installers, with data gathered during the first phase to allow for improvements in the second and third phases, the government said in a press release.
The program aims to reduce climate emissions but also “encourage more companies to enter the installer market,” according to the announcement. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland reports roughly 550 non-domestic and domestic solar installers are registered with the national energy agency.
Ireland recorded 135 MW of installed solar capacity at the end of 2022, according to its most up-to-date estimates from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
A report by Ireland’s Solar Energy Association (ISEA) puts this figure much higher, claiming around 680 MW of solar power has been deployed across 59,888 generators in Ireland as of July 2023. Most of this capacity originates from seven large-scale plants surpassing 5 MW totaling 349 MW, the organization said.

Thresholding is the process that converts a micrograph into a binary black and white image, corresponding to particle and background. It does so by setting a threshold for pixel brightness.
“Image analysis has often been used to characterize the soiling accumulated on glass coupons,” the research lead author, Leonardo Micheli told PV magazine.
“However, different options in the image analysis methodology can lead to dissimilar results for the same micrograph, even if the software is the same,” added research co-author, Greg P. Smestad. “This is in part due to the absence of a standardized method. So, we decided to look at the uncertainty that the image analysis process can introduce in the estimations of soiling for real-world conditions.”
The research has looked into 16 thresholding methodologies, all available through the ImageJ software, which is a Java-based image processing program developed at the University of Wisconsin's National Institutes of Health and the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation (LOCI).
The methods are called Default, Huang, Intermodes, IsoData, Li, MaxEntropy, Mean, MinError, Minimum, Moments, Otsu, Percentile, RenyiEntropy, Shanbhag, Triangle and Yen. To perform the analysis, the researchers produced 13,200 micrographs of glass coupons soiled for 1 to 32 days. They were collected from Algeria, Australia, Chile, Jordan, Cape Verde, Morocco, Qatar, Spain and the United States.
The results of the various thresholding methodologies were then compared in terms of the coefficient of variation and the relative deviation from the average. In addition, a survey was conducted among 18 soiling experts to assess the reliability of the different methodologies visually.
“Overall, the ‘Triangle' method appears to be the best option among the investigated methodologies for the soiling conditions analyzed in this study,” the academic group found. “Indeed, it returns the minimum coefficient of variation and a mean deviation closer to zero. It was also one of the two methods that were most often selected as best by the participants in the survey.”

According to the researchers, the Triangle method sets the threshold as the point of maximum distance between the pixel intensity histogram and the line between the histogram peak and the farthest end of the histogram. “Due to its approach,” they explained, “this algorithm is particularly well suited for images with a dominant background, as in these cases and in most soiling studies.”
Then, using the excelling Triangle thresholding method, the scientist moved forward to investigate the effect of the nonuniform distribution of soiling on the glass coupons. As soiling is not uniformly distributed over a PV panel, micrographs taken at different spots on the same coupon might return different results.
“It was found that, in order to keep the estimation error lower than +/- 5%, more than one micrograph should be taken per coupon,” the scientists concluded. “The recommended number of measurements typically increases with the soiling loss, and therefore it can be expected to be higher: 1) in locations with high soiling levels, and 2) as the number of days of exposure increases.”
All results were presented in “Soiling in Solar Energy Systems: The Role of the Thresholding Method in Image Analysis,” published on Solar RRL.

PowerGen will use the systems for a series of projects in Sierra Leone under the Rural Renewable Energy Project (RREP) initiative. The UK Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO) provided about €44 million ($48.5 million) of funding for the project, which will be overseen by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/02/novel-tin-selenide-solar-cell-design-promises-36-45-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BANGLADESH",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 2, 2024",Novel tin selenide solar cell design promises 36.45% efficiency,"Researchers at the University of Rajshahi in Bangladesh have made a new attempt to design solar cells based on a tin selenide (SnSe) absorber and claim their new solution may lead to the development of highly efficient devices.
“SnSe has innate p-type electrical conductivity which raises the possibility of using it as an absorber material in photovoltaic solar energy technology,” the scientists said, noting that this compound has so far reached low efficiencies in practical solar cell applications. “According to the Shockley-Queisser index, the maximum photovoltaic conversion efficiency for each type of SnSe structure is estimated to be around 32%.”
The solar cell is planned to be fabricated with an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, an n-type cadmium sulfide (CdS) window layer with a bandgap of 2.40 eV, a p-type SnSe absorber with a bandgap of 1.20 eV, a p-type copper/indium/selenium (CIS) thin-film layer with a bandgap of 1.12 eV, a back surface field (BSF) layer made of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) with a bandgap of 1.65 eV, and a nickel (Ni) metal contact.
In the proposed cell configuration, the CdS window has a thickness of 100 nm, which the scientists said mitigates parasitic absorption, and the SnSE absorber has a thickness of 600 nm, which should balance between maximizing absorption and avoiding loss due to carrier recombination.
“The 200 nm thickness for the CIS augmenter represents an optimized value where higher thickness doesn't significantly enhance efficiency,” they further explained. “Lastly, the 100 nm thickness for the WSe2 BSF was chosen as its impact was relatively low in this context.”
The research group tested the solar cell design through a series of simulations via the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells that was developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium for modeling solar cell performance.
The researchers chose as a reference cell a single-junction PV device with 26.12% power conversion efficiency and based uniquely on a SnSE absorber and a CdS layer. Their simulations showed that with the addition of the BSF layer, the cell efficiency can be raised to 33.88%, and that adding a CIS layer may raise it to up to 36.45%.
“But the final proposed n-CdS/p-SnSe/p+-CuInSe2/p++-WSe2 device is able to generate high current and voltage,” they stated. “This figure clearly indicates that the current enhances enormously to 42.54 from 38.62 mA/cm2.” The cell also achieved an open-circuit voltage of 1.010 V and a fill factor of 85.01%.
The solar cell design was presented in the paper “Modeling and efficiency enhancement of SnSe thin film solar cell with a thin CIS layer,” published in Results in Materials. “These in-depth simulation findings demonstrate the enormous potential of the SnSe absorber with the CIS current boosting layer for the creation of a thin film solar cell that is both affordable and highly efficient,” the academics concluded.
