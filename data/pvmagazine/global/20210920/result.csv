Bavarian photovoltaic company Anumar has officially commissioned its Schornhof solar park – located in Berg im Gau, 20km southwest of Ingolstadt – with a capacity of 120 MW. According to the company, it is the largest ground-mounted PV installation in southern Germany.
The project owner, Norway's Statkraft, secured two long-term PPAs for the clean power to be generated by 90 MW of the plant's generation capacity.
Anumar said it wants to expand the solar park by 60 MW in the coming year. The area should then grow from 140ha today to 200ha. The municipality of Berg im Gau has already approved the project expansion.
Markus Brosch, responsible for the planning, technology and construction of solar parks at Anumar, emphasized that the Schornhof facility was very special for the company in many ways. “Due to the size of the system, we built our own substation which now supplies the electricity generated directly to the high-voltage network,” explained Brosch. Over 1,000km of cables were laid in the solar park and the approximately 350,000 modules were mounted on particularly high-quality, specially coated posts for peatland.
Anumar invested around €60 million in the construction of the facility, for which it will also provide O&M services. “The Schornhof solar park will be the largest connected solar power plant in Bavaria that will be implemented and operated with the help of a combination of PPAs and EEG funding,” said, in August, Anumar managing director Andreas Klier, referring to the German renewable energy law, the Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG).
The German developer is also developing an unsubsidized 300 MW solar park in Anklam, a town in the Western Pomerania region of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

“We are happy to announce the commencement of another successful partnership in Brazil with Helte Solar – our exclusive distributor in Parana state. We have a strong commitment together with Helte to provide high-quality solar modules to the regional market also to the customers nationwide,” said David Tsaava, LatAm Regional Manager for AE Solar.
“The consolidated partnership between Helte and the German manufacturer Tier 1 AE Solar, consists in the search for high technology and quality products, bringing even more competitiveness to our customers and partners. This partnership, despite just starting, is already one of the largest distribution contracts in Brazil,” added Lucas Schmidt, General Manager at Helte.
Brazil is one of the most advanced countries in South America, when it comes to the deployment of renewable energies. The country has excellent levels of solar radiation, and a significant solar PV capacity, which surpassed 8GW in the first quarter of 2021. This technology is expected to dominate the Brazilian solar energy market in the coming years. As demand grows, an increasing number of Chinese firms are attracted to the market; however, AE Solar is also rapidly increasing its local presence.
AE Solar has grown steadily over the past few years to both broaden its portfolio and strengthen its presence in the international marketplace. The module manufacturer now operates in more than 95 countries. The company has a wide range of distributors in local markets and is continuously striving to increase its global solar footprint.

The Punjab Power Development Board (PPDB) is currently seeking consultants to conduct a feasibility study for the deployment of solar plants on canals spread across the Gujranwala division, which is an administrative division in northern Punjab; and at the Rakh branch, which is a canal originating from Lower Chenab canal, in Gujranwala, and ending at Samundri, in Faisalabad district.
“Punjab has one of the widest-spread canal network[s] in the region; comprising of lined and unlined channels,” the authority said in the tender document. “Installations of solar PV panels on canal[s] … can avoid [the] use of expensive land for generating environment-friendly power. The generated electricity can be used by nearby localities or industry.”
The selected consultants will have to identify all lined and unlined canal parcels and distributary, minor canals that are suitable for canal-top solar power generation; and suitable power infrastructure located nearby, and select six sites. The deadline to submit proposals has been set for September 30.
According to a recent study from the University of California, Santa Cruz, in the United States, solar canals are already competitive with ground-mounted PV. Solar plants on canals have already been successfully built in India, where this technology has shown that solar power can also be generated without occupying land and, at the same time, reduce water evaporation.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/20/high-energy-prices-are-more-of-a-threat-than-an-opportunity-for-renewables/,"GEOPOLITICS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2021",‘High energy prices are more of a threat than an opportunity for renewables’,"Rising electricity and gas prices are currently putting the global economy under heavy pressure and also highlighting the world's dependence on fossil fuels, particularly gas, at a time when energy demand is growing significantly and supply is becoming scarce. According to several analysts, this crisis may represent a unique opportunity for renewable energy sources and green hydrogen, as soaring prices make them much more competitive.
Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute for International Affairs, pointed out, however, that the crisis may not necessarily become a real opportunity for the renewable energy industry. “Those who claim that this is an opportunity for renewables are experts taking a rational approach and long-term perspective,” he told pv magazine. “A rational consumer may take it as an impulse to install solar panels on their house. However, politics and popular perceptions are also very important and not always rational. I think the high prices are more of a threat than an opportunity for renewables and it will be important to keep a cap on prices to avoid long-term political damage.”
It is difficult to say what the overall impact on the world economy will be, though high costs and instability are rarely beneficial for economic growth, the geopolitics expert said. “Some people will incur very high energy costs, while others will earn a lot. If things get really bad, one solution would be to open the Nord Stream gas pipeline for full usage and another possibility is a drop in support for decarbonization and the popularity of green parties in Europe.”
Several factors may contribute to bringing prices back down again, such as a mild autumn and winter, windier and sunnier weather in Northern Europe, more rain in major hydropower countries such as Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, and the Nord Stream gas pipeline coming into full service. “More interconnectors should have been built,” he stressed. “Phasing out German nuclear power at the planned rate is a folly and old gas and coal power plants should be kept in reserve for situations like this until the renewable energy system and storage are more developed.”
The current crisis, in his view, has shown that Europe is still very dependent on gas, and increasingly dependent on Russian gas. “In the long term, this is probably not a good thing for Russian gas, which would probably be better off flying below the radar,” he further explained. “At a superficial level, the crisis indicates that it was a good idea to build the Nord Stream pipeline. In a sense, the Russians can say that they have been anticipating and saying this out aloud all along: Europe needs Russian gas.”
Major Northern European countries that are heavily dependent on renewables and or energy imports may be affected most, Overland added. If it turns into a quarrel between Russia and the EU or Ukraine, Ukraine and Central European countries could suffer. Tensions could increase between Russia and its various gas customers, between green and fossil forces in the EU, between Central and Northern European countries, for example between Poland and Germany, he points out. The Poles could blame the Germans for building the Nord Stream pipeline and expanding too much their renewable energy capacity, leaving Poland dependent on gas supplies from its arch-enemy Russia. “The Poles could tell the Germans to leave their coal in peace, and the Germans could answer that if they had all built more renewable energy faster, they might not have such a situation,” Overland stressed.

The London-based business, which is half owned by British energy company BP, said the finance package – which includes trade credit, which offers the user the chance to take goods and pay later – had been secured from lenders in France, Spain, the U.K., Japan, Canada, and the U.S.
Pick up your copy of the September edition of pv magazine today for a detailed update on solar and battery storage in the United States, which faces a tough decision between taking advantage of Asian imports, or developing domestic manufacturing at the risk of slowing progress towards decarbonization.
The credit facilities will be provided by French banks BNP Paribas and Société Générale; Spanish institution Santander; U.K. government-controlled NatWest and domestic peer Lloyds; Japanese institutions Mitsubishi UFJ and Sumitomo Mitsui; Canadian financiers Canadian Imperial and Toronto Dominion; and U.S. brand Wells Fargo. A press release issued by Lightsource BP this morning did not indicate how much each lender had contributed to the package.
The clean energy company estimated its 25 GW push will create around 500 jobs over the next four years and said it had developed 3.8 GW of solar capacity since forerunner Lightsource was founded, 11 years ago.
Lightsource group chief executive Nick Boyle, quoted in the press release, said: “Globally, renewable energy is shifting from a mindset of gigawatts to terawatts. Investments are being made by the billion, not the million. And big companies like Amazon, McDonald’s and eBay are switching to clean energy. This trend proves that renewables are mainstream and solar is playing a key role in addressing the climate crisis. If we’re going to meet the commitments of the Paris Agreement, business as usual isn’t going to cut it. Our industry-leading 25 GW by 2025 target, and the finance package, are further proof that Lightsource BP has left business as usual far behind.”
Lightsource joint owner BP in June announced it would spend $220 million “and 1 GW of ‘safe harbor' equipment” to acquire a 9 GW solar portfolio in the U.S. from Texas-based developer 7X Energy, with Lightsource BP to develop the project capacity. Lightsource today indicated that 9 GW is not included in its 25 GW target.

Adani Solar will start the commercial production of 540 W mono PERC modules in November. It further plans to launch 640 W modules by March 2023.
Currently, the company has a 1.5 GW manufacturing capacity for polycrystalline cells and modules, which it is expanding to 3.5 GW with the addition of another 2 GW capacity equipped to handle high-output modules.
“The 2 GW addition will be operational by November end this year,” Cecil Augustine, head of retail at Adani Solar, told pv magazine. “It will be equipped to produce bifacial and mono PERC modules with a peak output of 540 W.” The company plans to start producing 640 W modules by the end of the next fiscal year.
With the existing 1.5 GW, Adani Solar claims 70% of the overall cell manufacturing capacity in India. The company produces polycrystalline modules with individual output of 340 Wp.
Premier Energies, which currently has 1.25 GW module and 0.75 MW cell capacity, is showcasing 166 mm mono PERC modules with peak output of 445 W, and 182 mm mono PERC modules with 540 Wp output.
“The efficiency of 445 Wp modules ranges from 20.5% to 20.9%, and for 540 Wp modules 20.9-21.5%. The company plans on launching bifacial modules soon,” Amit Magnani, Premier Energies' vice president of business development, told pv magazine.
Jakson is showcasing its Helia series modules with an output of 600 Wp. The modules are developed using M10 half-cut mono PERC cells. Combined with multi-busbar technology and high-density interconnections, these achieve an efficiency of over 21%.
Currently, Jakson has a module capacity of 600 MW per annum, which it is scaling to 1 GW. The facility is equipped to produce Helia series modules in both monofacial and bifacial versions, ranging from 440 Wp to 600 Wp.
Vikas Singh, deputy director for sales and marketing at China’s Jinchen Machinery, told pv magazine that out of 10 GW of its production line ordered by Indian manufacturers, equipment for 3 GW is already installed and production has started. It shall deliver the remaining 7 GW of equipment within six months.
Some EPC installers are also in talks with Jinchen to source its machinery as they plan to make their own modules. Singh expects to freeze one or two orders from EPC players within this month.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/20/cpv-module-with-improved-short-circuit-current-via-microstructured-encapsulant-coatings/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2021",CPV module with improved short-circuit current via microstructured encapsulant coatings,"A French-Canadian research group and CPV specialist Stace have fabricated a triple-junction concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) module encapsulated with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer based on silica beads. The novelty of their approach consists in controlling the deposition of the silica beads through an additional manufacturing step, in which the microbeads are submerged into PDMS.
According to the researchers, the concept is compatible with high-volume manufacturing. “We haven’t estimated the cost for the cell since the supply chain is not fully available yet, so we cannot give an exact number of the extra cost of the microbeads layer,” Maxime Darnon, from the Laboratory of Nanotechnologies and Nanosystems, told pv magazine. “However, it is an add-on process in the manufacturing of CPV modules, therefore there is no need to fully redevelop the CPV module fabrication line, but just to add one step in the line.”
The CPV module relies on a 50 x 50 mm2 silicone-on-glass (SoG) Fresnel lens that concentrates direct sunlight onto hexagonally shaped high-efficiency triple-junction solar cells measuring 3 mm in width and built with three different III-V materials: indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) for the first junction; gallium-indium-arsenide (GaInAs) for the second element; and germanium for the third unit.
The researchers explained that PDMS is commonly utilized as a protective layer in CPV cells and added it also induces parasitic reflections at its interface with the air, which reduces light absorption. They minimized the reflection caused by this layer through the incorporation of a microstructured ARC consisting of a monolayer of silica beads submerged by around 25% into the PDMS layer itself.
The PDMS layer was spin-coated on the cells at a spin rate of 6,000 revolutions per minute for 120 seconds to obtain a thickness of around 6 micrometers, which the research group describes as having negligible effects on the optical performance of the device. The hexagonally close-packed silica beads were deposited on the PDM via a fluid flow process through which the beads are first placed on an easy-to-handle substrate and then moved onto the PDMS surface, which was developed by the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).
The CPV module developed with the new manufacturing process showed a short-circuit current that was up to 3.7% higher than that of a reference module. A series of simulations conducted by the group has also shown that this improvement may reach 4.8% with beads with a smaller diameter and a submergence degree of around 60%. “The microbeads have demonstrated their ability to lower the Fresnel reflection losses by providing a smooth optical transition from air to PDMS over a wide angular range,” it concluded.
The manufacturing process is described in full in the study “Microstructured antireflective encapsulant on concentrator solar cells,” published in Progress in Photovoltaics.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/20/electricity-taxes-levies-preventing-heat-pump-market-growing-in-europe/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,EUROPE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2021","Electricity taxes, levies preventing heat pump market growing in Europe","Creating more balanced taxation levels between electricity and gas will be key to making heat pump technologies compete with gas for heat supply in the European energy market. This is the main conclusion of a new report published by the European Heat Pump Association (EHPA), in which its experts claim that taxes and levies on electricity in Europe are currently unjustifiably higher than those applied to gas and other fossil fuels which, in turn, makes operating costs of heat pumps, inevitably higher.
According to the figures released by the EHPA, which do not take account of the current gas and electricity price hike, this market distortion affecting heat pump operating costs is felt more in Belgium, Germany, Ireland and Spain. In Germany, for example, taxes and levies applied to the electricity bills represent around 40% of the final price, which compares to only 26% for gas, and 32% for heating oil. “Energy taxation is key to creating a level playing field for renewable technologies in the heating sector,” the paper reads.
The EHPA experts claim that only a carbon tax may create the conditions for fair competition between heat pumps and gas, as was shown by the example of countries such as Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, Norway, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Slovenia, Portugal, and Estonia, with the first three nations of that list those with higher carbon prices, at €120/tCO2, €87/tCO2, and €62/tCO2, respectively.
“Since the introduction of [a carbon] tax, Sweden has seen a decrease in household energy use by 2.1%, and a phase-out of fuel oil, that was replaced, up to 75%, by district heating, and 25% by heat pumps,” the authors of the report stated. “These countries are faster in phasing out fossil fuels and decarbonizing their heating sector because it is possible to bridge the price gap between renewable and fossil fuel-based technologies via carbon pricing.”
The association has urged the European Commission to review the Energy Taxation Directive and to provide more consistent carbon price signals across energy sectors and EU member states. “Distorted energy prices are misleading consumers because the least sustainable heating technologies are perceived [to be] cheaper,” said the trade body's secretary-general, Thomas Nowak. “The actual cost of burning fossil energy is, however, not disappearing, it is instead covered by society at large.”
According to another recent study, the combined use of heat pumps and rooftop PV generation may be boosted in Europe by replacing current subsidies with a carbon tax policy. Their analysis showed that the profitability of this combination is strictly dependent on gas prices and that a slight increase in gas prices would be crucial to sustaining strong development.

“The company will use funding from the series A [round] to build a gigafactory in the United States, accelerate R&D efforts, and expand its sales force as it scales its distribution capabilities with strategic partnerships like the one announced with Schlumberger New Energy,” EnerVenue said in a statement, adding that the U.S. investment firm will also help expand its distribution channels in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and other regions.
The company's nickel-hydrogen battery technology is claimed to be able to operate at temperatures between -40 and 60 degrees Celsius, over a 30-year period. The manufacturer also says it can provide over 30,000 cycles without degradation and at varying rates, for a wide range of fast and slow charge capabilities. The battery has an efficiency ranging from 80 to 90%, depending on the cycle rate, and its energy density per square foot is equal to, or better than lithium-ion batteries, according to the company.
“EnerVenue builds durable, flexible, and safe energy storage solutions with batteries based on technology proven over decades of use under the most extreme aerospace conditions – including powering the International Space Station and Hubble Space Telescope,” the statement reads. “Following breakthrough material science discoveries that significantly [reduce] the cost and [increase] the raw material availability of the NASA-originated technology, EnerVenue launched in 2020, to bring the battery’s established advantages to grid scale and other stationary power applications.”
Conventional nickel-hydrogen batteries have been, so far, largely applied extensively in aerospace applications, such as in satellites and aircraft, and have shown good reliability, stability, and durability. Their utilization for terrestrial applications, however, is still hampered by the high costs of the platinum catalysts used for their production. The U.S. Department of Energy is targeting to reduce the cost of these devices to $100/kWh for stationary storage.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/20/pv-generated-hydrogen-cost-projected-to-drop-to-e0-7-and-e1-8-kg-by-2030/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2021",PV-generated hydrogen cost projected to drop to €0.7 and €1.8/kg by 2030,"A group of European researchers led by the European Technology and Innovation Platform for Photovoltaics (ETIP-PV) has sought to assess the capital (CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX) of hydrogen electrolysis powered by utility-scale solar for the next three decades and have predicted the cost of the green fuel may drop from around €0.031-€0.081/kWh currently to €0.02-€0.05 by 2030 and €0.01-€0.027 by 2050.
”We witness unprecedented growth of green hydrogen due to enormous pull on the demand side to opt for real solutions and a massive decline in utility-scale green hydrogen cost, driven by very low-cost solar PV and electrolysers,” professor of solar economy at the Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) in Finland, Christian Breyer, told pv magazine. “Huge business opportunities arise right now, for companies and countries, but only smart decision-makers in industry and policy will benefit.”
The projected cost decrease will be the result of a simultaneous price drop for both electrolysis powered by large-scale PV and the CAPEX of solar itself, according to their analysis, which was based on historical learning rates (LRs) for both technologies and a series of different growth scenarios. “The levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) is calculated for five European and five non-European locations with different solar irradiation levels and with several weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) rates,” they specified.
The set of locations include Helsinki, Finland; Munich, Germany; Toulouse, France; Rome, Italy; Malaga, Spain; Rajasthan, India; El Paso, Texas, USA; Western Australia; South Africa; and Chile's Atacama Desert.
The average CAPEX for utility-scale solar was calculated under three different scenarios: A fast growth scenario in which it is predicted to fall from around €0.047/kWh currently to €0.027/kWh in 2030 and €0.013/kWh in 2050; a base growth scenario in which this value should drop to €0.031/kWh in 2030 and €0.019/kWh in 2050; and a slow growth scenario where it reaches only €0.036/kWh in 2030 and €0.025/kWh in 2050.
The scientists assumed that every year the average module price may decrease by a conservative 25% and that average module efficiency improves by 0.4%. The OPEX in 2020 was estimated at €9.4/kW per year and it is assumed to decrease with 10% LR annually.
As for large-scale electrolyzers, the researchers found the CAPEX in the fast growth scenario may drop from €400/kW in 2020 to €230/kW in 2030 and €60/kW in 2050. Furthermore, they expect this price fall to reach €260/kW in 2030 and €80/kW in 2050 in a base growth scenario and €280/kW in 2030 and €130/kW in 2050 in a slow growth scenario.
“The state-of-the-art efficiency for alkaline electrolyzers is reported as 67%, which is assumed here to increase by 0.3% points per year to 76% by 2050,” the group further explained. “Costs of catalysts are not regarded as critical because nickel is the most common electrocatalyst in alkaline water electrolysis.”
In calculating the LCOH, the research team assumed that a PV plant is oversized in relation to the electrolyzer input power at a ratio of 1.33. Under this configuration, electrolyzers have 33% more full load hours (FLHs) compared to the PV yield in each location. A first-year 2% degradation and annual 0.5% degradation is estimated for the PV plant yield and an annual efficiency degradation of between 0.10 and 1.50% is assumed for the electrolyzer.
The academics specified that the current LCOH of solar-powered hydrogen currently reaches its lowest level of €0.031/kWh in the Atacama Desert in Chile, which is the region with the highest level of solar radiation in the world, and the highest value of €0.081/kWh in Helsinki, which is the region with the lowest radiation among the chosen locations. “By 2030 LCOH will decrease by about 33% and by 67% by 2050,” they emphasized. “It is notable that the cost of PV-generated electricity is already about 63% of the LCOH, increasing to about 74% by 2050. This suggests that electrolyzer CAPEX will not play a major role in the future LCOH development.”
According to the researchers, the LCOH will decrease to between €0.020 and €0.054/kWh or €0.7 and €1.8/kg by 2030 and €0.010 and €0.027/kWh or €0.3 and €0.9/kg by 2050. “Already during this decade, solar hydrogen will be globally a less expensive fuel compared with hydrogen produced from natural gas with carbon capture storage,” they concluded. “Best solar resource sites in the world reach full competitiveness of green hydrogen versus fossil methane-based hydrogen even without fossil carbon capture, today,” Breyer added. “Time for window-dressing and greenwashing is gone and major industries, such as steelmaking, chemical industry, marine shipping and aviation have to deliver real transition strategies to react on massive policy and investor pressure.”
Their findings and the associated methodology are described in the paper “The True Cost of Solar Hydrogen,” published in RRL Solar. The research team comprises scientists from the Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) in Finland, the Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA) in Spain, Italian research institute Eurac, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), and the Becquerel Institute in Belgium.

Red-tailed Tropic Birds wheeling above Lord Howe Island off Australia’s east coast have a new feature in their view and the island is more peaceful than it has been for many decades, given the successful segue to a hybrid solar and battery energy storage system delivered by Photon Energy Engineering Australia to provide at least 67% of the UNESCO World Heritage site’s electricity and displace as much as possible of its usually diesel-powered generation.
This weekend, the daily updated cumulative annual average of electricity delivered by the more than 1.2 MW solar array and the 3.712 MWh Tesla Powerpack was shown to be 74.35%.
For the past six months, the microgrid, which is integrated with the existing diesel-generation capacity and managed by a Tesla Microgrid Controller, has been supplying the island community of some 350 permanent residents, and its dormant-during-Covid-19 tourist facilities, which typically host 16,000 visitors each year.
Its successful operation was celebrated by Photon Energy Group headquarters in Amsterdam in an announcement on Friday.
“The experience we have gained through the delivery of the project demonstrates that solar power and energy storage not only reduce emissions and other environmental risks but are instrumental in ensuring energy security,” said Michael Gartner, Managing Director of Photon Energy Australia, and Co-founder of Photon Energy Group.
In August, the Dutch developer had cited grid-connection delays at two solar farms near Leeton, in New South Wales as part of the reason for an AUD 1.4 million (US$1.0 million) loss in the second quarter of this year, compared to earnings of AUD 1.5 million in Q1.
This island microgrid, although it posed unique challenges, was at least free of the tyranny of National Electricity Market connection travails.
Lord Howe Island’s community, isolated some 700 kilometers north east of Sydney in the Pacific Ocean, has long relied on shipments of diesel every two to three weeks for its energy needs.
The shipments themselves posed a risk to the island’s coastal environment and its coral reef, which is the world’s southernmost reef formation; and reliance on diesel also exposed the community to fluctuations in global fuel prices and threats to its energy security.
A statement from Photon Energy says that since the system was installed, it has at times provided the island with renewable energy “for stretches of up to five consecutive days and nights in August without any diesel-generated power”, showing the reliability of solar-plus-battery technology, “even during the less sunny winter months”.
Partly funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which contributed AUD 4.5 million (US$3.2 million), the AUD 1.1 million project also secured a loan of AUD 5.9 million from the New South Wales Government and provided the balance of funds from its own capital.
The business case for the renewable energy project was first developed in 2014 by the Lord Howe Island Board, the statutory authority that manages the island.
Its plan originally included wind turbines as part of the hybrid mix, but a Lord Howe Island Lessons Learnt Report, published by ARENA in late 2019, said the wind component could not be delivered. Further feasibility studies were undertaken since 2017 and “identified that a reconfigured and resized solar PV and battery storage generator would provide the same benefits”.
Photon Energy won the tender for engineering, procurement and construction of the project in 2019, and implemented a value-management consultation process between the clients and its design and management teams — a thought-provoking step it has found beneficial in all its projects, which have so far racked up a combined global solar-generation capacity of 110 MWp.
On Lord Howe Island, the process “resulted in substantial cost savings”, and “an increase of 8% to the size of the PV component and 14% to the battery component”, as well as permanent public toilet facilities at the site which is passed by tourists on one of the island’s many stunning scenic walks.
The Lessons Learnt Report concluded that, “Allowing a short period within the project timeframe for a value-management dialogue can result in a project delivering more ‘wins’ for the community and within the scope tolerance of the project.”
Given the island’s reliance on diesel for its electricity, it was also critical that the integration of solar and battery storage be seamless and maintain an uninterrupted supply.
The remote location of the island, often inclement weather conditions and the site of the power plant posed access, design and geotechnical challenges for the contractors. In addition, says the Photon Energy Group website, the project “required a great deal of adaptability and problem-solving due to complications resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic”.
Despite such difficulties, Photon Energy Engineering Australia successfully negotiated the constraints of this environmentally sensitive site and the project, commenced in February 2020, was completed in 14 months.
Mick Pettit, Acting CEO of the Lord Howe Island Board said on Friday, “The announcement of this project is a fantastic result for the Lord Howe Island community and visitors alike.” He added that improving the island’s energy security, along with reducing the environmental impact of its electricity supply, “without detracting from the World Heritage values of Lord Howe Island, is a result that everyone should celebrate”.
