The selected renewable energy producers must have the status of a qualified producer issued by the Regulatory Commission for Energy in FBiH (FERK) and operate facilities connected to EBiH's power grid. The utility set BAM 0.25 ($0.13) as the cap price for each kilowatt-hour it will buy from the selected power plants.
EBiH is currently developing two solar plants totaling 50 MW on a coal waste site in the municipality of Gračanica, as well as other PV plants at its Breza, Kakanj and Kreka coal mines and other unspecified locations. Its solar portfolio currently stands at 230 MW. In May 2021, it launched a call to acquire operational renewable energy projects exceeding 1 MW in size.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Bosnia-Herzegovina had just 53 MW of solar connected to the grid by the end of 2021. In May, Bosnia's Foreign Investment Promotion Agency revealed that Norwegian developer Greenstat had started working on a 45 MW solar plant in the country.

The nanoparticle technology directly uses the electrical charges created by sunlight to generate hydrogen when the sun is shining. The prototype can also power the catalyst and membrane integration assembly with renewable grid electricity. The prototype design integrates the company’s proprietary catalysts, light absorbers, and membrane integration assembly. The panel housing deploys modular materials that are easily scalable for mass manufacturing. SunHydrogen said that the design allows for efficient use of sunlight to maximize hydrogen production during the day, with minimal water consumption.
Lhyfe has ordered 10 of Plug Power's 5 MW proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer systems. It is reportedly the most significant electrolyzer order placed by a French company. “With these electrolyzers of a total capacity of 50 MW (equivalent to up to 20 tons per day), Lhyfe aims to produce a renewable green hydrogen using primarily wind and solar-power for various mobility applications in Europe, including forklifts and light commercial vehicles, such as the Master Van from Hyvia, Plug’s joint venture with Renault, with hydrogen deliveries as early as 2023,” wrote the French hydrogen company. Lhyfe also launched its UK operations, joining its subsidiaries in Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Spain. “The speed with which this deployment is taking place confirms the growing enthusiasm of European countries for renewable hydrogen,” said Matthieu Guesné, CEO of Lhyfe. The company will inaugurate the world’s first offshore hydrogen production demonstrator in Saint-Nazaire later this month. 
Chinese Academy of Sciences researchers have claimed in a new study that Rhodium nanocrystals on porous graphdiyne show unmatched electrocatalytic performance and highly stable saline water electrolysis. They reported a route to synthesize well-defined Rhodium (Rh) nanocrystals in an aqueous solution using formic acid as a reduction agent and porous graphdiyne (GDY) as the stabilizing support. High-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning-transmission electron microscopy images show the high-density atomic steps on the faces of hexahedral Rh nanocrystals. The paper, published in Nature Communications, suggests that sp–C~Rh bonds can stabilize Rh nanocrystals. “Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the stepped surface and special interactions form between GDY and Rh endow the catalyst with excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for large current density H2 production from alkaline simulated seawater (saline water),” the scientists said. “For example, the Rh/GDY can deliver 1000 mA cm−2 at a very small overpotential of 65 mV vs. RHE, which is better than the reported electrocatalysts, and commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst.”
Ballard Power has announced a fuel cell module order from Medha Servo Drives, a rail system integrator that has been contracted by Indian Railways to develop India’s first hydrogen-powered trains.
Air Liquide and Faurecia have completed a technological and economic feasibility study for long-distance heavy-duty vehicles. “Currently in the prototyping phase, the product is set to hit the market in 2027,” said Air Liquide. The partnership between the two French companies dates back to October 2021.
Zero Emission Industries announced the first close of its Series A funding round. “The round is led by Chevron New Energies with additional investment from U.S.-based shipping and logistics company Crowley,” said the maritime hydrogen tech company.
Energy European Commissioner Kadri Simson participated in the first EU-India Green Hydrogen Forum this week.“We want to develop plans for cooperation on green hydrogen together in the next few months,” Simson said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/09/improving-n-type-topcon-solar-cells/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2022",Improving n-type TOPCon solar cells,"This year, the silicon PV manufacturing industry has begun to shift toward n-type technologies, largely due to their potential for higher performance compared to today’s mainstream p-type PERC cells. A few different n-type technologies exist, but manufacturers already operating large capacities for older technology widely consider TOPCon the best option, as it allows them to upgrade existing production lines, while other routes would require big investment in all new factory equipment.
These manufacturers will be keen to look at ways to keep improving the performance of their TOPCon cells, and as both researchers and industry gain more experience with this technology, new pathways will likely emerge for tweaks to the cell design and processing that can push for higher efficiencies. Scientists in South Korea provided one example of this with a recent investigation into thermal annealing processes and their impact on the quality of the cell passivation layers.
The group, led by the Korea Institute of Energy Research, Daejeon, fabricated TOPCon cells in two groups with different barrier layer thicknesses, and subjected these to thermal annealing for 30 minutes at a range of temperatures between 750 C and 1,000 C. They then measured various electrical and optical characteristics of the cells to draw conclusions on the various processes.
They described these measurements in “Thermal annealing effects on tunnel oxide passivated hole contacts for high-efficiency crystalline silicon solar cells,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports. They found that the thicker barrier provided better passivation quality, and that diffusion of the boron dopant in the silicon during the thermal annealing posed the biggest threats to passivation quality and therefore cell performance – which help future research know where to focus.
“Our studies reveal that the structural stability of the tunnel oxide and the p–n junction formed across the tunnel oxide are essential to improve the passivation properties,” the group explained. “These findings offer useful information to understand the formation mechanism of hole-selective contacts under thermal annealing and may have potential implications in the designing of crystalline silicon solar cells with high-conversion efficiency.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/09/solar-industry-braces-for-impact-of-inner-mongolias-shift-on-power-prices/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,ASIA,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2022",Solar industry braces for impact of Inner Mongolia’s shift on power prices,"The Chinese authorities announced a sudden shift in energy policy for the Inner Mongolia region on Aug. 30, when the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) decided to terminate discounted power prices, effective immediately. It marked a sharp departure from earlier plans to attract investment in “strategic emerging industries” in the relatively underdeveloped region.
Inner Mongolia has rich power resources and has already attracted a lot of solar investment, especially from upstream players. Its polysilicon output ranks second in China. According to the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association (CNMIA), Inner Mongolia's polysilicon capacity reached 74,000 metric tons (MTs) at the end of 2021. It said that is set to grow to 320,000 MTs and 522,000 MTs by the end of 2022 and 2023, respectively.
In 2021, annual polysilicon output in the region hit 66,000 MTs, accounting for 13.2% of China’s total. This figure is expected to reach 358,000 MTs in 2023, representing an estimated 24.5% of the nation's total projected polysilicon output at that time.  
Most major solar companies – including Longi, Tongwei, GCL, Daqo, TBEA, East Hope, Zhonghuan, JA Solar, Trina Solar, Canadian Solar, Risen, Shangji, and Shuangliang – have invested in Inner Mongolia due to its discounted power prices. In the past two years alone, total PV investment in the region has surpassed CNY 200 billion ($28.1 billion).
The government later said the termination of discounted power prices would have “very little” impact on companies in Inner Mongolia. However, the cost impact on the PV industry chain is obvious and significant. Research indicates that the discounted electric power price was around CNY 0.25/kWh to CNY 0.31/kWh prior to September. This month it has risen to CNY 0.45/kWh.  
Jessica Jin, a renewable energy analyst for IHS Markit, told pv magazine that under the new policy, wafer costs will increase to between CNY 0.008/W and CNY 0.010/W. She said that non-silicon costs will rise by 6% to 8%, while the cost of polysilicon production will also rise by 12% to 15%. The anticipated impact can be attributed to the fact that power costs account for about 15% of wafer production costs and around 35% of the cost of producing polysilicon.
Longi and Zhonghuan have since told Chinese media outlets that they are carefully evaluating the potential impact of the policy shift. However, this is not the first time that a Chinese region or province has radically changed its power price policy.
In April, the authorities in hydropower-rich Yunnan province announced the termination of power price discounts. In June, Longi responded by suspending several ingot and wafer projects in the province. In July, the company also sharply ramped up plans for new ingot and wafer capacity in Inner Mongolia. But now, the new pricing policy in the region has cast a shadow on its plans.
Regional governments in China offer preferential pricing policies to attract investment. However, policy uncertainty can often have a negative impact on investor sentiment.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has published research detailing multiple grid events that produced solar power outages across a region. One pattern that has arisen is that a grid asset abnormality occurs, like power plants tripping or fires causing shorts. Solar assets react by lowering output for a short to medium amounts of time, versus ‘riding through’ these events.
A West Texas event earned NERC analysis after a single-line-to-ground fault on a generator step-up transformer at a combined-cycle power plant led to a reduction of 1,178 MW of solar PV resources – up to 200 miles away. NERC later released Multiple Solar PV Disturbances in CAISO, which described why more than 100 utility-scale solar plants, and a significant amount of distributed solar, shed gigawatts of capacity during grid fault events in the spring and summer of 2021.
NERC has now released an analysis of the Blue Cut and Canyon 2 Fire disturbances in August 2016 and October 2017. The report is a product of ongoing work by the Inverter-Based Resource Performance Task Force.
The report notes that the Blue Cut Fire caused a 500 kV line fault and led to a temporary loss of 1,178 MW of solar. NERC said inverters were tripping erroneously on instantaneous frequency measurements, and that most of the units quickly ceased injecting energy into the system when voltage measurements fell outside of a standard range.
The Canyon 2 fire caused “phase-to-phase” faults on 220 kV and 500 kV transmission lines. These events caused the reduction of solar output “across a wide region of the Southern California Edison footprint.”
It was suggested that the main issue of the Blue Cut Fire (inverters tripping on calculated frequencies) was mitigated at Canyon 2. However, a list of additional challenges were noted:
NERC also suggested that “transient interactions between momentary cessation, transient overvoltage, and in-plant shunt compensation” will warrant further investigation. Prior reports have suggested that many inverter problems could be solved by correcting settings or performing basic updates.

PV Hardware (PVH) ranks among the largest solar tracker providers in the world, with nearly 10% of global market share. The company has manufacturing facilities in Spain and Saudi Arabia, and has been a market leader in European and Middle East markets since 2018. Now, it is set to make a splash in the US market, as it has announced plans to build a facility to manufacture its products in Texas.
The company said it expects the 6 GW factory to be operational by June 2023. It said most companies sign sourcing agreements with a wide set of providers, but it operates differently. The company said it controls every aspect of its product, from buying its own steel, sourcing electronics to building its own controllers, making its own rivets, owning its robotics, and paying for in-house PVH labor. The site will be the company’s third wholly owned factory in the world.
“The solar industry is one of the most challenging in terms of execution times. We are building bigger plants than ever in a shorter period of time, it is an impossible task if it’s not well supported by suppliers,” aid Hitesh Patel, head of solar PV for KSA. “Thanks to PVH, we are able to received the material in the shortest time imaginable and start construction on schedule despite challenging market dynamics and supply chain disruptions. A dedicated manufacturing line is essential for short and timely deliveries.”
PVH has operated in the United States since it was established in California in 2011. The company has supplied more than 2.5 GW at 36 solar projects across the country. Its new factory is the latest in a wave of clean-tech manufacturing developments since the passage of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA incentives include:
Across the solar supply chain, the IRA includes the following credits:
“With long-term incentives for clean energy deployment and manufacturing, the solar and storage industry is ready to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and get to work building out the next era of American energy leadership,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, the president of the Solar Energy Industries Association.

They have developed a methodology to predict power production from vessel-integrated PV systems.
“Vessel-integrated solar is already commercially viable,” the research's corresponding author, Hesan Ziar, told pv magazine. “A few companies are already trying to integrate PV modules onto the hold of the barges. According to our simulation, based on real characteristics and movement data of the Dutch inland shipping fleet, the specific annual PV energy yield for a container vessel is 857 Wh per Wp, and for a bulk vessel, is 843 Wh per Wp. These numbers are comparable with a rooftop PV system in the Netherlands which is around 950 Wh per Wp.”
Using a MATLAB-based simulation framework, the scientists developed a way to simulate the PV power production of vehicle-integrated PV systems in vessels.
“There are a couple of advantages of general cargo vessels that make them suitable for the implementation of PV modules. These ships have little equipment installed on top of their deck and have a relatively large surface area that is only used to store goods, the hold, which can be smartly integrated with PV modules. Above this hold, PV modules can be integrated,” Ziar explained. “Since electric vessels have batteries on board, one can envision a fleet of urban vessels as a fleet of small PV power plants that supply power to the electrical grid whenever needed. Decentralized energy production will also lower power losses due to less transmission.”
The Dutch group tested the simulation methodology on a small vessel relying on a 48 V/800 Ah battery system, a 22 kW electrical motor, and a 360 MW half-cut PERC module provided by Chinese manufacturer Longi.
“The module was installed on a structure that enabled various tilts,” the scientists explained. “The mast of the vessel has been lowered during the entire experiment, to prevent shadows on the PV module. The PV module is connected to an EPsolar Tracer 415BN 12/24V 40A charger controller, which uses maximum power point tracking (MPPT).”
They validated the model during two weeks of testing and found that the proposed methodology overestimated the PV power by 4%, with a 95% confidence interval between 0.87 and 1.05.
“Our results showed that 7.18% and 5.78% of the energy demand of container and bulk vessels respectively can be supplied by implementing PV modules on general cargo vessels,” they said.
The research team presented its findings in “Photovoltaic Potential of the Dutch Inland Shipping Fleet: An Experimentally Validated Method to Simulate the Power Series from Vessel Integrated Photovoltaics,” which was recently published in RRL Solar.
“As the largest European fleet, the Dutch inland shipping industry aims to be climate neutral and emission-free by 2050,” Ziar said. “To meet this goal, the propulsion of the inland shipping vessels needs to change from diesel-powered to electric-powered.”

Energy-as-a-service specialist Sunnova Energy has revealed that it has filed an application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to develop a novel solution: a “micro-utility.”
The company seeks to develop largely self-sustaining micro utilities by equipping new home communities with solar and storage. Newly constructed homes will be the focus, so Sunnova can work closely with developers to design and implement distributed solar microgrids backed with resilient energy storage.
“Sunnova is breaking new ground by expanding its distributed energy service platform from homes to whole communities. We see a future where communities, neighborhoods, and businesses can operate independently from the legacy grid with sustainable energy sources that provide uninterrupted power,” William J Berger, the founder and CEO of Sunnova. “We believe microgrids address a strong need in the market for more robust energy solutions and better connectivity. The Sunnova Adaptive Community will provide consumers with the ability to produce, share, and deliver power when it’s needed most.”
The company has tajken formal steps before the CPUC to qualify as a “micro-utility” and to request a certificate to construct and operate microgrids under Section 2780 and Section 1001 of the California Public Utilities Code.
“SCMC’s application highlights the relief that the existing transmission and distribution system will experience given that most of the power that will be consumed by these communities will be generated locally from renewable resources,” said Berger. “We hope the CPUC moves expeditiously to approve our application so that we can begin serving new communities.”
In its 2021-22 transmission plan, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) has announced 23 transmission projects at an estimated cost of $2.9 billion. A significant portion of these costs could be avoided if California instead pivoted to a decentralized model of energy.
In a report by the University of Otago in New Zealand, researchers took a demand-driven approach. They analyzed a per-minute resolution time series of individual household demand over several neighborhoods that contained distributed solar and energy storage.
They found that the collective use of batteries had dramatic effects on both load smoothing and peak demand shaving. Aggregation of smart storage led to a reduction in per-house battery requirements by 50% for load-smoothing needs and by 90% for peak shaving.
As an example, if peak shaving occurred for demand above 3 kW per house, deploying batteries individually for 20 houses would require 120 kWh of storage. By contrast, deploying batteries collectively would only require 7 kWh, the researchers said. Sharing batteries or having one battery per 20 houses would be a less expensive approach to providing these services, they said.
The researchers said the results make a case for coordinated battery deployment at the street or building level for multiple economic benefits. These benefits include the potential reduction in energy storage cost for homeowners (who could buy a smaller unit), benefits to the grid in easing demand and load related strains, and benefits to solar developers who can add another value chain to their operations by facilitating these grid services.

The global MLPE market grew by 33% between 2021 and 2019, when around 9,000 MW of MLPE were shipped throughout the world.
IHS Markit said it expects cumulative MLPE shipments to reach almost 100 GW by 2026, with the United States, Germany and the Netherlands emerging as the top three markets. The report shows that one of the drivers for rising MLPE demand is the booming distributed-generation market, which is expected to account for almost 43% of global PV installations between 2022 and 2025.
“While the booming distributed-generation segment is definitely one of the drivers for high MLPE demand, markets that are less price sensitive and have mandatory rapid shutdown requirements or advanced grid requirements tend to be key markets for MLPE compared with markets where price is a more dominating factor,” Cormac Gilligan, director of IHS Markit, told pv magazine.
Strong demand from the distributed-generation segment is expected to drive MLPE prices down in the next few years.
“Also, as suppliers enter new geographies, prices are forecast to decline in order to obtain market shares,” said Gilligan. “However, the price declines are expected to be slower in 2022 and 2023 comparing with the following years due to the higher cost inputs owing to semiconductor and electronic component supply challenges.”
The United States was the largest MLPE market in 2021, representing around 44% of global shipments. The country was the first to introduce module-level rooftop rapid shutdown requirements, followed by the Philippines. Other major PV markets such as China are reportedly also considering adopting such requirements.
MLPE is also becoming more common in areas where there are no rapid shutdown requirements.
“In recent years, the United States’ dominance in the MLPE market has been challenged by certain markets in Europe such as Netherlands and Germany, in South America such as Brazil and in Asia such as Australia,” the report said. “While consumers are not obliged to adopt these technologies, they have been persuaded by other benefits such as optimized yield, enhanced monitoring capabilities, and in certain cases, easier installation.”

They claim it would be able to largely cover a building's cooling and heating demand with geothermal heat pumps and solar energy.
They usedphotovoltaic-thermal (PVT) panels to directly cover the heat demand via their high-temperature heat production and provide low-temperature heat to the heat pump at moments with low solar irradiation. This leads to a smaller temperature lift and thus to a significant improvement of the coefficient of performance (COP).
The multi-source heat pump receives heat from either ambient air or water, with the selection based on maximum performance.
“The system includes standard (low-cost) water tanks that are charged by both the heat pump and the collectors and supply the demand,” the researchers said. “This operational flexibility decouples the production with consumption up to some extent.”
For heating production, the system also uses a condenser that is always coupled with a buffer tank that stores the hot water at a maximum temperature of 45 C. The water is then sent to the space heating circuit during winter. The tank can be also charged by the PVT module at hours of high solar radiation.
“Otherwise, the collectors charge the solar buffer tank, enabling the solar-assistance mode of the heat pump by providing heat to its evaporator,” the scientists explained.
In the heating mode, during high solar radiation, the PVT panels charge the space buffer tank, which is used for space heating. In low radiation, the heat is stored in a buffer water tank and is used to supply heat to the evaporator of the heat pump.
“During the night, the heat pump can be still supplied by the solar buffer tank if its temperature is more than 10 C and higher than the ground temperature,” the scientists said. “In any case, if the ground has a higher temperature than the solar buffer tank, the ground source is preferred, which has a much smaller sensitivity to temperature fluctuations.”
The academics said that the proposed system configuration, depending on the latitude and environmental conditions, could be successfully implemented in several European countries.
“Such layout is promising for office buildings in diverse climatic regions in Europe, revealing that it is possible to reach a 75% renewable share on an annual basis in south Europe for buildings with a moderate energy-efficiency level, and even 80% for new buildings, when also considering the electricity consumption of the building itself,” they said. “This share is reduced to 50% to 60% in Copenhagen, due to the lower solar potential during the winter months.”
They presented their findings in t”Towards a 100% renewable energy share for heating and cooling in office buildings with solar and geothermal energy,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Advances.
“The next steps of this work will focus on the electricity self-consumption, to minimize the energy exchange with the grid and thus enhance the system's cost-effectiveness and on the implementation of a small-scale pilot system for long-term testing under both residential and office building profiles to verify the concept at real conditions,” they said.
