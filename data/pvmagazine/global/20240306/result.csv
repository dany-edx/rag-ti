The funds, which will be granted no later than Dec. 31, 2025, will take the form of direct grants. They will be fully financed through the European Commission’s Recovery and Resilience Facility.
Companies in Portugal that produce solar panels, wind turbines, heat-pumps, electrolyzers and equipment for carbon capture usage and storage will all be eligible for funding, as well as companies involved in the extraction of critical raw materials needed for their production.
The grant was approved under the EU State aid Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework, which supports measures in sectors seen as key to accelerating the green transition and reducing fuel dependencies.
A recent statement from the European Commission said that the funding “is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to accelerate the green transition and facilitate the development of certain economic activities” in Portugal.
Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of competition policy at the European Commission, said that the funding “will provide key support to the production of strategic equipment needed for the transition towards a net-zero economy … The scheme will support these investments without unduly disturbing competition.”
According to figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency, Portugal had deployed 2,536 MW of solar by the end of 2022.
The Portuguese government has set a target for 85% of its electricity to come from renewables by the end of the decade. The country was solely powered by renewables for one weekend in November 2023. In February 2024, the nation's second solar-wind hybrid project was commissioned.

The deal will see Ferroglobe supply quartzite and metallurgical grade silicon (MGS) to Longi, in order to support the Chinese solar module manufacturer's strategy to expand purchases from the leading Western suppliers of silicon materials.
A joint statement said the partnership, which has been in effect since the start of the year, “reflects the two companies' shared commitment in their respective fields to operational excellence and traceability ranging from quartz to solar panels.”
Tian Ye, Longi’s vice president said “this strategic move will enable us to supply our trusted customers and partners with Longi's dependable, high-efficiency and eco-friendly solar products worldwide.”
London-based Ferroglobe PLC is a global producer of both silicon metal. It accounts for 14% of global production capacity. According to its website, it has 23 production centers on four continents and 62 furnaces. It claims to be the leading producer of ferroalloys in the European Union, with a capacity exceeding 1 million tons per year.
In October 2023, the company announced the acquisition of a high-purity quartz mine in South Carolina, as part of its long-term strategy to become fully self-sufficient in quartz, which is a critical raw material in the production of silicon metal.

2,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/06/solarpower-europe-to-support-european-pv-industry-says-no-to-import-duties/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",SANDRA ENKHARDT,2024-03-06,"EU to support European PV industry, says no to import duties","Around 400 participants were at the recent SolarPower Europe Summit 2024 event when SolarPower Europe President Aristotelis Chantavas and the vice president of the EU Commission, Maros Sevcofic, officially launched the Mission Solar initiative in Brussels.
Walburga Hemetsberger, the CEO of SolarPower Europe, answered questions from politicians for around two hours. In recent years, the solar industry has achieved a certain level of importance in Brussels, as it represents the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in Europe.
New PV installations in the European Union hit 56 GW in 2023, as EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson explained on the second day of the event, which she attended for the third time this year – perhaps because new elections in the EU will be held in the fall. Simson said the solar industry has a “good story to tell,” with the growth of PV in the European Union doubling within two years. Due to expansion, 15 million cubic meters of gas imports from Russia could be saved. In addition, around 650,000 people are now employed in the solar industry in Europe. 
“I'm amazed at how much has changed,” Simson said, looking back on her first appearance three years ago. The rapid growth is partly due to EU measures such as the solar energy strategy and the REPower plan, which adjusted the framework conditions and, above all, accelerated approvals for new projects, said Simson.
However, PV manufacturers are being left out in the cold, as they are exposed to “unfair competition” from Chinese competitors. Quick help from Brussels is still not in sight, but Simson said that the European Union has done its homework. Among other things, she alluded to an agreement of EU entities on the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA). Now it is up to the member states to implement the regulations. The NZIA provides for a quota of 40% for domestic energy transition technologies to meet demand, including PV, said Simson.
However, it is also about finding a balance. Europe must maintain the pace of growth while also supporting manufacturers. There is still capacity to produce modules in Europe, but it remains to be seen how long existing manufacturers will stay active in the market under the current situation.
Armin Froitzheim, the CTO of Solarwatt, said that the company laid off 84 employees in February.
“And we will have to lay off more people if measures are not taken quickly,” Froitzheim added. “We are waiting for the resilience bonus for roof systems in Germany. But it keeps getting postponed.” 
The European Commission also recognizes the need to create a certain level of resilience along the PV value chain. But the European Union's measures against the Chinese industry appear to be too weak, especially with the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). There are many adjustments that need to be made in order to create a level playing field for European manufacturers.
Simson also discussed data, cybersecurity, and the Ecodesign Directive. But what PV manufacturers really need in order to survive and massively expand capacity are opex and capex subsidies, as the United States is currently demonstrating, as these incentives are attracting European manufacturers to the US market.
Sevcofic also promoted the introduction of resilience auctions in the member states at Solarpower Europe Summit 2024. The criteria will have to be “rebalanced,” he said. Criteria such as CO2 footprints, human rights, and sustainability should count more than just the price, he said.
Simson noted that she sent letters to all responsible officials ahead of the meeting of EU energy ministers. She said it outlined potential measures to improve the framework conditions for PV manufacturers without restricting growth.
“We agree that we need a targeted response that helps EU manufacturers without affecting the rest of the market. With this in mind, we want to promote high-quality products that meet high environmental and labor standards,” said Simson. “We want to concentrate on innovative technologies such as building-integrated photovoltaics or agri-PV.”
There is an agreement that there will be no import duties.

3,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/06/battery-heavyweights-reaffirm-commitment-to-solid-state-technology/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,2024-03-06,Battery heavyweights reaffirm commitment to solid-state technology,"As lithium-ion batteries continue to improve in terms of both performance and cost, it is becoming increasingly difficult for alternative technologies to challenge the incumbent. However, interest in solid-state batteries, which promise better energy density and safety, has not waned, judging by recent announcements.
South Korea’s Samsung SDI is moving toward mass production of its all-solid-state battery technology with an energy density of 900 Wh/L. This week, the company is unveiling a technology roadmap at the InterBattery show in Seoul.
The document will demonstrate that every aspect of its plan for mass producing all solid-state batteries in 2027 is well on track, from development production line project launch to supply chain management, Samsung SDI said in a statement.
In December 2023, Samsung SDI established a dedicated team to promote the commercialization of its all solid-state business. Previously, it set up a pilot in its R&D Center in Suwon last year and is currently delivering proto samples.
“Our preparations for mass-producing next-generation products of various form factors such as all solid-state battery are well underway,” said Samsung SDI President and CEO Yoon-ho Choi.
Like CATL, BYD and Toyota, Samsung’s solid-state technology is based on sulfide-based solid electrolytes, which have the highest lithium ion conductivity compared to other solid state electrolytes. All solid-state batteries developed by Samsung SDI stand out for their anode-less configuration which is said to offer improved performance compared to devices featuring lithium metal anode and solid electrolyte.
Samsung’s roadmap release comes hot off the heals of the announcement of a Chinese national alliance of automakers and battery giants, including BYD, CATL, and Nio, aimed at developing all solid-state batteries.
In a bid to build a supply chain for solid-state batteries by 2030, Beijing in January set up a consortium, the China All-Solid-State Battery Collaborative Innovation Platform (CASIP), which brings together government, academia, and industry.
China already dominates the global battery market and looks determined to stay on top by boosting research and development of next-gen battery technologies, such as solid-state batteries which are particularly suited for electric mobility applications.
Among automakers, Japanese Toyota Motors has taken the lead with more the 1,000 solid-state battery patents. Last month, it said that it is preparing to mass-produce solid-state batteries by 2027 or 2028.
Nissan and Honda have previously revealed plans to establish solid-state battery manufacturing lines in-house. Meanwhile, Western automakers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, BMW, and Ford are also exploring solid-state batteries through partnerships with startups.
However, the production of solid-state batteries at scale is still held back by technological challenges and high costs, with industry analysts warning of a relatively tough path toward mass production in the coming years.

The amendments are designed to adapt the WEEE Directive to a 2022 ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union on the partial invalidity of the directive itself. This was due to the retroactive application of extended producer responsibility to waste solar panels placed on the market between Aug. 13, 2005, and Aug. 13, 2012.
The amendments state that the costs of management and disposal of waste solar panels marketed after Aug. 13, 2012, correspond to the producer of the electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). The expanded producer responsibility for EEE that was added to the scope of the directive in 2018 should apply to electronic products placed on the market after that date.
The amendments also introduce a review clause under which the European Commission must assess the need to review the directive by no later than 2026. The European Commission adopted its proposal for specific amendments to the WEEE Directive on Feb. 7, 2023. In November 2023, the co-legislators reached a provisional political agreement after adopting negotiating positions in June and October 2023. The European Parliament formally voted on the agreement on Feb. 6, 2024.
The latest European Council vote closes the adoption procedure. The text of the amendments will now be signed by the co-legislators. It will then be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and will go into force 20 days later. Member states will have up to 18 months to transpose the amended directive into their national legal systems.

STS, a subsidiary of renewable services provider Kumpulan Gading Kencana Sdn Bhd, will use the financing from Bank Islam to cover the solar farm's capital expenses, including the refinancing of the land and development costs.
The solar installation in Bidor, Perak, Malaysia, will supply electricity to Tenaga Nasional Bhd under the New Enhanced Dispatch Arrangement (NEDA) mechanism.
The NEDA is an initiative under Malaysia’s Energy Commission that allows merchant generators to participate and sell energy on the single buyer market, in order to enhance competition and lower electricity prices.
With the signing of the agreement, Bank Islam has become the first Islamic banking institution to provide financing to private companies under the NEDA.
“This financing will aid in Malaysia's energy transition, from power generation based on fossil fuel and coal to renewable energy sources like solar power, thus promoting the adoption of eco-friendly solutions while bolstering the economy for a more prosperous and resilient future,” said Bank Islam Group Chief Executive Officer Dato’ Mohd Muazzam Mohamed.
Malaysia has set a target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The country had deployed 1,933 MW of solar by the end of 2022, according to figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency.

France-based pergola manufacturer Heolian has developed a new solar carport solution for residential applications.
The company has been offering its new Atrium Electron carport since January. “As designers of pergolas, carports and lightweight roofs, we wanted to add photovoltaic design skills to offer a complete product, without our customers needing to look elsewhere,” Julien Brosse, the company's CEO and the product designer, told pv magazine France.
Patented in mid-December 2023, the carport consists of a structure, either self-supporting or attached to the building, made of aluminum extruded in France and 100% recyclable. Depending on the configuration chosen, the system can have four or six posts each measuring 120 mm x 120 mm, supporting 8 to 20 photovoltaic panels. The carport is also equipped with rainwater drainage.
According to the manufacturer, its installation does not require structural work and a simple declaration of work is sufficient if the surface area is less than 20 m². The assembly process has two phases: the carpentry with the assembly of the photovoltaic panels on the aluminum structure and the electrical connections. “The electrician intervenes with a quick connection,” said Brosse. “There are no screws, just a cover system with spring effects to allow it to access the MC4 cable extensions and the 220 V garland. Without any crimping to be done on-site.”
The system is equipped with 21.8%-efficient 425 W bifacial modules produced by French manufacturer Duoenergy and microinverters. The panels feature TOPCon technology and have a size of 1,722 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm.
Affordable at around €1,000 ($1,087) per m2, the Atrium Electron carport can also be equipped with an electric vehicle power charging station.

Longi has introduced its new Hi-MO X6 Guardian C&I module at Sydney’s Smart Energy Conference.
The module for the the Australian market allows water to run freely off its surface, so dusty residue does not build up around the edges where the frame meets the glass. However, the module still has traditional framing on its longer sides, so the modules must be mounted on a vertical axis, rather than horizontally.
The module uses back contact (BC) technology, which Longi fully transitioned its Australian ranges to in 2023. BC technology has advantages for panel efficiencies, as it reduces shading losses.
The Guardian module’s maximum power output is 590 W. It is big and particularly long, measuring 2,281 mm x 1,134 mm, and weighing in at 27.2 kg.
The company plans to launch a residential module with the same self-cleaning frame concept in the third quarter or fourth quarter of this year, with dimensions of about 1,722 mm x 1,134 mm.
In terms of cost, the company said the Hi-MO X6 Guardian comes in around AUD 0.30 ($0.20)/watt.
The March edition of pv magazine, out Monday, is dedicated to energy storage and considers sodium-ion’s chances of toppling lithium-ion, takes a look at compressed air technology, and asks whether big or small is the best approach for African solar and storage.
Later this month, Longi will also launch a new Ultra Black module to the residential Australian market, with a power output of 440 W. One of the Ultra Black panel’s features is that it is fingerprint-proof, making it easier for installers to handle without marking. Representatives for the company said this does not extend to fingertips covered in sunscreen or zinc, however.
Longi is not the only company in the Australian market with an anti-dust module based on a  lowered frame design. DAH Solar has been supplying its Full Screen module in the country since October 2023 through wholesaler Austra Energy. The DAH Full Screen module has all edges of its frame lowered to prevent the accumulation of dust and water.

Badger Hollow Solar Park in southwestern Wisconsin is providing renewable energy to power Molson Coors’ operations in the US state.
The 300 MW solar installation, developed by Invenergy, is the largest in Wisconsin and generates enough electricity to power the equivalent of 90,000 homes.
The Badger Hollow solar installation is co-located with hog farming operations. The project provides tax revenue from the shared leasing of the facility on farmland.
The project was developed in two 150 MW stages. The first phase came online in December 2021 and the second stage came online in January 2024. The solar park is built on 1,100 acres features a total of 830,000 bifacial solar modules on trackers.
Wisconsin Public Service owns 100 MW of the first phase, with Madison Gas and Electric (MGE) owning 50 MW of that project. MGE and We Energies, a local utility, jointly own the second phase.
“The completion of Badger Hollow is another step in our ongoing transition to greater use of cost-effective, carbon-free, renewable energy to serve all MGE electric customers,” said Jeff Keebler, MGE chairman, president and CEO. “By 2030, we expect every MGE electric customer will have 80% fewer carbon emissions from their electricity use simply by being an MGE customer as we work toward our goal of net-zero carbon electricity.”
Molson Coors is taking part in We Energies’ Energy for Tomorrow subscription program that allows companies, local governments and other users buy a share of the energy produced the facility. The program offers renewable energy certificates for energy from the facility. The company purchases electricity for its Leinenkugel’s brewery in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin under an agreement with Xcel Energy.

“Our customers wanted equipment to characterize and evaluate different PV cell technologies. We developed the Lightbox to meet their needs as no equivalent product was available,” Lightricity Managing Director Matthias Kauer told pv magazine.
Available in two sizes, LightBox 1.0 and LightBox XL, are measurement systems that emulate indoor lighting environments based on white light emitting diode (LED) technology. They differ in size but share functionality, such as current-voltage (IV) and power-voltage curve acquisition, closed-looped illuminance control via 4 lux sensors, temperature monitoring at up to three different points, and connectivity to computers and source meters such as instruments from Keithley or Keysight, according to Lightricity.
The tests supported include short-circuit current, open circuit voltage, maximum power point power, maximum power point voltage and maximum power point current, as well as fill factor, shunt and series resistance.
Both units have correlated color temperature (CCT) ranges from 2,500 K to 6,000 K with a default of 3000 K, and color rendering index (CRI) is from 70 to 90 with a default of 70.
Light intensities of < 200 lux can be reached with an included diffuser. Light uniformity is ~ 95%, and the manufacturer notes it was tested for both units at the U.K. National Physical Laboratory as part of an Innovate UK collaboration.
LightBox 1.0 measures 110 mm × 110 mm × 80 mm and has a 5 × 5 array of white LED light with a maximum sample size of 5 cm × 5 cm. Its light illuminance range is 20 lux to 50,000 lux.
The LightBox XL measures 185 mm × 185 mm × 85 mm and has an 11 × 11 array of white LED light with a maximum sample size of 10 cm x 12 cm. Its illuminance range is 50 lux to 40,000 lux.
The Lightbox equipment is available directly from Lightricity. It is designed and manufactured in the United Kingdom.
Customers include indoor PV cell manufacturers, as well as original equipment manufacturers that use PV cells to power their products, such as wristwatches, wearable devices, IoT and sensors, according to Kauer. Research labs investigating the properties and performance of advanced PV devices are also customers. 
“We have sold Lightboxes to companies that are developing new PV materials and PV-powered systems in the UK, Europe and North America, as well as universities and research institutes,” said Kauer.

“The incorporation of OCN ions significantly reduces the nonradiative recombination in the ultrawide bandgap perovskite film,” the research's lead author, Yi Hou, told pv magazine. “Therefore, the single-junction perovskite solar cells incorporated with cyanate can achieve a higher open-circuit voltage of 1.422 V compared to 1.357 V for conventional perovskite solar cells.”
The scientists explained that OCN may be a suitable replacement for bromide as a precursor material in the perovskite lattice structure. “Our research confirms the atomic-scale incorporation of OCN anions into the perovskite lattice,” Hou said. “The low-damage, atomic-resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) confirms the incorporation effect at atomic resolution for the first time. This is also the first time atomic-resolution TEM images have been captured for a hybrid ultrawide bandgap perovskite film.”
The academics fabricated the triple-junction cell with a bottom silicon device with a heterojunction (HTJ) architecture, a middle perovskite solar cell, and a top perovskite cell integrating the UWBG perovskite absorber with a 5% OCN content.
The triple junction device had a structure integrating the HJT cell, a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), a hole transport layer (HTL) based on a phosphonic acid called methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz), a perovskite absorber with an energy bandgap of 1.55 eV, a buckminsterfullerene (C60) electron transport layer (ETL), a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) layer, another ITO layer, an HTL made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx) and Me-4PACz, the UWBG perovskite absorber, a buckminsterfullerene (C60) electron transport layer (ETL), a SnO2 layer, an ITO layer, and a lithium fluoride (LiF) as an inorganic ionic dopant.
“The UWBG perovskite uniformly covers the middle cell without obvious damage to the underneath layer,” the researchers explained. “The smooth top surface and robust performance of the dual-junction half-cell create an ideal substrate for the subsequent deposition of UWBG perovskites.”
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the triple-junction cell achieved a maximum efficiency of 27.62%, an open-circuit voltage of 3.132 V, a short-circuit current density of 11.58 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 76.15%. For comparison, a benchmark device without the incorporation of OCN ions achieved an efficiency of 25.32%, an open-circuit voltage of 3.021 V, a short-circuit current density of 11.48 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 73.01%.
According to the research team, the introduction of OCN elevates the open-circuit voltage from 1.357 V to 1.422 V and results in the highest combination of open-circuit voltage and fill factor for UWBG perovskite solar cells. The cell was also able to retain around 80% of its original efficiency after 300 h.
“This accomplishment significantly surpasses the power conversion efficiencies previously reported for all other perovskite-based triple-junction tandems as well as single-junction perovskite and silicon solar cells,” Hou stated.
The cell was introduced in the study “Triple-junction solar cells with cyanate in ultrawide bandgap perovskites,” published in nature.
