In addition to power generation, aesthetic aspects are often relevant when it comes to installing building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems. This is especially true when solar power is generated on the facade of a building.
With this in mind, a group of scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE has developed a process to enable the production of solar modules with homogeneous surfaces and different colors that could then be integrated “almost invisibly” on facades or roofs.
The researchers based their technique on the surface structure of the wings of the morpho butterfly – a tropical American butterfly species with dazzling iridescent wings, usually with a pronounced blue area. These wings have a micrometer-fine surface structure that specifically reflects a narrow range of wavelengths. The Fraunhofer ISE scientists succeeded in applying a similar surface structure to the back of the cover glass of their solar modules using a vacuum process.
“The sparkling idea for the development was not to color the cover glass of the modules with color pigments, but rather to imitate the physical effect of the butterfly's wing,” said Thomas Kroyer, head of Coating Technology and Systems at Fraunhofer ISE. “If the glass was coated with pigments, the solar modules would lose much of their efficiency, as the light can no longer penetrate the module unhindered.”
The proposed module technology, which the scientists labeled as MorphoColor, relies on an optical effect. Depending on the structure, cover glass can be produced in bright blue, green, or red. “Around 93 percent of the light can penetrate this layer – only around seven percent is reflected and triggers the color effect,” Kroyer went on to say. The cover glass, which is vapor-deposited in a vacuum process, can be laminated to form photovoltaic modules or integrated into a collector for solar heat generation.
Both technologies could be applied to manufacturing with a single production line. In the future, photovoltaic and solar thermal modules could be given the same color and mounted almost invisibly next to each other on roofs or facades. House walls with completely homogeneous facades could also be realized, and could supply electricity and heat at the same time. A specially developed assembly method could also prevent the tile-sized photovoltaic cells being soldered to one another from shimmering through the colored cover glass like a chessboard. 
The German researchers are currently producing solar cells in strips, which they glue together so that they overlap a few millimeters to form a larger module. This creates a homogeneous whole without disturbing gaps or visible contact wires. “You can look at our shingled photovoltaic modules with MorphoColor coating from different angles – and still the homogeneous impression remains,” Kroyer concluded.

And with many regions setting high targets for renewable energy deployment by 2030, the coming decade will start to bring these challenges into focus. Energy storage technologies will of course be key here, but another strategy that’s gaining ground involves designing hybrid systems based on two more generation sources, and taking advantage of their different variability profiles to boost the level of power available to the grid at a given time.
A group of scientists led by Sweden’s Mälardalen University dived into recent research into this topic, bringing together a series of conclusions that highlight recent developments and suggest research priorities to keep hybrid renewables systems moving forward, noting the  clear potential of the hybrid approach with studies that have shown wind and solar hybrid systems can reduce the need for storage by 50% compared to either technology operating alone. These conclusions are published in the paper A review on the complementarity of renewable energy sources: Concept, metrics, application and future research directions, in the journal Solar Energy.
The authors also reference multiple studies that demonstrated how multiple generation sources can smooth energy fluctuations on wider grids, and suggest that hybrid approaches can also have a positive effect beyond electricity grids in the wider water-energy-food nexus, particularly in cases involving hydropower. “A good case is a power system dominated by hydropower, where the reservoirs are often used for energy generation as well as irrigation purposes (food-energy nexus),” the researchers state. “In such cases, the hydropower generation can be reduced during dry periods by utilizing photovoltaics or wind power.”
The group notes that a range of economic obstacles also stands in the way of further hybrid systems development, and notes Germany’s market premium scheme as a good example of supportive policy. On the research side, a better understanding of the complementarity between different sources is needed, based on field data and modeling that takes into account expected changes to regional climates, more sources of generation, particularly for regions such as Africa and Asia, where little research has so far been carried out. And also key to further development will the creation of a consistent methodology, allowing better comparison between studies and systems.

The 2021 Global Energy Perspective study predicts solar and wind power plants will make up almost half the world's power generation capacity by 2035 and cites the cost competitiveness of renewables-powered green hydrogen by 2030 as another game changer for the energy transition.
With global coal-fired power demand having already peaked, according to the report, the high point for oil will be hit in 2029 and for gas, in 2037, McKinsey has predicted. That would add up to the world's thirst for all fossil fuels combined peaking in 2027.
So much for the good news.
The McKinsey report considers four future energy scenarios and, under its business-as-usual reference case, predicts the world is currently “significantly off of the 1.5C [degrees Celsius] pathway,” in terms of the maximum desired level of global heating. To keep global temperature rises to no more than 1.5C this century would require carbon emissions to halve this decade and to fall 85% by mid century, according to the study, which expects the world to burn through its 2100 carbon budget in the “early 2030s.”
In addition to the gloomy reference case, the study posits two positive future outlooks: one consistent with a 1.5C global heating pathway and a more ambitious scenario in which 10 existing trends, such as the move to electric vehicles, are accelerated. The final, worst-case outlook is predicated on the world's policymakers prioritizing an economic recovery from Covid-19 to the detriment of energy transition-driven legislation.
The impact of Covid-19 is estimated to have hit global energy demand to the extent a recovery could take 1-4 years, according to the McKinsey report, with electricity and gas demand bouncing back faster than oil.
However, the report considers the continuation of pre-pandemic trends such as reduced car ownership to be a more influential driver of the energy transition than the impact of the world health crisis.

German renewables investment company Luxcara and Danish renewables developer Be Green have signed an agreement to build a 415 MW solar project portfolio in Denmark.
The deal includes four different projects to be developed in the municipalities of Faxe, Vordingborg, and Herning, spanning a total area of 429 hectares. Luxcara will manage the PV systems for institutional investors, while Be Green will be responsible for construction and technical management.
The solar parks will be built entirely without government subsidies and the expected annual yield of up to 414 million kWh of solar power will be sold to consumers and businesses via long-term power purchase agreements. The output will supply electricity to 120,000 Danish households per year.
In order to minimize the effects of PV projects on the landscape, Be Green said it always chooses flat land. The Danish company has also developed the country's largest solar park to date, with a capacity of 113 MW. Another 163 MW solar project is currently under construction at the former Vandel air force base in Jutland. It will be completed in the second quarter of 2021, according to Be Green.
Denmark already has subsidy-free solar installations under development, including a 400 MW solar project near Nissum Fjord, a 500 MW installation that Encavis and Greengo agreed to develop in May, and a 200 MW PV plant in Holstebro municipality.
Apple also said in September that its data center in Viborg, Denmark, is now being powered by a 50 MW solar project under a long-term power purchase agreement. Danish developer European Energy built the array, which was sold to Germany's LHI Group in early August.

Nonetheless, management consultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) gives reason to set the bar high, especially in the renewable energy sector. In its economic outlook for this year, the analysts believe global gross domestic product (GDP) will mostly rebound.
With the United States expected to sign back up to the Paris Accord, renewable energy companies are on track to record another successful year. The European Union and China are expected to continue on their trajectories of successive decarbonization, while in Europe, member states will hand in their national plans for a shift to greener economies before May. Subsequently, the bloc will make 0.5% of the Eurozone GDP available, to speed up the realization of its plans, and support this effort with grants worth 5% of Eurozone GDP over five years — that is, €65 billion and €650 billion, respectively.
On top of that comes China's 14th five-year-plan, scheduled for publication later this month, which is expected to include ambitious renewable energy plans. A more coordinated global push, PWC says, might also come on the back of the COP26 meeting, which is scheduled to be held in Glasgow, Scotland, later this year.
In Q2 2020, pv magazine's UP sustainability initiative focused on green financing. Read our coverage and download the white paper.
With targets repeatedly being revised upwards, the cost for infrastructure investment similarly increases. PWC believes that global green bond issuance will step up to foot the bill. Though at present green bonds account for less than 5% of global fixed income, 2021 will likely see this type of financing breaking the $500 billion per year barrier. Green bonds are a type of debt financing instrument aimed to match investors seeking decarbonization projects with borrowers who want to finance them. The proceeds must be used for projects linked to the funding instrument's relevant aim, such as decarbonization and renewable energy projects.
In October 2020, BloombergNEF tracked $200 billion worth of green bonds issued – a 12% increase from the previous year, which saw an end of year sum of $270 billion. The half trillion-dollar outlook becomes even more impressive compared to the cumulative sum of green bonds issued since 2007, when the debt financing instrument first appeared: it reached $1 trillion in September 2020.
An outstanding EU Green Bond Standard will further drive this trend, the analysts say, as standardization of such financial operations will increase investor appetite. It is not just strictly green bonds that will define the conditions under which cash can change hands. The consultancy believes that 57% of the total European mutual fund assets could be held in funds that consider Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria by 2025.
All the contractual ambitions combined with the cash that will be made available is likely to bear fruit, PWC says. Significantly solar PV will grow at a rapid pace in the EU, India, and China. The current trajectory will see solar overtake natural gas in 2023 and coal in 2024, to outrank them as the biggest electricity provider.
Additionally, oil prices have deteriorated during the crisis, as lockdown regulations worldwide saw a reduction in car usage. At least for the first six months of this year, costs per barrel of crude oil aren't expected to climb above the $60 mark, thus not reaching its pre-crisis level. Although it should be noted that while this outlook is reason enough for long faces in the board rooms of oil majors, it is also not shockingly low. Since 2014, the price per barrel has fluctuated around that level.

Baywa re has connected two more floating photovoltaic power plants to the grid in the Netherlands. The projects, developed by the Dutch subsidiary Groenleven, have a combined capacity of 29.2 MW and rely on a total of 70,000 solar modules.
Overall, the Munich-based company has implemented six floating photovoltaic systems in the country, with a total output of almost 100 MW. This makes Baywa re one of the market leaders in Europe, where this segment is still in its infancy.
The floating solar park “Nij Beets” is located on a lake that is also used to mine sand. The modules cover 23% of the available water surface. Special modules and a special construction were used so that enough light and air continues to reach the water surface. There was also enough space left near the shore to protect flora and fauna.
Baywa re and Groenleven are also working together with the Institute for Nature Education and Sustainability (IVN) to improve biodiversity through floating solar parks. The aim is to investigate possible effects on the flora and fauna over the next five years. In addition, all project partners have committed to participating in a community fund for the local population.
Baywa re sees floating photovoltaic systems as a contribution to defusing the debate about land use for the expansion of renewable energies in densely populated regions. “Carefully planned and built, floating PV can be just as cost-efficient as regular ground-mounted systems over an operating period of 25-30 years,” explained Benedikt Ortmann, global director of solar projects at Baywa re.
The company is seeing great interest in the financial markets for floating photovoltaic projects. “It enables a win-win situation for the environment, the local communities and, above all, for a cost-efficient energy transition,” Ortmann continued.
BayWa re and GroenLeven are also building five pilot agrivoltaic power projects in the Netherlands, where they are testing five different types of crops: blueberries, red currants, raspberries, strawberries, and blackberries.

In addition, 15% of loans should meet the wider definition of being ‘sustainable‘ and lenders have been asked to dedicate sustainable finance help desks in their branches to speed roll-out.
“The achievements of the banks and financial institutions in green banking and sustainable financing will be taken into consideration in [the] case of their CAMELS and sustainability rating,” said the central bank in a circular on Monday, referring to the international banking authority rating system which assesses capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity.
The move came after the central bank last month published sustainable finance policy for lenders as part of a government effort to achieve the UN's sustainable development goals.
Under that document, sustainable finance was deemed to include capital for wages and direct labor costs under continuous loans, and procurement of raw materials under demand loans for solar power plants and the assembly and manufacture of solar PV, solar cookers, solar water heaters and solar air heating and cooling systems. The definition also encompasses financing the trading of solar panels for home systems and net-metered rooftop arrays; pico, nano, micro and mini grids; and PV-powered irrigation pumps, cookers, water heaters and air heating and cooling equipment.
With financiers asked to “meticulously” comply with the new lending guidelines, the central bank policy stated: “Necessary actions will be taken against respective banks [and] FIs [financial institutions] for any non-compliance of the said guidelines, credit norms, instructions and returns as per [the] Bank Company Act 1991 and [the] Financial Institutions Act 1993.”
The stick may be accompanied by a carrot, with the policy guideline adding: “The central bank will recognize top-performing banks and FIs on [the] basis of sustainability rating. Besides, it will consider other incentives for top-performing banks and FIs in due course of time.”
The new policy has been well received by Bangladesh's renewables sector.
“It’s a very positive move,” said Dipal C Barua, president of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association. “We heartily welcome this great initiative.”
Barua told pv magazine banks have more than 10,000 branches in the country. “If even every branch disburses one per cent of their loans for green financing, the impact will be huge,” he added, while calling for the green finance to be offered at a lower rate than traditional loans.
Ezaz Al Qudrat A Mazid, founder and CEO of Dhaka-based Solar EPC Development Ltd, told pv magazine the initiative was similar to steps taken in European states to ensure an adequate flow of green finance. “To make the initiative effective … the central bank will have to deploy [a] proper monitoring system,” he added.

Around 154 MW of this new capacity was registered in December alone and brought the country's cumulative installed solar power capacity to 6,667.4 MW. “All installed capacity is based on AC power. Thus, installed DC power might be 15% higher,” the CEO of German company KRC Consulting, Hakki Karacaoglan, told pv magazine.
According to him, however, there is a discrepancy between the numbers published by TEIAS and real installations. “The leaders of the industry report that total installed capacity might be 10-20% higher for 2020. The registrations of lots of installations within the so-called OSBs – industrial zones – might not be reported to TEIAS properly,” he explained.
In 2019, the newly installed PV capacity had reached 932 MW while in 2018, new PV additions had totaled 2.41 GW.
The Turkish PV market is currently being driven by self-consumption and net-metered rooftop PV. Turkey introduced net metering in May and the market has responded by starting to shift away from the megawatt-sized projects which have traditionally dominated.
The Solar Energy Roadmap report published by the Turkish PV association in 2019 predicted the nation could install 38 GW of solar by 2030. A separate study, published by the Istanbul-based Shura Energy Transition Center in May 2018, had predicted solar could pass 20 GW by 2026.

The commune aims to create a network of RECs in its territory to cover the energy needs of half of its citizens, banking on the “unprecedented” public funds.
“Currently we have seven members connected to the REC, of which three are public buildings,” Marco Bailo, mayor of Magliano Alpi, told pv magazine. “We are a small village with 2,200 citizens and a low building density. Since each REC has to be connected to one single transformer substation, the main difficulty has been to understand which users were connected to the same substation. We started with the town hall’s substation but we will soon cover all the municipality’s 13 substations.”
Magliano Alpi is collaborating with other towns in the northwest region of Piedmont. “The municipality of Magliano is bringing in five neighboring municipalities to create a series of RECs. At first, they will be separate entities. Next year, though, with the transposition of the directive 944/2019 on citizen energy communities (CEC), these five municipalities will aggregate to form a CEC,” Sergio Olivero, president of the scientific committee of the REC stated.
The CEC should be just the beginning of a wide-ranging collaboration with several other municipalities, not only in Piedmont, local authorities say. According to Olivero, the law which implemented the RED-II Directive in Italy – and allowed the creation of RECs – is revolutionary. It lays the ground for the first private law entity participated in by municipalities, companies, and citizens.
“It is … public-private collaboration at its best and is an unprecedented opportunity,” he stated. “More has happened in Italy in the last six months than in the six years before that. The private sector can tap into the superbonus or the 50% renovation tax break. The public sector has resources too. In addition, the Ministry of Economic Development grants a subsidy of €110 per megawatt-hour.”
Olivero added, all municipalities with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants have €100,000 to spend on energy communities. This allocation will last until 2024.
Bailo added that several municipalities are using the winter to prepare for the installation of new PV systems connected to the local REC. At the moment, just one PV system is installed, on the town hall. According to the mayor, the installation of the smart meters for the REC's members, and the selection of the management system, were other key decisions.
“In the preliminary phase, before establishing the REC, we contacted representatives of the municipality of Berchidda, a municipality in Sardinia,” Bailo said. “They had created an energy flow management platform. We are now making use of their knowledge and knowhow. Through their platform, we can see the production and consumption of our REC’s members.”
Bailo and Olivero, who registered the REC before Christmas, explain that the aim is to use the “unique opportunity to be part, and take advantage of, the energy transition, a key strategy to relaunch Italy’s economy after the pandemic.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/14/bifacial-perovskite-silicon-tandem-cell-with-25-2-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA,ITALY,SAUDI ARABIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 14, 2021",Bifacial perovskite-silicon tandem cell with 25.2% efficiency,"Researchers from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia, the University of Toronto, the University of Bologna, and Germany's Karlsruhe Institute of Technology have jointly built a bifacial solar cell with a two-terminal (2T) architecture based on perovskite and silicon, in order to achieve a power conversion efficiency of more than 25%.
They experimentally fabricated the tandem device with a silicon heterojucntion (SHJ) bottom cell, textured on both sides, and a perovskite top cell with a p-i-n layout, which was deposited by solution processing.
“To increase the bifaciality, the SHJ rear contact was optimized to combine a minimized series resistance and maximal albedo coupling into the crystalline silicon cell,” the academics said.
The silicon solar cell is a silicon heterojunction, with textured surfaces designed to accommodate the perovskite top cell. The rear transparent electrode was optimized to collect as much albedo as possible, while preserving good electronic properties.
“For the top cell, the perovskite is deposited via solution, which allows for a more practical control of the bandgap, all the other layers are deposited via vacuum deposition, in respect with the industrial standards,” researcher Michele De Bastiani told pv magazine.
The scientists developed the cell with five different perovskite bandgaps of 1.59, 1.62, 1.65, 1.68, and 1.7 eV, which was achieved by altering the iodide-to-bromide ratio in the perovskite crystals. This resulted in a higher open-circuit voltage.
“The tandem short-circuit current density reaches a maximum at a perovskite bandgap of 1.68 eV, which corresponds to the optimal current matching between the subcells of conventional tandems discussed here, and results in an independently certified power conversion efficiency of 25.2%,” the researchers explained.
With a perovskite bandgap lower than 1.68 eV, the researchers were able to use the albedo to compensate for the lack of photons in the silicon subcell.
“In turns, this results in more performing bifacial tandems, above the conventional configuration,” De Bastiani added.
At a testing field in Saudi Arabia, the researchers analyzed the performance of both the conventional and bifacial versions of the device under three different specific albedos consisting of concrete, synthetic grass, and a white background.
“For each condition, we recorded the J–V characteristic with a time interval of ten minutes during a measurement time of one hour,” they said.
They found that the bifacial cell outperformed its monofacial counterpart under all conditions, especially with concrete. The scientists also measured the two kinds of cells in a test field for a week in Saudi Arabia and Germany, in order to study their performance in different climate regions.
“In both sites, the bifacial tandem performed significantly better than the monofacial one, particularly during midday,” the academics said.
They also performed energy-yield simulations to assess the performance of both bifacial and monofacial tandems for different perovskite bandgaps and albedo conditions. They did this under realistic outdoor conditions at locations representing two different climates, in Phoenix and Seattle. The measurements showed that the bifacial devices had power yields that were 32% higher in Seattle and 37% higher in Phoenix.
De Bastiani said the bifacial configuration does not require additional sophistication or higher costs.
“At KAUST we are now looking at scaling the technology towards the industrial standards of the silicon technology, namely six inches wafers,” De Bastiani said. “Tandem will be more expensive than conventional silicon, but the higher cost of the single cell will be better compensated by the higher efficiency, in the end the tandem will payback the cost more favorably than conventional silicon cells.”
The researchers described the solar cell in “Efficient bifacial monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells via bandgap engineering,” which was recently published in Nature Energy.

For the first time since LevelTen Energy began reporting on power purchase agreement prices in the second quarter of 2018, solar PPA offer prices rose in 2020, with fourth-quarter prices rising 11.5% year on year, for an average price of $30.56 per MWh.
Broken down by independent system operator, PJM experienced the highest prices, averaging $37.5/MWh. That was followed by MISO at $33.7/MWh, SPP at $30.5/MWh, ERCOT at $26.7/MWh, and CAISO at $25.1/MWh.
The rise began at the start of 2020, around the same time the pandemic began to spread internationally. But the virus was not the only factor that drove the increase, according to LevelTen.
“In addition to disruptions caused by Covid, grid-connection delays and permitting challenges have created a bottleneck for projects in areas where demand is high, creating supply constraints that have put upward pressure on prices,” said Rob Collier, vice president of Developer Relations.
Collier said that many of the most economically competitive projects have already contracted with offtakers, leaving higher-priced projects available in the market.
Developers with projects on the LevelTen Marketplace sang a similar tune. A survey conducted by LevelTen found that 74% didn’t choose to increase PPA prices to overcome challenges caused by Covid. Only 22% developed fewer projects, which would reduce the competition that put downward pressure on prices throughout 2019.
The only effect attributable directly to the pandemic was on renewable energy project timelines. In that same survey, 59% of respondents said Covid delayed commercial operations dates, and 41% said they delayed PPA negotiations and executions.
Collier commented on this as well, noting that some deals took a little longer than anticipated – procurement and finance teams were “understandably focused on other priorities when shutdowns began. But as the world adjusted to a new normal, renewable energy transactions picked back up. He said the company does not expect the rising prices to soften demand in 2021, as boards of directors, investors, governments, employees and consumers will continue to push for sustainability commitments that will “require all large energy consumers to turn toward renewables.”
Overall, the number of PPA offers on the LevelTen Marketplace continued to grow in 2020, surpassing the number of U.S. offers available in 2019 by more than 50%. This shows that, in spite of rising prices, the market is still healthy and viable.
LevelTen expects that there will still be heavy demand, as customers see PPAs as an economically attractive and proven way to achieve renewable energy targets. The report also highlights a desire to “build back better,” a term coined by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Companies that faced hardships in 2021 will look to rebuild their businesses for long-term sustainability and value creation.
Corporations aren’t the only buyers, however, and many municipalities, states and government agencies will look to stimulate their economy in a sustainable way. LevelTen predicts that this will create more political will to spend on renewables. This will will be bolstered by the incoming pro-renewable administration and Congress.
