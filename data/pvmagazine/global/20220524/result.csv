https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/24/chinese-pv-industry-brief-geely-opens-polysilicon-plant/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"MAY 24, 2022",Chinese PV Industry Brief: Geely opens polysilicon plant,"Geely Automotive has announced that its first polysilicon manufacturing facility has begun production in Gucheng, Hebei province. The factory currently has an annual capacity of 2,000 metric tons (MT) and is expected to reach 52,000 MT by the end of this year.
ET Solar has signed an agreement to build a 5 GW wafer plant with the government of Thai Binh province, Vietnam. This is the second investment of the module manufacturer in the Southeast Asian country, where it already produces both cells and modules. The panel manufacturer said it will invest around $600 million in the new factory.
Xinte, a TBEA-owned solar developer, has revealed that an unnamed person in charge of a 200 MW agrivoltaic project under construction in Hebei province has been detained by the authorities. The project in Xingtang county, near the city of Shijiazhuang, has been suspended pending an ongoing investigation by the authorities into “the suspected crime of sabotage of production and/or other business operations.” Xinte said a unit of its TBEA Xinjiang Sunoasis subsidiary encountered problems during land clearance for the solar farm, including “inadequate mass work, irregularities in contract signing procedure, [and a] lack of supervision, and illegal construction.” The company indicated that 14 villagers had not signed over land for the construction of the power plant. It warned that the project might not reach its planned scale due to a reduction in the amount of available land, but said it would “seriously review and learn deep lessons from” the incident.
GCL Technology has confirmed that its board is considering issuing common stock for a listing on a Chinese stock market. The polysilicon maker's solar project business, GCL New Energy, has secured a three-year contract extension for its $500,000 annual deal to provide asset management and administrative services to fellow GCL Tech unit GCL Solar Energy. Under the terms of the deal, GCL New Energy will manage New Energy’s solar farms in the United States and South Africa.
Irico New Energy has signed a deal to supply CNY 2.02 billion ($303 million) of its glass products to panel maker GCL System Integration, under a deal that will run to April 2024. The news came after the solar panel glassmaker said it would pay CNY 7.95 million for furnace auxiliary fans and CNY 6.44 million for property services to two other subsidiaries of its state-owned parent company, China Electronics Co.
Beijing Energy International has awarded a CNY 535 million engineering, procurement and construction services contract to the Shanxi Electric Power Design Institute to build a 100 MW solar plant in Lingshi county, Shanxi province. Beijing Energy International said it hopes construction will be completed before December. The state-owned PV developer also said it will raise CNY 85 million by leasing solar plants to the Beijing Jingneng Leasing business, which is controlled by its majority shareholder, Beijing Energy Holding. Beijing Energy will pay fees of CNY 102 million over a period of six years to lease back the sites.
IDG Energy Investment Chairman Wang Jingbo has been replaced as CEO by Liu Erzhuang. Wang remains an executive director of the energy investor, which has entered the solar cell manufacturing business. Renewables developer Beijing Enterprises Clean Energy also reported changes after it completed the issuance of 77% of its stock to public body China Shandong Hi-Speed, which has become its main shareholder. Beijing Enterprises raised HKD 4.69 billion ($598 million) from the exercise, with Chairman Zhang Tiefu being replaced by Wang Xiaodong. Chief Executive Yang Guang also stepped down and has yet to be replaced.
Kong Sun Holding has joined the list of solar developers selling off assets to state-owned entities. Shareholders at the annual general meeting on June 24 will vote on whether to raise CNY 529 million by selling off solar projects, which would leave Kong Sun with 390 MW of generation capacity, down from 509 MW at the end of April. The move would also reduce its liabilities by CNY 819 million, by transferring the projects to Zhongyuan Xinhua Water Resources and Hydropower Investment.

The installation will consist of a 50 MW solar park and a 50 MW wind farm. They will both share the same connection point.
“This complementary nature of solar and wind can stabilize the intermittent nature of the energy production and maximize grid connection utilization, leading to significant benefits in terms of dispatchability, flexibility, and reliability,” Shell said, in reference to the grid capacity issues that are currently affecting renewable energy development in the country.
The project is being developed with the support of UK-based Inaccess, which will provide the monitoring system to optimize plant operations. The solution will provide low-level distributed control architecture and grid interaction, as well as data acquisition and scalability. It will also be able to identify cases of underperformance, minimize imbalance costs, and maximize the energy capture price.
“The integrated nature of the Unity system ensures ‘no-excuses' accurate monitoring, control and optimization and acts as the single version of truth among the EPC, O&M, asset management, and market management ecosystem, thus eliminating inefficiencies,” said Shell.
In April 2021, the Dutch solar energy association, Holland Solar, the NWEA wind energy trade group, and the association of energy cooperatives, Energie Samen, defined a model agreement to help owners of large-scale wind and solar power assets to share the same connection points, in order to address grid capacity issues. PV and wind plant owners can negotiate the conditions as if they were starting from zero under the model agreement. This includes planning, contracting with the grid operator, and building and managing common infrastructure for shared connections.
Sweden's Vattenfall commissioned its first hybrid, utility scale wind-photovoltaic-storage project in the Dutch province of South Holland in March.

According to the French automobile manufacturer, its hydrogen hybrid engine means it can run on batteries that are twice as light. “This concept prefigures the exterior design of the new Scénic 100% electric model for 2024,” said Gilles Vidal, VP Renault Brand. The 160 kW electrically excited synchronous motor is at the rear, the 2.5 kg hydrogen tank at the front, while the 16 kW fuel cell is under the floor, at the back of the platform, behind the 40 kWh battery. The car measures 4,490 mm x 1,900 mm x 2,835 mm and weighs in at 1,700 kg. “The H2-Tech technology is based on the ‘range extender' technology, which makes it possible to carry a battery that is twice as light, for the same range, thus contributing to decarbonization beyond the electrification of the vehicle,” the manufacturer said. “In 2030 and beyond, once the network of hydrogen stations is large enough, you will be able to drive up to 800 km – or, for instance, 750 km from Paris to Marseille – without stopping to charge the battery. You will only have to stop for 5 minutes or less to fill the hydrogen tank.”
Japan's Shinshu University researchers have developed a graphene-wrapped molecular-sieving membrane to increase permeation speed, allowing a decrease in the pressure applied and the related energy needs. According to the study recently published in Science Advances, the membrane has a separation factor of 245 and a permeation coefficient of 5.8 x 106 barrers. Graphene is wrapped around the MFI-type zeolite crystal. “This separation membrane separates hydrogen at a speed of about 100 times while maintaining a higher separation coefficient than conventional separation membranes,” wrote the researchers. 
Toho Gas will build a hydrogen production plant using natural gas at Japan's Chita Midorihama Plant. As a first step, the company will build a plant with a hydrogen production capacity of 1.7 tons/day by 2024. “After that, we will expand the scale of the plant in line with the expansion of hydrogen demand in this region,” the Japanese gas distributor wrote, adding it is looking for collaboration with other companies to build the entire hydrogen supply chain.
Topsoe announced it would construct a new Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cells (SOEC) electrolyzer production plant in Herning, Denmark. The 500 MW plant, scalable up to 5 GW, should be operational by 2024. “Construction is scheduled to begin in the second half of this year, subject to Board and other regulatory approvals,” the Danish engineering group wrote on Monday, calling it the “world's largest electrolyzer production facility.”
 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) launched an initiative to develop a roadmap for the commercial deployment of hydrogen production using nuclear energy. The initiative will lead to a roadmap guiding document to provide countries with a tool for evaluating, planning, and strategizing the development of nuclear hydrogen projects. According to Francesco Ganda, the IAEA Technical Lead for Non-Electric Applications, hydrogen production powered by heat from advanced technologies such as high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) is highly competitive in current price scenarios. “HTGRs are under development in several countries, and prototypes are already operating in China and Japan,” said Ganda.
Shell Brazil and the Port of Açu signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the joint development of a pilot plant to generate green hydrogen at the port facilities located in the northern region of the state of Rio de Janeiro. Shell Brazil should invest between US$60 million and $120 million in RD&I in 2022.
bp has announced the participation of energy companies from the United Arab Emirates in its developments in Teesside in the northeast of England. ADNOC, the UAE's largest energy company, will take a 25% stake in the design stage of the blue hydrogen project, while the renewable energy company Masdar will take a stake in the green hydrogen project.

The Geneva-based body said 69% of the patent applications related to hydrogen fuel cells came from China. That contrasted with the picture eight years earlier, when China was the fifth-largest source of innovative proposals in the field.
Companies in Japan hold the largest number of existing patents for transport-related fuel-cell tech, followed by businesses in the United States, South Korea, and Germany. But the authors of the Wipo report published last week suggested Chinese companies will overtake them, based on the number of patents emerging from the nation.
The study concerned patent numbers submitted between 2016 and 2020, a period which saw a 23.4% rise in patent applications for technology to generate electricity for transport from hydrogen and oxygen. Road transport was by far the largest application for the patents submitted, although there has been a rapid rise in innovation for specialist uses such as construction vehicles, forklifts, and airport tugs, Wipo stated.
Japan was the second-largest source of patents in 2020, the UN body added, with the 1,186 submissions from that nation amounting to 11.3% of the total. Some 6.2% of the year's applications came from Germany, 5.6% were from South Korea, and the 403 filed in the United States added up to 3.8%. This means the rest of the world supplied 4.4%.
Companies submitted almost eight out of 10 of the patents filed in 2020, Wipo said, with the top 30 businesses accounting for 40% of the year's patents. There was only one non-commercial originator among the top 30: the Chinese Academy of Sciences, an entity under the State Council of China.

“The Jinko Transparent Curtain Wall Series is based on our n-type TOPCon HOT2 cell technology,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “It can be purchased with different levels of transparency, depending on the project. Light transmittance ranges between 30% and 40%.”
The panel has a power output ranging from 245 W to 300 W with the power conversion efficiency spanning from 12.09% to 13.08%. The open-circuit voltage is between 25.6 V and 28.5 V and the short-circuit current is of 12.09 A to 12.93 A.
It measures 1,759 mm × 1,158 mm × 11.5 mm, has a weight of 54 kg and its temperature coefficient is -0.30% per C.
The operating ambient temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C, said the manufacturer, and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The panel has 6 mm of toughened glass on both sides and its junction box has an IP 67 rating.
Jinko offers a five-year product warranty and a 25-year power output guarantee. The panels are said to be able to operate at 90% of their original performance after 10 years and at 80% in the remaining 15 years.
“The product is also available in different colors and can be adapted to modern architectural concepts,” the spokesperson said. “The dual glass configuration ensures lower crack diffusivity and corrosion resistance.”
*The article was amended to reflect that the module has a length of 1,759 mm and not 1,1759 mm, as we previously reported.

The company began work on the facility in December 2021 and built it with 77 independent structures that each contain 66 solar modules. “It took almost two months to complete the whole solar PV system installation,” business development manager, Eren Ulusoy, told pv magazine. “The stadium has two different and independent grid inputs so there are two different electrical circuits inside the stadium. The PV system had to be split into two independent arrays with a power of 700 kW and 1.4 MW, respectively, to feed different sides of the stadium.”

The system was built with 21 Sungrow 110CX 110 kW inverters and 5,112 Trina Solar TSM-450DE17M(II) 450W modules “It is able to operate in both on-grid and off-grid mode,” said Ulusoy. “There are also seven diesel generators and these generators work with solar PV systems when a power outage occurs.”
According to Ulusoy, the solar array currently produces more energy than its consumption but is not selling excess power to the grid. “The system has the capability to do it, but it's not allowed by the local authority yet,” he said. “We used two different control panels that contained DEIF ASC-4 devices to control the inverters in order to monitor load and generator outputs. These DEIF controllers communicate with each other even if there is no electrical connection between the south and north side of the stadium.”
The Stade du Senegal has a capacity of 50,000 seats and was commissioned by the Senegalese authorities in February.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/24/have-your-say-on-the-future-of-automation-in-solar-om/,"SOILING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"MAY 24, 2022",Have your say on the future of automation in solar O&M,"A series of PV market, technological, macroeconomic, and even geopolitical developments have coalesced to make the automation of solar O&M provision a compelling proposition in 2022. In a recent pv magazine webinar, Wood Mackenzie Principle Analyst Daniel Liu described O&M automation as, “one of the last few places to unlock additional cost efficiencies on a project.”
The webinar was delivered in partnership with robotic cleaning provider Ecoppia, and the company’s CTO Ziv Ramati Miller noted that with two years of Covid-19 lockdowns making site visits at times impossible, automated O&M became the only way production, and profitability, could be maintained.
“It was only on sites that were fully automated that production was allowed to continue almost the same,” said Ramati Miller. “You needed to implement automation just to stay where you are.”
Given the imperative to adopt automation in O&M, pv magazine has partnered with Ecoppia to conduct a first-of-its kind survey into the subject. The short survey has been designed to take less than five minutes to complete, and constructed to reveal insights into the opportunities for automation in O&M and potential impediments to its more widespread adoption.
Complete the survey to influence how automation will be employed in O&M provision today and into the future.
While O&M may not be the first item on a project developer’s agenda, the webinar presenters agreed that how plants are to be maintained should be considered in the early development stages.
“It is true that solar is a very simple and robust technology, but we must keep in mind that your project starts with the early development phase and sometimes we tend to overlook some key considerations,” said Nicolas Chouluer, a partner at Europe-based independent engineers Everoze. “Good maintenance will help keep your asset viable.”
In terms of good maintenance, Ecoppia CTO Ramati Miller argued that technological development has delivered a host of opportunities for O&M automation. And in the current solar market, it is “not only a possibility but a necessity.”
“You really have to combine the data from all sources, and it is not just about solar panel cleaning, but infrastructure, and corrective maintenance. If you can tell in advance which panels need to be switched, then you don’t need to have people on site constantly monitoring the situation. But you need to combine all of these [data] sources.”
Ramati Miller outlined how it is possible today to equip robotic cleaners with a host of sensors that can collect detailed information on module health – and importantly how things develop over time. With robots passing over modules on a regular basis, their ability to collect data in an ongoing fashion is unparalleled, he said.
“There are a lot of options for what can be fitted to a robot,” said Ramati Miller. As an example, he explained how simple sensors can monitor a tracking system’s health.
“One of the most basic situations we offer is just [to monitor] the angle of the panels. When we measure that we can see if angle keeps changing on trackers. Usually, you have a sensor in the middle of a row, at the motor, which might cover two tables. But the angle at the corners might change, and just by monitoring the angles in the corners it lets you know about material fatigue.”
In terms of the size of the opportunity, Wood Mackenzie’s Daniel Liu explains that given the current size of the installed PV fleet, “as a rule the industry needs to be much more proactive about all O&M and in this module washing.” He said that WoodMac anticipates annual non-residential solar O&M spend to reach $15 billion by 2030.
“Automation should ultimately help asset owners identify the true site conditions and give people a better handle on what is needed,” said Liu. “Predominately we have seen that degradation is much higher and one of the main reasons why due to soiling losses being higher than expected – even in places where you would expect rain to be quite frequent.”
The survey results will be presented and analyzed in the pv magazine Global magazine.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/24/south-africa-approves-200-mw-of-pv-under-new-distributed-generation-rules/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH AFRICA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 24, 2022",South Africa approves 200 MW of PV under new distributed-generation rules,"Cape Town-based renewables developer Sola Group has secured approval from the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) to build two 100 MW solar power plants.
The two projects will be located in South Africa's North West province. They will sell electricity through power purchase agreements (PPAs) to US-based titanium products supplier Tronox, which operates several mines and smelters in the region.
“The significance of this first move is that it will pave the way for many more large scale private projects to receive approvals to be able to contribute to generation capacity to the grid,” said Sola Group CEO Dom Wills. “This is a clear signal to the market that private power is achievable and there are private funders that are excited to finance this market.”
The South African government raised the threshold for the distributed-generation solar segment to 100 MW in August 2021, exempting developers from applying for generation licenses to improve the entire permitting process. The new rules also imposed a wheeling fee to be paid to national state-owned utility Eskom for the maintenance and upkeep of its infrastructure to transport the energy.
“Under this mechanism, the energy can be produced by an IPP in one Eskom connected area, and sold to their client in other Eskom connected areas,” said Sola Group.
The company expects to achieve financial close on the two projects in July. It plans to finalize their construction within 14 months.
“The advantage of the wheeling framework is that it allows perfect solar regions to be developed and used to provide power to perfect industrial and mining regions” said Wills. “A perfect solar region is a flat area, with high solar resource, very little environmental or social impact, uncomplicated underground conditions and has access to a strong grid node with good power evacuation potential.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/24/gallium-doping-and-solar-cell-degradation/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MAY 24, 2022",Gallium doping and solar cell degradation,"Silicon PV cell manufacturers have been quick to adopt gallium doping, as it offers a solution to the light-induced degradation phenomenon caused by interactions between oxygen and the boron that was until recently the more common choice for dopant material.
The rapid switch to gallium, however, raises further questions about how gallium will interact with other materials present in the cell and other module components, and how other known degradation mechanisms such as light-elevated temperature induced degradation (LETID) might be affected.
This was the focus for researchers led by Germany’s Insititute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH). They fabricated gallium doped silicon solar cells and subjected them to one-sun illumination at a variety of different temperatures, to better understand how their long-term performance might be affected in the field.
The experiments, in which cells were illuminated while placed on a hotplate at temperatures between 80 C and 160 C for up to 1,400 hours, revealed LETID-related degradation, though to a much lesser extent than in most boron-doped PV cells. The effect is described in full in “Light and elevated temperature induced degradation and recovery of gallium-doped Czochralski-silicon solar cells,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports.
The group found that those cells exposed to higher temperatures lost the most performance – from absolute efficiency losses of 0.15% in a cell left at 80 C, to 0.4% for one at 140 C.
“The activation of a bulk defect is responsible for the observed LeTID effect on the Ga-doped Cz-Si solar cells,” the researchers said. “In our recent lifetime study we ascribed this effect to hydrogen, which diffuses into the silicon bulk during the firing step.”
Once they had reached maximum degradation, cells were placed under lower conditions of 0.5 sun illumination and a temperature of 44 C, which was shown to begin a temporary regeneration cycle after just 15 minutes, and when exposed again to higher temperatures this improved even further.
The group was able to demonstrate regeneration to 0.2% (absolute) more than the cell’s initial efficiency, after around five hours exposed to one-sun illumination at 140 C. This was also shown to partly deactivate the defect causing the losses, and in subsequent testing the LETID losses to the cells were almost halved.
“Stable solar cell efficiencies above 22% were measured after regeneration,” the group concluded. “Meaning that within the uncertainty range of the efficiency measurement, the developed cells on Ga-doped Cz-Si can be classified ‘long-term stable' after regeneration.”

Energy management startup Ez4EV (easy-for-electric vehicles) has introduced a battery energy storage system (BESS) with an EV charging solution, for use in both static and mobile modes.
The EzUrja solution addresses grid availability constraints for EV charging by tapping decentralized renewables-generating platforms such as solar, compressed biogas, and compressed natural gas as the source of energy input, in addition to the grid.
The solution is basically a power bank and a charger on a vehicle. You can prebook it through an app and adjust it according to your requirements, timing, and location. The solution is mobile in that the battery bank can be charged at a decentralized energy generation station and taken to the EV, Ashhok Kapoor, the chief business officer at Ez4EV, told pv magazine.
“In India, charger availability is one aspect, but ultra-fast charger availability is still a little faraway story because of grid issues. If you look at electric buses, 9-meter buses require a 120 kW charger, and 12-meter buses require 240 kW. Providing 240 kW chargers is a challenge in cities,” said Kapoor. “The grid must be equipped to handle a significant rise in peak loads due to the use of fast chargers for EVs. So, we decided to innovate EzUrja EV charging product localized for the Indian scenario. This solution gives the electric buses the juice they need mid-way to complete their routes once they leave the depot. They don’t have to travel back to recharge.”
The EzUrja solution-in-a-box uses a specially designed engine to convert CNG into electricity, an inverter for converting electricity into a DC component, and a DC-DC charger.
US-based C4V is a back-end investor in the EzUrja project. It provides lithium-ion cells for EzUrja chargers. The lithium-ion cells are being manufactured at its 1.8 GWh factory in New York.
“C4V was exploring the application of their battery chemistry, which they developed together with a Nobel laureate. It found a good match in our ultra-fast EV charging concept that is localized for the Indian scenario,” said Kapoor.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/24/enphase-energy-microinverter-secures-first-ul-interconnection-certification/,"INVERTERS,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 24, 2022",Enphase Energy microinverter secures first UL interconnection certification,"From pv magazine USA
Enphase Energy has announced that its IQ8 Microinverter system is certified to UL 1741 3rd edition including the Supplement SB, the new interconnection standard for connecting inverters, energy storage, and distributed energy resources (DER) in compliance with IEEE 1547-2018 and IEEE 1547-1 2020.
Enphase was involved in the development of the UL and IEEE standards and was a member of the committees that created the rules. Included in the new standards are requirements for several advanced interconnection functions that will allow the grid to accommodate much higher levels of renewable DERs. One of these is the interoperability function, which standardizes the way utilities communicate with and control DERs such as solar and battery systems.
“Enphase is pleased that our industry-leading IQ8 Microinverter system is the first product in North America to receive this critical certification from UL,” said Raghu Belur, co-founder and chief product officer at Enphase Energy. “Our close partnership with UL has allowed us to quickly reach compliance with all applicable North America safety standards. We selected UL as our global certification partner and our close working relationship with them has been invaluable in this effort. We look forward to further collaboration with UL to expand our innovative product offerings and help transform the grid.”
The Enphase IQ8 microinverter started shipping in December and what sets it apart is that it can form a microgrid during a power outage, providing backup power even without a battery. The way it works is that the microinverter can limit energy capture to just what the home is consuming, so in the event that the grid suffers a power failure, a proprietary, intelligent chip within the IQ8 will seamlessly switch between on or off grid.
When paired with the IQ Combiner 4/4C and IQ Gateway, the IQ8 forms the first complete residential DER system certified to the new UL standard, which many US states will soon require for interconnecting products.
“We are at the start of a new era in which distributed energy resources, such as solar PV and battery systems, will become a foundational element of the way we think about electricity for our homes, buildings, and tools for utility use,” said Jeff Smidt, senior vice president of industrial testing, inspection and certification at UL. “With the Enphase IQ8 Microinverter as the first ever distributed energy resources product certified by UL to UL 1741, 3rd edition with the SB Supplement, Enphase has taken a significant step in helping advance the safety and security of reliable, clean, and smart energy available in the home or on the grid.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/24/iron-flow-battery-maker-ess-expands-into-europe/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,EUROPE,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"MAY 24, 2022",Iron flow battery maker ESS expands into Europe,"US-based ESS is expanding its operations into Europe to meet “strong demand” in the region for long-duration energy storage solutions. The business is scheduled to officially begin European deployment of its batteries, which provide four to 12 hours of storage, in the second half of this year.
The company currently offers two products: the single shipping container Energy Warehouse and a string of warehouse units in an Energy Center. Its Energy Warehouse for C&I customers is a behind-the-meter unit with 400 kWh to 600 kWh of storage capacity. That makes the power rating configurable from 50 kW to 90 kW. The round-trip efficiency is 70% to 75%, DC-DC. Each battery weighs 16,000 kg dry, and as much as 38,000 kg after it’s filled with the electrolyte. Its 3 MW Energy Center for utility-scale applications packs 6 MW/74 MWh per acre footprint.
ESS has already signed customer orders from Enel Green Power in Spain for the delivery of 17 ESS Energy Warehouses iron flow battery systems, providing a combined capacity of 8.5 MWh. They will be used to support a nearby solar farm and provide resilience for the local power grid.
The company’s market expansion in Europe includes the appointment of Alan Greenshields as director of Europe. He told pv magazine the company still hasn’t decided where to set up its European headquarters, but manufacturing locally is part of its strategy.
European insurance policies, however, are already in place. ESS systems are supplied with a 10-year warranty through Munich Re for its flow battery technology and electrolyte management system, supporting system performance guarantees regardless of project size or location. The ESS battery systems have a prescribed design life of 25 years, but their individual components, including battery modules, electrolyte, and plumbing, may well last for decades longer with proper maintenance.
As Greenshields told pv magazine, the company is expanding its production at a fast pace. The US production capacity stood at 250 MWh last year, but is now already topping 2 GWh. “The customer interest is massive,” he added.
The company manufactures its long-duration batteries with abundant materials such as iron, salt and water, which makes them safe, low-cost and sustainable. They do not degrade with cycling and are not prone to the formation of needle-like filaments called dendrites, which can cause battery failure and even fires in lithium-ion technology.
Another advantage they have over lithium-ion batteries is that they do not need any specific environment for their production, such as ultra-low-humidity dry rooms. They can also be assembled on production lines by robots, similar to washing machines, says Greenshields.
And while lithium-ion might have a lower capital cost per kilowatt-hour, ESS' company’s iron flow system can reportedly claim parity at four hours and win thereafter.
Compared to their technological cousins – vanadium-flow batteries – iron flow claims to win by a large margin. According to Greenshields, the cost of iron-flow stands at around $20/kWh, whereas vanadium-flow costs can be as much as $200/kWh.
