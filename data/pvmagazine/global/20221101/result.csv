He recently published his findings in “Uninterrupted photovoltaic power for lunar colonization without the need for storage,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy.
According to the study, 10 MW of solar capacity is required to continuously power the oxygen factories. The researcher said that installing PV arrays around a 360-degree latitudinal ring close to one of the moon’s poles, with long transmission lines carrying the electricity to the oxygen plants, would be feasible. There would be no inter-array shading, and both static vertical PV arrays and arrays mounted on single-axis vertical trackers could be viable mounting structures.
The strategy exploits the absence of a lunar atmosphere, the near-zero tilt of the moon's polar axis with respect to the ecliptic plane, lunar conditions that are amenable to low-mass inexpensive transmission lines, and a lunar diameter far smaller than that of Earth.
The overriding challenge for setting up colonies on the moon is to continuously provide electricity to factories to produce oxygen. Using nuclear energy or solar combined with storage have been studied as promising approaches, but the new research finds that using solar without storage could be the most efficient solution.
“My solution has a specific mass far below all alternatives so far, namely, record low kg/kW, a key figure of merit for affordable and feasible lunar installations, with launch and installation costs currently exceeding $1,000,000/kg,” said the researcher. “Our new strategy is more than a factor of 100 better than solar with battery storage. It is also at least a factor of 6 superior to the solution now being contemplated by NASA of nuclear reactors driving conventional turbines and generators.”
NASA reportedly might replace its plan to power lunar colonies with nuclear energy by using the solar solution instead.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/01/novel-redox-flow-battery-paves-way-for-low-cost-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"NOVEMBER 1, 2022",Novel redox flow battery paves way for low-cost storage,"Redox flow batteries are one of the most attractive technologies for large-scale stationary storage applications due to their low capital cost, excellent safety, and environmental credentials. Their most unique feature is the independent scalability of energy and power. However, the latter is normally not possible in hybrid flow battery systems.
Now, researchers at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in Cleveland, Ohio, have come up with a concept for a slurry iron redox flow battery. It offers the potential for very low-cost, large-scale energy storage with safe and sustainable materials. By incorporating a conducting carbon slurry into the negative electrolyte of an all-iron flow battery, the researchers have ensured that the iron plating reaction occurs in such a way that makes the decoupling of power from energy possible for their hybrid flow battery system.
“Our iron slurry battery has advantages over the hybrid iron flow battery, where metal is plated into the electrochemical cell,” Nicholas Sinclair, research engineer at the CWRU Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, told pv magazine.
The slurry electrode allows for the plated metal to be directed into tanks for long-duration energy storage, Sinclair said. The hybrid system is limited in how much energy they can store by how much metal fits into the cell.
“In the slurry system, you can simply add more electrolyte and make the tanks bigger without changing the size of the electrochemical cell, which determines the power output,” Sinclair said.
The researchers described the scalability of the novel redox flow battery in “A perspective on the design and scale up of a novel redox flow battery” which was recently published in MRS Energy and Sustainability. They said that while the scaling of flow batteries is simple due to their modular nature, it becomes complicated when making large-scale increases in a single step. Nonetheless, their  proposed battery technology is now edging toward commercialization.
“The battery technology was developed under an ARPA-E program for several years. During that project the technology matured to a point where commercial scale units are now being designed and tested by a company who licensed the technology from us,” said Sinclair. “We have follow-on funding for developing the technology further and expanding it to other battery chemistries as well.”
While the final price tag of the novel battery could change when it is commercialized, cost estimates calculated under the ARPA-E project stand at around $50/kWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/01/putting-bifacial-modules-to-the-test/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 1, 2022",Putting bifacial modules to the test,"The solar industry’s adoption of bifacial cells, which is expected to represent more than half of all silicon PV cells on the market this year, required a few rapid shifts in module design, focused on maximizing the amount of light that can be absorbed from the module’s rear side. And changes to the materials used in a module, as well as to the way it operates, can affect its performance in the field. Several performance issues unique to bifacial technologies have been noted in research and in the field, and even as bifacial becomes a mainstream PV technology, understanding of these problems is still developing.
Scientists led by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have sought to gain a clearer picture of these issues. They put a range of different bifacial module configurations through a series of tests designed to mimic the most extreme of conditions the modules could experience in the field. This series of “combined accelerated stress testing” (C-AST) exposes modules simultaneously to varying temperatures, humidities and voltages, as well as mechanical stress. NREL introduced the C-AST testing protocol in 2020 and sees it is a vital way for the solar industry to understand performance loss in different technologies.
This latest work put PERC cells in both glass-glass and glass-backsheet setups, and devices encapsulated with POE and EVA, through multiple cycles of C-AST testing. The devices tested were “mini modules” each consisting of four 156 mm x 156 mm cells. The results are available in the paper “Evaluation of bifacial module technologies with combined-accelerated stress testing,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
The glass-glass modules were shown to have many more breaks in the grid fingers compared to those using a backsheet – they counted on average 124 breaks in grid fingers for the glass-glass devices, compared to 42 for glass-backsheet. The group attributes this to increased rigidity of the glass.
“On the one hand, if the cell is closer to the neutral plane of the module laminate and the module is more rigid when uniformly encapsulated in glass, it may be expected that the stress on cells and cell cracking is reduced,” they said. “On the other hand, this rigidity may be a disadvantage leading to increased stress if the cell is impeded from deforming, for example, due to strain associated with thermal coefficient of expansion mismatch.”
The testing also found potential-induced degradation, which was highest in glass-glass modules encapsulated with EVA, and that similar results were seen with cells tested in the field over a longer period.
“The results of C-AST show that use of bifacial cells and modules can increase the prevalence of failure modes such as grid finger breaks and PID,” they said. “Consideration must therefore be given to the choice of packaging materials and processes for their mitigation. C-AST indicated that that use of the POE and transparent PVF backsheet reduced propensity for polarization-type PID in glass-glass modules.”

Indian startup Solavio has developed a budget-friendly, portable robotic cleaning solution for rooftop PV arrays and ground-mounted solar installations. Its Eco Bot solution uses a tubular dry-cleaning method to clean panels via airflow and friction from an anti-static microfiber cloth.
“The speed of the robot and the cleaning unit can be modified based on the amount and type of dust,” Suraj Mohan, the co-founder of Solavio told pv magazine. 
The bot, which features an onboard lithium battery, can be manually shifted to serve other rows of panels. The antistatic microfiber cloth does not physically damage the panels.
“We have even used certified global third-party agencies to test and certify the bot over an accelerated period (10,000 cycles) covering the life of the plant,” said Mohan. “There are no limitations on continuous use, thanks to our onboard electronics cooling chamber.”
The battery uses Japanese cell technology and can be charged with a normal AC charger, an AC fast charger, an onboard PV panel, or a dedicated docking station in the field.
The Eco Bot is cloud-based, enabling remote monitoring, control, and spare parts management. The bots can be controlled via onboard buttons, a remote fob, or an Internet of Things (IoT) dashboard.

Upon completion, the plant will be the country's largest solar facility, with an annual production capacity of 175 GWh per year. Completion is expected by 2023, with production starting in 2024.
Construction of the solar park was halted in April when the Skåne county council rejected its application. It said that the land would be better used to help maintain the nation’s food supply. European Energy appealed the decision which the Land and Environment Court in Växjö. The court said that “the protective measures and adaptations that European Energy has proposed to protect the environment are sufficient.”
“It is a milestone for large-scale solar power in Sweden. This case is extremely gratifying for both individuals and companies in southern Sweden who has suffered from shortages and high electricity prices,” said Jens-Peter Zink, Deputy CEO of European Energy. “The solar park in Svedberga will generate new green electricity corresponding to the annual consumption of 35,000 residential households, which is the largest single contribution of new electricity to the region in many years.”
The solar park in Svedberga covers a total area of 232.5 hectares, with about one-third to be used for solar generation. The company said the remaining land could be used for agricultural cultivation. It also plants to reinforce biological diversity by planting trees and bushes on the outer edge of the solar park.
Sweden’s operational PV capacity reached 1.59 GW at the end of December 2021, up from 1.09 GW a year earlier, according to figures released by the Swedish Energy Agency (Energimyndigheten). The figures showed that 2021 was the country’s best year for solar deployment yet, with around 500 MW of new capacity added to the grid.

The sector has seen an unprecedented level of activity in the form of mergers and acquisitions and large scale investments.
Oslo-based Empower New Energy raised $100 million for 150 MW of industrial solar projects while Starsight Energy merged with SolarAfrica. In September, Daystar Power (the company that I co-founded with Christian Wessels) was acquired by Shell, its first acquisition of a power business on the continent.
This flurry of activity might make it seem that C&I solar in Africa is an overnight success, but the sector has been slowly gaining traction since the model first emerged in 2015. A confluence of factors this year – historically high diesel prices, aging power grids, mounting pressure to reduce carbon emissions, and the growing adoption of solar by large multinational manufacturers – have come together to lead to the industry’s tipping point. And the exciting part is that African C&I solar has barely scratched the surface.
Like any new industry, it took time for African C&I solar to gain a hold with businesses. As the model was new, corporate clients had their doubts about solar energy. Chief financial officers were new to signing long-term contracts for on-site installations with zero upfront operating expenditure costs. Facility managers at large factories had concerns about the effectiveness of solar PV or were concerned it would disrupt their existing power set-ups, such as multiple diesel generators, or connection to the grid. However, the cost savings from integrating solar energy into self-generation were undeniable. Today, solar electricity costs roughly $0.10/kWh to $0.11/kWh, which is five times cheaper than electricity generated from a diesel generator ($0.55/kWh to $0.70/kWh) and on par with the national grid ($0.10/kWh to $0.17/kWh).
Image: Daystar Power
In West Africa, especially in Nigeria, businesses effectively run on diesel generators, given the scarcity of grid power. Nigerian businesses regularly cited diesel as their second or third largest expense. Manufacturers point to diesel as representing 40% of operating costs. By replacing diesel generators with solar for daytime power, businesses could save up to 40% on their energy costs. That benefit to the bottom line persuaded many West African businesses to adopt solar. When the first large manufacturers installed solar at their factories, many others in the business community followed suit.
The historical surge in diesel prices – ignited by Covid-related supply chain disruptions and aggravated by Russia’s war in Ukraine – further accelerated the shift to solar. In Nigeria, diesel prices have surged 290%, from NGN 250 ($0.57) per liter to more than NGN 800 per liter, forcing many businesses to reduce operating hours or shut down entirely. Given the new-found trust in the C&I solar model, after years of growing awareness and adoption by large corporations, Nigerian businesses rushed to adopt solar to reduce their dependence on costly diesel generators. This year, Daystar Power received three times more inbound sales requests, just like other solar developers in the country.
Across sub-Saharan Africa, national grids, lacking investment, are struggling to provide reliable power to businesses. At the time of writing, the last time Nigeria’s power grid suffered widespread blackouts was on Sept. 26 and it is likely that it has happened again by the time you read this article. With 12.5 GW of installed electricity generation capacity, only a quarter of that amount of power is actually produced. The country’s grid cannot satisfy the rapidly growing power needs of people and businesses.
Businesses with cold-chain operations, such as pharmaceutical companies and fisheries – as well as heavy industry manufacturers – cannot afford a minute of downtime. Back-up diesel generators are not just nice to have, they are an absolute – and expensive – necessity.
The situation is similar across the region. Yet, given the lack of investment to upgrade aging infrastructure, utilities are forced to raise grid prices.
Multinational corporations, both those already operating in sub-Saharan Africa and those getting ready to expand, have rather strict guidelines when it comes to sustainable development goals. Clean energy might have been a novelty a decade ago but today it is ingrained in the business strategy of some of the biggest companies in the world.
“Should we install solar panels?” is no longer the question. Now, companies are instead asking: “How can we capitalize on solar at scale?” And as procurement departments of these multinationals seek out providers to solarize their operations across the continent, developers with a solid track record will have many big-ticket opportunities in the immediate future.
The African C&I solar sector has a bright future ahead, with Nigeria’s industry alone worth at least $15 billion per year. Increasing adoption rates and changing market conditions have created an environment ripe for newcomers who might have overlooked the continent previously. The advent of novel – at least for this continent – business models, such as carbon credit trading, will only deepen the market. It’s a very exciting time to be in this space.
Jasper Graf von Hardenberg is a co-founder and group chief executive of West African C&I solar installer Daystar Power, which was acquired by Shell in September.

Spain and Portugal have the potential to become a “European energy powerhouse,” according to a new study by Norway-based consulting firm Rystad Energy. The Iberian Peninsula reportedly has a lot of renewables potential, as well as natural gas supplies from North Africa (rather than Russia) and lower electricity prices than the rest of Europe.
“Iberia is well positioned to compete – and even replace – the current energy industrial hub in northern Europe,” said the report.
Spain was the third-largest energy exporter in Europe in the first three quarters of 2022, behind only Sweden and Germany. But the region is expected to experience strong growth in power generation this year and maintain sustained growth in the years ahead, driven mainly by the massive expansion of renewables.
According to Rystad Energy's calculations, the share of renewables in the Iberian energy mix will increase from 48% in 2021 to 64% in 2025 and 79% in 2030. That places the region at the head of the European energy transition and will make it the “renewable leader in Europe,” according to Rystad Energy.
Until 2021, Iberian electricity prices were closely linked to those of other European countries. But since the introduction of the price cap in June 2022, the impact has been clear. In August, electricity prices in Spain had an average of €155 ($153.16)/MWh, while prices were two or three times higher in the rest of the selected countries.
With long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), such as annual ones for 2024 and 2025, Spanish energy is expected to be much cheaper than in France and Germany. The Spanish 2024 annual contract is currently trading at €113/MWh – more than half the price of the French equivalent of €270/MWh.
“This points to a structural advantage in Iberia, as currently viewed by the market, and to a bright future for power generation in the region,” said the report.
The Iberian Peninsula currently has more than 50 GW of installed renewables capacity, with onshore wind power accounting for more than 60% of the total. Solar energy installations have increased in recent years, and more are expected.
“If all goes as planned, solar photovoltaic installations will overtake onshore wind power and will account for more than half of the region's renewable energy by 2030,” said Rystad Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/01/smart-islands-in-greece/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,GREECE,WESTERN EUROPE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"NOVEMBER 1, 2022",‘Smart islands’ in Greece,"Amazon Web Services has launched a pilot “smart island” project on the Greek island of Naxos. It aims to offer digital services on the island in cooperation with 20 domestic and foreign companies and the support of the Greek government.
In a press release, Amazon Web Services said that “existing infrastructure such as the local marina, the energy grid, and water management systems will be upgraded through internet of things (IoT) solutions and smart infrastructure management systems.” Naxos has about 22,000 permanent residents, but it hosts more than 130,000 tourists during the summer.
However, “sustainable energy” is missing from the current list of actions on the island. At present, the project mainly aims to change the transport of goods. The only exception to this is a number of electric-vehicle chargers installed on the island in collaboration with Greece's Eunice Energy Group.
Pilot project
Volkswagen, meanwhile, has launched a smart mobility pilot project on the Greek island of Astypalaia. The German automotive giant is using the island as a testbed for its mobility business model. It has replaced public vehicles with EVs, and in cooperation with the Greek government, is helping inhabitants to replace their private cars with electric models. It is also running a car-sharing service based on a fully electric fleet powered by renewables. 
Volkswagen and the Greek government first agreed to cooperate in November 2020. They launched the pilot the following year, with plans to run it for at least six years. In June, Volkswagen said it had started operating a ride-sharing service and a vehicle-sharing service using electric vehicles. It also started running a second solar system to power EVs.
In 2026, Astypalaia will switch to smart, sustainable mobility and a modern energy system. At the moment, the island – which home to about 1,500 permanent residents – gets most of its electricity from diesel generators.
Separately, the Greek government launched the Halki project in 2021. It features a 1 MW solar array, electric vehicles, and a 5G telecoms network on the island of Halki, which has about 500 permanent residents. The 1 MW solar array is the first operational green energy community project in the Greek islands. It operates under the country’s virtual net metering scheme.
What was striking about this project is that all hardware – the solar panels, the EV fleet, the chargers, 5G network, for example – was donated to the local community by Greek and foreign companies. The energy community, which is the owner of the project, is therefore receiving free electricity and various smart services.
Innovative initiative
However, the small island of Tilos is running Greece’s most innovative electricity project to date. The Tilos energy storage project features a smart microgrid, a 160 kW solar array, an 800 kW wind turbine, and two 1.44 MWh/400 kW battery systems. The island is connected via a subsea cable to the nearby island of Kos. Together with other neighboring islands – Kalymnos, Nisyros and Leros – they form a standalone electricity network, independent of the mainland Greek grid.
The Tilos microgrid and smart platform, which is owned by Eunice Energy Group, calculates the output of its generation units, as well as the stored energy and individual end-consumer loads at all times. It deploys demand-side management techniques at the local, end-user, and aggregator levels, facilitating higher renewables penetration, better operations, and grid-supporting services.
Therefore, using a number of smart devices, software and strategies, Tilos – which is home to about 800 people – is able to eliminate power blackouts, while also supporting the local independent grid. The Greek government released a comprehensive energy storage policy framework for the first time in the summer, but Tilos has proven successful since 2018.
These are all important projects. The Aegean Sea has hundreds of islands and the national energy policy aims to connect the bigger ones to the mainland electricity network, while developing smart energy solutions for smaller, more remote islands that have independent grids. 
Diesel dependence
Greece’s small islands are predominantly powered by diesel generators. Their electrification costs are at least 20 times higher than in mainland Greece. The financial and environmental burden of powering the islands with diesel is shared by all Greek consumers. 
A year ago, the Greek government launched the “Gr-Eco Islands Initiative,” which aims to green the Aegean Sea archipelago. The initiative included a broad map of intended sustainable actions and a €100 million ($99 million) investment pot. The government promised to follow up with a list of small, remote islands that would follow the example of Halki’s energy community. 
Greece needs a series of competitive tenders for small island smart energy systems, in order to build on the example of Tilos. There are plenty of Greek and international companies that could bid in such tenders, offering sustainable and smart solutions. The government could tender clusters of islands or perhaps provide some sort of financial backing.
Most often, it is the synergy of the private and the public sectors that leads to optimal results, while tendering the projects is the most transparent solution. The pilot projects offer politicians the attention they seek, but they are far from the paradigm shift that the country and the islands actually need.

The Bundesnetzagentur says the country added about 750 MW of new solar capacity in September. Around 691.3 MW were subsidized under the country’s EEG renewables incentive program, with 10 unsubsidized projects adding a total of 58.7 MW. The agency says that some entries may have been “duplicated,” so total additions in September stand at around 750 MW.
In the first nine months of the year, Germany added a little more than 4.9 GW of EEG-subsidized PV systems and around 700 MW of unsubsidized projects. In total, the country added around 5.6 GW of new PV capacity up to September.
In September, the authorities awarded large amounts of new solar capacity. In total, these rooftop and ground-mounted systems totaled 270 MW. This leaves 420 MW of new capacity awarded outside of the tenders – almost exactly at the same level as August.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/01/mitigating-new-energy-challenges-with-basf/,"SPONSORED,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 1, 2022",Mitigating new energy challenges with BASF,"The worldwide capacity for renewable energy increased 6% in 2021 reaching close to 295 GW, compared to 2020, where wind capacity addition dipped by 17%, offset by an increase in solar and hydropower installations. According to the International Energy Agency’s Renewable Energy Market Update of May 2022, this happened amidst several demand and supply shocks stemming from the global pandemic.
The addition to renewable capacities is expected to break records in 2022 with an 8% increase forecast, pushing through the 300 GW mark. In contrast to 2020, the global offshore wind installation is predicted to double despite China’s national policy phase-out deadline, while solar PV is forecast to break records in 2023, reaching 200 GW according to the IEA report. At the moment, China accounts for 46% of worldwide renewable capacity addition, followed by the European Union and the United States.
Solar and wind equipment manufacturers and suppliers are navigating a supply chain predicament made worse with countless bottlenecks. Prior to the global pandemic, new energy especially solar power, was gaining traction. However, in 2020 it dropped 64% to its lowest since 2010. From the first quarter of 2021, the renewable energy industry saw skyrocketing raw materials and shipping costs, equipment prices, increased import tariffs, new labor practices and other government regulations. By March 2022, the price of PV-grade polysilicon more than quadrupled, steel prices increased by 50%, copper rose by 70%, aluminum doubled and freight costs rose almost five-fold. Surging freight costs are the biggest contributor to overall price increases for onshore wind. For solar PV, the impact is more evenly divided among elevated prices for freight, polysilicon and metals.
Rising shipping costs and regulatory labor practices from China
China is one of the biggest manufacturers of new energy panels. In 2021, prices of shipping containers leaving from China, such as Shanghai, have increased roughly six-fold from its pre-pandemic baseline. This radical increase in prices could be attributed to the global pandemic where substantial shipments by sea were canceled; to date, even with the global economy opening up and resuming business as usual, the shipping industry is still on a long road to recovery.
Slower production of key photovoltaic components
In 2021, the photovoltaic industry saw its worst polysilicon shortage for the first time in 10 years. The popular demand for solar panels and wind turbines pre-pandemic caused manufacturers at various stages in the supply chain to enter the bullwhip effect, which occurs when a high level of orders are placed, thus sending a ripple effect through the supply chain. However, when the pandemic happened, these same manufacturers slammed the brakes and slowed or ceased production. When economic activity bounced back faster and better than expected, the demand for raw materials soared, and polysilicon miners and refiners struggled to catch up, sending prices skyrocketing.
These supply chain chokeholds have a ripple effect—as many market watchers would already know—and have exposed engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) industries, and developer firms to risks that threaten the success in commercial, industrial, and utility photovoltaic (PV) projects. Further compounding this is the pressure from federal legislators, who are adamant on implementing a “green” economic overhaul as quickly as they can—it has almost become akin to a race of “who has the most green energy production”.
Navigating the supply chain bottleneck with BASF
Will supply chain woes hamper the expansion of the photovoltaic and green industry? The simple answer is “no” but the complex answer is “yes, it will”. If organizations play their cards right, they could meet the demands quickly with the collaborative support of companies like BASF that develop a suite of photovoltaic new material solutions to enable businesses.
