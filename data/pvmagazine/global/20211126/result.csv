The plant’s reactor will be designed by Man Energy Solutions. “In the LOHC Storage Plant, hydrogen is chemically bonded to the LOHC material benzyl toluene, a thermal oil. This carrier oil can be transported under ambient conditions in conventional and existing logistics infrastructures comparable to the delivery of petroleum or diesel,” Frames wrote on Tuesday. The LOHC loaded with hydrogen will be loaded to a truck for road transport to LOHC Release Plants and hydrogen offtakers in Europe, among others in Rotterdam.
German emission-free hydrogen fuel cells company Proton Motor Fuel Cell and Austria’s xelectrix Power developed a complete system that combines fuel cell and battery storage technologies. “The PM-H/LFP-240 system will enable the replacement of diesel generators – an increasingly important aspect with regard to the challenges of climate protection. This unit is designed as a stand-alone system, so that high-performance energy can be provided far away from the public grid but will also be used in Commercial and Industrial applications, especially where back-up is required. The system has a fuel cell output of max. 129 kW and a system output of 240 kW. Battery packs with LFP cells with a maximum capacity of 240 kWh covering the corresponding peak load coverage and respective autonomy times,” the two companies wrote on Thursday.
U.S. hydrogen solutions company Plug Power has been selected as the technology provider for a 100 MW electrolyzer in Egypt by Fertiglobe, a partnership between Dutch distributor of nitrogen and methanol products OCI, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Norway’s renewable energy company Scatec, the Sovereign Fund of Egypt, and Egypt-based engineering and construction contractor Orascom Construction. The electrolyzer will produce green hydrogen as feedstock for up to 90,000 tons of green ammonia in Ain Sokhna, Egypt. “At start-up, this will be the largest green hydrogen and largest green ammonia application globally. Construction is expected to follow an accelerated schedule to showcase the green hydrogen facility during COP 27 in Egypt in November 2022, highlighting Egypt’s and Fertiglobe’s growing leadership in the renewable energy markets and commitment to a greener future,” said Nassef Sawiris, Executive Chairman of OCI NV. In October, Plug Power and French renewable hydrogen startup Lhyfe signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly develop green hydrogen generation plants throughout Europe. Earlier this week, Plug Power announced its European headquarters will be located in the Port of Duisburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
Germany's new coalition government announced on Wednesday plans to accelerate energy transition measures, betting on central support for green solutions, including solar and hydrogen. The three parties want to achieve an electrolysis capacity of around 10 GW by 2030, double the capacity stated in the national hydrogen strategy compiled by the outgoing government. “We are accelerating the massive expansion of renewables and the construction of modern gas-fired power plants in order to meet the growing demand for electricity and energy at competitive prices over the next few years. The gas-fired power plants that will be needed until supply is secured by renewables must be built in such a way that they can be converted to climate-neutral gases (H2-ready). Natural gas is indispensable for a transitional period. The hydrogen strategy will be updated in 2022,” the Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens, and the Liberal Democrats (FDP) wrote in their coalition contract. The new Government wants to expand offshore wind energy, quadruple solar PV installations on all rooftops, pushing renewable capacity to 80% of the electricity mix by 2030 (previous goal: 65%). The hydrogen strategy also hinges on collaborations with other countries. The new government states, for instance, that Ukraine is a potential exporter of green hydrogen. The main focus is on European projects though. “We are committed to the establishment of a European Green Hydrogen Union. To this end, we want to quickly implement the IPCEI Hydrogen and financially support investments in the development of a hydrogen network infrastructure. In this way, we want to become the lead market for hydrogen technologies by 2030,” the SPD wrote on its website.
South Korea’s Energy Minister Moon Sungwook and Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum attended the 4th Meeting of the Hydrogen Economy Committee on Friday. Moon presented the government’s implementation strategies “to make Korea a first mover to build a hydrogen economy.” The government plans “to supply 27.9 million tons of green/blue hydrogen in 2050, and expand the self-sufficiency rate of clean hydrogen to over 60 percent.” By 2050, hydrogen should be the main energy source, replacing oil. The country’s hydrogen strategy hinges on imports, with a gradual increase in indigenous production in the next decades. South Korea is collaborating with several countries in the energy field, including in Central Asia and South America. It is also speaking with the United States. “The Ministerial ROK-U.S. Energy Policy Dialogue (EPD) will serve as an innovative cooperation platform for achieving the two countries’ 2050 carbon neutrality targets,” commented Moon earlier this month.
U.K.-based green hydrogen energy company Protium and the U.K.-based project partner ITPEnergised have written that the Dynamic Combustion Chamber hydrogen technology patented by Jericho Energy Ventures “will help to successfully decarbonise Bruichladdich Distillery’s operations following an extensive feasibility study during Q1 2021.” The pilot project will use hydrogen combustion technology to heat the stills used to create Bruichladdich’s Scotch, as well as the company’s artisanal gin. “The funding of £2.65m comes from the Green Distilleries Competition, funded through the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Net Zero Innovation Portfolio and follows an initial feasibility study completed in the spring of 2021,” reads the press release published on Wednesday, adding that green hydrogen represents a “sustainable solution for … remote location and infrastructure challenges.”
U.S. President Joe Biden has signed into law a US$1 trillion (€0.89 trillion) infrastructure package, investing in demonstration projects and research hubs for next-generation technologies. “The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also invests $21 billion [€18.73 billion] in demonstration projects for technologies, like clean hydrogen and advanced nuclear, that will put people to work in every pocket of the country,” said Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm on Tuesday. According to Argus Media, the bipartisan package, signed on November 15 includes $9.5bn (€8.47 bn) in direct funding over the next five years. On Wednesday, the White House announced the launch of a new Energy Division and the hiring of several high-profile experts. “These moves reinforce the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to using science-based approaches to reduce emissions and scale-up a clean and equitable energy system,” the White House commented.

France's Ministry of Ecological Transition has published new statistics for solar and wind energy deployment for the third quarter of 2021. The good news for the sector is that newly deployed solar power in the first nine months of the year totaled 2,034 MW, which compares to 761 MW in the same period of 2020.
This year's growth is explained by an increase in the number of connections but also by a high share of utility-scale solar installations. Around 65% of the new connected power corresponds to installations bigger than 250 kW, which represent less than 1% of the number of new connections. Small-sized installations, less than 9 kW, represent nearly 83% of the number of newly connected units and around 7% of the installed capacity.
The aggregate capacity of queued solar projects with a grid-connection request has increased by 18% since the start of the year to 10.6 GW, including 3 GW with a signed connection agreement.
As of September 30, 2021, the country's cumulative installed solar capacity reached 13,231 MW, including 12,583 MW in mainland France.
Since the start of 2021, solar PV production has stood at 12.5 TWh, compared to 11.4 TWh for the same period in 2020. Solar power generation represents 3.7% of French electricity consumption, up slightly compared to the 3.5% in the previous year.
In geographic terms, the regions of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Occitanie, Grand Est, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur account for 68% of the newly connected power in the territory during the period. These are the regions with the highest installed capacities, representing 67% of the cumulative power connected in France at the end of September 2021.

The novel technology for smart navigational markers intends to improve the safety and efficiency of maritime fairways through digitalization. The buoy is 10-meters high, with 3.5 meters visible above the water surface, and is equipped with an LED lamp. Its diameter measures 80 cm.
“The solar cells are integrated into the buoy and the batteries are specially constructed to be resilient to icy winters,” the Ports of Stockholm said in a statement. “The rechargeable batteries are more sustainable, with an operational lifetime of between 7-10 years, in comparison to the current normal one-year lifetime.” No more details on the solar cell technology used were disclosed.

Remote monitoring will be implemented for the batteries, solar cells, and light signal. “This makes both service and maintenance more efficient, as the number of times a service vessel needs to be sent out are fewer, which also reduces emissions,” the statement reads.
The smart buoy is being developed in the framework of the EU-funded Intelligent Sea. Via the project, floating as well as land-based aids to navigation are equipped with devices for remote monitoring and control as well as environmental sensors.
The buoy was developed by project partner Meritaito Ltd, a uni of Finland-based fairway maintenance service provider Arctia group, which in 2020 developed a solar-powered sniffer buoy for air quality and emission monitoring.
“The Sniffer Buoy can be installed almost anywhere and is easily moved to adjust to seasonal winds or changes in vessel operation routes,” said Arctia in a statement released in June 2020. “The Sniffer Buoy has its own power unit, basing on solar power, so no external infrastructure investments or regular battery exchange is needed.”

It noted that this price level is still three times higher than that reported last January. As for wafers, PV InfoLink says that M10 (182 mm) wafers saw their price decline 4.9% to RMB5.38 per piece and M10 (175 mm) drop 5.64% to RMB6.36. G12 (210 mm) wafer prices remained stable at RMB8.93 per piece. This trend is due to high inventory levels and low operation rates of wafer factories. Referring to solar cell prices, PV InfoLink said that M10 PERC monocrystalline cells are now cheaper by 0.9% at RMB1.14 per W, while the price of M6 mono PERC cells dropped 1.9% to RMB1.08 per W. A price drop was also reported for G1 (158.75 mm) mono- and poly-crystalline products, which saw prices decrease over the previous week by 1.7% and 2.8%, respectively. Furthermore, according to PV InfoLink, last week solar module prices dropped for the first time in the past six months. Average prices for M6, M10 and G12 mono PERC modules fell by 1%, 1.4% and 1.4%, respectively, to RMB2.01, RMB2.04 and RMB2.04 per watt.
Polysilicon manufacturer Daqo said it will increase investments in its plan to expand capacity from RMB576 million to RMB4.09 billion. The plan relates to the addition of new manufacturing capacities totaling 35,000 MT.
PV wafer manufacturer Shuangliang Eco-Energy announced on Wednesday that it had placed an order with Asia Silicon to purchase up to 25,210 metric tons of polysilicon from December 2021 to November 2026, based on a monthly determined price and quantity.
The China-based solar manufacturing unit of Sino-Canadian business Canadian Solar on Wednesday announced the signing of a strategic co-operation agreement with battery giant CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd) relating to battery systems, lithium-ion battery modules, operations and maintenance, and technology. Announcing the deal, Canadian Solar chairman and CEO Shawn Qu said his business had a 21 GWh global battery storage pipeline, including 2.9 GWh under construction.
Shareholders at heavily-indebted clean energy project developer Shunfeng International will vote, on December 13, on the proposed sale of almost a quarter of the company’s 763 MW solar portfolio to raise RMB538 million ($84.2 million). Shunfeng missed another payment deadline a month ago by failing to pay RMB255 million ($39.9 million) owed to investors in a 2016 bond and are set to have to find HK$175 million ($22.4 million) by Tuesday to settle with investor Rainbow Fort, plus HK$300 million ($38.5 million) for China Minsheng Banking Corp by the end of the year. The proposed sale of seven solar projects with a total generation capacity of 190 MW, to state-owned China Power Investment Xinjiang Energy Chemical Engineering Group Akesu Co Ltd, would book a projected loss on the value of the assets of RMB148 million ($23.2 million) – up from the previous estimate of RMB100 million ($15.6 million) – but would reduce company liabilities by RMB1.1 billion ($172 million).

At current prices, the technology is becoming viable in supporting regional electricity grids, increasing the value of renewable energy projects and powering electric vehicles, Aside from consumer electronics, where it has been established for several decades, many projects implementing lithium-ion batteries still rely on subsidies and other policy incentives, and will need to get even cheaper for this to change.
Earlier this year, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) calculated that lithium-ion battery costs have fallen by 97% since 1991. Now, some of the same researchers who produced that calculation have looked even more closely at these cost reductions to determine the key drivers behind them, and ideally to help ensure that the industry continues down the optimal path to low cost, highly efficient energy storage.
Their findings are available in the paper Determinants of lithium-ion battery technology cost decline, published in Energy & Environmental Science. The group examined data from a wide variety of sources, reaching the conclusion that improvements to the technology through research and development have been responsible for at least 50% of the price reductions achieved so far.
“The data collection effort was extensive,” Ziegler says. “We looked at academic articles, industry and government reports, press releases, and specification sheets. We even looked at some legal filings that came out. We had to piece together data from many different sources to get a sense of what was happening,” explained MIT scientist Micah Ziegler. He estimates that the research took in about 15,000 data points, gathered from 1,000 individual records from approximately 280 references.
The group’s analysis finds that research efforts to increase cell charge densities made a 38% contribution to the overall cost reductions, while work to reduce cost of cathode materials made up 18%. Reductions in non-materials costs made for 14%, and another 9.5% from improvements in charge utilization.
Overall, the group estimates that 54% of cost reductions in lithium-ion can be attributed to research and development efforts, and economies of scale in production making up another 30%. They note that ‘learning by doing’ improvements in manufacturing and battery system design could account for only 2%, which the group says is notable since many of the most significant research achievements came long after initial commercialization of the technology. “There were so many variables that people were working on through very different kinds of efforts,” said MIT professor Jessika Trancik, “The cost improvement emerged from a diverse set of efforts and many people, and not from the work of only a few individuals.”
The group says that disentangling the sources of cost-reduction in this way can help to inform future policy and industrial development, noting in particular that as manufacturing reaches massive scales, funding and incentives may be needed to counter market forces favoring incumbent technologies and leading to a ‘lock in’ effect.
“This is really getting at the fundamental mechanisms of technological change. And we can also develop these models looking forward in time, which allows us to uncover the levers that people could use to improve the technology in the future,” added Trancik. “The new approach allows us to potentially be a bit more intentional about where we make those investments of time and money.”

The experts also expect the country's cumulative capacity to grow from around 6.3 GW currently to 10 GW by the end of next year, despite an upcoming market contraction in the distributed generation segment.
In 2021, small-sized residential PV systems will account for around 2 GW of the newly deployed capacity. The IEO analysts explained, however, that this year's growth will be mainly due to an end-of-year really, as the current net metering rules and incentives will expire at the end of December. “Starting from 2022, the prosumer market may begin being saturated, and each subsequent year will mean stable development not exceeding half a gigawatt per year,” they said.  
The upward trend for the solar sector in Poland will be maintained by the utility-scale segment that, according to the forecast, will equal the installed capacity of the distributed generation segment at the turn of 2023-2024. Furthermore, commercial and industrial self-consumption projects may see an increasing interest by big consumers in the Polish energy landscape and reach a 10% share at the end of 2023.
“The challenge posed by the photovoltaic market is the need to expand the grid and make it more flexible, at all voltage levels,” the IEO report concludes.
In a previous report published in March, the research institute said Poland was on track to reach 14.93 GW of PV capacity by 2025.
The country is currently supporting solar through an auction scheme and incentives for rooftop PV.

The Minister of Environment and Climate Action of Portugal, João Pedro Matos Fernandes, has launched an auction for 263 MW of floating solar PV capacity to be deployed on seven national dams.
The minister revealed in a press conference that interested developers will have until January 29, 2022, to submit their project proposals
In the auction, 263 MW will be allocated across seven different dams: Alqueva (50 MW), Castelo de Bode (33 MW), Cabril (33 MW), Alto Rabagão (42 MW), Paradela (13 MW), Salamonde (8 MW) and Tabuaço (17 MW)
 
The vice president of the Portuguese Environment Agency (APA), José Carlos Pimenta Machado, explained that in the territories of the dams under concession, “the body of water is public, the bed and the banks are private,” which allows auctions to be held openly.
The minister further clarified that power production by the floating facilities will be allowed for 30 years, but that the selected developers will be awarded a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA). “Then they have the other 15 years to produce under normal market conditions,” he said.
According to Secretary of State, João Galamba, the APA has “identified around 700 hectares in the basins already studied” for potential exploration in the future. “In this way, we can launch a set of auctions with a stable schedule between 2024 and 2025,” he said.

“We used the panels to investigate the trade-off between energy production for an advanced aquaponics greenhouse, and its effect on filtering light for crop growth,” research author, Luigi Vesce, told pv magazine. “We covered a 2 m2 greenhouse area with 40 modules.”
The solar panel has a power conversion efficiency of 3.88% and a transparency of 35%. Its active area measures 221 cm2 and the module’s aperture area is 312.9 cm2. Its creators claim the module exhibited significant stability when stressed for 1,000 hours at temperatures ranging from 60 to 85 Celsius degrees and under light soaking.

The solar cells were connected in series by the research through a manufacturing process that occurs completely in ambient air. “The width of the single-cell was designed according to well-known compromises between losses in the efficiency of the geometrical area and resistivity of the transparent FTO electrodes,” said the team. The photoelectrode and the counter-electrode were made of glass and screen printed with silver contacts.
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) paste provided by Australia-based manufacturer GreatCell was applied to the photoelectrode. “The resulting layer of TiO2 acting as a wide band-gap semiconductor was 5 μm thick with an approximately 20 nm particle size, in accordance with a TiO2 layer for semi-transparent application,” the scientists noted, adding that the module was assembled by laminating two cell strings via a hot vacuum lamination process using an industrial laminator. “Two 4 mm-thick tempered glasses were used as external substrates and two 450 m-thick low temperature cross-linking EVA sheets as encapsulants.”
Image: Tor Vergata University of Rome
When tested in the greenhouse, the panel initially showed an average efficiency of 2.5%, an average voltage of 8.9 V, and an average current of152 mA. Its nominal power was found to be between 2 and 3 W. After a few days, however, the power conversion efficiency increased by around 30%. “Typically, in DSSC technology the best efficiencies are observed several days after the device manufacture,” the Italian scientists explained.
According to them, the solar modules are capable of supplying a portion of the electricity required to power the greenhouse's temperature and humidity sensors. “Preliminary results concerning plant growth under filtered light from DSSCs suggest no differences between the growth of lettuce under natural and DSC-filtered light,” they said, adding that more research is needed.
All the technical details on the new module can be found in the paper Stable Semi-Transparent Dye-Sensitized Solar Modules and Panels for Greenhouse Application, which was recently published in Energies.

“The solution utilizes an open-loop solar drain-back style system that is coupled to the Phoenix which would be mounted on a wall near a hot water storage tank,” the company's founder, Freeman Ford, told pv magazine. “The simplicity of the system lends itself to a quick to understand and install solar system along with an all-in-one heat pump, circulation module and additional thermal storage of approximately 5kWh.”
The Phoenix system consists of three elements: a CoolPV photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) module manufactured by Fafco; a 5 kWh thermal battery with a heat pump, two braised heat exchangers, two pumps, and multifunction software; and a 50-gallon electric hot water heater provided by unspecified manufacturers in California.
“The system consists of several well-known and proven technologies connected in a novel way with patents issued and pending,” Ford further explained. “The system uses software for several purposes including to optimize performance and load level for the utilities.”
According to Fafco, the two circulation pumps with speed control are designed for optimal efficiency. One supplies the solar loop and the other for getting the heated water to and from the hot water storage tank. These pumps interface with the refrigerant loop in the heat pump via the two brazed plate heat exchangers that have been specified, optimized, and tested for this purpose.
The system, according to the manufacturer, has several advantages compared to what is available on the market today. For example, the system is connected to 120Vac, which eliminates the requirement to rewire for 220Va, and, is said to be 50% more efficient than the air-sourced systems being sold today. “Furthermore, it is designed for retrofit in existing systems or a different version can be used in new home construction,” Ford said. “Phoenix systems will be interconnected for use by the electric utilities to shift load from peak to off-peak demand.”
The 60-cell monocrystalline PVT panel is made with a photovoltaic module provided by U.S. manufacturer Silfab that has been retrofitted by Fafco with its own thermal collector system. It is available with PV power output ranging from 310 to 330 W and power conversion efficiencies ranging from 18.2 to 19.4%. The open-circuit voltage spans from 36.69 to 40.50 V and the short-circuit current from 10.22 to 10.42 A.
All CoolPV modules (including the thermal unit) measure 1,700 x 1,000 x 123 mm, weigh in at 26 kg, and have a roof load of 15.3 kg/m2. The power temperature coefficient is -0.36% per degree Celsius and the maximum system voltage is 1,000 V.
As for the thermal panel, which is the same for all three module wattages, it has an operating pressure of 20 pounds per square inch (psi) and an operating temperature range between 15 and 38 degrees Celsius. Its stagnation temperature is 58 degree Celsius. For a commercial pool case study, the manufacturer recommends the installation of 40 CoolPV modules with an aggregate capacity of over 12 kW.
The California-based company plans to launch the Phoenix system next year. “Initially our sales will focus on new home construction, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and PV dealers,” Ford said. “We expect to be selling Phoenix by late 2022 accelerating exponentially in the years to follow.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/26/itrpv-more-work-needed-to-process-210mm-wafers/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,GERMANY,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 26, 2021",ITRPV: More work needed to process 210mm wafers,"German engineering association, Verbandes Deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbau (VDMA) yesterday published an update to its 2021 International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics (ITRPV) report first published in April.
The annual report provides an outlook on which technologies and materials will be implemented in PV manufacturing in the coming years, based on information voluntarily provided by manufacturers. This week’s update features additional discussion of the readiness level for various solar manufacturing technologies, and a ranking that clarifies which of the report’s forecasts rely on expected improvements to current manufacturing process, or the implementation of new techniques not yet available in mass production.
The introduction of new sizes for silicon wafers, primarily 182mm and 210mm, has been the biggest story in PV manufacturing for the past couple of years already, and processes all along the supply chain have had to be adapted to suit these new sizes.
The key takeaway in this ITRPV update is that the largest size, 210mm, still requires development of processes not yet used in mass production to keep up with the production cost of smaller formats, including 182mm. And most analysts predict an initial advantage for 182mm, with 210mm taking a larger share by the second half of the 2020s.
The challenge, according to VDMA, comes in matching the throughput – the number of cells that can be processed per hour. “An evaluation of the technology maturity level of the throughput in cell production shows that the readiness level of the throughputs across all process steps is analogous for the sizes 166 (+/-0.25) mm² and 182 (+/-0.25) mm²,” stated the association. “In contrast, the readiness level related to the throughputs of cell production of the larger wafer format of 210 (+/-0.25) mm² shows that more development work is required in the future.”
Looking at PERC technology, VDMA’s survey finds that the metallization and chemical processing stages of cell production already have mature solutions to process 210mm cells, and for these all sizes are expected to develop in unison – with metallization set to reach 12,000 cells per hour by 2028.
Thermal processing stages, meanwhile, are somewhat slower to run. And here VDMA notes that for 210mm cells to match the expected 11,000 cells per hour throughput that’s expected for smaller formats, more work will be needed. “An evaluation of the technology maturity level of the throughput in cell production shows that the readiness level of the throughputs across all process steps is analogous for the sizes 166 (+/-0.25) mm² and 182 (+/-0.25) mm,” reads the report. “In contrast, the readiness level related to the throughputs of cell production of the larger wafer format of 210 (+/-0.25) mm shows that more development work is required in the future.”

The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) has determined that tariffs continue to be necessary for U.S. industry producing crystalline silicon PV cells.
All five commissioners determined that so-called Section 201 “safeguard” tariffs continue to be necessary to “prevent or remedy serious injury to the U.S. industry,” and that evidence exists that the domestic industry is “making a positive adjustment” to import competition.
The USITC will forward its report on its investigation and determination to President Joe Biden by December 8. The president will make the final decision on whether to extend the import relief.
Chair Jason E. Kearns, Vice Chair Randolph J. Stayin, and Commissioners David S. Johanson, Rhonda K. Schmidtlein, and Amy A. Karpel all voted in the affirmative.
Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said in a statement, “Four years of tariffs has proven to be an ineffective way to incentivize solar manufacturing and create American jobs.”
She said that a new round of Trump-era safeguard tariffs “will hamper U.S. solar development.”  SEIA has argued that under the Section 201 tariffs, the U.S. lost out on 62,000 solar jobs, including a net-loss of 6,000 solar manufacturing jobs.
In a guest column for pv magazine earlier in November, Brian Lynch, director of solar sales for LG Electronics USA wrote, that opposition to the tariffs in 2018 highlighted the possibility for project cancellations and lost jobs if the tariffs were to be imposed. He wrote that at a macro level, “the solar industry has exceeded every forecast during the period of the tariffs in every category— from megawatts deployed to jobs created.” Lynch offered formal testimony to the USITC at its November 3 hearing on the extension.
Lynch said that enough U.S. manufacturing capacity existed (or was in the pipeline) to support roughly one-third of installer demand, writing that “a lot of this capacity was brought online since the Section 201 tariffs went into effect and a lot more has been announced.”
George Hershman, CEO of SOLV Energy, a utility-scale solar installer, said the USITC’s decision “will come at the cost of American jobs and the President’s clean energy goals. Solar tariffs create more barriers to the deployment of renewables and lead to higher costs for consumers, stifling the transformation of our energy landscape.”
He called on Biden to end “all unnecessary tariffs” on the solar industry and work with Congress to support a long-term manufacturing policy for the solar supply chain.
At the beginning of August, two manufacturers, Suniva and Auxin Solar, filed a petition asking the USITC to investigate extending the Section 201 (s201) tariffs for another four years. Three days later a second petition was filed by Hanwha Q Cells, LG Electronics, and Mission Solar, which also included an ask that the Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ) be increased to 5 GW (from the current 2.5 GW).
The s201 tariff is imposed on all solar modules imported into the U.S. that don’t meet exemption status as published in the Federal Register. The current s201 tariff is 18% and, if the tariff is not extended, would drop to 0% in February 2022.
Under trade law, if the USITC grants an extension of the s201 tariff it will last no longer than four years and cannot be extended again. The rate must also drop annually.
Expectations are that module prices likely will not go up as a result of the s201 tariffs being extended, as the tariff rates cannot increase from their current levels.
The Commission’s public report Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled into Other Products, (Inv. No. TA-201-075 (Extension), USITC Publication 5206, December 2021) will include the Commission’s findings and is expected to be available in late December.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/26/vsun-tests-flow-battery-technology-with-standalone-pv-powered-ev-charger/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 26, 2021",VSUN tests flow battery technology with standalone PV-powered EV charger,"From pv magazine Australia
VSUN Energy, the renewable energy generation and storage subsidiary of Perth-based miner Australian Vanadium Limited (AVL), has completed the first phase of a trial of vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) technology that it said could deliver a truly green charging network for electric vehicles (EVs).
The trial, based at the AVL and VSUN Energy Research and Development Centre in the Perth suburb of Bayswater, tested an AC charger coupled with a 5 kW/30 kWh VRFB powered entirely by a 3 kW rooftop solar PV system.
VSUN business development manager Zamien Sumich said VRFBs were the “missing piece of the renewable energy jigsaw” and the trial opens the way for standalone EV charging stations to be installed anywhere in Australia.
“The VRFB is well suited to the capture and storage of large quantities of renewable energy, enabling stable power output,” he added. “Vanadium electrolyte doesn’t degrade, meaning that thousands of EV batteries can be charged from the station. The VRFB’s long life, exceeding 20 years, makes it one of the most sustainable and long-lasting ways of storing renewable energy. At the end of the battery’s mechanical life, the vanadium electrolyte can be reused indefinitely.”
The penetration of EVs in Australia lags behind many developed nations with the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) indicating only 6,718 were sold nationally in 2020. That contrasts with China, the world’s largest EV marketplace where 1.3 million vehicles were sold last year.
EVs are however gaining momentum in Australia with new car sales data revealing that 8,868 battery and plug-in EVs were sold in the first half of 2021, which is more than in any calendar year.
The Federal Government has forecast that 30% of new car sales in 2030 will be electric, compared to about 1% at present but Perth-based federal Labor MP Patrick Gorman said the lack of reliable EV charging infrastructure – at departure point, en route and at the destination – has been identified as a sticking point to increased ownership.
“Australia lags well behind the rest of the world when it comes to the uptake of electric cars,” he said.
“This trial is significant in that it removes one of the barriers to the take-up of electric vehicles in Australia – the distance between and availability of charging stations.
“Having a stable renewable energy charging system for electric vehicles will be a big boost for the Australia electric car market.”
VSUN is collaborating with its Singaporean partner V-Flow Tech and Western Australia-headquartered EV charging hardware and software provider Gemtek Goup for the trial.
Gemtek commercial manager Florian Popp said the company has tested a wide variety of power systems with its EV charging technologies and the solar-power VFRB is well suited for Australian conditions.
“The VSUN Energy storage system’s unique capabilities and operating life provide a substantial advantage in high temperature and remote environments,” he said.
VSUN said while the initial trial of the VFRB-based standalone charger had been a success, further installations will require initial testing prior to deployment.
