Last month Enel North America identified Oklahoma as the leading candidate for its new solar cell and module manufacturing facility, and that plan moved one step closer to fruition with a package voted on by the Oklahoma senate.
In a meeting of the joint appropriations committee, a package received initial approval that could give up to $180 million worth of taxpayer incentives. According to an article in The Oklahoman newspaper, the money would come out of leftover cash from its 2022 budget.
The facility, first announced in November 2022, will be operated through the company’s affiliate, 3Sun USA. Initial capacity of the solar cell and module factory is expected to be 3 GW, and Enel stated plans of doubling that capacity to 6 GW at the site. The facility is expected to bring millions of dollars of investment to the state and create more than 1,500 jobs, with production anticipated by late 2024. A stipulation in the bill is that at least 1,400 jobs must be created in order to receive the full amount of incentives.
The solar module factory would reportedly be built in the Tulsa Port of Catoosa, near the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation system. The port encompasses an area of 2,500 acres and is home to over 70 companies in its industrial park.
Enel Green Power North America is no newcomer to the state of Oklahoma. The company has twelve operating wind farms in the state, representing over 2 GW of operating capacity and $3 billion in investment in the state to date. Enel currently has a thirteenth wind farm, the Seven Cowboy Wind Project, under construction. Located in Washita and Kiowa counties, the wind project will have 107 wind turbines that will generate approximately 1.3 TWh of energy annually, equivalent to the electricity needs of over 120,000 U.S. households, and will avoid more than 758,000 tons of C02 emissions a year. The company also built a state-of-the-art training center in Oklahoma to train a workforce for the wind industry.
Senate Bill 1177 and two companion bills, reportedly in support of Enel’s solar factory, head next to the House and Senate floors for a final vote.
If approved, the proposed U.S. factory will be Enel’s second solar manufacturing facility, as it previously announced the expansion of its 3Sun Gigafactory in Catania, Sicily, increasing its production capacity from 200 MW to 3 GW. The U.S. factory will also be one of the few in the country manufacturing cells as well as modules.
Enel Green Power also manages more than 1,200 power plants on five continents with over 59 GW of installed renewable capacity from a mix of wind, solar, hydroelectric and geothermal.

It says the new device was specially designed for residential applications in the UK climate.
The Logic Air heat pump has a heating capacity of 8.2 kW or 10.3 kW, measures 1,095 mm x 518 mm x 1,008 mm, and weighs 110 kg. It is designed for new build and retrofit installations, working with both radiator and underfloor heating systems. The heat pump can also be paired with rooftop PV to maximize self-consumption.
The coefficient of performance (COP) is up to 5.19 for the 8.2 kW model and up to 4.9 for the 10.3 kW model, according to the company’s datasheet. The heat pump produces domestic hot water up to 55 C. Its seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) for heating water to 35 C varies between 5.16 and 5.19, while the SCOP for 55 C applications varies from 3.7 to 3.73.
“Taking the learnings from the award-winning Logic boiler, the Logic Air heat pump integrates seamlessly with UK homes, partnered with our best-in-class pre-plumbed hot water cylinder and our connected Halo Air room thermostat, the Logic Air is quick to install, easy to commission, and simple to use,” said Ideal.
It claims the Logic Air heat pump produces noise at 55 db(A), the equivalent of a normal conversation between two people. The new device uses R32 as the refrigerant with a charge of 1.47 kg. It has a global warming potential (GWP) of 675.
In April, Ideal Heating announced plans for a new GBP 10 million ($12.5 million) heat pump R&D research center in Hull, England.

The new solution is designed to address the higher quality requirements of n-type cells based on tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology, which demands a high-temperature process, lower resistivity, and lower oxygen content.
“Songci's SC-1600-LO₂ low-oxygen monocrystalline furnace is designed to remove oxygen impurities by matching the opening position of the furnace pipeline and the direction of the fluid pipeline through the thermal field process simulation,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The software control algorithm includes an oxygen control function module that turns on the oxygen removal function without affecting the crystal pulling.”
Songci Mechatronics claims that the new furnace can reduce the typical issue of concentric circles in n-type wafers by 50% and achieve an oxygen content reduction of more than 24% compared to mainstream wafers, which would, in turn, result in a 0.1% increase in cell efficiency.
In 2021, Songci Mechatronics received orders from JA Solar and Yuze Semiconductor as a new supplier of monocrystalline furnaces. In 2022, the company signed CNY 1.29 billion ($185.4 million) in new orders, up 667% year on year. The company says it expects new orders to reach CNY2 billion in 2023.

French startup Holosolis, a spinoff of EIT InnoEnergy, has revealed plans to build a module manufacturing facility in Hambach, near Sarreguemines, in northwestern France.
The location is the same as that of a now-abandoned factory project by Norwegian solar module manufacturer REC. It originally planned to build a 4 GW heterojunction panel factory there.
The new factory will have a capacity of 5 GW and will start commercial operations in 2027. Holosolis, which is currently based in Grenoble, said it had also considered other locations in Germany, Poland, Portugal and Spain for the project.
The company said it will invest €710 million ($772.1 million) in the new facility.

The research institute said the new IEC 63027 standard will replace the UL 1699B standard issued by Illinois-based certification body Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in 2011, when arc fault detectors became mandatory in the United States.
“The new IEC standard eliminates some of the weaknesses of the old US standard, which did not simulate real operation sufficiently,” the institute said. “As a result, many arcs went undetected, because they did not reach the alarm threshold values or because false alarms were triggered.”
According to the Fraunhofer ISE, undetected arcs and false tripping in solar inverters can be avoided only with a realistic test setup that uses an electronic DC source as a PV simulator instead of real PV modules. ” Current flows from the PV simulator into the inverter through a connection point that can be precisely disconnected,” Fraunhofer ISE experts explained.
“The connection point is a ball-and-socket joint made up of two tungsten electrodes, which are pulled apart at a defined speed, thus igniting a characteristic arc.”
The test setup also considers electrode distance and speed, while using a filter network between the inverter and the simulated PV system.
“The time until the inverter is switched off is decisive for the proper functioning of the arc detector: The less time an arc burns, the lower the energy input is into the faulty contact point, i.e., short switch-off times reliably prevent a fire from starting,” the scientists added, noting that arc fault detector successfully passes the test with energy values between 200 and 750 joules, switching off within 2.5 seconds. “Automatic reconnection after detector tripping is allowed four times within 24 hours. After the fifth time it must be reconnected manually.”
The institute said the new test bench is currently deployed at its TestLab Power Electronics, where it is already testing devices for DC voltages up to 1,500 V.
“We are expanding the range of services offered by our TestLab Power Electronics, where we perform accredited tests in accordance with grid codes, efficiency measurements and impedance spectroscopy investigations of inverters,” said Steffen Eyhorn, head of TestLab Power Electronics.

Flexcon aims to provide an alternative to the day-ahead market (DAM) and balancing market (BLM) for VREPs, who face penalties for system imbalances caused by the intermittent nature of their supply.
“Comparing the DAM price and BLM price, the lower price is applied when the VREP wants to sell its surplus of energy in the BLM, and the higher price is used when it wants to buy its shortage of energy in the BLM stage,” the Swedish group explained, noting that the dual-price imbalance system gives an incentive to VREPs to bid as accurately as possible.
The proposed contract allows VREPs and RETs to sell their power flexibility through a short-term bilateral approach facilitated by the Flexcon operator. Both parties provide their maximum exchangeable power flexibility, and VREPs can include their imbalances as a power flexibility source within the contract, priced between DAM and BLM prices. The Flexcon operator then determines the final price.
“The offer from VREP is considered a decision parameter in the RET’s decision-making problem,” they said, claiming that the bid from the RET is also a decision parameter from the VREP. “When it is negative, it means the VREP is willing to sell and when it is positive, it states that the VREP is willing to purchase.”
Based on multiple case studies, the researchers discovered that the proposed contract could potentially raise the expected profit of participants. VREPs may experience up to a 4.8% increase, while RETs could see a 7.15% increase.
“The effect of FlexCon on the parties’ profit is higher when the difference between the DAM price and the BLM price is higher,” they said. “The effect of FlexCon on the parties’ profit is higher when the uncertainty of maximum exchangeable power flexibility is higher.”
The researchers presented their findings in “A contract-based trading of power flexibility between a variable renewable energy producer and an electricity retailer,” which was recently published in Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/15/solar-for-microbreweries/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 15, 2023",Solar for microbreweries,"Researchers from Spain's Andalusian Association for Research and Industrial Cooperation (AICIA) have explored the use of solar power to enhance energy efficiency in two microbreweries in Andalusia, Spain.
“Combining the facts that brewing is an energy-intensive process; that small industries consume more specific energy; and that smaller consumers pay higher prices for energy, it can be hypothesized that small breweries and microbreweries are promising candidates for cost-effective integration of solar energy,” they said.
The scientists developed a new methodology to estimate microbrewery energy consumption and assess the economic viability of integrating it with a PV system. Their approach incorporates on-site measurements, evaluation of small-scale heat and cold supply components, and simulation tools to calculate the levelized cost of heat and cold (LCOHC) and payback period.
They analyzed a fully electric microbrewery equipped with a rooftop solar array across all 52 provinces of Spain. The study accounted for the thermal characteristics of the brewery's main building, heat in tanks and cold in fermenters, air conditioning and heat pumps, as well as PV generation.
To assess the PV installation's economic feasibility, the research group employed two parameters: the discounted payback period (DPP) and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). The group noted that for small and medium-sized enterprises, certain business accounting terms like depreciation, residual value, and corporate tax rate can be disregarded as their financial management resembles that of residential users rather than large corporations.
The analysis revealed that capex and electricity prices were the primary factors impacting the commercial viability of the solar power generator. The study assumed a maximum installed power of 20 kW with a ratio of 1/2 between the total PV area and total roof area.
“Electric storage has not been considered in the present study since the brewery requires to be connected to the main grid to ensure the electricity supply to the process, which compensates for the variability of the solar generation,” they explained, noting that they also assumed the PV system is operating under a net-billing scheme enabling the sale of excess power.
The techno-economic analysis showed that solar power could help reduce the LCOHC of a microbrewery in Spain by up to 29.7%, ranging from €0.285 ($0.31)/kWh to €0.332/kWh.
“The payback period might be suitable for companies’ investment horizon, ranging from 4.3 to 6.6 years,” the Spanish team said. “Extremely small PV system, of about 1 kWp, defines the shortest payback periods. Nevertheless, the improvement in the LCOHC is negligible in most cases, with reductions ranging between −0.8% and −3.21% compared to the corresponding reference LCOHC,” they stated.
They presented the new model in “Integration of solar energy in Small-scale Industries: Application to microbreweries,” which was recently published in Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments.

More than 110,000 Australian households could soon have access to AUD 1 billion in low‑interest loans to help make energy efficient upgrades to their homes as part of a new budget initiative, but the Master Electricians Australia (MEA) trade organization has called on the federal government to adopt a “holistic approach” when setting the loan criteria.
The AUD 1.3 billion Household Energy Upgrades Fund, announced as part of the 2023-34 federal budget, will provide households with access to discounted finance to increase sustainability across the housing sector, including through investment in energy efficiency upgrades, high-performing appliances and battery-ready PV.
The fund includes AUD 1 billion in discounted loans to help households install solar panels, replace gas hot-water system and stoves with electric alternatives, double-glaze their windows and undertake other energy efficiency measures. It will also provide AUD 300 million to support energy performance upgrades to social housing which will be co-funded and co-designed with the states and territories.
MEA Chief Executive Officer Malcolm Richards said while solar panels and high-efficiency electric hot water systems are worthy of support, new technologies are emerging that will potentially provide greater benefits to households and the nation.
Richards urged the government to consider supporting households to invest in bi-directional electric vehicle (EV) charging points that would allow people to draw electricity from their car batteries at peak times and charge them when demand for electricity is lower.
“Many areas of Australia already experience negative demand for solar power at the hottest part of the day, that is to say, we produce more power than we can use,” he said. “Funding additional solar panels alone will only add to this problem. We would like to see a holistic approach to this loan scheme, incorporating emerging technologies to maximise the benefits of green energy generation.”
Richards suggested the loan criteria for the Household Energy Upgrades Fund could be expanded to include battery energy storage solutions to help smooth that negative demand in the middle of the day, “by capturing excess electricity and making it available during the evening peak … But there’s no reason for the batteries to be fixed in one place. Within the next decade most Australians homes are expected to have at least one electric vehicle. Why not use that in-built battery as a power source for homes or offices?”
Richards said by adopting some “out-of-the-box thinking” with the energy upgrades fund, the federal government can not only help households, but can earn a dividend for the budget in the form of deferred spending in the years ahead.
While the final detail of the Household Energy Upgrades Fund is yet to be published, the AUD 1 billion scheme will be overseen by Clean Energy Finance Corp. (CEFC) which will work alongside private lenders to deliver the program. The scheme is expected to start next year.
The fund is part of a larger AUD 1.6 billion “energy savings plan” outlined in the budget. This includes AUD 314 million in tax deductions for businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million that invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/15/us-treasury-department-releases-guidance-on-domestic-solar-content/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 15, 2023",US Treasury Department releases guidance on domestic solar content,"From pv magazine USA
The US Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have released detailed information about the domestic content bonus under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Solar power projects that use domestic content are eligible for the full 30% tax credit can increase their tax credit by an additional 10%, to 40% in total, and 0.3 ¢/kWh for projects that use the Production Tax Credit.
The guidance allows developers to take advantage of the domestic content bonus credit for projects that begin construction this year. Additionally, the Treasury Department and the IRS intend to propose that the forthcoming proposed regulations will apply to taxable years ending after May 12, 2023.
According to the IRS, “domestic content is generally defined as steel, iron or manufactured products that are manufactured or produced in the United States.” The guidance also clarifies the treatment of labor costs, to ensure the focus of the incentive remains on domestic manufacturing.
To assist taxpayers in determining the applicable steel, iron or manufactured product standards, the Treasury Department and the IRS are providing a safe harbor for certain types of clean energy projects. The Treasury Department welcomes input on how manufactured components are classified.
“The domestic content bonus under the Inflation Reduction Act will boost American manufacturing, including in iron and steel, so America’s workers and companies continue to benefit from President Biden’s Investing in America agenda. These tax credits are key to driving investment and ensuring all Americans share in the growth of the clean energy economy,” said Janet L. Yellen, secretary of the Treasury.
In addition to meeting the domestic manufacturing requirements, to be eligible for the bonus credit, projects must also meet one of the following requirements: 1) the project has a maximum net output of less than 1 MW of energy; 2) construction of the project began before Jan. 29, 2023; or 3) the project satisfies the Inflation Reduction Act’s prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.
“Having clear rules of the road is imperative for businesses seeking to invest in America’s clean energy future, and the domestic content guidance that was just released from the Treasury Department provides helpful clarity. We are encouraged by Treasury’s solutions to meet the manufactured product test, which are consistent with recommendations from ACORE and others, and we look forward to projects moving forward under this guidance immediately,” said Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE).
More than $13 billion of new manufacturing investments have been announced to date, said the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
“This highly anticipated guidance from the Treasury Department is an important step forward and will spark a flood of investment in American-made clean energy equipment and components,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the SEIA. “The US solar and storage industry strongly supports onshoring a domestic clean energy supply chain, and today’s guidance will supplement the manufacturing renaissance that began when the historic Inflation Reduction Act passed last summer.”
In addition to the tax credits for clean energy developers, the Inflation Reduction Act provides incentives for the build out of US manufacturing, and it has effectively stimulated a number of companies to announce the intent to set up domestic manufacturing facilities.
SEIA estimates that the IRA will lead to 47 GW of new module manufacturing capacity, over 16 GW of cells, more than 16 GW of ingots and wafers, nearly 9 GWac of inverters and well over 100 GWh of battery manufacturing (which serves the solar as well as the electric vehicle industry). SEIA also estimates that we can anticipate more than 20,000 tons of annual domestic polysilicon capacity coming back online and a multitude of new investments in tracker and racking capacity. And this is just the start – SEIA forecasts that we will see exponential growth in all of these sectors.
