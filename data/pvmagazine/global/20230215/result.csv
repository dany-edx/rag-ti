Enteligent unveiled its DC-to-DC-solar hybrid bi-directional EV charger this week at Intersolar North America. Powered by the sun, the EV charger can supply 25 kW of fast DC charging, charging three times faster than AC Level 2 EV chargers, the company reports.
With most EV chargers, which are AC-to-DC, there is lost energy and a longer charging time. But with DC to DC, according to Enteligent, the DC-to-DC charging results in up to 25% energy savings because the power does not have to be converted.
The EV charger operates at 200 V to 500 V output for CCS Combo EV connectors, providing 15 kW of power over a 25-foot cable. Using stringed solar modules at 15 kW plus 15 kW of batteries, when combined with 9.6 kW of AC power saved from having to convert to DC, the charger provides a power output of 24.6 kW over a 400V system, the company reports.
“Rapid growth in EV ownership and usage and the resulting demand for energy are putting increased pressure on an already stretched electricity grid,” said Sean Burke, founder and CEO of Enteligent. “This first-of-its-kind technology will benefit consumers by enabling them to shift from night-time charging, which is dependent on the fossil-fuel powered grid, to clean, solar-based, daytime charging.”
Following the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the United States has supercharged its EV push. The IRA includes $10 billion in tax credits for a variety of manufacturing facilities, including EV and battery manufacturing facilities.
In total, between both laws there is at least $145 billion of funding for which EV charging projects could be eligible, said Atlas EV Hub, an analyst firm that has found that roughly $860 billion has been raised to build out EV manufacturing and charging infrastructure. Nearly one-fourth of this is represented by the United States, which has $210 billion in major automaker and infrastructure projects planned.
Earlier this month, Enteligent closed a $7 million growth funding round from NOVA, an affiliate of global building materials company Saint-Gobain and Taronga Ventures, among other early-stage investors. Founded in 2020, Enteligent is based in Morgan Hill, California, and including the round from NOVA and Taronga, has raised over $7.8 million in early-stage funding to date.
The company also sells NMax photovoltaic module power optimizers that the company says uses smart digital technology to dynamically adjust when to optimize and provide panel-level monitoring data, resulting in reportedly greater rooftop yield, more energy harvesting and higher system reliability. It is exhibiting in booth 2460 this week at Intersolar North America in Long Beach, California.

However, their widespread adoption has been limited for reasons such as the low performance of graphite felt, which is the most commonly used electrode in iron-chromium flow batteries.
Now a group of researchers from the University of Science and Technology Liaoning and the Yingkou Institute of Technology in China have developed a method to greatly improve the performance of the electrode, consequently increasing the energy efficiency of the flow battery by even up to 1.85 times.
They prepared cobalt oxide-modified graphite felt electrodes by electrodepositing cobalt nitrate on graphite felt, which was then calcined. They then analyzed this new electrode material with field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).
The researchers also explored the influence of different concentrations of cobalt oxide on the electrochemical performance of graphite felt as a flow battery electrode.
Their results showed that the method of calcination after electrodeposition successfully attaches cobalt oxide to the graphite felt fiber uniformly in granular form. It increases a large number of oxygen-containing functional groups, and significantly improves the performance of the iron-chromium redox flow battery, as well as its charging capacity and Coulombic efficiency.
Namely, the researchers found that the charging capacity at a current density of 140 mAcm−2 can reach up to 1.85 times that of the original graphite felt. The modified sample has a maximum Coulombic efficiency of 82 % at a high current density of 250 mAcm−2.
They discussed the results in “Research on the Performance of Cobalt Oxide Decorated Graphite Felt as Electrode of Iron-Chromium Flow Battery” which was recently published in Chemistry Europe.

PV Hardware (PVH), a unit of Spain-based PV developer Gransolar, has announced plans to build what it claims will be the world's largest tracker factory in Valencia, Spain.
The Spanish solar tracker manufacturer recently acquired a plot of land spanning more than 6 hectares as a location for the project. The factory is expected to raise the company's global annual tracker production capacity to 25 GW, PVH said, without providing more details about the new factory.
PVH's activities are currently divided across seven different locations in the Castilla industrial estate in Cheste, Spain. In the coming months, the company will build a tube factory with an investment of more than €20 million ($21.4 million).
It said that manufacturing its own products allows it to control the entire supply chain and offer its customers shorter delivery times, as we4ll as the ability to mitigate price variations due to market fluctuations.
The latest edition of pv magazine is devoted entirely to energy storage, with topics ranging from how battery suppliers can avoid supply-chain related policy risks, to the plans Russia hatched to be a hydrogen superpower – before it invaded Ukraine.
“PV Hardware's strategy has always been to continue growing,” said Emilio García, the COO of PVH. “At the moment we are the third supplier of solar trackers in the world, and our goal is to become the world's number one.”
PVH has another 8 GW of production capacity in Saudi Arabia and will open its first 6 GW factory in the United States in the months ahead. In 2022, it reported a turnover of more than €800 million and processed nearly 200,000 tons of steel in Cheste.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/15/australia-regretting-belated-transition-as-ira-sparks-global-race-for-renewables/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,EUROPE,UNITED STATES",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 15, 2023",Australia regretting belated transition as IRA sparks global race for renewables,"From pv magazine Australia
US President Joe Biden signed the $369 billion Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law in August 2022 and changed the face of the global energy transition.
The IRA is the largest climate and energy spending package in US history. The bill not only expands incentives to deploy clean energy toward emission-reduction goals, but includes new production incentives for domestic solar, wind and battery manufacturing.
Much like Australia, political polarization in the United States delayed clear policies to mitigate climate change and drive the transition to renewables. But now the sleeping giant has awoken and sparked an international clean energy arms race that few, if any, will be able to keep up with.
In a period of global energy crisis and a decade of desperation when it comes to concrete action to mitigate the effects of climate change, the IRA is a cause to rejoice.
“It is immediately clear the US package dwarfs the level of support Australian governments provide for the clean energy transition,” said Australian Clean Energy Council Chief Executive Kane Thornton. “The consequences of inaction have the potential to damage Australian competitiveness across all industries for decades to come.”
European leaders have made a similar realization. After years bemoaning the lack of climate leadership from the United States without making significant moves of its own, the European Union is now bemoaning the US having taken the lead. In early February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded to the IRA with the $272 billion Green Deal Industrial Plan.
“We only have a small window to invest in clean technology and innovation and to become leaders before the fossil fuel economy is over,” said von der Leyen.
The clean energy policy arms race sparked by the IRA means governments around the world can no longer excuse their inaction by pointing to the action of major emitters like the United States and China. But now that excuse no longer holds. Indeed, pv magazine has learned of rumors in China that the government is looking to ramp up PV installations from 122 GW in 2022 to around 160 GW in 2023.
Thornton noted that US spending is positive for decarbonization, but said he recognized that US incentives mean Australia now faces losing thousands of jobs and significant international investment to its closest ally.
“Australia has a prime opportunity to become a clean energy superpower,” said Thornton. “But the brightest minds and the biggest wallets are now looking to the US for their best opportunity.”
Thornton is calling for the Australian federal government to respond to the IRA in its May budget with a coherent masterplan and vast economic investment to prioritize the construction of renewable energy and storage, or risk dropping even further behind.
Ryan Carroll, a regional director at STEM workforce solutions provider Airswift, said the Australian government should “learn from Joe Biden and use the May budget to promote investment and entrepreneurship. This will signal to the top energy minds that Australia is the place for career progression and innovative projects.”
Make or break
The Covid-19 pandemic and its run-on impacts throughout global supply chains demonstrated the benefits of domestic manufacturing. But now IRA incentives are attracting global manufacturers to the United States, and the likes of Australia and Europe are learning, as Shakespeare put it, that “delays have dangerous ends.”
Nevertheless, Australia’s long-dormant clean energy manufacturing industry is showing small signs of life. The government’s proposed National Reconstruction Fund (NRF) aims to boost investment in inshore manufacturing, including the production of solar panels, batteries and hydrogen electrolyzers, and is now on the verge of parliament. The government has earmarked up to AUD 3 billion ($2.07 billion) of the NRF’s initial AUD 15 billion to support renewables and low-emission technologies.
US-based solar tracker provider Array Technologies recently announced plans to set up manufacturing operations in Australia. In July 2022, Australia’s sole solar panel manufacturer, Tindo Solar, unveiled a new AUD 11 million production facility in Adelaide. And in December, Tindo announced a doubling of sales in both panels and battery storage. The company said the boost came off the back of rising energy costs and increased consumer awareness of the benefits of buying quality and buying locally.
While there are critics who argue the IRA is a protectionist policy that will trigger a “race to the bottom,” in which governments compete with more favorable incentives to attract clean energy manufacturers and multinational companies. few could argue the pre-IRA status quo was much better.
In fact, judging by the international reaction, the IRA is already proving beneficial in kicking laggardly governments and investors into gear. The United States has ignited the race for green power, and now it's make or break time for trade blocs like the European Union and trade partners like Australia.

It said the standard ALK Hi1 electrolyzer can achieve an energy content of 4.3 kWh per normal cubic meter (Nm3) with a full-load DC power source. It claimed that its ALK Hi1 Plus version can achieve an energy content of 4.1 kWh/Nm3, or even as low as 4.0 kWh/Nm3, at a current density of 2500 A/m2.
Li Can, a researcher from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said that electrolyzers now on the market can achieve an average energy content of 4.5-4.6 kWh/Nm3.
“If renewable energy can deliver power at around CNY0.2 ($0.03)/kWh, Longi's electrolyzer can produce hydrogen at CNY1 per cubic meter which is close to hydrogen from coal,” he said.
Longi Hydrogen said the new ALK Hi1 series can directly reduce 10% of DC electricity use in hydrogen generation, for a levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) reduction of between 1.8% to 2.2%.
“This compensates for between 10% to 25% of the initial investment,” the company said.
Longi Hydrogen said its ALK Hi1 line has been tested and certified by third-party authorities such as Det Norske Veritas and Dekra. Representatives from Wanhua Chemical and China National Energy (CHN Energy) participated in the new product release.

SolarEdge Technologies, an Israel-based inverter specialist, has reported record revenues of $890.7 million for the full year to Dec. 31, 2022, with $837 million coming from the solar segment. Shipments in 2022 amounted to 14 GW of inverters and 6 MWh of batteries. The company said its revenue of $3.11 billion rose 58% year over year from 2021.
Th company recently announced that its energy storage division had begun shipping battery cells for stationary energy storage applications from its Sella 2 gigafactory in South Korea. It began shipments of nickel manganese cobalt pouch cells optimized for energy storage applications in the residential, commercial and utility-scale segments.
“The global economic and geopolitical events coupled with post pandemic dynamics created an unprecedented demand for solar energy in general and our products in particular,” said Zvi Lando, chief executive officer of SolarEdge.
For the first quarter of 2023, the company expects revenues to fall within the range of $915 million to $945 million. It expects revenues from the solar segment to be within the range of $875 million to $905 million, and a gross margin from the solar segment of 31% to 34%.

It uses excess heat from PV modules to provide heating in buildings.
“Our system produces more than 20,000 kWh per 100 m² of roof space and the modular design enables quicker, cheaper installation,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “We are currently producing the panels at our main British manufacturing hub in Essex, but we also manufacture them in Italy, the Netherlands, and the US.”
The VirtuPVT system features an absorber plate, monocrystalline PERC solar cells, a borosilicate vacuum tube, an integrated reflector, and an integrated mounting system. The absorber plate is an extrusion heat plate with high–aspect copper channels to promote turbulent heat transfer. It minimizes thermal losses, as it uses excess heat generated in the PV cells, and reportedly generates heat at up to 80 C. That heat can be transferred into buildings via 8 mm pipes connected to a 22 mm manifold with DN16 connectors. 
The manufacturer said the integrated reflectors enable the system to harvest 40% more energy compared to conventional PV and the rotating collectors can optimize performance on pitched roofs, flat roofs, and vertical facades. A single tube unit measures 2,165 mm x 300 mm x 265 mm and weighs 19.9 kg. Its aperture area is 0.64 m2 and the absorber area is 0.324 m2. Its peak thermal output is 275 W and the electrical output is 70 W.
“The vacuum tube minimizes thermal losses to the atmosphere, which results in high system efficiency even in cold weather,” the spokesperson stated. “Its compact size makes it perfect for urban settings with high heat demand but limited roof space and makes it perfect for retrofitting into pre-existing solar installations.”
The manufacturer said the system does not requires any traditional racking and is usually deployed at a height of just 26 cm from the roof line, due to the integrated mounting structure. Its design purportedly reduces wind shear, while eliminating the need for using ballast or piercing roof membrane.
“VirtuPVT underwent a successful pre–certification test program at TÜV Rheinland, and is now being type tested under ISO9806, EN61215 and EN61730,” the spokesperson added. “Our system also requires low maintenance and is backed by a warranty of up to 10 years.”
Naked Energy recently set up several distribution partnerships with companies operating in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and the United States.

A California water irrigation district has launched Project Nexus, which is installing a 4 MW solar canopy on an irrigation canal in California.
ESS Inc., a saltwater energy storage system manufacturer, has announced the delivery of an Energy Warehouse system to the Turlock Irrigation District in central California. The energy storage company will deploy a few Energy Warehouse containers to pair with solar panels over irrigation canals.
Project Nexus intends to generate clean energy while conserving water resources in an increasingly arid California environment. It selected the Energy Warehouse for its safe and non-toxic characteristics, which makes it ideal for siting adjacent to water infrastructure. Funding for the Turlock project is provided by the state of California.
The solar-plus-storage project will shade canals with solar panels, a process that will reduce evaporative losses while generating clean energy. Recent research by the University of California, Merced, shows the potential for 13 GW of solar capacity to be installed over California canals, which could necessitate about 3 GW of energy storage systems and contribute to the state’s clean energy and water conservation goals.
“This project addresses multiple climate challenges at once and is the kind of innovative approach that will build a climate-resilient future,” said Hugh McDermott, senior vice president, business development and sales at ESS. “We look forward to delivering a solution that can be replicated across California and other drought-prone areas.”
Turlock’s initial solar-plus-storage project is set to be complete in 2024. ESS says its iron flow technology provides long-duration energy storage and is designed for applications that require up to 12 hours of flexible energy capacity. The company reports that its non-toxic flow battery has a 25-year design life without capacity fade.

This implies that all fossil energy sources are to be faded out as quickly as possible.
A key motivation for a fast transition to electricity is that efficiency levels are two to three times higher than the fossil-based energy system. This will drive strong growth in electricity consumption and encourage a fast switch from fossil-based power stations (gas, oil) to renewable energy systems. Wind and solar will provide the lion’s share, as they have the lowest costs of production and the highest potential by far.
However, wind and solar are weather and season-dependent variable renewable energy resources (VREs). Implementing them at levels of ultra-high grid penetration requires their transformation from intermittent to firm resources that are permanently available to meet demand, 24/7 and 365  days a year.
A growing body of work shows that the central enabler of this transformation is implicit storage, which means overbuilding the VREs and dynamically curtailing them operationally. Substantiated by several in-depth case studies, we infer that close to 100% VRE power grids firmly supplying clean power and meeting constant demand are not only possible, but would be economically viable, provided that VRE resources are optimally transformed from unconstrained run-of-the weather generation into firm generation sources.
VREs are capable of entirely displacing all conventional sources economically. Grid-forming inverter technology is now emerging, which resolves any grid frequency and stability issues resulting from the replacement of conventional rotating power generation.
The enabling technologies needed to transform VREs from variable to firm generation already exist. They include energy storage, the optimum blending of VREs and other renewable resources, geographic dispersion, and supply/demand flexibility. Most importantly the transformation entails overbuilding and operationally curtailing the VREs (aka implicit storage). This strategy ensures acceptable total VRE production costs, which include both generation and grid integration cost.
The results of the different studies, summarized in an IEA-PVPS report, demonstrate that proactive curtailment will be an important part of the solution. In Switzerland, scenarios of a 100% renewable electricity grid mix were analyzed to determine the financially optimal usage of curtailment for the PV electricity fraction. It was shown that 10% to 40% of PV energy curtailment is optimal, leading to levelized costs of energy (LCOE) values of €0.07 ($0.08)/kWh to €0.09/kWh.
The more electrically integrated Switzerland is with the European electricity system, the less implicit storage is needed. But importantly, scenarios with restricted electricity import would lead to acceptably low LCOE in the range of €0.09/kWh due to the concept of implicit storage. In a pan-European evaluation, approximately 30% energy curtailment is optimal leading to an LCOE of €0.029/kWh including hydrogen storage. For the region of the US Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) an optimum of 35% curtailment is reached with 80% PV and 20% wind – leading to an LCOE of $0.042/kWh.
Curtailment has been historically considered as something that must be avoided and minimized. However, this must be judged differently today. One major conclusion of the International Energy Agency work is that curtailment is a prerequisite of energy transition and will lower the total costs of transition significantly. Storage will be an important part in the future. But storing or transforming every possible kilowatt-hour of PV would simply be too expensive.
This enabler cannot be immediately implemented and monetized because renewable power regulations enabling firm power remuneration vehicles for producers at any scale (from residential to utility scale) do not yet exist. Urgent regulatory reform is needed and VRE production support schemes must be revisited. If no changes are made to support schemes to enable the firm power concept, the result will be much higher overall costs for the energy transition.

In September 2022, the regulator proposed replacing the current national average power purchase price of PKR 19.32/kWh with the national average energy purchase price of PKR 9/kWh for net-metered households that inject excess electricity into the grid. The measure would have affected 20,700 households.
After public consultation, the public and consumers “strongly opposed the proposed amendments, citing reasons that electricity through net metering is one of the most efficient methods and the proposed amendment in the regulations would discourage net metering/solar installation,” Nepra said in an official statement about its decision to reverse the proposed amendments.
In the same statement, Nepra argued that electricity generated through rooftop solar should be mainly for self-consumption and “not for commercial sale.” However, it conceded that electricity from net-metered households represents less than 1% of the national distributor’s electricity purchases.
“The economic benefits of net metering in terms of displacement of costlier electricity, savings of foreign exchange and incurring minimal losses, cannot be ignored,” it added.
In September, Afia Malik, a senior research economist for the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), told pv magazine that she expects just 23 MW of excess electricity to be exported into the grid by the affected net-metered households.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/15/how-safe-are-second-life-ev-batteries-as-home-energy-storage-devices/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UNITED KINGDOM",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 15, 2023",How safe are second-life EV batteries as home energy storage devices?,"A UK government study has revealed opposing views on the safety of second-life EV batteries in home energy storage applications. Some stakeholders argue that an enabling framework is possible, while others contend that the safety of such devices “can never be guaranteed.”
The independent research report, “A Study on the Safety of Second-life Batteries in Battery Energy Storage Systems,” was commissioned by the UK Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) and was produced by academics at Newcastle University’s School of Engineering.
As part of the project, the researchers consulted around 40 organizations and companies, including global safety and certification organization UL, major manufacturers such as Siemens and Varta, and automakers such as Nissan and Jaguar. While a number of these stakeholders use second-life LiBs, predominantly for industrial applications, “evidence suggests there is currently limited use in domestic systems,” according to the report.
However, extensive discussions have shown that a number of respondents believe that a safety framework can be put in place to allow the use of second-life LiBs in home battery storage applications, so long as the full history of the batteries in their first-life applications is known and/or they can be tested effectively.
A second, more radical view shared by some stakeholders is simply that the safety of such cells can never be guaranteed, “and hence that second-life LiBs should not be employed under any circumstances in such applications.”
In the concluding remarks, the report adds that consideration should also be given to whether stricter requirements are needed for home-built energy storage systems which use second-life batteries.
This is explained by the lack of knowledge around age-related failures and their effects. Namely, whereas the hazards associated with second-life LiBs are broadly the same, the probability of failure may be higher with the former due to the effects of aging and unknown stress, or abuse during an LiB's first-life application.
Specifically, the capacity loss of LiBs is generally considered to be linear, with end of life typically around 75% to 80% state of health (SoH) and the final end-of-life stage around 50% to 60% SoH. However, at some point a severe and potentially dangerous deterioration can occur and lead to an increased aging rate. The time at which this occurs, referred to as the “knee,” is difficult to predict. It can occur at a higher SoH than expected, thereby increasing the risk of thermal runaway, internal short circuits, and joule heating, according to the report.
The report goes on to state that there is currently no widely accepted testing methodology to assess the safety of second-life LiBs, leaving a major gap in international standards.
“It is currently both costly and labor intensive to test and triage end of life batteries due to a lack of standardization among EV OEMs,” reads the report. “In addition, the falling cost of new LiBs means the economic incentive for reuse and repurposing may become less attractive.”
