Solar module shipments to the U.S. appear to have been detained by Customs and Border Protection agents as part of an enforcement action aimed at banning the import of solar equipment containing components provided by a Chinese company suspected of using forced labor.
Roth Capital Partners said that JinkoSolar had around 100 MW of product detained by border agents. The analyst said that Jinko may not ship hundreds of megawatts of capacity to the U.S. as long as the customs inquiry is in process.
Canadian Solar also was said to have had four testing samples detained, and Trina Solar may have had six testing samples detained in July.

The government said it has based its approach on previous success with offshore wind, mentioning the contracts for difference (CfD) incentive scheme as central. “As such, the government has today launched a public consultation on a preferred hydrogen business model which, built on a similar premise to the offshore wind CfDs, is designed to overcome the cost gap between low-carbon hydrogen and fossil fuels.” The government is also consulting on a £240 million (€282 million) Net Zero Hydrogen Fund to support the commercial deployment of new “low carbon hydrogen production plants.”  The government also presented a £105 million (€123 million) funding package through a Net Zero Innovation Portfolio for industrial uses; £55 million for an Industrial Fuel Switching Competition, £40 million (€47 million) for a Red Diesel Replacement Competition, for the construction, quarrying and mining sectors; and £10 million for an Industrial Energy Efficiency Accelerator.
Blue hydrogen, powered by natural gas facilities equipped with carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology is at the heart of the strategy. The British government said it wants to support multiple technologies by collaborating with the industry. “While we welcome positive steps like the new Net Zero Hydrogen Fund, overall, the strategy doesn’t focus nearly enough on developing the U.K.’s world-leading green hydrogen industry,” said Dan McGrail, CEO of clean energy industry body RenewableUK. The government published the plans ahead of the COP26 climate change meeting planned in Glasgow at the end of the year. According to government analysis, 20-35% of the U.K.’s energy consumption by 2050 could be hydrogen-based. The government added, it would be launching a “hydrogen sector development action plan” early next year.
Analysts have given a mixed response to the plans. “The government’s goal of 5 GW of low-carbon hydrogen production for 2030 may not position the country as a leader in the sector,” said Barbara Monterrubio, energy transition analyst at London-based GlobalData. The analyst has already tracked the equivalent of 4.6 GW in proposed hydrogen projects. In that sense, the plans seem reasonable but not hugely ambitious. Monterrubio said, for instance, “the Netherlands and Germany … already have 15 GW and 14 GW of respective projects in the pipeline.”
The U.K. government confirmed its ambition for 5 GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 but the strategy at present features only pilot projects and debate is continuing over the role hydrogen can play in residential heating. “The U.K. in particular has seen a lot of lobbying for hydrogen in the residential sector by gas incumbents but the national strategy released today sees a limited role,” tweeted Gniewomir Flis, from the German Agora Energiewende thinktank. Michael Liebreich, founder of BloombergNEF, said the plans are solid. “I think the U.K. hydrogen strategy is beautifully judged on heating,” he said. “Sixty-seven thousand homes by 2030 is enough to reveal the economics in all their glory; meanwhile, aspiring to reach 10% of domestic heating by 2035 is fine, even though it probably won't happen,” he tweeted.
Thierry Breton, European commissioner for the internal market, has written a LinkedIn post supporting hydrogen as a driver of the EU’s “green revolution.” Breton said the EU must address strategic dependencies, which in the hydrogen case means “having access to critical raw materials and securing the availability of large amounts of decarbonized electricity.” The French businessman and politician underlined the potential role of nuclear in the sector. “In the short to medium-term, other forms of low-carbon hydrogen are needed, including based on nuclear energy,” he added. “Nuclear energy is available, steady and abundant. We could use this transitional energy to facilitate the deployment of a clean hydrogen industry in Europe.” Breton suggests disconnecting the reactors from the grid and using the energy for electrolyzers.
The European Union wants to unveil projects before COP26 with Breton writing: “The objective is to present a pipeline of investment projects during the upcoming Hydrogen Forum in November, based on the project proposals we collected this spring.” The commissioner said development banks and other institutions working with the EU would play a key role in financing projects, a development defined as “another challenge, notably for smaller companies.” Last month, the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development teamed up with the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine to promote the development and use of hydrogen. EU lender the European Investment Bank is also very active in the sector.
Breton said he supported the ongoing political and commercial process which will lead to the definition of important projects of common European interest, including country-led hydrogen projects showcasing nationally-available expertise and proposing plans for hydrogen clusters. Apart from financial support, the commissioner said the EU is working on other measures. “New, EU-wide certification systems and targets for the deployment of refueling stations for hydrogen are proposed,” he said. “The Energy Taxation Directive also sets preferential tax rates for the use of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen for end-consumers. Later this year, we will complement this package with a review of EU legislation on gas markets, which I believe … will reinforce the momentum for hydrogen deployment.”

The French state development agency has given the cash to the Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited to back green power and energy efficiency projects in the South Asian nation.
The Economic Relations Division of Bangladesh's Ministry of Finance announced the funding boost by stating rural SMEs and co-operatives would be prioritized for funding.
The infrastructure fund, which has already backed a 20 MW solar project, also has $150 million from the Japan International Cooperation Agency to draw upon.
Asif Ahmed Khan, a principal officer at the state-run body, said the fund contributes loans charged at around 6% interest to cover up to 70% of the cost of green spending with investors fronting up the balance.
The French development agency has been providing loans in Bangladesh since 2012, focusing on the development of energy facilities, infrastructure, water, sanitation, and the environment. For instance, the AFD has previously provided €50 million to Bangladesh's large garment manufacturing industry for investments into workplace safety, the environment and social projects.
Bangladesh sources around 3.3% of its electricity from a renewables fleet amounting to 767 MW of generation capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/17/cooling-pv-modules-with-plants-coir-pith/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA,MALAYSIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 17, 2021","Cooling PV modules with plants, coir pith","An Indian-Malaysian group of scientists has conducted a review of several passive cooling techniques applied to PV modules and has found that two systems, based on coir pith and plants, provide the strongest improvement in terms of power yield.
Five techniques were tested by the researchers on a south-oriented, 50 W polycrystalline module with a tilt angle of 15 degrees located in Kumbakonam, in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. They were: placing domestic plants around the panels at a distance of around 10cm; using a greenhouse net placed on top of the panels to prevent overexposure to sunlight; a combination of plants and the greenhouse net; placing water-soaked coir pith underneath the panels; and using phase change materials (PCMs).
The measurements were taken through an infrared thermometer from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and the performance of the five settings was compared with that of a reference panel without cooling assistance. “The overall uncertainty in the analysis is within 2%, based on the accuracy and precision of the instrument used,” the academics specified.
The panel without cooling showed an average voltage of 17.8 V and, with the cooling techniques, this value ranged from 18.1 V to 20.3 V. The highest value and, as a result, the best performance in terms of power yield, was provided by coir pith, which the academics attributed to its moisture-retaining property. The combination of plants and greenhouse net resulted in the second-best performance, at 20 V, followed by PCM cooling and plant cooling, which offered the third and fourth-best results, at 19.8 V and 19.3 V, respectively. The greenhouse net alone was able to generate 18.1 V, which is slightly higher than the module without cooling. “This can be attributed to the fact that the greenhouse maintained temperature and did not allow more sunlight to pass through it,” the research team explained.
The measurements also showed that the average power output of the module without cooling was 32.6 W and that the panes with cooling achieved values between 10.82 W and 36.38 W. This gap was explained by the academics as caused by current variations caused by the cooling systems. “For coir pith cooling, the average output power was 36.38 W,” they emphasized. “When the combination of greenhouse and plant cooling was employed, the average output power was 19.59 W.”
The strongest improvement for the module power yield – 11.34% – was achieved with coir cooling, while plant cooling, which uses air as the medium of coolant, delivered the second-best result with a 7.34% increase in power.  The maximum reduction in the module operational temperature – 14 degrees Celsius – was achieved by the combination of plants with a greenhouse net while the greenhouse net alone was able to reduce the temperature by 12 degrees Celsius. “The coir cooling technique provided maximum power improvement along with the optimum temperature reduction,” the scientists added. “Plant cooling techniques provided better temperature regulation along with considerable power enhancement, compared to the uncooled PV module.”
The review of the passive cooling techniques can be found in the paper Sustainable passive cooling strategy for PV module: A comparative analysis, published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering. The research team is formed by scientists from the Sastra Deemed University in India and the Universiti Malaysia Pahang, in Malaysia. The latter published an extensive review on all passive and cooling techniques applied to photovoltaics in October. That study presented active techniques including air-based cooling, liquid-based cooling, forced water circulation, liquid immersion cooling, water spraying, and passive methods such as PCM cooling, heat pipes, heat sink or fins and heat exchangers, microchannel heat exchangers, radiative sky cooling, nano-fluid based cooling, thermoelectric cooling, evaporative cooling, and spectrum filter cooling.

The difficulty of identifying suitable surfaces has pushed developers to become creative. For example, Slovenian hydropower plant operator HESS announced plans in December to build a 6 MW solar park close to its 47.7 MW Brežice hydroelectric plant on the lower reaches of the Sava River.
It is building the facility on the right bank of the river between a grove and an embankment, 3 km upstream from the hydropower plant. “It is a sediment dump area, measuring approximately 9 hectares. And the solar power plant will cover 6 hectares,” the company said at the time.
A similar project is now being constructed by Dravske elektrarne Maribor, a renewable energy producer owned by Slovenia-based power utility Holding slovenske elektrarne (HSE). Last week, Dravske elektrarne Maribor began workong on a 2.7 MW ground-mounted PV plant in Zlatolicje, a village on the right bank of the Drava River, southeast of Maribor in the northeastern part of the country.
The €2 million ($2.4 million) solar park is being deployed on a slope of the left bank of the drainage canal at the Zlatolicje hydroelectric power plant, which accounts for more than one-fifth of all the electricity generated by Dravske elektrarne Maribor. The plant is expected to generate 3,000 MWh per year and is the first section of a 30 MW solar park that will be further expanded at a later stage. The company said it is also building a 3 MW solar plant on the Prapretno waste landfill near Hrastnik, in the Central Sava Valley in central Slovenia.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Slovenia's total installed PV capacity stood at just 267 MW by the end of 2020, on new annual additions of just 3 MW. Most of its existing capacity comes from rooftop PV installed in 2012 (122 MW), 2011, (54 MW) and 2010 (37 MW) under the national feed-in tariff scheme, which expired at the end of 2013.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/17/new-pv-facade-design-in-sweden/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 17, 2021",New PV facade design in Sweden,"Soltech Energy, a Swedish PV system integrator and solar product supplier, is building several PV facades in its home market. It recently installed a 60 kW solar facade on a newly built garage with 300 EV–charging posts in Gothenburg by adopting a special design it has developed for buildings with particular airflow patterns.
The flow of air in the garage is important because of exhaust from the vehicles. The facade is open so the air exchange does not need to be measured, as it is far beyond the required levels for garages, according to the company. It also claims that the air flow is beneficial for the temperature of the panels.
“The facade is being built with semi-transparent modules that requires a certain tilt angle and, at the same time, it is placed on a building wall that needs a high exchange of airflow between its inner and outer parts,” the company's chief innovation officer, Anna Svensson, told pv magazine. “For these reasons, we decided to use a prefabricated, 11-meter hot-dipped galvanized steel construction built by our unit Fasadsystem, which allows the deployment of the panels with the required tilt angle before the structure is attached to the wall, and also the necessary air passages for the garage walls through interstices present between the horizontal rows of panels.“

This structure and module configuration, according to Svensson, facilitate easy, high-quality, fast installations, as it only took about a month and a half to install and put the garage project into operation. It also ensures that, from approximately 2 meters away, only the color of the solar panels is visible, although thin black lines are also visible from close up.
“The glass is not chromatic and the thin black lines are the solar substrate but you only see them standing at a distance lower than two meters and if you are further away you only see one color on the entire panel,” Svensson explained. “The technique to create the visual impact is very old for normal patterns and is called ‘raster graphics'.”
Svensson said that the client, Swedish property company Wallenstam, wanted the area to be inspired by patterns and colors of Swedish designer Viola Gråsten, who helped popularize brightly colored rya pile carpets in the 1950s. Raster graphics are digital images created with tiny rectangular pixels arranged in a grid formation. They are usually built with chromatic gradations, different lines and shapes, and complex compositions.

The grid-connected solar facade supplies electricity for the garage, which features approximately 300 charging boxes for electric cars. The system includes 1,096 semi-transparent glass-glass frameless panels with 40% transparency and a power output of 54 kW. Chinese manufacturer Advanced Solar Power supplied the modules. The modules measure 1,200 mm x 600 mm x 6.8 mm and weigh 11.8 kg, with a total surface of 0.72 square meters. The thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar panels are available in red, blue, orange, and green. 
Svensson said the PV facade concept can be compared to any decor facade. “You can have it at a garage as an open facade, but you can also have it on a building as a decor facade and then add a closed facade behind,” she said.
*The article was updated on August 18 to reflect that the PV facade has a capacity of 60 kW.

The benchmarking against coal applies for all new utility scale projects as well as commercial, distributed generation arrays, Xinyi stated, as it reported stellar six-month returns and a doubling of its dividend.
Shareholders are set to receive HK$0.17 (US$0.02) per share although the message from the Xinyi board was ‘enjoy it while it lasts,' amid predictions a solar glass price described as “plummeting” during the April-to-June period will cause “challenging” conditions for the rest of the year.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out now. Pick up your copy today for an in-depth look at batteries big and small; how they’re changing and how they’re changing the world. What do batteries really have in store for us? The August print edition of pv magazine global has answers to the big questions surrounding the battery energy storage revolution.
Xinyi's first-half figures, which the company described as “spectacular revenue and profit growth” included profits attributable to shareholders more than doubling, from HK$1.4 billion (US$180 million) in January-to-June last year, to HK$3.07 billion (US$394 million) this time around.
The numbers went in the right direction almost entirely across the board as the solar glass price continued to soar in the first three months of this year.
However the board noted prices began to reverse that trend in the last quarter, as rapid expansions in production capacity across the industry – driven by shortages of solar panel glass last year – coincided with arrested demand caused by the knock-on effect of those price rises, coupled with a soaring polysilicon price.
That has seen pressure on solar glass pricing since March, with Xinyi reporting the price of mainstream, 3.2mm solar glass fell more than 45% in the first half of the year.
The polysilicon price, said Xinyi, “generally stabilized or even started to decrease” last month.
Pricing pressure could delay or even halt glass production capacity expansion plans for Xinyi's rivals, the company said, although Xinyi itself said its plans were unchanged. The company started trial production runs at three of its four new 1,000 ton-per-day-melting-capacity lines in Wuhu, in Anhui province, in January, March and last month, and expects to fire up the fourth line next month.
Another eight 1,000-ton lines are due to be completed next year, with four in Jiangsu province's Zhangjiagang and four more in Wuhu; and a further eight lines have already been planned for Wuhu, with their installation timelines to be determined.
Xinyi last week announced a glass sales agreement with solar giant Longi which will see the Chinese module manufacturer purchase at least 35% of its annual demand from the glassmaker at prices determined on a monthly basis. Xinyi said the arrangement would start next month and run until at least the end of 2025, with the option of a rolling three-year contract built in to the agreement.

The facility is expected to begin manufacturing activities within six months and to serve the company's cell and module assembly factories in Malaysia, as well as the module assembly facility in the United States.
The manufacturer said planning on the 7 GW factory started in late 2020, with the Vietnamese government giving the approval for the project in March 2021. “The investment decision was made in the second half of last year, prior to the ongoing trade issue with the United States,” it told pv magazine, responding to Vietnamese media articles claiming the new factory is being built to diversify the company's supply chain away from China and as an answer to new requirements from western countries and suppliers.
The trade issue referred to by JinkoSolar relates to the alleged use of forced labor in China's Xinjiang province. The U.S. government announced it wants to ban products from four Xinjiang-based solar manufacturers over those allegations in late June. JinkoSolar was not among the companies named at the time.
The module manufacturer also stressed that the new factory is part of its plan to diversify its production globally. “While overseas supply chains are often associated with slightly higher costs, this investment is expected to assuage concerns by developers and off-takers about the security of supply – an invaluable asset for one of the largest solar module manufacturers in the world,” it further explained.

The Spanish minister for the ecological transition and the demographic challenge, Teresa Ribera, announced yesterday that today a new auction for 3.3 GW of renewable energy capacity will be launched.
“The aim is to continue auctioning renewable energies … and to continue facilitating the transformation of the electrical system in an orderly manner,” she said, after a meeting with the president of the Menorca Island Council, Susana Mora, and with the island's board of mayors.
“On this occasion, we want to get a significant percentage of renewable wind energy [and] another percentage dedicated to photovoltaics, but with two peculiarities that are the result of learning from the requests of these months,” she added, noting that there will be an “ultra-fast” quota of 600 MW for small scale projects.
In the last renewables auction held in Spain, in January, the government allocated a total of 3.034 GW of clean energy capacity at an average price of €24.47/MWh ($29.62). The capacity allocations included 2.036 GW of solar PV and 998 MW of wind energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/17/electric-vehicle-race-heats-up/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"AUGUST 17, 2021",Electric vehicle race heats up,"From pv magazine 08/2021
Battery electric vehicles (EVs) will be the dominant form of road transport by 2050, accounting for 56% of all vehicle sales that year. Our research indicates that in 2050, we will see 875 million electric passenger vehicles, 70 million electric commercial vehicles, and 5 million fuel cell vehicles on the roads. This brings the grand total of zero-emissions vehicles in operation to 950 million by mid-century.
Additionally, more than three out of every five vehicles will be EVs in China, Europe, and the U.S. by 2050. And almost one in two commercial vehicles will be electric by the same date in those regions.
The projected growth in EV sales spells bad news for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Sales of ICE vehicles, including micro/mild hybrids, will fall to under 20% of all global sales by 2050. Almost half of the remaining ICE stock will reside in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, Russia and the Caspian region, despite those markets only possessing a combined 18% of global vehicle stock that year.

Policies of net-zero are transforming the global landscape. Transport is one of the largest contributors to emissions, as well as one of the lowest-hanging fruits. Countries accounting for more than 50% of global car sales and automakers representing 80% of global sales have expressed a desire to be carbon neutral, and many have laid out concrete plans to do so.
With new supply chains and new dependencies, traditional OEMs are innovating with their business models. The stage seems set for an overhaul of road transport, but with OEMs making frequent, flashy EV announcements, the question of how, when, where, and who is subject to debate.
The top five Wood Mackenzie projected EV automakers – Tesla, Volkswagen, General Motors, Nissan-Renault, and Hyundai – have committed to a combined 8.9 million in annual sales of battery EVs by 2030, or nearly 50% of our projected global battery EV sales. The companies will hit 39% of their target by this date, with Tesla’s ambition of 20 million annual sales by 2030 heavily skewing the success rate. Without Tesla, the other four automakers would hit 79% of their 2030 target sales.
Even though Tesla is currently ahead, with just over half a million electric vehicle models sold in 2020, competition from OEMs, and particularly Volkswagen, is heating up.
According to Wood Mackenzie’s analysis, Volkswagen will surpass Tesla by the mid-2020s to be the leading electric vehicle automaker, selling close to 3 million electric vehicles annually by 2030. Tesla will lag behind by nearly 1.5 million vehicles. Nissan-Renault and Hyundai will also surpass Tesla in annual sales by the end of this decade. General Motor’s absence from Europe will be significant over the next decade and will see the company place fifth on the leader board for global sales.
A lack of charging infrastructure and high prices have been widely cited as barriers to widespread electric-vehicle adoption. However, we see progress on both fronts.The projected price of battery packs used in EVs continues to decline. We expect the $100/kWh threshold to be breached by 2024, one year earlier than our previous projections.
Cumulative residential and public charging points are projected to grow to 58 million and 6 million outlets, respectively, by 2030. The sector is expected to have a cumulative investment value of $57 billion and $111 billion, respectively, between 2020 and 2030.
Consumers, too, have a close eye on the economics. And while most are in no small part driven by climate concerns, the financial benefits of switching to zero emission, plug-in hybrids, and battery EVs is also a factor. Price parity with ICE vehicles at point of sale has been achieved in the luxury sedan segment and will extend beyond that niche ahead of original projections – a change that will really see EV adoption accelerate.
The rapidly evolving transportation landscape is beckoning new strategies. As traditional automakers enter the EV race, they are expanding their role from being simple car producers by investing in cell and battery manufacturing, mines, and charging infrastructure. Vertical integration will be key to keep costs down and ensure material availability to support growth.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in an Independence Day speech on Sunday that the country is launching a new National Hydrogen Mission.
Modi said green hydrogen will play a crucial role in helping the nation to mitigate climate change. He said India should become a global hub for green hydrogen production and exports.
“This will not only help India to make new progress in the field of energy self-reliance but will also become a new inspiration for clean energy transition all over the world. New opportunities from green growth to the green job are opening up today for our start-ups and youth,” said Modi. 
The production and use of green hydrogen, produced from renewable electricity, will play a significant role in India’s energy transition as it strives to reduce carbon emissions. Hydrogen is already being explored in transport as fuel for longer-range vehicles and heavy duty trucks, and in the power sector for longer-term energy storage. 
Manoj K Upadhyay, founder and chairman of ACME Group, described the hydrogen mission announcement as “an essential and visionary step at the backdrop of a recent report on climatic conditions because of human-influenced pollution and emissions … Mass deployment of renewable energy in India helped us to produce electricity cheaper than any other sources of energy. Similarly, the deployment of green hydrogen at the lowest cost will help us in a cost leadership position not only to meet our green hydrogen and ammonia demand internally, but also to become a major exporter of green hydrogen.”
According to a recent report by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), hydrogen demand in India was close to 6 million ton per year in 2020, with most of the demand coming from ammonia production and refineries. Most hydrogen in the nation is produced using natural gas through steam methane (CH4) reforming and is used in the refinery and fertilizer industries. The hydrogen is “gray,” as the carbon byproduct leads to CO2 generation.
“Green hydrogen” is zero-carbon hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water (splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen) using renewable electricity. However, the costs of hydrogen from electrolysis (using grid or renewable) today are relatively very high compared to hydrogen from natural gas reformation. The cost can be expected to fall significantly in the coming years as the cost of electricity and electrolyzers falls.
Key projects 
A number of projects have been announced in India, both from the public and private sectors. JSW Energy partnering with Australia-based Fortescue Future Industries on green hydrogen for steelmaking and hydrogen mobility. Indian Oil has announced plans to build the country's first green hydrogen plant at its Mathura refinery. And BGR Energy has launched a new partnership with Ireland’s Fusion Fuel Green on a demonstrator plant for cost-competitive green hydrogen. In addition, a number of companies have set up the India Hydrogen Alliance, led by Reliance Industries. 
ACME Group recently commissioned the world’s first integrated commercial-scale pilot plant for green hydrogen production in Rajasthan. Green hydrogen at the plant will be produced using a 5 MWp solar array, which is an integral part of the project. The green ammonia plant, once commissioned, will produce 5 tons per day of green ammonia, with an annual output of 1,750 tons to 1,800 tons of green fuel. 
“This R&D pilot has given us knowledge, experience, and learnings which we shall utilize in our large-scale green hydrogen and ammonia plants under development,” said ACME Group's Upadhyay.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/17/us-residential-pv-pricing-fell-6-3-over-past-12-months/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 17, 2021",US residential PV pricing fell 6.3% over past 12 months,"From pv magazine USA
EnergySage has released its thirteenth Solar Marketplace Intel Report, in which the company shows that customers were quoted 27% lower prices in the first half of 2021 versus 2014, and that residential solar pricing has fallen 6.3% since July 2020.
This acceleration – starting in July 2020, and ending before July of this year – is compared to the slower price declines EnergySage saw starting in the first half of 2017, and ending in the first half of 2020.
The data shows a broad distribution of pricing, however, and a single national price average doesn’t do it justice. While the median price quoted was $2.67 per watt, greater than 25% of all quotes were $2.25/watt. The long tail of pricing going upward beyond $4.00/watt balanced out the heavy volumes of quotes below the national average.
That fact that so much capacity is being quoted below $2.25/watt is probably worthy of research, so we can better understand the pricing possibilities of the U.S. residential solar market.
Oddly, the nation’s most expensive state, Colorado, at $3.15/watt, is a neighbor of the cheapest state, Arizona, at $2.25/watt.
Notably, while the price has fallen by 6.3% since last year, the average payback time for a similarly sized 10.2 kWdc project has actually increased – from 8.5 to 8.8 years.
A few hypotheses on what’s behind the increased average payback time:
Energy storage pricing is mixed, and on average it went up across the nation. However, in key markets like Florida, California, and Texas, pricing is down. Furthermore, we’re seeing Enphase take an increasingly larger share of the home storage market, passing by Tesla to become the No. 1 supplier.
Interestingly, Enphase is tied with Sonnen as the most expensive home battery product tracked, at roughly 50% more than Tesla’s Powerwall. Enphase’s product success probably has something to do with the increase in energy storage pricing overall.
This nuance in pricing is also potentially indicative of why people are buying batteries – as a backup power source. The second most important reason is to save cash on their electricity bills.
We shouldn’t be surprised that a large number of people have been buying storage for resilience purposes. Generac, a new entrant to the solar+storage industry, has sold plenty of home generators, which saved consumers nothing on their electricity bills. A generator’s payback is measured in units of comfort: air-conditioning, lights, and frozen foods.
While EnergySage has found that customers have always had an interest in energy storage, there is a strong variance in this interest based on geographic location. Many of the states seeking storage are in the central region of the nation, and in places without policies as supportive of solar. Regions that have suffered recent power grid failures have shown a strong energy storage preference as well.
EnergySage says that its data shows clear shifts toward greater demand for energy storage, which remained persistent throughout the past five months, following the Texas power grid failure in February of this year.
