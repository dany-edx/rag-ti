They have found that this combination is already competitive with blue or gray hydrogen generated via fossil fuels.
Their work focused on alkaline electrolyzers, which they described as a mature technology available at megawatt scale, and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, which they defined as a relatively new technology available for small-scale applications.
“Although alkaline electrolysis is a preferred technology, PEM electrolysis is slowly catching the attention of researchers,” they said.
As a case study site, the scientists selected Cologne, where several companies are producing and consuming hydrogen and where hydrogen demand at refueling stations is currently increasing. They assumed the utilization of a solar-powered electrolyzer with a rated production capacity of 21.36 kg/day. The alkaline device was designed to have an installed power of 49 kW and the PEM electrolyzer a capacity of 62 kW. Output pressure for the latter was indicated at 29.9 bar and for the former t 9.9 bar.
Six different scenarios were considered: an alkaline electrolyzer powered by an off-grid PV system with a capacity of 2.6 MW and a battery backup with a capacity of 7,250 kW; a PEM electrolyzer powered by a 3.3 MW off-grid PV system with a battery with a capacity of 9,125 kWh; an alkaline electrolyzer powered by an 850 kW grid-connected solar array; a PEM electrolyzer powered by a 1 MW grid-connected PV installation; an alkaline electrolyzer powered by a 680 kW off-grid PV system with a battery backup of 1,500 kWh and with limited operational time; and a PEM electrolyzer powered by a 950 kW off-grid PV system with a battery backup of 2,000 kWH and limited operational time.
For the last two scenarios, the electrolyzer's operating hours were selected to match with the actual time of solar generation. The levelized cost of hydrogen was evaluated considering the initial investment for building the systems, annual operation costs, annual hydrogen production, discount rate, and system lifetime, which was 20 years for all scenarios.
The higher LCOH was found to be that of electrolyzers powered by off-grid solar, which the scientists explained with the higher costs coming from deploying a battery backup.
“In the off-grid limited operations scenario, the system size is reduced, but the LCOH is still high,” they said, noting that the best performance was achieved by grid-connected solar powering the alkaline electrolyzer, which reached an LCOH of 6.23 €/kg.
For the purpose of comparison, the PEM electrolyzer powered by off-grid solar achieved 57.61 €/kg.
“The results clearly show the fact that the idea to run the electrolyzers 24 hours a day and round the year in off-grid mode is not economically feasible as the hydrogen produced is very expensive,” they said.
Their work also provides a model for system sizing and allows for the calculation of the LCOH anywhere in the world by changing the relevant input parameters. They presented it in the paper “Hydrogen as energy carrier: Techno-economic assessment of decentralized hydrogen production in Germany,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy.

The announcement was given yesterday by the Italian embassy in Algeria, which said on Twitter the agreement represents for the two countries a first step in jointly developing renewable energies. No more details on the deal were disclosed.
On the same day, Italian oil and energy company Eni and Algeria’s state-owned oil and gas provider Sonatrach signed a new oil contract related to the onshore Berkine basin area operated by Eni itself and a memorandum of understanding to cooperate on unspecified initiatives in the energy transition.
“The agreement provides for the assessment of joint opportunities in the fields of renewables, hydrogen, the capture, use and storage of CO2, bio-refining, and many other initiatives in line with the companies’ respective decarbonization objectives,” the two companies said in a joint statement.
Algeria‘s energy ministry is expected to launch soon a tender for the deployment of 1 GW of solar capacity. The Algerian Renewable Energy Company (SHAEMS), which is jointly owned by Sonatrach and power utility Sonelgaz, will be allowed to take a share of up to 25% in the special purpose vehicles that will own the winning projects.
Local content requirements will be included in the procurement exercise, but they will not be mandatory for the first tender of the series, as the capacity of the local industry will only just exceed 1 GW by the end of 2022. Solar developers that use locally manufactured PV components may receive additional bonuses on top of the granted fixed tariff.

The commission today proposed new buildings achieve zero-emission status by having low energy consumption, being powered by renewables where possible, generating no on-site fossil fuel emissions, and spelling out their anticipated whole life-cycle emissions in a new, clearer energy performance certificate.
Buildings are key to our daily lives and significantly impact our health and wellbeing. The majority also have substantial carbon footprints, employing heavy use of fossil fuels across their lifetimes, from their construction, use, and demolition phases. In Q4 2021, pv magazine’s UP Initiative focuses on the role solar and energy storage can play in greening the world’s urban spaces. Read our urban solar coverage here
The proposal, which will now pass to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers consisting of EU member state representatives for consideration, also suggested new public sector buildings meet the same requirements from 2027. The draft policy was presented as part of a recast, second version of the EU's Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD).
Miguel Herrero, senior policy advisor at SolarPower Europe, this afternoon told pv magazine: “SolarPower Europe has long called for the revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive to accelerate the decarbonization of existing buildings with on-site solar and storage. We’re thrilled to see this recast EPBD extend its scope to include the reduction of emissions from buildings, beyond simply improving their energy performance.”
He added: “Today’s proposal for EPDB II is set to mainstream the installation of on-site solar and storage in building renovations.”
Asked whether the commission's suggestions were likely to survive possible pushback from member states, Herrero said: “As with all commission proposals, we will have to see how negotiations evolve in the European Parliament and council, but we know that in 2020 the parliament already indicated its strong support for the renovation wave and maximizing the energy efficiency of all existing buildings.
“And if you look at what is already happening in France, Germany, and Portugal, with announcements of new legislation for solar on buildings, we can see a growing wave of realization that solar technology can and must empower Europe to rapidly decarbonize the continent's buildings.”

A press release published on the Bord Gáis website today, but date stamped “November,” said Neoen is installing arrays with a total generation capacity of 58 MWp at Hortland, in County Kildare; Hilltown, in County Meath; and Millvale, County Wicklow, and the facilities will start generating next year.
Bord Gáis will be sole offtaker for the clean power until 2037.
Although the power company – which is owned by the Centrica energy business based in Windsor – did not state how much it would pay for the electricity procured, the three sites were allocated in the first auction round held under Ireland's Renewable Electricity Support Scheme. That procurement exercise allocated 796 MW of solar capacity for an average strike price of €0.0729/kWh.
The strike price figure, set by the lowest developer bids at auction, represents the actual income for project developers who will sell energy on the wholesale market. When the wholesale price of electricity is below the solar strike price, public money tops up the payments, when the reverse is true, the developer refunds the difference to the payments authority.
Bord Gáis said the PV projects “would be amongst the earliest utility scale solar plants in Ireland,” and added, they would supply enough electricity to power 12,700 homes.
The Irish company said it has a 230 MW wind power generation portfolio and this year partnered with Danish solar investor Obton and Dublin-based PV developer Shannon Energy to “manage” the power to be generated across 11 solar projects with a total 118 MW of generation capacity, all of which was also allocated in the first round of the national renewables program.

German engineering association the VDMA (Verbandes Deutsches Maschinenbau Anlage) recorded a higher order intake and a slight increase in sales in the third quarter of 2021. Compared to the previous quarter, new orders rose by around 40% and sales by approximately 9% and, compared to the third quarter of 2020, revenue climbed by 20%.
The ratio of orders to sales was two-to-one for the second quarter in a row, the association stated. “The growing orders in the field of photovoltaic production equipment and plant construction point in the right direction. In comparison to the previous year in particular, there is a clear growth and a new dynamic,” explained Jutta Trube, head of VDMA photovoltaic production equipment.
According to the new figures, PV equipment suppliers would be in line with the trend registered for general mechanical engineering in Germany, which recorded a double-digit increase in orders in October.
New orders for the German PV suppliers come mainly from China. For the first time this year, China's share was 80%. By contrast, orders from Germany fell below 10% in the third quarter and orders from North America were also lower than in the previous quarters. Nevertheless, German companies also see new market opportunities outside of Asia. The forecasts for the current quarter, however, remain rather cautious, which is due to the existing delivery bottlenecks and the ongoing uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which could drag on well into next year.
“Despite the positive developments in incoming orders, the equipment and system manufacturers are confronted with the uncertainties of the global pandemic situation and the tense situation on the procurement market. A relaxation is expected in the second and third quarter[s] of 2022,” explained Peter Fath, managing director of RCT Solutions GmbH and chairman of the board of directors of VDMA photovoltaic production equipment. The challenge for the German suppliers is to “deal with the bottlenecks and uncertainties in a precise manner.” Nevertheless, Fath rates the general development of projects for photovoltaic production worldwide as good.

Zimplats, which is owned by South African holding company Impala Platinum, outlined its ten-year capital spending plans in an update to the Australian Stock Exchange last week which included details of a US$201 million investment in what was described as “a 185 MW solar plant” being developed, in part, “to maintain Zimplats[‘] licence to operate.”
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for 2022 look even more promising.
The Ecofin article published in August stated the miner would devote US$200 million to two solar facilities: a 105 MW array in Ngezi, southwest of Zimbabwean capital Harare, to power mining operations; and an 80 MW facility for a Zimplats foundry in Selous.
Ecofin reported the miner currently draws power from the Cahora Bassa hydropower plant in Mozambique because of the unreliability of local supply. The solar investment was signed off by Harare as part of a US$1.4 billion commitment by Zimplats to expand its Zimbabwean operations, according to Ecofin.
The stock exchange update issued by the miner stated Zimplats' board has already approved plans for US$1.2 billion of the US$1.8 billion allocated for a ten-year spending plan which will begin this year, and also includes US$516 million to maintain current output through upgrades and mine replacement; US$969 million to expand operations, including with a new mine; and US$100 million to refurbish a mothballed base metal refinery.
Trade body the Africa Solar Industry Association in July said Zimplats is planning to install 200 MW of solar capacity at its Mimosa platinum mine in Bannockburn, Zimbabwe, but no mention was made of that facility in the company's ten-year investment plan.

The partners have set up a 50/50 joint venture, called Aurora, to develop the facility which, if it takes shape, would begin commercial operation in 2026.
Northvolt is keen to establish a more sustainable alternative to the Chinese battery supply chains which currently dominate and said yesterday the planned fab would require spodumene concentrate as a feedstock.
As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about material sourcing for batteries, lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
With the Gem Select website stating the most notable global finds of spodumene are in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Myanmar, Madagascar, Brazil, and the U.S. states of California and North and South Dakota, Northvolt and Galp said they are confident of sourcing sufficient supplies in Iberia “which can be recovered with a low greenhouse gas emission footprint.”
Emphasizing every step of the planned European lithium hydroxide supply chain would be sustainable, the partners said the conversion of spodumene into its concentrated form would also be carried out in the most environmentally-friendly manner and committed to exploring the use of renewable electricity at the Portuguese conversion facility.
However, a press release issued by the partner companies yesterday suggested operations would initially be at least partly powered by gas-fired electricity with the statement saying any clean power used would be “minimizing, and eventually avoiding reliance on natural gas.”
The fab would produce “up to 35,000 tons of battery grade lithium hydroxide per year,” enough to provide 50 GWh of energy storage capacity and 700,000 EV devices, according to the JV partners. Under the terms of the Aurora partnership, Northvolt would agree to take half of the output from a facility which would begin pilot production in 2025.
With the factory estimated to cost around €700 million, and to create 1,500 jobs, the partners said Aurora was considering potential sites and conducting technical and economic feasibility studies but a final investment decision has yet to be taken.
Paolo Cerruti, co-founder and chief operating officer of Northvolt, quoted in the press release, said: “The development of a European battery manufacturing industry provides tremendous economic and societal opportunity … Extending the new European value chain upstream to include raw materials is of critical importance. This joint venture represents a major investment into this area, and will position Europe with not only a path to domestic supply of key materials required in the manufacturing of batteries, but the opportunity to set a new standard for sustainability in raw materials sourcing.”
Northvolt aims to have 150 GWh of European battery manufacturing in operation this decade.

“This decision was made due to an acute shortage of products,” said Swiss Solar. “Even while doubling the production volume (as compared to 2020) and crossing the 1 GW of total annual capacity, it was not possible to meet the needs of regular customers.”
Growing demand and favorable forecasts for the solar markets in Europe, and North and South America were the main factors influencing the choice of location, it said, adding, “Convenient transportation and logistics infrastructure of the region, providing both sea and land delivery, made the choice unambiguous.”
Swiss Solar said the first project phase will involve the preparation of the production areas, including the purchase, installation, and adjustment of equipment for three PV module lines with a nominal capacity of 450 Wp, 500 Wp, and 545 Wp, respectively. “Swiss Solar is already negotiating with the world's leading manufacturers, whose names will be disclosed after the supply contract is signed,” it said.
By 2027, the company says it aims to have 10 production lines with a capacity of up to 500 MW each, which would allow it to reach a level of at least 5 GW of total annual capacity. It also intends to manufacture 590Wp PV modules by that time.
“The main promotion efforts in Europe and North America will focus on the residential segment, and in South America, on the commercial, and utility segments,” it said.
The finished PV modules will reportedly come with a 25-year guarantee and the entire product range is expected to be tested by recognized companies including TÜV SÜD Product Service GmbH, UL (US), TUV Rheinland of North America, Inc., TSE Certification Center (Turkey), ANCE – Asociación de Normalización y Certificación, A.C. (Mexico), and InMetro (Brazil); and certified under the following certifications:
“The successful progress of the project already allows Swiss Solar to conclude that the new plant and its innovative products will not only enable the company to meet the needs of its regular customers but will also open new markets,” concluded the company.

The scientists adopted an industrial approach for LPCVD and used a homogeneous boron-diffused front emitter and screen-printed metallization. “The poly-Si film was deposited in … single-wafer LPCVD equipment,” the research corresponding author, Meriç Fırat, told pv magazine. “There are already tools available from tool manufacturers which are capable of LPCVD processes with in situ doping, with decent poly-Si film uniformity.”
The poly-Si films were integrated into the cell in two sets of experiments.
Through a first experiment, intended at assessing the impact of the films on cell performance, the researchers built a 241.3cm2 bifacial device with a zero-busbar design on both sides and a 70nm thick plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) hydrogenated silicon nitride (SiNx:H) film applied to the rear side for improving the passivation quality. “For metallization, silver and silver/aluminum pastes were screen-printed at the rear and front sides, respectively, followed by firing of the pastes through the SiNx:H films for realizing contacts with the poly-Si and the emitter,” they explained. “Firing was performed with a belt speed of 150in/min and a set peak temperature of 855 degrees Celsius.”
“The wraparound of the LPCVD poly-Si film at the front side was removed by masking the front side with a 200nm thick silicon monoxide (SiOx) mask grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition … before LPCVD and using dry-etching,” Fırat stated. “We are confident that this part of the process can be simplified and transferred to industrial equipment capable of removing the unwanted poly-Si film at the front side by high-throughput single-side etching.”
Through a second experiment, aimed at investigating the impact of the rear surface morphology on the cell, the academics made the screening on a series of cells with a polished rear surface, a 90nm thick SiOx layer deposited by PECVD in a single-wafer system on top of the front SiNx:H film and a metal grid to create a double anti-reflection coating (DARC) intended at reducing front reflectance.
The performance of all solar cells was analyzed under standard illumination conditions and an inspection by optical microscopy was also conducted to assess the quality of the screen-printed contacts. The best performance was achieved by a cell with a polished rear surface using the DARC and consisting of a stack of 70nm SiNx and 90nm SiOx films. This device reached a power conversion efficiency of 23.01%, a high open-circuit voltage of 691.7 mV, a short-circuit current of 40.95 and a fill factor of 81.25%.
“The solar cells reported in our paper can be quite easily transferred to commercial production,” Fırat went on to say. “Some initial effort would be required to transfer the in situ doping-based LPCVD process to batch-type industrial equipment but we consider this to be achievable. The efficiency gain obtained with the DARC is probably not transferable to the module level, so I am still not sure if the DARC would be used in industrial production.”
The device was presented in the paper “Large-area bifacial n-TOPCon solar cells with in situ phosphorus-doped LPCVD poly-Si passivating contacts,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. The research group comprised scientists from Belgian research entities KU Leuven, VITO, imec and UHasselt, as well as from Kuwait University.

Adani Green Energy (AGEL), the renewable energy unit of Adani Group, has signed agreements with Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) to supply 4.7 GW of solar power.
The capacity is part of a manufacturing-linked 8 GW solar tender awarded to AGEL by SECI in June 2020. The exercise set a record as the world’s largest solar development tender ever awarded.
AGEL has since signed close to 6 GW of PPAs with SECI. It expects to sign deals for the remaining 2 GW of capacity in the next two to three months. 
Through its subsidiaries, AGEL has signed PPAs for periods of 25 years. It has also signed contracts with SECI to set up solar PV manufacturing plants for a total capacity of 2 GW. This will help AGEL move swiftly toward its target of 25 GW of operational capacity by 2025.
“We are pleased to have signed the world’s largest PPA with SECI,” said Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Group. “This is yet another step in our journey to enable India’s dual objective to accelerate India’s renewable energy footprint, as well as promote domestic manufacturing under the Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) program.”

US residential solar has had another record run this year. Forecasts show that 2021 will represent a 21% year-over-year increase in residential solar as the market reaches 3.9 GW of installed capacity, said the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Residential SolarReviews released its annual review of the sector and noted a 130% increase in customer quote requests. The US solar market has now surpassed 3 million solar installations, most of which are distributed residential PV, said SEIA. As commodity prices rose, costs took a small uptick in all solar sectors in the first half of 2021, reports SEIA.
In a report published in partnership with the University of California, Berkeley, SolarReviews found that 72.5% of survey respondents said that the upfront costs of solar remain the most significant barrier to adoption. The primary motivations for installation include bill savings, followed by disaster resiliency and reduced carbon emissions.
With quote requests reaching new highs, SolarReviews has released a home solar calculator, which allows shoppers to estimate the size of the system needed, storage options, and financing options. The tool will soon model cost and emissions savings associated with charging an electric vehicle with residential solar, said SolarReviews. This year, SolarReviews reported a tenfold increase in quote requests related to its guide on how to charge a Tesla at home.
Home battery interest and growth are ramping up nearly exponentially. The joint study showed that in the span of five years (2016-20), 71% of battery installations occurred in 2020 alone. Installation totals for this year are expected to be even higher, said the report.
Interest in battery storage alongside solar is increasing, but only 11.5% of solar customer respondents to the survey said they have attached batteries. SolarReviews noted a sharp uptick in solar and energy storage quotation requests during extreme weather events. During the peak wildfire season in California, it reported a 358% increase in quote requests, for example.
