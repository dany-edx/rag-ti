In a recent settlement with the state of California, the Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) faced accusations of misleading the public regarding their use of “renewable natural gas.” Authorities in the state accused the company of violating two California laws: the Unfair Competition Law (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200 et seq.) and the False Advertising Law (§ 17500 et seq.)
Under the terms of the settlement, SoCalGas is required to pay a fine of $175,000, halt its deceptive advertising that labels its gas as ‘renewable’, and release a statement on its website noting that only 5% of its gas originates from renewable sources.
The complaint filed by the state of California revealed that SoCalGas deliberately misled consumers. While ‘renewable’ gas does exist, the company falsely marketed its conventional gas product as such. The evidence is stark: in 2018, despite its claims of selling ‘renewable natural gas’, the company sold absolutely none. By 2022, it had only managed to provide 5% renewable gas to residential, small commercial, and industrial customers.
In 2019, California authorities turned a spotlight on SoCalGas’s advertising tactics. They discovered that the company made sweeping ‘renewable’ marketing claims on informational displays, backdrops, and promotional items like hats, t-shirts, and notepads. These were widely distributed at approximately 14 conferences and community events that SoCalGas either participated in or sponsored. Among these events was the “Ag Expo,” a massive three-day gathering attracting approximately 100,000 attendees, where SoCalGas featured an ‘educational’ and interactive display. The company also sponsored a “Heal the Bay” event, providing a photo booth backdrop for attendees.
Gas is primarily composed of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Historically, the term ‘natural’ was applied to it in the 1800s to differentiate methane obtained directly from the ground from the gas derived from coal processing. Today, a more apt, modern descriptor for this energy source is ‘fossil gas’.
SoCalGas’s misrepresentation of its fuel as ‘renewable’ gas, as described by California’s filing, references biomethane primarily derived from landfills and dairy operations, then converted to biomethane, mostly for use in transportation. Using biomethane instead of fossil gas achieves a “net reduction” in the emission of greenhouse gasses that exacerbate climate change.
However, fighting climate change by capturing and burning biomethane and releasing the resulting CO2 has a modest effect at best. Alternatively, recent emission studies on cows’ diets at the University of California, Davis and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization at James Cook University in Australia showed that replacing 2% of a cow’s diet with macro red algae can cut methane emissions from enteric fermentation by 99% via an enzyme inhibitor in the algae.

As electricity markets fluctuate and energy prices rise, German households are increasingly seeking self-sufficiency with rooftop PV systems and batteries. About 70% of new residential systems in Germany now include home storage. However, not all claims about battery storage use are accurate.
In order to counter false expectations, Verbraucherzentrale NRW has clarified the five main mistakes that could be made when buying a residential storage system.
1: Battery storage cannot be installed at a later stage
This is not true. Verbraucherzentrale NRW said that integrating battery storage later is achievable with a hybrid inverter in a PV system. Retrofitting is also feasible with a conventional inverter, even after many years of PV system operation.
2: The larger the battery, the better
“This is wrong,” the consumer group said. Although battery storage systems are still expensive, they should not be oversized for economic purposes. As a rule of thumb for the appropriate size of storage, they said that every 1,000 kWh of annual electricity demand justifies 1 kWh of storage capacity. In other words, with an annual electricity demand of 5,000 kWh, a storage system should have a capacity of 5 kWh. Consumers should also consider the size of a PV system and remember that rather small systems rarely produce enough surplus power to charge large battery storage.
3: You can always save money by using battery storage
“This is another misconception,” the association said, noting that residential batteries still have high upfront costs. This is only the case if the sale of excess solar power into the grid over the estimated service life is higher than the purchase cost of the battery. Verbraucherzentrale NRW offers calculations and estimates as to whether the savings to be expected are higher than the purchase price.
4: With a battery storage system, electricity can be stored in the summer for the winter
Some battery providers use this narrative to advertise their products. Verbraucherzentrale NRW said that the residential batteries that are currently available on the market can only be used to shift excess solar power for consumption in the evening or at night, with no seasonal storage being possible.
5: With battery storage, users always have electricity and are independent of the power grid
Verbraucherzentrale NRW, which is based in in North Rhine-Westphalia, provides a resounding “no” in response to this. Households remain reliant on the technical connection to the public grid, even with PV systems and storage. In cases of power failure, standard photovoltaic systems and home storage systems cease to supply energy unless equipped with an emergency power or backup system, an addition that Consumer advocates estimate to cost between €500 ($540) and €2,000.
“It is important to be aware of the personal goals of using photovoltaics in conjunction with battery storage and then to obtain comprehensive information,” said Stefan Hoffmann, an energy analyst at Verbraucherzentrale NRW.
In March, Verbraucherzentrale NRW warned about a series of myths that consumers should know when buying residential PV systems.
“It is important to be aware of the personal goals of using photovoltaics and then to find out more. In this way, disappointments can be avoided and solar power can be used really efficiently,” said Sören Demandt, a digital energy transition analyst for Verbraucherzentrale NRW.

They said that this is the first attempt at using the standard sheet metal hood of a regular passenger car as a surface for solar power devices and explained that all previous VIPV technologies have been deployed on cars' roofs or sides.
The team developed the inaugural system prototype on a Volkswagen vehicle. The 115 W solar array features PERC solar cells. This technology was chosen after evaluating other options, such as interdigitated back-contact (IBC) and TOPCon solar cells.
“In principle, any solar cell technology can be used,” it stated
The scientists assembled the PV system via a lamination process that reportedly minimizes air pockets between the cells. They said this prevents the wrinkling of the film module caused by the curved surface of the hood.
They also colored the system with Fraunhofer ISE's proprietary MorphoColor technology, which was originally created for building-integrated PV (BIPV) applications. The technique enables the production of solar modules with homogeneous surfaces and different colors that can be integrated “almost invisibly” on facades or roofs.
“We’ve already achieved a very good aesthetic with this,” said researcher Martin Heinrich. “We’re currently working on improving the surface appearance even further. To this end, we’re actively on the lookout for project partners who are interested in joint development.”
The research group is currently testing different prototypes in the laboratory and believes its lamination process and the MorphoColor technology might be applied on other car surfaces, including the roof. In past research, Fraunhofer ISE also tested high-voltage solar modules developed in partnership with industrial clients for heavy-duty trucks.

India installed 3.6 GW of solar capacity in the first six months of 2023, down 53% from the 7.6 GW installed in the corresponding period last year. Additions reached 1.7 GW in the second quarter alone, down 58% from 4 GW installed in the second quarter of 2022, according to new data from Mercom India Research.
Large-scale solar projects accounted for 77% (more than 1.3 GW) of the capacity added in the second quarter of 2023, with rooftop solar making up the rest. 
India’s cumulative installed solar capacity, including total rooftop solar installations, surpassed 66 GW at the end of June 2023.
The country’s utility-scale project development pipeline stood at more than 67 GW on June 30.
“Delays, extensions, and postponements have led to a substantial number of solar projects being deferred to the next year, making 2023 a year of setbacks for solar in India,” said Raj Prabhu, the CEO of Mercom Capital Group. “Consequently, 2024 looks extremely robust. Rapidly declining solar component and project costs will be a catalyst for additional growth.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/23/floating-pv-plant-operators-may-achieve-additional-revenue-through-non-evaporated-water/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",BERNADETTE GEYER,"AUGUST 23, 2023",Floating PV plant operators may achieve additional revenue through non-evaporated water,"A group of Italian researchers has investigated the cost competitiveness of nine different floating PV (FPV) configurations installed on a water basin in Southern Italy, and compared it with that of ground mounted PV (GPV) systems. Their analysis was based on Capex and Opex, as well as on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE).
The scientists emphasized that moving a monofacial PV array from land to water increases the performance by almost 5%. “An additional 2.5% enhancement could be achieved if monofacial modules are replaced with bifacial modules,” they added. “More improvements are possible, as expected, if trackers are mounted.”
By using a tracker configured with a vertical axis in their simulation, the group found that the FPV system may provide a 20% higher yield compared to an FPV system with a fixed structure. It also ascertained that an FPV system relying on two-axis trackers may have a higher yield compared to a fixed and single vertical axis configuration, by 40% and 16%, respectively.
The scientists modeled the energy and economic performance of different FPV designs on a water basin in Sicily, Southern Italy, based on energy parameters sourced from previous literature. The model also takes into consideration potential revenues resulting from the reduced water evaporations thanks to the shading effect of the FPVs. This water may then be used for hydropower generation or in agriculture.
The academics also found that FPVs have a higher Capex than ground-based installations, noting that the floating solar technology is still at the early stage of development and the limited installed capacity of FPV compared to GPV. “In 2020, FPV had the same capacity that GPV achieved in the early 2000s,” they added.
The researchers conducted a sensitivity analysis of the LCOE to account for potential future reductions in the capital cost of FPVs. They concluded that with a 30% reduction in Capex, the bifacial FPV with fixed structures would be the most competitive system at the given location, resulting in a 19.9% reduction in LCOE compared with a fixed monofacial GPV.
The group emphasized that the use of non-evaporated water at FPV system sites can achieve revenues greater than $3/kW if used for irrigation and higher than $4/kW if sold to generate hydroelectricity. “This demonstrates the added value that active cooling and non-evaporated water can bring to the floating system,” they concluded.
Their findings are available in the report “Economic comparison of floating photovoltaic systems with tracking systems and active cooling in a Mediterranean water basin,” published in Energy for Sustainable Development. The group comprises researchers from the University of Catania, Sapienza University of Rome, and the University of Florence.
The researchers stressed that, while the conditions of the site in Sicily chosen for this comparative study could be considered representative of other locations overlooking the Mediterranean, “the quantitative results will have to be adjusted to the site-specific conditions of any new location where the investigation is repeated.”

“The iShare-Home Mini solution has rapidly been embraced by the German market and is now sold out through prioritized channels,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine, noting that the system will be available for sale in Italy from September.
The system consists of two 425 W all-black solar panels, an 800 W microinverter, and a mounting structure. It also includes a set with a 5-meter AC cable, a 3-meter DC cable, and a 3P connector.
The modules feature n-type cell technology, with a power conversion efficiency of 21.76%. They measure 1,722 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh 21.5 kg. Their open-circuit voltage is 37.83 V and the short-circuit voltage is 13.31 A. The temperature coefficient is -0.34% per degree Celsius.
The microinverters measure 230 mm x 190 mm x 46.5 mm and weigh 3.3 kg, with an efficiency of 96.5% and a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) efficiency rate of 99.9%. It supports a maximum input voltage of 60 V within an MPPT voltage range of 25 V to 55 V.
The alloy mounting structure, weighing 10 kg, offers an adjustable angle of 30 degrees to 50 degrees. The system includes a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year extra linear power output warranty.
“Benefitting from its pre-installation and connection design, the system requires only a few minutes of setup before providing eco-friendly energy,” the manufacturer said. “The plug-and-play aluminum alloy system suits various scenarios such as balconies, gardens and walls.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/23/perovskite-solar-cell-built-on-steel-substrate-achieves-record-efficiency-of-17-1/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 23, 2023",Perovskite solar cell built on steel substrate achieves record efficiency of 17.1%,"A group of scientists led by the University of Sydney has fabricated a perovskite solar cell that utilizes a substrate made of steel instead of glass.
“The advantage of being flexible and conductive means the steel itself can act as both a substrate and an electrode for either large-area-monolithic-panel or smaller-area-singular single-junction or multi-junction cell fabrication,” the research's lead author, Anita Ho-Baillie, told pv magazine. She suggested that the cell could be used for building-integrated PV (BIPV), vehicle-integrated solar (VIPV), or other design-integrated photovoltaics for terrestrial or space applications.
In the study “Efficient perovskite solar cell on steel enabled by diffusion barrier and surface passivation,” published in Cell Reports Physical Science, the researchers explained that steel is flexible and conductive while offering good thermal stability, strength, and toughness. It is, however, an opaque material, which makes it necessary to use a transparent electrode for the solar cell. To this end, the scientists used an indium tin oxide (ITO) interlayer between the steel substrate and the cell, in order to avoid iron diffusion from the substrate into the PV device.
They built the cell with the steel substrate, an 80-nm-thick ITO layer, a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer, the perovskite absorber, a Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting layer, a buffer layer made of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), and the ITO transparent electrode.
A first device constructed with this configuration achieved a power conversion efficiency of 13.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 1,072 mV, a short-circuit current density of 18.3 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 0.67. A similar cell built without the ITO interlayer, by contrast, achieved an efficiency of only 6%, with the other values being 763 mV, 17.2 mA/cm2, and 0.46, respectively.
The academics decided to utilize a passivation strategy using a bromide-containing long alkyl chain organic cation n-OABra to further improve the performance of the cell using the ITO interlayer, which resulted in an enhanced efficiency of 17.1%, which they claim is the highest efficiency ever reported to date for a perovskite solar cell built on a steel substrate.
“This work inspires future work where different materials as an interlayer could be investigated and where cells using materials with better refractive index matching can be demonstrated with the aim of further boosting the performance and stability of perovskite cells on steel,” the researchers stated.
Ho-Baillie added that no techno-economic analysis of the cells has been conducted to date. “We have done so for perovskite on glass, roll-to-roll manufacturing of perovskite cells, and silicon–perovskite tandem cells indicating cost competitiveness assuming the lifetime of perovskite cells can match that of the incumbent silicon cell technology,” she concluded.

They found that these storage systems should have an LCOS lower than €66.2 ($72.07)/MWh, provided that gas prices stay at low levels.
Carnot batteries are systems that store electricity in the form of heat through storage media such as water or molten salt and transform the heat back to electricity when needed. This category includes liquid air energy storage (LAES) systems and Brayton or Rankine based pumped thermal energy storages (PTES) systems, as well as Lamm-Honigmann storage, which is a sorption-based technique that can be charged and discharged with both heat and electrical power, and systems based on integrated resistive heating with power cycles.
All these storage technologies, according to the research team, allow a broad range of applications such as arbitrage business, ancillary services, or peak shaving within power networks. “Additionally, the readily available hot and cold storages are unique features of Carnot batteries enabling multi-energy flexibility through the external use and integration of hot and cold recycle streams,” they explained.
The group sought to assess the economic feasibility of Carnot batteries in a 100% renewable energy scenario applied to Denmark by 2045. The scenario assumes that 14 GW of offshore wind power, 5 GW of onshore wind power, and 10 GW of PV are installed in the country, with around 70% of the primary energy demand comprising electricity, heating, cooling, transport, and process heating demands being covered by clean energies.
Furthermore, the energy system is assumed to rely on 4.8 GW of electrolysis capacity, 6 GW of transmission capacity, a maximum of 2 GW of charge capacity for Carnot batteries, and 4.8 GW of combined heat and power (CHP) plants. “As Carnot batteries are expected to be used for storage within a maximum of a few weeks, the maximum storage capacity tested is 7 days of full charging,” the scientists said.
They used the EnergyPLAN simulation software to determine the renewable energy generation capacities, economic costs, and supply strategies needed to balance the projected future electricity demand in Denmark. In the simulation, Carnot batteries were modeled as stand-alone batteries, without potential heat output for district heating or industrial purposes.
Through their simulation, the researchers found that Carnot batteries may become economically feasible if their LCOS is lower than €66.2 ($72.07)/MWh, which they said includes the total expenditure over their full lifetime. This value, however, was calculated assuming a gas price of €9.3/GJ. “If the gas price would reach electro-methane levels the LCOS range would instead be around €119–130/MWh,” they also explained. “If the potential cost reduction is instead identified based on reducing capacities for electrolysis and hydrogen storage the LCOS drops to €38–43/MWh, depending on the cost of these components.”
The group also noted that currently, only one Carnot battery system concept has been identified with an LCOS lower than the €62/MWh. “Existing concepts for stand-alone Carnot batteries are not able to achieve these costs today, therefore solutions for cost reductions should be investigated,” they concluded.
The researchers presented their findings in the study “Economic potentials of carnot batteries in 100% renewable energy systems,” which was recently published in Energy. The team comprises academics from the Aalborg University and Technical University of Denmark.

For the fifth month in a row, module prices fell further by around 6% on average. The ongoing decline in prices has led to an overall average reduction of 25% across all module technologies since the start of the year.
Even as raw material costs in China stabilize, high inventories continue to drive down module prices. Manufacturers and wholesalers are grappling with recurring losses in their day-to-day operations. To clear these accumulated stocks, discounts must be offered, and those unwilling to sell below production or purchase prices face the prospect of losing out.
In response, Asian manufacturers are managing the situation by curbing the filling of European warehouses and reducing replenishment. However, the pressure to sell persists as existing inventories depreciate on a weekly basis. Some module customers are attempting to exit current supply contracts or cancel standing orders. However, such actions are not straightforward and come with potential high penalties. Adjusting the purchase price slightly is advised during these negotiations.
The duration of this challenging market scenario remains uncertain. The situation could improve as PV demand potentially picks up in Europe during late summer, coupled with the year-end rally in the Chinese market. Nonetheless, the exact extent of solar panel stockpiles, particularly of PERC technology, in European warehouses and the timeline for clearing this excess remain uncertain. Further price reductions are anticipated in the upcoming weeks and months.

Aims Power says it has released two new hybrid inverters, which combine solar inverters and battery inverters for rooftop solar-plus-storage systems.
The inverters include a 4.6 kW power output, 6.9 kW solar input model, as well as a larger 9.6 kW power output, 15 kW solar input model. This makes them the right size for most rooftop residential solar arrays. Both products support a maximum PV voltage of up to 660 V.
Aims Power’s inverters have a CEC rated efficiency of 97%. It has a generator input for backup power rated at 240 Vac. The customizable DC input allows for pairing with both lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries.
Users can control the inverter with a mobile app to remotely monitor production, track energy usage, battery levels, and system performance. It can be configured to operate electrical loads on just solar, just the battery, or both, and can be optimized around net metering, load share, battery back up, grid tie or off-grid operations. 
“Where the Aims Power Hybrid Inverter makes an immediate impact is in its ability to be programmed to do exactly what you want it to do.,” said Aims Power. “Think of an orchestra without a conductor. It may have all the talent and potential in the world, but without a way to organize and direct it, you may as well listen to radio static. Aims Power Hybrid Inverter is essentially the conductor for every source of power that you have in your house.”
The inverter has achieved UL 1741-SA, CSA 22.2 No.107-01, UL1998, and UL1699B certifications for safety and are IP65 NEMA4X rated for outdoor installation. Both inverters are warrantied for 10 years.
Aims Power says on its website that the 4.6 kW output inverter retails for $3,900, while the 9.6 kW inverter retails for $4,900. The company, based in Reno, Nevada, is a supplier of recreational vehicle (RV) power electronics and off-grid electrical equipment. Its product line comprises 95 different options, from DC to AC inverters, solar panels, deep-cycle batteries, and solar charge controllers.
