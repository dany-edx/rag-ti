PPC Renewables estimates the cost of the 550 MW plant to be around €216 million ($221.4 million), excluding the cost of PV modules. However, bids for the tender can exceed that sum, said PPC. 
The winning engineering, procurement and construction contractor will need to complete the licensing of the plant, with only some license updates still deemed necessary at this point. Aside from the PV project, the winning contractor will also need to build two substations and upgrade the local electricity transmission line. However, the contractor will not have to buy and transport the solar panels, as PPC will arrange this separately.  
Eligible bidders should be legal entities in the European Union or the European Economic Area and meet specific business and financial criteria, with established PV portfolios. Their offers should be submitted digitally by Sept. 30 at the latest. The project’s construction phase should not exceed 22 months, said PPC Renewables, although the EPC contract will have a duration of 48 months in total. 
The new 550 MW plant is part of PPC’s master plan to install 3 GW of PV capacity on the Peloponnese Peninsula in southern Greece and in the former mining region of Kozani in the north.
Subsidy-free PV 
PPC Renewables’ chief executive, Konstantinos Mavros, told pv magazine that the new 550 MW plant won’t participate in Greece’s renewable power tenders scheme. Instead, the new project in Kozani will operate subsidy-free, based on a power purchase agreement (PPA) signed between PPC Renewables and its parent, Greece’s dominant electricity supplier.
Mavros said the 550 MW plant in Kozani is the company’s second subsidy-free, PPA-based solar project. It already has a 50 MW solar array under construction in Megalopolis, a mining town on the Peloponnese Peninsula. The EPC contract for that project was won by Greece's Terna Energy in the summer of 2021.
In October, PPC Renewables signed a deal with Germany’s RWE to develop 2 GW of coal-mine solar capacity. Mavros has since visiting RWE’s headquarters in Germany in July. However, he noted that the 550 MW plant in Kozani and the 50 MW park in Megalopolis are not part of the company's partnership with RWE.

They focused on the common blending method, based on the injection of hydrogen through a side branch into a main gas header pipe (T-junction). “The low molecular mass of hydrogen reduces the penetration of a side-branch flow and increases the buoyancy forces leading to stratification with high hydrogen concentrations on the upper pipe surface, downstream of the branch,” the team said. “Top-side injection leads to the hydrogen concentration remaining >40% for up to eight pipe diameters from the injection point for volumetric dilutions less than 30%. Under-side injection promotes mixing within the flow interior and reduces wall concentration at the lower surface, compared to top-side injection.”

The Chinese lithium-ion battery maker has revealed plans to invest €7.34 billion in the construction of a 100 GWh battery plant in Debrecan, Hungary – the biggest greenfield investment in the country's history.
Subject to shareholder approval, construction of the first production facilities will start later this year. The planned facility, which covers an area of 221 hectares in the Southern Industrial Park of Debrecen, will help to accelerate e-mobility and the energy transition in Europe, said CATL. It will supply cells and modules to European automakers, including existing customers such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Stellantis, and Volkswagen.
As part of its commitment to reducing its carbon footprint in battery production, CATL will use electricity from renewable energy. It said it is considering the development of solar projects with local partners in the country. CATL also aims to build a sustainable and circular battery value chain by examining the possibility of joining forces with local partners to set up facilities for battery materials in Europe.
The new battery plant in Hungary will be CATL’s second European battery gigafactory. It is currently working on building a much smaller plant in Germany – its first factory outside of China. With a total investment of €1.8 billion, CATL plans to achieve a production capacity of 14 GWh. It broke ground on the facility in Arnstadt, Germany, in 2019. It is scheduled to start cell production by the end of this year.
“There is no doubt that our plant in Debrecen will enable us to further sharpen our competitive edge, better respond to our European customers, and accelerate the transition to e-mobility in Europe,” said Robin Zeng, founder and chairman of CATL.
As part of its strategic efforts to reduce its dependence on Asian battery cell imports, Europe is set to host around 35 gigafactories by 2035, according to some of the latest predictions. According to data from the EU's important projects of common European interest (IPCEI) fund, a massive build-up and expansion of battery production capacity is now being planned.
The annual production volume of lithium-ion cells in the EU's member states – plus Norway and EU accession state Serbia – reached 35 GWh in 2020, accounting for around 15% of the global total. That figure is expected to rise to 600 GWh to 870 GWh, or 43% of the estimated world market, by the end of this decade.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/12/huge-opportunity-for-module-level-power-electronics/,"INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 12, 2022",Huge opportunity for module-level power electronics,"Module-level power electronics (MLPE), where an inverter or optimizer is attached to each PV module, allowing for its current and voltage to be controlled individually, has been around for a long time but seen relatively few system owners prepared to make the additional investment or understand the added complexity.
However, a report published this week by IHS Markit, now part of S&P Global, suggests that change may be air for MLPE, thanks a range of market influences. The report, aptly titled Module Level Power Electronics, finds that the market for MLPE grew by 33% between 2019 and 2021, and that last year, in the residential sector at least, around one third of new PV installations came with MLPE.
For residential PV, rapid shutdown capability is increasingly outlined in safety regulations both to prevent the unlikely occurrence of a system catching fire, and to remove the danger of firefighters having to deal with dangerously high voltages. The United States was first to introduce this regulation, and Thailand, the Philippines and others have since followed suit, with other major PV markets including China reportedly considering rapid shutdown requirements as well. And since MLPE is one of the simplest ways to meet these safety requirements, the regulations have been key to its growth.
As PV’s popularity continues to grow, more complicated systems are being built with modules partially shaded at different times of day, facing in different directions, etc. Here MLPE can minimize energy losses, compared to a string inverter system whose output is limited to that of the lowest performing module connected to it.
Also driving the trend toward MLPE is the general trend toward smaller, distributed generation systems that are likely to make better use of it. IHS Markit finds that falling costs, supportive policies and increasingly innovative business models have driven growth in the segment, now expected to account for almost 43% of global PV installations between 2022 and 2025.
“Ten years ago, rooftop installations were largely concentrated in Europe, however as other markets have developed, a more diverse picture has emerged,” reads the report. “China (mainland) has since bolstered rooftop PV installations which has contributed to Asia Pacific surpassing EMEA as the main market for rooftop PV. China (mainland) is expected to comprise 32% of global rooftop installations in 2022, while EMEA is expected to represent 27%, driven by Germany, Netherlands, and Poland. The Americas region is set to comprise 16% in 2022, supported by the United States and Brazil.”
For now, the United State remains the largest market for MLPE thanks to its early move on regulation, but movements show that it is becoming much more common elsewhere, even in regions where no rapid shutdown requirement exists. “In recent years, the United States’ dominance in the MLPE market has been challenged by certain markets in Europe such as Netherlands and Germany, in South America such as Brazil and in Asia such as Australia,” it says. “While consumers are not obliged to adopt these technologies, they have been persuaded by other benefits such as optimized yield, enhanced monitoring capabilities, and in certain cases, easier installation.”
Beyond this, IHS Markit finds the rise of the ‘smarthome’ concept, where system owners want a high level of control over their power generation and consumption, as another driving factor, alongside the easier operations & maintenance that’s afforded by being able to collect system data at the module level, and in the future the introduction of ‘smart modules’ supplied with built in MLPE could push this technology even further.

The 707.96 kWp array will generate 10% of the facility's total power demand, or 3.5 MWh of electricity per day.  
Another 5.5 MWh/day plant will go online on the 80,000-square-foot rooftop area of another Pacific Jeans factory in September. The 1.06 MWp plant will meet 15% of the power demand of the factory.
The projects will help the company to source about 20% of its electricity from renewables. Its investments in clean energy generation are now set to reach $10 million.
“Our target is to get 50% of our electricity demand from renewable sources by 2030,” said Syed M Tanvir, the managing director of Pacific Jeans.
He said that buyers of the company's products have their own environmental sustainability goals and emission targets. The group aims to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 6,458 tons per year, said Tanvir.
The group first set up a 70 kWp rooftop solar plant at a facility owned by NHT Fashions back in 2017. It said the $76,923 project had generated 446 MWh of clean electricity by April of this year.
In recent years, many Bangladeshi factory owners have shown interest in generating power from rooftop solar. Many rooftop PV projects sized between 1 MW and 12 MW have already been installed. Many such facilities are now under construction, according to industry sources.
Bangladesh currently has about 100 MWp of rooftop solar capacity across 1,867 projects, according to government data.

Norwegian solar manufacturer REC Group and its new parent company, Reliance Industries Ltd., plan to exhibit a new PV module at the Renewable Energy India (REI) expo, which is scheduled to take place between Sept. 28 and Sept. 30.
REC will unveil its new Alpha Pure-R solar panel, just one year after launching its REC Alpha Pure model, which won the 2022 Intersolar Award. The company said it has doubled its Alpha HJT production capacity in Singapore for the new model.
The REC Alpha Pure-R panel features G12 heterojunction (HJT) cells in a patented design, delivering a power output of up to 430 Wp in a module that is less than 2 square meters in size. This makes the new product ideal for residential installations, where space is limited.
“The REC Alpha Pure-R hits the sweet spot in terms of its power output, size, weight, and handling,” said REC CEO Jan Enno Bicker. “With its high-power density innovations, the new panel follows the lead-free and RoHS compliant REC Alpha Pure Series.”
The REC Alpha Pure-R will go into production at REC’s new facilities in Singapore. The company is now doubling its Alpha HJT product line capacity from 600 MW to 1.2 GW.
In addition, REC and Reliance Industries are trying to recruit talent for their new solar gigafactory in the Indian state of Gujarat. The complex will produce solar panels, energy storage systems, electrolyzers, and fuel cells, spread out over 5,000 acres of space.
