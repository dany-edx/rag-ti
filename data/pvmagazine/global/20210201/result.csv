Participants considered policy and regulatory challenges, as well as solar financing constraints, at an event organised by the Gurugram-based International Solar Alliance (ISA) alongside the Centre for Energy Finance section of Delhi-based research non-profit the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).
Panelists at Wednesday's event proposed financial interventions to accelerate renewables investment, emphasizing the measures necessary to attract and scale-up capital flows in developing markets.
Upendra Tripathy, director-general of the ISA – whose membership consists of 121 tropical nations – pointed to three obstacles to financing clean power in emerging markets which the organization is addressing: land and labor, capital and technology.
The membership body – which delivered the webinar as part of its Solar Technology and Application Resources Centers project – is mapping pockets of land suitable for large scale solar and attempting to head off land access rights issues at an early stage. Tripathy said the ISA is also establishing a community-engagement framework to avoid land-related conflicts and is attempting to train workers in solar project construction and maintenance.
The director-general also highlighted the reluctance of offshore investors to commit to clean power in emerging markets because of challenges such as local currency and exchange rate risks.
The organization also advocates the adoption of affordable public-domain technologies to drive solar deployment, according to Tripathy.
In the absence of fully-subsidized small scale solar applications, Tripathy pointed to the potential effectiveness of aggregating groups of clean power consumers – ideally living in close proximity – and presenting them as single investment opportunities to solar installers and investors, as a means of driving down the price of installations.
Arjun Dutt, senior analyst at the CEEW Center for Energy Finance, said solar projects in India, Indonesia and Sri Lanka suffer from varying degrees of the same hurdles to investment, with India showing the way for its Asian peers in how to deal with obstacles such as a lack of predictable development pipelines; inaccurate assessments of demand; and the inadequate scale of domestic capital available to invest, plus its associated finance costs.
Webinar participants also cited electricity transmission constraints as a hurdle to clean power roll-out in developing markets.
Potential solutions included the introduction of renewable portfolio standards, which require power generators to source a percentage of their electricity from clean generation; the establishment of centralized renewables parks, to overcome land acquisition and power transmission risks; and improving contracts to make them more bankable by adding termination provisions, sovereign guarantees, and allocation of change-in-law risks to power purchase agreements.
Lucial Arboleya, economic and financial analyst at the International Energy Agency, called on stakeholders in the global solar industry to focus on emerging markets and developing economies and ISA advisor Kuljit Singh Popli pointed to the World Bank‘s work on improving the bankability of renewables in such markets through policy and market-related approaches. Falling solar costs, added Popli, will accelerate PV adoption but he stressed quality should remain paramount, adding: “A project is as strong as its weakest link so we have to find out the weakest links and then we have to address them.”
State bodies and banks have the power to de-risk renewables and attract investors, said World Bank senior energy specialist Surbhi Goyal.
With the webinar highlighting the crucial role emerging markets will play in the global energy transition, it was pointed out investors must be encouraged to finance clean power projects which include energy storage, as well as backing vital cross-border energy interconnectors.
Dutt wrapped up the session on a positive note, stating: “It is the spirit of cooperation and collaboration that can help us collectively address these common challenges so we can push utility scale renewables in emerging economies, and therefore advance the global energy transition.”
This copy was amended on 03/02/21 to indicate India does not suffer from the lack of a predictable solar development pipeline, as previously indicated.

Nobody can reliably say how long the coronavirus pandemic will keep Germany under its current restrictions, especially trade fair operators, among others.
The organizers of The Smarter E in Munich – Solar Promotion GmbH and Freiburg Wirtschaft Touristik und Messe GmbH & Co. KG (FWTM) – have announced that the event, which includes the four energy fairs Intersolar Europe, Ees Europe, Power2drive Europe, and EM-Power Europe, will be postponed by six weeks.
The new dates are July 21-23, 2021, and the location will remain Messe München. The decision was made in close coordination with the already-registered exhibitors and Messe München, the two organizers said.
“The clear majority of exhibitors are in favor of a postponement to July 21-23, 2021,” the two companies said in a statement. “Six weeks can make a big difference in these times,” explained Markus Elsässer, managing director of Solar Promotion.
He sees the possible advantage that the vaccinations will then have progressed further and travel restrictions on the part of the companies will be reduced. In addition, the summer will help contain the pandemic further. “Currently, over 75% of the space is already booked and we are convinced that we will be able to hold a successful The smarter E Europe 2021 at the end of July 2021 and, at the same time, shape the future of energy supply together with even more renewable energy than ever before,” said FWTM managing director Daniel Strowitzki.
Last year, the fair was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Spain's largest utility, Endesa, a unit of Italian energy company Enel, has submitted to the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (Miteco) a plan to invest approximately €2.9 billion in green hydrogen projects on the Spanish mainland and the country's extra-peninsular regions.
Most of the projects are expected to be located close to, or within the company's thermal power generation assets and they will cover the whole green hydrogen value chain from its production to its consumption. “The 23 green hydrogen projects that we are now presenting are associated with a renewable energy capacity of almost 2,000 MW”, said the general director of generation for Endesa, Rafael González.
This power represents more than half of the 3,900 MW that the company wants to deploy in Spain between 2021 and 2023, according to the update of its strategic plan announced at the end of last November.
All the hydrogen production projects contemplate investment in renewable generation parks dedicated to powering the electrolyzers, although the clean power generation assets will also have the option of injecting electricity into the grid.
In addition, Endesa is also committed to supporting the development of a national industry for the manufacture of electrolyzers and capital goods  associated with the development of its green hydrogen projects.
The most advanced project to date is the one developed in As Pontes, near A Coruña, in the northwestern region of Galicia, which will consist of a 100 MW electrolyzer and six associated wind farms with a combined capacity of 611 MW. Construction of the electrolyzer, which would take about 24 months from its inception, would employ about 120 people. Its operation and maintenance, for about 20 years, would require the work of approximately 100 people. The total investment of the As Pontes project will reach €738 million and the complex will have a green hydrogen production capacity of 10,000 tons per year. 
The rest of the peninsular projects will be implemented in Huelva, Teruel, Almería, Tarragona, the Ebro Valley, Compostilla and Seseña. Overall, the electrolyzers used in these projects will have a combined capacity of of 215 MW.
In total, the projects planned in mainland Spain bring together €2 billion in investment and electrolyzers with an aggregate capacity of 315 MW.
As for the non-peninsular projects, these include schemes in Barranco de Tirajana, Granadilla and Alcudia, for a total electrolyzer capacity of 25 MW and there are other projects in which Endesa is also considering power generation from biofuel and gas.
The projects presented in the Canary Islands, Balearic Islands and Melilla total €900 million in planned investments.
As a whole, the 23 projects proposed by Endesa are diversified in location and the end use of hydrogen: they would be developed in decarbonization and ‘just-transition' areas, island power generation systems, applications in the chemical industry, substitution of thermal power generation, and as fuel for heavy transport. The total production of all of them, once put into operation, would add 26,000 tons of hydrogen per year.

Germany’s federal network agency, the Bundesnetzagentur, has reported that 525 MW of new PV was installed in the country in December.
For comparison, the newly installed PV capacity for December 2019 was 339.4 MW, and in November 2020 it was 480 MW.
In 2020, new PV additions reached 4.88 GW, which means that the country saw its installed PV power increase by around 1 GW more than in 2019, when annual PV additions hit 3.94 GW. In 2018 and 2017, new capacity totaled 2.96 GW and 1.75 GW, respectively.
At the end of the year, Germany boasted a cumulative 53.6 GW of grid-connected solar, installed under national renewable energy laws the Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG).
As a result of the strong growth registered in the past months, all the FITs for PV installations will be reduced by another 1.4%, and will range from €0.0804-0.0553/kWh, depending on the system size. A new digression FIT mechanism has come into force with the recent reform of the EEG.
Under these new provisions, the FITs are maintained for PV sytems up to 300 kW while the owners of PV installations ranging in size from 300 kW to 750 kW are given two different options: building their projects under the tender scheme for utility scale PV – but without being allowed self-consumption; or receiving a FIT – halved compared to smaller systems – but with permission to self-consume the generated energy.

The scheme grants a fixed price for a period of ten years and applies to clean energy projects selected in tenders, such as the 600 MW procurement exercise held in 2013 and the ongoing 1 GW tender recently launched by the Turkish Ministry of Energy.
Winning wind and solar projects will be eligible for a fixed tariff of TRL0.32/kWh ($0.044) while hydropower and geothermal projects will be granted tariffs of TRL0.40/kWh and TRL0.54/kWh, respectively.
Prices will be updated quarterly according to the consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI), as well as any rise in the dollar-euro exchange rate. If the dollar and euro rate decreases, the updated price will not exceed TRL0.51/kWh for PV and wind, TRL0.o64 for hydropower, and TRL0.086 for geothermal energy.
The prices will be applied for 10 years for the licensed power plants that will come into operation from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2025.

The company this morning confirmed it had failed to secure the permission of 90% of holders of the notes to swap them for fresh three-year investments, triggering a default and a cross default at the heavily indebted solar project unit of the business.
GCL will now press ahead with plans to restructure its debts, including by paying out less than 5% of the monies due from the senior notes for the time being.
The company today made a fresh appeal to the note holders who refused to postpone payment of their investments in time to meet a twice-extended deadline which expired on Friday afternoon.
GCL now wants the investors to support a proposed restructure of company debts which would see them receive US$50 for every US$1,000 of notes held plus a pro rata share of a US$17.8 million fund to be divided among the creditors. Under the terms of the restructure – which would allocate a further US$4.5 million specifically to cover the fees of Houlihan Lokey, Hogan Lovells and Moorlander Consulting Limited as advisors to some of the creditors – payment of the outstanding balance due from the notes would be extended until January 30, 2024 anyway, with the defaulted investments exchanged for fresh, 10%, three-year notes.
The note holders have until next Monday to support the proposed restructure – termed the Bermuda scheme in reference to where the company is registered – and GCL today said it has received commitments from the holders of 53% of the investments to support the plan and is confident of it being approved.
In terms of the cross-default non-payment of the notes triggered on Saturday, GCL-Poly and its GCL New Energy solar project development subsidiary said today: “As of the date of this joint announcement, the company has not received any request or notice demanding immediate repayment of its debts under other indebtedness.”
News of the default followed the announcement on Friday of another RMB218 million (US$33.7 million) injection of public money for GCL from the sale of a 50 MW solar project in China to the Beijing United Rongbang entity ultimately controlled by state-owned energy company Beijing Energy Holding Co Ltd.
That project windfall consisted of a sale price of RMB52.5 million which booked an estimated loss of RMB21 million, plus related receivables for GCL from the unit sold.

This means agricultural activities and the energy business may be soon competing for land and this is a conflict that the Israeli government wants to avoid.
For this reason, the Israeli Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Agriculture have joined forces to explore whether agrivoltaic projects can become a feasible solution in the domestic energy market, and have decided to finance, with ILS3.5 million ($1 million) six different studies on how to combine agriculture and solar power generation.
“The dual use of land, for agriculture and the production of solar electricity, is an important step for us,” said Minister of Energy Yuval Steinitz, adding that the commitment to agrivoltaics will be part of the government plan to add 15 GW of PV by 2030.
Solar power generation will be tested on orchards, fields, and greenhouses. One of the six studies, conducted in partnership with the European Union, will investigate the potential of special solar panels for deployment on the roofs of greenhouses and inside the greenhouses themselves. “The aim of the study is to reduce the power consumption of greenhouses in hot areas by 40% or, alternatively, to generate electricity for the grid and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25%,” the Israeli government specified.
Other research will be implemented by the Gilat Research Center for Arid & Semi-Arid Agricultural Research-GCASAR, the Hebrew University, and the Tel Aviv University, among others.
In a recent chat with pv magazine, Eitan Parnass, director of the GEA-IL, said that around 40% of Israel's projected new PV capacity should come from large scale solar, as only installations of this size may ensure the planned gradual phasing out of natural gas combined-cycle plants, which are still the primary source of electricity in the country. He emphasized, however, that Israel is a relatively small country and that land-related issues will arise, and therefore costs will escalate, for the developers of large scale solar PV projects in the years to come.

The Japanese brand issued a press release outlining plans to shutter its Malaysian factory, liquidate its Panasonic Solar Energy Malaysia subsidiary, and lay off staff, by March next year. A company spokesperson subsequently told pv magazine the step had been taken because it had been deemed impossible to maintain cost competitiveness.
The manufacture of solar wafers, cells and modules at the company's domestic fab, in Shimane prefecture, will also cease by the end of the next fiscal year, although no members of the Japanese workforce will be made redundant, with the electricals giant stating: “Employment will be maintained by transferring to other business areas where growth is expected, basically within the factory.” Panasonic confirmed the Shimane fab will continue to manufacture inverters, batteries “and other products.”
The company will continue to sell solar modules with its brand, with their manufacture sub-contracted out. The third-party-manufactured products will be sold in Japan after domestic production ceases, Panasonic stated, as is already the case for overseas markets.
The decision to exit solar manufacturing will also prompt photovoltaic R&D activity at the company's Nishikinohama factory in Kaizuka City, Osaka, to be “downsized,” with “human resources … shifted to other growth areas,” the company added.
Malaysian staff will not be so fortunate, with Panasonic stating it will “support impacted employees with sincerity, providing measures including premium severance payment[s] and outplacement assistance.”
The move comes after Panasonic in August walked away from a projected partnership with Chinese heterojunction module maker GS-Solar which would have seen the Japanese company's Malaysian operation transferred to the Chinese business and a photovoltaic R&D operation established by the two partners. Having announced the potential tie-up in May 2019, Panasonic abandoned the plan five months ago, stating GS-Solar had missed two deadlines to honor its commitments under the partnership, and reserving the right to take legal action against the Chinese company to recover consequent losses.
With the press release issued by Panasonic stating the decision was taken as part of a “structural reform of its photovoltaic business,” pv magazine has written to the company asking for more details about what prompted the change of direction.
The company said, after the collapse of the proposed GS-Solar tie-up in August: “Panasonic will look into every possible measure including new business collaboration with other partners to restore profitability in the solar business by the fiscal year ending March 2023, with more focus on the energy solution business, combining photovoltaic modules, [the company's] HEMS*1 [Home Energy Management System product] and storage batteries.”
This copy was amended on 01/02/21 to include details of the proposed GS-Solar collaboration which fell through. It was further amended, on 03/02/21, to address the comment from Panasonic about cost competitiveness.

The new scheme replaced the NEM 2.0 program that was introduced in January 2019 and expired at the end of 2020. The 500MW quota under the NEM 2.0 scheme was fully subscribed by the end of December. “All existing NEM 2.0 draft applications that couldn’t secure quota by 31st December 2020 will be removed from the dedicated platform during the maintenance period,” the Seda specified.
The NEM 3.0 program will be in force until the end of 2023 and will be aimed at allocating 500 MW of rooftop PV capacity.
This quota will be assigned through three different sub-schemes: the NEM Rakyat program for residential systems, which will allocate 100 MW and grant a net metering tariff over a 10-year period; the NEM GoMEn regime for government ministries and public entities, through which another 100 MW will be assigned under the same conditions as the NEM Rakyat; and the 300 MW NEM Nova scheme, or Net Offset Virtual Aggregation, which will enable commercial and industrial PV system owners to sell excess power to the grid at market price or system marginal price (SMP). In the Malaysian electricity market, the SMP is given by the price of the most expensive marginal generator scheduled or dispatched to meet demand in the half-hour period.
Net metering replaced Malaysia's feed-in tariff incentive scheme in January 2016. In May 2017, Malaysia made the system more attractive and in 2019, with the NEM 2.0 program, the surplus power generated by the PV system was for the first time paid on a “one-on-one” offset basis, which meant that every kilowatt-hour injected into the network was offset against a kilowatt-hour of electricity taken from the grid. Under the previous regime, exported energy carried less value than consumed grid power.
At the end of 2019, the country had around 882 MW of installed solar generation capacity, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The Malaysian government is also supporting large-scale PV through a series of tenders, the latest of which was launched in May.

France's energy regulator the Commission de Régulation de l'Énergie (CRE) has published the feed-in tariffs for rooftop PV systems with a generation capacity of up to 100 kW, for the first quarter of 2021.
The FIT levels are reduced quarter by quarter according to the new capacity for which connection requests were received in the previous three-month period. Different tariffs are applied depending on the system sizes and the project location, which can be either on the French mainland, Corsica, or on the nation's overseas territories.
The FIT payments, indicated in megawatt-hours, are summarized in the CRE table reproduced below, which also reveals the net metering payments for excess power sold back to the grid – outlined in the bottom half of the graphic.

For those PV system owners that will opt for selling all generated power to the grid, the FIT was slightly lowered, from €0.1797 to €0.1793/kWh for small-sized arrays not exceeding 3 kW in size; and from €0.1527 to €0.1524/kWh for installations with a capacity of 3-9 kW. Furthermore, the FIT for PV systems ranging in power from 9-36 kW had been reduced from €0.1135 to €0.1123/kWh, and that for projects with a capacity between 36 and 100 kW has been decreased from €0.0987 to €0.0976/kWh.
In France’s non-interconnected regions, FIT payments were also slightly reduced.
As the CRE table below illustrates, the Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte will be eligible for a FIT of €0.1613/kWh while France’s South American territory of Guiana will receive a FIT payment of €0.1528/kWh; the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique have been assigned each a FIT of €0.1443/kWh; the Indian Ocean outpost of Réunion will receive a tariff of 0.1358/kWh; and Corsica will have the right to the lowest FIT payment, of €0.1287/kWh.

The dual passivation was achieved by integrating europium (Eu3+) ions in both layers in a one-step process. These ions are said to be able to reduce defects in both layers and, as a result, to improve the photovoltaic properties of the MAPbI3. Europium and tin ions were simultaneously deposited to form films on FTO (Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide) glass, which is a transparent conductive metal oxide that is commonly used in the fabrication of transparent electrodes for solar cells.
“We observed directional diffusion of Eu3+ from the Tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) ETL to the MAPbI3 perovskite film, which leads to accumulation of large amount of Eu3+ at the perovskite/ETL interface,” the Chinese group explained. “The champion fabricated perovskite solar cell attains a PCE as high as 20.14%, and, when exposed to the ambient atmosphere, the unsealed perovskite solar cell presents a slow degradation by only 13% after 84 days.” The cell also showed an improved fill factor, due to the reduced trap density in perovskite film, and higher open-circuit voltage, thanks to the lower reduced energy loss in MAPbI3.
The academics emphasized that the aggregation of europium ions at the interface between the perovskite and SnO2 films is the key factor improving electron transport through the interface by reducing the charge accumulation. Furthermore, the europium ions are responsible for reducing perovskite degradation by preventing moisture permeation.
The proposed approach was presented in the study Dual Passivation of Perovskite and SnO2 for High‐Efficiency MAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells, published in Advanced Science.

The company said the solar park will be grid-connected within the next 12 months. Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck will buy the electricity generated by the solar park at an undisclosed price. “The agreement is a hedge against rising electricity costs as it entails a low fixed cost of electricity for the next seven years,” Better Energy said in a statement. “Danish solar power is now more cost-effective than fossil energy.”
No more details were released on the solar project and the power supply deal.
Better Energy has already built a 50 MW solar project under a long-term power purchase agreement in Denmark that is powering an Apple data center in Viborg. Furthermore, Danish clothing company Bestseller announced in 2019 it was partnering with independent power producer Better Energy for the construction of a 125 MW solar facility to power its operations.

The scientists utilized standard carbon paper electrodes (CP) modified with electrophoretically deposited nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G), which they claim are capable of meeting the electrochemical requirements of the hybrid redox flow cells (HRFCs). These cells are key components for the development of reliable large-scale redox flow storage systems and usually consist of an electrochemical cell, a storage tank, and a hydrogen or oxygen gas cylinder.
The high cost of HRFCs, as well as low cycle performance, and incompatibilities associated with the commonly used carbon-based electrodes, however, have so far limited their commercial viability. “For cost-effectiveness and maximizing the benefits of RFBs and HRFCs, they need to be operated at higher current densities, as this can effectively reduce the size and number of cells per stack,” the researchers stated. “This basically depends on how efficiently HRFC electrodes are engineered in terms of their microstructural features and the extent to which they can cope with their harsh operating conditions.”
The academics applied the hybrid electrodes to three types of HRFCs: a hydrogen/vanadium (RHVFC) device; a hydrogen/manganese (RHMnFC) cell; and a polysulfide/air (S-Air) device. A binder-free horizontal electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique was used to activate the electrodes. EPD is a two-step process enabling the particles suspended in a colloid solution to be collected onto a substrate. According to the scientists, this technique is a binderless process with precise control of few-layer graphene particles deposition with the exclusion of graphene aggregates. “Carbon paper (CP) acting as a gas diffusion layer (SGL 10AA, henceforth termed SGL) was used as the positive electrode for both the RHVFC and RHMnFC and as the negative electrode for S-A ir cells,” they explained.
Tests were conducted to compare the electrochemical performance of the three electrodes with that of commercially available liquid–liquid, all-vanadium RFBs. “We have demonstrated that these electrodes are capable of meeting the harsh electrochemical requirements for these HRFCs, evidenced by their enhanced performance and operability, attributed to the high specificity of these electrodes coming from the synergistic effects of enhanced electrochemical surface area, chemical/electrochemical stability, and catalytic activity,” the UK group concluded. “Furthermore, the estimated system cost shows that HRFCs are potentially low-cost alternatives to the commercial standard VRFB.”
Looking forward, the academics are planning to optimize the HRFCs by replacing conventional carbon electrodes with N-G-modified electrodes or free-standing hierarchical nanomaterial structures. Their findings were presented in the study Hybrid Redox Flow Cells with Enhanced Electrochemical Performance via Binderless and Electrophoretically Deposited Nitrogen-Doped Graphene on Carbon Paper Electrodes, published in ACS Publications.

Australia is keen to corner the hydrogen market. As a nation, Australia has excessive natural resources of wind and solar that will generate the green hydrogen set to become the fuel of the century. Australia also has non-renewable resources that can generate hydrogen of the grey and blue variety, however, the sheer cost advantage of solar and wind is expected to out-compete grey and blue hydrogen by as soon as 2030.
This is why Goldman Sachs has called green hydrogen a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” and estimated that green hydrogen alone (not including grey and blue) “could give rise to a €10 trillion addressable market globally by 2050 for the utility industry alone.”
So it is no surprise that National Energy Resources Australia (NERA), an industry-led not-for-profit organization set up in 2015 as part of the federal government’s Industry Growth Centre initiative, is investing in an Australian-wide network of regional hydrogen technology clusters. According to a statement from NERA: “Technology Clusters are geographic concentrations of interconnected businesses and organizations in a particular field, that both collaborate and compete to increase productivity and innovation.”
NERA is investing an initial $1.75 million in 13 clusters of industry experts, universities, energy companies, renewables hubs and development committees across all states and territories that will work together to establish Australia’s global identity in the hydrogen economy and foster billions of dollars in growth.
According to the 2019 National Hydrogen Strategy: “A key element of Australia’s approach will be to create hydrogen hubs – clusters of large-scale demand.”
Combined, the various regional clusters form a national cluster that will operate as a virtual network spearheaded by NERA. The goal of the network is to establish Australian hydrogen technology and expertise as a recognized global brand. Which is to say that the goal is to establish as a global norm that if you want to know about hydrogen, look to Australia.
Moreover, these hydrogen clusters will also help in the development of hydrogen supply chains, deployment, identify developmental missteps, and the commercialization of new hydrogen tech.
NERA CEO Miranda Taylor said that these 13 regional clusters are a crucial step in building the skills, capacities, and commercialization opportunities necessary to unlock Australia’s enormous potential to create a globally competitive hydrogen industry that, according to a 2019 Deloitte report, could increase Australia’s GDP up to $26 billion.
“Today marks a great step forward in Australia’s capability in developing hydrogen technologies,” said Taylor. “These regional clusters, all of which have the support of their state and territory governments, have been established around key, existing hydrogen projects and technology supply chains in strategic locations that have a demonstrated capacity to support them.”
The announcement is a direct result of action accorded in the National Hydrogen Strategy which instructed NERA to “support small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to take advantage of opportunities in the hydrogen industry by forming an industry-led hydrogen cluster…This will maximize economic benefits by ensuring Australian companies are well placed to supply new technology, products and services to Australia’s hydrogen industry and export markets.”
According to Taylor this national cluster “will ensure long-term local cohesion and sustainable capability across the emerging hydrogen value chain.”
The clusters are as follows:

PV module production is increasingly changing from mono-facial to bifacial panels as the production gains and resulting project returns from bifacial panels are being validated. Many sources are projecting that bifacial production will overtake mono-facial within the next three to five years.
In order to maximize production returns, we at 7X Energy are starting to change our panel selection exclusively to bifacial. Due to this shift, we are evaluating the largest contributor of bifacial gain, the albedo or reflectivity of the ground surface.
In this evaluation, we tried to figure out how we could artificially increase gain for our project sites. The engineering team at 7X Energy performed research on commercially available ground material that would increase the ground albedo of its bifacial PV solar plants currently in construction.
(Read “Satellite-derived datasets to measure ground albedo for bifacial PV” from pv magazine Global.)
In addition, the team performed an economic analysis on a selected white ground cover and modeled the resultant production boost using PVsyst to take advantage of production gains from using bifacial solar panels mounted on single-axis trackers.
Here we share the results of the financial modeling analysis of two 7X Energy projects (the 200 MW Taygete II and the 130 MW Elara facilities) and offer some insights about the project feasibility economic modeling exercise.
After extensive research and analysis on albedo enhancing materials, we selected a woven polypropylene white ground cover manufactured by DeWitt Co. [Ref. 1] which is typically used in agricultural ground cover applications.
The 3.2 ounce/ sq. yd. material is a UV stabilized fabric and permeable. The material is expected to last five years based on the manufacturer and is shipped in rolls with dimensions of 12’ x 300’. This material was selected based on durability, permeability, cost, and availability among other criteria.
Our analysis was based on covering the entire surface area below the panels and between trackers as a means to providing the highest increase in yield. Previous research and analysis conducted and presented by Canadian Solar showed this scenario provided the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) vs. other surface area covering scenarios [Ref. 2]. The only areas not covered were main access roads, inverter access roads, and the buffer between the trackers and project fence line.
For the financial analysis we assumed two scenarios: one that would not include the 30% ITC qualification and one that would. All economic modeling was based on the material’s 5-year expected life.
We also adjusted the modeled albedo as we expected the material to show a reflectivity reduction as the material aged and broke down. The resultant production gains were multiplied by the indicative modeled price ($30/MWh) to show increased revenue. Then, we added additional budget to the operational expense since we expected some wear and tear from maintenance techs, weather, and so on. We also assumed the annual expenses at 10% of the total capital cost for the material. And last, we included operational savings from the reduction of vegetation management due to the ground cover.
We started the project net present value (NPV) analysis on our Taygete II project, which is currently under construction in West Texas. Project details included 1.29DC/AC ratio, 0.226 measured average ground albedo, 0.26% ground coverage ratio (GCR), and 1 in portrait orientation single axis tracker. Below is the summary of the financial NPV modeling for the project.

Based on the initial capital expense of roughly $4.2 million and cash flow over 5 years, we showed a negative NPV of around $2.8 million. When we assumed that the project would qualify for the 30% ITC, we still had a negative NPV on the order of $1.6 million. This was not the result we were hoping for, but we continued further modeling on additional projects.
The second project was our Elara project currently under construction in South Central Texas. The Elara project has a 1.35 DC/AC ratio, 0.185 measured average ground albedo, 30% GCR, and 1 in portrait orientation single axis tracker. Below is the summary of the financial NPV modeling for the project.

The first thing that stood out was that we still had a negative NPV although it was significantly closer to breaking even than our Taygete II project. Since the projects offer different capacities, we compared the project returns on IRR, which are -5% for Elara vs -24% for Taygete II assuming no ITC. Elara showed more economic feasibility, so we took a closer look to better understand the difference.

First, the delta in the initial albedo vs. the modeled albedo is higher for the Elara site. This accounted for the initial annual production gain of 4.3% vs. 3.4% at the Taygete site. Next, the GCR was higher for Elara, thus reducing the amount of surface area that the ground material covered and lowering the capital expenditure (CapEx).
Last, we had a significant savings in our operational costs because we assumed four mows per year at Elara versus just two mows per year at Taygete II. This was due to the vegetation on site and also the precipitation at the specific locations. This led to an overall annual operations savings of $95,000 at Elara vs. annual operations expenses of $136,000 at Taygete II.
From this comparison, we concluded that lower initial albedo sites, higher GCRs, and sites with at least average U.S. precipitation provide more favorable NPV returns for this albedo-enhancing material.
Based on the results of our financial modeling exercise, it appears the material does not deliver the project returns we would like.
However, we wanted to understand what site characteristics could potentially provide the positive NPV we are looking to achieve, and model some sensitivities in the financial modeling inputs that we could change.
For this analysis, we used the Elara financial model as the basis, or baseline, and calculated the change (delta) in NPV for each isolated site characteristic to determine the gain in NPV vs. the baseline. We started with the baseline of a -$898,000 NPV; the results shown below are in NPV gain ranking order of highest NPV delta.

From the results, we see that the ability to capture the ITC had the highest impact on NPV, with a gain of $725,000. When we added this to the baseline – $898,000, we had a net -$173,000 NPV. This matched our Elara project modeling.
The second-highest NPV delta was a scenario in which we required two additional mows/year (for a total of 6 per year) along with limited herbicide treatments. In this scenario we gained $682,000 of NPV. Adding the ability to capture 30% ITC resulted in a positive NPV of $509,000. That is finally an encouraging value!
By adding just these two items (the 30% ITC and 2 extra mows), the ground material proved to be worth pursuing for further study and possible implementation.
The third-highest NPV is the material ground cover O&M. Here, we adjusted the operating expense from 10% to 5% of total CapEx per year. We lack operating cost tools and experience to provide a confident cost for this item, but we believe an opportunity exists to adjust it down to 5%.
Fourth on the graph is the project’s power price. We assumed competitive pricing in the model, but a number of project sites within the U.S. and internationally that have significantly higher contracted prices versus the $30/MWh that we modeled.
Following that, the ground cover life variable had a $449,000 NPV gain. Here, we assumed the ground cover lasted two more years than the expected 5-year life.
Ground coverage ratio is shown next. Increasing the GCR by 5% (in other words, decreasing the tracker row spacing and thus the plant’s surface area), we increased the NPV by $448,000. Based on our experience, 35% GCR is a more common GCR in the U.S. vs. the lower GCRs we were able to achieve with our Taygete II and Elara sites. This figure has a high potential to be included in many projects.
Moving farther to the right, we have a positive $401,000 NPV gain based on a 33% reduction in the labor to install the ground material. We think there are some labor efficiencies that could be gained in deploying the material, hence the potential for this reduction. Note, however, that if we had a higher albedo–such as 0.23–then a $308,000 loss in NPV would have occurred.
One item that stood out was the mediocre production gain with this high albedo ground cover. We expected significantly higher yields with the white ground cover-modeled albedo. When we further analyzed the PVsyst production loss breakdown, we found that the inverter AC clipping was excessively high: 5.6% vs 2.4% in year 1 on Elara for the 0.55 and 0.185 modeled albedo, respectively.
The excessive inverter AC clipping was due to the increased irradiance with the ground cover, particularly during the middle of the day. Thus informed, we redesigned the project assuming the new approach, and included the ground cover installed and optimized for the increased irradiance. This resulted in a new DC/AC ratio of 1.25 vs. the previous 1.35. We re-ran the NPV modeling and generated a -$290,000 total NPV project vs. the -$898,000 baseline.
So, even with an optimized design, we still came up short of a positive NPV. However, if we can take advantage of any of the variables noted in the NPV graph, then the additional NPV gain will net us a positive NPV project.
We arrived at three main conclusions when evaluating the opportunity to install an artificial albedo enhancing ground cover.
The ground cover material showed a lot of promise. But even if a project with notable positive NPV were identified, some testing still is required to prove the long-term durability, degradation rates, and validation of the installation labor and O&M.
We look forward to working with industry partners to further review and analyze–and hopefully deploy–this material on one of our bifacial projects in the near future.
