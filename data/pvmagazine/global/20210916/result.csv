A notice issued by Tennet to regulator the Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) stated the electric grid company would have to split the Flevoland-Gelderland-Utrecht 150 kV network into at least four sections, each with a connection to the 380 kV grid; install new transformers to raise 150/380 kV transformation capacity; and possibly upgrade 150 kV connections in the areas affected.
Issuing the official notice of the problem this month, Tennet said 4.8 GW of solar and wind generation capacity was either already in place or under development in Gelderland and Flevopolder – the equivalent of six conventional power plants – and all of the regional network's 5.6 GW electricity transmission capacity has been contracted out.
The grid company, which also serves customers in Germany, said adding transformers at Dodewaard, Doetinchem, and Lelystad, “among other places,” would take place in 2026-29. The company told the ACM, upgrading the network would take three to seven years and energy bottlenecks should be anticipated from this year until 2029.
Tennet said it “is expected to invest” €450 million in upgrading the grid in the areas concerned and also said it was exploring network congestion management using “a method based on the electricity market to create more space on the grid and at the same time prevent overloading of the electricity network.” That has previously referred to potentially offering incentives to generators to curtail output during periods of congestion.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/16/skyrocketing-energy-carbon-prices-already-make-green-hydrogen-competitive/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,EUROPE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2021","Skyrocketing energy, carbon prices already make green hydrogen competitive","Electricity and gas prices are skyrocketing globally and the tipping point for this unprecedented trend is still not in sight. This situation is putting the entire world economy under strong pressure, and could also cause financial trouble for many energy-intensive companies over the short term.
According to Antonio Delgado Rigal, chief executive of Spanish energy forecasting service AleaSoft, large-scale renewables and the PPA market immediately offer a feasible solution for big energy consumers to get out of trouble, at least in part. And green hydrogen represents the best alternative to gas over the long term, as it is increasingly taking a leading role in the global electricity market.
“With increasing energy demand and with gas replacing coal in many countries where the latter is being phased out, we are heading toward a perfect storm. And it is not clear when we can get out of it,” Delgado Rigal tells pv magazine.

This trend has been in place for while, but we were still in a “normal” context up until July, as price decreases in the short term were still considered possible, he says.
“Since then, gas and electricity prices have been growing at an unprecedented speed and nobody can say at the moment when this will be over,” he explains. “Now, gas prices are increasing exponentially. And not only in European markets, but also in the Americas and Asia, which means that this is a global matter. This is not about Russia, Algeria or Iran anymore … because we are seeing more gas consumption than gas production and, as a consequence, future gas prices are also rising.”
Delgado Rigal says that the simultaneous increase in carbon prices, especially in Europe, could become another factor pushing big energy consumers closer to serious financial issues. “I believe that a one-year moratorium may be introduced for both generators and intensive-energy consumers and this would help provide some relief under these dramatic circumstances,” he says. “This situation may lead to dramatic implications and, eventually, a global economic crisis. However, this is also showing the importance of investing more in solar, renewables and green hydrogen.”
Delgado Rigal is convinced that from a long-term perspective, green hydrogen could significantly reduce dependence on gas.
“In the short term, of course, green hydrogen is not immediately available, but if we consider the current gas price and add it to the carbon price, we can already say that green hydrogen is already competitive,” he says. “If we had implemented faster big green hydrogen production, we would probably not be under the threat of a global crisis. This energy price crisis is a great opportunity for renewables, solar and green hydrogen. It is only about getting greener – this makes us independent from gas.”
Looking at what is happening in different European countries, Delgado Rigal explained that UK and Italy, which are currently seeing the highest energy prices, are the most dependent on gas supplies. France, which is in theory well protected by its huge nuclear power plant fleet, is also seeing electricity prices increase significantly.
“Around 25% of France's electricity is made with gas and other sources and the gas and CO2 prices are also having an impact on this energy market,” Delgado Rigal adds. “France is constantly buying and selling power to other countries, thanks to its nuclear capacity, and this brings into balance the entire European market, but if they had a completely isolated electricity network, they would have lower electricity prices.”
When asked what kind of immediate actions the renewable energy industry may take to take advantage of this crisis, Delgado Rigal says that power futures for 2031 are currently being sold at around €30/MWh, which he describes as a great opportunity for big energy consumers, as they could close very profitable PPAs with a 10-year duration.
“In Spain, we are currently seeing PPAs for solar being closed at prices close to this level,” he explains. “Solar developers are scared of power futures and price cannibalization and big consumers are often shortsighted, but it is time to act now.”
All the big corporations that have secured PPAs over the past few years are currently making big savings compared to all those who are still reluctant, as they now face prices of approximately €150/MWh.
“When electricity prices dropped to their all-time low during the first Covid-19 crisis in the first half of 2020, several big energy consumers that had previously signed PPAs wanted to back-pedal, as they bought power for €40/MWh, but prices at the time were close to €20/MWh,” Delgado Rigal says, noting that this short-term strategy does not consider that what we are experiencing now is an unprecedented crisis. “This is a global tsunami and if this doesn't stop, many energy consumers may have to face bankruptcy, as governments have no tools to mitigate its effects.”
He argues that public investments in renewable energy infrastructure and green hydrogen will be crucial to address the crisis.
“We have a lot of renewable energy available – we just have to increase its consumption via green hydrogen and action can be taken immediately,” he states. “Hydrogen will inevitably replace gas as a fuel and, as much as gas prices remain at this level, this process will be accelerated.”
On the other hand, he adds, green hydrogen is already competitive, given the current price situation.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/16/solar-on-new-build-homes-has-significantly-shorter-payback-period/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,CALIFORNIA,FRANCE,NEW JERSEY,SPAIN,WORLD",MAX HALL,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2021",Solar on new-build homes has significantly shorter payback period,"The compelling economic case for global policymakers to follow the lead set by California in mandating solar on newly-built homes has been laid out in a report by U.S. analyst Bloomberg New Energy Finance and French electrical equipment company Schneider Electric.
The Realizing the Potential of Customer-sited Solar study claims the five-year payback period for solar arrays retrofitted onto buildings in the Golden State is halved for systems installed at the initial construction stage of buildings, because of reductions in marketing, sales, labor and construction costs. Thus, according to yesterday's report, solar systems on new-builds in California can offer an internal rate of return (IRR) of 40% per year on their investment cost, rather than 20% IRR offered by retrofitted systems.
BloombergNEF and Schneider have calculated the 18.5% IRR for retrofitted solar systems in France could rise to as much as 28% if photovoltaics were to be made compulsory on new-build homes.
The thrust of the report is the need for legislators to introduce policies to unlock global rooftop solar potential which, the authors of the study claim, could drive 2 TW of household and commercial on-site solar by mid century, plus around 1 TWh of local energy storage.
France and California, together with Spain, Australia, and the U.S. state of New Jersey, were examined in the study, with the authors noting successful incentives had helped drive around 500 MW of rooftop PV in the former market by last year, with French businesses able to enjoy a nine-year payback for on-site commercial systems. The economics of home solar in Australia have prompted a wave of more than 2.5 GW of residential arrays.
The ability of residential and commercial energy storage systems to enable on-site solar to help balance the grid should also prompt politicians to encourage batteries, said BloombergNEF and Schneider, with policy nudges suggested including adjusted rates paid by utilities for excess power exported to the grid; time-of-use electricity prices, “aggregation” payments to homes and businesses for use of their storage systems; and demand charges levied on businesses for consuming electricity during peak hours.
In a nod to the initial feed-in tariffs offered for solar electricity in many markets as the technology first emerged – most of which were withdrawn at short notice, with some governments retroactively reneging upon contracts – the report cautioned legislators against laying down incentives which could fuel “an unsustainable boom,” given solar and storage technology appears set to get cheaper over time.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/16/italy-deployed-362-mw-of-pv-in-h1/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2021",Italy deployed 362 MW of PV in H1,"Italy installed around 362.4 MW of solar in the first six months of this year, according to new figures from ANIE Rinnovabili, and additional data from grid operator Terna.
This result compares to 259 MW in the first half of 2020 and 231 MW in the same period a year earlier. The 2020 statistics, however, did not include a 103 MW solar plant that Danish developer European Energy built in the southern region of Apulia and which began commercial operations in late June of last year. This means that the newly installed capacity for the first half of this year is almost the same as that deployed in the first six months of 2020.
Most of this year's capacity was installed in the second quarter, when PV systems totaling 210.6 MW were connected to the Italian grid.
According to the latest statistics, PV projects that do not exceed 1 MW in size represented almost all of the newly deployed capacity, at 325.3 MW. Solar parks over 1 MW only accounted for 37.1 MW of the total. The increasing success of rooftop PV is currently being ensured by the 110% fiscal break for rooftop PV linked to building renovations. The so-called “super-bonus” for building renovation projects, which was introduced in May 2020 to help revive the country’s economy from the Covid-19 crisis, was recently extended through 2022.
Residential PV systems up to 20 kW in size still accounted for the largest share, at around 163.6 MW of capacity. PV systems ranging from 20 kW to 100 kW accounted for 66.1 MW of the total. Meanwhile, commercial and industrial PV installations ranging from 100 kW to 1 MW hit 95.5 MW in the first six months of the year.
The parts of the country with the highest development volumes were the Lombardy region, which brought 66.8 MW of new solar online, and the northern region of Veneto, with 64.2 MW. Sicily and Emilia-Romagna finished the first half of the year with 32.0 MW and 41.4 MW, respectively.
The provisional figures indicate that Italy exceeded 22.4 GW of solar capacity at the end of June. The nation’s National Integrated Plan for Climate and Energy aims for 50 GW of solar by 2030.

Originally planned to have a capacity of 2 GWh, the factory is expected to begin manufacturing activities in 2026 and to produce lithium-ion batteries based on a technology developed by South Korean manufacturer, Enertech International of which Rosatom acquired a 49% stake in March.
“The signals we receive from the Russian market indicate that the production volumes we planned a year ago may be insufficient. To fulfill the current plans for electric transport development, we are considering a possible growth of the plant's production capacity up to 12 GWh,” said Emin Askerov, the general director of Rosatom's unit Renera, which will own and operate the factory.
“The plant’s production is supposed to be consumed mainly by domestic car manufacturers, therefore the enterprise will make a significant contribution to implementation of the state policy of import substitution,” said Natalia Nikipelova, president of TVEL Fuel Company (TVEL), which Rosatom set up in October to enter the energy storage business.
TVEL already produces module-type lithium-ion traction batteries for electric vehicles, as well as energy storage systems for emergency power supplies, renewable energy resources, and the smoothing of load demand.
The Russian state-owned conglomerate's nuclear power plants currently cover around 20% of Russia's total electricity demand.

Goldi Solar, which recently unveiled its HELOC̣ Pro series – featuring monofacial and bifacial modules based on M10 (182 mm x 182 mm) wafers – aims to expand its product lineup. It plans to start producing 210 mm modules from next year. 
Managing Director Capt Ishver Dholakiya told pv magazine that the company will start commercial production of 182 mm HELOC modules in November. The modules have a 21.7% efficiency rating and a power output of 560 Wp. The company plans to make the modules with even larger wafer sizes (210 mm) from next year.
Currently, Goldi Solar has 500 MW of module capacity. It plans to increase it to 2 GW, including cells and modules, under the Indian government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme. 
“There is ample market for all module manufacturers, including the new entrants, as the government has set ambitious solar targets,” said Dholakiya. 
About 60% of Goldi Solar’s sales revenue comes from the commercial and industrial solar segment and the market solar pumps. Dholakiya said there is a big opportunities in this space.

Conceived for applications in PV windows, the non-fullerene cell was fabricated with the polymer PCE-10 as a donor, and a near-infrared (NIR) absorbing, non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) known as BT-CIC, in an inverter design acceptor-donor-acceptor. “Non-fullerene acceptors cause very high efficiency but contain weak bonds that easily dissociate under high energy photons, especially the UV [ultraviolet] photons common in sunlight,” said researcher Yongxi Li, noting that these photons affect the device's durability.
In order to solve this issue, the research team needed to prevent UV photons hitting the cell and, for this purpose, they placed a zinc oxide (ZnO) layer on the front side of the device. “The ZnO layer (of around 30nm) was spin cast from a ZnO precursor solution onto the substrates and then thermally annealed at 150 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes in air,” the scientists explained.
This layer is able to conduct the solar-generated electrons to the electrode, thus mitigating the issue with UV photons but, at the same time, it affects the performance of the self-assembled monolayer used in the device, and a layer of a carbon-based material called IC-SAM had to be added as a buffer. Furthermore, a layer made of fullerene material known as C70 was applied at the electron and hole transporting layer interfaces. “To prevent chemical and morphological changes at organic/inorganic interfaces over time, buffer layers are inserted between the bulk-heterojuncton and charge transporting layers for improving the stability of the contact interface,” the scientists explained, noting that the cell was also encapsulated in a ‘glovebox' filled with ultra-high purity nitrogen.

The solar cell was tested under one-sun intensity with AM1.5 G irradiation for 1,900 hours at 55 degrees Celsius and lost only 6% of its efficiency, which shows, the U.S. group stated, that the device may still achieve an efficiency of 80% at the end of an estimated lifetime of 30 years.
The research team believes that the cell efficiency may be raised to 15% with a higher degree of transparency and that the device may be further improved by preparing the used materials as liquids. “Our results show that NFA-based solar cells have the potential to meet the market needs of high reliability, in addition to their high efficiency and potentially low manufacturing costs,” they concluded.
A completed description of the cell and the manufacturing method can be found in the paper Non-fullerene acceptor organic photovoltaics with intrinsic operational lifetimes over 30 years, published in nature communications.
The transparent organic solar cell was initially unveiled in 2017, when the research group said the materials used needed to adjust to the ultraviolet and near infrared wavelengths which are processed into electricity in the device. “Highly transparent solar cells represent the wave of the future for new solar applications,” said researcher Richard Lunt at the time. “We analyzed their potential and show that by harvesting only invisible light, these devices can provide a similar electricity-generation potential as rooftop solar, while providing additional functionality to enhance the efficiency of buildings, automobiles and mobile electronics.”
The group estimated that up to 7 billion square meters of glass surface in the U.S. could be covered by the material, with the potential of supplying 40% of energy demand in the U.S.

Stanwell, an electricity generator in the Australian state of Queensland, will work with Japan’s largest hydrogen supplier, Iwatani Corp., on a AUD 10.4 million ($7.6 million) feasibility study to investigate the commercial viability of developing a 3 GW electrolysis plant at Gladstone, with the view of producing green hydrogen for export to Japan and use in local industry.
When built, the proposed green hydrogen project would be the largest in Queensland. Commencing production in the mid-2020s, it would scale up to more than 3 GW of electrolysis capacity by the early 2030s. The project aims to produce up to 36,500 tons per year of renewable hydrogen and export to Japan from 2026, scaling up to 328,500 tons per annum in 2031 to meet predicted demand.
Iwatani, which supplies 70% of Japan’s hydrogen market, has already worked with Stanwell on the completion of a planning study for the project. They will now launch a detailed feasibility study to examine the commercial viability of the project.
The study is being supported by investment from a broader consortium, including Sydney-based energy infrastructure business APA Group and Japanese companies Kansai Electric Power Corp., Marubeni, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The consortium partners, which have expertise across the hydrogen supply chain – including renewable energy, hydrogen production, liquefaction, shipping and offtake – will provide financial contributions towards the feasibility study.
Stanwell's acting CEO, Adam Aspinall, said the involvement of international and Australian counterparts would be critical in developing the state’s emerging hydrogen industry.
“While there’s still a way to go for hydrogen to be commercial, collaboration with key partners across all parts of the supply chain is critical to helping drive down the cost of hydrogen technologies and supporting the development of the industry,” he said.
Stanwell has already secured a 236-hectare site at Aldoga, west of Gladstone, for the hydrogen production base. A 100-hectare site is to be acquired at the port of Gladstone to serve as a hydrogen liquefaction and loading base. The project ultimately aims to export green hydrogen in liquid form to Japan, as well as supply large industrial customers in the central Queensland region.
APA Chief Executive and Managing Director Rob Wheals said the region is ideally suited for the renewable energy project, as it experiences favorable weather conditions for more than 300 days a year.
“Queensland has some of the best sun and wind resources in Australia, making it well placed to not only develop an export hydrogen supply chain, but demonstrate the benefits of unlocking green hydrogen in our regions,” he said. “Australia’s advantages in hydrogen are enormous and this project could be a game-changer in helping Queensland develop a hydrogen industry at scale.”
The project has attracted financial support from the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which this week awarded the project up to AUD 2.17 million in funding.
The feasibility study will examine production technology, the construction of hydrogen liquefaction plants and liquefied hydrogen carriers, associated finance and environmental assessments, and commercialization models. ARENA Chief Executive Darren Miller said the study presents a “significant opportunity” to accelerate the development of export opportunities for renewable hydrogen in Australia.
“Australia’s vast solar and wind resources and our proven ability to export energy products mean we are well placed to build a large-scale competitive hydrogen export industry in the future,” he said. “Feasibility studies like this are a necessary and crucial step to build the case to attract the finance required for large, impactful projects.”
The study marks another step in the transition of the central Queensland region from a traditional coal and gas hub to a green hydrogen hotspot. Earlier this year, London-based  Eco Energy World announced plans for a 200 MW green hydrogen plant with 100 MW of energy storage in Gladstone, while Japanese trading giant Sumitomo also plans to build a hydrogen production plant in the region.
Spanish renewable energy developer Acciona Energía is also eyeing the region, last month revealing it had received approval to expand its Aldoga Solar Farm from 250 MW to 600 MWp to support the development of Gladstone’s green hydrogen hub.
Gladstone also recently joined the National Energy Resources Australia (NERA) network of hydrogen technology clusters, which seeks to seed innovation and productivity by interconnecting players in the hydrogen field.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/16/how-long-do-residential-solar-inverters-last/,"INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2021",How long do residential solar inverters last?,"From pv magazine USA
In the first part of this series, pv magazine reviewed  the productive lifespan of solar panels, which are quite resilient. In this part, we examine residential solar inverters in their various forms, and look at their resiliency and how long they last.
The inverter, a device that converts the DC power produced by solar panels into usable AC power, can come in a few different configurations. 
The two main types of inverters in residential applications are string inverters and microinverters. In some applications, string inverters are equipped with module-level power electronics (MLPE), or DC optimizers. Microinverters and DC optimizers are generally used for rooftops with shading conditions or sub-optimal orientations (not facing south).
The technology ensures that each panel produces its max capability in real time and isn’t limited to the weakest link in the chain, or “string.” String inverters are subject to the “Christmas light” effect, where if one panel is not performing or is shaded, the rest of the panels connected in series will be limited to that panel’s production level.
Some string inverters are equipped with a bypass diode, a technology that prevents the “Christmas light” effect from taking place altogether, shown here by Fronius.
In applications where the roof has a preferable azimuth (orientation to the sun) and little or no shading issues, a string inverter can be a good solution.
In a string inverter, there are fewer moving parts to break down, less complicated wiring, and a centralized location for easy repairs for solar technicians.  Typically they are less expensive, said Solar Reviews. It said that inverters can typically cost 10% to 20% of the total solar panel installation, so choosing the right one is important.
How long do they last? 
While solar panels can last 25 to 30 years or more, inverters generally have a shorter life, due to more rapidly aging components. A common source of failure in inverters is wear and weathering on the capacitors in the inverter. The electrolyte capacitors have a shorter lifetime and age faster than dry components, said Solar Harmonics.
EnergySage said that a typical centralized residential string inverter will last about 10 to 15 years, and thus will need to be replaced at some point during the panels’ life. String inverters  generally have standard warranties ranging from five to 10 years, and many have the option to extend to 20 years. Some solar contracts include free maintenance and monitoring throughout the term of the contract, so it is wise to evaluate this when selecting inverters.
Microinverters have a longer life. EnergySage said they can often last 25 years – nearly as long as their panel counterparts. Usually, these inverters have a 20 to 25-year standard warranty included. It should be noted that while microinverters have a long warranty, they are still a relatively new technology from the past ten years or so, and it remains to be seen if the equipment will fulfill its 20+ year promise.
The same goes for DC optimizers, which are typically paired with a centralized string inverter. These components last for 20 to 25 years and have a warranty to match that time period.
A study by kWh Analytics showed that 80% of solar array failures occur at the inverter level. There are numerous causes of this.
According to Fallon Solutions, one cause is grid faults. High or low voltage due to grid fault can cause the inverter to stop working, and circuit breakers or fuses can be activated to protect the inverter from high-voltage failure.
Sometimes failure can occur at the MLPE level, where the components of power optimizers are exposed to higher temperatures on the roof. If reduced production is being experienced, it could be a fault in the MLPE.
Installation must be done properly as well. As a rule of thumb, Fallon recommended that the solar panel capacity should be up to 133% of the inverter capacity. If the panels are not properly matched to a right-size inverter, they will not perform efficiently.
Maintenance matters
To keep an inverter running more efficiently for a longer period, Those Solar Guys recommend choosing a cool, dry place with lots of circulating fresh air. It also suggested avoiding installing in areas with direct sunlight, though specific brands of outdoor inverters are designed to withstand more sunlight than others. And, in multi-inverter installations, it is important to be sure there is proper clearance between each inverter, so that there isn’t heat transfer between inverters.
Those Solar Guys said it is best practice to inspect the outside of the inverter (if it is accessible) quarterly, making sure there are no physical signs of damage, and all vents and cooling fins are free from dirt and dust.
It is also recommended to schedule an inspection through a licensed solar installer every five years. These standups typically cost $200 to $300, though some solar contracts have free maintenance and monitoring for 20 to 25 years. During the checkup, the inspector should check inside the inverter for signs of corrosion, damage, or pests.
In the next installment of the series, pv magazine will examine the life of residential battery energy storage applications.

Called Stella Vita, the vehicle will now be tested in a journey from Eindhoven to Tarifa in southern Spain and, according to one of the team members, researcher Kevin Smolenaars, it has a range of 600km at night and of 730km on a sunny day, at a moderate speed of up to 85kph.
“The vehicle is designed in a way that the roof slides up when stationary and more solar panels fold out, doubling the PV system surface to 17.5 square meters,” he told pv magazine. “When folded, the vehicle size is 7.20×2.05×1.83m, and when it is unfolded, it reaches 7.20×4.40×2.54m.”

The mobile house has a weight of only 1,700kg and consists of a steel roll-cage and an aeroshell made of glass fiber with an aluminum/foam core. The PV system has a capacity of 4.5 kW and is made with 36 solar modules. The array occupies a surface of 8.8m2 when the solar panels are folded and 17.5m2 when unfolded.
The PV system is divided into eight units, with four units being deployed on the normal roof and four being placed on the additional surface when the array is completely unfolded. All the modules are equipped with maximum power point trackers (MPPTs). “As our vehicle does not drive on the 230 V you see in normal homes, but on 400 V, [standard] MPPTs were not available for our application,” Smolenaars stated. “This meant that we needed to innovate in this area as well, and develop these ourselves.”
The monocrystalline solar cell technology was provided by Dutch manufacturer Mito Solar. “The panels have an efficiency of 23.7%,” Smolenaars specified. According to him, unlike solar panels for rooftop applications, these panels are very lightweight, with a mass of only 1.5kg/m2 “But we can't provide too many details at the moment,” he added.
The modules, which are slightly flexible to adjust to the curved roof shape, were deployed on the vehicle during its construction. “Our PV system charges roughly a quarter of our range on a sunny day and, when stationary, we can charge a bit more than 200km a day, when folded out,” Smolenaars further explained. “This means we can fully charge our battery in about three days, which is perfect for our vehicle and application.” The total capacity of the lithium-ion batteries used is 60 kWh.

The vehicle can host two people and its interior consists of a bed and a kitchen, including a modular cooker you can use outside. Furthermore, there are Philips Hue lights and a smart home system, to create a domestic setting. There also is a toilet and a circular shower which reuses water when taking a shower. “Lastly, we also developed an infotainment system, which gives insight into your energy consumption,” Smolenaars emphasized. “With the infotainment system, you can make decisions about what to do with your energy, like watching a Netflix series on your tablet or driving that extra 10km the next day.”
The research group student team is not targeting the commercialization of the vehicle in future. “We aim at making developers aware of all the innovations we achieved in this project,” Smolenaars stated.
This project was made possible by the partners of Solar Team Eindhoven, which was this year enriched by Coolblue, a Dutch e-commerce company that recently launched Coolblue Energy and provided energy-efficient devices for the interior. “Their mission aligns perfectly with the mission of Solar Team Eindhoven,” Smolenaars concluded. “Furthermore, the Eindhoven University of Technology was a large contributor and helped the team with a lot of knowledge and support on every level.”

The Biden administration has big plans for fighting climate change in the United States, including aggressive infrastructure aims. Solar will play a big part in the new agenda, and participants along the value chain are optimistic.
Developers are gearing up. Residential and small commercial installers are confident. In California, mandates for solar on new residential buildings – and soon for solar+storage on new commercial and multi-dwelling residential buildings – offer a template for accelerating the move away from conventional energy. The chart below provides a view of U.S. solar deployment through 2023, but the real potential is much higher. The United States could be a 50 GW-plus annual
market for solar deployment.
In 2020, 91% of U.S. installations were in the grid-connected commercial segment, which includes utility-scale installations. The top-right chart on the next page presents U.S. demand and installations for 2020. Purchases of modules define demand.

Import country
The United States has more than 20 GWp of annual demand, 2 GWp of thin-film cell capacity, and an additional 5 GWp of module assembly capacity for imported crystalline-silicon (c-Si) cells. In other words, the country does not have the capacity to serve its market. The U.S. solar market is fragile without sufficient domestic cell manufacturing, and participants have little control over module supply and price. A shock to the supply chain would likely stall market growth, at least temporarily, potentially taking that 50 GWp-plus of potential down to the low teens.
The bottom-left chart on this page presents U.S. shipments of domestically manufactured cells from 2010 through 2020. Again, close to 100% of U.S. domestic shipments are First Solar’s CdTe technology.
System shocks
In late 2020, accidents in several polysilicon facilities in China took significant amounts of capacity offline. And repairs were delayed due to the pandemic. Add to that the Chinese government’s control of glass supply, despite bifacial module demand acceleration, and prices rose.
Continuing into 2021, shipping costs increased, and a semiconductor shortage affected inverter and tracker manufacturers that were also experiencing rising costs, after years of absorbing margins and passing higher costs to customers. Developers, accustomed to years of price declines, initially tried to wait it out.
Meanwhile, the situation in the Uyghur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang, China, caught the attention of politicians. In anticipation of action from the United States and other countries, China’s central government passed a law on June 10 forbidding Chinese companies from participating in audits of their materials.
Then, on June 24, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ordered U.S. Customs and Border Protection to issue a withhold release order (WRO) to detain metallurgical silicon produced by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co., Ltd., and its subsidiaries for the use of forced labor in its manufacturing facilities. Hoshine Silicon is the largest metallurgical silicon supplier globally. Its customers are polysilicon producers such as Germany-based Wacker, South Korea-based OCI, Daqo, GCL, Jiangsu Zhongneng, Asia Silicon, Xinjiang GCL, Xinte, and East Hope.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection has begun holding cells and modules at the border, delaying projects, and increasing costs and anxiety for solar developers and installers.
Ethical dilemma
The United States faces a moral and ethical dilemma. On one hand, after years of discussions and delayed action on climate change, governments must act decisively and quickly. On the other hand, forced labor cannot be ignored.
The English philosopher Philippa Foot developed the “trolley problem” in 1967. An out-of-control trolley car is barreling down the tracks toward five trapped people. There is no way to stop the trolley, but if you throw a switch, the trolley will instead barrel down a track where only one person is trapped. So, the choice is five or one.

There is no bargaining with climate change. Unaddressed, it will keep barreling down the tracks. But nor is there any compromising with forced labor or other troubling measures. Nor is there any denying that forced labor may have played a part in the low cell, module, and system prices that the PV industry has enjoyed for many years.
The political timing is right for U.S. solar industry growth to accelerate beyond anyone’s forecast. Behavior has changed, and there is pull from end users. Solar has moved into the political arena, with proponents on the left and the right.
Unfortunately, as indicated, the United States does not have sufficient cell manufacturing to meet its demand, and it will take years to build it. There is sufficient supply unrelated to forced labor in Xinjiang for the United States, but it will be more expensive, and there will be periods of scarcity. Growth will come at a higher cost – but not a higher moral cost. Because, again, there is no compromising with forced labor.
