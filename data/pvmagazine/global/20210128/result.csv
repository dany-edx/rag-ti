Despite a strong need for more power generation capacity, the country's electricity mix is still dominated by thermal power plants, and new plants from renewable energy sources are coming online at a very slow pace. Solar, for example, reached a cumulative PV capacity of only 181.2 MW at the end of September, according to the report Indonesia Energy Transition Outlook 2021, published by the Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR).
This installed power comes from 30.4 MW of rooftop PV, 61 MW of ground-mounted PV plants and 82 MW of off-grid solar power generators. The newly installed solar capacity for the first nine months of 2020 was 28.8 MW, of which 15 MW was for two utility scale projects linked to PPAs signed in 2017, and 13.7 MW for rooftop installations. For comparison, the country added around 46.2 MW of PV systems in 2019 and only 14 MW in 2018.
The authors of the report stressed that solar is currently the second fastest growing renewable energy source in the country, after hydropower, and that, however, it is lagging far behind the intermediate 800 MW target established by the National Energy General Plan (RUEN) for PV technology by 2020.
The RUEN has also set another 6.5 GW intermediate target for solar by 2025. The IESR experts believe the first of the two targets may be eventually achieved if a series of projects and initiatives announced by the Indonesian authorities begin to take shape and materialize.
According to the report, a big contribution for making the ambitious target achievable may come from a series of solar projects that the Indonesian government is hoping to build at two depleted mining sites – the Bangka Belitung islands, off the southeastern coast of Sumatra, where facilities totaling 1.25 GW are being considered and the West Kutai regency, in the Indonesian province of East Kalimantan, where 1 GW of projects may potentially be developed. “Nothing concrete has been done for now but the plan has been mentioned several times by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM),” Marlistya Citraningrum, the program manager for sustainable energy access at the IESR, told pv magazine.
Furthermore, according to her, Indonesian utility PT PLN (Persero) has also recently revealed it conducted several studies for deploying PV at mining sites in Kalimantan and Sumatra, and state-owned mining company PT Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam Tbk (Bukit Asam) has also expressed interest in building solar facilities across several mining sites.
Moreover, the Indonesian government is targeting to install around 857 MW across Java and Sumatra, where several potential sites have already been identified. “In March 2020, [PT] PLN invited pre-selected developers to bid in two separate 50 MW solar projects in Central Java and West Java,” the report notes. “However, according to a source involved in the process, both tenders were postponed until further notice by [PT] PLN due to the [Covid-19] pandemic. There are no other ground-mounted solar project bidding [exercises] this year.”
Despite the lower than expected development, the utility scale segment is already showing interesting prices, including the $0.0581/kWh tariff agreed in a PPA for the 145 MW floating PV plant under construction on a 225ha section of the Cirata Reservoir in West Java. Furthermore, local utility PT Indonesia Power has tendered, last year, two floating PV projects with capacities of 60 MW and 90 MW, respectively, and final prices came in at $0.0374/kWh and $0.0368/kWh, respectively. More details on the two procurement exercises were not disclosed by the report.
Furthermore, the IESR analysts expect more growth will come for rooftop PV from the $1 billion Surya Nusantara program which is expected to be kicked off this year, and from the SOEs Synergy initiative, which is another scheme for rooftop PV currently under development aimed at supporting commercial and industrial projects and to reach 1.4 GW of installed capacity by 2025. According to recent statistics from the government, the country currently has 18.2 MW of PV systems under net metering, with 7.7 MW of the total coming from 16 industrial power consumers. Another 5.1 MW comes from residential consumers while 1.8 MW is run by small-sized businesses. The remaining capacity is owned by public entities.

The EIB will provide a €38.5 million long-term loan towards the cost of a €70.5 million project to expand the generation capacity of the first solar plant installed by Burkina Faso's national electric utility, from its current 37 MW to 50 MW. The solar farm was built by Société Nationale d'électricité du Burkina Faso (Sonabel).
Burkina Faso depends in part on power imports from southwestern neighbor Côte d'Ivoire.
The EIB also announced the signing of a memorandum to work more closely with Croatia's Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development on matters including clean energy generation and transmission infrastructure, green mobility and moving to a circular economy.
The latest developments come after the EU lender on Monday said it had signed a €100 million R&D finance agreement with Spanish electric company Iberdrola which will help drive innovation related to solar power plants, e-mobility and green hydrogen.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/28/winners-prices-of-spains-latest-renewables-auction/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,SPAIN",ALEJANDRO DIEGO ROSELL,"JANUARY 28, 2021","Winners, prices of Spain’s latest renewables auction","From pv magazine Spain
As pv magazine reported earlier this week, the Spanish Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (Miteco) allocated a total of 3.034 GW of clean-energy capacity on Tuesday at an average price of €24.47 ($29.62)/MWh, under its latest renewable energy auction. The capacity allocations included 2.036 GW of solar PV and 998 MW of wind energy.
A total of 84 participants submitted offers for 9.7 GW of capacity, which was more than three times the amount allocated in the procurement exercise. Only 32 companies were successful.
There were high expectations for the auction, as many expected it to deliver prices such as those seen in Portugal last summer. José Donoso, general director of the Spanish solar energy association (UNEF), said that the new auction model has worked very well.
“There has been a very important reduction in the average auction price of 28% over the average price of the electricity market in 2020, and over that of 2021, 62%,” he told pv magazine.
José María González Moya, the CEO of the Spanish renewable energy association (APPA), also praised the auction. “At an international level, the average price does not attract much attention, but we think it is a very reasonable and positive price for the sector,” he said. 
Both González Moya and Donoso agreed that the auction will have an impact on final prices over the long run.
“The results of the auction are good news for consumers and to help the massive development of renewables,” said Antonio Delgado Rigal, CEO of Aleasoft Energy Forecasting. He hailed the results of the auction as “very positive for the sector,” and added that “they coincide with what we expected.”
Javier Asensio, the managing director of Falck Renewables in Spain, said he was satisfied with the results. “It has become clear that wind power continues to have higher remuneration expectations the solar. Or in other words, it is clear that solar is cheaper and will surely continue to lower costs faster than wind power.”
However, Fundación Renovables was more critical. It argued that the auction “delved further into the gap between large and small agents.”
PPA market
Spain was the largest PPA market in Europe and will continue to be in 2021, with an average price of €35/MWh for solar PV, according to the Swiss consultancy Pexapark.
Although there is consensus over expected prices, not everyone who spoke to pv magazine agrees on whether the auction will have an impact on the PPA market.
“It will have a great impact on the sector … PPAs will not be affected in general, but offtakers will look for lower prices,” said Delgado Rigal, adding that long-term price forecasts, if done well, will not be affected by the latest auction. “An auction is like a PPA or a bilateral contract where the off-taker is the state. If the off-taker has a high credit rating, it will be able to aspire to a lower PPA price, otherwise, he will have to settle for a higher PPA price.”
Donoso believes that the PPA market and the auction market are different.
“Here there are companies that seek certainty (auctions) and others that do not mind taking more risk going to the market or building plants based on PPAs,” he said. “We are prudent when analyzing the influence of the auction on the PPA prices.”
Asensio said that auctions are just one more instrument in a broad renewable energy market. He added that there are a number of factors that affect the electricity market.
“There is a lot of life outside of auctions and the important thing is that market regulation is clear, although I think that much progress has been made in this regard in recent months,” he said. “However, in the medium and long term, when the volume of plants with low remuneration grows, it may affect global electricity market prices, and therefore corporate PPAs and all derivatives.”
González Moya, meanwhile, said that “in some way, this is going to give a signal or index to PPA buyers.”
Future auctions
Despite the auction's positive outcome, future auctions could still be improved, some of the industry sources said. In particular, future auctions could include more smaller PV projects.
González Moya also said that for medium-sized companies, it is very difficult to compete under the current auction design: “We are asking that specific quotas are established by size for small companies.”
Fundación Renovables echoed his sentiments.  
“The non-incorporation of quotas for distributed generation has caused the 3,043 MW to be concentrated in only 32 winners,” it said. 
 
Donoso said UNEF also expects that in upcoming auctions, “20% will be earmarked for projects of less than 10 MW … and there will be a specific auction for storage.” Falck Renewables said that it believes that “the small ones will have to make an additional effort in managing the sale of power, with complex instruments and creativity.”
González Moya said that he believes that storage and hydrogen should be included in the next auctions. “I would be in favor of making an even greater effort to encourage the consumption of renewable energy to the detriment of polluting energies, which would involve the whole of society and create a demand for green generation that would ensure the objectives of the energy transition,” said Asensio.
Donoso, meanwhile, demanded more realistic auctions. “That the time coincides with the maturation period which, instead of 12 years, we would ask for 15 years,” he said. “Also, as we have indicated, we would ask for an auction for small plants and storage.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/28/mini-perovskite-solar-module-with-14-55-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 28, 2021",Mini perovskite solar module with 14.55% efficiency,"A research group from the Okinawa Institute of Technology (OIST) in Japan has developed a mini perovskite solar module based on large‐area uniform and dense perovskite films with a thickness of more than one‐micrometer.
The scientists fabricated two modules, sized 5x5cm2 and 10x10cm2, with efficiencies of 14.55% and 10.25%, respectively, which are claimed to rely on perovskite layers with high crystallinity, large grain sizes, and small surface roughness.
According to the scientists, the first device was able to work for 1,600 hours at more than 80% of this efficiency while the larger module was able to maintain unspecified high levels of efficiency for over 1,100 hours.
“Scaling up is challenging because as the modules increase in size, it’s harder to produce a uniform layer of perovskite and these defects become more pronounced,” said researcher Guoqing Tong. “We wanted to find a way of fabricating large modules that addressed these problems.”
In larger perovskite modules, perovskite films are often developed with more defects and pinholes and this issue can be solved only by increasing the film thickness. This was achieved by dissolving a high concentration of lead iodine – which is one of the precursor materials generally used in perovskite cells to improve their efficiency and stability – in the formation of the perovskite film.
Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), which is a white crystalline salt that is highly soluble in water, was added to the solution in order to increase the solubility of lead iodine. “This also allowed lead iodine to be more evenly dissolved in the organic solvent, resulting in a more uniform perovskite film with much larger grains and fewer defects,” the Japanese academics explained. “Ammonia was later removed from the perovskite solution, lowering the level of impurities within the perovskite film.”
Ammonium chloride was applied through a two‐step coating process that is said to effectively retard the crystallization rate of perovskite, leading to uniform and compact, full‐coverage perovskite layers across large areas. The academics are now planning to build a 15x15cm2 module and to test vapor-based methods in the manufacturing process.
The two mini panels are described in the paper Scalable Fabrication of >90 cm2 Perovskite Solar Modules with >1000 h Operational Stability Based on the Intermediate Phase Strategy, published in Advanced Energy Materials.
In previous research conducted by OIST, scanning tunneling microscopy was used to observe the nature of structural defects in a perovskite solar cell material. Many different approaches to this problem have been suggested, including ‘healing’ defects through carefully managed exposure to heat and light, using a potassium solution to limit the ion movement caused by such defects, and inserting extra layers into the cell.

The impact statement about the effects of updating the Trans-European Energy Networks (TEN-E) regulation, dated Friday, also spells out a desire to remove all natural gas projects from consideration for public funding as projects of common interest (PCIs). PCIs are deemed to be of benefit to more than one EU member state and vital to connecting up the trans-EU energy network.
The text, published on the EUR-Lex European Union law website, stated: “Continued PCI status for new natural gas infrastructure is not compatible with the long-term decarbonization objectives [of the EU].”
The document, which will be put before the EU Council of Ministers and European Parliament, indicates the commission decided, following consultation, not to exempt well-advanced natural gas projects from the PCI ban; nor to consider natural gas infrastructure which could also transport low-carbon gases, for PCI status, given the risk such pipelines could end up carrying the fossil fuel anyway.
The TEN-E update proposes removing oil and natural gas pipelines from the list of PCI-eligible projects; updating the definition of smart grids, to ease their attainment of PCI designation; and to include electrochemical energy storage projects, such as grid scale batteries, and chemical storage – hydrogen – on the list of eligible projects alongside mechanical storage facilities, such as large hydro and compressed air systems.
The proposed legislative update will also add hydrogen, power-to-gas and smart gas grids to the list of facilities eligible for PCI status.
The commission wants to double the number of smart electricity grid PCI projects by 2026 and have at least 10 offshore renewables networks and five green hydrogen facilities encompassed by the regime in the same period, as it aims to bring the TEN-E legislation in line with the EU's climate change ambition of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 55% by 2030 en route to full decarbonization by mid century.
The update also proposes a more centralized, regional approach to planning offshore grids; more EU oversight of energy infrastructure planning, to remove the silo approach taken separately for electricity and gas networks; and to speed up permitting processes for PCI projects.

“Here is the ultimate proof that photovoltaic power can – without any subsidies – be competitive to conventional energies, even in a European country further north which still generates 80% of its electricity from coal,” said global director of solar projects Ortmann, in a press release issued by the Bavarian clean energy developer this morning to announce the PPA.
Under the terms of the contract, Baywa will supply solar electricity from its planned Witnica plant, near the German border, for a decade to the Górażdże Cement subsidiary of German company Heidelbergcement.
The 64.6 MWp Witnica solar park is set to come online between Poznań and Berlin by July when, Baywa said, it would be the largest in Poland.
The German renewables developer said it is aiming to install more than 1 GW of solar and wind power generation capacity in Poland over the next five years.
Andrea Grotzke, global director of energy solutions at Baywa re added: “We are pleased to see that not only in Poland but all around the world, companies are sourcing their own green electricity via corporate PPAs. As a unique model for Poland, this PPA serves as an economic structure for a fixed-price hedge against rising electricity costs. Securing energy from solar not only reduces a company’s CO2 footprint. We are convinced that it also results in significant savings on the corporate energy bill.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/28/global-actions-delivering-electricity-for-rural-households-through-off-grid-renewable-energy/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA",,"JANUARY 28, 2021",Global actions delivering electricity for rural households through off-grid renewable energy,"The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 548 million people in SSA currently have no access to electricity in their homes. Over the last two decades, the rate of rural electrification has been rapid due to grid extension programs in Asia, Latin America, and parts of Africa.
Yet in many regions, geographic variables and low rural population density make grid extension too costly a method to provide electricity access for every household. In order to fill the gaps, governments and development organizations have used off-grid solutions to provide rural households and villages with access to electricity.
One of the ways in which rural electricity access has been addressed through off-grid renewable energy solutions is through a market-based approach, which centers on the role of social enterprises (SEs). Such SEs have concentrated their efforts in rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and South Asia where poverty rates are high and grid connection is unlikely in the medium or long term.
There are numerous SEs whose objective is to provide poor rural households access to affordable solar home systems (SHSs) and pico-solar lights for lighting and charging cell phones. These include SunnyMoney, Ilumexico, Azur, as well as many others. SEs’ efforts have been notably helpful in SSA, wherein 2018, it is estimated that 25 million people receive household electricity access through SHSs and pico-solar lights purchased from SEs.
A 2017 report by Acumen Solutions examined the major challenges preventing the scaling of this method in SSA, finding that up-front costs, lack of availability in terms of finance and selection, as well as lack of knowledge of the product have prevented more rural households from purchasing SHSs or pico-solar lights. The report also identified and evaluated various strategies used by SEs to alleviate these barriers.
In order to alleviate the barrier of up-front costs, SEs have offered different payment plans, such as rent to own (households make periodic payments that eventually lead to ownership), perpetual leasing (households pay for electricity consumption but never own the product), and mobile money payment systems.
SEs have also utilized other strategies to increase access and publicize their products for furthering adoption. For example, in Senegal, SunneyMoney has utilized a “Lighting Library” model, which allows students in rural schools to rent pico-solar lights and small SHSs for cellphone charging. Through this model, SunneyMoney found that 35% of families in the targeted schools eventually purchased a product, compared to only 12% in other schools where this was not offered.
This approach has helped disseminate increased knowledge regarding off-grid renewable energy solutions in poor-rural areas of Senegal. However, it may be difficult to replicate this intervention, as it required a high amount of initial investment, indicating that outside financial support may be needed for scalability.
Despite the innovative approaches offered by SEs, there is a lack of evidence that they alone can provide rural households with access to electricity through renewable energy home systems. For example, the report by Acumen Solutions found that many households were still unable to purchase SHSs, even after the introduction of payment plans, because they could not afford the required down payment and suppliers were sometimes not located in their area.
As noted in the 2018 Poor People’s Energy Outlook, the social enterprise approach serves the easiest to reach first, resulting in renewable energy home systems not being available in some locations. Moreover, expanding household electricity access past tier 1 is difficult through such an approach, as higher capacity systems require batteries which make them unaffordable to the rural poor.
Thus, while the approach can deliver basic household electricity needs, the full productive capacity of a household may not be achieved. In 2019, Project Rise conducted a survey on rural households lacking electricity in Zambia and Uganda. It found that 40-50% of respondents indicated that they would like to use electricity for cooling, cooking, and “productive uses”.
Unfortunately, the types of SHSs offered through SEs in both countries cannot deliver the electrical capacity required for these activities. Various development programs have attempted to remedy this problem through end-user subsidies, not only to increase the number of households that can afford renewable energy home systems, but also to allow poorer households to purchase higher capacity renewable energy home systems.
In addition, some programs have also included subsidies for suppliers who operate in targeted remote areas so that underserved areas are addressed. One program that incorporated both aspects was the Renewable Energy for Rural Access Project in Mongolia (2006-12) – a program funded by the World Bank, Global Environment Facility, and the Mongolian government to increase the country’s rate of rural electrification through off-grid renewable energy solutions.
At the time, only 40% of Mongolia’s rural households had access to electricity. One of the program’s objectives was to increase that number to at least 50% by offering end-user subsidies to rural households who purchase high-end SHSs and wind turbine systems.
The program also offered subsidies for suppliers who operate in the areas targeted by the program. The program succeeded in expanding electricity access to rural households; 67,224 SHSs were sold and distributed, thereby resulting in a rural electrification rate of more than 50%. Moreover, a survey of those who received SHSs indicated overall satisfaction with the product, as many respondents indicated that it allowed for better lighting, mobile phone charging, and even televisions.
However, once the program ended in 2012, half of the suppliers abandoned their operations due to the subsidies ending. As a result, many households have been unable to repair or replace malfunctioning systems. Thus, while the program demonstrated that targeted subsidies could aid in providing access to electricity to underserved, remote, and impoverished areas, it also demonstrated that such an intervention needs to be prolonged for it to be sustainable.
A similar strategy was implemented from 1999-2018 in South Africa, however only end-user subsidies were implemented. The program resulted in the sale of 150,000 SHSs, while the initial target was 300,000. This was largely due to a lack of suppliers in the targeted areas.
Therefore, if one wants to utilize a market-based approach, providing economic incentives for renewable energy home system suppliers to operate in underserved areas is vital for expanding electricity access to rural households. However, utilizing subsidies to spur rural electrification through off-grid renewable energy requires large public expenditures, which may not be realistic for most low-income countries.
In addition to renewable energy home systems, stakeholders have also utilized renewable energy mini grids to deliver electricity access to rural households and communities. Some view such systems for rural electrification as superior to renewable energy home systems, as they tend to bring greater electrical capacity to each household, thereby allowing for more productive uses to generate income for poor households and communities.
Various stakeholders have utilized different approaches to bring electricity access to rural households and communities through renewable energy mini grid systems.
From 1996-2011, the Nepal government implemented its Nepal Rural Energy Development Programme with funding from both the World Bank and Global Environment Facility. The program targeted poor, remote villages that would not be connected to the grid within the foreseeable future. 80% of costs were covered through the program, while 20% was provided by the villages through in-kind labor to install the mini grid.
The program was widely successful: 454 micro-hydro mini grids were installed, delivering electricity access to over 58,000 households, representing 600,000 people. Once the mini grids were installed, ownership was transferred to an elected council from each village who determined tariff rates so that each household could afford the service.
Each village has been able to utilize the funds collected through tariffs to maintain and repair their mini grid, rendering the scheme financially sustainable. Two NGO’s – Green Empowerment and Guakia Ambiente – have replicated this model to bring electricity access to rural communities in both Malaysia and on the island of Hispaniola, both achieving high degrees of success.
Following the interventions of both Green Empowerment and Guakia Ambiente, villages utilized electricity access for not only lighting and mobile phone charging, but also for income-generating activities. However, other organizations and governments have attempted to replicate these results and have encountered various impediments with the model.
Most frequently, once the renewable energy mini grids were turned over to the communities, the communities failed to collect tariffs on a regular basis, resulting in a lack of funds to repair and maintain the mini grid. This may be due to a lack of understanding on the part of the community, or in some cases community members may not feel comfortable collecting tariffs from neighbors.
Cost is the greatest barrier to the large-scale implementation of fully subsidized, community owned mini grids. For example, the Guakia Ambiente program on Hispaniola Island cost $14 million to extend electricity access to 4,500 households.
As previously mentioned, funding for this approach came from external donors and governments, with communities paying through in-kind labor. Thus, this approach cannot provide electricity access to 789 million people at a reasonable cost. For this reason, various organizations have attempted to mobilize the private sector by incentivizing the construction of commercial renewable energy mini grids for poor-rural communities.
The Smart Power for Rural Development Initiative in India was somewhat successful. Managed by the Rockefeller Foundation, the initiative worked with suppliers in India to construct commercial mini grids for 85 villages. However, it did so by targeting villages that had nearby anchor loads, such as cell towers, in order to ensure adequate electricity demand.
Many poor rural communities and households are not located near anchor-loads. Furthermore, in many instances involving commercial renewable energy mini grids, not all households are able to afford the tariff rates set by the private supplier. Thus, while this type of intervention has had success, it alone cannot bring wide-spread electricity access to most rural villages and households.
Each of the reviewed approaches and interventions have worked to varying degrees and scales. In certain countries and regions, it may be necessary to use different off grid renewable energy interventions to achieve universal electricity access for rural households. For example, in order to reach households that cannot afford the off-grid solutions offered by SEs, it may be worthwhile to provide end-user subsidies as in the case of the Renewable Energy for Rural Access Project in Mongolia.
In addition, if a lack of operating suppliers prevents households in certain regions from acquiring off-grid renewable energy solutions, then economic incentives for suppliers to operate in certain locations may help. Moreover, incentivizing the construction of commercial mini grids may also deliver electricity access to some rural communities and households.
However, for rural communities that do not draw private investors to construct commercial mini grids (due to there being no anchor load), it may be necessary to implement community owned renewable energy mini grids financed by governments, aid organizations, or NGOs.
Lastly, in designing an off-grid renewable energy solution for delivering electricity access, attention should be paid to geography, population density and electricity demand, as these variables will determine what type of renewable energy should be promoted (wind, solar, or hydro), as well as whether mini grids or home systems should be prioritized.
In 2018, the Kenyan government released its Kenya Off-grid Solar Access project. The project has already received $150 million in funding from the World Bank. It seeks to utilize all the above-mentioned strategies to deliver electricity access to 600,000 rural households through off-grid renewable energy by 2023. While there is no available data on the current status of the project, its potential success may serve as an important case study for the future.

The 25 MW array was awarded to the company by Shell. 
“(Sterling and Wilson Solar) commissioned this project on time with more than 300,000 safe man hours during the pandemic by following all the necessary safety protocols and measures set by the local authorities,” the company said.  
Bikesh Ogra, director and global chief executive officer for Sterling and Wilson Solar, noted that the Omani energy market is growing rapidly. 
“Oman is experiencing a rapid rise in domestic energy demand as more urbanized populations are consuming greater amounts of power,” Ogra explained. “The country wants to expand its electricity generation capacities through renewable independent power projects and aims to derive 30% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030.”
Its latest Oman project is located on a 50-hectare site in the Sohar Freezone. It will save 25,000 tons of carbon emissions per year, thus reducing the dependency on natural gas resources and unlocking large-scale solar opportunities for the country. 
Previous project
Last year, Sterling and Wilson Solar became the first Indian company to commission a PV project in Oman. The Amin array, with an installed capacity of 125 MWp, was Oman’s first renewables-based independent power project. It was also purportedly the biggest single-unit solar park in the world to use bifacial modules. The project – commissioned for Amin Renewable Energy – was supported by a Japanese-Omani consortium featuring companies such as Marubeni, Oman Gas, Bahwan Renewable Energy, and Nebras Power.
Sterling and Wilson Solar has a PV portfolio of more than 10.6 GWp (including commissioned and under-construction projects) in a range of different locations. Its portfolio includes a 1,177 MWp solar PV plant in Abu Dhabi, which is the world’s largest single-site solar plant. The company also provides O&M services for an 8 GWp global solar portfolio.

EDF Renewables North America (EDFR) has acquired the remaining interest in EnterSolar, a supplier of distributed-generation solar solutions to commercial and industrial (C&I) customers.
EDFR, which is known as a leading utility-scale developer, previously bought a 50% stake in EnterSolar as part of a strategic partnership in late 2018. Now, as a wholly owned subsidiary of EDFR, EnterSolar will benefit from greater financial stability and broader offerings, including energy storage and smart electric vehicle charging.
EnterSolar has a 15-year track record of providing behind-the-meter solar solutions for a range of U.S. corporate clients, with the company installing 59 MW in 2020. Its corporate customers over the years have included Amazon, Target, PepsiCo, and Facebook.
EDFR said its latest investment in EnterSolar capitalizes on the accelerating growth in the C&I solar market. Whether by installing rooftop PV arrays on site or signing power purchase agreements, corporations around the world continue to embrace solar.

Hydrogen will need nothing short of a groundbreaking invention and a giant windfall of cash to eclipse lithium batteries in the race to become the dominant green transport fuel, according to an expert at the University of Western Australia.
“Right now, hydrogen is not even close,” said Professor Ray Wills, managing director of Future Smart Strategies, told pv magazine Australia.
Markets tend to prefer single-market solutions, Wills said. In other words, monopolies. Think, for example, of Google – despite all the hype around the potential for the democratization of the internet, just a handful of companies are in control. Once a company or technology gains the upper hand, it's difficult to stop its ascent. Market advantage tends to stick.
Which is precisely what Wills believes will happen with lithium batteries, leaving hydrogen in its wake. “Hydrogen as transport fuel is still a long way behind lithium batteries,” he says. 
Today, the global electric vehicle fleet is believed to be more than 10 million. According to EV Volumes, an EV sales world database, sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) rose from 2.26 million units in 2019 to 3.24 million vehicles in 2020.
These numbers are considerably bigger than hydrogen fuel cell vehicle fleets, which are in the tens of thousands. There are simply more EVs being made at present. 
So is it possible for hydrogen to shoot out from behind? Technically yes, Wills says. But it would need a great push – nothing short of a miraculous invention that could double hydrogen’s efficiency would make it real competitor. Does that seem probable? “Not in the next five years,” says Wills. 
Hydrogen could take off if lithium batteries don’t perform, or if prices and battery densities fail to meet consumer needs. But given the rapid progress that batteries have made in the last decade, Wills gives little weight to the scenario.
Another problem is the issue of infrastructure. But as Wills notes, electric charging stations are winning the infrastructure battle. “Could be overturned? Yes, if someone were to pour money at it,” he says.
Government funds are still the driving force behind hydrogen infrastructure installations. EV charging station infrastructure, on the other hand, is already being competitively installed. “It just adds a layer to the advantage,” Wills concludes.
