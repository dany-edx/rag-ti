The aim is to position the United Arab Emirates as a global leader in low-carbon hydrogen production and export. Masdar said it expects the strategic trilateral collaboration to provide the market conditions to attract international investment and co-development. The parties signed the agreement at COP28 in Dubai.
OMV signed a non-binding development agreement with Masdar at COP28 in Dubai to explore green hydrogen production for industrial decarbonization in OMV's refineries. “The non-binding [agreement] forms the basis of a joint agreement to develop an industrial large-scale electrolysis plant, which will be powered by renewable energy,” said Masdar. “The partners will collaborate to develop the project and plan to make a final investment decision in the second half of 2024.”
Verbund Green Hydrogen has partnered with Masdar to explore the development of a green hydrogen plant in central Spain. “Harnessing the abundant renewable resources of Castilla-La Mancha region, the prospective plant will aim to generate green hydrogen to cover industrial demand in Spain and central Europe,” said Masdar. 
SkyNRG has agreed to work with Masdar, Port of Amsterdam, and Zenith Energy Terminals to explore the feasibility of a dedicated liquefied green hydrogen supply chain. “The parties will join their efforts to study a liquefied green hydrogen supply chain, focusing on production by Masdar and export to the port of Amsterdam to provide hydrogen to regional industries, as well as the European hinterland,” said Masdar.
ACWA Power has signed a deal with Indonesia's state-owned electricity provider and PT Pupuk to develop Indonesia's largest green hydrogen facility, the Garuda Hidrogen Hijau (GH2) Project. Set to commence commercial operations in 2026, the project will use 600 MW of solar and wind power, producing 150,000 tonnes of green ammonia annually, with an estimated project cost exceeding $1 billion, said ACWA Power. The bidding process for engineering procurement and construction is scheduled for the first quarter of 2024, with financial close by the end of 2025.
Wood Mackenzie says oil and gas majors currently hold an 8% market share of announced global net low-carbon hydrogen production capacity, emphasizing a push for small-scale project operations before 2030. Despite their current modest share, the analysis suggests the potential for unannounced projects to quickly alter the landscape, with over 750 companies involved in hydrogen plans. Wood Mackenzie foresees an increase in the majors' market share as low-carbon hydrogen reaches a crucial investment inflection point.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/08/ku-leuven-spinoff-plans-mw-scale-production-of-solar-hydrogen-panels/,"HYDROGEN,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BELGIUM",MARIJA MAISCH,"DECEMBER 8, 2023",KU Leuven spinoff plans MW-scale production of solar-hydrogen panels,"After years of fine-tuning its solar-hydrogen panel technology, Solhyd has spun off from KU Leuven in Belgium and is looking to apply its potential in market-oriented, pilot projects and further develop its manufacturing capabilities.
The newly established company has raised seed capital from a group of entrepreneurs active in Flanders, which have committed to injecting up to €6 million into the company over the next few years. The first tranche of €2 million was put on the table on Thursday.
“We have received a lot of interest from investors from all corners of the world,” Jan Rongé, CEO of Solhyd, told pv magazine. “We will now focus on establishing a network of partners, suppliers and system integrators and get ready for megawatt-scale production by 2026.”
The Solhyd technology combines a regular PV panel and a proprietary hydrogen-producing layer which are connected via gas tubes. Electricity produced by the top layer solar panel is used by catalysts to split water molecules extracted directly from the air using a membrane. The system is said to produce 250 liters of hydrogen per day, at a peak efficiency of 15%.
“The average real life efficiency we are targeting is 12% and upwards,” Rongé said.
Solhyd hydrogen panels are compatible with most commercial PV modules, which are directly plugged into the hydrogen-producing system.
“At this point, we prefer to go with mono PERC panels, but we are also very much looking forward to perovskite-silicon tandems, which we expect to be a very important step in our own development,” Rongé said. “However, in the long run, it makes sense to partner up with certain PV suppliers to optimize the technological synergies such as dimensions and operating voltage.”
So far, the technology has been tested in various climates and demonstrated that it can be deployed almost anywhere in the world.
“The determining factors is the sun. The hydrogen output directly depends on the solar input,” Rongé said. “Our panels can store humidity, so if you have a few dry days, that should not be a problem. The system has some resilience in that respect.”
The technology has also been tested in Africa, where it showed even better results than in Belgium.
“A Belgium summer night is drier and shorter than most African nights,” Rongé said. “It is only in the middle of the dessert that our panel would have a problem to work efficiently,” he said. “In northwestern Europe conditions, one module can produce around 6 kg of hydrogen per year, but in more sunny regions you can easily go to 12 kg per year.”
A 1,000 square-meter roof would then produce 2 tons to 4 tons of hydrogen per year. A smaller roof with 20 hydrogen panels would produce 120 kg to  240 kg per year, which is 4 MWh to 8 MWh of hydrogen energy.
Most recently, Solhyd finished a batch of 10 panels to be deployed at a testing project in Belgium.
“There is still a lot of manual work involved and we are learning which steps we need and quality control measures to facilitate and speed up the production process,” Rongé said.
Solhyd's goal is to deliver a plug-and-play solution which will be primarily applied in industries such as the steel and chemical industry to make their operations more sustainable.
“Making hydrogen at your own premises with a modular technology like ours will also be interesting for SMEs,” Rongé said. “They have a really hard time finding affordable hydrogen or finding green hydrogen at all, because transporting hydrogen is quite expensive especially for those who are not located at ports.”
He said they continually assess the safety qualities of the technology internally and with external experts to evaluate potential risks. He noted that Solhyd panels generate hydrogen at a low pressure of 300 mbar to 500 mbar, similar to gas distribution grid pressure.
“We have designed our hydrogen panels to work at a very low pressure bacause it is cost optimal and safer. They contain almost no hydrogen at all or less one gram per panel so that means the risk is very limited,” Ronge said. “The risk only starts when you want to collect and store the hydrogen at a central location.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/08/two-dimensional-supercrystal-produces-hydrogen-from-formic-acid-sunlight/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 8, 2023","Two-dimensional supercrystal produces hydrogen from formic acid, sunlight","Scientists led by Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU Munich) in Germany have developed a photocatalytic hydrogen generation technology based on plasmonic bimetallic two-dimensional supercrystals.
The researchers assembled the plasmonic structures by assembling individual gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs).
“The arrangement of the gold nanoparticles focuses the incident light extremely efficiently and generates strong local electric fields, the so-called hotspots, that form between the gold particles,” said researcher Emiliano Cortés.
In the proposed system configuration, the visible light interacts very strongly with the electrons in the metal and makes them vibrate in a resonant way, so that the electrons collectively move very quickly from one side of the nanoparticle to the other. This creates a kind of mini-magnet, which the experts call a dipole moment.
This is the product of the magnitude of the charge and the distance between the centers of the positive and negative charges. When it materializes, the nanoparticles capture more sunlight and convert it into very high-energy electrons. These help to drive chemical reactions.
The academics tested the performance of the plasmonic bimetallic two-dimensional supercrystals on formic acid decomposition.
“The probe reaction was chosen based on the lower activity of gold versus platinum in this context, and also because it is a carbon-neutral H2 carrier,” they said.
They found that the supercrystals could be used for catalytic purposes.
“The improved performance of platinum under illumination in the experiment suggests that the interaction of the incoming light with the gold array results in energized platinum,” they said. “Indeed, the AuPt supercrystal appears to be the best plasmonic performer when formic acid is used as the H2 carrier.”
The crystals exhibited an H2 generation rate of 139 millimoles per hour per gram of catalyst. According to the research team, this means that the photocatalytic material currently holds the world record for H2 production via formic acid dehydrogenation under visible light illumination and solar irradiance.
The scientists presented the new solution in “Plasmonic Bimetallic Two-Dimensional Supercrystals for H2 Generation,” which was recently published in Nature Catalysis. The team included researchers from Freie Universität Berlin, the University of Hamburg, and the University of Potsdam.
“By combining plasmonic and catalytic metals, we are advancing the development of powerful photocatalysts for industrial applicationes. It is a new way of using sunlight and a way that offers potential for other reactions, such as the conversion of CO2 into usable substances,” said Cortés.

Energetica Industries, an Austrian solar panel maker, has filed for insolvency with the regional court in Klagenfurt, Austria.
The company can no longer meet its current payment obligations, according to a letter from the Alpine Creditors Association (AKV Europe), which is a creditor protection association.
Around 120 creditors and 94 employees will be affected by the insolvency. The liabilities of the company reportedly amount to around €19 million (20.5 million).
Energetica Industries said that despite the successful completion of the restructuring plan by current shareholders, the causes of the insolvency would be clarified in the proceedings. It noted a recent significant decline in prices on the European PV market.
“This led to a ruinous competitive environment that could not have been predicted in this form: the photovoltaic wholesalers’ warehouses are currently overflowing with Chinese-made modules that are being thrown onto the market at dumping prices,” said Energetica Industries.
Energetica Industries has acknowledged that it fell victim to international fraudsters in February 2023. The scammers used stolen identities and stole several thousand solar modules. The damage from the incident runs into the millions, said the company.

In November, the national authorities approved two 100 MW solar projects to be developed in Feni district in southeastern Bangladesh and Mymensingh district, in the north-central part of the country.
China's Xizi Clean Energy Equipment Manufacturing and Bangladeshi clothing makers Cassiopea Fashion and Cassiopea Apparels will build the project in Mymensingh, under a 20-year tariff of $0.10/kWh.
The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) will set up the other solar plant in Sonagazi with an unspecified Chinese investor as a partner. It will also operate under a 20-year tariff of $0.10/kWh.
China's Hangzhou Boiler Company, in collaboration with Max Infrastructure in Bangladesh, secured approval in October for a 180 MW solar project in Jamalpur district. The Bangladesh Power Development Board is set to purchase electricity from the plant at $0.0999/kWh.
The second project to be approved in October is a 130 MW array in Munshiganj district. A joint venture between Energon Renewables (BD) Ltd and PWR Energy Trading LLC will construct the project.
The Bangladeshi authorities have approved several large-scale PV projects in recent months to expand the share of renewables in the country's electricity mix and reach its energy and climate targets. This increase in projects is likely due to new measures that were recently introduced to help domestic independent power producers build and operate new renewable energy plants.
Over the last seven months, the government has approved proposals for more than 1.5 GW of solar installations. Nasrul Hamid, the state minister for the Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources, said that there are currently more than 1.2 GW of projects under construction in Bangladesh.

Dubai-headquartered energy company Planet One Group announced in 2018 that construction had started on the project, titled Planet Solar, and the company had signed a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and Ministry of Energy.
In 2022 California-based energy company Frontier Energy trumpeted it had become the majority owner of Planet Solar, located in four locations – Kenema, Port Loko, Makoth and Kono.
The project is expected to increase the Western African country’s installed electricity capacity by 30%, according to Proparco Deputy Head of Private Equity Africa and Middle East, Tibor Asboth. Proparco said in the press release that Planet Solar will be the first large-scale grid-connected solar Independent Power Producer (IPP) in the country.
Frontier Energy states on its website that generated power will be sold to the government-owned utility, Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority (EDSA).
Sierra Leone had 9 MW of solar installed capacity at the end of last year, which is more than double its recorded capacity from 2021, the International Renewable Energy Agency said.

Solar is the cheapest new-build electricity in many markets, even amid inflation and price rises, said EY, noting that the global weighted average LCOE for solar is now 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel alternative. Large-scale energy storage is also quickly becoming more cost-competitive and sophisticated, it said.
Solar has rapidly fallen in average LCOE globally, from more than $400/MWh in the early 2010s to about $49/MWh in 2022, down 88%. Wind power LCOE has fallen roughly 60% over the same period.
EY forecasts that solar and wind will become the global baseload electricity source. By 2030 the two traditional renewables are expected to represent 38% of the energy mix, and by 2050 solar and wind may supply 62% of the energy mix. China, Europe and the United States will drive a 53% increase in solar and wind generation, producing over 57% of global solar and wind output by 2050, said EY.
“A global solar boom will power more than half of this, but adoption will vary across markets. Solar-generated power will become the biggest source of energy in countries such as the US, and those in Oceania and South Asia, driven by technologies around solar PV modules advancing at rapid pace,” said EY.
However, these landmarks will not be reached without clearing major barriers to progress, EY said. Particularly in the United States, a backlog of grid interconnection applications is causing delays, cancellations, and large incurred costs. EY said that the United States has at least 1,350 GW of wind and solar capacity and 680 GW of storage is waiting to be connected, which is enough to double the country’s electricity supply.
In a survey of more than 70,000 global consumers, EY found that sentiment towards residential solar adoption is strong. About 62% of survey respondents said they have bought or are thinking about buying solar panels, while 50% are considering buying or have already purchased battery storage.

The latest Forum Italia Solare event saw a notable increase in participation, with 500 attendees in person and 380 online, compared to 280 in-person attendees and 320 remote participants at the seventh forum last year.
The Italian PV market is poised to grow by an additional 5 GW this year, driven by robust expansion in the large-scale segment. This new capacity could push Italy's cumulative installed PV capacity beyond 30 GW by the end of this year, bringing Italy's trajectory a step closer to Europe's two fastest-growing markets – Germany and Spain
Although the rooftop segment began to show some signs of growth deceleration this year due to the expiration of the so-called Superbonus, it also offered a new direction, with a significant amount of residential and C&I capacity going online. Italia Solare said there were 5.6 GW of storage systems in operation in Italy by the end of September, including 5.4 GW of residential batteries.
During one of the event's sessions, representatives from all of Italy's political parties appeared to share the same views on the future of solar in Italy, with some slight differences between them. However, most of their statements and positions seemed not to reflect the real needs of the sector.
“The new rules are often published without adequate discussion with the associations,” the president of Italia Solare, Paolo Rocco Viscontini, told pv magazine Italy.
He specifically noted a new draft law on “eligible areas,” which would change the rules for the permitting of large scale renewable energy facilities. “If it comes into force as the current draft would imply, is destined to represent a real brake on the development of photovoltaics,” said Visconti.
Energy communities
The event also included intense discussions about a €5.7 billion ($6.24 billion) scheme for the deployment of energy communities in Italy, which was recently approved by the European Commission.
“In the latest version of the decree, the form of calculation of the incentive has been confirmed. The limitation of the incentive in the case of access to capital contributions has also been confirmed,” said Andrea Brumgnach, vice president of Italia Solare.
According to several experts, Italian utilities will play a role in the development of energy communities. They should assume the risks associated with energy communities and offer standardized solutions, thus leading to a decrease in costs.

The European Commission said if the agreement is formally supported, fossil fuel boiler installation subsidies will also cease by 2025 and publicly owned buildings will need to produce zero on-site emissions by 2028, with every other type of building expected to reach zero on-site emissions by 2030.
Brussels-based heat pump association EHPA – which calls for heat pumps to be the “number one” heating and cooling choice by 2030 – supports the announcement.
“Setting a date for ending fossil fuel heating in Europe’s buildings provides crucial clarity for consumers and charts the path for the heating sector. It makes any investment in heat pump solutions a future-proof choice,” EHPA Secretary General Thomas Nowak said.
“Thousands of jobs” will be created in Europe if the policy is formally adopted by the European Parliament and European Council, he said.
Member States will be responsible for establishing laws to support the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, according to the European Commission.
European Council Commissioner for Climate Action, Wopke Hoekstra, said the technology already exists to heat and cool buildings in an environmentally friendly manner but there needs to be a “stronger business case” to boost aging infrastructure renovations. The directive aims to do this and “mobilize additional finance and boost construction value chains,” he said.
The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive aims to support the European Union’s efforts to decarbonize infrastructure, with buildings responsible for 40% of the region’s energy demands.
The European Commission said the directive also includes a clause about ensuring buildings are solar-ready from 2027 as the technology will become the “norm.”

Dalby Magistrates Court in Queensland has fined an unnamed piling subcontractor for failing its health and safety duty while carrying out piling work at the 162 MW (AC) Columboola Solar Farm,* owned by South Korean-based Hana Financial Investment and located in the Western Downs region.
The aerosol can explosion which caused a metal bar to strike a worker occurred between May 1 and July 16, 2021, according to Queensland court documents.
The subcontracted company pled guilty and reportedly cooperated with the courts, leading to a diminished fine of AUD40,000 ($26,300) and no conviction being recorded. Court documents also note the defendant had “suffered a downturn in work in the time since 2021” and as such had a limited capacity to pay.
In terms of the incident itself, the Queensland government’s Office of Work Health and Safety said: “One of the defendant’s workers was struck by a 4.7-kilogram metal bar while working on a piling rig at the solar farm. The metal bar was propelled into the worker after 12 Dulux galvanized aerosol cans exploded while they were stored inside a toolbox which was positioned on the same piling rig.”
Neither the worker struck by the metal bar nor three other workers nearby were injured by the explosion.
However, the presiding Magistrate found the defendant should have known about the explosion risk from aerosol cans exposed to heat and trained its workers accordingly.
