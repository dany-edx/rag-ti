The solar capacity will be distributed across three PV projects in Tashkent and Samarkand. The storage capacity will be installed in Tashkent, Bukhara and Samarkand.
“The Tashkent projects will include a 400 MW PV plant and 500 MWh BESS, while two 500 MW PV projects each and a 500 MWh BESS will be developed in Samarkand,” the company said in a statement. “Another 500 MWh BESS will be located in Bukhara, and the project will include overhead transmission lines to help dispatch power to the grid.”
ACWA did not reveal any additional details about the projects.
Uzbekistan is currently supporting large-scale PV through a series of auctions. The latest procurement exercise assigned 500 MW of solar projects in the Namangan, Bukhara, and Khorezm regions. Abu Dhabi-based developer Masdar secured the project in the Bukhara region with a bid of $0.03044/kWh. The 250 MW plant will be connected to a 62 MW storage facility.
A consortium led by PowerChina secured the 150 MW project in Uzbekistan’s Namangan region. The group offered a final price of $0.04828/kWh. French developer Voltalia won the project in the Khorezm region with a bid of $0.02888/kWh.
The country aims to deploy 8 GW of solar by 2030. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the country had only installed 104 MW of solar by the end of 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/20/key-takeaways-from-solar-solutions/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 20, 2023",Key takeaways from Solar Solutions,"The Solar Solutions trade show in Amsterdam last week offered the same dynamic landscape of the previous editions, with growth in numbers and quality.
“The event covered a surface of 21.000 m2 and saw the participation of more than 300 exhibitors and 17.258 visitors,” Christian Sparborth, head of marketing and communications for Good! Events & Media, told pv magazine. “The number of visitors increased by 35% compared to the 2022 edition and the m2 climbed by 10%.”
Sparborth said the event organizer sees it as the first regular edition of the show since 2019. “This year we had a bigger section for heating solutions and heat pumps and we saw the offer for storage systems increase,” he said.
The Dutch solar market is currently stabilizing, but at a very high level, claimed Sparborth, noting that it is still twice as large four years ago. “Next year, the heat pump section will grow and will include more district heating technologies,” he said.
The Netherlands could have installed more than 4 GW of new PV capacity in 2022, according to provisional numbers, and this year demand could reach more or less the same level, said Wijnand van Hooff, general director of Dutch solar energy association Holland Solar.
“We have seen some Chinese companies coming back to the event after three years of absence due to the rules for Covid-19,” he said. “And we have also seen a lot of storage and EV charging, which shows the potential for creative grid management solutions.”
He noted how the event is responding to the well-known grid congestion issues of the Dutch grid.
“Grid congestion is an issue but it is not as big as grid operators make us believe,” he told pv magazine. “The technical boundaries haven't been reached yet, so there will be more deployment of large scale PV in the Netherlands in the future. Congestion management is the solution and is mandatory since November. However, it has not been used at all or at a very limited level so far.”
Van Hooff said that the utility-scale market will not come to a halt in the future, despite the current difficulties.
“We will probably see a shift from subsidized projects under the SDE++ program, which will have more complex requirements in the future, towards unsubsidized projects under power purchase agreements (PPAs),” he said.
As for the rooftop segment, which is currently being driven by net metering, Van Hooff said Holland Solar is currently supporting a proposal for a faster phasing out of the scheme, combined with a rebate program for storage systems that was launched in 2021 by Netbeheer Nederland and Energy Storage NL. They said solar capacity has been growing too quickly and that grid bottlenecks are becoming a serious issue, especially for the nation's low-voltage network.
“We believe that net metering should be phased out but gradually, without abrupt changes that could kill the market,” he said. “In the long term, it would be better for the sector. But we have to avoid what happened in Belgium, when net metering was closed when there was no battery availability and that killed two sectors at once.”
Van Hooff also claimed that solar manufacturing could come back to the Netherlands soon. “There is a very concrete plan for a 3 GW solar cell factory in this country under the MCPV consortium comprising nine companies,” he concluded.
Imfred De Jong, sales manager for Switzerland-based Meyer Burger, said the Solar Solutions trade show has provided an opportunity to meet many installers.
“There is increasing demand for solar modules manufactured in Europe,” he said. “We see this coming from both consumers and enterprises.”
However, De Jong acknowledged that awareness of heterojunction tech advantages is still limited to some installers in the Netherlands. “We are mainly targeting the residential segment at this stage,” he said. “But we are also seeing increasing interest in the C&I business for these products.”
Jacques van der Bijl, director of technical marketing for Benelux at SolarEdge, noted the presence of a bigger heat pump section at the show.
“Our products are an ideal solution for combining PV power generation and heat pumps. We are seeing increasing demand for this combination, but net metering remains the biggest obstacle,” he said. “This scheme may probably be phased out but it is still uncertain what will happen and this is also a problem for the battery segment, for which the Netherlands is in a slow ramp-up.”
He added that the company is also hoping for a gradual transition, as an abrupt change could completely halt the market.
Adele Zhao, head of product solutions and marketing (EMEA) for Trina Solar, said the fair had more visitors than in previous years. She said she was surprised to see visitors from other countries, especially from Eastern Europe.
“The Dutch market will continue to grow, especially in the rooftop segment,” she said. “Grid and constraints currently represent serious issues for both subsidized large scale PV under the country's SDE++ scheme and unsubsidized projects under power purchase agreements.”
Linda Huang, sales director for Benelux and UK at Longi, said the company was able to meet all its strategic partners for both Belgium and the Netherlands at the event.
“Last year we shipped to the Benelux around 1 GW of products and for this year we are targeting 1.5 GW,” she said, noting that the biggest issue for these markets is currently the lack of manpower. “We are shipping mostly for the distributed generation market.”
Daniel Hofer, area sales manager for Austrian inverter manufacturer Fronius, said that many professionals attended the show to look for business opportunities.
“We are opening here new sales channels, especially as demand for European brands is growing,” he said. “Data security is also pushing more clients towards our products, with awareness in this regard increasing considerably among consumers. Supply, however, is still a limiting factor, due to supply chain issues.”
Matthijs Van de Water, manager of distribution and channels at Sungrow, said he was also able to meet companies from Spain, Portugal, Croatia and other countries.
“We see increasing demand compared to last year,” he said. “We still don't see big demand for residential batteries in the Netherlands so far, due to the presence of net metering. However, we are seeing strong demand in Belgium, where there is no more a net metering regime.”

It unveiled the new solution at the ISH trade show last week in Frankfurt, Germany.
The Compress 6800i AW heat pump is designed for retrofit installations and new buildings, both for single and multi-family homes. It has a heating capacity of 3.9 kW to 6.7 kW, measures 800 mm x 1,100 mm x 540 mm, and weighs 143 kg.
It has a coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.8, according to the company's data sheet. The air source temperature can range from -22 to 45 C. The heat pump can purportedly produce hot water up to 75 C, and up to 65 C with external air down to -10 C. Its seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) for heating water to 35 C varies between 4.57 and 4.58, while the SCOP for 55 C applications varies from 3.32 to 3.51.
“To save more energy – and heat more sustainably – the air-to-water heat pump can be combined with the Bosch Energy Manager and self-generated solar energy,” said Bosch.
It claims the Compress 6800i AW is the quietest heat pump in its portfolio. The noise level ranges from 51.2 dB(A) to 57.5 dB(A) during the day, and between 43.4 dB(A) to 46.2 dB(A) during the night. “
At a distance of three meters, the sound pressure level is only 28.5 dB(A), which roughly corresponds to the sound of a light breeze,” Bosch said.

They shared their findings in “Reshoring silicon photovoltaics manufacturing contributes to decarbonization and climate change mitigation,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.
If solar panel manufacturing returns to the United States by 2035, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could be reduced by 30%, said the scientists. Energy consumption could also be cut by 13% from 2020, when the United States relied almost entirely on Malaysia (38%), Vietnam (21%), Thailand (17%), South Korea (9%), China (6%), and Singapore (3%) for PV module imports.
The academics performed a comparative and prospective life-cycle assessment (LCA) to clarify the energy and environmental impacts of bringing crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV production to the United States. The LCA includes emissions during upstream module manufacturing, as well as during operations, maintenance, and end-of-life treatment stages.
They conducted a quantitative analysis based on global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative energy demand (CED), by comparing the offshore manufacturing cases from 2010 to 2020 and the reshored manufacturing scenarios from 2020 to 2050.
“The reshored scenario in 2020 is studied to examine the climate impacts of solely bringing manufacturing back to the US by comparing it with the outsourced manufacturing case in 2020,” the scientists explained. “Moreover, reshored scenarios from 2025 to 2050 in five-year increments are forecasted with cleaner power compositions such as wind, solar, geothermal, etc., building up from 21% renewable power contribution in 2020 to 42% in 2050.”
The results show that domestic manufacturing of c-Si PV modules in the United States in 2020 could have reduced GHG emissions by 23% and energy use by 4%.
“The differences in power mixes between countries lead to discrepancies in climate change impacts of silicon manufacturing, which directly results in the gap in GHG emissions between the [scenarios],” the researchers said.
Looking forward to 2050, the increasing share of solar PV in the US electricity mix is expected to further help reduce GHG emissions in domestic solar panel fabrications by 33%, compared to relying on international supplies in 2020.
“By 2050, around half of US electricity will come from solar energy,” said Fengqi You, one of the paper’s co-authors. “Now, we only have about 3%. The US is ramping up. We are going to increase solar capacity from 74 GW in 2022 to a projected 1,600 GW by 2050. That means we will need a lot more panels in the next three decades.”

“The factory will be located in Benevento, in the region of Campania, and will have an annual capacity of 600 MW,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine, noting that the initial investment will reach €50 million ($53.4 million).
The Lithuanian solar module manufacturer said the facility will produce solar panels for applications in agrivoltaics.
“Italy's favorable climate for agriculture provides a suitable environment for agro-installations, a significant advantage compared to Northern Europe, where the window for agro-installation usage is relatively short,” said Solitek. “Operating a manufacturing plant in Southern Europe will also help Solitek avoid fluctuations in production capacity during winter when solar panels in Northern Europe cannot be used.”
The factory is expected to begin manufacturing in the second quarter of 2024. At an unspecified later stage, it will also make 1 GWh of residential battery capacity per year. “Throughout the gradual development of the new manufacturing facility and after its creation, Solitek plans to generate up to 300 jobs, revitalize a low-employment area, and attract further international and local investments.”
The current issue of pv magazine focuses on the solar manufacturing technology enabling the new era of market expansion and high efficiency modules, including interdigitated back contact (IBC) and perovskite tandem solar cells. The magazine charts the latest technical and investment decisions in the high efficiency solar manufacturing segment and the materials and R&D underpinning them. Reports come in from France, Japan, India, Indonesia, Israel, England, the US, and China and we also examine the troubles of the solar-powered car pioneers.
The company currently operates a 180 MW module factory in Lithuania. It recently unveiled a 40-cell solar panel for agrivoltaic applications with power conversion efficiencies of 12.6%. The module can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V. Solitek said it used the panels in a 1.5 MW agrivoltaic rooftop project in Malaysia.
The Italian government is currently supporting agrivoltaics via a €1.1 billion program, as part of its €220 billion, post-pandemic recovery plan.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/20/australia-startup-announces-nanosilicon-tech-that-may-help-build-better-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 20, 2023",Australia startup announces nanosilicon tech that may help build better batteries,"From pv magazine Australia
Kinaltek has announced a “revolutionary” breakthrough in the production of battery grade nanosilicon materials that it believes will allow battery manufacturers to exploit the benefits of silicon anodes to achieve high-density energy storage at a disruptively low cost.
Nanosilicon materials are expected to form a key component of next-generation lithium batteries with Kinaltek Chief Executive Officer Jawad Haidar saying the specific capacity of the anodes in batteries using silicon can be several times higher than those featuring conventional graphite-only anodes. Haidar said until now the cost of nanosilcon has however been prohibitive with prices up to more than AUD 1,400 ($1,000) per kilogram, making the materials uneconomic for use in most common applications.
“The excessive cost is largely due to the complex, environmentally harmful, multi-step processes used in producing nanosilicon, such as chemical vapour deposition, plasma, ball milling,” he said.
Kinaltek said its patented KinSil technology is capable of directly converting common silica powders in a single step to silicon nanoparticles at a fraction of the cost of competing technologies. Haidar said the process is an extension of the company’s technology which reduces metal oxides to metal powders under very mild conditions of atmospheric pressure and temperatures below 500 C.
“KinSil is capable of producing a range of high-value silicon nanoparticles, including silicon nanopowders (Si-NP), silicon nanowires (Si-NW) and silicon-carbon nanocomposites at a production cost between USD 5 per kg and USD 50 per kg depending on which type of nanoparticle you want,” he said.
“As a result, KinSil makes silicon nanoparticles economic for use in any application and indeed, it makes silicon cheaper than graphite both on a mass basis and on kW per kilogram basis.”
Haidar said the technology marks an important milestone on the road to next-generation energy storage solutions with the capacity of lithium batteries inherently limited by their graphite anode, which is capable of storing about 300 milliampere hours mAh per gram of graphite. Kinaltek is aiming to bring enhanced high-performance nanosilicon to market with energy density up to 1,400 mAh per gram.
“The ability of KinSil to produce low-cost silicon nanowires and carbon-coated nanosilicon can be a game changer for lithium batteries,” Haidar said.
“High-performance nanowires and C-Si nanocomposites produced at a fraction of current prices can disrupt the energy storage market.”
Kinaltek said its technology is also capable of recycling silicon from end-of-life solar panels into nanosilicon through a simple primary step adapting the solar silicon for use as precursors for its process. In addition, the company said its KinSil technology has less than 20% of the carbon footprint of conventional multi-step processes and by-product is recyclable.
Haidar said the KinSil technology, developed in the company’s pilot facility at Villawood in Sydney, has been successfully tested on a lab scale at 1 kg level and the company has progressed to working on a pilot plant at ton quantity scale.
The company said the technology has already attracted significant interest from end-users, with the company talking to some of “the biggest manufacturers in the game.”
Despite this interest, Haidar said Kinaltek is currently negotiating a “significant” private investment to scale up the technology to commercial production which would allow the company to manufacture and commercialise its technology through supplying battery grade silicon-carbon composites and other nanosilicon products to the battery sectors.
“With adequate government support and market traction, Kinaltek hopes to keep its base in Australia,” he said.

Germany's TÜV SUD has confirmed the results.
“It is another significant breakthrough after Himalaya module power reached 715 W in January this year,” Huasun said in a statement.
The Chinese heterojunction (HJT) module maker said the panels have an open-circuit voltage of 49.46 V, a short-circuit current of 17.57 A, and a fill factor of 83.29%. They are based on 210 mm HJT solar cells with single-sided micro-crystalline technology, combined with a super multi-busbar (SMBB) design
“During the module production, Himalaya G12-132 series modules are encapsulated with polyisobutylene (PIB) and integrated with light conversion film, which can maximize the modules’ water resistance and air tightness as well as to reduce the damage to the cells caused by ultraviolet radiation and improve its absorption,” the company said. “So, the modules can realize a higher efficient and stabler performance.”
In the second half of 2022, Huasun launched the G12 series of HJT solar modules, with a focus on large, utility-scale projects. The panels had a maximum power output of 700 W and a module efficiency of up to 22.53%. The projects built with Huasun G12 series modules can save on balance-of-system (BOS) costs, while also deliver a lower levelized cost of energy (LCOE), so end users can generate more energy, it said.
Last week, Huasun started manufacturing panels at its HJT solar cell factory in Xuancheng, in China's Anhui province. The new factory will have an annual capacity of 2.4 GW and will exclusively produce bifacial 182 mm HJT cells based on a cell tech with a power conversion efficiency of 25.26%. The results have been confirmed by the Institute for Solar Energy Research, in Hamelin, Germany.

It is based on a top cell made of perovskite and a bottom cell relying on copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS).
“The cell is based on a perovskite top cell that has been optimized for integration with Midsummer’s CIGS cells that are utilized in their commercial suite of BIPV products,” said Midsummer, without revealing any additional technical details. “The research continues with the aim of a two-terminal perovskite-CIGS cell which will render this particular solar cell highly competitive and suitable for mass production.”
The manufacturer said the tandem cell is suitable for its Duo production equipment, which manufactures 56 mm x 156 mm CIGS cells on a flexible stainless steel substrate.
UCLA set an initial efficiency record for such tandem cells in 2018, at 22.4%. This surpassed the 17.8% efficiency achieved in 2016 by a collaboration of European research institutes, which developed a peroskite/CIGS mini-module measuring 3.76cm².
The US researchers designed the bottom cell as having an indium zinc oxide (IZO) transparent conductive oxide film, a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, a perovskite layer, and a layer of methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz) as the hole-transport layer. For the top cell, they used an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a cadmium sulfide (Cds) layer, and a CIGS absorber.
Yang Yang, a UCLA professor of materials science, said at the time that devices with similar designs could reach efficiencies above 30%.
“We feel fortunate to be working with Professor Yang’s group at UCLA which has demonstrated key advances in perovskites,” said Leon Chiu, president of Pioneer Materials, which is a key supplier for compound sputtering targets used in Midsummer’s novel processing for CIGS on stainless steel. “Integrating Midsummer’s production proven CIGS processing with Yang’s Lab tailored perovskite shows a clear path toward expanding the reach of BIPV by improving efficiency and lowering costs.”
Midsummer currently operates a 50 MW manufacturing facility in Bari, southern Italy, and another factory in Sweden. In 2020, it released a 500 W solar panel for large rooftop arrays.

Spanish energy company Iberdrola is using a real dog and a robotic dog to detect faults in one of its ground-mounted PV plants.
The real dog uses its olfactory abilities to detect problems in the electrical network that could lead to power outages. It was trained by technicians from ScottishPower, Iberdrola's subsidiary in the United Kingdom, to find the faults. The company claims it had a 100% success rate in a test conducted in December.
“Not only has it found all the problems that had been prepared, but he has also detected some that he was not expected to find,” Iberdrola said, noting that the dog saves time and eliminates unnecessary work by helping to fix faults as quickly as possible. “The training of the dog is not accidental, since it is part of a pilot project that joins other actions that the company has planned to deal with inclement weather in the country.”
In addition to the services provided by the real dog, Iberdrola is also using a robotic dog at the PV facility. The device has a built-in thermal vision system that generates thermographic reports on the status of the different PV plant components, as it walks between the panel rows following a programmed route. According to the robot developer – US-based Boston Dynamics – the big benefit of the robotic legs is that they are terrain-independent.
Iberdrola says the robotic dog is able to detect and analyze faults in substations.
“The advantages of this small technological assistant are several,” it explained. “On the one hand, it takes high-resolution photos that it compares with images taken previously, which makes it possible to detect changes in the infrastructures that escape the human eye.”
The company added that the robot can collect large amounts of data, which can help it to increase the number of inspections that are carried out every year.
Boston Dynamics sold its first robot dog in 2020 for $74,500. Thus far, it has been used by various industries for a wide range of applications. Initially, the robotic dog was used to inspect the construction of active infrastructure tunnels, according to the US manufacturer.

“This paves the way for the development of eco-friendly perovskite solar cells that are one step closer to the consumer market,” an NTU spokesperson told pv magazine. “The findings unlock new opportunities for developing superior materials for the capping layer, for more efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.”
The capping layer of perovskite cells is usually fabricated using the half precursor (HP) method, where a chemical precursor is deposited on top of the perovskite layer. The precursor reacts with the lead ions present on the perovskite layer and forms a lead-based chemical compound that makes up the capping layer.
To make perovskite solar cells more environmentally friendly, the NTU scientists developed a new method known as the full precursor (FP) solution. They coated perovskites with solutions containing metal halide salts and phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI).
“PEAI contains ammonium, a positively charged ion that contains nitrogen and hydrogen, which is vital for the chemical reaction,” NTU explained in a statement.
The team synthesized a zinc-based compound known as PEA2ZnX4 using the FP method and found that it was the most effective capping material among the other materials tested. They then created a prototype solar cell capped with the zinc-based compound.

“Unlike the HP method, there is no need to draw lead ions up from the underlying perovskite layer to form this protective capping layer when the FP method is used. This paves the way for the use of non-toxic metals in the capping layer,” said the scientists.
The perovskite cell reportedly has a conversion efficiency of 24.1% under lab settings. The prototype demonstrated an average light conversion rate of almost 23% over 103 cells tested. It maintained more than 90% of its ability to convert light into electricity for more than 1,000 hours of operation at full capacity.
The scientists are working on scaling up the method to fabricate full-sized solar cells. They are also in the process of filing a patent with NTUitive, NTU Singapore’s innovation and enterprise company.
They shared their findings in “Expanding the low-dimensional interface engineering toolbox for efficient perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Nature Energy.
*This article was updated on 21/03/2023 with a change of title from “Lead-free perovskite solar cell achieves 24.1% efficiency” to “Paving the way for lead-free perovskite solar cells”. The previous title was inaccurate because although the capping layer is lead-free, the prototype solar cell still uses lead-based perovskites. This information wasn't clear from the materials originally made available to pv magazine. We followed up with the authors after the mistake was pointed out by a reader. Here's a statement from the scientists: “Our method can be used with lead-free perovskites, which opens the possibility of lead-free perovskite solar cells. But for the prototype solar cell that we created in our paper, we still used the lead-based perovskites, and only lead-free materials in its capping layer.”

Sheep grazers, bee pollinators, solar-tracking hardware vendors, and solar project developers were among the diverse stakeholders represented at the inaugural US agrivoltaics conference last week in Chicago.
The choice of location for Solar Farm Summit 2023, the American heartland, was a focal point of the attendees. Recent policy initiatives promoting active agriculture projects below 10 MW in size include sheep and cow grazing and vegetable and fruit production.
The first Solar Farm Summit, which took place March 14 to 15, drew sheep grazers, seed vendors, and community solar project developers. On the first day of the conference, the summit recorded 460 attendees with printed badges.
