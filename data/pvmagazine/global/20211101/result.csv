Part 2: Costs and savings,"From pv magazine USA
Attaching a solar array to a home is a long-term commitment, with many considerations, and one that offers great potential for energy bill savings. A recent addition to the list of options is whether or not to attach a battery energy storage system.
A battery can often add $10,000 or more to the total cost of a residential solar system, said EnergySage. But it comes with a range of benefits that vary depending on the home’s electricity needs and experience with the utility company. So, what are the benefits?
In part two of this two-part series, pv magazine reviews the capabilities of batteries beyond backup power, which was covered in part one, and evaluates costs, benefits, and timing.
Without a battery, a grid-tied home solar array will export any unused power directly to the grid in real-time. With a battery, electricity can be charged and discharged in ways that optimize energy bill savings.
Take demand charges, for instance. Some utilities, including providers in Massachusetts, Arizona, and Illinois, charge an additional fee based on the maximum amount of power required over a single hour, or 15-minute period, in a given month. A battery can be scheduled to discharge power during peak use times so that peak energy demand is smoothed, and demand charges are lower.
Utilities also use a billing design called time-of-use, which, similarly to demand charges, are intended to discourage power use during peak demand periods. For example, a utility may charge a lower rate of $0.15/kWh during off-peak hours, and then increase the rate to $0.32/kWh.
With a battery, the home is able to store energy during off-peak hours, which typically occur during the day when the solar array is producing the most. The battery can then export power to the home during on-peak hours, which are often in the evening as people return from work and run appliances and the array produces less power. Without a battery, homeowners are subject to whatever rate is being charged if the array is not actively producing.
A third benefit is the ability of the battery to provide value in utilities without net metering. Net metering is the process of exporting energy to the power grid in exchange for credits that can be used to offset utility bill costs.
Some utilities offer a one-to-one value, meaning each kWh of power sent out will cover one kWh of utility bill costs. Others have a decreased value for net metering. 
For example, power may be billed by the utility at $0.16/kWh, but the value of exported energy only offers a credit value of $0.08/kWh. Other utilities offer no net metering credit whatsoever, like in Hawaii, where battery attachment rates are much higher than the rest of the United States at 80%. Again, in the net metering scenario, batteries are able to store and provide power, limiting exposure to the value loss in poor net metering climates.
Cost factors
A lithium-ion home battery comes with a sizeable price tag, usually around $10,000. Currently, energy storage that is paired with a residential solar system is eligible for the 26% federal investment tax credit.
Certain states and utilities offer additional incentives for including batteries, and in some cases the value adder can make a dramatic difference. The SMART program in Massachusetts, the Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) of California, and incentive programs in Maryland and Long Island provide up-front cost relief for batteries.
Programs like ConnectedSolutions of New England offer further savings to homeowners who opt-in to a “bring-your-own-battery” program, wherein an incentive is paid to homeowner who agree to allow their batteries to export power to the grid during times of extreme peak demand.
In addition to the ticket-price of the battery, there may be hardware costs associated, as well. Tesla estimates supporting hardware for the battery costs $1,100, and installation will range from $800 to $2,000. Electrical work like a main panel upgrade may drive costs higher, and some installers will require the customer to cover costs like permit fees or retailer/connection charges, said EnergySage.
Retrofit later?
Bloomberg’s New Energy Finance reports lithium-ion battery pack prices have fallen 87% from 2010 to 2019. With global supply chains ramping up lithium production due to increased demand (also driven by electric vehicle adoption) it is possible that further price reductions may occur. But is it worth waiting for a cheaper battery?
The answer depends, but in the past, the cost of installing a battery after-the-fact, or “retrofitting”, is dependent on the inverters on the array, said EnergySage. Most home solar arrays are installed with AC-coupled inverters, which would then need to be re-converted by an additional inverter back to DC for use by the battery. This means a retrofitted battery would come with an additional cost of another inverter, plus installation costs.
A solar system with a battery included at initial install can include just one DC-coupled inverter, which reduces costs, and converts and stores energy more efficiently than AC-coupled solutions.
It should be taken under consideration that some installers do not perform battery retrofits altogether.
Inverter companies are actively working to make retrofits easier. For example, Enphase recently released a microinverter that the company said can be retrofit to any type of home energy storage battery without the need for recoupling.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/01/scaling-up-perovskite-silicon-tandem-solar-cell-performance/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 1, 2021",Scaling up perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell performance,"With perovskite-silicon tandem cells approaching the 30% efficiency mark, there is plenty of interest in bringing this technology into commercial production. Plenty of work has gone into optimizing the perovskite layer itself for long-term performance and large-scale processing; and now scientists are taking a closer look at how the other important processes in silicon cell production could change when deposition of a perovskite layer is added to the process.
A group led by Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) focused on transparent conductive oxide deposition and cell metallization. These two stages in cell manufacturing are among the most in need of optimization, due to growing concerns over the availability of the indium and silver that’s most commonly used.
The research takes processes used in silicon heterojunction (HJT) cell manufacturing as a starting point, and examines how the addition of a perovskite top cell would change the requirements for the rest of the cell structure. Their full results can be found in the paper Optimized front TCO and metal grid electrode for module integrated perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells, published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
For the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer, which is typically made from indium-tin-oxide, the group finds potential for a significant reduction in material usage. The tandem cells operate at a lower current than silicon alone, and the perovskite top layer has a lower refractive index than silicon, meaning the TCO no longer needs to perform an additional role as an anti-reflective coating. Based on this, the group theorizes that the TCO thickness could be reduced from 75 down to 20 nanometers, resulting in a cost reduction of €0.0146 per cell, or €0.0079 per cell where indium tin oxide is partially replaced with aluminum-zinc oxide.
For cell metallization, the group investigated various possibilities for finger width and layout, concluding that the number of wires needed for interconnection could be reduced from 18 to 9 or even less, particularly if a copper plating solution for metallization could be developed. “For a finger metallization with very low-line resistivity, which can be potentially achieved with copper plating, a reduction down to five wires could be possible, given that the contact resistivity of the fingers towards the wires is low enough,” the group explains.
Aside from this possibility, however, the group does not expect tandem cells to bring about a significant reduction in silver consumption. Finally, they note that for both processes the sensitivity of the perovskite means that temperatures in production need to be reduced, from around 220 degrees Celsius used currently in HJT production down to 130 degrees Celsius.
Overall, they find that with optimized TCO and metallization processes, perovskite-silicon tandem cells could reach a levelized cost of electricity of €0.0751/kWh, lower than ISE’s estimate of €0.0849 for today’s single-junction PERC technology.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/01/how-to-clean-pv-systems-covered-by-volcano-ashes/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,SPAIN",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"NOVEMBER 1, 2021",How to clean PV systems covered by volcano ashes,"From pv magazine Spain
At pv magazine, we recently analyzed the effects that the ash from the Dorsal de Cumbre Vieja volcano, in La Palma, on the Canary Islands, could have on a 1 MW solar facility that began operation in 2008. Now we have spoken with Alfredo Manuel Sánchez Ramos, a manager at Multisistemas E2, a Canarian residential and commercial installer.
We have asked him to what extent the volcano is affecting the PV systems located nearby. “We have lost five installations sold in 2010, and others that were commissioned four months ago, and one that was installed just a week before the volcano erupted,” he told pv magazine. “We have withdrawn another three residential systems at the request of the clients.”
Sánchez Ramos also revealed that another 25 arrays, both small and large, were cleaned. “In terms of the fallen ashes, we have quite a few problems each week, as we have to clean both panels and inverters,” he said. 
“The ash from the volcano is very fine earth, like that of the beach of our islands of black sand. It hit the modules from all sides and some of the grains may also have a size that is larger than usual. But, as for now, we haven't identified any breaking in the panels,” Sánchez Ramos emphasized.

We asked if it would make more sense to wait for the volcano eruption to finish or considerably reduce its activity before cleaning the installations. “This is a question for the end customer but we understand the motivation that drives customers to clean now,” he also explained. “Some facilities sell production to the network and we all know that the market price is on the rise. The same reason leads self-consumption, industrial and residential, to want the installation to be operational again as soon as possible.”
The sand creates a thick layer on the modules and Multisistemas E2‘s specialists work with blowers or very fine brushes so as not to damage them. Once the sand is removed, they clean the panels with water but inlet water cannot be used, as doing so would form a very heavy putty that can damage the modules.
Air is used to clean the inverters and their interior parts, especially the filters and electronic circuits. “And we lubricate everything,” added Sánchez Ramos. “Thank goodness we have worked on time and the components have not been damaged for now. But if they were not cleaned, I think the fans and electronic parts and capacitors would suffer a lot.”

The IRI, which gives technical and scientific support to the nation's industry, said: “All shipments of used solar panels or photovoltaic systems dated beyond 20 October 2021 will be considered non-compliant with Decree 6997/2020 and treated accordingly.”
While the IRI is considered an independent non-profit organization, its role as a national consultant and advisor means the Lebanese Ministry of Industry should take its recommendations into consideration.
The IRI claims used solar panels cannot be tracked, or assessed for compliance with the relevant decree’s mandatory national standards, and therefore expose consumers to the risk of fraud.
pv magazine has reported on shipments of panels which should have been sent for recycling from Europe but were instead set to be sold, illegally, in African and Middle Eastern markets.
Lebanon is going though a political and economic crisis which has caused the Lebanese pound to lose more than 90% of its value in the last two years.
As a result, the country’s state-owned utility cannot purchase fuel to generate power and electricity is available for only a few hours per day – and sometimes not at all – even in the capital, Beirut.
Residents have turned to diesel generators and off-grid solar-plus-battery systems and, whilst the electricity crisis has boosted demand for solar panels, that fact appears to apply whether such products are legit or not.
In theory, there is nothing wrong with using second-hand panels and the same can be said about fabricating a module from reworked cells: Defective areas can be cut away and the remaining, good cell fragments can be used. That is a job which has to be done properly, however, and should be accompanied by a process of certifying fabricated modules.
There is also the possibility of fake solar cells being mixed with functioning ones to assemble larger, more expensive panels. Such practices are fraudulent and harm the environment and public safety.
In the European Union, the EU directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment requires the recycling of end-of-life photovoltaic panels but that does not in itself address the question of when a panel should be considered electrical waste and when merely second-hand.
A good start for the authorities in destination markets could be to establish strict legal frameworks to impose penalties on companies importing defective or falsely advertised solar products.

The company said the factory is being built with the support of the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (MISE) and the Italian investment institution Invitalia, which is part of the Italian Ministry of Finance, which provided a €38 million low-interest loan for the project.
Overall, Midsummer expects to invest around €66 million in the new manufacturing facility. Production is expected to start next summer. Around 35% of the investment would be covered by the grants and 23% by the low-interest loans. The funds come from the economic stimulus program of the Italian government to rebuild the economy.
“We will increase our maximum production capacity tenfold and the factory will make Midsummer the largest manufacturer of thin-film solar cells in Europe,” said CEO Sven Lindström. So far the manufacturer, which, in addition to flexible thin-film modules also offers solar roof tiles, has a production facility in Järfälla, Sweden.
The factory will be equipped with the company's own DUO machines.
Midsummer says it has seen a 500% increase in incoming orders in the third quarter. The demand for its PV modules, which are just two millimeters thick and extremely light, at three kilograms per square meter, is claimed to be very strong in the Nordic countries. The products that will be produced in Bari in the future are primarily intended for customers in southern Europe, the manufacturer said.
The factory will be operated by the wholly-owned subsidiary Midsummer Italia.

Germany registered the addition of 406.4 MW of new PV capacity in September, according to the latest figures from federal network agency the Bundesnetzagentur.
This compares to 434.5 MW in August this year, and 388 MW in September 2020.
In the first nine months of 2021, developers connected over 4 GW of solar to the grid, compared to 3.5 GW in the same period a year earlier. The country's cumulative solar capacity topped 56.5 GW at the end of September.
More than 321.6 MW of September's new capacity was attributable to rooftop and ground-mounted systems up to 750 kW in size and built under the FIT scheme.
The Bundesnetzagentur also published new compensation rates which will begin this month. The monthly decrease of solar subsidies remains at 1.4% while fixed feed-in tariffs for rooftop systems will range between €0.0714/kWh and €0.0543/kWh, depending on system size.

The CIS decision was part of a plan to make the company a PV system provider and panel manufacturer on an OEM basis.
The new 250 W mono residential PV panel is called SFB250-88A and has a size of 1,320x977x35mm. Its weight is 14kg and its power conversion efficiency reaches 19.3%. The open-circuit voltage is 30.36 V and the short-circuit current is 10.41 A. This panel can be used with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and with operating temperatures ranging from -40 to 85 degrees Celsius. The power temperature coefficient is -0.35% per degree Celsius.
The company provided a comparison with its largest CIS product – the SFK190-S module with nominal power of 190 W– which measures 1,257x977x35mm and weighs in at 18.5kg. Its higher weight, compared to the new monocrystalline product, depends on the use of the thin-film technology that, despite its lower environmental impact, gives birth to heavier panels. The SFK190-S module has an efficiency of 15.5% and its temperature coefficient is -0.33% per degree Celsius. The maximum operating system voltage is also 1,500 V.
The manufacturer said that the SFB250-88A panel has almost the same compact size as the CIS modules of the SFK series but noted that it offers a 22% higher yield.
The module is available for sale in the Japanese market starting from today. It comes with a 20-year performance guarantee, with an annual degradation rate of 0.7%.

The fourth phase of the government tendered SolarNova plan will involve the installation of solar panels on more than 1,200 public housing blocks and 49 government sites, Sunseap announced this morning.
The developer won the tender in 2019 and began installation last year. Sunseap described the fourth phase of SolarNova as having a total generation capacity of 70 MWp and “potentially, up to 102 MWp.”
Trade tensions, supply chain problems, severe weather and more will be discussed on Tuesday, November 9, at pv magazine‘s virtual Roundtables USA 2021 event. Join us as solar experts discuss the big issues next Tuesday. For more information and to register free for the event, click here.
The developer has already secured a “virtual power purchase agreement” with social media platform Facebook for the latter to purchase the renewable energy credits which will be generated by any SolarNova 4 clean energy which is fed into the Singaporean grid because it is not needed at the generation sites.
The green loan has been secured from two Singaporean lenders, who will supply the credit on a 50/50 basis: the United Overseas Bank Ltd whose controlling shareholder is the Temasek Holdings sovereign wealth fund, and DBS Bank.
With DBS' Joyce Tee, quoted in the Sunseap press release, describing SolarNova 4 as “one of Singapore's most ambitious solar projects to date,” the developer said its rooftop panels would generate almost 97 GWh, enough to power 20,400, four room public housing apartments.
The overall SolarNova program, Sunseap said, is being led by government departments the Housing Development Block (HDB) and the Economic Development Board, with the HDB having committed to install 330 MWp of solar generation capacity on 6,901 housing blocks en route to 540 MWp this decade.
The Singapore government has pledged to achieve peak greenhouse gas emissions this decade, to halve that ceiling figure by 2050, and to have a net zero economy “‘as soon as viable' in the second half of the century,” Sunseap stated.

“We don't distinguish between rooftop, ground-mounted or other types of installations,” the research's main author, Lucas Kruitwagen, told pv magazine. “We filtered our training, cross-validation, test, and predicted dataset for facilities less than this size, although not many facilities of this small size were detected.”
“It's not really a tool, we haven't done any downstream work other than the research to quantify the land-use impact,” the Oxford-based scientist said, describing the inventory, which can be found via several links, including visualization by ResourceWatch and for download on Zenodo. “The generic nature of our data means that many people can use it for different downstream tools and use cases.”

The global corpus of sensing imagery was built using cloud computation infrastructure developed by U.S.-based geospatial data company Descartes Lab. The search area was defined by dilating a global human population-density map and the resulting area measured 72.1 million square kilometers, which corresponds to around 48.4% of the Earth’s land surface area.
“Nominal alternating-current generating capacities of installations are estimated by using simple assumptions about installation tilt angle, ground coverage ratio, inverter loading ratio and panel efficiency,” the academics explained.
Through the inventory, which also includes off-grid installations of more than 10 kW, the researchers were able to identify 68,661 facilities, totaling 423 GW across 31 countries. Of these PV arrays, 18,449 are located in China; 9,906 in Japan; 4,525 in the United States; 2,021 in India; and 17,918 in the European Economic Area. Sampling was made from a global land-cover map.

“We observe that non-residential PV is most commonly installed on croplands, followed by deserts and grasslands,” the research group stated. “Our observed installation dates can be used to generate insight into the gap between facility-level final investment decisions, construction start [dates], construction completion [dates] and facility [operations],” it further explained. “Our land-cover analysis provides insight into global trends for PV siting decisions.”
The global inventory is presented in the paper A global inventory of photovoltaic solar energy generating units, which was recently published in nature. The research team includes scientists from Descartes Labs and the World Resources Institute. “Future work to enhance the dataset should include temporal updates, improved installation geometries, better estimates of installation type, and its combination with residential solar PV datasets,” they emphasized.

In April, the consortium achieved a 28.7% record efficiency for the device, but the new results mark a significant improvement. “This was made possible by further increasing the wide-bandgap of the perovskite cells with high near-infrared transparency,” Gianluca Coletti, TNO's program manager for tandem PV technology, told pv magazine. 
Solliance said the perovskite cell has reached a stabilized efficiency of 17.8% during five-minute, maximum-power-point tracking. “In combination with the Panasonic silicon bottom cell, a new world-record 4T perovskite/Si tandem efficiency of 29.2% is realized,” it said, noting that the efficiency rating refers exclusively to the front side of the cell.
The cell is based on a highly near-infrared transparent perovskite cell built by TNO, EnergyVille, and an 11.4%-efficient c-Si interdigitated back contact (IBC) silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cell developed by Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic.
In a recent paper, the research team explained that the cell was used in 24.5 mW/cm2 bifacial tandem mini-modules with an area of 100 cm2 in combination with a PERC bottom cell. The panels exhibited a 3 mW/cm2 gain compared to the same device with a monofacial architecture. According to the scientists, outdoor results have shown that the module can outperform the monofacial counterpart by more than 25% in a 10% albedo environment.
“The record 4T  tandem device and the scaled up tandem modules can be used for the utility scale and commercial rooftop market segments thanks to the opportunity for bifacial installations,” Coletti said.
The research team combined the transparent perovskite cell with a flexible copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) tandem solar cell built by MiaSolé Hi-Tech, a U.S. unit of Chinese thin-film specialist Hanergy. The efficiency rating was 27.1%, up slightly from 27.0% in April.

The coal-rich region of Gippsland in the Australian state of Victoria is trying to establish itself as a hydrogen center, with fuel cell-focused startup H2X announcing plans last week to produce hydrogen fuel cells, electrolyzers, hydrogen-powered vehicles, and generators with Gippsland Circular Economy Precinct (GCEP).
GCEP is a consortium of Gippsland-based businesses driven by a shared desire to develop an integrated hydrogen economy in the region. With a long history in coal, Gippsland’s high level of engineering, power generation and manufacturing expertise was a major factor in the decision, said Brett Singh, executive director of GCEP. Rapidly growing H2X is expected to help expedite Gippsland's plans.
ASX-listed hydrogen producer Pure Hydrogen recently bought a 24% stake in H2X Global. The deal will see Pure Hydrogen become H2X’s preferred hydrogen supplier, and will usher in a new joint venture company, Pure X Mobility, which will develop and sell hydrogen fuel cell utility vehicles.
H2X plans to unveil a range of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) over the next 24 months, including everything from trucks and buses to light vehicles like the Warrego pickup truck, which the company launched in September. It is also looking to target the agricultural industry and create farm-ready machines, according to the company’s corporate affairs specialist, Tony Blackie.
