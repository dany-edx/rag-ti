The equity investment was led by two new investors, London-based growth investor, Highland Europe, and climate software investor, Energize Ventures, based in Chicago, along with Boston-based Elephant VC, an investor in the company’s first round in 2021.
With capital in place, PVcase has developed the German, Spanish, and UK markets for the geographic information system (GIS) data-enhanced site-selection technology that it recently added to its platform by acquiring Colorado-based Anderson Optimization (AO), according to Trainavicius.
When asked if more acquisitions are planned, or if investments will be made in internal software development, Trainavicius told pv magazine, “Our preference traditionally has been to build and not buy, however, the Anderson Optimization deal made too much sense for our clients to not do it. We are in the process of deciding the best way to expand the platform into a true end-to-end software solution to service the entire lifecycle of solar utility plants. We are also hiring globally, with fifteen open positions.”
In a statement, the new investors mentioned PVcase’s opportunity to reduce the time spent on data-related issues for solar projects. PVcase claims its solutions reduce design time from days or hours to minutes.
“Good, streamlined data across the design and construction lifecycle is the fuel we need to keep the renewable energy transition moving toward a cleaner future. We need to advance solar operations fully into the digital age by reducing data risk. We’re making this investment so PVcase can lead the industry to a solution,” said Irena Goldenberg, Partner at Highland Europe, in a statement.
“The utility-scale solar industry is poised for explosive global growth in the coming years, yet it currently lacks the digital tools needed to meet the demand of the market,” said John Tough, managing partner of Energize Ventures and PVcase board member, said in a statement.

Switzerland-based heterojunction solar panel maker Meyer Burger AG says it intends to set up a 2 GW solar cell factory in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Meyer Burger plans to start manufacturing at the cell factory in the fourth quarter of this year. The solar cells manufactured in the new plant are intended exclusively for the company’s own module production, which is currently being built in Goodyear, in the US state of Arizona.
The modules are intended for sale in the North American market. Meyer Burger originally wanted to supply the module plant in the United States with heterojunction solar cells from Germany.
The investment will benefit from the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credit and related policies, as well as support from the state of Colorado and the city of Colorado Springs.
Meyer Burger expects tax credits of up to €1.4 billion ($1.6 billion) from the IRA alone for the 2024-32 period.

He also shared his predictions for solar’s ongoing growth.
Let’s start with the highlights from GoodWe at Intersolar this year – you have a bigger booth than ever, it seems.
Actually, if you look around our booth, you'll notice that we have a comprehensive portfolio in the market. We are transitioning from being a product supplier to a solution provider. For example, our EcoSmart Home solution, includes inverters, batteries, BIPV for rooftops, as well as our software platform for residential storage integration. On the commercial side, we offer new products such as string and hybrid inverters, BIPV, and we are developing an EMS for overall management of the commercial storage system. In essence, we provide customers with an end-to-end solution.
And you’ve also expanded into utility-scale products over the past year or so…
Yes, we are focused on three main domains: residential, commercial, and utility-scale solutions. The utility side is a new area for us, but we have made significant progress. We offer various big and small inverters, including the GW250K-HT inverter, SCU communication box, and MV station with a monitoring system which provides customers with flexibility to access data and manage the system.
Is there a particular region where you see the most utility-scale progress?
Europe is the region where we have seen significant progress. We have established competency centers globally, such as in India, Brazil, Germany, and Spain, with local experts leading the solutions commercially and technically. We have made breakthroughs in Germany, Italy, Spain, and Ireland, where we have signed deals for large-scale projects. We are also seeing new projects in South America and Southeast Asia.
How do you balance your vision for new products with customer requests?
Balancing our vision and customer requests is crucial. We have a yearly roadmap that aligns with our vision of being a solution provider. We identify missing elements and develop them as the next step, such as the EcoSmart Home solution. We also consider customer feedback and collaborate closely with them to incorporate desired features. We analyze each feature request to determine if it aligns with our goals and gives us a competitive advantage. Our expertise helps us make informed decisions and stay ahead in the market.
The industry faced supply issues during the pandemic. How have you adapted?
The pandemic presented significant challenges for the industry, including component supply and logistics. However, we have learned from these experiences and made improvements. We have established a strategic partnership with a top IGBT supplier, ensuring component security. We have also qualified new suppliers and diversified our component offers through a stringent verification process. This has mitigated risks on the supply side, and we have mostly recovered. Lead times for most components have returned to normal, and we are pursuing operational excellence throughout the supply chain.
What is GoodWe's production capacity and product portfolio split?
We have a production capacity of 30 GW for inverters and 2.1 GWh for batteries. We plan to expand these capacities further but of course we will see how the market goes and our strategy should be in a smart way. In terms of capacity, more than 60% of our demand comes from the C&I and utility sectors, while 30% to 40% is residential and small C&I. We have introduced an automatic production line for inverters, allowing us to be more flexible and adjust to demand. We anticipate significant growth in the C&I and utility sectors, potentially doubling or tripling our baseline.
How is GoodWe's R&D focused on current and new technologies?
R&D is a priority for us as we strive to be a solution provider. We invest around 8% of our revenue each year in R&D, which I believe is more than sufficient.
Our strategy includes investment in both hardware and software to drive product innovation and build our platform. We align our R&D resources with market trends, particularly in the booming C&I segment and storage solutions. We aim to remain innovative and meet the evolving needs of our customers.
In a previous interview with us, you gave us pretty accurate forecasts for the global PV market. Looking into the crystal ball again, what do you foresee for the global PV market in 2023? What capacity will be added?
Overall, I expect the market to continue growing well. While there may be occasional hiccups, the market remains strong. I anticipate 20% to 40% growth in the next two years. If 2022 reached 250 GW, I believe 2023 will be around 300 GW to 320 GW. The driving factors include demand, cost reduction efforts, and advancements in technology that make grid parity more achievable and cost-effective than conventional resources. However, global economic conditions and installer capacity will also play a role in the actual growth rate.

The project uses excess solar power generated by a rooftop PV array to power a small-sized electrolyzer for hydrogen production.
The generated hydrogen is then stored in hydrogen-absorbing alloy tanks, which are generally known for having increased compactness and safety levels.
The hydrogen stored in the tank is then used in fuel cells to produce electricity for the building regardless of the time of day or season, contributing to self-sufficiency in household power consumption.
The company said the hydrogen storage alloys used in the project have higher energy density than battery storage and do not have natural discharge, so they have the advantage of providing large capacity and long-term energy storage.
“In addition, compared to high-pressure gas tanks, it has a very compact design, so you can expect proposals that suit your home,” it said.
The company added that it expects to commercialize the proposed solution from the summer of 2025.

Scientists from LUT University in Finland and the Regensburg University of Applied Sciences in Germany have recently studied whether seasonal hydrogen storage (SHS) can be a cost-effective solution for maximizing solar self-consumption in the coming decades.
The team conducted a global analysis across 145 regions from 2020 until 2050 in five-year increments under a “least-cost” model. They simulated a residential rooftop PV system with SHS using the software LUT-Prosume. The analysis included detailed projections for SHS system component costs obtained from various sources. The SHS components included a water electrolyzer, hydrogen compressor, storage tank, and fuel cell.
In January, a Dutch consortium led by the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) and the social housing organization Woningcorporaties, connected an existing residential building located at TU Delft's campus to an underground hydrogen network that is now meeting all demand for space heating and hot water.
The results show that SHS can only be expected in a niche off-grid market, in regions limited to North America, Northern Europe, and Northwest Eurasia. Lebanon, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar could also see small amounts of SHS capacity, according to the study.
Furthermore, a recent study conducted by scientists from German research center Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH has proposed an optimization model to integrate solar power generation from rooftop PV arrays with hybrid hydrogen storage in a self-sufficient, well insulated, highly energy-efficient residential building.

Subject to a final investment decision, construction of the 1,040 MW/ 2,080 MWh BESS project could kick off in the first quarter of 2024 with it slated to enter commercial operation in the final quarter of 2025.
Carton Power said it is “in advanced talks with companies to finance, build and operate the Trafford BESS.”
The Trafford BESS is the company’s second major energy project that has received council permission for the c12 hectare Trafford Low Carbon Energy Park, eight miles south of Manchester, which formerly hosted a coal-fired power plant.
The other project is Carlton’s 200 MW Trafford Green Hydrogen scheme. Its first phase of 15 MW to 20 MW is set to go into commercial operation in the final quarter of 2025.
“Carlton Power acquired the former coal fired power station in 2008 to redevelop the site for new energy projects,” said Keith Clarke, founder and chief executive of Carlton Power. “With the approval of the BESS, this brings the total investment value of the site to £2 billion, which will deliver significant economic benefits to the Greater Manchester region and help to deliver the regional net zero targets.”
In addition to Carlton Power’s two projects, Highview Power Storage plans to build a 250 MWh long-duration, liquid air energy storage system for GBP 250 million on the Trafford Low Carbon Energy Park. These projects will support the region’s goal of net zero-carbon emissions by 2038.

The project team intends to make the technology commercially available in Stellantis vehicles before the end of this decade.
According to the project partners, this integration of the inverter and charging functions enables a more efficient and less expensive energy storage system, which enhances the range and takes less space in the vehicle.
“The IBIS project offers the opportunity to reduce vehicle weight and the cost of EV powertrain and vehicle manufacturing, while offering a large number of new features,” the partners said.
IBIS integrates electronic conversion cards that perform the electric charger and inverter functions and are installed as close as possible to the lithium-ion battery cells. Its control system makes it possible to feed AC power directly to the battery and enables AC current for the electric motor to be produced directly from the IBIS.
A demonstrator has been in operation since last summer. According to the project partners, this system is “the subject of numerous patents and marks a major break from electrical energy conversion systems currently used.”
The demo project has been a testing field for a variety of technical concepts and control and operating functions in preparation for automotive and stationary applications.
The IBIS project partners are now focused on building a fully functional prototype vehicle, which will be tested on Stellantis development benches and test tracts as well as on open roads.
In the field of stationary energy storage and renewable energy integration, the IBIS technology will enable Saft to offer “turnkey installations with improved battery availability, optimized use of installed energy and a smaller footprint.” The intrinsic architecture of the IBIS battery will allow for simplified maintenance and upgrade, according to the project partners.
The IBIS project is funded by the Future Investment Plan, administered by the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) and coordinated by Stellantis.
Saft, E2CAD and Sherpa Engineering are involved as industrial partners on the project, alongside the CNRS research laboratories GeePs, SATIE, LEPMI, and Institut Lafayette.

Argentina's Ministry of Energy has announced the results of the Renewable Energy Generation Tender RenMDI2 program. It originally planned to allocate 620 MW of generation capacity.
The ministry said it selected 98 projects totaling 633.7 MW in the procurement exercise, with 501.1 MW of PV split into 44 projects. The remaining capacity comes from a 10 MW wind farm, a 3 MW biomass project, 29.9 MW of biogas plants, 39 MW of biomass plants, and 19 small hydroelectric projects (PAH) equaling 37.5 MW.
The solar projects will be distributed throughout the provinces of Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Chaco, Córdoba, Corrientes, Formosa, La Pampa, La Rioja, Mendoza, Misiones, San Juan, Santa Fe and Santiago del Estero.
Winning bids will secure 15-year supply contracts with Cammesa, the company that manages the country’s wholesale electricity market.
The procurement exercise is the nation's first public tender for renewable energy since 2019. In that year, Argentina held the third round of its “RenovAr” public tender, with a minimum price of $54.22/MWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/24/new-grid-forming-inverter-concept-based-on-bee-colony-algorithm/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 24, 2023",New grid forming inverter concept based on bee colony algorithm,"Researchers from Inha University in South Korea have created a new grid-forming inverter concept based on the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, which is an optimization algorithm based on the intelligent behavior of a honey bee swarm.
This algorithm mimics the food-foraging behavior of honey bee colonies when searching for nectar. It optimizes numerical problems by converting them to the problem of finding the best parameter to minimize an objective function. The algorithm moves towards better solutions, while abandoning poor solutions.
Grid-forming inverters create adjustable voltage and frequency and can operate microgrids without conventional synchronous power generators. They can also act as primary mechanisms to improve grid synchronization, especially during low-inertia operating conditions.
The group said the proposed inverter design can work optimally on both grid-connected and islanding conditions. It combines these two different control strategies by using a Fractional Order based Proportional–Integral (FOPI) controller – a way of adding additional parameters to the algorithm.
“The FOPI controller has a higher degree of freedom compared to conventional PI controllers, and the objective of error minimization can be done more effectively,” it explained, adding that it used Monte Carlo simulations typically deployed to assess unpredictable outcomes influenced by random variables, by reducing complex processes to a set of basic events and interactions. “Monte Carlo simulation has been performed to generate the initial optimal search space.”
The controller can also operate following an adapting stopping criterion, which the scientists said helps the algorithm to stop early if a solution convergence is found. This makes the algorithm faster and more effective compared to other different optimization algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO), which were also tested by the group with the same inverter design.
PSO is a stochastic optimization method based on the movement and intelligence of swarms, to minimize the CoE of both energy sources in the modeling. The GWO algorithm mimics the hierarchy and hunting mechanism of grey wolves in nature.
The controllers work on quality data (qd) mode and reportedly help the inverter find the optimal solution by reducing the uncertainty of trapping into a suboptimal solution. Their operation was simulated under different scenarios such as different islanding-grid reconnecting times and their performance was tested during load changes, as well as during changes in line parameters.
Through the simulation, the scientists ascertained that crucial parameters such as frequency, voltage dq quantity, and real and reactive power reached the steady-state or the allowable range within the desired period. Their performance was found to be “satisfactory” for each load level.
The new inverter design is presented in the paper “Integrated grid forming-grid following inverter fractional order controller based on Monte Carlo Artificial Bee Colony Optimization,” published in Energy Reports.

The cost of producing solar cells based on compounds of III-V element materials, named according to the groups of the periodic table that they belong to, has confined these devices to niche applications, such as drones and satellites, where low weight and high efficiency are more pressing concerns than the cost of energy produced.
“Reducing manufacturing costs is considered key to terrestrial applications, and one way to accomplish this is by having the ability to repeatedly reuse the substrate upon which the cells are grown,” noted the researchers. This was the motivation to develop acoustic spalling, a new process which they claim represents a low-cost reuse pathway for III–V epitaxial growth substrates with recovery and reuse of the substrate.
In the paper “GaAs solar cells grown on acoustically spalled GaAs substrates with 27% efficiency,” which was recently published in Joule, the researchers explained that the acoustic spalling, which is also known as a sonic lift-off (SLO), is an experimental process that utilizes sound waves to control the propagation of the crack tip during the spall in order to suppress facet formation and improve surface flatness.
“Existing technology uses a sacrificial etch layer, which allows a cell to be lifted off a gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate so that the substrate can be used again, but the process takes hours and leaves behind a residue that requires a polishing step,” the group explained. “Polishing is relatively expensive and limits the potential cost savings of this substrate reuse method. In contrast, spalling takes seconds, creating a controlled fracture within the substrate nearly parallel to its surface. This fracture allows the cell to be easily removed, revealing a new, contaminant-free surface from within the substrate that does not require polishing.”
The academics built PV devices with an n-i-p structure and a 1 mm-thick emitter made of GaAs and selenium (SE), a 1 mm unintentionally doped GaAs layer, and a 1 mm base layer made of GaAs and zinc (Zn) on an as-spalled SLO substrate without wet etching.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the champion device fabricated with this architecture achieved a certified power conversion efficiency of 26.9%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.061 V, a short-circuit current of 29.9 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 84.9%, with the cell exhibiting no signs of non-linear shunting, which reduces the current flowing through the solar cell junction and reduces the voltage from the solar cell.
“These results enable the epitaxial growth of high-performance devices on potentially lower-cost substrates with mm-scale features,” the researchers said, adding that the acoustic spalling utilized for building the cells was developed at Arizona State University and is now being commercialized by Phonenix-based startup Crystal Sonic Inc. “This latest advancement uses acoustic spalling, or sound waves, to control the fracture, suppress the formation of facets, and improve the flatness of the substrate.
In July 2022, other researchers from the NREL developed a III-V solar cell based on a substrate made of spalled germanium (Ge). They used spalled Ge instead of gallium arsenide (GaAs), as the former, which is commonly used in space applications, reportedly reduces several issues associated with GaAs spalling.
This solar cell was able to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 23.36% where no spalling defects were present. It also achieved an open-circuit voltage of 1.019 V, a short-circuit current density of 28.49 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 80.45%. According to the scientists, these results show that spalled germanium does not need to be returned to a pristine, polished state to achieve high-quality device performance.

The material’s potential application in batteries was investigated in the past, but to no avail.
Now, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the United States have developed lab-scale lithium-ion battery cells with non-pre-lithiated aluminum-foil-based negative electrodes with improved energy density and stability.
“This is a story about a material that was known about for a long time, but was largely abandoned early on in battery development,” said Associate Professor Matthew McDowell. “But with new knowledge, combined with a new technology — the solid-state battery — we've figured out how we can rejuvenate the idea and achieve really promising performance.”
Instead of using pure aluminum in the foils, which would fail rapidly when tested in batteries, the research team added small amounts of other materials to the aluminum to create foils with particular “microstructures,” or arrangements of different materials. They tested over 100 different materials to understand how they would behave in batteries.
The new aluminum foil anode demonstrated markedly improved performance and stability when implemented in solid-state batteries, as opposed to conventional lithium-ion batteries. The lab-scale cells deliver hundreds of stable cycles with practically relevant areal capacities at high current densities (6.5 mA cm−2)
“One of the benefits of our aluminum anode that we're excited about is that it enables performance improvements, but it also can be very cost-effective,” McDowell said. “On top of that, when using a foil directly as a battery component, we actually remove a lot of the manufacturing steps that would normally be required to produce a battery material.”
The project began as a collaboration between the Georgia Tech team and Atlanta-based aluminum manufacturer and recycler Novelis. The researchers are now working to scale up the size of the batteries to understand how size influences the behavior of aluminum.

Transgrid, the transmission network operator in the Australian state of New South Wales, said services provided by grid-scale battery energy storage systems have been identified as part of the preferred option to resolve emerging network constraints in the Bathurst, Orange and Parkes area.
Transgrid, the operator and manager of the high-voltage electricity transmission network in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, said a thorough assessment of options had identified big batteries as the best way forward in terms of providing the biggest benefits for the two network growth regions.
“Our grid is changing, which is why we’re going beyond the traditional poles and wires approach and embracing new technologies and business models to meet the needs of consumers and keep the system reliable,” said Transgrid Executive General Manager of Network Marie Jordan. “We’re looking to purchase services from providers who own and operate battery storage. This approach helps meet growing demand in both regions faster than upgrading the existing network.”
Transgrid is seeking services from two separate battery energy storage systems to be installed at substations near Panorama and Parkes, and another big battery to be installed near Narrabri or Gunnedah in the North West Slopes region.
Jordan said the grid-scale batteries will provide dynamic reactive support to manage voltage variations on Transgrid’s network during high demand periods, from 2025 or soon thereafter.
“These services will help us unlock extra capacity on the transmission network and use the existing network better and avoid interruptions to supply for consumers,” she said. “The service providers can also use the batteries to trade in the energy market when not needed to support Transgrid’s network, so it’s a win-win for the power system.”
Transgrid modeling indicates electricity demand will increase substantially in the Bathurst, Orange and Parkes areas and the North West Slopes region in the near future due to the connection of new industrial loads and general load growth.
The network operator said multiple options to address emerging load constraints in both areas have been examined and, in each case, the best option involved services provided by third-party battery energy storage facilities.
Jordan said the project is amongst the first in the National Electricity Market where a solution involving large-scale batteries has outperformed other options throughout the Regulatory Investment Test for Transmission (RIT-T).
“It is another sign of how rapidly our energy system is changing and how we need to adapt and embrace new technology as we embark on the energy transition,” she said.
Figures provided by Transgrid show the proposals from third-party battery operators had outperformed the poles and wires solutions, promising to deliver up to AUD 2,550 million ($1,717 million) in net benefits in the Orange and Parkes area and $459 million in net benefits in the North West Slopes region.
Transgrid will now enter a competitive procurement process and begin commercial negotiations with non-network proponents to put contracts in place. The network operator will host a market forum on Aug. 10, with potential service providers invited to register.
Subject to approvals, the batteries could be completed by 2024-25.

As the United States pursues a wholesale shift from a fossil fuel-based energy system to one defined by renewables, it is an all-hands-on-deck scenario to stay on track to meet climate goals. Some of these hands may turn out to be robotic. 
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) projects demand for 800,000 new solar workers by 2030 to build the projects the United States needs to stay on pace with its decarbonization plan. However, 44% of solar industry employers report that it is “very difficult” to find qualified applicants, according to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC). 
With this challenge in mind, solar developers are increasingly exploring and implementing autonomous, robotic versions of solar installers, particularly at the utility scale. Two companies making recent moves are Terabase Energy and Sarcos Robotics Corp. 
Terabase secures funding
Terabase Energy, the developer of the Terafab automated installation system, says it recently secured $25 million in funding. The capital raise was led by Prelude Ventures, SJF Ventures, and EDP Ventures to support a commercial scale-up of its technology.
The company describes Terafab as an automated “field factory” that can double installation productivity. The installation system makes use of digital twins, logistics software, an on-site digital command center, a field-deployed automated assembly line, and installation rovers that can operate 24/7.
Terabase also opened a manufacturing facility this year in Woodland, California, and described it as “a factory to make factories.” The facility is currently manufacturing the first gigawatt Terafab assembly line, with capacity to make more than 10 GW of Terafabs per year.
Terabase said its system will double labor productivity compared to traditional utility-scale installation methods. The system offers high-throughput, 24/7 operation, and modularity to enable rapid ramp-ups and higher solar field construction speeds, significantly reducing project schedules. 
“We successfully field-tested Terafab last year, building 10 MW of a 400 MW site in Texas,” said Matt Campbell, chief executive officer and co-founder of Terabase. “[This] launch is the next step forward to rapid commercial scale-up.”
Terafab is pegged for commercial deployment starting in the third quarter of 2023. The company said that the automated installation system reduces the levelized cost of electricity for utility-scale solar projects. It is also scalable, built on a modular design that can be replicated and deployed quickly.
Blattner and Sarcos
Blattner Company recently partnered with Sarcos Robotics to optimize employee safety and enhance the efficiency of PV module installation for utility-scale solar projects.
“We are extremely optimistic about the use of robots for solar construction to help address the workforce shortages, productivity, and safety challenges that are currently slowing down the progress of US solar initiatives,” said Matt Hadsell, senior manager-innovation and development for Blattner.
Sarcos’ proof-of-concept robotic system consists of an autonomous working vehicle, featuring the company’s Guardian XM robotic arm and an autonomous delivery vehicle. The solution uses cameras to identify where the PV panels need to be installed. The robotic arm then autonomously lifts up the panel using a vacuum system and places it approximately where it needs to be clamped to the mounting structure.
“The arm then goes into a special mode where the person clamping the panel can easily move that panel however they need, in order to align it and attach it into the panels,” Sarcos explains in a video on its website.
The partnership will build upon the Sarcos Outdoor Autonomous Manipulation of Photovoltaic Panels (O-AMPP) project, which is funded through the support of the US Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO). The O-AMPP project started in 2021 and Sarcos expects to commercialize its solution by late 2024.
