pv magazine asked the European Commission for confirmation and a reason for the delay. A spokesperson said that preparatory work for the plan is “ongoing” but they could not provide a precise date for when it will be released.
EHPA secretary general Thomas Nowak said postponing the release of the Heat Pump Action Plan – a four-pronged policy aiming to accelerate heat pump deployment and support the market – is a “mistake.”
Shifting the publication date will not only impact the sector, which has already reported sluggish sales impacted by “weak” EU laws, but could also put €7 billion worth of European investment at risk, he said. “We urge President von der Leyen, Commissioner for Energy Simson and all Commissioners to review and revert it urgently,” Nowak said.
“It will impact Europe’s path to net zero and all the consumers who want nothing more than to be able to choose affordable and sustainable clean heating.”
Public consultation for the plan opened from April to May this year, receiving over 130 responses from business owners, developers and industry players on how the policy should be shaped and implemented.
Several economic and non-economic barriers are hampering Europe’s heat pump rollout, and as a result, deployment cannot match “the speed required for the energy transition,” according to a submission from Italian energy provider Enel.
“The risk of supply chain disruptions is becoming an increasing matter of concern for the large-scale roll-out of heat pumps,” the submission reads.
The workforce lacks skilled installers which is leading to a “bottleneck” of European projects, according to a submission from EuropeOn – a Belgium-based association representing the interests of electrical contractors.
“Investing in VET programs and schools, making apprenticeships appealing for prospective students and for employers, and ensuring parity of esteem between technical education and academia,” could be one way of addressing this shortcoming, according to the submission.
In June the EHPA and 23 other organizations released their own heat pump acceleration plan, which states that if the EU wants to install 60 million heat pumps by the end of the decade – of which 20 million are currently in use – it needs to address information and affordability, workforce shortage and other issues.
Meanwhile, research firm EUPD said heat pump sales have steadily increased throughout the year in Germany “despite the lack of planning certainty caused by the subsidy structure and budget freeze,” according to the press release.
Almost 300,000 heat pumps were sold in the northern European country as of the third quarter of 2023, which well surpassed last year’s sales figures of 236,000, the EUPD said. Despite this growth, the organization warns that data provided by the federal economics office, the Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle, shows that subsidy applications are dwindling. Applications dropped by 73% from 29,060 monthly applications in 2022 to 7,845 per month in 2023, according to the data.
“However, it is important to distinguish between sales or customer demand for heat pumps and the number of subsidy applications,” it said in the press release. “Despite the decline in subsidy applications, the sales performance of heat pumps has remained strong from quarter to quarter.”

Solar panel permit wait times not exceeding three months; solar panel rooftop installations and projects under 50 kW not requiring environmental impact assessments; and heat pump permit-granting processes not exceeding one month for installations below 50 MW and three months for ground-source heat pumps are among the renewable energy-relevant directives.
“It is appropriate to promote and accelerate the deployment of small-scale solar installations, including for renewables self-consumers and collective self-consumers, such as local energy communities, since those are the options that cost least, are most accessible and have the least environmental or other type of impact for a fast roll-out of new renewable installations,” the legislation states.
European Council Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge Minister Teresa Ribera said extending the raft of emergency measures was necessary to address the “still-fragile” situation in the EU following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“This will allow us to ensure the stabilization of the energy markets, alleviate the effect of the crisis and protect EU citizens from excessive high energy prices,” she said.
Regulation (EU) 2022/2577 was first introduced in Dec. 2022 to tackle rising energy prices, reduce the EU’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels and advance climate emergency initiatives, according to the document. Its levers are designed to target technologies that can be implemented in the short term and have “large” potential for reducing gas consumption and energy bills.
Other energy instruments in the recent announcement include extending the monitoring of European gas prices and issuing notices when price breaches occur, as well as “enhancing solidarity through better coordination of gas purchases” through revised legislative language.
Meanwhile, the European Heat Pump Association (EHPA) has come out today slamming the European Commission for delaying the publication of its hotly-anticipated Heat Pump Action Plan. According to the EHPA press release, it will now be released after the European Union elections in June next year.
“Postponing the finalisation of this plan to after the election can only be called a mistake,” EHPA Secretary General Thomas Nowak said.
“We urge President von der Leyen, Commissioner for Energy Simson and all Commissioners to review and revert it urgently.”

On Nov. 4, a 25-year-old man who worked as a technician and did maintenance work on a production line was injured in an explosion. He died late last week due to severe burns.
“Formal investigations are underway to determine precisely what led to the accident in November, but our current understanding is that we had a dust explosion in a machine that is not directly a part of the battery manufacturing process,” Matti Kataja, Northvolt director of communication and public affairs Nordics, told pv magazine. “Thorough risk assessments have been made and mitigating actions have been taken.”
In a separate incident, a man in his 60s, employed by construction contractor NCC, died after a fork stand fell on him and a 20-year-old man. The younger individual suffered serious injuries. NCC was building a concrete foundation for Northvolt’s battery factory expansion when the accident occurred.
“The accident last Thursday occurred outside during construction work. The precise circumstances and events which led up to the accident are under investigation. Northvolt is in dialogue with all relevant stakeholders,” said Kataja. “One person is being treated at hospital, but not in critical condition.”
The factory in Skelleftea, also known as Northvolt Ett, is the manufacturer’s first gigafactory. It aims to ramp up the facility to 60 GWh of annual manufacturing capacity – enough to produce batteries for 1 million electric vehicles per year.
In December 2021, Northvolt became the first manufacturer to produce lithium-ion battery cells that are fully designed, developed and assembled by a homegrown European battery company. The first cells rolled off its manufacturing lines at Northvolt Ett, which initially aimed for 16 GWh of battery capacity per year.
Later on, Northvolt has revealed plans for the expansion of the Skelleftea plant, as well as for three more factories in Germany, Canada, and Sweden.

Germany's Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH) has confirmed the result.
Longi said the result was enabled through a new laser graphical process that costs less than conventional high-cost photolithography processes.
“This substitution has effectively reduced the cost of the BC cell,” the company said in a statement, noting that the HBC architecture also minimizes the reliance on traditional indium-based transparent conductive oxide (ITO). “This breakthrough has propelled the commercialization of HBC solar cells, featuring independent intellectual property and cost-effectiveness.”
In early November, Longi announced a power conversion efficiency of 33.9% for a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell.
It claimed the world’s highest efficiency for silicon cells in November 2022, with a 26.81% efficiency rating for an unspecified heterojunction solar cell.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/20/downsizing-concentrating-photovoltaics/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 20, 2023",Downsizing concentrating photovoltaics,"Scientists at the Polytechnic University of Madrid have developed a miniaturized concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) cell technology that promises lower production costs and a much cheaper assembly of the CPV modules.
“Micro concentrator photovoltaics (micro-CPV) is an evolution of the conventional CPV technology,” the research's lead author, Norman Jost, told pv magazine. “The main goal of our work was the reduction in size of the solar cell and concentrator lens pair, which allows for an abundance of benefits such as lower transmission losses, better distribution of currents and temperatures, and an overall more compact module resembling sizes of standard silicon modules.”
Jost acknowledged that the CPV technology will not likely achieve the low prices of silicon PV but he also said that CPV has some interesting applications. “The most conventional is the deployment in places where the available space is limited and high power is needed,” he explained. “As these systems are actively tracking the sun they could be considered for some transportation cases such as boats.”
The scientist explained that their work on micro-CPV is a review that collects all that has been done in the field to date. “It could be used as a guide for anyone who would like to start research in this field or any company that is interested in developing a product,” Jost further explained.
In the study “Integrated Micro-Scale Concentrating Photovoltaics: A Scalable Path Toward High-Efficiency, Low-Cost Solar Power,” published in Solar RRL, the researchers explained that the CPV technology has been trapped for years in a chicken-and-egg dilemma, with developers failing to reduce high costs and achieve the promised efficiencies.
“The lack of sufficient commercial deployment has prevented the benefit of cost reduction associated with the learning curve of the technology, whereas the lack of competitiveness compared to conventional PV prevented large-scale market development of the technology,” the group explained.
To partially solve these financial and technical issues, the academics said the CPV technology's fundamentals may be improved by miniaturizing both the CPV cells and the optical components, and by adopting a CPV module assembly scheme that is closer to that of the PV industry.
The review reports on all previous attempts to build micro-CPV cells and also includes the most recent industrial and scientific developments. It presents innovations such as molded glass array lenses, parallel interconnection of solar cells with screen-printing, lenses manufactured by roll-to-plate and roll-to-roll with UV curable resins.
“This review scrutinizes the state of the art of the technology, covering advances on micro solar cell development, solar cell assembly solutions, functional interconnection of the micro solar cells, novel optical designs and manufacturing, the integration of hybrid micro-CPV/silicon PV, and internal tracking within a compact, flat module,” the research team stressed.
According to Jost, downsizing CPV may result in advantages such as a short optical path, better thermal management, lower resistive losses, low weight, and a compact module form factor similar to that of silicon PV. “Additional features include internal tracking and hybrid CPV/silicon-PV.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/20/control-tech-for-modular-gravity-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 20, 2023",Control tech for modular gravity storage,"A group of researchers led by China's State Grid Smart Grid Research Institute has developed a plant control system for modular gravity energy storage (M-GES).
“Our work represents the first attempt at creating an energy control strategy with excellent performance for M-GES power plants,” the research's lead author, Wenxuan Tong, told pv magazine. “We proposed and validated for the first time the maximum height difference control. A detailed mathematical model of the energy management system of the M-GES plant is also presented for the first time.”
M-GES differentiates from monolithic GES as it uses several standardized blocks instead of a single giant block. According to the researchers, utilizing modular weights offers more flexibility in output power, ease of mass production of related equipment and better flexibility in the selection of weights.
“Currently, most of the studies in the field of M-GES are focused on the proposal of new technology routes and preliminary verification of technical feasibility,” the researchers explained. “However, the M-GES plants need further study of its control technology to apply in the actual power grid with its role as a grid power regulator.”
In the study “Energy management system for modular-gravity energy storage plant,” published in the Journal of Energy Storage, the research team explained that the management system consists of three different parts: the monitoring prediction system (MPS); the energy management system (EMS); and the power control system (PCS). The three parts communicate with each other through the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.
The MPS performs real-time grid status monitoring and receives inputs from the dispatch center based on the grid status. It is responsible for optimal interaction between the M-GES plant and the grid. The PCS is responsible for power balancing and coordinating the operation of the units in the M-GES plant.
The EMS coordinates the operation of the different blocks of the GES plant. “The EMS of an M-GES plant will be more complex than the GES plant based on independent blocks because of the involvement of coordinated control between multiple blocks,” said the academics.
The EMS also reportedly addresses one of the main hurdles that module gravity storage needs to deal with, which is its state-of-charge (SOC). The SOC is the amount of energy stored in an energy storage system relative to its full capacity. To solve this issue, the research team adopted a SOC model and a maximum height difference (MHC) energy control strategy.
“Losses are generated whenever the unit is switched on and off, including the inherent losses during start-up and stop, the overall operating efficiency of the unit can be improved if the stable operating time of the unit can be extended,” the scientists explained.” Adopting an energy control strategy with a longer unit operating cycle is appropriate from the unit’s perspective.”
The researchers validated their approach on the MATLAB/Simulink platform and found the MHC improves power stability and efficiency of an M-GES plant by keeping the SOC above half, with this advantage becoming more relevant as the SOC increases.
“The proposed energy management system performs well in natural power systems,” Tong stated.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/20/ark-energy-secures-approval-for-worlds-largest-8-hour-lithium-battery/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",CARRIE HAMPEL,"DECEMBER 20, 2023",Ark Energy secures approval for world’s largest 8-hour lithium battery,"From pv magazine Australia
The Richmond Valley Battery Energy Storage System lithium-iron phosphate battery system is being developed at the proposed Richmond Valley Solar Farm site at Myrtle Creek by Ark Energy, which, along with the Sun Metals Zinc Refinery in Queensland, is a subsidiary of Korea Zinc.
The battery project, which will use lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) technology, will have a power capacity of 275 MW and an energy storage capacity of up to 2,200-MWh over eight hours. With existing and planned projects globally, this constitutes the largest eight-hour lithium-ion battery project in the world to date.
Behind the large-scale project, Korea Zinc is already working on other energy storage mechanisms closer to its Townsville base, from where it supplies much of Asia with non-ferrous metals. The Richmond Valley project is being developed by Ark Energy which has a mandate to provide Korea Zinc with enough renewable energy for the production of green zinc.
The Richmond Valley battery project is one of five energy infrastructure projects representing 750 MW of renewable energy generation and 524 MW/4,192 MWh of long-duration storage that have been successful to the New South Wales (NSW) government’s latest tender round as it prepares for the exit of coal-fired power generation from the state’s electricity grid.
“NSW is now almost halfway there on our 2030 renewable generation target, and over a quarter of the way there on our long-duration storage target,” said NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe.
The five successful projects represent AUD 4.2 billion ($2.84 billion) in private sector investment in NSW’s renewable energy infrastructure. The energy storage projects are expected to be operational by 2028 and are expected to contribute an estimated 1,000 jobs, AUD 2 billion in local supply chain benefits and AUD 40 million towards First Nations initiatives.
With an energy storage capacity of up to 2.2 GWh over eight hours, the Richmond Valley durational battery storage project exceeds other big batteries planned for Australia and globally including Akaysha’s Waratah Super Battery which has a capacity of 850 MW/1,680 MWh and the Orana battery in NSW that clocks in 415 MW/1,660 MWh. It is also larger than Synergy’s 500 MW / 2,000 MWh Collie battery in WA and has six hours more capacity than Equis’ 1,200 MW/2.4 GWh (two hours) Melbourne Renewable Energy Hub battery project.
The Richmond Valley battery project will be built alongside the proposed Richmond Valley Solar Farm being developed near Casino in northern NSW. The project includes the construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning of the solar farm with a capacity of 500 MW. The project includes the installation of approximately one million PV panels on a mounted tracking system and will connect to the grid via the Coffs Harbour to Lismore 330 kV powerline that transects the site.
Australia’s leadership in renewable durational battery storage lies in its ideal circumstances for large-scale solar. The combination of available land, high solar coverage, a comparatively high level of technological infrastructure and functional governance are all elements that make Australia an ideal breeding ground for renewable energy projects such as the Richmond Valley battery.
Australian conditions make it ideal for industrial giants such as Korea Zinc, the world’s largest producer of zinc, lead and silver, and its subsidiaries.
Korea Zinc is currently trying to organise its supply chains so it can avoid exclusion from battery production in the US with the new FEOC regulations (‘foreign entities of concern’) – basically trying to reduce the total dependence on China for all things battery-related.
The company is also ramping up its renewable energy production – with Ark Energy, among others – as well as ramping up its recycling activities to keep critical raw materials in production loops. According to US stipulations, if battery materials were originally produced in China but recycled outside of FEOC, these materials regain eligibility for US subsidies.
The clean production of energy and short transport distances mark two important issues in compliance with standards for government investments in important industries. Refining zinc takes a lot of energy. If battery materials are not produced and transported with the lowest possible carbon footprint, they face exclusion from many governmental support schemes globally as countries try to decarbonise their industries.
Ark Energy is tasked with decarbonising the Korea Zinc subsidiary Sun Metal’s Townsville zinc refinery. The plant is currently Queensland’s second biggest electricity user and chews up between AUD 50 million to AUD 80 million in energy costs each year.
Korea Zinc has recognised Australia’s combination of assets, making it one of the world’s ideal locations for industrial activity, with production on-site reducing excessive transportation costs of renewable energy – particularly from neighbouring regions with high energy needs.
In terms of durational storage, lithium battery projects are said to be limited to eight hours of storage potential. The use of lithium for durational storage pits it in competition with transportation needs as the world’s transport industries transition off fossil fuels. Vehicle batteries have higher demands of battery performance and are, therefore, not as flexible as the frameworks applying to stationary storage in terms of alternative methods.
Lithium battery storage systems typically last four to eight hours. As renewable energy generation becomes a higher share of the grid, it will require longer durations and technologies with different characteristics to simulate a “base load” generation mix.
Besides lithium battery storage systems, “mid- to long-term” storage technologies such as iron air or zinc-based battery storage systems (which still have other drawbacks) boast the use of significantly more abundant materials. Renewable energy stored in green hydrogen can make electricity available months later. Gravitational storage provides a duration of 4-24 hours and has a lifespan of up to 35 years.
Korea Zinc is covering all options. In November, Ark Energy broke ground on its SunHQ green hydrogen hub. The industrial group is also getting primed to export energy to those places less well-endowed with the combination of sun and space – such as most of densely populated Asia – by means of a renewable energy hub in Queensland.
In terms of durational energy storage potential, publications in China point to gravity energy being one of the most tenable energy storage mechanisms for durational storage, also mentioning Vault Energy as an industry leader in this regard. Compared to other methods, gravity-based storage does not need to rely on research years or decades in the future, has a low environmental footprint, no supply chain issues, and is flexible and scalable, making it versatile for both small- and large-scale energy storage.
In 2022, Korea Zinc signed a partnership with Vault Energy. The Swiss company’s gravitational EVx storage system works like pumped hydro. It uses power when supply is abundant to drive motors and raise 30-tonne blocks made of soil and waste materials, rather than water, up to a height. When energy is needed – irrespective of whether the sun is shining or the wind is blowing – the blocks are lowered, which releases their potential energy to generate electricity.
Pumped storage has been around for a long time, but utilising moving mass is relatively new, and Energy Vault is considered a leader in this area. Energy Vault says the technology is not dependent on specific terrain, lasts four to 24 hours, and has a lifespan of up to 35 years.

The US House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Republican members sent a joint letter to the LPO on Dec. 7. They expressed “outrage” over a reported incident of an elderly man allegedly being pressured into a 25-year solar lease by a salesperson. The joint letter is being used to highlight the aggressive or potentially misleading sales tactics that are sometimes employed by contractors of national residential solar companies.
This incident reflects a complex situation. Republicans in Congress are seeking to undermine the transition to local, clean electricity by signaling “outrage,” meanwhile, solar sales companies are grappling with the challenges posed by commission-motivated private contractors, whose sales tactics strain the industry’s reputation.
Residential solar companies have had lawsuits initiated by state attorneys general in Arizona, New Mexico, and Connecticut, largely due to aggressive sales tactics. These same in-home sales techniques prompted California to mandate a comprehensive 24-page Solar Consumer Protection Guide in 2021.
The joint letter, addressed to the LPO’s department head, Jigar Shah, specifically addresses Sunnova’s recently awarded $3 billion loan guarantee. This significant loan from the LPO is earmarked to finance up to 90% of “Project Hestia.” The project’s aim is to broaden access to solar and virtual power plant (VPP) services, particularly for disadvantaged communities that typically struggle to secure financing for residential projects.
Sunnova stands out in the industry for integrating individual residential solar and storage installations into the broader power grid. Despite the initial rejection of their Califlornia microutility, its innovative approach is recognized as cutting edge, and will set precedent for future energy deployments.
The joint letter details allegations of unethical sales practices of a Sunnova contractor. It describes an instance of alleged exploitation: “a door-to-door Sunnova salesman sold her father – who she characterized as in hospice care—a $60,000 solar system for his mobile home shortly before his death.” It also references complaints from a 2019 article regarding Sunnova’s expanding market in Puerto Rico.
The committee requests all documents related to Sunnova’s loan approval, previous sales complaints, consumer protection measures, and the company’s financial status. They also inquire about LPO’s oversight of Sunnova’s sales practices.
