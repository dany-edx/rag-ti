The hydrogen platform will be driven by surplus power generated by wind turbines. It will combine a seawater desalination system and a system to extract hydrogen from water through electrolysis. The project is being developed in partnership with the international arm of the Scottish government and Scottish Development International, which has helped J-DeEP to conduct the feasibility study.
“ClassNK conducted a safety evaluation on J-DeEP’s design of the plant in line with its rules and guidelines,” the organization said in a statement. “Upon confirming that the design complied with the relevant requirements, ClassNK has issued AiP.”
According to a recent study from the University College Cork in Ireland, the coupling of high-capacity floating offshore wind with green hydrogen production could be an important opportunity to further decarbonize the energy sector. The scientists have presented three project typologies based on variables such as electrolyzer technologies, floating wind platforms, and energy transmission. The typologies include offshore systems based on centralized onshore electrolysis, decentralized offshore electrolysis, and centralized offshore electrolysis.
“The energy transmission vector was the key feature of the three typologies discussed with emphasis on the major components of the systems, to limit the complexity of the paper while highlighting more detailed topics for future analysis,” the scientists said.
They have found that the centralized system design is less complex than its decentralized counterparts, as it offers more cost-effective options for some components.
“For example, the ongoing development work in scale up of large size cost-effective electrolyzers may lead to cheaper hydrogen. On the other hand, the challenge to the centralized system is in the event of a failure, hydrogen production would cease for the whole farm,” they explained. “The centralized offshore system also has additional capex of a floating vessel accommodating the electrolysis facility.”
They explained their approach in “Dedicated large-scale floating offshore wind to hydrogen: Assessing design variables in proposed typologies,” which was recently published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Review.

The country now aims to expand the development of offshore wind and nuclear power, but it has also left some room for more solar energy and green hydrogen.
“We will also look to increase the UK’s current 14 GW of solar capacity which could grow up to five times by 2035, consulting on the rules for solar projects, particularly on domestic and commercial rooftops,” the government said in a statement. “We will aim to double our ambition to up to 10GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030, with at least half coming from green hydrogen and utilising excess offshore wind power to bring down costs.”
Through the new plan, the government hopes to develop another 24 GW of nuclear power by 2050 and 50 GW of offshore wind by 2030. “We will run a Heat Pump Investment Accelerator Competition in 2022, worth up to GBP 30 million ($39 million), to make British heat pumps, which reduce demand for gas,” the government said.
Energy and Climate Change Minister Greg Hands noted that Britain does not rely on Russian energy, but he highlighted the importance of accelerating the transition to renewable energy. He did not provide any additional details about how the proposed targets will be achieved. The new targets follow the recent announcement of plans to reduce the value-added tax on heat pumps and solar modules for residential applications, from 5% to 0%.

The Austrian PV industry has been patient, but help has finally come. The financing and regulatory framework for solar rebates under the Renewable Energy Sources Expansion Act (EAG) has been enacted, with the 2022 edition of the program scheduled to start on April 21.
Bundesverband Photovoltaic Austria (PV Austria) said it welcomes the new program design.
“Important demands … such as quadrupling the funding budget to €240 million ($261.4 million), doubling the number of possible applications, increasing the funding rates and the ability to combine federal, municipal and state funding for systems up to 100 kilowatt-peak, were among our proposals,” said PV Austria CEO Herbert Paierl.
The new provisions will provide significant support for solar deployment in Austria.
“The first agreement between the governing parties on how the energy transition in the electricity sector can be steered with state funds was already in place with the EAG in the summer of 2021. With the current definition of financial resources and conditions, we are finally stepping out of the shadows and into the solar revolution,” said Vera Immitzer, managing director of PV Austria.
Under the new version of the program, PV projects that were previously put on hold can now be implemented. End customers can also finally order PV systems, as the new funding conditions are finally clear.

Interested companies have until April 12 to download the relevant documents to participate in the auction.
The procurement exercise is part of a plan to tender almost 12 GW of capacity and follows the recent publication of South Africa’s new Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). The IRP aims for up to 6 GW of new large-scale solar by 2030, as well as up to 6 GW of distributed-generation PV capacity.
“With South Africa still dealing with load shedding, economic recovery post-Covid-19, and its Just Transition away from coal to meet climate emission reduction goals, there’s a need to procure these projects quickly and connect them to the grid, Blue Horizon Energy Consulting Services’ Chris Ahlfeldt tells pv magazine. “The transmission capacity constraints in the Northern Cape made it difficult for some developers in Round 5, so most will likely target other provinces for Round 6 and has the potential benefit of spreading local socio-economic impacts from the projects to other parts of the country.”
The fifth round of the REIPPPP scheme was launched in March 2021. Overall, the South African authorities allocated 2.6 GW of renewable energy capacity across 25 projects ranging in size from 75 MW to 140 MW.
The procurement exercise's lowest bid of ZAR 0.34425 ($0.02338) was submitted for a 124 MW wind facility to be built in Hantam, in the Northern Cape region. For solar, the lowest price was ZAR 0.37479, which was offered for six 75 MW solar parks set for construction in Tokologo, an administrative area in the Lejweleputswa District of the Free State region.

Now a new, lightweight solution built on closed water covers can bring solar generation for C&I producers with water reservoirs.
Genap is a 70-year old company – based in Arnhem, the Netherlands – that specializes in membrane solutions for water storage in agriculture. It showed off its Genap Energy Cover this week at the Fruit Logistica trade fair in Berlin. It works with fellow Arnhem-based flexible PV manufacturer HyET Solar to glue thin-film flexible panels to the membrane.
The modules in use are HyET Solar PowerFoil 115 modules, made to custom lengths for the cover. Each module is glued in place. Lightweight styrofoam is placed between the module and cover to act as a float.
Chrétien Hendriks, business development manager for Genap, told pv magazine that the idea came from the lack of available land and the efficiency benefits of lower operating temperatures for solar on water.
“Right now the payback period is around eight years, with the aim to get it down to five to six. But the normal covers we sell have a warranty of 15 years,” said Hendriks. “We're also looking at ways to remove already-glued modules to reuse them on new covers.”

The company’s novel use of membranes and thin-film solar secured a finalist position in Fruit Logistica’s Innovation Awards for 2022. Curiously competing with an onion that doesn't cause tears, a cauliflower with an edible stem, a new type of tomato, and other food innovations, the Genap Energy Cover offers tangible benefits for land-scarce locations, while adding conventional anti-algae and evaporation prevention.
Initially, the target market is local, focusing on water storage for agricultural and floristry greenhouses in the Netherlands. A pilot was placed on a reservoir at Wageningen University and Research in Bleiswijk in September 2021. The facility is approximately sized at 35 meters by 12 meters, with the overall output at 12kWp.
Hendriks said increasing the yield is a key goal. “The first generation of these panels in the test setup was around 60W/m2, rising to 120W/m2 in a year from now. And at the end, we’re aiming for around 165W/m2. It’s our first design and we think we can optimize and increase the percentage of the [membrane] that is covered in PV quite a bit higher – we’d like to go to a 90% coverage of the full floater.”
Genap expects to release the Energy Cover in the third quarter of 2022. Hendriks claimed that the capital cost of Genap's floating, flexible PV solution is “less than half as expensive as other floating PV solutions currently available.” Maintenance is simplified with the retractable plastic-foil cover, without the heavy infrastructure of fixed panels, he said. No soiling issues have been noted, as there are cables to deter birds.
Hendriks also noted that a rooftop setup is also being explored with High yield Energy Technologies (HyET) Group, recently majority acquired by Australian-based Fortescue Future Industies. HyET is helping with weight-constrained rooftops that are unable to support the heavy structures of fixed modules.
“We're doing an innovation at the moment with HyET Solar, which is their modules glued onto our foils, with cables already integrated,” said Hendriks. “We’ll tension them and the membrane onto existing roofs, for rooftops that cannot have too much weight for conventional frame structures and glass panels. It's a lightweight roofing solution we're working on.”

“Currently, the application of the solar panels to the kinetic shading devices is very limited so that is not possible to come across any instances implemented in the urban buildings, despite some prototypes,” researcher Ayca Kirimtat told pv magazine. “The basic criterion to consider before implementing such a system still is and will be the return of investment rather than sustainable energy development for green life. The implementation cost of conventional panels is very high for many customers and the tailor-made panels for shading devices would be considerably higher. However, given the fundamentals of new product development, the costs should be automatically lowered by the market, as the demand gets higher.”
Kirimtat and her colleagues said that module orientation is crucial in PVSDs, as it strikes a balance between power generation and the use of sunlight to reduce the heating, cooling, and lighting needs of buildings.
The control strategies used to optimize the performance of solar shades were divided into three groups. Hard control techniques use dynamic systems such as energy and daylight simulation models in order to evaluate the thermal behavior of the buildings. Soft control methods utilize mathematical models to predict system behavior analytically. Other techniques involve reinforcement of learning control and multi-agent control, while hybrid methodologies are based on all of these approaches.
The scientists presented a detailed literature matrix to provide an overview of previous studies on different methods for PVSDs in buildings. It was based on PVSD type, control strategy, and building type, with 77 business cases identified and briefly introduced.
The scientists stressed the importance of considering long-term performance monitoring of PVSDs as a crucial aspect for their viability, as well as the issue of replacing the shades.
“To shorten the payback time of the PVSD systems, relevant control methods should be encouraged to be used in the early design process of these systems,” they said. “However, for each PVSD design, the optimal control method could change based on the climatic characteristics, building type, and orientation.”
Kirimtat said the commercial viability of PVSDs may be accelerated by the green energy policies ruled by the governments.
“Simple and less expensive solutions offered by the competitive market players will be beneficial for this niche market to reach some size. Every market, whether niche or not, would eventually reach the maturity, by definition,” she said.
She estimates that it would be possible to see some instances of PV panels operating on the kinetic shading devices in 10 to 15 years.
The scientists presented their findings in “Control of PV integrated shading devices in buildings: A review,” which was recently published in Building and Environment. The research team includes scientists from the University of Hradec Kralove in Czechia, Auburn University in the United States, and the University of Zilina in Slovakia.
“The major goal of this paper is to offer an interdisciplinary and integrated state-of-the-art of PVSD system practices using various control methods and technologies. A systematic literature review was undertaken in order to conceptualize and offer a full knowledge,” the scientists said.

The project owner is Greek energy producer Hellenic Petroleum, which acquired the project from Juwi in early 2020.
Juwi said the facility was built in 18 months, in what it describes as complex terrain. It consists of 18 project sites constructed with more than 500.000 bifacial modules provided by Chinese manufacturer JinkoSolar.
“Kozani is the highest achievement in the Greek renewable space and the lighthouse which signals the beginning of the de-lignitization era in Western Macedonia,” said Takis Sarris, managing director of Juwi Hellas S.A.
For the realization of the photovoltaic power plant, Juwi had secured a contract in a tender held by the Greek government in April 2019. The project accounted for almost half of the total awarded capacity of 437MW.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) supplied three-quarters of the funds for a €100 million ($108.9 million) Eurobond issued by Hellenic Petroleum for the project. Hellenic Petroleum reportedly plans to develop 600MW of renewables capacity by 2025 and aims to halve its “environmental footprint” this decade.

Better-performing solar cells are a key pathway to the acceleration of the active clean energy revolution. Most solar panels today are silicon-based and have a single junction. The upper theoretical limit of energy absorption efficiency for silicon solar cells, called the Shockley-Queisser limit, is about 33.7%.
Currently, Fraunhofer holds the record for commercial silicon single-junction solar cells at about 26%, so there is much room for improvement to hit the limit. But researchers at Arizona State University and the University of Oklahoma may have discovered a way to burst through the theoretical limit by taking advantage of excess heat.
As much as 50% of the energy absorbed by a solar cell is lost as heat. This excess energy comes as a result of the charged particles in the photovoltaic process taking in more energy than is needed to excite an electron and send it on its way as electricity. The teams are developing pathways to build what are called hot carrier solar cells (HCSC) to combat these thermal energy losses and improve efficiency.
HCSC was first conceived decades ago by R.T. Ross and A.J. Nozik. The two researchers theorized that particles carrying excess heat, or hot carriers, could be isolated and stored in a lattice structure that captures the energy. Experiments proved this was possible, but a functional HCSC cell has not yet been built.
New research in the Journal of Photonics for Energy outlines the many conditions that must be met to bring HCSC from theory to practice. The practice involves creating “satellite valleys” in the band structure of semiconductors, where hot carriers can temporarily be stored without energy loss. The satellite valley changes the kinetic energy of the excess heat particles into potential energy, changing the particle from a loss to one that is stored.
The researchers were able to successfully demonstrate storage of heat through the satellite valley effect by using a indium-gallium-arsenide and aluminum (InGaAs/InAlAs) structure.
The researchers noted that the concept is not a complete solution, and efficiently gathering the stored potential energy as electricity requires further testing. But the demonstration of storing this excess energy opens pathways for a technology that might finally overtake the Shockley-Quiesser limit.
Elsewhere, new technologies such as N-TOPCon and heterojunction (HJT) cells are working toward pushing the needle forward for PV efficiency.

Australia's battery storage fleet surpassed the 1GWh milestone for the first time in 2021, with 756MWh of non-residential capacity – mostly utility-scale, front-of-the-meter projects.
Market intelligence specialist SunWiz said that non-residential battery system deployment was driven by the 450MWh Victorian Big Battery and the 150MWh Wandoan South BESS.
“With more large batteries currently under construction, 2022 is set for another big year,” said SunWiz.
State governments backed big batteries in a number of ways – through the creation of Renewable Energy Zones, power purchase agreements, funding contributions, and direct investment. But there were far fewer announcements of funding for utility-scale systems in 2021 compared to the year before.
However, a number of big batteries were announced in 2021. The announcements came from developers as solar projects started requiring storage, gentailers started looking to replace their coal generation fleets, network owners began addressing grid issues, and miners started taking charge of their power supplies.
SunWiz said the batteries started to increase in duration, with a few announcements of four-hour energy storage indicating that the focus is shifting to bulk energy storage. The residential battery storage market, meanwhile, remained steady in 2021, with 333MWh of systems joining the grid, bringing the cumulative tally in Australia to 2,657MWh.
As state governments backed residential battery storage deployment via rebates and zero-interest loans, Victoria grew to record levels and led the market at the state level, representing 32% of the total installed capacity in Australia. New South Wales came in second and South Australia came third.
Around 8% of all new PV systems installed in 2021 included batteries, down from the peak attachment rate of 12% in 2017, the analysts said. SunWiz has predicted that similar numbers will likely be seen in 2022. This would mean that the Australian market is due for another year of more than 1GWh of new system installations, despite the poor battery pricing outlook.

India-based Gautam Solar has released a new gel battery to meet the energy storage needs of solar plants.
“With recent instances of lithium batteries catching fire, there is a need for safer energy storage devices. Gautam Solar’s Gel batteries are cost-effective, thermally stable, long-lasting, and sealed maintenance-free with no topping up ever required,” said the company.
The product launch is in line with Gautam Solar’s bifacial and monofacial solar panel range for PV plants. The company expects its gel batteries to be a better alternative in the energy storage space than lithium and lead-acid batteries.
Gel batteries offer many advantages over standard batteries when paired with solar PV systems. They are highly durable, lightweight, and can endure extreme temperature fluctuations, which makes these an ideal choice for the renewable energy sector. Gel batteries contain gelled electrolytes, which minimize the risk of evaporation, spillage, and use-related corrosion.
Gautam Solar’s new gel batteries provide a commercially viable energy storage solution for solar energy production. These batteries don’t weigh as much as standard batteries, with excellent deep discharge capability.
“We have designed the product [gel battery] keeping the solar market in mind, and we hope that this could be a solution for battery backup concerns that many commercial players have,” said Gautam Mohanka, managing director of Gautam Solar.
