It has unveiled a new hydrogen testing facility for the validation of its industrial turbines, in order to run blends all the way up to 100% hydrogen. It has also completed manufacturing and testing of its hydrogen turbines for Air Products’ Net-Zero Hydrogen Energy Complex in Edmonton, Canada. In addition, the company has executed a collaboration agreement with HyET and has signed a memorandum of understanding with Green Energy Park.
Masdar and CMA CGM have signed a strategic supply partnership (SSP) for long-term green maritime fuels offtake contracts to supply CMA CGM vessels. “The aim of the partnership is to source, supply and deliver green alternative fuels for CMA CGM’s dual-fuel vessels, in the port of Abu Dhabi, starting in 2025 and following the incremental phase-in of the vessels until 2028,” said Abu Dhabi-based Masdar. “[We] will also continue to discuss extending their collaboration opportunities, potentially on green hydrogen and ammonia production.”
Air Liquide and TotalEnergies have set up the equally owned TEAL Mobility, which “will accelerate the development of hydrogen for heavy-duty trucks by offering a network of 100 stations on major European corridors.” The two French companies said that TEAL Mobility will operate around 20 facilities in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg and Germany from 2024.
Plug Power has started operating the largest liquid green hydrogen plant in the US market.“This is the largest electrolytic liquid hydrogen production plant, and largest PEM electrolyzer deployment operating in the US, representing a landmark achievement in Plug’s build-out of a vertically integrated hydrogen ecosystem,” said the US company. The plant in Woodbine, Georgia, is designed to produce 15 tons per day (TPD) of liquid electrolytic hydrogen via eight 5 MW proton exchange membrane electrolysis (PEM) electrolyzers. The hydrogen gas is then condensed into liquid form at -423 F (-252.8 C) to be delivered to customers’ hydrogen fueling stations through Plug Power’s logistics network using its cryogenic trailers.
Hydrogen Compass said that a total of 25 countries and regions want to export hydrogen. In contrast, nine countries and regions are focusing on hydrogen imports, including several European countries, as well as Japan and Singapore. Hydrogen Compass is a project by acatech and Dechema. “The European countries and regions alone are planning to build 52 gigawatts of production capacity – significantly more than assumed by the Europe 2020 strategy,” said the report. Apart from Europe, also Chile (25 GW) and India (25 GW to 60 GW) have set high targets. Overall, the capacity targets of the 25 strategy papers, which contain quantitative information, add up to between 108 GW and 151 GW. The report also underlines that the countries’ hydrogen strategies report a wide range of hydrogen prices, from €0.60 ($0.65) per kilogram in India to €4.50 per kilogram in South Korea).

The ministry and Shanghai Fengling Renewable, the main investor in the project, and Serbia Zijin Copper, a local subsidiary of Zijin Mining, signed a MoU last week. The agreement envisages the construction of a 1.5 GW wind project, a 500 MW solar plant, and a hydrogen production plant with an annual capacity of around 30,000 metric tons by 2028.
The projects will be located near the town of Bor, eastern Serbia, and used to power nearby copper mine and smelter owned by Zijin. “This project will enable Zijin to produce a significant part of [its] electricity needs in a sustainable way,” said Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic, Serbia’s mining and energy minister.
In 2018, Zijin Mining became Serbia’s strategic partner in the RTB Bor copper mine, pledging to invest $1.26 billion in return for a 63% stake. In 2021, it commissioned the Cukaru Peki copper and gold mine as part of the RTB Bor operation. Last year, the Chinese miner said it was looking to invest a further $3.8 billion in the expansion of its copper mine, which would allow it dig as deep as two kilometers.
According to the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN), China invested €32 billion in the region in 2009-2021 with the Belt and Road Initiative serving as the main driver for expanding the Asian country’s economic presence in the Balkans. In Serbia alone, Chinese investment reached €10.3 billion.
“This investment will help us achieve energy security and independence goals and…reach carbon neutrality by 2050,” said Djedovic Handanovic.
The project is expected to break ground in the first quarter of 2025. The first phase is to be delivered by mid-2026. Djedovic Handanovic said that the project would create between 300 and 500 jobs.
According to the Association of Renewable Energy Sources of Serbia, the country has installed around 60 MW of solar. However, that figure is not exact, as there is no official registry for solar installed for self-consumption at this stage. Last April, Serbia switched on its largest utility-scale solar project, the 9.9 MW DeLasol PV project in the Lapovo, central Serbia.

The manufacturer said its new 108-cell Blackstar B108 420W panel is based on n-type half-cut M10 TOPCon solar cells. It has a power output of 420 W and a power conversion efficiency of 21.51%.
The modules measure 1,722 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh 25 kg. They feature a glass-glass design with a black anodized aluminum frame, with the glass having a thickness of 2 mm. The front side is based on heat-strengthened and anti-reflective glass, while the back side uses float glass.
Its open-circuit voltage is between 50.1 V and 52.6 V and the short-circuit current is of 10.50 A to 10.71 A. Solitek says the design can withstand up to 8,100 pascals (Pa) of snow load and up to 3,600 Pa of wind load. It also features a split junction box with an IP68 enclosure. The maximum system voltage is 1,000 V.
The product comes with 30-year product and efficiency warranties. The company said the panel will offer 90% of the initial efficiency after 30 years, or 0.31% per annum after the first year's 1% reduction.
Solitek said the module is already making its way into new PV plants, such as an alpine retaining wall project that Switzerland's Engadiner Kraftwerke completed in December. A similar Swiss plant was also commissioned in December, featuring mounting equipment from K2 Systems and solar modules from an undisclosed supplier in the Swiss canton of Appenzell Ausserhoden.

3,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/30/improving-performance-of-thermoelectric-generators-with-pvt-energy-nanofluids/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-01-30,"Thermoelectric generators with PVT energy, nanofluids","An international research team led by Australia's RMIT University has fabricated a prototype of a nanofluid-cooled thermoelectric generator (TEG) that uses photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) energy to increase its overall efficiency.
TEGs can convert heat into electricity through the “Seebeck effect,” which occurs when a temperature difference between two different semiconductors produces a voltage difference between two substances. The devices are commonly used for industrial applications to convert excess heat into electricity. However, their high costs and limited performance have thus far limited their adoption on a broader scale.
The research group described the proposed PVT-TEG-NF system as a hybrid system featuring a 10 W polycrystalline solar module, 16 TEGs, and eight aluminum heat exchangers connected in parallel and attached to the system's backside. The researchers said that this configuration ensures an almost uniform temperature gradient across all TEGs, while mitigating heat loss to the environment by insulating the back of the panel, allowing the heat to be captured solely through the heat exchangers.
“By increasing solar concentration from 1.5 suns to 2.5 suns, the PV temperatures could be maintained at 44.5 C and 51.5 C using CuO-Fe/W and water with 0.12 m/s of inlet velocity, respectively,” they explained. “This made it possible to enhance the power output of the PV and TEGs by 65.9 % and 187 %, respectively, by using CuO-Fe/W as coolant, while the temperature of the panel could be maintained at a safe level.”
The researchers described the system in “A nanofluid-based hybrid photovoltaic-thermal -thermoelectric generator system for combined heat and power applications,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management.
“It is evident that for concentrations of lower than 2 suns, the system using CuO-Fe/W performs the best and can keep the PV and overall efficiency high,” they concluded.
The research team included scientists from the K. N. Toosi University of Technology in Iran.

UK-based developer Elements Green, which has a 7 GW greenfield pipeline of renewable energy projects throughout the world, is launching the Great North Road Solar Park project.
Subject to approval, the project will have a potential generating capacity of around 800 MW (AC) of solar power. Elements Greens said it will have the potential to meet the power needs of around 400,000 homes, which is equivalent to the number of homes in Nottinghamshire.
The project site spans approximately 2,900 hectares of agricultural land. The PV part of the development is currently 1,600 hectares, with the remaining area designated for cables and access roads.
A spokesperson for the project’s design team told pv magazine that the land in question is owned by numerous private landowners. However, the person said that the land acquisition process will be completed shortly. They added that it is too early in the process to know how the Great North Road Solar Park will sell its energy, but all options remain open.
The first stage of the consultation – a six-week long window with opportunities for feedback from the local community and stakeholders at online and in-person events – is currently ongoing and will end on Feb. 27. 
Mark Noone, project director for Great North Road Solar Park, said the plans for the park align with the British Energy Security Strategy, which aims to increase the United Kingdom's solar capacity fivefold by 2035. 
“With an installed capacity of over one gigawatt (GW) DC, GNR Solar Park would contribute 1.5% towards this target,” said Noone. “We want to deliver this project responsibly and are committed to consulting as widely and efficiently as possible, working together with residents, businesses and community organisations to improve and enhance our proposals as our plans for the project progress.”
Due to its proposed generation capacity, the Great North Road Solar Park is classified as a “Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project.” Elements Green plans to submit a development consent order application to the UK Secretary of State for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero in spring 2025.

One was ambitious but within the realm of possibility. The other pledge was plain wishful thinking. The first, signed by 123 countries, was enshrined in the final COP28 document. The second was unofficial and attracted only 25 countries. One concerned renewable energy and energy efficiency, the other, nuclear energy. No prizes for guessing which pledge corresponded to which energy source.

Historical trends can help us understand why a goal of tripling nuclear energy generation capacity by 2050 is unattainable. According to the latest edition of the “World Nuclear Industry Status Report (WNISR2023),” the operating power generating capacity of all nuclear plants in the world is 365 GW, as of July 2023. Tripling this by mid century, 27 years from now, would mean close to 1.1 TW of nuclear capacity.
Twenty-seven years ago, in 1996, the world had 344 GW of nuclear generation capacity. Since then, when the capacity added by new nuclear reactors is tallied and that of old reactors that have been shut down is subtracted, the global nuclear fleet has grown an average of 800 MW per year. At that rate, nuclear capacity in 2050 would be a mere 386 GW, assuming that a large number of reactors would be built to replace the aging nuclear fleets of most countries. In other words, the likely nuclear capacity in 2050 would be a mere fraction of what is desired by the COP28 pledge.
A second trend should also be acknowledged. Since 1996, the share of global electricity produced by nuclear reactors has declined from 17.5% to 9.2%, according to “WNISR2023.” That is in stark contrast to the corresponding trends for renewables, especially solar and wind energy. Between 1996 and 2023, the share of global electricity produced by modern renewable forms of energy has grown from 1.2% to 14.4%, according to the Energy Institute’s “2023 Statistical Review of World Energy.” The actual increase in the amount of energy produced by renewable sources is even more dramatic because the total energy flowing in the world’s electricity grids has more than doubled over that period.
The phenomenal growth of renewables is fueled by an even more astonishing decline in the cost of generating solar and wind power. Between 2009 and 2023, the levelized cost of generating electricity from utility scale photovoltaic farms and onshore wind farms in the United States has decreased by 83% and 63%, respectively, according to the “2023 Levelized Cost of Energy+” report published by Lazard. Nuclear electricity costs have escalated by 47% over the same period.
For recently constructed reactors, each gigawatt of generation capacity costs around $15 billion, meaning a bill of around $11 trillion to build the 730 GW needed to triple current capacity. The cost would be even more when taking into account the need to replace some of the old reactors shut down over the same period.
Nuclear advocates would likely disagree with this analysis and these numbers, arguing that building lots of reactors would lower the cost per gigawatt of generation capacity because of learning from experience. On the contrary, the cost of building nuclear plants has typically gone up as more have been built. In the United States and France, the countries with historically the largest nuclear fleets, and reliable costing information, the most recent reactors, Vogtle-3 and -4 in the US state of Georgia, and Flamanville-3, in Normandy, are the most expensive ones built in those countries.
Some nuclear proponents argue that small modular reactors (SMRs) will change this picture. These will not benefit from economies of scale, however. A reactor that generates three times as much power as an SMR will not require three times as much concrete or three times as many workers. As a result, building and operating SMRs will cost more than large reactors for each megawatt of generation capacity. In turn, the electricity from small reactors will be more expensive than electricity from bigger sites, as was seen in the case of the many small reactors built in the United States before 1975. Those were financially uncompetitive and shut down early.
The higher cost per unit of generating capacity was also seen in the case of the proposed NuScale reactor, which was planned for Utah, in the United States. The now abandoned project, which was to be developed by NuScale for electric utility Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems, would have involved six SMRs with a total generation capacity of 462 MW for an eye-popping $9.3 billion. At that rate, building a gigawatt of nuclear capacity would cost $20 billion, not $15 billion.
That cost would likely have been greater if the project had actually gone ahead and the reactor was built. Historically, nuclear reactors have routinely exceeded initial cost estimates, with one paper, published in scientific journal “Energy,” finding 175 of 180 nuclear construction projects had experienced cost increases and delays. The authors of that 2014 paper found cost escalations averaged 117% and construction took 64% longer, on average, than projected. The cost of the Vogtle project rose from an estimate of $14 billion, when construction of the two AP1000 reactors started – according to news service CNN Money – to more than $35 billion, reported website Energy Intelligence.

6,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/30/delayed-eu-heat-pump-plan-puts-eur-7-billion-at-risk-warn-61-industry-chiefs/,"FINANCE,HEAT PUMPS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,EUROPE",MARIJA MAISCH,2024-01-30,"Delayed EU heat pump plan puts EUR 7 billion at risk, warn 61 industry chiefs","The European heat pump sector has once again urged the European Commission against delaying the EU Heat Pump Action Plan as sales continue to slump.
On Tuesday, 61 CEOs said in a joint letter to European Commission President von der Leyen that this threatens EUR 7 billion ($7.6 billion) of planned investments in the sector over the 2022-25 period.
“This would affect jobs in the sector; there are over 160,000 already today in Europe, and huge growth possibilities,” the industry leaders said in the letter.
The European Commission has recognized the heat pump sector as critical for Europe’s energy independence under REPowerEU and the Green Deal Industrial Plan. However, it said in December that it was postponing the EU Heat Pump Action Plan – which would set out how it planned to achieve its pledge to install 10 million additional heat pumps by 2027 – until after the European Parliament elections in June.
An email sent from the commission to the Brussels-based European Heap Pump Association (EHPA) in December stated that the action plan would not be released in the “very busy Q1 2024,” but most likely in the”autumn or winter 2024-25.”
The latest figures show heat pump sales dropping at the end of 2023. According to the EHPA, this is due to policy changes that have shaken consumer and manufacturer confidence, alongside falling gas prices, which make heat pumps less financially attractive.
The EHPA’s figures show that a good first quarter last year was followed by declining sales of space and hot water pumps in the second and third quarters. On average in the 10 countries analyzed, sales fell 14% year on year in the third quarter of 2023, the association said.
“Instead of double-digit growth for 2023 the sector is experiencing a double-digit decline in the last quarter of 2023 compared to 2022,” said the 61 executives in the letter. “This decline has come about because gas prices have fallen while electricity prices remain high and there are still tax breaks on fossil fuels and on boilers running solely on fossil fuels. In many countries, the energy transition in heating has been made into a political issue – as a result, ambitions have been lowered and end-users become uncertain and prefer to stick to the status quo.”
The Heat Pump Action Plan – a four-pronged policy aiming to accelerate heat pump deployment and support the market – has been in the works since April. It followed the publication of the 2022 European Commission report on the competitiveness of clean energy technologies, which indicated that “the deployment of all kinds of heat pumps (from single-family houses to large multi-apartment, tertiary buildings and heat network heat pumps to high-temperature heat pumps for industrial applications) is necessary to meet our reinforced climate objectives.”
“Without a dedicated EU action plan, 22 million old individual heating appliances and several thousand large old fossil-based heating units are at risk of being replaced by fossil boilers,” the commission said at the time.
According to Eurostat data, about 50% of all energy consumed in the European Commission is used for heating and cooling, and more than 70% still comes from fossil fuels (mostly natural gas). In the residential sector, around 80% of the final energy consumption is used for space and water heating.
Martin Forsén, the president of the EHPA, argues that Europeans will reap the benefits of a strong heat pump market, from industrial leadership and jobs to decarbonization and protection from volatile gas prices.
“The European Commission’s decision to slam on the brakes on its Action Plan – just as other world regions accelerate their support – is the exact opposite of what’s needed. Today industry leaders call for swift publication of the Plan, to put Europe on track for energy independence and net-zero competitiveness,” he said.
The letter to the European Commission published on Tuesday follows another letter last week that was signed by 19 organizations and NGOs, calling for the Heat Pump Action Plan to be quickly published.

EnergyBin runs a business-to-business solar equipment commerce platform, selling secondary-market components for goods that are not sold via primary distribution channels. In its latest report, “PV Module Price Index for the Secondary Market”, it noted an increase in secondary market volume, and an industry-wide decrease in module prices. 
“Half-way through 2023, we began to see prices drop as the market sought to correct itself,” said Renee Kuehl, chief operations officer of EnergyBin. “Yet, we expect prices to continue to fluctuate as supply ebbs and flows. Therefore, it’s more imperative than ever to keep a watchful eye on prices.” 
The most recent report shows data for module spot prices transacted in December 2023. Secondary market modules traded on EnergyBin traded at $0.261/W for all black modules, high-efficiency modules fetched a price of $0.376/W, mainstream modules $0.246/W, low-cost modules $0.199/W, and used modules averaged $0.095/W.
The February edition of pv magazine, out next week, considers the ramifications of Dubai’s COP28 climate change summit for solar and asks where the workers will come from to staff the energy transition. A busy edition also ranges as far afield as Bulgaria, the South Caucasus, Cyprus, South Africa, Poland, and Navajo Nation in search of solar updates.
Mainstream modules are defined as standard modules with efficiencies between 19% and 21% and typically built with mono p-type or n-type PERC, HJT, or TOPCon cells. This category of modules has decreased in price 38.5% year-over-year since December 2022. More than 80% of the modules traded on EnergyBin in 2023 had efficiencies of 19% or greater. “Low-cost” modules are legacy or lower wattage modules in new condition with efficiencies at or below, and these modules have decreased 44.1% year on year.

They presented their findings in “Optimization of the solar energy storage capacity for a monitoring UAV,” which was recently published in Sustainable Futures.
“One of the main contributions of this article is the increase in the autonomy of the designed UAV by incorporating a photovoltaic solar energy backup system,” they said. “The optimization of the storage system is carried out based on an objective function, in which the battery capacity is minimized to increase flight autonomy since it has a direct relationship with the weight of the aircraft.”
The research group first conducted an aerodynamic study and wind flow simulation. Using a set of equations and simulation programs, the scientists proposed a UAV with a wing surface of 8347.50 cm2 and a wingspan of 342 cm. The proposed length of the fuselage was 97.6 cm.
The UAV was assumed to have a few telemetry systems, a camera, and a transmitter. It also included a propulsion system, servo motors, and a battery. The total weight of the proposed UAV, including the surveillance components and the aircraft itself,  was 3.5 kg.
Based on those parameters, a digital 3D design of the aircraft was done using AutoCAD software and then imported to MatLab. The latter enabled the scientists to simulate the UAV in different flight paths under standard solar radiation over Ambato, Ecuador.
“A renewable system consisting of 48 photovoltaic cells that will be located along the fixed wing of the UAV,” the academics said, noting that they used C60 monocrystalline cells. “In addition, due to the geometry of the aircraft, the cells must be connected in series, thus reaching a power of 178.56 W.”
Through an optimization algorithm, the group calculated the required power supply and storage capacity and considered costs, voltage, and battery weight, as well as the capacity, surface, and efficiency of the PV unit, along with the dimensions and operational needs of the UAV.
“To optimize the system we worked with the pymo library of python, with which we determined an optimal capacity of 15 mAh,” the researchers said. “Once the battery capacity has been estimated, a Lithium Ion arrangement is integrated. The battery module is integrated by six batteries of the Li-Ion-18650 series; each battery provides a voltage of 3.7 Vdc with a capacity of 2200 mAh … By implementing this optimization technique, the system’s autonomy capacity can be increased by up to four times.”
The research group included researchers from Spain’s Autonomous University of Madrid, Ecuador’s Polytechnic School of Chimborazo, and the Technical University of Ambato.

They quantified the precise amount of dust density on the panels and analyzed the composition and particle size.
The scientists created one setup on the rooftop of a building in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, and another one in the southern city of Bahawalpur.
“Islamabad’s climate is clean, pleasant and warm with an average annual temperature of 20.3 C. Even the driest month contains much rainfall, which contributes to cleaning PV modules,” they said. “Bahawalpur is located in a desert region with a dry climate with virtually no rainfall but with frequent wind and dust storms with an average annual temperature of 26.1 C.”
The setups consisted of 40 W polycrystalline modules and reference panels that were kept constantly clean. All modules were mounted on south-facing metal stands with fixed tilt angles of 34 degrees.
The research group collected global solar radiation data as well as the voltage and current of each module. They adjusted glass sheets to the PV modules to collect dust and analyze its properties.
“After six weeks of atmospheric exposure, dusty modules displayed significantly smaller efficiency as a function of different dust densities in the two regions,” they noted.
The total dust accumulated in Islamabad was 6.388 g/m2, with a daily average of 0.152 g/m2. In Bahawalpur, total dust accumulation was 10.254 g/m2 and the daily average was 0.244 g/m2. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that in both cities the particles had distinct sizes, unsymmetrical shapes, and uneven arrangement.
“In the dust sample collected from Islamabad, carbon dominates with 55.8% composition followed by oxygen, silicon and calcium with 22.71%, 9.78% and 3.85% composition respectively. Aluminum, iron, potassium, magnesium, and sodium are also found in significantly fewer quantities,” the group said. “In the dust sample collected from Bahawalpur oxygen leads to a 46.9% composition followed by carbon, silicon and aluminum with compositions of 20.11%, 16.98% and 4.26% respectively.”
Comparing the dirty and clean modules in each city, the researchers detected a reduction in output power of 15.08% in Islamabad and a 25.42% reduction in output power in Bahawalpur.
The researchers concluded that the reduced output was attributable not only to the fact that dust reduces sunlight absorption via the so-called shielding effect but also to the dust-temperature phenomenon. The latter occurs because the dust on the PV module causes a change in the form of heat transfer and leads to the formation of hotspots.
They presented their findings in “Effect of dust accumulation on the performance of photovoltaic modules for different climate regions,” which was recently published in Heliyon. The team included academics from Pakistan’s National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) and the Islamic University of Bahawalpur, as well as the United Kingdom’s University of Warwick.

Munich-based Wacker Chemie recorded a significant year-on-year decline in sales and earnings in 2023 due to the weak market environment.
According to the group's preliminary figures, sales fell by 22% year on year to €6.4 billion, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) dropped by 60% to €824 million.
“The global industrial engine began to stutter in 2023 and many companies felt the impact, as did we at Wacker,” said CEO Christian Hartel. “Price pressure was high, and the recovery in customer demand that was hoped for at the beginning of the year did not materialize. Persistently high energy prices in Germany further impacted our business. As a result, we could not post sales and earnings similar to the record figures Wacker achieved in 2022.”
Wacker said earnings before interest and taxes fell from €1.68 billion in the previous year to around €405 million, while net profit for the year fell from €1.28 billion to around €330 million.
“As great as the current challenges may be, we will continue to benefit from global megatrends in the medium and long term,” said Hartel. “Digitalization, renewable energies, electromobility and energy conservation are among the key drivers of our business. Strategically, we are well positioned.”
