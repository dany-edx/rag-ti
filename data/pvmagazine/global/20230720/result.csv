Fifty-five members of parliament in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) have supported the EU electricity market reforms, while 15 voted against them and two have abstained.
The Energy Committee of the European Parliament has instructed the EU Commission to set up a marketplace for PPAs by the end of 2024. They also spoke out in favor of allowing “non-fossil flexibility” for the stabilization of the electricity grids, as well as flexibility on the demand side from, for example, residential storage systems linked to PV. This can help balance the electricity grid, reduce price volatility and enable consumers to adjust their energy consumption in line with prices and their needs.
“This vote sends a powerful signal to the EU capitals, as the Energy Council works to agree its own position,” said Naomi Chevillard, head of regulatory affairs at SolarPower Europe. “EU institutions must now complete negotiations to ensure a fast adoption of the text, which also contains positive proposals for the growth of PPAs, rooftop PV and grid integration of solar.’‘
The RE-Source platform said that the agreement encourages more investment in renewable energy and reinforces the importance of renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs) as a significant tool for funding the energy transition in Europe.
“The council now needs to align on their own position, likely after the summer break,” it said. “This will be followed by … negotiations involving the council, European Parliament and European Commission. The EU aims to agree on the framework by the end of 2023.”

NamPower is seeking EPC contractors for the project. Interested developers have until Aug. 18 to submit their proposals.
The project was originally designed for wind generation, with a planned capacity of 40 MW. Local media outlets reported that the wind project was scrapped due to lower-than-expected wind resources at the Rosh Pinah site.
NamPower aims to install 220 MW of renewables capacity, including 110 MW of solar.
Namibia had around 176 MW of installed solar capacity at the end of 2020, according to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency.

The facility is the fourth PV project built by the French company in the area. In 2018, it also completed the Pduyim (14 MW), Mefalsim (13 MW), and Kfar Maimon (7 MW) solar projects, which the Israeli authorities selected in a tender in 2017.
The new solar plant in Ashalim will sell power to the grid at a tariff of ILS 0.08 ($0.0223)/kWh, which the government said is the cheapest price paid for energy and solar power in Israel to date.
According to the Israeli government, Ashalim currently hosts 312 MW of operational solar capacity. In May 2023, the Israel Land Authority launched a tender to lease 28,000 acres (11,331 hectares) in the Negev Desert for the deployment of large-scale solar power plants.
The country mainly has PV at its disposal to increase its generation capacity, with around 5 GW already installed. The renewables target is 20% of generation by 2025 and 30% by 2030.

The aim of their work was to compare the performance of the system with that of non-cooled PV systems or systems cooled with water under hot climate conditions.
“Experiments were conducted in May 2022 on sunny days from 7:00 am to 5:00 pm, with no significant variation in the ambient temperature and solar radiation during the experiment days,” the researchers said. “The maximum ambient temperature was 42.7 C, specifically at 12:20 pm, then gradually lowered until sunset.”
The experimental setting was located in Basra city, in the south of Iraq. It consisted of a PVT module cooled by ZrO2, a PV module cooled with water, and a PV module without cooling, with all the modules having a nominal power of 50 W. The PVT module uses an absorber copper plate with flow channels attached to the backside, which reduces the module temperature.
The group also applied a layer of thermal wool on the serpentine tubes to completely cover the PV module’s backside and reduce heat losses, then covered it with an aluminum plate. The ZrO2 nanofluid is circulated in the serpentine tubes by two pumps with a mass flow rate of 0.7 L/min set by flow sensors.
The scientists applied three different concentrations of ZrO2 of 0.015%, 0.025%, and 0.0275% in the PVT system, which they said led to temperature reductions of 14%, 18.1%, and 21.2%, respectively, compared to the reference PV panel without cooling. The operating temperature of the module cooled with water was reduced by 9.7%.
They presented the system in the study “Effect of zirconium oxide nanofluid on the behaviour of photovoltaic–thermal system: An experimental study,” published in Energy Reports. “The current study can be extended by improving the thermal properties of ZrO nanofluid through adding another type of nanomaterials to form a hybrid nanofluid, applied for a new cooling system design,” they stated.

The company said it will build a 525 kV high-voltage direct current (HVDC) cable that will initially connect Greece and Cyprus. It will be installed at depths of more than 3,000 meters.
“Subsea HVDC Mass Impregnated cables will be manufactured in Nexans' facilities in Halden (Norway) and Futtsu (Japan), and will be installed by the state-of-the-art cable laying vessels Nexans Aurora and Nexans Skagerrak,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The Pole One cable is expected to be completed in 2028, while the remaining portion of the project, connecting Israel with Cyprus and Greece, will be finalized in 2029.
“The EuroAsia Interconnector will exchange up to 1,000 MW among the three nations with the capability of increasing to 2,000 MW,” Nexas said, referring to the whole project.
The energy ministers of Greece, Cyprus and Israel signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2021 to improve the implementation of subsea electricity infrastructure. The EuroAsia Interconnector was listed as one of the European Union’s Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) selected by the European Commission to step up the bloc’s internal energy market in 2015.
In July of this year, the Israeli government launched a project to build a submarine cable along its national coastline. The government noted the possibility of connecting the new cable to a submarine transmission line planned by Israel, Greece and Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea.

Brisbane-based Evos said the Australian-made SB7 charger is compatible with all EVs. It has been designed to help homeowners to charge their vehicles safely and conveniently, while also empowering them to make smart energy decisions.
Evos Chief Executive Officer Marcelo Salgado said the SB7 charger would connect to an app that allows drivers to monitor the cost of charging and features a built-in energy management system that can be programmed to charge EVs during off-peak periods or to leverage solar or battery power. The charger is also Wi-Fi connection capable, ensuring Evos and/or the homeowner can monitor and control the charger.
“We asked ourselves what the EV owner needs from a charger,” Salgado said. “It has to be easy to install with no restrictions as to where it can go on a property, be easy to monitor remotely and help them manage their costs in an era when everyone is concerned with energy prices. And it has to look good.”
The SB7, which will be manufactured in Australia, is the first Evos equipment designed for residential applications after the company released a 22 kW charger for business fleets in 2021. The charger is expected to be available between September and October, although its price had yet to be determined.
The SB7 charger and the Fleet Home22 Charger will be sold through Ampol. Ampol Energy General Manager James Myatt said the company became “acutely aware” that its customer’s needs were changing, so it moved into electricity distribution last year. Myatt said the deal with Evos would help meet the needs of customers who plan to power up their vehicles outside service stations in future.
“The technology allows us to support customers wherever their journey is, whether they’re starting their journey at home, on the road, wherever they park their cars, or on the way home from work,” he said. “If people are going to need charging at home, we want to provide the infrastructure to do that.”
Ampol said it will sell EV equipment directly to consumers and potentially through partners such as automotive brand BYD. It is also investing in public charging points at its petrol stations and intends to install 300 charging bays by 2024.
The launch of the SB7 EV charger comes after Evos earlier this month announced it had completed a funding round, securing AUD 5 million ($3.41 million) from existing investors to help commercialiZe its charging and energy management software technology. The capital raise came after the company initially raised AUD 1.7 million in 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/20/australian-team-claims-99-recovery-rate-with-solar-recycling-process/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 20, 2023",Australian team claims 99% recovery rate with solar recycling process,"From pv magazine Australia
The patented process includes the use of stainless steels balls as a high-abrasion sieving aid, with the UNSW team saying that in tests they have been able to extract 99% of the components, including silver, from solar cellw for potential reuse.
Recycling end-of-life solar panels thoroughly continues to be a challenge with the individual materials, including glass, silicon, precious metals, wiring and plastic, integrated in such a way that makes them hard to separate. For the process to be viable, components need to be carefully separated to avoid contamination, but that has been hard to achieve.
But now a team from the UNSW Process Modelling and Optimisation of Reacting Flow (ProMO) lab, led by Professor Yansong Shen, has developed a new process that allows them to quickly and efficiently sort the individual materials. The process integrates conventional methods for the separation of large components, such as the aluminum frame and glass sheets, and crushing of the cell, but relies on a very highly abrasive separation system to improve the process.
“The key to our new process is the addition of the sieving aids which help to crush the solar cells into smaller particles allowing a better separation of all the components,” Shen said. “That makes it much easier to recover important elements such as the silver contained in the solar cells.”
The ProMO research team discovered that using stainless steels balls as a sieving aid provided the optimal solution for the process.
“We spent around three or four months working on that element, also testing with sieving aids made of clay or plastic,” team member Chengsun He said. “We can use different size sieving aids for different stages of the process. The main goal is to ensure that all of the PV cells particles can be crushed by the sieving aids, while the glass and other significant material remains intact at the top.”
The entire crushing and sieving process, which occurs inside a vibrating container, takes about five to 15 minutes to effectively separate 99% of the materials.
Once the material has been separated using the new patented process, the team is able to employ a traditional chemical leaching, as well as precipitation to extract the specific elements such as pure silica and silver, which accounts for about 0.05% of the total weight of a panel but makes up approximately 14% of the material value.
Shen said the team is already working with some industry partners “but we would like to engage in more industry collaborations to scale this process up and enhance the economic feasibility of the PV recycling process … Our group of 30 researchers is the largest in Australia working on PV recycling technology development, not lifecycle assessment only, and probably one of the largest in the world. This patent is just one part of one recycling process for end-of-life solar panels and we are also working on other solutions to the other steps.”
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) says that cumulative PV waste volume on a global scale will reach up to 8 million tons by 2030. That figure soars to up to 78 million tons of waste by 2050 as successive generations of solar panels installed at the start of the century come to their end of life, according to IRENA.

Ambri, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) spinoff, has developed a liquid metal battery for long-duration energy storage solutions. Designed for daily cycling in harsh environments, the battery has an expected lifetime of 20-plus years with minimal fade, said Ambri. While the battery is now in use in data centers, an announced test with Xcel Energy is the first reported installation by a utility.
Xcel Energy and Ambri plan a year-long test the 300 kWh system at Solar Technology Acceleration Center (SolarTAC) in Aurora, Colorado. SolarTAC is owned and managed by Grey Snow Management Solutions, a tribally owned economic development enterprise. The test center was established in 2009 by original founding member companies Xcel Energy, SunEdison and Abengoa Solar with the mission to test renewable energy technologies in a real-world, grid-connected environments.
Installation of the Xcel system is expected to begin in early 2024, with the system fully operational later in the year. The pilot will test various use cases, including solar and wind integration, capacity management, arbitrage, and ancillary services, among others. It will use the GridNXT Microgrid Platform at SolarTAC to integrate multiple generation sources, such as solar and wind, along with inverters, load banks, and three-phase distribution connections and communications.
Xcel Energy became the first utility in the United States to set a long-term goal of providing its customers zero-carbon electricity. The utility aims to be net-zero across electricity, heating, and transportation by 2050.
“Xcel Energy is a forward-thinking and ambitious utility, and their enthusiasm for testing our system highlights the huge potential for Liquid Metal batteries,” said Adam Briggs, chief commercial officer at Ambri. “Xcel Energy clearly understands the significant value that can be achieved by integrating innovative storage technologies into their renewable portfolio.”
Xcel Energy plans to develop a follow-on memorandum of understanding (MOU) for larger-capacity long-duration energy storage projects to follow the upcoming 300kWh system at SolarTAC.
“Xcel Energy has always been at the forefront among utilities in the transition to carbon-free electricity,” said Justin Tomljanovic, vice president of corporate development at Xcel Energy. “This demonstration project with Ambri allows us to explore a technology that could help us continue to reliably supply the energy our customers depend on throughout the clean energy transition.”
Ambri’s batteries, manufactured in Milford, Massachusetts, feature a liquid calcium alloy anode, a molten salt electrolyte, and a cathode comprised of solid particles of antimony, enabling the use of low-cost materials and a low number of steps in the cell assembly process.
The company said that the active materials in its cells reversibly alloy and de-alloy while charging and discharging. The electrolyte thermodynamically stable with the electrodes, avoiding side reactions such as film-formation that can lead to performance degradation. The negative electrode is fully consumed when discharged, and reformed on every cycle, resulting in what the company said is a “highly repeatable process with no memory effect.”

Bi2S3 is a promising candidate for the photovoltaic community owing to the earth-abundant and environmentally friendly constituent elements alongside appropriate optoelectronic properties, such as a desirable band gap of around 1.2 eV, a large absorption coefficient of around 105 cm–1, and long-term stability.
“In our work, for the first time, a proof of concept solar cell with CSS Bi2S3 was demonstrated and an in-depth analysis of the interrelation between grain structure, interface recombination, and device performance was provided,” the research's lead author, Mykhailo Koltsov, told pv magazine. “Employing low-temperature dependence photoluminescence (PL), we provided in premiere new and complementary insights on possible defects and recombination mechanisms in green and earth-abundant Bi2S3 PV material.”
The scientists initially developed several Bi2S3 absorber films deposited on various substrates. Via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) they then investigated their properties and morphology, in order to identify those with optimal growth.
With the best Bi2S3 absorber film, the scientists built a cell based on a substrate made of glass and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), electron transport layer (ETL) using either a titanium oxide (TiO2), the Bi2S3 absorber itself, and gold (Au) metal contacts. The Bi2S3 absorber was deposited at 450 C. They also constructed a similar device relying on an ETL based on cadmium sulfide (CdS).
The first cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 0.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 10 mV, a short-circuit current of 3.5 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 23.0. The second device reached an efficiency of 0.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 190 mV, a short-circuit current of 4.6 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 32.0.
“For both device configurations, processed with Bi2S3 at CSS substrate temperatures below 400 ◦C, the efficiencies tend to be zero,” the researchers stated. “The source temperature of 550 C and substrate temperature of 400–450 C were identified as optimal temperatures which allowed a reasonable deposition rate and fabrication of uniform Bi2S3 films.”
According to Koltsov, the development of Bi2S3 PV technology would mean lower processing temperatures and reduced time compared to state-of-the-art thin-film industrial technologies, particularly the use of thinner absorbers deposited using single-step processes.
“This delivers a relevant reduction in the power requirements for fabrication, ensuring a lower CO2 footprint and environmental impact,” he went on to say. “Environmental impact is also reduced by the absence of toxic or hazardous materials in the fabrication process.”
The potential for reduction of power production costs can be understood by consideration of compatibility with established thin-film CdTe technology. Existing infrastructure could be utilized to reduce the CdTe module cost per watt for equivalent efficiency.
“Cadmium and telluride currently cost around $3.3/kg and $70/kg, respectively,” he said. “Bismuth and sulfur – the two compounds forming Bi2S3 P – currently costs $8.6/kg and up to 0.5/kg, respectively. Furthermore, the Bi2S3 absorber is less than 1μm thick while CdTe absorber have usually thickness of 2μm.”
Koltsov believes the Bi2S3  technology has the potential for reduction of PV electricity price, targeting production costs of less than €0.20 ($0.224)/W.

According to IREC's 13th annual “National Solar Jobs Census,” full-time jobs in the US solar and energy storage industries grew in 2022, and demand will only increase in the future.
The new report shows that the solar energy workforce grew by 3.5% in 2022, with a total of 263,883 solar workers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, up by 8,846 jobs since 2021. Energy storage jobs grew 4.6% over 2021.
“The solar industry has grown by leaps and bounds over the past decade, overcoming one challenge after the next to provide a quarter million jobs for Americans of all educational levels and backgrounds,” said Larry Sherwood, president and CEO of IREC. “With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we can look forward to transformational jobs growth in solar, batteries, and other clean energy industries in the years ahead.”
About two-thirds of the US solar jobs are at installation and project development firms. The strongest growth sector was the residential market, which grew 11% or by about 9,500 jobs. The utility-scale market contracted by about 6,000 jobs in 2022, which was a challenging year due to the threat of solar tariffs and supply chain concerns.
About 33,400 jobs were in manufacturing associated with solar, and that sector is expected to grow as manufacturers of modules, cells and wafers open factories in the United States to take advantage of the production tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

California leads the way, with a total of 2,404 solar jobs added in 2022, followed by New York (988 jobs), Texas (904 jobs), Florida (506 jobs) and Massachusetts (476 jobs). The top US state for energy storage jobs was also California, with a total of 17,580 positions.

The hundreds of minigrids fed by diesel gen sets operated by independent power producers (IPPs) and public power utilities in the Amazon region all make use of government subsidies that cover 100% of the fuel costs. Quite often, more than a liter of diesel is consumed in transporting a liter of diesel to these remote and difficult-to-access areas. In 2023 alone, burning subsidized diesel in the Amazon minigrids will emit 1.6 MtCO2eq, with a fuel cost of $2.5 billion, which is shared by all Brazilians through the Fuel Consumption Account. The supply of electricity depends on the logistics of supplying diesel, which may be interrupted in times of drought, requiring that the diesel plants in certain locations have large fuel storage tanks. Furthermore, many locations with dirt road access suffer difficulties during the rainy season, requiring larger fuel stocks, as is the case of the town of Oiapoque shown below, which has a storage capacity of 1.5 million liters of fuel, with an autonomy of 45 days.
Over the last decades, attempts to reduce the participation of diesel generation in the riverside and isolated Amazon villages and towns have not been successful. IPPs prefer to stick to the diesel gensets they know so well, under the convenient shelter of the subsidies designed many decades ago to provide energy access, energy security, and reliability of service. In the meantime, many renewable energy technologies (RETs) have experienced price reductions and have established themselves in terms of reliability and the use of locally available natural resources. In this context, RETs such as biomass, solar and wind have been evaluated in order to assist in the Amazon Energy Transition, and a comprehensive analysis is presented here.
Image: ISES
Biomass: only a minority of the communities in isolated systems have sufficient capacity to generate energy using biomass production through the residues of the main crops in the region, including cassava, açaí, maize, banana, and sweet potato, among several others. Energy production through the burning of wood residues, obtained from sawmills that have a sustainable management plan and international certification of their product is something rare in the region, which is found in only one site (Itacoatiara – AM) operating in the Amazon (www.itacoatiara.com.br).
Wind: The Amazon region has a low average annual wind speed (less than 4 m/s), which, coupled with the difficult access and lack of scale in these isolated communities, render wind energy generation not competitive in the region.
Photovoltaics: The solar radiation resource is abundant and evenly spread all over the Amazon; the average annual global horizontal irradiation is over 1700 kWh/m2.year. Solar energy is a modular solution that is easy to install and low maintenance, but the technology has an important downside, which is the large area requirement. For the implementation of solar plants in the Amazon, three options are possible: i) centralized, ground-mounted PV plants, ii) floating solar PV plants, and iii) small distributed photovoltaic systems (rooftops or ground, including agrivoltaics).
Image: ISES
 
The large-area, centralized ground-mounted option runs into an important constraint, which is the availability of suitable areas for the installation of the area-intensive solar PV plants without further forest suppression. The Amazon rainforest is very dense with tall trees, and this is the main bottleneck of this technical solution, since for many locations there are no clear areas in this order of magnitude. Agrivoltaics can play an important role here, associating PV power production and sustainable land use.
Floating PV systems, which could be installed on the riverbanks close to which a good part of the isolated communities are located, are another option. Floating PV is widely used in places with high demographic density and low availability of land areas such as Singapore and Japan, and is typically installed on lakes or reservoirs, places of still water, with water movement only associated with the local wind. The technical viability of installing floating PV systems along the fast-current Amazon rivers is faced with great resistance and skepticism by the main and most experienced manufacturers of floating systems.
The third option for PV generation is the rooftop distributed solution that is so commonly deployed in urban areas, with more than 2 million installations operating in the Brazilian interconnected energy distribution system. Analyses carried out by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) show that the number of existing roofs in these isolated communities can guarantee a high percentage of service for these isolated systems. The option also presents important social aspects, because for PV integration in a large number of systems, a considerably large local labor force for installation and subsequent maintenance would be required.
The typical residential dwelling in these low-income communities uses low-cost fiber cement roof tiles, mounted on frail timber structures that cannot withstand the 20-25 kg/m2 additional load imposed by the typical PV module + aluminum structure used in rooftop PV. To enable rooftop PV integration under these conditions, fiber cement PV roof tiles have been developed by one of the largest fiber cement roof tile manufacturers in Brazil, and are at the final stages of endurance and reliability testing at the Solar Energy Laboratory at Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina. The additional weight of the stripes of 1/6 cut solar cells on the final roof tile is negligible, and the replacement of a number of these PV tiles on existing roofs is straightforward. Expected costs are below the traditional rooftop PV system, but scaling up is necessary in order to get access to PV cells at competitive costs.

In this assessment of scenarios for a sustainable and resilient energy transition in isolated systems in the Amazon, a portion of photovoltaic generators should be installed centrally in order to guarantee a central system of high performance, availability and reliability without clearing any further forest areas, while another significant portion of the generators should be installed distributed over rooftops and in agrivoltaic systems.

Researchers at Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE and the Materials Research Center FMF at the University of Freiburg have set a new world record for organic photovoltaics. They achieved an efficiency of 15.8% for a 1 cm2 organic solar cell by using an anti-reflection coating that absorbs more light in the photoactive layer of the cell and thus generates a higher current.
The thin-film system required for the coating was developed by the researchers at Fraunhofer ISE. The efficiencies of organic solar are still rather low compared to conventional crystalline silicon cells, although they can also be produced cheaply. Researchers around the world are still working on improving their efficiency and scalability.
“We achieved the improvement in the record-breaking solar cell to a large extent by using an anti-reflection coating, which absorbs more light in the photoactive layer of the cell and thus generates a higher current,” explained Uli Würfel, head of the organic and perovskite PV department at Fraunhofer ISE.
The thin-film system required for the coating was developed by the researchers at Fraunhofer ISE. At the same time, the research center also developed electrodes for semi-transparent organic solar cells using this coating process. These consist of a photoactive, organic layer applied to a back electrode that lets visible light through and at the same time reflects near-infrared light back into the cell, according to Würfel.
