These are renewable energy projects that failed to qualify for the expired feed-in tariff scheme and will now be allowed to sell power to Vietnamese utility EVN through power purchase agreements (PPAs).
EVN currently has a monopoly over the transmission, distribution, wholesale and retail of electricity, being the sole buyer in the Vietnamese market.
The MIOT reduced the ceiling price for ground-mounted solar projects from $0.0709/kWh to $0.0502/kWh, a 29% decrease. The ceiling price for onshore wind decreased by 21%, from $0.085/kWh to $0.0672/kWh.
“My interpretation would be that the low new ceiling is a way to kill off these projects as large solar capacity additions are unwanted at the moment,” Moritz Sticher, senior adviser at Berlin-based consulting firm Apricum, told pv magazine. “Given the high development and land costs, such tariffs make these projects financially unviable.”
According to a simulation model for a 100 MW ground-mounted solar plant, the new ceiling price would decrease the asset’s net present value (NPV) from $160 billion to $503 billion. The internal rate of return (IRR) would decrease from 10.7% to 6.2%. The data was modeled by Mai Nguyen, investment banking senior associate at Saigon Hanoi Securities (SHS).
Vietnam has long worked on a pilot scheme that would, for the first time, open its electricity market to bilateral PPAs. It was officially set to run between 2022 and 2024, with expectations now pointing to the first quarter of this year. There has been no official confirmation from the Vietnamese government thus far. According to Apricum’s latest data, the country has installed around 18.47 GW of solar capacity.

It says China installed a record 87.41 GW of solar in 2022.
Following an installation rush at the end of 2022, China installed 21.7 GW of new capacity in December alone, after adding 65.71 GW in the first 11 months of the year. The 87.41 GW in 2022 represent a year-on-year growth of 60.3% compared to 2021. NEA figures also show that by the end of 2022, China’s cumulative solar capacity reached 392.61 GW, up 28.1% year on year.
China also installed 37.63 GW of new wind power in 2022 – 21% less than in 2021. Wind and solar additions in 2022 exceeded 125 GW. NEA has set a 160 GW installation target for solar and wind in 2023.

The HEIV aims to reimburse up to 60% of the investment costs of installations meeting the conditions below:
In 2023, the planned HEIV fee per installed kilowatt is CHF 450 ($492). If the PV system is also entitled to a tilt angle bonus, this bonus will also be paid.

With the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the US government has thrown politics and business in the European Union into turmoil. A total of €340 billion ($369 billion) is available in the United States to support renewables, hydrogen, and other clean-tech industries. Those wishing to benefit from the subsidies and tax credits must either produce in the United States or use products that are manufactured there. This raises the concern that European companies might relocate some of their production operations to the other side of the Atlantic.
At the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that she will counter the IRA with a similar EU industrial plan. Specifically, Europe will relax rules for national funding and make aid more accessible. In addition, targeted subsidies will be used to set up production facilities for renewable technologies in strategic value chains, in order to counteract the risk of relocation through third-country subsidies – for example, to the United States.
However, some member states lack the financial resources to participate in the new plan, so additional EU funds will also be made available. Over the medium term, there should be a “European Sovereignty Fund” for such cases. Policymakers are currently analyzing how much money the EU is providing here. A first draft will likely be available by the end of the month.
“We only have a small window to invest in clean technology and innovation and to become leaders before the fossil fuel economy is over,” said von der Leyen.
In addition, the German politician also announced the removal of bureaucratic hurdles for photovoltaics and wind energy, heat pumps, energy storage, and electrolyzers.
“In particular, we will examine how the approval of new sites for clean technologies can be simplified and accelerated,” von der Leyen said. In addition, the EU Commission wants to present a “net-zero industry law” that sets clear targets for clean technologies in Europe by 2030.
“The International Energy Agency estimates that the market for mass-produced clean energy technologies will be worth around $650 billion per year in 2030 – more than three times what it is today,” explains von der Leyen. “To get ahead, we need to keep investing, strengthening our industrial base and making Europe more investment and innovation friendly.”
Dries Acke, policy director for SolarPower Europe, said that “the Green Deal Industrial Plan is a significant moment for European solar manufacturers. The EU is seriously acting on the concerns of the European solar sector over the last months and years.”
The association said it believes the plan will give European manufacturers the tools to become more competitive.
“President von der Leyen’s promise to temporarily simplify EU state aid rules, using straightforward tax-breaks, is critical. Solar manufacturers are facing energy prices two or three times higher than China and the US, and they are seeking relief quickly,” said Acke.

So much for the good news. Unfortunately, the IEA cannot substantiate its buoyant projection. Is the prediction credible, or is the continent at risk of becoming the world’s fossil fuel outlier?
Image: Empower New Energy
The global energy organization estimates Africa installed between 1.9 GW and 3.3 GW of solar last year, around 0.9% of a global figure estimated to have been between 210 GW and 240 GW. If true, that would represent a landmark year for Africa, but how reliable is the IEA estimate?
Trade body the Africa Solar Industry Association (AFSIA) estimates the 1.8 GW of solar added in the continent in 2019 fell to just 700 MW in 2021 with the latter number representing around 0.41% of the 168 GW installed worldwide two years ago. AFSIA expects Africa to have added 900 MW of solar last year, less than half the volume announced by the IEA and less than 0.4% of the global figure.
The EU, by comparison, is reported to have installed more than 41 GW of solar last year, almost 50 times more than AFSIA's Africa estimate.
These figures fall into an alarming wider pattern highlighted by Bloomberg New Energy in its “Scaling-Up Renewable Energy in Africa” report. While the world posted an all-time high $434 billion worth of renewables investment in 2021, Africa attracted no more than $2.6 billion – less than 0.6% of the total and slipping 35%, year on year, to the lowest level since 2011. Africa reportedly boasts around 60% of the world's solar resource – plus abundant hydro, wind, and bio energy potential – and 17% of the global population.
It can be uplifting to read the IEA's prediction Africa's solar fleet will expand 250% within five years, helped by the energy security fears and decarbonization objectives in big economies which are fueling the global clean energy boom. But the reality on the ground is that much needs to be done to attract the $4 billion to $5 billion needed annually to reach that milestone. If governments and other parties do not surmount the barriers deterring investors from the continent, Africa will continue to lag competition for solar investment from the US, Europe, China, and India, just as it did in the last two years.
A glance at the IEA statistics shows Egypt and South Africa host around 60% of Africa's solar generation capacity, thanks largely to the vast Benban Solar Park is Aswan, Egypt; and to South Africa's Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP).
Those two nations – plus Morocco, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia – will raise their current 5 GW of solar to 20 GW in 2027, according to the IEA, with 12 GW expected in Africa's other nations, which currently host only 1.5 GW between them.
Why it is so difficult to increase solar investment in Africa? There are three main obstacles: debt overhang, currency crises, and regulation.
Most of the utility scale solar and wind projects announced in Africa of late remain stalled, waiting for government-backed payment guarantees for the electricity to be generated. Investors and lenders request such assurance because Africa's utilities are wracked with debt but many governments are also in dire straits, ensuring payment guarantees cannot be issued.
The global recession expected as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic has been followed by soaring interest rates on the debt held by deeply leveraged governments; rising energy bills prompted by the war in Ukraine; and a dramatic fall in local currency values against the dollar. Yet again, Africa has been hardest hit. Public debt has doubled in the continent, from making up 32.7% of GDP in 2010 to 65% last year and the World Bank estimates most African nations will suffer a 30% to 40% increase in yearly debt servicing payments. World Bank president David Malpass said, “The increased liquidity pressures go hand in hand with solvency challenges.”
A sharp appreciation of the dollar against African currencies last year has left governments and private energy off-takers in an even worse position. For example, the Egyptian pound and the Ghanaian cedi depreciated around 70% against the dollar last year. In Nigeria, the cost of a dollar may officially be around 450 naira at the moment but the “real” price being paid is around 800 naira, up from 550 naira, or so, at the start of the year.
Richer nations can ride out currency wobbles by turning to local investors but Africa is dependent on foreign cash. International investors are interested only in dollar or euro revenue, otherwise the cost of capital will be prohibitive and unpredictable.
Commercial and industrial solar has the largest untapped potential for African PV but regulation and fossil fuel subsidies are holding it back. In the majority of African nations, businesses are not permitted to buy solar power from non-utility generators, through power purchase agreements, and must instead use less flexible contractual agreements such as equipment-lease terms.
The absence of net-metering arrangements, to pay solar power generators for excess electricity they inject into the grid, is another deterrent to PV investment.
With so many governments continuing to subsidize fossil fuels by providing artificially cheap electricity tariffs, there is another big disincentive to back solar. In Egypt, for instance, diesel costs around EGP 7.20 per liter ($0.24), around 20% of the price it commands in Europe.
Africa clearly has the potential for turbo-charged growth in renewables, as projected by the IEA, but if governments and international partners do not address the barriers holding back investment, the continent will continue to fall behind. This is a risk we cannot take if the world is to reach net zero.
So what needs to be done?
Energy reform, debt restructuring, and currency stability are clearly important but it is market-based price incentives for solar and batteries that could make a real difference. This could come in the form of a carbon tax, or tradeable carbon credits for clean power generators, and would help the business case of large energy users and microgrids which currently rely on diesel.
Further ahead, there is the option of carbon offsetting – whereby big polluters are able to offset their carbon footprint with payments to fund decentralized solar in Africa. That sort of measure could unlock a market for African green hydrogen to power microgrids and energy-intensive industry, alongside the use of fuel cells – and that could kick-start a clean-power fueled African economic revival.

They found that vaporization and thermodynamic changes represent two crucial factors in this process.
“Despite thermal insulation, the liquefied fuel in a cryotank experiences a degree of vaporization,” they explained, noting that high vaporization, measured as Boil-Off Gas (BOG), can result in excess internal pressure inside the tanks, leading to cracks and fissures.
“This makes understanding and controlling BOG a key factor in cryogenic tank design,” they said in “Experimental and numerical investigation of change in boil-off gas and thermodynamic characteristics according to filling ratio in a C-type cryogenic liquid fuel tank,” which was recently published in Energy.
The South Korean research team, led by Jong-Chun Park, looked at how BOG varies with the tank filling ratio (FR), which is the ratio of the mass of liquefied fuel in the tank to the capacity of the tank at 15 C. They also used liquefied nitrogen instead of hydrogen in the experiment to validate simulation results and reduce safety risks.
“It was observed that the amount of BOG tends to increase in the form of a quadratic function based on the trend line, as FR increases,” they said, noting that vaporization increases drastically as the tanks become emptier.
Cryogenic fuel tanks maintain temperatures below -253 C to transport hydrogen as a liquid, overcoming the poor safety and storage efficiency of the current hydrogen storage methods based on high-pressure gas. The energy to cool hydrogen to a cryogenic liquid state equates to about 35% of hydrogen’s total energy.
Two primary alternative storage methods are liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOCH) storage and conversion into ammonia. According to the researchers, the main advantage of these two methods is that the hydrogen can be stored at room temperature. The disadvantages are high energy requirements and difficulty using them for high-purity hydrogen.
The group explained that both techniques are in the early stages of development and are not ready for commercialization.

The new cell builds on another inverted perovskite solar cell fabricated with p-i-n structure, which was unveiled by the research group in September. This device, according to the scientists, was able to retain 87% of its original efficiency after 2,400 hours of operation at 55 C.
For the new cell, the group did not use an antisolvent to create a uniform perovskite film and used instead gas quenching, which consists of cooling the parts of a material down from critical temperature quickly in order to strengthen and harden. It is commonly used to maintain the properties associated with a crystalline structure or phase distribution.
“The result addressed the problem of the bromine and iodine separating, resulting in a perovskite film with improved structural and optoelectronic properties,” the scientists explained. “The gas-quenching process, when applied to high-bromine-content perovskite chemicals, forces the crystals to grow together, tightly packed from top to bottom, so they become like a single grain and significantly reduces the number of defects.”
Through this approach, the researchers were able to achieve a 20% efficiency for the wide-bandgap layer, which also showed operational stability, with less than 5% degradation over 1,100 hours.
When connected to a 1.25 eV narrow-bandgap bottom perovskite cell, the perovskite layer was able to bring the overall cell efficiency to 27.1% and its open-circuit voltage to 2.2 V.
“The gas-quench method is a general way for improving the performance of wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells,” said the scientists.
They presented the cell tech in “Compositional texture engineering for highly stable wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Science.
“The new growth approach demonstrated the potential of high-performance all-perovskite tandem devices and advanced the development of other perovskite-based tandem architectures such as those that incorporate silicon,” they concluded.

Denmark’s largest power provider and wind developer, Ørsted, said it will soon break ground on the 471 MW Mockingbird solar center. The project is Ørsted’s largest solar facility and ranks seventh among PV Intel’s largest projects to begin construction within the last year.
The facility is expected to produce enough electricity for 80,000 Texas homes, interconnecting with Texas utility Oncor. It will create at least 200 jobs during construction and will require long-term staffing for operations and maintenance. Project construction is slated for January 2023 and is expected to be completed in 2024.
The project will inject an estimated $215 million new revenue into the tax base, promoting local economic development in Lamar County, and providing long-term financial support for the North Lamar and Chisum Independent School Districts.
As part of the project, Ørsted said it is collaborating with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to protect nearly 1,000 acres of native tallgrass prairies in Texas. The company will purchase and transfer the land to TNC this year. Less than 1% of the original tallgrass prairies of Texas remain today, and less than 5% has survived nationwide.
The collaboration will mark the largest conservation of tallgrass prairies on record. The Mockingbird project will occupy 4,900 acres, which stretches into the Smiley-Woodfin Native prairie grassland, the largest contiguous remnant of a rare and threatened type of native prairie found in only a few counties in north Texas.
“We need to deliver green energy for this generation while protecting natural habitats for the next,” said Daniel Willard, biodiversity specialist for Ørsted. “Drawing on both internal expertise and outside guidance, we will continue to look for opportunities to protect the prairie and ensure that native plants and pollinators thrive.”
The transaction is part of the solar developer’s stated goal of being net-positive to biodiversity by 2030. Ørsted’s global biodiversity platform includes programs that range from regrowing coral and monitoring crustacean habitat, to seagrass restoration and oyster reintroduction.
Ørsted has a total US land-based capacity of 5 GW across wind, solar and storage resources. The company was the first to develop offshore wind in the United States, and has a 5 GW active offshore wind development pipeline.
No US state has more solar capacity on the way than Texas does in the coming years. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects as much as 36 GW of solar capacity to be added in the next five years, on top of the 16 GW installed thus far and leapfrogging the Lone Star State over California in terms of installed capacity.
To date, the state has enough solar capacity to power the equivalent of nearly 2 million homes. More than 10,000 Texans are employed by the solar industry, and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that over $19 billion has been invested in the technology through the third quarter of 2022. Nearly 5% of Texas electricity is generated by PV. Most of this capacity is being built at the utility scale, with a large band of projects occupying the drier, sunnier western half of the state.
