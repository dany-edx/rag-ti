Germany-based inverter manufacturer SMA Solar Technology AG was able to ship 6.8 GW of PV inverters in the first half of the year. This is slightly below the previous year's level of 7.1 GW and quarterly sales were correspondingly lower at €488 million. At the same time, SMA improved its EBIDTA from €24 million to €38.1 million and the EBIT from €2.7 million to €13.3 million year-on-year.
SMA board spokesman, Jürgen Reinert, said the positive performance is due to the “continuous improvement of the product mix and the cost structure”. In addition, orders for the commercial PV segment saw some recovery in the second quarter. “We are therefore expecting a positive development in sales and earnings for the second half of the year,” he said.
The SMA managing board also confirmed its sales and earnings forecast released in February. So, this year growth in sales up to €1,175 million and an EBITDA of up to €95 million is expected. However, the manufacturer warned of possible delivery bottlenecks. “The continued tense situation in the supply of electronic components could lead to limitations in SMA's ability to deliver its products in the second half of the year,” it said. “The management board is responding to the situation with closer and more intensive supplier management and a stockpiling strategy.”
SMA attributed the decline in turnover and sales in the first half of the year to the ongoing uncertainties in connection with the corona pandemic among small and medium-sized companies, which are currently reluctant to invest in PV solutions. In contrast, the development of sales in the Home Solutions and Large Scale & Project Solutions segments is different, for which the company recorded an increase in sales, despite the shortage of electronic components.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/12/canadian-solar-posts-solid-q2-results-lowers-2021-shipment-guidance/,"FINANCE,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 12, 2021","Canadian Solar posts solid Q2 results, lowers 2021 shipment guidance","Chinese-Canadian PV module manufacturer Canadian Solar was able to significantly improve revenue and shipments in the second quarter of the year, despite what its CEO, Shawn Qu, defined as challenging market conditions.
The company achieved record sales of US$1.43 billion during the period, which is 105% more than it did a year earlier and 31% more than in the first quarter of this year. Quarterly shipments, meanwhile, totaled 3.66 GW, up 26% year-on-year and 17% quarter-over-quarter.
“We posted our highest quarterly revenue of $1.43 billion in the second quarter and made significant progress to capitalize on growth in the battery storage market,” said CFO, Huifeng Chang. “We ended the second quarter with $1.3 billion in cash, and have raised approximately $110 million to date from our at-the-market equity offering program, which is well on track.”
Net profit declined from $23 million in the second quarter of last year to $11 million in the latest quarter. The company attributed this profit drop to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses and said it was also compensated by an unspecified income tax benefit.
“Although polysilicon and transportation costs remained elevated, we continue to raise module pricing, prioritize margins while maximizing capacity utilization, and continue to improve on our product and manufacturing efficiency as we take further cost control measures,” said Yan Zhuang, the president of the company's CSI Solar.
At the end of the latest quarter, the manufacturer had an annual PV module production capacity of 19.7 GW with 5.1 GW of ingot capacity, 8.7 GW of wafer production lines and 13.3 GW of cell output capability. By the end this year, module capacity is expected to reach 22.7 GW, ingot capacity will remain unchanged at 5.1 GW and cell output at 13.9 GW with the wafer figure reaching 11.5 GW.
Canadian Solar said it expects revenues of $5.6-6 billion this year, on the back of 16-17 GW of shipments. In its previous outlook, it had estimated shipments to be in the range of 18-20 GW. Shipments of 1.8-2.3 GW are expected in the current three-month reporting period.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/12/germany-needs-446-gw-of-pv-for-100-renewables-scenario/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"AUGUST 12, 2021",Germany needs 446 GW of PV for 100% renewables scenario,"From pv magazine Germany
Experts agree that if Germany wants to achieve its energy transition and goal of climate neutrality, it must massively grow its solar PV, wind, and solar thermal energy capacity. “In order to cover 100 percent of our electricity requirements with renewables, we have to install 6 to 8 times more photovoltaic output than today,” said Christoph Kost, head of the Energy Systems and Energy Management group at Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE.
This growth would correspond to an installed PV capacity of 303 to 446 GW. The output of the solar thermal systems, meanwhile, would have to be at least tripled from the current around 15 GW to between 45 and 49 GW, according to a study that the researchers conducted on behalf of Greenpeace.
A lot of space is required for such strong growth in the next few years. However, according to the paper, there are more than enough surfaces available. If installed in agricultural areas, artificial lakes, facades, parking lots, streets, noise barriers, or vehicles, solar could reach an installed power of up to 3,160 GW.
“Here, photovoltaics is combined with agriculture, floats on flooded open-cast mines, fits into building and vehicle superstructures, follows traffic routes or covers areas that have already been sealed, such as parking lots,” said Harry Wirth, who is in charge of the Integrated Photovoltaics research field at Fraunhofer ISE. “The integration of photovoltaic systems in such areas that are already in use opens up huge potential for power generation – and creates a wealth of additional synergies.”
The paper further states that significant growth of PV could create thousands of new jobs in Germany. For instance, the establishment of vertically integrated PV production in Europe would create around 750 jobs per GW of module manufacturing capacity, according to Fraunhofer ISE. At the same time, the current dependency on imports for PV components and their CO2 footprint could be reduced. The installation of new PV power plants would add another 3,500 jobs per GW. Fraunhofer ISE also refers to the low levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) reached by PV in Germany, which today range between €0.03 and €0.05/kWh for large power plants and between €0.06 and €0.11/kWh for rooftop systems with an output of up to 30 kW.
Political unwillingness alone stands in the way of a solar boom, stated Greenpeace. “It is irresponsible that regulatory hurdles are still blocking the expansion of solar energy,” said Jonas Ott, Greenpeace expert on renewables. “Both solar and wind energy must be massively expanded. Only if the federal government stops its policy of preventing renewables will Germany make progress in terms of climate protection.”
The goals outlined by Fraunhofer ISE are ambitious, but feasible. The annual PV expansion must be tripled to at least 15 GW. “In order to raise the [potential], the federal government must immediately introduce measures such as compulsory solar power for new buildings and roof renovations, and increase the tender volumes,” continued Ott.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/12/can-100-billion-in-green-finance-be-raised-annually-to-help-emerging-economies-fight-climate-change/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,NORTHERN AFRICA,WORLD",,"AUGUST 12, 2021",Can $100 billion in green finance be raised annually to help emerging economies fight climate change?,"For two weeks in November, at the culmination of the U.K.’s presidency of COP26, the Scottish city of Glasgow will play host to what many believe will be the biggest gathering of world leaders ever held. They will be there to try to reach a global accord on fighting climate change.
For the Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund (EAIF) and its parent organization, the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG), COP26 is likely to bring considerable global focus on what it does and how it does it.
EAIF’s primary job is to provide long-term debt capital to support the development of infrastructure projects in Africa and mobilize private capital to invest in those projects. By the end of 2020, it had invested US$1.9 billion and mobilized $14 billion of private capital. It lends between $10 million and $65 million to qualifying projects, most of which are promoted, built and run by private sector businesses.
EAIF has a current project loan portfolio of over $1 billion. The fund operates across nine infrastructure projects, with some 50% in energy. To date, it has backed 23 renewable energy projects in hydro, geothermal, biomass, and solar. Established and productive solar projects are to be found in Mali, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Uganda. More green energy projects are in the fund’s pipeline. Later this year, the fund expects to reach two milestones: investment in renewable energy will exceed half a billion dollars, and 1,000 MW of renewable energy will have been financed.
Some new projects have already been announced, including in Burkina Faso, where EAIF has loaned €29 million to Urbasolar, which is ultimately owned by Swiss company AXPO. Urbasolar’s €35.4 million, 30 MW plant will supply all its power to Burkina Faso’s national power utility. EAIF expects to announce its second solar financing in Mozambique shortly, where a new 15 MW plant will be owned and operated by Central Electrica de Tetereane SA. Its majority shareholder is Globeleq, the London-based business that specializes in the African power sector.
The reason there will be focus on EAIF and PIDG at this year’s COP26 is because project finance for infrastructure in emerging economies is one of the central issues on the agenda. The COP26 official website says, “Developing countries in particular need support. Developed countries must deliver on their promise to raise at least $100 billion every year in climate finance to support developing countries.
“To achieve our climate goals, every company, every financial firm, every bank, insurer and investor will need to change. Countries need to manage the increasing impacts of climate change on their citizens’ lives and they need the funding to do it.
“The scale and speed of the changes we need to make will require all forms of finance: Public finance for the development of infrastructure we need to transition to a greener and more climate-resilient economy. Private finance to fund technology and innovation, and to help turn the billions of public money into trillions of total climate investment.”
What COP26 proposes is an enormous global public/private partnership to unlock the funds to promote and enable the climate change agenda and find it sufficient capital to really make an impact. To first slow the rate of global warming and then, over decades, to pull the world back from potential catastrophe.
Nearly 20 years ago, EAIF was set up to help close the huge project infrastructure gap that existed in Africa, and which still exists today. In many parts of the continent, long-term debt finance is rarely available at a price or with terms that are affordable for private sector project developers. EAIF has been a pioneer in public/private partnerships. Its core funding – equity – comes from four governments: the U.K., The Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. It has raised capital to lend from private sector finance organizations, for example Allianz Global Investors and Standard Chartered Bank.
It also borrows from development finance institutions such as the African Development Bank, Germany’s KFW, and FMO of The Netherlands. The fund is managed on behalf of PIDG by the international asset management business, Ninety One. Borrowing from EAIF is on commercial terms, though it is often a flexible lender and one with long horizons. “Patient capital,” is perhaps the most accurate description.
The climate change agenda is now firmly embedded in the work of EAIF, as it is in all the PIDG companies. Project sponsors, contractors, and equipment suppliers are expected to have robust environmental and climate mitigation policies in design, specification, procurement, and operations, before and during construction and in long-term operations.
Applying high standards have serious long term benefits in the reliability and productivity of plant, the skills and rewards of local employees, the impact on economic resilience, the reduction in poverty and the long-term health of the planet. In short, being good is good business.
If, as the world hopes, COP26 does result in $100 billion raised annually from public and private sources for investment in emerging economies, those funds will need to be deployed and managed by organizations with the established machinery and the corporate culture that understand the needs of developers to see a return on capital, the needs of nations to bring the benefits of clean energy to economic development, and the needs of the global population to see funds invested wisely.
As the world addresses the urgency of climate change, organizations like PIDG/EAIF will increasingly work with financial institutions and project developers who recognize the need not only for flexible long-term capital, but also that we may not get a second chance to hold off the worst effects of climate change. Getting it right may be more than simply an ambition. It may be a burning necessity.

This is due to the formation of lithium polysulfides during the fabrication process and is the reason for the rapid deterioration of their capacity.
Scientists from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) in Japan claim to have overcome this issue by using two new materials – titanium oxide (TiO2) and titanium nitride (TiN).
During the fabrication of a lithium-sulfur battery, the lithium always reacts with sulfur, they said, noting that initially this combination produces lithium polysulfide, which can easily dissolve into polysulfides and negatively affect device performance. To improve the batteries, the lithium polysulfide should immediately begin to transform the final product into either lithium sulfide (Li2S) or lithium persulfide (Li2S2).
In the new battery configuration, the use of TiO2 is designed to absorb undesired polysulfides, while the TiN accelerates the absorption process. The scientists developed the best-performing battery by coating a carbon nanotube framework (CNT) with 10 nm of TiN and 5 nm of TiO2 and adopting an annealing post-treatment, which resulted in a uniform TiN-TiO2 heterostructure with high catalytic ability.
“The corresponding lithium-sulfur battery shows enhanced electrochemical performance with high specific capacity of 1289 mAh g−1 at 1 C and capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles at 2 C,” the Japanese scientists stated.
This performance translates into shorter charging times, longer life between charges, and greater overall lifespans, they claimed. They described their battery and the related manufacturing process in “Long-life lithium-sulfur batteries with high areal capacity based on coaxial CNTs@TiN-TiO2 sponge,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.
The University of Maryland and the Argonne National Laboratory have also recently conducted research on the polysulfide issue for sulfur-lithium batteries.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/12/ligand-free-perovskite-quantum-dot-solar-cell-with-9-3-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 12, 2021",Ligand-free perovskite quantum dot solar cell with 9.3% efficiency,"Researchers at the University of Sevilla in Spain have fabricated a ligand-free solar cell based on colloidal perovskite quantum dots (CPDTs) that has shown a power conversion efficiency of 9.3% and improved stability.
In this kind of cell,  insulating organic molecules are used as ligands around the perovskite quantum dots to prevent aggregation. “These ligands limit the chemical and thermal stability of the devices made with them and, most importantly, hinder charge transport, which, to be optimized, requires lengthy purification and ligand exchange processing,” the Spanish group specified. “This will necessarily increase the cost of CPQD devices, which might compromise their commercialization.”
The quantum dots are based on a kind of perovskite known as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and were synthesized within a porous silica (SiO2) matrix with a narrow nanopore size distribution, which translates, according to the scientists, into a fine control over the QD size and the spectral position of their electronic bandgap.
“Our cell requires an additional step that is the deposition of the silica nanoparticles layer,” research co-author, Mauricio Calvo Roggiani, told pv magazine, adding that the other parts of the cell are designed as those in conventional devices. “This is not an impediment from a technological point of view since nanoparticle coating on top of the conductive glass was developed in the past.” This matrix is claimed to create a protective and stabilizing environment for the embedded nanocrystals.
This approach is described as an alternative to those used in conventional QD-based solar cells, which are commonly characterized by the sensitization of a conducting scaffold or charge transport through an assembly of organic-ligand-coated colloidal nanocrystals. The new technique is said to avoid complex synthetic and post-manufacturing countermeasures that must be taken if organic capping layers arise on the surface of semiconductor nanocrystals.
The 9.3%-efficient solar cell showed an open-circuit voltage of 1.02 V, a short-circuit current of 1.42 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 56,1%. Furthermore, the PQDs embedded in the porous scaffold exhibited a more stable performance than their bulk counterpart.
The device is presented in the study Ligand-Free MAPbI3 Quantum Dot Solar Cells Based on Nanostructured Insulating Matrices, published in RRL Solar.
Quantum dots – nanoparticles of semiconductor material able to carry a charge – have been investigated for their solar cell potential in various materials for at least a decade and have made impressive progress since the first reported cell efficiency for the technology – 2.7% in 2010.
Researchers at South Korea’s Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) created a 12.82%-efficient organic hybrid series tandem photovoltaic device combining quantum dots and organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive materials, while another research group at Australia’s University of Queensland achieved 16.6% efficiency by synthesizing a quantum dot solar cell from a halide perovskite. The NREL set the previous record for quantum dot cell efficiency in 2017 at 13.4%, working with a similar lead halide perovskite.
More recently, an international research group developed a flexible quantum dot solar cell based on all-inorganic cesium-lead iodide (CsPbI3) perovskite, which is also known as black perovskite. The stability issues and degradation mechanisms holding back QD material were also investigated by scientists at TU Dresden in Germany.

German PV module manufacturer Bauer Solartechnik GmbH has unveiled two new PV modules for residential and commercial rooftop solar projects.
Its new BS-M10 panels series includes two PV modules with outputs of 400 W and 405 W. The panels became available for sale from this month, the manufacturer said.
The two modules feature 10-busbar half-cells with efficiencies of 21%. A total of 108 half cells have been used for the modules, which measure 1,723 mm x 1,133 mm x 35 mm and weigh 21.7 kg.  The panels are available with black aluminum frames and white or black backsheets.
Bauer Solartechnik said the use of half cells reduces power losses due to lower cell resistance. The cells also increase total reflection, it said, noting that the increase in the number of busbars to 10 helps to improve module performance.
It also claimed that the cell arrangement will reduce performance losses when the modules are shaded. The hollow chamber frames, which are made of anodized aluminum, are torsion-resistant and corrosion-free. They are also compatible with all common mounting systems, the company said.
The new solar modules are immediately available to buy. However, due to high demand, the company has been unable to make any statements about delivery volumes thus far.
Bauer Solartechnik has a global production capacity of more than 500 MW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/12/post-snec-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CHINA",,"AUGUST 12, 2021",Post-SNEC storage,"From pv magazine 08/2021
Tier-1 energy storage system integrators all participated in the SNEC PV Power Expo 2021, including Sungrow and Hyper Strong, China’s two largest integrators, according to 2020 statistics from the China Energy Storage Alliance (CNESA). Well-known players – including Huawei, Goodwe, Shanghai Electric, CLOU Electronics, and Cubenergy Technology – were also visible at the exhibition. These manufacturers mostly utilize China-made lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries. Huawei uses LFP from BYD and Eve Energy. GoodWe, Cubenergy and Sinexcel use LFP from Eve Energy. Hyper Strong uses LFP from CATL, while CLOU Electronics uses batteries from Higee Energy.
The standardization of battery cells is now underway. At present, the most common cell capacities are 90 Ah and 280 Ah, while 90Ah batteries are primarily applied to stationary energy storage systems in the tens to hundreds of kilowatt-hours range. Stationary storage systems at the megawatt-hours scale use 280 Ah batteries.
At present, front-of-the-meter batteries are leading China’s energy storage deployments, with C&I storage accounting for a small share. Therefore, companies focus on utility-scale stationary storage, with capacity ranging from hundreds of kilowatt-hours to 6 MWh and beyond for a single unit.
A massive surge in the market and favorable EV battery prices make EV battery manufacturing the Chinese industry’s primary focus. Rising demand for energy storage has led to short supplies of lithium-ion batteries, with delivery extending to more than six months. This may provide opportunities for more manufacturers to develop their storage business. Samsung SDI, for instance, has significantly lower cell capacity than CATL and LG, but it controls the largest share of the stationary energy storage market. In addition to CATL and BYD, this year’s SNEC saw applications of cells from Eve Energy in products across companies.
Competition in the EV battery market is intense. Stationary storage may provide some room for more manufacturers to get a slice of the pie.
Sungrow’s latest “1+X” modular inverter, unveiled at SNEC 2021, is a breakthrough that can fulfill demand beyond traditional centralized solar applications and cover all scenarios. The device features 1,500 V LFP batteries, in a minimum unit of 1.1 MW, ranging up to 8.8 MW when connected in parallel. Its reverse-charging feature also enables the system to provide ancillary services, optimizing application scenarios and economic benefits of solar+storage projects.
Hyper Strong, one of China’s leading energy storage integration and service suppliers, provides liquid cooling solutions to replace the conventional air cooling. The HyperL1 solution claims several technical innovations, including 80% higher power density than air cooling, 20% higher lifecycles (up to 15 years), 20% less power consumption, high-efficiency thermal management, and an IP67 protection rating. The company also provides high-pressure air cooling with 45% higher power density and up to 5.5 MWh of system energy density.
CLOU Electronics launched E30, its fifth-generation integrated liquid- cooled ESS. This is a brand-new solution for applications spanning generation, grid ancillary services, regulation, and peak shaving. The device comes in a 2.5 MW/2.5 MWh capacity, and supports voltages ranging from 1,000 V to 1,500 V. The company’s patented thermal solution can run at high power efficiency throughout a 24-hour cycle.
GoodWe, one of the world’s largest ESS inverter suppliers, unveiled the high-voltage Lynx Home S and low-voltage Lynx Home U battery series, which can couple with its power conversion systems to achieve solar+storage self-generation and self-consumption. The Lynx Home S series features a 1C charge rate, meaning that it has high efficiency that can be fully charged within an hour. Both models of the Lynx Home series use LFP batteries from Eve Energy. Moreover, the systems incorporate module auto recognition for more flexible installation.
The rising standardization of cells at 90 Ah and 280 Ah, along with modular lithium battery system technology, indicates that the energy storage industry is gradually reaching maturity. These solutions offer flexible applications and product selection. Regarding safety and power density, LFP has been widely adopted by Chinese manufacturers, given their faith in domestic-made cells and concerns over safety issues that rose from a series of ESS fires in South Korea that occurred in 2018 and 2019. As energy storage systems could be tens to hundreds of times bigger than EVs in scale, they require much stricter thermal management and sophisticated cooling. This provides an opportunity for liquid-cooled systems, which offer higher efficiency and take up less space compared with air cooling. In light of this, liquid cooling is expected to become mainstream in the future.
On the product strategy side, there are mature products available for both front-of-the-meter and behind-the-meter battery storage. Sungrow, outside of the Chinese market, is actively expanding into utility-scale energy storage in the United States and India. GoodWe, on the other hand, is focused on the residential energy storage sectors in Europe and Australia.
Although China’s ESS market lags behind Europe and the United States in terms of maturity, pace, and market share, the government’s supportive polices are spurring development.
InfoLink forecasts that, under an optimistic scenario, China’s cumulative installed electrochemical energy storage capacity will reach 60 GWh by 2025, reaching the global market share taken by the United States, and likely to surpass the U.S. market by 2030. China, having dominated the battery and PV manufacturing sectors, will see the birth of more large businesses related to ESS, as the industry grows alongside.

Australia’s national science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), has revealed plans to team up with Adelaide-based Space Machines Company (SMC) to test its next-generation solar PV cell technologies.
The CSIRO will explore the potential of its perovskite-based, next-gen solar cells on SMC’s spacecraft Optimus-1, which is due to be launched next year by Gold Coast rocket company Gilmour Space Technologies.
Flexible thin-film solar is not a new concept, but it has thus far remained a niche area, with efficiencies and device lifetimes lagging those achieved in silicon PV or thin films deposited on glass. However, the CSIRO is pursuing the development of printable solar cells that are lightweight, thin and semi-transparent.
The science agency has been researching both organic PV (OPV) and perovskite solar cells, which are made from a mix of organic and inorganic materials, rather than traditional silicon solar cells. Printable “solar inks” are deposited onto flexible plastic films that can then be connected to make solar panels of significant size.
The CSIRO claims to have achieved efficiencies of greater than 19% on small-scale devices, while the pilot-scale, roll-to-roll printing lines have successfully fabricated 30-centimeter-wide flexible solar modules that can be cut to length. The weight and flexibility of the panels make then ideal for places where traditional solar panels are too heavy or bulky.
Mei Gao, a CSIRO principal research scientist, said that the collaboration with SMC will be the first time the agency’s printable solar cells have been tested in space. She expects the results to provide benefits for more traditional applications.
“We will collect data from this mission to explore new applications of our technology,” Gao said. “Solar films are about making solar energy more accessible, on earth and in space.”
Solar is the primary energy source in space, but Rajat Kulshrestha, SMC's co-founder and chief executive, said space-graded rigid and foldable solar panels, the main alternatives today, are heavy and extremely expensive. While printable solar cells have been less efficient than the rigid versions, in the future they could be an order of magnitude cheaper than traditional space-grade solar cells and exceptionally volume efficient.
While the initial tests will use static printed cells that are fixed to the space craft’s surface, the CSIRO technology will be deployed alongside the more traditional solar panels so that their relative performance can be assessed.
“This is a fantastic example of collaboration between a privately funded space company and a government agency to develop the Australian sovereign capability in space,” said Kulshrestha. “We are flying traditional [solar panels], but we will be taking CSIRO panels as payloads to ensure that we can test them and actually also get a benchmark across existing performance compared to traditional solar panels. I think this will be great telemetry to get, to be able to then go to the next step and really start to work more closely in the future with CSIRO.”
