The institute and two pharmaceutical companies, Takeda and BMK, aim to build a steam-generating heat pump that can reach temperatures of 200 C to 260 C by using natural refrigerants.
The new technology will build on an existing heat pump that uses a reciprocating compressor and delivers steam at 165 C, developed by Germany-based Sustainable Process Heat. The heat pump is being adapted to use natural refrigerants as part of the AHEAD project.
The new system will first heat water from 65 C to about 130 C, evaporating it in the process. The vapor will then be compressed at 11 bar, heating it to over 184 C, as required for pharmaceutical production.
“The heat pump will be powered by electricity,” an AIT spokesperson told pv magazine. “The technical challenge here is that there may be thermal problems in the compressor or problems with the chiller oil due to the high temperatures. Also, most conventional refrigerants cannot be used for such high temperatures.”
The research project will be the first to integrate a steam-generating heat pump in industrial operations, according to an AIT statement. The team hopes the gas-free system will reduce carbon dioxide production by up to 90% at one of Takeda’s largest pharmaceutical production sites in Vienna, Austria.
“Industry is one of the central levers for achieving European and national climate targets. Around a third of all energy is consumed here, and the sector is responsible for almost 50% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions,” said Bernd Vogl, managing director of Austria’s Climate and Energy Fund. “In order to make industrial processes more sustainable, innovative technologies must be developed and companies, research institutions and the public sector must work shoulder to shoulder – as is the case here with this ‘AHEAD' project.”
The AHEAD demonstrator is expected to start operations at the end of 2024 and last for a period of a year. The project is funded by the Climate and Energy Fund and is part of Austria’s New Energy for Industry (NEFI) research initiative.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/30/new-cushion-solution-to-take-stress-off-perovskite-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JANUARY 30, 2023",New ‘cushion’ solution to take stress off perovskite solar cells,"Scientists led by Germany’s Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) developed an additive for perovskite materials, which it has shown acts a ‘cushion’, protecting the more delicate perovskite crystals from stress induced by changing temperatures.
The group was also able to add to HZB’s list of achievements – including the 32.5% efficiency record for a perovskite-silicon tandem cell – by fabricating perovskite cells using p-i-n architecture that achieved a record-setting 24.6% efficiency. This architecture is inherently more stable, but usually less efficient, than the more commonly used n-i-p design.
“Sunlight can heat up the inside of a PV cell to 80 Celsius; in the dark, the cell then cools down immediately to the outside temperature,” explained HZB Professor Antonio Abate. “This triggers large mechanical stresses in the thin layer of perovskite microcrystals, creating defects and even local phase transitions, so that the thin film loses its quality.”
The group found that working with a polymer compound it calls v-pV2F (full name b-poly(1,1-difluoroethylene) could improve the p-i-n solar cell’s stability even further.
“This polymer seems to wrap around the individual perovskite microcrystals in the thin film like a soft shell, creating a kind of cushion against thermomechanical stress,” Abate explained.
Perovskite solar cells fabricated with this additive were put through various tests, the results of which can be found in the paper Highly efficient p-i-n perovskite solar cells that endure temperature variations, published in Science.
Cells measuring 18 mm² reached a maximum efficiency of 24.6%, while larger 1 cm² devices achieved 23.1%. The cells were subject to more than 100 temperature cycles between 80 C and -60 C, as well as 1,000 hours of continuous illumination – which HZB says is equivalent to roughly one year of outdoor use.
These cells retained 96% of their initial performance after 1000 hours of simulated sunlight at 25 C, and 88% when the test was conducted at 75 C. In addition to its cushion effect, the additive was shown to improve the cell’s efficiency by affecting the transport of charge carrier, allowing the group to set the p-i-n device efficiency record.
HZB will now work to reduce the performance lost over time even further, to levels that might be considered acceptable in commercial devices.
“Even under these extreme stresses, they still achieved 96 % efficiency in the end. That is already in the right order of magnitude,” Abate noted. “If it is now feasible to reduce the losses a little further, perovskite solar modules could still produce most of their original output after 20 years – this goal is now coming within reach.”

Herbert Diess, the former CEO of German carmaker Volkswagen, unveiled a plan to build a vertically integrated PV module factory in Europe.
“I want to bring the photovoltaic industry back to Europe,” he said in a podcast with Gabor Steingart for The Pioneer. “Photovoltaics is competitive with coal and nuclear and will become even more popular through further scaling. Solar energy will soon be the dominant energy source.”
He called for greater independence from China for supplies of PV components. He noted that the once-thriving solar industry has almost completely disappeared from Europe. But he said the first reconstruction attempts are now underway – the new Meyer Burger plants in Germany are one example.
“We were too impatient. Every industry has a ramp-up period, After all, China managed what Europe couldn't do,” said Diess. “We should bring solar back, as we can be competitive. After all, there is only one large research landscape, many installers and PV system providers, but small module manufacturers … I am currently in talks with several players in Europe, but also with Chinese companies.”
The February edition of pv magazine, due out next week, is devoted entirely to energy storage, with topics ranging from how battery suppliers can avoid supply-chain related policy risks, to the plans Russia hatched to be a hydrogen superpower – before it invaded Ukraine.
Diess said there is a need for large manufacturers and also policy support. He said he aims to set up 20 GW of integrated PV production capacity. He estimates another plant is needed for polysilicon – two for wafers and ingots, and four for solar cells. A total of 15 to 20 factories would need to be built in order to achieve 20 GW at all stages of the value chain, said the former car manager. He estimates the investment required for this at €10 billion ($10.9 billion) to €20 billion.
“We need framework and market conditions that allow such investments,” said Diess.

In a joint statement, the two ministries said that three technologies related to the PV manufacturing industry could be included in the catalog – wafers, black silicon, and ingot casting.  If the three categories are added to the restrictions list, manufacturers will need technology export licenses from the respective provincial departments to export such products.
China accounted for more than 98% of global wafer production for the solar industry in 2021, according to reports from the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA). Although the plan is still in a phase of public consultation, this attempt shows the country's efforts to protect its most advanced solar technology and maintain the competitiveness of its solar industry.
“Such technology-related export restrictions are nothing new,” Frank Haugwitz, senior adviser of Apricum Cleantech Advisory, told pv magazine. “The last version of this list was published in August 2020 but it took a good two years to come into effect after the consultation process was completed.”
Haugwitz said the intention is clear – China plans to keep its lead in this part of the value chain.
“At the same time, if you take into account the years of significant investment in wafer R&D, this may not be surprising,” said Haugwitz. “On the one hand, it affects plant manufacturers, but also producers who may be considering setting up wafer production in other regions. In other words, such a technology transfer abroad would also be subject to such restrictions.”
*The headline of the article has been amended on February 2 to reflect that the proposed restrictions relate to the exports of production equipment and technologies for polysilicon and wafers.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/30/turkey-sets-minimum-price-for-solar-cell-imports/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TURKEY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 30, 2023",Turkey sets minimum price for solar cell imports,"The Turkish government has published new regulations regarding imports of solar cells. The new rules will go into force within 30 days from the date of publication.
They follow the publication of provisions published in 2021, which state that the import duty on solar modules has to be calculated per kilogram, rather than by square meter, as was the case under the previous regulation. Under the government's new calculation method, the minimum price for imports of solar cells will be $60/kg.
Hakki Karacaoglan, the CEO of Germany-based consultancy KRC Energy, said that the new rules could drive down the market share of imported cells in the Turkish PV market, as they favor local manufacturers.
“But as defined in the regulation, the $60/kg value currently does not affect the business, since a kilogram of cells is already more expensive than $60,” he told pv magazine. “This may change, however, if polysilicon and solar cell prices will drop, as expected, or if the government will decide to increase further the $60 threshold.”
If Turkish module manufacturers decide to import solar cells above the $60/kg limit, they will be hit with import duties.
There are currently two manufacturers in Turkey that also produce or plan to produce solar cells – Kalyon Solar Technologies in Ankara and Smart Solar Technologies in Izmir. Kalyon Solar has secured TRY 7.62 billion ($410 million) of funding from the Turkish government to set up a 2 GW vertically integrated solar factory while Smart Solar Technologies has obtained TRY 3.7 billion for a 2 GW factory.

It said electrocution and fire are the main risks associated with faulty plug-in panels.
“For these products, there are a number of situations that may cause these risks,” Elsäkerhetsverket spokesperson Mikael Carlson told pv magazine. “The regulations state that a single fault shall not lead to electrocution or fire. Since these products use plugs with accessible pins, this is not fulfilled.”
Elsäkerhetsverket said that the pins on plugs could become dangerous even when they are not in sockets.
“There is also a risk of electrocution for electricians doing electrical installation work in the building, not knowing that there could be local PV-generators connected to the system that may be faulty,” Carlson said. “If there are local generators that incorrectly feed disconnected networks, there is a risk of electrocuting for technicians during work.”
Elsäkerhetsverket said that plug-in panels could catch fire because their current could exceed the electrical design of systems.
“It is possible to consume more power than the electrical wires are dimensioned for if the fuse for the feed-in outlet also supplies another outlet, which can result in fires,” Carlson said. “If many apartments connect these products and they all end up feeding into the same phase, it could also cause problems in the electrical system of the building, such as fires.”
Elsäkerhetsverket told homeowners to rely on professional installers for PV system dimensioning.
“The standard SS 43640400 does not allow for plug-in solutions, so the product must be permanently connected to the property's electrical system,” Carlson said. “The affected parts of the electrical system must be dimensioned for this change and warning signs shall be applied at appropriate places in the building.”
He said it is the responsibility of manufacturers to be well informed about regulatory frameworks and comply with legal requirements.
“The ‘Blue Guide’ from the European Commission is a good starting point and applicable standards can be ordered from SEK Svensk Elstandard,” said Carlson.
Elsäkerhetsverket said that there might be other legal requirements, such as building permits or requests from the local emergency services, that should be considered when placing solar panels on balconies.
“The installation may also need pre-approval from the grid owner, and the electricity meter may need to be changed so that any feed to the grid is measured,” concluded Carlson.

India's SCCL has commissioned its first floating solar power plant at the Singareni Thermal Power Station (STPS) in Jaipur, in the Indian state of Telangana. 
State-owned SCCL is setting up a 15 MW (AC)/19.5 MW (DC) floating solar power plant at the STPS reservoir. In the first phase, it commissioned 5 MW of floating solar capacity. It expects to finish the second 10 MW phase by the end of March.
The 5 MW(AC)/6.5 MW(DC) floating solar plant was executed by Hyderabad-headquartered Novus Green Energy Systems.
“The plant uses transparent glass-to-glass solar modules, which are more efficient than traditional solar modules,” said Anshuman Yenigalla, managing director of Novus Green.
Novus Green's in-house teams built the 5 MW floating PV plant. The solar panels were manufactured at its facility in India. Domestic supplier FloatVolt provided the floating boards.
“The project faced several challenges, such as the design and manufacturing of floating boards meeting all testing standards and fixing frameless glass-to-glass modules onto the float boards,” said Yenigalla. “The overall design was vetted by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), making it the first floating solar project to be vetted by a premium institute like IIT.”

The “domino-like snow removal system” (DSRS) uses electricity from uncovered PV modules to remove snow from solar arrays, string by string.
“With a high snow removal efficiency, it is almost free of utility power consumption,” researcher Wen Liu told pv magazine. “The snow removal principle is verified to have no negative impact on the performance of PV modules by experiments cooperated with Chinese PV module manufacturer JA Solar.”
The researchers said that the string that initially removes snow supplies power for the subsequent snow-covered strings, in a sequence that they compare to falling dominoes. The system only uses grid electricity with the first panels, as the PV electricity is responsible for subsequent snow removal.
The DSRS is connected to each of the PV system strings via tee-type MC4 connectors and PV cables. It uses the thermal effect of resistance to uniformly heat the entire PN junction area of the PV modules.
“The heat is transferred to the snow layer through the EVA film and the tempered PV glass, which causes the snow to melt,” the Chinese team said, noting that the system relies on a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) algorithm that launches the removal process with high sunlight utilization.
“The snow melting process occurs at the surface of PV modules, which is regarded as a one-dimensional heat transfer perpendicular to the surface of PV modules,” said the scientists.
The researchers tested a system prototype in a real winter snow-cover environment and found it can achieve “good” snow removal in environments with, a minimum tilt angle of 27 degrees, a minimum temperature of –14.8 C, and minimum fluctuant solar radiation of 248 W/m2 in an off-grid mode.
“The DSRS can deal with different types of snow, whose densities range from 121.05 kg/m3 to 480.10 kg/m3 with thicknesses varying between 15.5 mm and 32.5 mm,” they explained.
They said the system could have a cost of between CNY 0.17 ($0.025)/W and CNY 0.29 CNY/W installed in PV systems ranging in size from 10 kW to 30 kW. The payback time is estimated between 2.9 and 4.3 years.
“The bills-of-material (BOM) cost for this additional box is less than $500 and its installation can be performed with only a few more electrical cables and three port connectors, so the cost is really low,” Liu said. “To my best knowledge, there isn't any low-cost solution for snow removal so far and I believe that this technology may become widely adopted.”
The research group presented the system in “A novel domino-like snow removal system for roof PV arrays: Feasibility, performance, and economic benefits,” which was recently published in Applied Energy. The group includes academics from the University of Science and Technology of China, the Xiong'an Institute of Innovation, and JA Solar.
“This paper presents a systematic work around the feasibility, performance, and economic benefits of the domino-like snow removal system and confirms it is an excellent solution to removing snow on PV modules and has great potential to promote PV deployment where the snow covers for a few months in winter,” the group concluded.
