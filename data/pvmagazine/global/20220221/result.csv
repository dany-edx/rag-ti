“Congestion management does not offer a solution here, according to our research,” the company said in a statement.
It also invited the developers of large scale power plants in the area to immediately contact its experts for advice. “Even in areas where there is still capacity, we recommend requesting capacity in due time. Liander cannot guarantee that capacity will remain available for a long time,” it also stated.
In December, Netbeheer Nederland, the Dutch association of national and regional power network operators, updated the congestion map for the high-voltage and medium-voltage grids. Dutch electricity transmission system operator (TSO) Tennet also recently developed an interactive online map showing the locations in the country where the power grid is most congested.
Over the past two years, Liander has implemented several measures to increase grid capacity in several Dutch regions afflicted by grid constraints, which are preventing more renewable energy plants from coming online. These include the deployment of two giant transformers and the application of congestion management to a bottleneck in the grid.

Austrian oil and gas provider OMV is planning to build a 5.59MW solar park at its Lobau oil tank facility near Vienna.
The company will invest around €4.5 million in the solar park, which will be connected to the facility's internal grid and will be used exclusively to power its operations.
The plant will be built with solar trackers and bifacial panels provided by undisclosed manufacturers. OMV expects the trackers to increase electricity production by 10% compared to an installation with fixed mounting systems, and the bifacial modules to increase it by 5%.
At the site, OMV can store around 1.63 million cubic meters of crude oil, intermediate and finished products and additives in 87 containers.
The solar park is not the first photovoltaic project of the group, which is one of the largest listed industrial companies in Austria. At the end of 2020, OMV, together with the electricity producer Verbund, commissioned what was then the largest photovoltaic ground-mounted PV plant in Austria, with an output of 11.4MW.
The company has also installed photovoltaic systems for its own consumption on the roofs of its filling stations in Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. According to OMV, the group has decided to replace the previously purchased external electricity, which comes from coal, oil, gas and nuclear power, with self-produced renewable electricity.

Under the terms of a deal with US-based power company Eleris Energy Ltd, five 200MW solar fields will be developed on the Swarna Dweep island in the Bay of Bengal, which the Bangladesh Army uses for training.
The plants will be connected to the Bangladeshi grid and will export any electricity not needed for on-site consumption, to help the nation towards a target of sourcing 40% of its power from renewables by 2041.
The deal, signed in Dhaka on Thursday by Eleris chief operating officer Jerry Price and Army Welfare Trust MD brigadier general Abul Mansur Md Ashraf Khan, follows a memorandum of understanding signed by Eleris and various Bangladeshi partners last year which related to 2.2GW of solar plans.
The solar sites will be constructed on the 360km2 island in the Meghna River which is part of the Noakhali district of the Chittagong division of Bangladesh, in the southeast of the country.
Eleris, based in Houston, Texas, states on its LinkedIn page that it constructs power projects in return for controlling stakes in the facilities.
No financial details about the solar plan were released by Eleris or the Army Welfare Trust.
Bangladesh currently hosts around 780MW of renewable energy generation capacity.

Indian solar manufacturers will continue to see strong demand for their modules aided by several policy measures over the medium term. However, it needs to be seen whether they will be able to meet all of this demand from the utility and non-utility segment, according to ICRA Ratings, which adds that quality of these modules also remains monitorable.
Responding to government policies aimed at creating demand for domestic modules, many of the domestic OEMs have announced sizeable capital expenditure to augment their cell and module capacity. This includes the capex for integrated facilities under the PLI scheme by the winning bidders; the recent increase in the PLI scheme outlay for solar modules — to INR 240 billion ($3.22 billion) from INR 45 billion ($600 million) earlier — is expected to support the setting up of additional cell and module manufacturing capacity of up to 40 GW.
Speaking about policy support, Girishkumar Kadam, ICRA senior vice president and co-group head of corporate rating, said, “The policy focus by the Government of India (GoI) in the renewable energy (RE) sector remains strong as also evident from the policy target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based capacity by CY 2030 as well as policy direction in the energy transition with net-zero emission target by 2070. In this context, capacity addition in solar energy segment within the RE is expected to remain significant with about 65-70% share by FY 2030, given the relatively lower execution challenges in the solar segment.”
“Further, the GoI has a solid policy focus to encourage the domestic manufacturing for photovoltaic (PV) modules through various policy measures announced in last two-three year period, such as notification of approved list of module manufacturers (ALMM) w.e.f. April 2021, imposition of basic customs duty (BCD) on imported cells and modules w.e.f. April 2022, award of manufacturing-linked PPAs for an aggregate capacity of 12 GW, ongoing implementation of production linked incentive (PLI) scheme as well as that of various central schemes announced earlier, requiring the use of domestic modules. Further, ALMM list has only domestic solar OEMs and there remains an uncertainty for inclusion of foreign solar OEMs as of now.”
However, timely commissioning and ramp-up of on-going capex in module manufacturing value chain remains critical in the near to medium term as domestic manufacturers relying on imported cells remain exposed to price fluctuations.
PV module prices have remained elevated over the last 10 to 12 months, owing to polysilicon demand-supply imbalances as well as supply chain disruptions in China. Given that the import dependency for the OEMs is expected to continue for sourcing of key components, the pricing behavior for polysilicon and cells in China thus remains a key monitorable, going forward.
Commenting further, Vikram V., ICRA vice president and sector head of corporate ratings, said, “OEMs based on imported cells remain exposed to volatility in cell/module price levels. Based on an imported module price level of 27 cents/watt for mono PERC modules and cell price at 15 cents/watt, the cost of modules from such domestic OEMs is expected to be lower by 10-11% post-April 2022, assuming the applicable BCD on imported cells/modules. However, the extent of discount will reduce, if the prices of imported cells and modules reduce from the prevailing level.”
For OEMs having integrated facilities, the scale of operations, the pace of technology adoption with the emerging trends in key markets such as in China and Europe as well as module price movement remain critical factors to ensure viability, he added.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/21/cisse-solar-cell-with-record-breaking-efficiency-of-14-4/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 21, 2022",CISSe solar cell with record-breaking efficiency of 14.4%,"Researchers at the Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) have fabricated a low bandgap copper, indium, sulfur, selenium (CISSe) solar cell that can be used as a bottom cell for applications in tandem cells with a top cell based on perovskite.
“CIGS bottom cells are usually expensive as these devices are made via vacuum technology,” the research's corresponding author, SeJin Ahn, told pv magazine. “With our new technology, we can lower the costs of tandem perovskite/CIGS solar cells.”
The scientists used a molecular ink based on N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), which is a common water-miscible liquid solvent used in the production of acrylic fibers, plastics, pesticides, and synthetic leather, for the air annealing of the cell's CISSe precursor films.
“We found that the air annealing temperature not only determined the degree of carbon removal (a well-known fact) but also affected the degree of crystallization in which the crystallinity of the precursor films was increased with increasing air annealing temperature, resulting in a stronger structuring of constituent atoms,” they emphasized, adding that the air-annealing temperature was also found to considerably affect the film growth kinetics during selenization.
Furthermore, they ascertained that the CISSe films have the same characteristics of copper-rich films, which are commonly used in thin-film cells due to their superior electronic properties.
The best solar cells developed by the Korean group were processed at an optimized air annealing temperature of 230 degrees Celsius. The champion device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 14.4%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.5636 V, a short-circuit current of 37.12 mA cm2, and fill factor of 68.80. The result is described by the academics as a world record for (nonhydrazine) solution-processed, low bandgap (Ga-free) CISSe solar cells. The previous best performance was 13.1%.
The solar cell was tested, together with a CISSe filtered device, in a four-tandem perovskite-CISSe cell with a semitransparent n–i–p perovskite top cell with an efficiency of 19.54%. “By summing the efficiency of the filtered CISSe device and that of the perovskite top cell, a 4T-tandem efficiency of 23.03% was obtained, which is also the highest efficiency among all-solution processed 4-T configurations,” the scientists stated. “In addition to this encouraging 4T tandem efficiency of 23.03%, it should be mentioned that there is still much room to further improve the tandem performance.”
All the details on the manufacturing process can be found in the study Air-processable high-efficiency CISSe solar cells from DMF molecular solution and their application to perovskite/CISSe tandems, which was recently published in Energy & Environmental Science.

The membership organization has reported a 36% rise on the 538MW of solar added in 2020 and cited rocketing gas prices as a motivation for commercial and industrial electricity users to switch to photovoltaics.

Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.

The trade body highlighted the 369MW of rooftop solar capacity installed last year as the highest volume added since the 869MW of new rooftop panels recorded in 2015. Solar Energy UK pointed out, that historic figure included a significant volume of subsidy support whereas the panels installed across the UK last year were subsidy free.
The fact all three main market segments – residential; commercial and industrial; and large-scale projects – all experienced steady, unsubsidized growth indicated solar has finally come of age in the UK, according to the trade body.
The UK reached 14.6GW of solar capacity at the end of December, with more than 5GW of it rooftop panels, according to Solar Energy UK.
And the organization, which announced the statistics on Thursday, said the outlook remains positive with the Future Homes Standard supplementary building regulations to be applied to new homes from this year, with the government recently announcing its contracts-for-difference clean energy tenders will be held annually from next year, and with Downing Street having pledged to remove what Solar Energy UK described as “unfair” taxation of businesses which install solar.
The trade body's announcement included quotes from Jamie Vaux, commercial director at its member, the Milton, England-based solar trade wholesaler Midsummer Wholesale. Vaux said: “It is indescribably insane. We are recruiting for a dozen open roles, have new starters every week, and opened new premises that will quadruple our warehouse space last week. Our design software saw 10,000-plus designs done last month. We hit absolute max capacity every day though we’re working around the clock to keep adding resources. It’s the fastest sustained growth we’ve ever seen.”

Their performance and stability, however, remain a major hurdle to overcome in order to bring them closer to a wider commercial maturity. This storage technology, on the other hand, offers the advantage that, at the industrial level, it could potentially use many of the manufacturing processes already developed for lithium-ion batteries, making them far easier than other materials to scale up.
With this in mind, scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed an aqueous zinc-ion battery based on a special hydrogel electrolyte that is claimed to offer more stability and larger capacity.
The electrolyte was made with polyacrylamide (PAM), zinc sulfate (ZnSO4), glycerol (GL), and acetonitrile (AN). These compounds are said to offer remarkable mechanical properties, high ionic conductivity, and modulated bonding interaction. Furthermore, the researchers added acrylamide (AM) and N,N ‘-methylene bisacrylamide (MBA) into the mixture to address the typical issue of zinc-ion batteries — the poor stability and performance in the wide temperature range of -20 to 60 degrees Celsius.
“The copolymer of acrylamide and N,N ‘-methylene diacrylamide is the 3D framework of hydrogel electrolyte, and zinc salt is the zinc source,” they explained. “The copolymer increased the proportion of intermolecular hydrogen bond between copolymer and water molecule, but decreased the proportion of intramolecular hydrogen bond between water molecule. The bonding interaction regulation can reduce the chance of freezing at low temperature and evaporation at high temperature, which is beneficial to expand the operating temperature range.”
The battery showed high cycling stability of over 3,000 cycles, a high reversibility thanks to a Coulombic efficiency of up to 99.5%, and electrochemical performance of 185 mAh·g over 10,000 cycles. “Another advantage of this hydrogel electrolyte is its good mechanical properties for flexible device applications,” the research team emphasized. “The voltage of the zinc-ion battery device remained constant after it was bent at different angles.”
The battery was presented in the paper Bonding interaction regulation in hydrogel electrolyte enable dendrite-free aqueous zinc-ion batteries from −20 to 60 °C, published in the Chemical Engineering Journal.

French hydrogen specialist Hydrogène de France (HDF) has announced it has secured further financing for what it claims to be the largest hydrogen production complex in the Caribbean – the Renewstable Barbados (RSB) project.
The new funds are being provided by French investment firm Rubis, which has secured a 51% share in the project, an investment that follows a strategic agreement signed between the two energy companies in June 2021.
HDF said it is also in talks with the renewable energy cooperative Barbados Sustainable Energy Cooperative Society, for a 30% share that the latter could acquire in the project before the start of construction.
Located in St Philip, in the southeast of the island, the RSB facility is aimed at replacing heavy fuel oil and kerosene consumption to help the state reach its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2030.
The complex will combine a 50MW photovoltaic plant with 128MWh of long-term green hydrogen storage and batteries. The solar part is described by the company as an agrivoltaic plant that will host a herd of 1,830 sheep.
The US$100 million Renewstable Barbados project is a replica of the Centrale Electrique de l’Ouest Guyanais (CEOG) project – a PV park and 128MWh, hydrogen-based storage station in Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, in northwestern French Guiana. It was launched by HDF in May 2018.
HDF currently claims to have 18 similar projects in different geographies around the world.

Under the terms of the renewable energy financing mechanism, reported on by pv magazine in late 2020, member states can take part either as “contributors” to the system, who will pay into a central pot to fund renewables projects, or as “host” nations, who agree to have the projects commissioned in their territory.
In this month’s edition, pv magazine takes a deep dive into the world of electromobility, with 22 pages of analysis taking in the market growth and expectations for electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide; how electricity networks will need to grow and adapt to make room for the electrification of transport; and the vital role for solar in all of this. We examine the growing trend for residential and commercial EV chargers linked to PV and optimized to make the most of solar kilowatt-hours, and take a look at some of the early movers working on vehicle-integrated PV – from solar sunroofs to full integration in vehicle bodywork. We also consider a range of e-mobility applications, from commercial trucks to family cars to electric bikes and other “last mile” delivery vehicles.
The commission in December invited member states to express an interest in joining the scheme.
Under the proposed program, member-state public money supplied by contributor nations to the fund would secure 80% of the emissions avoided by the electricity generated by the projects towards their own national greenhouse gas reduction targets. The emission reductions embodied by the remaining 20% of project output would be accredited to the national climate plans of the host nations of clean power sites.
The commission intends to pool the money raised and hold an EU-wide renewable energy tender across the interested host nations with the most competitive grant prices offered securing project development in the relevant countries. Private-sector contributions to the central fund – made by companies to secure renewable energy guarantees of origin to align with corporate climate pledges – would be accepted but private and EU-funded clean power projects would have their energy output counted only towards the bloc's climate goals, not to that of member states in which they are hosted.
Solar is one of the renewable energy technologies which can be allocated generation capacity under the plan, alongside wind power; geothermal; wave and ocean; hydro; biomass; landfill gas; biogas; sewage treatment plant gas; and ambient energy projects – featuring naturally-occurring thermal energy, such as hot springs.
The renewable energy financing mechanism would be implemented by the commission and its subordinate body the European climate, infrastructure and environment executive agency.

The application received a special mention from President Emmanuel Macron when he announced his government’s proposed energy policy on Feb. 10, which included a 100 GW by 2050 solar goal.
Xavier Daval, chair of the French solar commission, SER-Soler, told pv magazine that the recognition of agrivoltaics as one of the “three pillars” of solar development points to its importance in PV development in the country.
“We have to understand that [in the 100 GW policy announcement] for the very first time solar is identified as a solution,” said Daval. “Second, the president spoke about agri-PV, he uses the word as the third pillar of solar, with the three being rooftop, ground-mounted, and agrivoltaics.”
Daval noted that the 100 GW solar target should be viewed through the lens of it having been made during an election campaign. Alongside the solar goal, Macron announced that the country would build six new EPR2 type nuclear reactors under the policy.
“The game is not over [for solar],” remarked Daval. While the 100 GW by 2050 goal may appear impressive, it does represent around 5 GW of annual installations – well below the ambition of other European countries.
“We need to analyze this sequence as one of a series included in the French presidential campaign,” he continued. “For me, the way I read the actual dilemma that occurs in France between nuclear and renewable is the typical fight between the ancient and the modern, the glorious past of France against the uncertainty of intermittency.”
“Are we wanting to step into the unknown of the future and endorse renewables or do we want to recover the past of France? Unfortunately, I have the feeling that the latter one is more attractive to the audience of the electorate.”
However, alongside the re-framing of solar as an energy solution for France, and agrivoltaics as a particularly promising application, there were other positives in the announced policy, Daval noted. In particular, he said that regulatory reform to accelerate solar deployment is a big positive for the industry.
“He [Macron] talked about the administrative complexity that has to be sorted out, and the delay, which we have spent not doing much. So, there are some very positive signals.”
The first round of the French presidential election will be held on April 10.

Schneider Electric, a specialist in the digital transformation of energy management and automation, purchased a controlling stake in EnergySage, an online comparison-shopping marketplace for rooftop solar, energy storage, project financing, and community solar.
EnergySage was founded in 2009 with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Sun-Shot program, with the goal of helping to make solar and other renewable energy options affordable to all Americans.
Schneider Electric focuses on products for sustainability and efficiency including XW Pro and SW hybrid inverters, MPPT charge controllers, power distribution panels, InsightHome and InsightFacility edge devices, as well as accessories. Three years ago, Schneider Electric pulled out of the utility-scale segment in order to strengthen its profile in the residential and C&I space, hence its interest in EnergySage.
EnergySage is designed to inform smarter energy decisions through education, transparency, and choice, while helping hundreds of solar installation companies, equipment manufacturers, financiers, and service providers grow their businesses. Since its founding in 2009, EnergySage has grown and expanded–taking on new markets. In 2019 it hit the milestone of 10 million visitors, and in 2020 expanded into the community solar market.
The capital from the acquisition is expected to allow EnergySage to accelerate its growth and product innovation. In addition to growing its rooftop solar and community solar marketplace solutions for residential and commercial customers, EnergySage said it plans to develop new solutions for high-efficiency HVAC, smart home devices, and other clean energy products and services, and aims to scale its business globally.
