Chief Fire Marshal Daniel Flynn reportedly said there were at least five bikes in the apartment where the fire started. Citywide, nearly 200 blazes and six fire-related deaths this year have been tied to micromobility device batteries, marking “an exponential increase” in such fires in recent years, said Flynn. The FDNY has urged users of such batteries to follow charging and storage instructions, in addition to other safety guidance.
Saudi Arabia‘s Public Investment Fund has unveiled Ceer, the nation's first electric vehicle brand, under a joint venture with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn. Taipei-based Foxconn will develop the electric architecture for a range of Ceer models, including SUVs and sedans, with licensed component technology from BMW. The vehicles will be manufactured in Saudi Arabia and sold in the Middle East and North Africa region from 2025, according to a joint statement. The two sides claimed Ceer will attract more than $150 million of foreign direct investment and directly contribute $8 billion to Saudi Arabia’s gross domestic product by 2034.
Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar researchers have collaborated with the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) to develop a new anode material that enables lithium-ion EV batteries to be recharged within minutes. They developed the two-dimensional (2D) anode material using nanosheets derived from titanium diboride (TiB2), a material that resembles a multi-stacked sandwich, where metal atoms are present in-between layers of boron. In a paper published in ACS Applied Nanomaterials, they reported a discharge capacity of 174 mA h/g obtained at a current rate of 1 A/g within 10 minutes. They also demonstrated that the anode can sustain extremely high current rates (15 to 20 A g1–), allowing ultra-fast charging in 9–14 s, and considerable discharge capacity (50 to 60 mA h g–1) with a capacity retention of over 80% after 10,000 cycles. “It is the presence of titanium and boron atoms arranged in a carpet-like interweaved porous structure within the nanosheets that are helping in an efficient charge transport and storage,” said researcher Akash Varma.
Panasonic has started building a new EV battery manufacturing facility in De Soto, in the US state of Kansas. The facility will focus on rapidly ramping up production of “2170” cylindrical Li-ion batteries, with mass production set to begin by March 2025. Panasonic already has a US battery production site at the Tesla Gigafactory 1 in Sparks, Nevada. It is now developing new “4680” high-capacity lithium-ion batteries in Japan, with the first prototypes already shipped to Tesla. Series production is expected to start in the next fiscal year.
Britishvolt said that it has secured near-term investment to avoid financial collapse. The troubled EV battery maker said its employees have also agreed to a pay cut for November. The UK-based manufacturer had been celebrated for its plans to build a GBP 3.8 billion ($4.4 billion), 38 GWh plant in Blyth, England. Earlier this year, it secured a GBP 100 million funding commitment from the UK government, and said that total investment in the factory had reached GBP 3.8 billion, mostly from private sources. In January, Britishvolt said the first phase of the facility would begin production in the fourth quarter of 2023 or early 2024. But this past summer, it suddenly revealed that it had only raised around GBP 200 million and had pushed back its production timeline, citing “difficult external economic headwinds.”
Polestar has revealed that it has secured more than $1.6 billion in funding from major shareholders. “We have around 70,000 cars on the road today, and are on track to reach our goal of delivering 50,000 cars to customers in 2022,” said Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath. “We are making strong progress on our ambitious plans to launch three more cars by 2026.” Volvo Cars established Polestar as an EV-focused brand and is the largest institutional shareholder in the company, with a 48.3% stake.
The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) said that electric vehicles now account for 11.9% of all EU passenger car registrations, up from 9.8% in the third quarter of 2021. Hybrid electric vehicles have also gained market share, accounting for 22.6% of all sales. Despite losing market share, diesel- and petrol-powered vehicles still dominate the market, said ACEA.

The agency and the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) recently published their findings in “Decentralised Solar Electricity for Agri-food Value Chains in the Hindu Kush Himalaya Region.”
The study identifies PV-powered solutions to power key food value chains across the mountainous regions of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan. The four food value chains considered are buckwheat, yak milk, potato, and vegetables like gundruk.
For example, the report suggests using a 900 Wp solar-powered portable irrigation pump for buckwheat cultivation, which the study estimates would have a total cost of $2,000. Other PV-powered solutions include agricultural insecticide sprayers, cold storage units, and potato grading machines.
The report finds that the solutions would be technically viable, “based on the requirements and analysis of the value chains studied.” The authors claim that this conclusion “is reaffirmed by similar solutions being employed in other parts of the world.” The commercial viability of deploying these solutions, on the other hand, would “depend on government and public sector support in the form of concessional loans, tax credits and subsidies to encourage private sector investment,” according to the report.
The report makes a range of recommendations to promote the deployment of decentralized solar PV solutions in remote mountain communities, in order to guide national and sub-national planning.

It will now integrate it into the city-state’s energy management system.
SERIS said the trial showed that the system can predict island-wide irradiance up to one hour in advance, with an average error rate of less than 10%.
The model incorporates real-time irradiance data from sensors installed at various locations across Singapore, and can be combined with satellite imagery, weather data, and machine-learning algorithms. This information is aggregated to produce round-the-clock irradiance forecasting at regular intervals, from five minutes up to 24 hours ahead of time.

The trial has the support of Singapore’s Energy Market Authority (EMA), the meteorological service of Singapore, and the National Environment Agency. The EMA now plans to incorporate the model’s solar forecasts into its energy management system for the island.
“In tandem with the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and to advance Singapore’s energy transition, Singapore aims to deploy at least 2 GWp of solar capacity by 2030,” said EMA Chief Executive Ngiam Shih Chun. “A reliable solar forecasting model to predict solar irradiance, will enhance Singapore’s grid resilience and flexibility while supporting the deployment of additional solar capacity. This goes a long way in supporting our solar ambition and enhancing the resilience of our power grid.”
The EMA expects to fully incorporate the solar forecasts into its energy management system at some point in 2023. SERIS also sees potential for the model to be scaled up and applied to larger regions.
“Forecasting of solar irradiance is increasingly being required by Asian power grid operators from owners of large-scale solar power systems,” said SERIS Deputy CEO Thomas Reindl. “Therefore, the developed model has strong potential to be scaled up and commercialized to support the operations of solar farms across the region.”

“It is an open construction system, which can be adapted to all kinds of building, as well as integrate with other building components such as windows and doors,” researcher Tianyi Chen told pv magazine. “It is applicable to tall residential façades, which have a large proportion of opaque walls, especially on the western and eastern sides.”
The researchers described the system as a prefabricated, opaque, multi-layered BIPV wall. They said it offers the advantage of reducing safety risks associated with working at height on-site, along with low costs, high-performance electricity production, and fast construction.
“It also avoids exposing PV components to unfavorable weather conditions for long periods during the construction process,” said the researchers.
The plug-and-play system has a light-gauge steel structure and a male and female joint equipped with rubber tape to prevent air and rainwater penetration at the wall connection. The proposed system configuration can be installed on site, without scaffolding or mobile elevating work platforms.
“The new system ensures the high performance of PV by using a first-generation silicon-based PV module and module-level power electronic (MLPE) and by using the multi-layer wall material to create a ventilated air cavity between the PV and the main structure so that excess heat from the PV can be dissipated as quickly as possible,” said the group. “The insulation layer ensures a good thermal condition for the interior.”
Chen said the cost is about SGD 340 ($242) per square meter, including SGD 75 per square meter for the PV panels.
“The unit can generate 87.5 kWh per year per square meter and, with current electricity tariffs in Singapore, offers a payback time of roughly 13 years,” said Chen.
They presented the system in “A novel design approach to prefabricated BIPV walls for multi-storey buildings,” which was recently published in the Journal of Building Engineering.
“This solution is suitable for large public buildings if the mega panel is within the limits of the crane payload and meets the transportation logistics,” the researchers concluded. “An architect can decide the arrangement and size of the windows on the mega panel as well as the combination of material and PV modules required to meet the design needs.”
The research group includes scientists from Singapore's Solar Energy Research Institute (SERIS).

France's VSB Energies Nouvelles has started building a 9 MW solar power plant on a former gravel and sand pit, clay and kaolin extraction site in Druelle Balsac, southern France.
The project was originally supposed to have a capacity of just 5 MW.
“The project participated in a tender held by the CRE in 2016,” Jérémie Baccar, PV development manager for VSB Energies Nouvelles, told pv magazine France. “Then, during the development phase between 2016 and 2021, technological developments allowed us to almost double the installed power of the park, without changing the surface area.”
He said that about 30% of this increase resulted from the evolution of the solar modules, which reached higher power outputs.
“The Soleil de Balsac project was initially planned to have around 26,500 modules with each a power of 300 W,” said Baccar. “In its final configuration, it will have approximately 40,000 modules with each an output of 550 W, which will be provided by Chinese manufacturer GCL.”
In its final configuration, the project also benefited from its optimized layout and the inter-row spacing of the modules – a densification that facilitated a power gain of 55%.
“Important work has been carried out by our development teams to find the optimum between the shading resulting from the bringing together of the modules due to narrower rows and the gain in production obtained thanks to the increase in the number of panels on the park,” said Baccar.
VSB currently has 2 GW of solar under development. Its projects include floating arrays, agrivoltaic installations, PV carports, and large rooftop solar projects.

It all comes down to energy. Food is energy, and electricity is among our species’ greatest energy enablers. So what could be better than combining food production with solar electricity generation? The synergy of the food + energy production of an agrivoltaic facility jives in a common-sense, fundamental manner.
BayWa r.e. is deploying many plant-based agrivoltaic experiments – growing strawberries, apples, and red currents – and it has plans to develop tens of megawatts of solar facilities in the coming years. It has also been experimenting with agrivoltaic operations involving livestock, like bees and sheep.
At RE+ 2022, pv magazine USA sat down with BayWar.e.’s David Barnes, EVP of Services, to discuss the dirt beneath our solar hardware.
At its 270 MW solar power facility in Texas, BayWa r.e. was quoted approximately $275,000 each time their 1,700 acres was mowed – a job that needed to be done twice each year. If a solar field were to sell electricity under a $0.04/kWh power purchase agreement, that 13.75 million kWh/year facility could exchange roughly 2%, or 7.5 MW of its yearly electricity production for those mowing expenses. As we can see from the graph above, grazing livestock could reduce those costs by around 80%.
But here’s the kicker: The facility appears to have lost 1,035 solar modules to projectile debris, thrown by mowers as they traversed the rocky fields. That damage totaled approximately $306,000 in procurement and repair work.
So BayWa r.e. decided to study how sheep at this location could help manage the vegetation. And after several rounds of buying sheep, their flock has grown to more than 700. Sadly, it lost seven of the sheep to predators, though they have gained a few back from lambing. The company pays a shepherd to manage the sheep, and splits profits from lambs and any mutton sold.
The end result is increased electricity generation and a savings of $413,774 compared to the cost of mowing. The sheep appear to have damaged two solar modules, as compared to the 1,035 panels damaged by projectiles.
 
BayWa r.e. is now refining the number of sheep onsite. They now estimate that closer to 900 sheep will be needed to rotate the flock quickly enough to cover the entire facility, before the grass grows tall enough to shade modules. The table above demonstrates the amount of grazing required by each of the eight sections of the solar facility.
The logistics have become better defined with experience. For instance, the shepherd must check on the sheep, which takes a few hours, several times per week. And it takes up to four people to move the sheep from section to section. The herds would graze on 5 to 8 acres per day at this site.
Depending on time of year and the temperature, the sheep need approximately 600 to 1,200 gallons of water each day.
Lines distributing water from local ponds and wells were built to save on supply costs. BayWa r.e. thought that it was unwise for them to take on the responsibility and risk of providing water to the sheep, as such a task falls outside of their expertise.
Of course, some challenges remain.
Sheep draw predators. Part of the requirement for the sheep herder is to protect the sheep – typically with dogs, or a donkey. David points out that donkeys are risky – they are often stubborn animals who might kick the solar panels or racking systems.
Under the best of conditions, sheep can be challenging animals to raise. Lambing requires intensive management, often posing risks to the ewes and requiring swift veterinary intervention. The strong herd mentality of sheep has frequently been compared to the behavior of lemmings.
At another facility in Mexico, BayWa r.e. owns their own sheep and works with a shepherd  who is paid to shepherd the flock via being given the lambs. BayWa r.e. owns the sheep in Texas, paying a flat fee to their contractor for management. They’ve also been in discussions with a large group of sheep owners in North Carolina.
There is, of course, a different financial model for each of their facilities. The quantity and rotation of sheep depends on the total amount of grass that grows on a site, and several other variables.
As agrivoltaics operations evolve via government research, and small farming operations, the big-time solar developers like BayWa r.e. are leading the way for large-scale implementation.

Hover Energy, a Texas-based wind power tech company, said it will begin commercial-scale production of its residential and commercial 36 kW wind-powered microgrids at its facility in Memphis, Tennessee, in January 2023.
The Hover Array System is a rooftop-mounted microgrid combining wind, solar and energy storage with the company’s integrated energy management system (IEMS) software platform. The IEMS system integrates energy generated by both wind (alternating current) and solar (direct current) into a unified 480 V, three-phase direct drive power system to provide back-up power to building owners and residential customers.
Hover Energy’s consumer wind turbine is mounted along the windward-facing edges of the rooftop to generate continuous power throughout the day. The wind technology uses an “aerodynamic design that uses the building as a sail” to deliver commercial scale power. The company’s on-site solar panels are mounted on the rooftop center, away from the shadow of the turbine’s parapet, generating sufficient solar power during most of the daily peak afternoon hours.
Initial testing of the Hover Array System shows that the 36 kW system can offset 100% of a building’s power consumption in most cases. However, as with any microgrid system, daily time of use is the only setback to providing continuous power around the clock.
“Hover spent nearly eight years in R&D, followed by two years of rigorous testing at our installation site,” said Chris Griffin, Hover’s president and CEO.  “We know of no other wind technology that has survived two hurricanes (i.e. Ian) and is still functioning properly.”
Hover Energy has worked with RealTime Group since 2021 and Jabil since 2017. It installed its first array system on Jabil’s Strategic Development building in St. Petersburg, Florida, in 2021.
Hover Energy is by its management team and $710,000 in debt financing it raised in April 2019. In the past, Griffin served as CEO of wind turbine startup Regenedyne, and before that he spent 15 years in corporate finance at a number of Wall Street firms.

The wall-mounted battery has a nominal voltage of 51.2 Vdc and an efficiency rating of 96%. It measures 584 mm x 724 mm x 215.5 mm and weighs in at 73 kg. It also features IP65-rated protection and can reportedly operate with a depth of discharge of around 80% after 10,000 cycles. The battery is scalable by stacking up 72 devices reaching a total capacity of 358.5 kWh
The Simpliphi 6 kW inverter has an efficiency of 96.5% and a maximum DC input power of 7.5 kW. It measures 515 mm x 700 mm x 215.5 mm and has IP65-rated protection. The maximum input voltage is 600 V and the MPP voltage range is between 120 V and 550 V. The cooling system is based on natural convection. The manufacturer offers a 10-year warranty for the battery and inverter.
“Intentionally scalable, the SimpliPHI ESS can be scaled up to 9 inverters or 54 kW with up to 358.8 kWh of storage,” the spokesperson said. “Because of the broad operating temperature range and safety of the SimpliPHI LFP battery chemistry, combined with its proprietary manufacturing materials and processes, the SimpliPhi 4.9 kWh battery can be installed in a wide variety of locations and altitudes, both indoors and outdoors.”
The system's EnergyTrak monitoring system allows installers to quickly settings without having to make additional site visits.
“With the EnergyTrak gateway, our technical support engineers are able to log into the ESS app remotely and help troubleshoot and review settings real time with installers,” said the spokesperson.
Sinpliphi Power presented the product in a recent pv magazine event.

“The task force will address specific concerns raised by the EU related to the IRA,” the commission said in a statement in late October. “Both sides agreed on the importance of close coordination to support sustainable and resilient supply chains across the Atlantic, including to build the clean energy economy.”
Valdis Dombrovskis, the executive vice president of the European Commission, said the issue is a major concern for concern for many countries and businesses.
“It would appear that many of the green subsidies provided for in the act may discriminate against EU automotive, renewables, battery and energy-intensive industries,” said Dombrovskis.
According to Bloomberg, Brussels has asked the US government to remove discriminatory production requirements included in the act, as they could lead to “reciprocal or retaliatory measures.” The news outlet also reports that the European Commission is seeking an amicable solution to the matter, although it hasn't excluded the possibility of bring the matter to the World Trade Organization.
The IRA – known technically as H.R. 5376 – Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 – covers a wide range of areas, including energy- related legislation. It increased the Investment Tax Credit for renewable energy projects from 26% to 30% and extended it to all storage projects. It also includes tax credits to manufacture solar panels, inverters, and racking components. In addition, there are more tax credits for electric vehicles, electrical panels, heat pumps, and many other products directly related to the renewables industry.
