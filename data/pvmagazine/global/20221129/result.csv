The purity of hydrogen (H2) produced with membrane reactor tech is not always high enough to directly feed H2 to fuel cells, so strategies are needed to reduce the ammonia (NH3) content of the permeated hydrogen stream. The South Korean researchers applied alumina Sol, a stable colloidal solution made of boehmite, to an yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) filled porous Inconel support. “A vacuum-assisted, two-step electroless plating of Pd drastically increased the hydrogen selectivity,” the researchers said in a recent paper in Energy. They applied a highly selective Pd composite membrane to a membrane reactor with a Ru/Al2O3 catalyst to produce high-purity hydrogen by ammonia decomposition. The Pd composite membrane reactor can selectively remove hydrogen, increasing the ammonia conversion rate and high-purity hydrogen production via a one-step reaction combined with purification. They said the membrane reactor was able to achieve a high ammonia conversion (99.6%) and a high hydrogen purity (99.99%), with a hydrogen production rate of 0.25 Nm3 h−1 at 745 K and a gauge pressure of 500 kPa.
Eindhoven University of Technology, meanwhile, have presented two alternative ways to increase the purity of hydrogen produced in a membrane reactor for ammonia decomposition – by increasing the thickness of the membrane selective layer, or using a purification unit in the permeate of the membranes. They said membrane thickness above 6 micrometers (μm) of ultra-pure hydrogen can be obtained at pressures below 5 bar. Their study, published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, shows that Pd-based membranes deteriorate when exposed to temperatures higher than 500 C. “A cheaper solution, however, consists in the use of an adsorption bed downstream the membrane reactor,” the researchers wrote. “Ultra-pure hydrogen can be achieved with higher reactor pressures, lower temperatures and thinner membranes, which result in lower reactor costs.”
ACWA Power has signed a $7 billion agreement with two state-owned companies in Thailand to develop green hydrogen. ACWA Power, PTT Public Company Ltd. (PTT), and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) will conduct an investment feasibility study for proposed green hydrogen and derivatives projects. They aim to produce around 225,000 tons of green hydrogen per year, said ACWA Power.
HDF Energy and US International Development Finance Corp. (DFC) have agreed to support the development of green hydrogen plants in Indonesia. The facilities will use HDF Energy's technology, Renewstable, which combines renewable sources and mass. The French company said that DFC's technical assistance will support feasibility studies for its pipeline of 22 Renewstable projects in Indonesia, for an investment of $1.5 billion, backed by development institutions.
Rolls-Royce and EasyJet claim to have pulled off the “world's first run of a modern aero engine on hydrogen.” The companies performed the ground test in the United Kingdom with a converted Rolls-Royce AE 2100-A regional aircraft engine and hydrogen generated by renewables in the Orkney Islands. “Following analysis of this early concept ground test, the partnership plans a series of further rig tests leading up to a full-scale ground test of a Rolls-Royce Pearl 15 jet engine,” wrote the automaker.

Shenzhen Energy has unveiled plans to build a 2 GW solar-storage project in Shule county, Xinjiang region. The first 500 MW phase will require an investment of CNY3.4 billion, with construction set to start “soon,” according to the company.
The National Energy Administration (NEA) has urged network operators to ensure grid connections for new solar and wind projects by the end of the year. The NEA said it will allow connections in batches and said that the completion of construction will not be necessary to request grid connection. The move will make it easier to deploy more renewable energy capacity in the final weeks of the year.
Jinko Power said the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has approved its private offering of up to 868 million new shares. The chairman of Jinko Power, Li Xiande, is also the controlling shareholder of module manufacturer JinkoSolar. Jinko Power is independent from Jinko Solar and operates in the PV project development and construction segment.

The association said that network operators suggested the change to enable congestion service providers (CSPs) to begin acting as intermediaries, in order to make optimal use of the available space on the network.
Under the new rules, grid operators will be allowed to make agreements with market entities about how often and for what fee they help to reduce the peak. The CSPs will act as independent services providers between the network operator and connected customers.
“The CSPs should balance production, storage, and demand in such a way, that very expensive new grid infrastructure should not be built,” solar analyst Peter Segaar told pv magazine. “These companies must facilitate optimal usage of existing capacities and will act as intermediate parties to balance temporary surpluses in demand as well as for local production of energy.”
The Netherlands urgently needs to address grid constraints, as high volumes of solar capacity will be deployed in the years ahead. Over the past two years, Dutch power supplier Liander has implemented a number of measures to increase grid capacity in several areas facing grid constraints, which are preventing more renewables from going online. These measures include the deployment of two giant transformers and congestion management for grid bottlenecks.
More recently, Dutch electricity transmission system operator Tennet said it would invest €13 billion ($13.3 billion) to expand the national high-voltage grid. The plan includes the construction of 40 new onshore high-voltage stations across every province.
In January 2019, Tennet and Enexis warned for the first time that there was extremely limited capacity for more solar in the provinces of Groningen, Drenthe and Overijssel. Three months later, the two companies said they would boost the connection capacity available for solar over the next few years, particularly in the country’s less densely populated east.

The new blueplanet NX3 M2 product range includes six different versions with outputs of 3.0 kVA, 5.0 kVA, 8.0 kVA, 10.0 kVA, 15.0 kVA, and 20.0 kVA. The smallest device has an efficiency of 97.3% and a European efficiency rating of 95.8%, while the largest device has an efficiency of 97.8% and a European efficiency rating of 97.5%.
All of the devices measure 435 mm x 503 mm x 183 mm. The 3.0 kVA and 5.0 kVA variants, which are designed for small residential rooftop applications, weigh less than 16 kg, while the commercial devices weigh 18 kg.
The residential inverters have two maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs, each with a load capacity of 6,200 W and an operating range of 270 V to 850 V. The commercial inverters have two MPPTs with a load capacity of 12,000 W and an operating range of 400 V to 850 V.
The M3 product range includes three different versions with outputs of 25.0 kVA, 30.0 kVA, and 33.0 kVA. The largest device has an efficiency of 98.0% and a European efficiency rating of 97.6%. The M3 series has three MPPT inputs, each with a load capacity between 37,500 W and 49, 500 W and an operating range of 450 V to 850 V.
All the inverters are equipped with IP65 protection and active cooling. They can be used in projects at altitudes of up to 3,000 meters and with ambient operating temperatures ranging from -25 C to 60 C.
Kaco New Energy said the devices are designed for east-west-facing rooftops, or contorted architectural designs.
“If required, the trackers will work in parallel and process double the current,” the company explained. “Thus, dimensioning arrays with high powered PV modules facing south is just as simple.”
It said the inverters can be used for new projects and to repower PV applications. The NX3 line is certified in more than 20 European countries and international markets, including Israel and Jordan.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/29/perovskites-and-microgrooves-can-revolutionize-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM",,"NOVEMBER 29, 2022",Perovskites and microgrooves can revolutionize solar,"As solar becomes an increasingly large proportion of the energy mix, there’s a problem with the dominance of silicon in panel production. Silicon accounts for 95% of the 14 GW of solar module generation capacity installed in the UK. That solar fleet provides just 4% of the UK’s energy demand. The government’s 2022 energy strategy calls for a five-fold increase in solar capacity, to 70 GW, by 2035. However, looking to silicon solar for the additional 56 GW presents significant ethical, economic, and security implications and that prospect is driving research into alternatives, which is where perovskites come in.
Manufacturing silicon panels is costly and complicated and, as the UK does not have significant silicon solar manufacturing capacity, we will continue to rely on imports. As the world has learnt of late, geographical concentration of global supply chains presents energy security and logistics challenges. Manufacturing solar panels has a high carbon footprint and the average carbon payback period for a silicon solar panel – the length of time a panel will have to generate electricity before it cancels out the carbon emissions its manufacture embodies – sits at 300 days to 350 days.
Also, the rigidity and bulk of silicon solar panels typically limits their application to ground-mounted solar farms and installation on load-bearing roofs. For example, a gigawatt of solar generation capacity requires around 2.5 million panels. To achieve the 70 GW required by 2035 is going to take a massive land grab. Little wonder the International Energy Agency is calling for diversification in solar PV manufacturing.
There has long been interest in the potential use of perovskites for solar power generation, thanks to the superconducting and electronic properties observed in the crystal, which is found in abundance in the Earth’s mantle. The fact cheaply available perovskites have remarkable properties for absorbing light photons to create an electron flow and generate electricity position the material as an ideal candidate to supplant silicon in solar generation.
With so much interest in perovskites, enterprizing manufacturers are looking for innovative ways to incorporate them into PV production and my company, Power Roll, is no exception. We have patented a technique that applies perovskites to a flexible, lightweight substrate: polyethylene terephthalate (PET) – an industrial thermoplastic sheet. The PET substrate is embossed with tiny v-shaped channels or “microgrooves” that are no more than one or two microns wide.
The microgrooves are printed extremely accurately onto the heat-stabilized PET using a roll-to-roll process. They form conductive pathways that are designed to optimize the flow of electrons and “tune” the electrical output of the solar module. The walls of the microgrooves are coated with metals, as the electrodes, followed by an oxide layer that acts as the electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL). The perovskite ink is printed into the grooves over the ETL/HTL layers to produce an ultra-thin, flexible solar cell, or “solar film” that is 100 times thinner than silicon solar panels.
Roll-to-roll manufacturing is a simple and scalable process used in other low-cost sectors such as packaging, and is key to the low cost of solar film. Importantly, it skips several production steps involved in other flexible PV technologies.
After perovskite ink coating and annealing – the latter a heating process to aid pliability – a pressure adhesive barrier film is applied over the top in a continuous process to protect the crystallized perovskite. Further barrier films and a foil back sheet can be applied using either pressure or vacuum lamination.
To research cost-to-durability ratios, Power Roll has performed weekly tests on various barrier films and lamination types that have been exposed to outside conditions over the last six months. This has demonstrated that films with high cost-barriers and vacuum lamination show no degradation of performance while those with low cost-barriers and pressure lamination have been affected at the edges. Further testing is ongoing.
Power Roll’s methodology produces perovskite PV with a manufacturing cost five times cheaper – and a carbon payback period up to ten times shorter – than traditional silicon solar panels.
The combination of microgrooves and perovskites produces flexible, lightweight, efficient solar film at a fraction of the cost of silicon solar panels. The flexible nature and simple installation process means that perovskite solar film can be installed in situations where silicon solar panels cannot be deployed. For example, it can be integrated with windows, blinds, vehicles, low-load bearing roofs, and vertical surfaces. While solar panel farms take up significant amounts of green space, perovskite PV can make use of areas that have already been developed for commercial or domestic use.
The largest market for solar film is in commercial and industrial rooftops. Just a quarter of the UK’s 2.5 billion square meters of south-facing rooftops could generate 30% of the UK’s energy requirement. Perovskite PV solar film can be installed on non-structural rooftop space cheaply and at scale, helping the UK meet its energy security and net-zero goals.
And opportunities for lightweight solar film extend beyond the UK. The manufacturing process is easy to replicate and can be licensed globally, to help accelerate solar energy deployment. With less than 2% of global rooftops hosting solar installations, there is a massive opportunity for lightweight, low-cost perovskite PV. Solar film is versatile and has the potential to be integrated on rooftops and across a wide range of surfaces. It will help improve the accessibility of clean energy generation in areas of the world that are currently lacking any significant renewables infrastructure. Perovskite PV is expected to come to market as soon as next year, with wider adoption by 2025, and promises to revolutionize the solar sector.

Gravitricity, a Scottish energy storage specialist, has launched a project to demonstrate the feasibility of its gravity energy storage technology for grid balancing in India, as the nation has a growing share of renewables in its power mix.
The company has secured GBP 194,000 ($232,750) from the UK government’s Ayrton Fund to find a demonstration site in India for its gravity energy storage technology. The Ayrton Fund, which is part of the UK’s International Climate Finance commitment, aims to give developing countries access to the latest cutting-edge tech to help reduce their emissions and meet global climate change targets.
Gravitricity has developed a gravity-based energy storage system that works by raising heavy weights (up to 12,000 tons) in a deep shaft and then releasing them when energy is required. The gravity storage technology could be ideal for India, which aims to install more than 500 GW of renewables by 2030, up from 100 GW in 2021. This rapid increase in variable renewables generation – much of it solar – will bring with it a need for energy storage.
Gravitricity claims its system can operate for up to 50 years and store energy at half the cost of lithium-ion batteries. In India, it has partnered with Panitek Power on the 12-month project, which aims to identify and shortlist sites for a demonstration scheme.
Gravity storage is a relatively simple technology. It doesn’t rely on any rare earth metals, and has a very long lifespan, so it can be manufactured and deployed locally, said Chris Yendell, project development manager at Gravitricity.

Australia’s Northern Territory is set to have its first big battery operating in 2023 – the 34.7 MW / 34.7 MWh Darwin-Katherine Battery Energy Storage System (DK BESS), which is now being built at the Channel Island Power Station in Darwin. The big battery’s capacity looks modest, but it’s worth noting that the Northern Territory has a population of just 247,000.
Switzerland-based Hitachi Energy, which won a territorial government tender in Dec. 2021, is delivering the battery with Virtual Synchronous Machine. The grid-forming technology gives batteries the capacity to help stabilize the grid by providing inertia and frequency control services, which have only been provided by gas or coal-fired generators until recently.

Hitachi has already deployed the technology in Australia with Hitachi ABB Power Grids in use at South Australia’s 30 MW/ 8 MWh Dalrymple battery. Hitachi Energy Country Managing Director Bernard Norton described the deployment as “a bold step toward operating the entire Darwin-Katherine network without gas powered generators.”
Norton is gesturing toward the end vision for the Darwin-Katherine battery which, being built at the site of a 279 MW gas facility, the Channel Island Power Station, is a step towards eventually replacing the fossil-fuel generation.
DK BESS is expected to unlock more capacity for residential and industrial solar and save 58,000 tons of carbon emissions per year. The battery is expected to generate cost savings of $6.6 million and pay for itself in just under five years. It will feed into the Darwin-Katherine Interconnected System, which services 150,000 people in the Northern Territory.
Gerhard Laubscher, CEO of Territory Generation, the territory-owned company behind the Channel Island Power Station, said Hitachi Energy already has a team mobilized to the site to conduct specialist battery equipment and cabling installation.
Hitachi is working with local contractor ESPEC to deliver the battery, while Western Australian company Pacific Energy Group will supply and install the 11.5 kV switchroom via its subsidiary, MVLV Power Solutions.
The DK BESS has been described as the “cornerstone investment” of Territory Generation’s Fleet Transition, with the project also a major part of the Darwin-Katherine Electricity System Plan.
“Construction of the Darwin-Katherine BESS is a huge step forward in our plan for 50% renewables by 2030,” said Northern Territory Minister for Renewables and Energy, Selena Uibo.

“We also show that in Mediterranean countries, FPV can already economically compete with traditional LPV, because of the sun’s higher position and the higher temperatures in these locations,” researcher Leonardo Micheli told pv magazine. “However, FPV becomes cost competitive in all the modeled scenarios and countries if capital costs are reduced by less than 12%.”
The scientists estimated Europe's potential FPV capacity by using the water surface data available for Europe in the Global Reservoir and Dam Database (GRanD). They only considered reservoirs used for hydroelectricity, water supplies, irrigation, and flood control. They simulated the energy yields of monofacial modules by using the PVWatts DC power model, with data on hourly irradiance from CAMS Radiation Service.
For the FPV applications, the model considered scenarios with 10-degree and 20-degree tilt angles and an albedo of 0.06. The tilt angle on LPV was assumed to be optimal, and the albedo 0.25. Both simulations used Trina Solar modules with 21.4% efficiency, inverters with an efficiency of 96%, and DC to AC losses of 14%. All modules were south oriented, and the PV system lifetime was set at 25 years. The scientists sourced data from the IRENA Renewable Cost Database to calculate the capex and yearly operation and maintenance expenditure (omex) for different locations across Europe.
The study looked at the performance of FPV and LPV in four thermal scenarios. The results showed that FPV systems can produce a yield of between 640 and 1688 kWh/kW/year, corresponding to capacity factors of 7.3% to 19.3%.
“The higher yields are found, unexpectedly, in the Southernmost countries, where the solar potential is higher and the angular and reflection losses due to the lower tilt angles are limited,” the researchers said.
The worst performances are found in the Scandinavia and the alpine regions of Switzerland, Austria, and Italy. In the most optimistic thermal exchange scenario, FPV electrical performance is highest and returns yields up to 2% higher than LPV.
“In this scenario, 20-degree tilt FPV grants higher yields than optimally tilted LPV in several countries. In other configurations and scenarios, however, the yields of FPV are typically lower than those of LPV, especially at 10- degree tilt,” the researchers said. “These results highlight that the effect of the tilt angles on the energy conversion is significant.”
The study estimates that each additional degree of tilt angle in FPV installations is worth between €2.50 ($2.62)/kW and €7.50/kW.
Given these differences in energy yield, FPV's competitiveness on levelized cost of energy (LCOE) depends on allowances for capex and omex. In general, results show that LPV’s LCOE would be competitive in most European countries across all scenarios if racking and mounting costs are eliminated. If grid-connection costs are also eliminated – for example, via the hybridization with hydropower – FPV could be cost-competitive in all countries, in all modeled scenarios.
The research group shared its findings in “Techno-economic potential and perspectives of floating photovoltaics in Europe,” which was recently published in Solar Energy. The group includes researchers from the University of Jaén in Spain and the University of Catania in Italy.

It said the new provisions will go into force within 15 days from publication in the country's official gazette.
The new provisions introduce the possibility for distributed renewable energy system owners to be remunerated for up to 30% of the surplus power they inject into the grid.
“The DER rules include guidelines, interconnection standards, Certificate of Compliance (COC) requirements, pricing methodologies, commercial arrangements governing the sale of energy produced and operations of the DER and payment of subsidies, among others,” the ERC said.
Since 2008, the Philippines has only allowed net metering for renewable energy systems below 100 kW in size. However, the scheme has failed to provide significant growth. Most of the existing rooftop PV capacity in the Philippines was actually deployed through a feed-in tariff system, which has now expired.
The Philippines plans to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030. Recent statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency show that the country had an installed PV capacity of 1.08 GW by the end of 2021.

Fusion Fuel, a modular solar-to-hydrogen specialist based in Portugal, and Electus Energy, a hydrogen infrastructure developer, have signed a deal to jointly build a 75 MW green hydrogen facility in Bakersfield, California.
The proposed project is a solar-to-hydrogen site that would make use of Fusion Fuel’s proprietary HEVO hydrogen electrolyzer technology. It said the facility, its first in the United States, would produce up to 9,300 tons of hydrogen fuel per year to fuel heavy-duty trucks.
Fusion Fuel’s HEVO technology features a miniaturized electrolyzer, fixed to the back of concentrated solar power (CSP) panel. It uses PV electricity and thermal energy. The technology also uses dual-axis trackers to follow the sun throughout the day.
“By integrating the HEVO directly to the CPV module, not only are we able to utilize the electrical energy to power the electrochemical reaction without transport or conversion losses, but we can also recover that wasted thermal energy and use it to pre-heat the feed water, reducing the electrical load required to split water by roughly 10%,” said Fusion Fuel.
The companies will invest about $180 million to launch the 75 MW project. They aim to make a final investment decision in early 2024, with project commissioning scheduled for early 2025. Once operational, the project will provide enough hydrogen fuel to support more than 1,000 Class 8 trucks or buses per day.
Electus Energy has been actively developing hydrogen mobility solutions in the southwestern United States by cultivating relationships with prospective offtakers in the logistics and distribution sector. The partnership with Fusion Fuel could mark the beginning of a “hydrogen highway” vision for the region, linking California to Texas through a chain of green hydrogen fueling stations.
“Bakersfield will be the first anchor project of our U.S. strategy, which is heavily focused on the hydrogen mobility and logistics opportunity and envisions a hydrogen highway from California to Texas,” said Jason Baran, chief commercial officer at Fusion Fuel. “While our HEVO-Solar technology is best suited for markets with high solar irradiance, the expected introduction in 2024 of our newest product – HEVO-Chain – will make the entirety of North America part of our addressable market.”

Mono ingots and wafers for PV applications are manufactured with seeded cast silicon, which is also known as cast-mono or quasi-mono crystalline silicon. The cast mono process facilitates the production of “mono like” wafer materials using a modified multicrystalline furnace, while avoiding costly investment in ingot pulling machinery. Cast-mono wafers are less susceptible to recombination caused by boron-oxygen defects and have the advantage of lower light-induced degradation.
“Our goal in this work was to increase the tolerance of side multi-crystalline grains' inward growth and to keep the stable monocrystalline ratio with narrower edges,” said researcher Shuai Yuan. “Our new method should help industrial casting manufacturers to improve the comprehensive cost performance of the casting ingots.”
They took photoluminescence (PL) mapping photos of vertical sections of a normal cast mono–crystalline ingot (Ingot A), and the composite silicon made of CM-Si and HPM-Si (Ingot B). They found that the defects in the central nine bricks of ingot B were better controlled, which purportedly shows that the quality of the bricks in Ingot B is close to those of normal HPM-Si and CZ-Si bricks.
“In other words, the yield of cast monocrystalline silicon can be ensured, and the overall cost is remarkably reduced,” said the scientists. “This work introduces a method of fabricating composite cast silicon ingots containing monocrystalline and high-performance multicrystalline bricks.”
They described the new manufacturing process in “Higher quality composite silicon ingot with monocrystalline and multicrystalline bricks,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.
Cast mono manufacturing emerged at the start of the decade, but its importance has faded due to a lack of production line capacity. However, with more efficient monocrystalline panels surpassing multi as the industry standard, multicrystalline producers have returned to cast mono technology.
In 2019, Canadian Solar said that it had achieved 22.8% efficiency for its p-type multicrystalline P5 solar cell, based on mono cast technology. Just a few months earlier, rival GCL Systems Integration unveiled cast mono tech modules with 18.9% efficiency.

The novelty of the methodology consists of providing not only the amount of energy that must be reserved or shifted locally for balancing purposes within a day, but also the required duration of energy reserving or shifting.
“The developed method distinguishes between power and energy fluctuations of PV systems,” the academics said. “The quantification of the power fluctuations only requires technical characteristics and time series with the measured power values of the PV systems.”
The proposed method is based on analyses of the so-called power ramp, which the researchers describe as the difference in power values between two successive points in time in a PV system. The three steps consist of the classification of the days with PV generation in the “low variability” and “high variability,” the computation of the distribution of PV power ramps, and the calculation of PV energy fluctuations.
This method computes power ramps at each point in time and the energy fluctuations on a daily basis. “Because the PV power prediction uncertainties are summed over the day, the computed daily energy fluctuations can be compared to the capacity of the local flexibility sources to estimate whether the available flexibility sources have a sufficient amount of energy to balance the daily energy fluctuations,” they further explained.
The research group tested its method in seven PV systems with a capacity ranging from 1.2 kW to 100 kW, located in either northern or southern Germany. Through this analysis, it found that days with high variability and those with low variability feature characteristic distributions of PV power ramps. “The computed distributions of the power ramps enable the magnitudes of power fluctuations that arise most frequently in a given PV system to be estimated,” it said. “In other words, based on the computed distributions, the probability of any power ramp of any PV system can be determined for the given variability class.”
The researchers said the testing showed that PV installations located in the same area should have similar distributions of power ramps. “However, all of the investigated PV systems are located in Germany in western Europe. It may be academically interesting to apply the developed method to PV systems in other locations with apparently differing climate and weather conditions,” they stated.
The researchers also claim the new approach can support adequate dimensioning of the PV system in buildings and be integrated into energy management systems for scheduling the operation for the next day.
They described the novel methodology in the paper “Quantifying power and energy fluctuations of photovoltaic systems,” published in Energy Science & Engineering. “The proposed methodology for quantifying PV energy fluctuations can be applied to any PV system if solar radiation predictions for its particular location and technical parameters are available,” they concluded.

The country is expected to add around 500 MW of new solar capacity, from 944 MW last year, according to the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA-PVPS), which recently published a report on PV applications in Canada.
“If we look at the recent averages, Canada has installed around 500 MW annually. I expect in 2022 it will be at least 500 MW,” said Yves Poissant, research manager at Canmet Energy. “Last year it was 944 MW, mainly because of a 465 MW centralized PV power plant installed in Alberta.”
The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) studied renewables integration and concluded that Canada’s cumulative solar capacity will increase sevenfold to 35 GW by 2050, driven by cost competitiveness.
Canada now produces 80% of its electricity from power sources other than oil. Hydroelectricity leads the mix at 60%, followed by nuclear at 15%, wind at 7%, gas and coal at 7%, and PV at just 1%. While the government aims to increase the share of green electricity to 90% by 2030 and 100% by 2050, it has not set any specific goals for PV. Each Canadian province and territory is left to determine its own targets.
“Without comprehensive pan-Canadian policy framework with annual capacity targets, PV installation in the coming years will likely continue to be highly variable across the provinces and territories. Further policies mechanisms are needed to allow PV to reach its full potential,” the IEA-PVPS said.
Canada recently introduced investment tax credits for renewables to compete with the United States, but it is still far from being a solar powerhouse. That said, the landscape has started to change in the past five years.
“Some laws have been put in place to retire coal plants by 2025. That led to new opportunities to install capacity,” said Poissant. “We expect the newly installed capacity will consist mostly of wind, but also solar.”
The cost of solar has become more competitive and the residential sector is now close to grid parity, according to Poissant. For utility-scale projects, old hydroelectric dams are still considerably cheaper than solar, but newly built installations are now more expensive than solar.
“Starting 2030, solar PV will be cost competitive compared to wind,” Poissant said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/29/italy-deployed-1-6-gw-of-pv-in-january-september-period/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 29, 2022",Italy deployed 1.6 GW of PV in January-September period,"Italy reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 24.2 GW at the end of September, according to a new quarterly update by Italian state-owned energy agency GSE.
The agency said that 1,612 MW of PV systems were installed in Italy in the first nine months of the year.
“The growth, which follows eight years of relative stability in the PV sector, affects all plant typologies, all regions, and the main cities of the country,” the GSE said. 
Around 32 MW of this year's new capacity came from PV systems below 3 kW in size and 705 MW from installations ranging in size from 3 kW to 30 kW. GSE said that solar arrays with capacities  between 200 kW and 1 MW reached 467 MW and projects above 1 MW reached 408 MW.
If the current growth trend is confirmed, more than 2 GW of newly installed PV capacity could come online in the country this year. The Italian government is currently supporting large-scale solar via an auction system and rooftop solar through net metering and several fiscal incentives.
