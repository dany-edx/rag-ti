“The newest version of EnerVenue’s batteries extends the solutions’ durability, operational flexibility, and cost-efficiency benefits for stationary storage projects across myriad use cases,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The next-generation ESVs can flexibly cycle up to three times per day, at two to 12-hour discharge rates, enabling unique applications and business models for developers, integrators, and owners.”
The battery has reportedly a 30-year, 30,000-cycle lifespan, with the manufacturer offering a 20-year/20,000-cycle warranty that guarantees at least 88% battery capacity remaining after that period.
EnerVenue claims its nickel-hydrogen battery technology can operate at temperatures between -40 C and 60 C. It can also provide the promised cycles without degradation and at varying rates, for a wide range of fast and slow charging capabilities.
The battery has an efficiency ranging from 80% to 90%, depending on the cycle rate, and its energy density per square foot is equal to, or better than lithium-ion batteries, according to the company.
In May, EnerVenue conducted UL 9540A evaluations for thermal runaway fire propagation at the cell, module, and unit level. The company certified its Energy Storage Vessels to UL 1973, said EnerVenue CTO Majid Keshavarz. He said the UL 9540A test results validate the company's battery chemistry as the top choice for customers aiming to eliminate fire or thermal hazards in their grid-scale installations.
The nickel-hydrogen battery technology is particularly good in remote and harsh conditions with operational temperatures ranging between -40 C to 60 C, as demonstrated by its use in NASA satellites.
EnerVenue raised $125 million in a December 2021 Series A equity offering from Schlumberger, Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures, and Stanford University. It was advised by Barclays. The funding round followed another $12 million seed round earlier that year.
In March, EnerVenue announced plans to invest in a gigafactory in the US state of Kentucky, where it will design, manufacture and test its nickel-hydrogen Energy Storage Vessels. It reports that it has more than 7 GWh of customer commitments, including orders from Pine Gate Renewables, Nicon Industries’ Green Energy Renewable Solutions unit, and Schlumberger New Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/07/key-takeaways-from-brazils-intersolar-south-america-trade-show/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,EVENTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,BRAZIL",LÍVIA NEVES,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2023",Key takeaways from Brazil’s Intersolar South America trade show,"From pv magazine Brazil
The 10th edition of Intersolar South America hosted 530 exhibitors and attracted 50,000 visitors over three days, marking substantial growth from the 2022 show, which had 400 exhibitors and 44,000 visitors.
Throughout the fair last week, there was a noticeable mix of caution and enthusiasm among participants. The Brazilian solar market is anticipated to experience limited growth in 2023, marking a departure from years of exponential expansion. Nonetheless, achieving a feat like the previous year, adding 11 GW, would still position the country as one of the world's major PV markets this year.
In 2022, a total of 8.2 GW of distributed generation and 2.5 GW of centralized generation were added. By August of this year, an additional 8 GW of solar capacity had already been installed, comprising 5.2 GW of distributed generation and 2.8 GW of centralized generation.
Sources told pv magazine that Brazil is expected to see a continuation of this level of new installations in 2024, with growth to recover in 2025. Over the long term, there is still a lot of room for the expansion of solar, which currently accounts for 15% of the national electricity mix, with more than 23.2 GW of distributed-generation PV and 10.4 GW of utility-scale capacity.
Although sales of small rooftop systems declined in the first half of the year, the market for larger distributed generation projects is heating up. Power plants exceeding 75 kW can still be connected until the start of 2024 under the previous regulation (prior to Law 14,300), which offers more favorable terms for shared generation projects involving multiple consumers.
Collective projects generally fall within this category, and while they currently represent only 2.67% of distributed-generation PV installed capacity (622 MW out of 23.2 GW), they already account for 9.88% of consumer units receiving credits (300 thousand out of 3 million). Brazilian consultancy Greener estimates that this segment has the potential to attract BRL 40 billion ($8.0 million) by the end of 2024.
Market consolidation 
The smaller distributed solar generation sector, traditionally leading the Brazilian market with 18 GW of systems installed up to 74.99 kW, faces a significant challenge due to a lack of competitive financing and intense price pressure. This situation arises from the recent reduction in module costs, which has led to a surplus of inventory estimated at between 2 GW and 4 GW among equipment distributors.
Fernando Castro, JA Solar's country manager, notes that the decline in module prices, from approximately $0.25/W a year ago to $0.16/W today, has put pressure on equipment distributors who purchased modules at higher prices. They are now compelled to sell at lower costs, often resulting in negative profit margins.
This challenging scenario may trigger consolidation and a reduction in the number of distributors and integrators within the sector. To navigate this period successfully, companies will need to professionalize their operations and innovate to offer new solutions to end consumers.
Manufacturers, distributors, and companies in the sector showcased a diverse range of offerings at Intersolar, aligning with concepts like the energy ecosystem and integrated energy solutions. In addition to photovoltaic generation, they presented products such as batteries, electric vehicle chargers, and services encompassing management, monitoring, and optimization.
Although Brazil currently lacks a highly competitive business case for batteries, experts consulted by pv magazine anticipate a shift in approximately two years. Module manufacturers such as JA Solar, Canadian Solar, and Jinko Solar have already introduced storage systems, with Jinko Solar supplying batteries to three small-scale projects in the country. The rural consumer segment is expected to be an early adopter of this technology, supported by accessible credit options and the need for improved energy supply quality.
Absolar CEO Rodrigo Sauaia pointed to the significant tax burden on batteries, exceeding 80% and rendering the market unviable. He noted the potential for regulatory recognition and remuneration for ancillary services, which could incentivize broader battery adoption, enabling services like distribution network management.
Intersolar South America is also embracing these new technologies for future growth, as it announced plans for a new pavilion and a dedicated pillar for electric mobility in the 2024 edition.
“By 2024, The smarter E South America will have four pillars: solar generation, batteries and storage systems, energy management and electric mobility,” said Florian Wessendorf, the general director of Solar Promotion International. “We are going to launch Power2Drive, which will have the fair, conferences and technical workshops.” 
Local manufacturing 
Distributors are diversifying their offerings, including their own assembly structures and trackers, providing solar kits that can be financed through Finame, offered by the Brazilian development bank, BNDES, with imported modules.
Companies such as Fortlev, based in Espírito Santo, introduced a new ballast solar assembly structure made of polyethylene, promising a 50% reduction in construction time for ground or slab-based installations. Sou Energy, based in Ceará, showcased fixation structures made of fiberglass-reinforced polyester. MTR, a distributor specializing in systems ranging from 1 MW to 5 MW, presented their in-house manufactured fixed structures, skids, and trackers located in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais.
Amid discussions about the development of the local industry and which links in the chain should be prioritized for competitiveness, two new factories were announced at the fair. Trina Tracker is establishing a photovoltaic tracker factory in Salvador (BA) to expand supply options with imported modules. Livoltek, also a Chinese manufacturer, is setting up a new inverter factory in Manaus (AM).
Regarding local production, Rodrigo Sauaia, CEO of Absolar, noted the country's potential to become a manufacturing hub for the production chain, emphasizing the importance of avoiding artificial barriers and maintaining reduced import taxes.

India's Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has approved the VGF scheme for BESS development. The approved scheme envisages the development of 4 GWh of BESS projects by 2030-31, with financial support of up to 40% of the project’s capital cost in the form of VGF. The move is expected to bring down the cost of battery storage systems, increasing their viability.
The VGF for the development of the BESS scheme has an initial outlay of around $1.13 billion. By offering VGF support, the scheme targets achieving a levelized cost of storage (LCoS) ranging from INR 5.50/kWh to INR 6.60/kWh, making stored renewable energy a viable option for managing peak power demand across the country. The VGF shall be disbursed in five tranches linked with the various stages of BESS project implementation.
To guarantee consumer access to the scheme's advantages, BESS projects will allocate a minimum of 85% of their capacity to electricity distribution companies (discoms). This approach will bolster renewable energy integration into the electricity grid, curbing wastage and optimizing transmission network utilization. Consequently, it will diminish the necessity for expensive infrastructure upgrades.
The selection of BESS developers for VGF grants will follow a transparent, competitive bidding process, fostering equitable opportunities for both public and private sector entities.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/07/bringing-the-benefits-of-affordable-ev-charging-points-to-apartment-blocks/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE,NORWAY",,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2023",Bringing the benefits of affordable EV charging points to apartment blocks,"In the pursuit of a cleaner and more sustainable future, the adoption of EVs has emerged as a significant milestone. Europe is witnessing a surge in EV adoption, driven by the promise of reduced emissions and a greener transportation ecosystem. However a key hurdle remains: the establishment of widespread and accessible EV charging infrastructure. A large share of Europeans live in multi-apartment complexes where the installation of charging facilities is far from straightforward.
Image: Elaway
While EV charging set-ups are relatively uncomplicated for residents of detached houses, people in multi-unit complexes face a more intricate scenario. Multi-home buildings often have car parks that can accommodate many vehicles and even if there are only a few EVs right now, it is important to get a scalable infrastructure in place from the start so that more drivers can be added over time. The need for system charging – where chargers work together to optimize energy distribution – combined with the management oversight provided by a charge-point management system (CPMS), adds further complexity to the equation.
At Elaway, we recognize a substantial barrier to progress regarding financing of the fundamental charging infrastructure needed for system charging in housing communities. This obstacle poses a chicken-and-egg dilemma. Without adequate infrastructure, EV adoption rates may stagnate as residents lack the convenience of home charging – one of the primary advantages of EV ownership. With only a small percentage of today’s EV owners living in housing communities, however, willingness to contribute to finance charging infrastructure remains limited. It can be a self-perpetuating cycle. Most residents who drive fossil-fuelled cars are unwilling to pay for EV infrastructure. With almost half of Europe's population living in multi-apartment complexes – according to EU statistical body Eurostat – appropriate charging infrastructure is a major challenge that needs to be addressed to ensure the uptake of EVs by people in such buildings.
A successful model can be observed in Norway, a leader in the EV market. The Norwegian EV Association estimates electric vehicles have a market share of more than 80% of new cars sold and EVs now make up more than 20% of the total car fleet. The success is, in part, because Norway has pioneered a solution to the financing challenge. The Nordic state has mandatory regulations for housing communities to provide EV charging, coupled with a stipulation that entire communities share the financial responsibility for charging infrastructure. This proactive approach has propelled the swift expansion of EV charging facilities in multi-home communities.
Addressing this intricate challenge necessitates innovative solutions and external catalysts. This is where EU legislators can play a transformative role. By introducing incentives and progressive regulations, they can facilitate the development of EV charging infrastructure in housing communities.
Elaway has been providing EV charging solutions for housing communities in Norway since 2019 and is now one of the leading players in this segment of the Norwegian market, which is a few years ahead of all other European countries. We have experimented with different business models to test what creates traction in the market and our experience is that offering apartment communities the opportunity to rent charging facilities significantly lowers the finance barrier. Elaway's approach to incentivizing charging infrastructure installation showcases a promising path forward. Our model offers customers the flexibility to purchase or rent charging facilities, catering to a wider spectrum of financial situations. This creative financing solution could act as a catalyst, encouraging more multi-home communities to embark on the EV charging journey.
To address the EV charging challenge legislatively, EU policymakers could focus on the following strategies.
Infrastructure-focused incentives: Shifting the focus of incentives from individual chargers or vehicles to charging infrastructure could inspire multi-home communities to invest collectively, acknowledging the collective benefits for all residents.
Mandatory EV charging provision: Copying Norway's approach and mandating housing communities to offer EV charging could accelerate the roll-out of charging facilities in housing communities across Europe.
Community-funded installation: Introducing policies that ensure entire housing communities contribute to financing installation, rather than relying on a small subset of early adopters, would secure sufficient funds and establish a fair and sustainable model for EV charging expansion in such communities.
Incentivizing infrastructure ownership and renting: Recognizing the varying financial capacity of multi-apartment communities, EU policymakers could extend incentives to both owned and rented charging infrastructure, accommodating diverse financial scenarios.
Aligning policies with the recommendations above, the EU could emerge as a driving force behind the accelerated deployment of EV charging infrastructure in multi-home communities. Legislative endeavors have the potential to bridge the financing gap, surmounting the challenge of limited EV adoption that is being hampered by inadequate charging facilities. A concerted effort could pave the way for a harmonious environment where electric mobility flourishes, emissions dwindle, and a sustainable future becomes a tangible reality.
At Elaway, we firmly believe that by uniting industry players and policymakers, we can steer Europe towards a future powered by clean and efficient transportation.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/07/anode-less-redox-flow-batteries-capable-of-fast-cycling/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2023",Anode-less redox flow batteries capable of fast cycling,"Redox flow batteries that incorporate solid energy-storing materials are attractive for high-capacity grid-scale energy storage due to their high theoretical energy densities. However, their practical implementation is held back by low rate capability.
Now, a group of researchers led by Albuquerque-based Sandia National Laboratories have demonstrated a lithium-sulfur redox mediated flow battery that utilizes a high surface area lithium scaffold to enable even 10 times faster cycling.
In their previous research, the group had designed a redox mediated lithium-sulfur hybrid flow battery containing a lithium metal anode and sulfur in the catholyte reservoir. However, they had observed that the charge rate was limited by dendrite growth on the lithium anode.
This issue, which is common to many lithium-metal-based redox flow batteries, imposes considerable design constraints. Namely, the limited charge rate increases the minimum required electrochemical cell size for a given power output and drives system costs upwards.
To address these limitations, the researchers have replaced the planar lithium anode in redox mediated lithium sulfur redox flow batteries with a high surface area scaffold, which enabled 10 times faster cycling, up to 10 mA cm−2, compared to the same systems with planar anodes, without short circuit or voltage instability.
In their latest study, the researchers first tested the high surface area nickel foam in lithium/lithium symmetric cells and then in a full prelithiated redox flow battery.
They have further improved the cell performance with the addition of zinc oxide to the nickel foam, which promotes better lithium wetting, improving the Coulombic efficiency of the cells.
Finally, they demonstrated that the use of the zinc oxide-nickel foam scaffold also allows the redox flow batteries to be built in an “anode-less” configuration, improving the safety and decreasing the cost to assemble and ship a battery.
Importantly, these improved cells have also shown scalability. Namely, when the sulfur loading is increased from 2.4 to 5 mg cm−2 the capacity is also increased. In fact, with loadings at 5 mgS cm−2 the power density of their redox flow battery was over 20 Wh L−1, making it comparable to vanadium redox flow batteries.
“Having addressed the limitations of the Li anode, there is now further room for improvement of the system by investigating kinetic limitations of the Li-S reaction and capacity fade caused by polysulfide shuttling,” the researchers write. “The fast cycle rate and scalability of the system shows that it is viable for grid scale energy storage in the future.”
Their findings are discussed in “Fast cycling of ‘anode-less' redox-mediated Li-S flow batteries,” published in the Journal of Energy Storage.

Colorado-based Ascent Solar, a supplier of thin-film solar panels, has achieved a significant increase in power conversion efficiency for its CIGS solar cells. 
Ascent Solar achieved a 15.2% efficiency, bounding past the 10.8% standard efficiency measured for production material in 2012. The US Department of Energy said that although laboratory-scale cell efficiencies have exceeded 20%, commercially viable CIGS modules typically have efficiencies between 12% and 14%. 
CIGS technology is a versatile material that can be fabricated by multiple processes and implemented in different form factors. It can be deposited on substrates like glass, metal foils, and polymers, allowing for lightweight or flexible modules. 
Starting with an ultra-thin, 25 micron (µ), polyimide base film, the final thickness of Ascent Solar’s thin film is 52 µ. For reference, a human hair is on average 72µ thick. This enables lightweight power production at 68.4 grams per square meter. 
The company’s breakthrough in efficiency for commercial cells is attributed to replacing cadmium sulfide, a harsh and hazardous material, with zinc oxysulfide. Preliminary measurements have shown the replacement material to offer 5% to 8% higher efficiency, offering a theoretical limit of about 16%. 
“We’re thrilled with the recent achievements in process optimization for our CIGS technology, an innovation in thin film PV that we believe positions us for increased commercial adoption,” said Paul Warley, chief executive officer of Ascent Solar. “With continued increases in efficiency, we anticipate expanding sales into both new and existing markets and meeting the ever-increasing demand for solar power in targeted specialty applications.” 
Ascent Solar said its technology is suitable for flexible applications like agrivoltaic installations, building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), drones and autonomous aircraft, and space and defense applications.  
Ascent Solar’s research and development center and 5 MW production facility is in Thornton, Colorado. The company’s technology is backed by 40 years of research and development and 15 years of manufacturing experience.
In April Ascent Solar announced the closing of its acquisition of Flisom AG, a Swiss manufacturer of thin-film solar modules with 15 MW of production capacity.
In December 2022, the company secured a $50 million equity financing from two institutional investors.  It said it intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes including financing its continued growth, strategic investments in partnerships and capital expenditures.

Inverted perovskite cells have a device structure known as “p-i-n”, in which hole-selective contact p is at the bottom of intrinsic perovskite layer i with electron transport layer n at the top. Conventional halide perovskite cells have the same structure but reversed – a “n-i-p” layout.
In n-i-p architecture, the solar cell is illuminated through the electron-transport layer (ETL) side; in the p-i-n structure, it is illuminated through the hole‐transport layer (HTL) surface.
“Our provides an excellent approach to ensure that electronic Fermi-level can be tuned according to absorber layer bandgap and hence will be highly useful for tandem solar cells application,” the research's lead author, Dinesh Kabra, told pv magazine. ” Furthermore, it provides an added advantage of wettability of halide perovskite solution to provide a compact, reproducible and scalable layer. Which is known to be a major challenge for this technology along with stability.”
The scientists explained that the Me‑4PACz HTL is a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) that is able to suppress nonradiative recombination at the interface between the perovskite absorber and the Me‑4PACz layer.
The solar cell has an active area of 0.175 cm2. It is based on a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), an interfacial layer made of the PFN polymer, the Me‑4PACz HTL, the perovskite absorber, an electron transport layer (ETL) made of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) layer, and an indium zinc oxide (IZO) transparent conductive oxide film.
Tested under standard conditions, the cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 20.7%. “To the best of our knowledge, the obtained device efficiency is one of the highest values reported for Me‑4PACz with a triple-cation perovskite composition having a bandgap of 1.6 eV,” the scientists said, noting that the device was able to retain the initial efficiency for 3,000 h.

“We believe that the mixing engineering of the Me‑4PACz SAM with the electrolyte polymer PFN‑Br will not only open new doors to tackle hydrophobic SAMs in solution-processable efficient photovoltaic devices but also allow designing new electrolyte-based polymers and/or small molecules that can be combined with SAMs, thereby quilting a better interface,” the scientists said.
The solar cell was presented in the study “Resolving the Hydrophobicity of the Me-4PACz Hole Transport Layer for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency >20%,” published in ACS Publications.

REC Silicon ASA is entering into a supply agreement between its subsidiary, REC Solar Grade Silicon LLC, and Hanwha Q Cells Georgia, Inc., a wholly owned unit of Hanwha Solutions. The American-made, low-carbon polysilicon produced at REC Silicon’s Moses Lake facility in Washington will be used for ingot/wafer manufacturing at the new Qcells manufacturing facility in Georgia, which will begin operation late next year. The 10-year take-or-pay supply agreement is for high purity fluidized bed reactor (FBR) granular polysilicon.
FBR technology has been hailed as a means to produce polysilicon for solar at lower costs and with a small fraction of the electricity used by the dominant Siemens process.
In March 2022, Hanwha Solutions announced stepped up efforts to supply customers with U.S.-made products. Hanwha launched this effort by becoming the largest shareholder of REC Silicon, a major US manufacturer of polysilicon. Now, to secure the supply agreement obligations and to help restart of the Moses Lake facility, Hanwha will make sizable prepayments at the time of the signing of the supply agreement and at first delivery.
In January of this year, Qcells announced what is considered the largest investment in US solar history, with plans to invest more than $2.5  billion to build a complete solar supply chain in the United States. This makes Qcells the first company to establish a fully-integrated silicon-based solar supply chain in the United States.
The estimated total value of the supply agreement for the duration of the REC Silicon arrangement will fluctuate depending on market prices, which are currently estimated to be approximately $3 billion. REC Silicon reports that the restart of the plant is expected by Nov. 1, and it has a goal of reaching full capacity by the end of 2024.
The base price for the polysilicon will be determined by market indices, including markets both inside and outside of China, adjusted for a premium for U.S.-sourced low-carbon material. The polysilicon will also benefit from the $3 per kilogram tax credit from the US Inflation Reduction Act.
The re-opening of the Moses Lake operations will enable REC Silicon to provide high-purity polysilicon to the emerging US solar supply chain. In addition, REC Silicon manufactures silane gas (SiH4)  at its plant in Butte, Montana, which serves the fast growing battery industry.

French renewables developer Akuo has won a tender tio build a large-scale battery storage system in New Caledonia, a French overseas territory in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The giant battery is expected to be the largest storage facility in the region and also in France, with a planned storage capacity of 200 MWh.
The plant will be based on lithium-ion batteries and will be commissioned at the end of 2024. It will be able to deliver 50 MW of electricity to the network every day for three hours.
New Caledonian energy supplier Enercal will directly manage the facility.
“It’s a fairly common contract for storage,” Corentin Baschet, head of market research for Clean Horizon, told pv magazine. “This is very common in the United States, a bit like a rental contract, which is usually called a tolling agreement.”
In such contracts, a guaranteed power premium, paid annually, determines the price. Additionally, a variable cost premium is added to cover maintenance and operation, with the latter expected to be very low, according to Baschet, due to the minimal costs associated with storage infrastructure.
“Whether the battery is used little or a lot, that does not change the price,” Baschet said.
However,  he added that the use of batteries is governed by the provisions of the contract – for example, with regard to the state of charge or the number of cycles.
The installation, located in the town of Boulouparis on the west coast of Grande Terre, will store electrical energy generated by PV plants during the day and release it at night.
In line with its recently adopted New Caledonia Energy Transition Plan in August 2023, New Caledonia aims to further promote the development of renewable energy and storage devices for integration into the network.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/07/new-bio-inspired-based-algorithm-to-improve-pv-output-under-partial-shading/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,EGYPT,SAUDI ARABIA",LIOR KAHANA,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2023",New bio-inspired based algorithm to improve PV output under partial shading,"An international research team has proposed use of a modified version of the tunicate swarm algorithm (TSA) to help PV arrays achieve an improved yield under partial shading conditions. The TSA is an algorithm inspired by marine animal tunicates' method for food hunting. It tries to reproduce the way swarms of it avoid conflict between search areas, find candidate solutions, and finally converge at the most prosperous place.
“The TSA provides two behaviors for finding food sources which are jet propulsion and swarm intelligence. The jet propulsion behavior occurs through satisfying three conditions, avoiding conflict between search agents, moving to the location of the best position (candidate solutions), and converging the location of the best-obtained solution,” the scientists explained. “However, the swarm's behavior updates the positions of other tunicates based on the best existing solution.”
The modified TSA (MTSA) works by controlling the DC-DC boost converter at the PV array terminals, as it configures the suitable duty cycle – that is the switching on and off of the different parts in the electric circuit, in accordance with the shade patterns. It aims to achieve the lowest possible difference between the global peak, which is the output that is achieved in standard testing, and the multi-local peak, which is the maximum output that can be reached under certain shading conditions.
The researchers used the algorithm in four PV system configurations with five different shade patterns. They found the MTSA obtained power errors of 0.0652 W, 0.00026 W, 0.00022 W, and 0.000067 W, respectively under different shading conditions. Under uniform irradiance, it achieved an error of 0.000047 W.
“It is clear that the proposed MTSA is the best one in all studied shade patterns,” the researchers said, noting that they compared its performance with that of a pure TSA algorithm, as well as with that of the teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), Coot, CapSA, and P&O algorithms, which are all commonly utilized in PV applications.
“The proposed MTSA updates the tunicates’ positions in the current population based on randomly determined positions in the exploration phase,” they explained. “As a result, in the swarm behavior phase two different random numbers are incorporated in the tunicate’s updating equation to provide solutions in different positions in the search area.”
The algorithm is presented in the paper “Modified tunicate swarm algorithm-based methodology for enhancing the operation of partially shaded photovoltaic system,” published in the Alexandria Engineering Journal. “The proposed tracker will be applied on large-scale PV system in the next works to validate its robustness,” the academics said, referring to the future directions of their work.
The research group includes scientists from the Jouf University and the King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals in Saudi Arabia, as well as from the Higher Technological Institute in Egypt.
