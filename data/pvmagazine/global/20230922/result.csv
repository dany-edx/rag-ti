Principal Analyst Holly Hu, speaking at a conference this week in Chuzhou, Anhui province, attributed the forecast to the convergence of three factors in 2023: the recovery of the ground-mounted PV market due to lower module prices, robust growth in the EU, US, and Chinese distributed solar markets, and rising demand for PV installations driven by green hydrogen production.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) says that it has approved Xinte’s initial public offering application. The company plans to issue a maximum of 30,000,000 shares to raise up to CNY 8.8 billion ($1.2 billion), which will be directed to an electronic-grade polysilicon production base with an annual capacity of 200,000 metric tons. According to the prospectus, Xinte's total polysilicon capacity reached 200,000 metric tons by the end of 2022.
GCL Technology has confirmed the start of production for its 100,000 metric ton (MT) granular silicon project dedicated to n-type products. Construction started in November 2022. It marks the fourth granular silicon production site, following those in Leshan, Baotou, and Hohhot. At full capacity, the facility is expected to reach 120,000 tons. GCL Technology has expressed plans to further augment the maximum effective production capacity across all its plants.

H2EX will deploy Space Technologies' passive seismic sensors, with a survey scheduled for the fourth quarter.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that low-emission hydrogen represents less than 1% of global production and use, with ongoing low capacity and volumes due to developers awaiting government support amid rising costs. The IEA's latest report warns of rising expenses threatening project profitability, due to global energy crises, high inflation, and supply chain disruptions. “This confluence of factors is particularly detrimental for an industry that faces high upfront costs related to equipment manufacturing, construction, and installation,” it said. China leads in hydrogen investments, with electrolyzer capacity set to triple to 2GW by the end of 2023, with China contributing half.
Verdagy, an electrolyzer company, has announced the opening of a new factory in Newark, California. It is set to manufacture advanced water electrolyzers at scale in the United States starting in the first quarter of 2024. The company aims to achieve the US Department of Energy’s goal of $2/kg of levelized cost of hydrogen by 2026.
Luxcara is joining the Hamburg Green Hydrogen Hub (HGHH) project in partnership with Hamburger Energiewerke. The project, located at the former Moorburg coal power plant site in Hamburg, Germany, includes plans for a 100 MW electrolyzer powered by renewable energy sources, targeting production commencement in 2026. The consortium has submitted a national Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) funding application to the German government for review.

Dutch grid operators and power generation asset owners are now taking a range of actions to reduce grid load and prevent PV curtailment.
With this in mind, researchers from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) have looked at the impact of different penetration rates of electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps, and PV generation on the Dutch grid. They analyzed the effects of these technologies on over-loading and nodal voltage deviations in different distribution grids and seasons.
“The authors acknowledge that grid impact assessment studies are highly dependent on the investigated grid specifications and case study characteristics,” the research group said. “Therefore, the results should not be straightforwardly generalized for all case studies, that investigate different distribution grids. Nevertheless, this work can provide valuable insights, especially in the case of the Netherlands.”
The academics used real data from Dutch distribution grid operators and categorized the country's different distribution networks as light-loaded rural grids, heavy-loaded rural grids, light-loaded suburban grids, heavy-loaded suburban grids, light-loaded urban grids and heavy-loaded urban grids. Using computer software, they simulated grid conditions with only PV and EV penetration, or only PV and heat pumps. They also took into account the combined penetration of PV, heat pumps, and EVs.
They set the penetration rates for the simulation at 50%, 80%, and 100%.
According to their findings, Dutch suburban areas are the most vulnerable to increased penetration of all technologies. In summer and winter, the suburban grids showed an overloading of up to 800%. As for line overloading, both suburban grids are overloaded from 50% total penetration, with heavy suburban grids having lines exceeding 700% overloading.
“The light suburban grid sees a voltage drop under 0.9 per-unit (pu) even from 50% penetration (once), while also once voltage drops under 0.85 pu at 100% penetration,” the academic said. “Multiple undervoltage incidents are observed in the heavy suburban grid at all three penetrations. Reaching up to 0.65 pu. and 0.42 pu at 80% and 100% penetrations, respectively.”
In the rural grid results, the light configuration exhibited no transformer violations under any circumstance, while the heavy rural grid experienced transformer overload at a 50% penetration of combined PVs, heat pumps, and EVs. Line overloading was absent in the light rural grid but occurred in the heavy rural grid at an 80% penetration rate. Neither under nor overvoltage was observed in both rural grids.
Similarly, in the urban grids, there were no instances of under or over-voltage. During winter, the urban grids demonstrated a maximum transformer overload of 331% and line overload of 164% under full penetration. In the summer, also under 100% penetration, these figures were 258% and 125%, respectively.
“The more frequent use of heat pumps for heating/cooling provokes a higher grid impact overall, but the longer EV charging periods provoke more long-lasting violations,” the researchers said. “The results have also been compared with results by aggregated data from databases, showing that bottom-up approaches present more pessimistic results than top-down approaches. However, the main insights remain similar.”
The researchers presented their findings in “Assessing the grid impact of Electric Vehicles, Heat Pumps & PV generation in Dutch LV distribution grids,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.
“The higher insulation and the improvement of the energy label of the future buildings are highly recommended for the minimization of the grid impact by the future electric heating,” they said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/22/uk-may-rejoin-gw-club-this-year/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED KINGDOM",ANGELA SKUJINS,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2023",UK may rejoin GW club this year,"At the end of August, the UK’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) published the solar PV cumulative capacity data for July 2023, revealing it was 15,292.8 MW.
From January to July, the country added 634.8 MW of new PV systems, compared to 315.5 MW in the same period the previous year.
In July alone, around 71.3 MW of new additions were recorded, though the figures are considered provisional and expected to be revised upward as more data on newly operational sites is received. Newly installed PV capacity in July 2022 was 46.4 MW, and in June of this year, new additions totaled 84 MW.
Gareth Simkins, a spokesperson for PV association Solar Energy UK headquartered in London, told pv magazine these figures were “relatively low.”
“But I rather suspect it's a blip,” he said. “Secondly, one thing that I would stress is that the stats aren't considered enormously reliable.”
Chris Hewett, CE of Solar Energy UK, explained the government figures tended to “lag” on utility-scale PV operations, and there was no “reliable data” to quantify commercial industry rooftop output. “That has been flatlining with the government stats over the last couple of years,” he said. “We know for a fact that there's a lot more going on with the commercial rooftop compared to the government numbers.”
Hewett said that according to anecdotal feedback he was getting from association members, commercial rooftop solar and residential small-scale systems were experiencing market growth. Simkins estimated the July figure should be 16 GW. He predicted figures for 2023, 2024 and 2025 should reflect “strong growth” in the sector.
“To reach the government's 70 GW target by 2035 implies installing 4.5 GW of capacity each year from now until then, though that is within the realms of capability for the industry as it continues to ramp up,” he said. “Obviously, we're not going to go to that immediately, it's going to increase in terms of the pace but we will get there and quite possibly exceed it.”
In March 2023, the UK government set up the Solar Taskforce – a consortium of solar industry stakeholders, jointly chaired by Hewett, assigned with expediting actions to achieve 70 GW solar deployment by 2035. Initiatives focus on increasing rooftop and ground-mount solar but also span securing investment and boosting the sector’s skilled workforce. The Solar Taskforce aims to publish a roadmap next year to deliver the 70 GW by 2035 target.
Hewett said the biggest challenge facing the UK’s solar PV sector was grid connection and investment, which was historically impacted by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem). Ofgem is the government regulator for the electricity and downstream natural gas markets.
“Some of Ofgem's rules was depressing the amount of investment, which the networks were allowed to do because it was deemed to be increasingly the consumer bill,” he said. “Obviously now since solar and wind are the cheaper technologies on the market, the quicker you can get solar and wind onto the market the quicker you can drive down the prices.”
The second largest issue facing the sector was developing a skilled labor force. Hewett said this meant ensuring installers and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) companies could adequately recruit accredited workers to match demand. “We're starting to run events on recruitment and run more things on training so that's a challenge, but it's one which the industry is starting to face,” he said.
Hewett added other issues spanned increasing the reliability of the supply chain and building up internal capabilities, such as the manufacture and sale of kit batteries, and more broadly eliminating “nitty gritty” issues surrounding rooftop-solar. This would include niche challenges, such as renters negotiating with landlords about the possibility of implementing rooftop solar on leased properties.
Anecdotally, Hewett said Solar Energy UK was seeing “a lot” of battery installations with home solar sales, “so at least 50% of all solar installations will have a battery with them now. That's something which is a big feature of the UK market.” Over a million UK homes have their roofs fitted with solar panels, according to the UK government's website, but there is still “untapped potential” as commercial buildings, schools, warehouses, car parks and water bodies could accommodate rooftop solar.
Noteworthy utility-scale solar PV projects in the country include the 350 MW Cleve Hill Solar Park on the north Kent coast slated for a 2024 completion, and the 840 MW Botley West Solar Farm in Oxfordshire, which has not had its planning permission submitted yet.

However, despite the proximity to Europe across the Mediterranean, the climatology of Africa leads to very different seasonal generation patterns from what European solar producers experience. Data analysed by Solcast, via the Solcast API, shows this seasonal variance from summer to winter in 2023.
Egypt leads North African nations in solar capacity, with 2 GW installed, and 17 GW announced or in development. Following closely are Morocco with 700 MW installed, 12.5 GW prospective capacity and Algeria with 454 MW operational and 5 GW prospective.
The high solar generation potential in North Africa is already delivering power through two links from Morocco to Spain, and discussions are in progress for a link to South-West England. Understanding the seasonal patterns of generation in Africa is essential in consideration of power needs for local grids, as well as decisions to invest and build additional capacity for dispatch to Europe.

Unsurprisingly for a desert region, summers are hot in Northern Africa, mainly because the sub-tropical ridge of high pressure suppresses rain and clouds across the region. This leads to strong irradiance through most of the summer, with only rare summer storms impacting generation. This is seen in the above image from August 2023, where Northern Africa saw consistently high irradiance across the board.
Further south, summers see seasonal rains, bringing frequent large cloud events and significantly reducing typical irradiance. These large cloud covers are associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and also see high rainfall at this time of year.
In contrast, winters see the solar potential reach further south, as shorter days in the north decrease irradiance and the intertropical convergence-related cloud moves south of the equator, leaving western Africa from Senegal to Nigeria with clearer days where they benefit from higher irradiance. This seasonal pattern can be seen in the below January 2023 average for the region.

Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150GW of solar assets globally.

Solar energy plants typically underperform due to a range of factors, such as the selection of the wrong location or wrong technology, the environment, pollution, extreme weather, and dirt.
Researchers at IIT Mandi evaluated seven NTPC solar PV plants in India with the goal of determining the best-performing solar PV plant in terms of cost, environment, technicality, and location. The researchers said the methodology used in their study will help decision makers to find suitable sites for solar power plants. 
The researchers chose the following criteria in decreasing order of importance: economic, technical, environmental, and connectivity. They gave the most significance to economic criteria because of the large initial investment cost associated with the PV plants and the high operation and maintenance costs. 
The selection of Dadri, Port Blair, Ramagundam, Talcher Kaniha, Faridabad, Unchahar, and Singrauli solar PV plants was based on two key factors. First, all of these plants are constructed by the same company, NTPC. Second, they collectively represent a broad spectrum of India's climatic conditions, including composite, tropical, hot and dry, and warm and humid zones.
The researchers, Shweta Singh and Satvasheel Pawar, used hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods such as F-SWARA, F-COPRAS, and F-ELECTRE to compare these solar PV plants based on four main criteria and twelve sub-criteria. They referred to the data available from the existing literature, the NTPC website, other internet resources, and through NTPC field visits for the evaluation.
The study concluded that Unchahar solar PV power plant is the best alternative in terms of performance, location, development, and management, while Faridabad solar PV and Port Blair solar PV plants are the least preferred on these parameters. 
The results indicate that Unchahar solar PV plant stands out due to its exceptional performance. It boasts the lowest levelized cost of energy at $0.00011/kWh and the lowest total cost at $579,263/MW, surpassing the other six plants. It also demonstrates the second-highest overall efficiency at 14.15%, which was a significant factor in the evaluation, as technical criteria are the second most crucial consideration.
In comparison to other solar plants, the amount of CO2 reduction (environmental criteria) in the case of the Unchahar solar PV plant (1,389.5 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent per annum per MW) is the third best. Regarding location, Unchahar solar PV also has very good connectivity values, with the nearest railhead connectivity (5 km) and nearest city/town connectivity (3.8 km).
The operation and maintenance cost for Dadri solar ($4,092.57/MW per year) is less in comparison with Unchahar ($5,600.35/MW per year) and Faridabad solar PV ($7,215.84/MW per year) due to installation of 64 robots for dry cleaning on daily basis.

Warren Campbell, the COO of the Stockholm-based independent power producer (IPP), told pv magazine that the 100 MW solar park in Eurajoki, western Finland, is one of the country’s largest solar parks in development.
“The first thing is it's a big project by Finnish standards,” he said. “It's certainly bigger than anything that's been built up until now.”
Construction is set to begin on the ground-mounted solar park in the second half of 2024, with commissioning scheduled for early 2026. Campbell said the project will cost €50 million ($53.1 million) to build. He said the company has equity financing “available” and ready, and it secured €150 million last year when European infrastructure fund DIF acquired a majority stake in it.
The solar project is expected to generate 107 GWh/year. It will be built in the Satakunta region, which records some of the highest radiation levels in Finland.
“It's a natural area to look at for solar,” Campbell said. “This municipality, the Eurajurki municipality, is where Finland's nuclear power is; they are the energy heartland of Finland. So we feel like it's a municipality that knows and understands energy and is particularly keen to continue to be a leader. They're very keen to take an early position in solar as well and support the environment.”
Finland’s zero-carbon energy sources represented roughly 40% of the country’s total energy end-consumption in 2021, with nuclear comprising 33%. Last year, it enacted the Carbon neutral Finland 2035 – national climate and energy strategy, with one of the policy aims including the “phasing out” of Russian fossil fuels and the shoring up of renewable energy sources.
Although Campbell could not say what kind of technology would be used for the installation other than it being ground-mounted, as it was early days, he didn’t rule out the possibility of bifacial panels, as they have been used in previous projects.
Alight does not have any power purchase agreements (PPAs) locked in for the new solar park, but Campbell said he is confident the company will secure 10- to 15-year contracts with large corporate and industrial customers. “We will be looking to sell with PPAs the production from this site before we make an investment decision,” he said.
Campbell added the news signaled the company’s long-held appetite to expand into Finland. “This is 100 MW. I'd say our ambition is to have 500 MW to a GW within the next 12 months, so we're actively looking for new projects and new partners in Finland,” he said.
Other solar parks under development in the country include a 216 MW renewable energy hybrid park in Alajärvi and Kyyjärvi overseen by Ilmatar Energy Oy, and a 500 MW solar power plant in Palloneva managed by ATP Palloneva Oy.
According to recent statistics collected by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Finland had 591 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2022.

GoodWe has started offering its Polaris Series solar carport panels in Australia as part of a broader push into the nation's building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) market.
The Polaris panels are tailored for carports and shade rooftops, said the company.
“The products effectively overcome significant limitations found in conventional panels for similar applications,” said Apollo Chai, head of BIPV marketing for GoodWe Australia. “It adapts to diverse application scenarios, including carports, flat-to-pitched roof conversions, and sun sheds.”
Traditional panels face barriers in carports and solar shading applications due to issues related to water drainage and wiring, including safety hazards caused by exposed wiring in traditional modules, according to GoodWe.
It noted that the Polaris Series addresses these issues in its design, which includes water-protective grooves to contain wiring. GoodWe said the Polaris panels are capable of withstanding static loads of up to 5400 Pa on the front side and 2400 Pa on the back, making them equipped for extreme weather conditions, including hurricanes.
The Polaris panels have a power output of 550 W and an efficiency of 20.4%. They are certified by Germany’s TÜV and have been included in the Clean Energy Council’s approved product list.
GoodWe introduced two other BIPV products to the Australian market in the last year, including the ultra lightweight Galaxy panel, designed for low load-bearing rooftops, and a solar tile known as Sunshine Tiles.

Maxeon Solar Technologies says that it is acquiring Complete Solaria’s dealer channel operations, as well as its solar panel patent portfolio relating to shingled cell solar panel technology.
The shingled cell technology, originally developed by SunPower, is incorporated into Maxeon’s Performance line of solar modules. The 425 W modules use bifacial mono-PERC solar cells made on large-format eight-inch G12 wafers, and have an efficiency of 20.6%, according to Maxeon. Maxeon was spun off from SunPower in 2020, when both became separate entities.
Maxeon’s CEO Bill Mulligan said that the transaction with Complete Solaria will expand the company’s distributed generation footprint incorporating Solaria’s dealer chanel, which will accelerate Maxeon’s direct sales efforts. Plus, he said, it will give Maxeon “immediate access to a qualified source of tariff-free solar panels that we plan to market adjacent to our flagship IBC solar panels, allowing us to replicate in the US market the “better-best” product strategy we have successfully employed in our international markets for years.”
California-based Complete Solaria is an integrated provider of solar installation solutions using its own 360 W to 400 W solar modules. The company was formed in November 2022, when Solaria merged with installer Complete Solar, and operated the resulting Complete Solaria business as a vertically integrated company. In July of this year the company announced its intention to go public upon completion of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger with Freedom Acquisition I Corporation
The acquisition of Complete Solaria’s solar panel patent portfolio adds to the over 130 granted patents and over 80 pending patent applications for fundamental shingled solar cell panel technology. Mulligan noted that Maxeon designs and manufactures globally, and plans to use the shingled solar cell technology in its the cell and module manufacturing facility the company plans to build in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Maxeon announced in August that it had chosen Albuquerque for its new 3 GW facility, which will produce TOPCon PV-silicon cell technology and the Maxeon’s proprietary shingled-cell Performance Line solar modules. The company said the facility will produce millions of solar modules each year for the growing utility-scale and distributed-generation markets in the U.S. Maxeon reports that its new plant is expected to be the first large-scale cell and module manufacturing in New Mexico. While 3 GW is the planned capacity, the company said there’s a chance it will increase it to 4.5 GW in the future.
According to Will Anderson, CEO of Complete Solaria, after the transaction is complete, the company plans to concentrate on it core systems segment.
“This transaction will provide Complete Solaria with capital to optimize our end-to-end customer offering, including beautiful, high-quality solar energy systems with Maxeon premium, high performance solar panels,” said Anderson.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/22/how-solar-tariffs-destroyed-tens-of-thousands-of-jobs-in-germany/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,GERMANY",,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2023",How solar tariffs destroyed tens of thousands of jobs in Germany,"From pv magazine Germany
On Sept. 3, 2018, the European Union's anti-subsidy, anti-dumping tariffs, and minimum price regulations on solar products from China came to an end. Despite the disastrous experience, it appears that parts of the solar industry and politicians are once again advocating for protective measures, five years later. It's crucial to reflect on the past.
In late 2012, discussions began about the measures introduced in 2013. Many companies that supported the tariffs went bankrupt while the measures were in effect. A prominent advocate, German module manufacturer Solarworld, even faced insolvency twice and has since exited the market. Concurrently, these tariffs eliminated tens of thousands of jobs in trade, planning, project management, and other sectors during their implementation. How did this catastrophic situation occur, and why was there no public outcry over such extensive livelihood destruction?
Industrial success
The disaster was preceded by an unprecedented and world-first build-up of production for solar products in Germany, which began in the mid-1990s and then progressed rapidly with the German renewable energy law, the so-called EEG issued in 2000. In Germany and Europe, factories were built along the entire value chain for crystalline silicon photovoltaics, from ingots, wafers, and cells to module production, including factories for various thin-film technologies.
The cost of the products fell rapidly. In China, too, solar pioneers were able to build factories and grow quickly. Thanks to the EEG and similar subsidies in Spain, the Czech Republic and Italy, the markets and production figures grew quickly. For a long time, Germany was responsible for more than 50% of the global installation market.
With the end of the Spanish boom at the end of 2008, the first major sales crisis began. The massive problems in the young PV industry began in 2009. At that time, statistics from German PV association BSW revealed that there were around 32,000 industrial jobs in the German solar industry out of 61,000 jobs in the German solar industry overall.
The year 2009 initially got off to a weak start, with many companies going into crisis mode. Then the second half of the year was very strong in terms of installation numbers. This was due to massive price cuts. Therefore, the thunderclap on the eve of the major EU PVSEC conference in Hamburg in September 2009 came as a surprise to many: Qcells, the model company at the time, announced the layoff of 500 employees. Due to the crisis, co-founder and board member Anton Milner also had to vacate his seat in March 2010. It should not be forgotten that Anton Milner has twice built a company valued at billions of Euros in a short period of time. In addition to Qcells, he achieved this together with his wife Dagmar Vogt at Ib Vogt, which quickly became one of the largest global EPC/IPP companies with 1,000 employees.
Qcells was restructured, but the company's insolvency was unavoidable during the crisis in 2012. Bitter, but from today's perspective the story ended relatively well. With South Korean group Hanwha, an investor was found who expanded the brand globally and still maintains a large global development site in Thalheim.
Installation numbers in the European Union grew rapidly after 2009. However, it became apparent that competition from China grew quickly in production capacities and learned even faster to deliver good quality products. It also became clear that the Chinese government “believed in solar.” A brutal contrast to the black-yellow government that ruled Germany from the autumn 2009, which had very little knowledge of photovoltaics and had no kind of strategic industrial policy.
This was followed by the notorious EEG guillotine amendment in February 2012, which broke the German solar industry's neck.
The center-right winged government immediately went to work to “severely slow down the photovoltaics market” with several amendments to the EEG. That had an effect. Solon, a large module manufacturer, went bankrupt in 2011. Although prices fell, the installation market remained stable despite this braking policy. In 2010 and 2011, installations grew by around 7 GW. This was followed by the notorious EEG guillotine amendment in February 2012, which broke the German solar industry's neck. With the announcement that they wanted to implement an extremely large reduction in the subsidy tariffs within a week.
With the announcement that they wanted to implement an extremely large reduction in subsidy tariffs within a week, the government determined a total loss of confidence on the part of the capital markets in the further development of the German solar industry. Euler Hermes even terminated their credit lines and the retail trade on a massive scale.
We were all shocked by this absurd form of politics of destruction. Nevertheless, thanks to further price reductions, the installation part of the industry was able to hold on and in 2012 even achieved over 8 GW of new installations. It seemed as if the system integration, installation and project market had done its homework despite the massive incentive cuts and could now still operate at the lower funding level.
The German government made it clear it was not ready to pay more than this small amount of funding – if at all. In Spain, there were retroactive funding cuts. The markets also collapsed completely in the Czech Republic and Italy.
Solar jobs
Despite the crisis in the German photovoltaic industry that has been ongoing since 2009, the rapid growth created many new jobs in system integration, assembly system production, power electronics, trade, planning, operation and maintenance and other areas. According to Statista, there were over 150,000 jobs in the industry in 2011 – despite the layoffs and the first bankruptcies among manufacturers. For 2012, the statistics registered 126,300 solar jobs.
Solarworld was able to benefit massively in the years up to 2010 and 2011, in addition to growing competition, from its wafer exports to China and the import of OEM-manufactured solar modules from China, which came mainly from Suntech. When this fruitful relationship with China ended, Solarworld was forced not only to complain massively about China, but also to ask for the introduction of tariffs on China. Solarworld, however, had previously repeatedly rejected the request for such tariffs from other German manufacturers, which had been made since 2008 – for understandable selfish reasons.
In late 2012, as Solarworld's fight for import tariffs on all competitive solar products from China intensified, many in the non-industrial part of the solar industry could not imagine the disaster these tariffs would unleash.
In 2013, the non-industrial part of the industry was shut down – but not through further cuts in the EEG. The support provided by the EEG was no longer changed abruptly, but instead decreased again in a predictable manner. Meanwhile, the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy came as a second “guillotine”. The introduction of import tariffs on wafers, cells and solar modules first created brutal uncertainty and then the sheer impracticality of projects or installations.
Unfortunately, no one wanted to pay for solar power anymore. And certainly not for the modules that generate this solar power. A bitter experience – one that the EU manufacturers of solar modules, which are tiny and bring expensive products to the global market, are having to go through again.
The EU had started registering imports of solar products as part of its customs procedure. Orders were no longer possible without registration, and some shipping companies stopped transporting solar products due to the uncertainty. A brutal phase of uncertainty and wait-and-see strategies began. When it became increasingly clear that duties were coming, the German federal government, which otherwise had little to say about it, suddenly became concerned about the important economic relationship with China and took action in Brussels. The tariffs then became minimum prices with effect from August 2013. These had an equally devastating effect on the installation market in Germany and the EU – but without any advantage for the European Union.
The German solar market fell from over 8 GW in 2012 to 2.6 GW in 2013 and 1.19 GW in 2014. Without any abrupt cuts in subsidies in the EEG. A “sales blackout” took hold and companies started dying like flies. German high-tech manufacturing companies such as SMA Solar were also hit hard by the loss of almost their entire domestic market and, as a result, had to cut many of their industrial jobs in Germany. SMA Solar has now recovered and is currently doubling its production in Germany (without any extra subsidies) and today offers world-leading solutions in the large inverter segment. And this occurred through brutally tough competition with direct competitors from China. The fact that companies like SMA Solar were drawn into the vortex of Solarworld, which in my opinion was mismanaged, was a bizarre but direct consequence of the import tariffs on modules and raw materials.
Five bitter years followed. In terms of technology, too, the German installations were ultimately left behind by the design of the minimum prices. While the more efficient Mono-PERC technology became established globally in 2016, it was only possible to use it in Germany at reasonable prices and, above all, in relevant quantities from the end of 2018. Solarworld had not managed to scale and develop this technology, which was protected by particularly high tariffs. SolarWorld, however, had been one of the first on the world market to use PERC technology. But this is precisely where the brutal failure of the tariff instrument becomes apparent. It does not provide strategic, stable political and financial support for the domestic industry.
Between 2013 and the lowest point of the crisis, which peaked around 2016, over 80,000 jobs and hundreds of companies were destroyed. Lives were destroyed and many colleagues were permanently traumatized.
At the same time, the duties had no added value for the industrial sector. On the contrary, Solarworld went bankrupt twice during that time, despite tariffs being in place in its main markets in the United States (since 2012) and the European Union (since 2013). The company has now completely disappeared and the board of directors around the once dazzling Maserati and Rolls Royce driver Frank Asbeck is now on trial in Bonn. The insolvency administrator wants to claim a proud €731 million ($778.7 million) in damages.
Politicians and employment
Currently, we still have duties on solar glass in place in Europe and this continues to drive up costs for EU manufacturers and is a disadvantage for local module manufacturers. Although there is now only one solar glass manufacturer in the European Union, the entire EU manufacturing scene has failed or not even tried to abolish this tariff.
Many colleagues ask themselves again and again why small and medium-sized businesses of all kinds, which are often described as the pillars of our society, receive so little attention. While “coal buddies” or other factory workers – no matter their background – receive massive media and political attention for their concerns. Why do you make politics for a few that massively harms many?
The answer, not only in the solar sector, is the disastrous misperception of the number of jobs in industrial companies. There are a lot of people in one place and they organize themselves well for their own interests. They appear correspondingly united.
The solar manufacturing industry has been a smaller part of the German solar sector since 2009. A maximum of 32,000 jobs (probably fewer at that point) out of over 150,000 jobs in the solar industry were industrial jobs. The policies of the CDU/CSU/FDP government, together with the EU tariffs, had destroyed large parts of the solar industry.
The very low number of installations between 2013 and 2021 slowed down the energy transition and unnecessarily delayed technical progress in the European Union, including towards higher efficiencies, and the fight against climate change.
On Sept. 3, 2018, the tariffs were history. For 2022, the BSW again reported over 65,000 jobs, although industry only plays a marginal role. Meyer Burger, for example, had around 1,000 jobs in Germany and Switzerland in 2022. These 65,000 installed over 7 GW of photovoltaic power in one year. In 2023, with further growth on the way, 12 GW can definitely be achieved. With probably over 95,000 jobs in the German solar industry in 2023, with still only a marginal share of the manufacturing industry. I hope that this time politicians understand the dominant importance that the non-industrial part of the solar industry had and continues to have.
Milton Friedman, a Nobel Prize-winning American economist, expressed these connections as early as 1978 around the discussion about the then “evil” Japanese steel and car imports to the United States.
There, in the context of subsidized steel that Japan exports to the United States, he asks a rhetorical question: “If Japan decides to subsidize clean air exports to the USA, why should we object?” He gives his answer as to why free trade is still preferable.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/09/22/china-solar-cell-prices-hit-record-lows/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2023",China solar cell prices hit record lows,"Solar cell prices in China fell to their lowest values ever according to OPIS data. Mono M10 and Mono G12 cells both dipped more than 3% to $0.0865/W and $0.0856/W respectively, while TOPCon M10 cells notched 0.41% downwards to $0.0965/W.
The weak module market is largely to blame for cell price decreases, according to one source. Module plants without their own cell capacity have applied “many strategies to reduce production,” the source said. Mono PERC and TOPCon module prices are also at record lows, according to OPIS data.

Given that cell prices have fallen significantly, discussions are raging about whether cell makers will cut production. Some small makers are planning to halt operations over China’s Golden Week holiday at the start of October, reflecting a dim outlook for the cell market and marking a decline in cell output, an insider explained.
Others disagreed. If cell production is to fall, there should only be a slight decrease, a different source argued. “The overproduction of cells is not as bad relative to the entire supply chain,” the source said, referring to overproduction in the polysilicon, wafer and module segments.
For another source, lowering prices is the strategy by which cell makers maintain 100% operating rates. Whether the cell segment will cut output is strongly influenced by the rate at which wafer supply is growing and the manufacturing strategy of module manufacturers, he said.
“The decrease in module production may unavoidably compel a decrease in cell production by the end of October and the beginning of November,” the source also said, adding that end-users will reduce module purchasing orders because they have already arranged enough supply to support year-end solar installations.

The company displayed both n-type and traditional PERC cell technology.
Among the new modules displayed was a 54 half-cell n-type module with a full black aesthetic designed for rooftop applications. The module is a small, lightweight format that carries 425 W of maximum output power.
The new module, HY-DH108N8B, sports a 22% efficiency rating. It measures 152 cm x 114 cm x 3 cm and weighs 24 kg. The module has an 80% bifaciality rating.
The company also introduced two N-type modules with 72 and 78 half cells, designed for ground mounted projects and tracker systems. These modules carry between 560 W to 625 W of maximum output power and carry a 22.6% efficiency rating. Full specifications can be found here.
The 72 cell modules received an “Overall Highest Achiever” designation from the Renewable Energy Test Center (RETC). Read more about module evaluation and testing from RETC’s PV Module Index.
All the new modules come with a 15-year product warranty, a 30-year linear power warranty, and have protection for 1% degradation in the first year, and 0.4% in subsequent years.
In addition to releasing a new series of modules, the company inked strategic partnerships at RE+. Hyperion, the high-end brand of Runergy, signed a strategic agreement with Nanosun to enter markets like Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. It also entered an agreement with Grape Solar, focusing on the U.S. market.
