EDF Renouvelables, the renewable energy unit of French energy giant EDF, has commissioned its first floating PV plant in France. The 20 MW facility is located on a water surface close to a hydropower dam operated by EDF near Lazer, in the southern region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur.
“EDF Renewables drew on the expertise it has developed at international level, with four floating solar power plants already constructed in Israel and the USA,” said Bruno Bensasson, EDF Group senior executive vice president, renewable energy.
CRE, the country's regulator, selected the project in a tender held in 2018.
The solar plant will provide additional power alongside the hydropower facility, particularly during summer when water from Lazer Lake is mainly used for irrigation. EDF stated that the anchoring and float system allows for adaptation to reservoir water level changes without affecting its operation.
This installation reinforces EDF Renewables' presence in the Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur region. In 2023, the company plans to commission five new solar power plants, adding to the existing five plants and increasing EDF Renewables' regional solar production capacity to 85 MW.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/21/portugals-january-april-pv-installations-hit-118-mw/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,PORTUGAL",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JUNE 21, 2023",Portugal’s January-April PV installations hit 118 MW,"The latest statistics from Portugal's Directorate General for Energy and Geology (DGEG) show that the country added just 118 MW of new solar capacity in the first four months of 2023.
Despite a sluggish start to the year, new solar installations in Portugal may have gained momentum in May and June, mirroring the trend from the previous year. From January to April 2022, Portugal added only 111 MW, but in May, it saw an increase of 262 MW, bringing the total to 373 MW. In June, an additional 173 MW was installed, reaching a cumulative total of 546 MW. However, the second half of the year experienced slower growth, with only 344 MW of new additions.
BloombergNEF predicts that Portugal's solar installations will reach 1,363 MW by the end of 2023, a substantial increase compared to last year's 890 MW and the current 118 MW of new capacity. The research provider estimates that Portugal will add 1,632 MW in 2024, 1,749 MW in 2025, and 1,741 MW in 2026. From 2030 onwards, BNEF projects relatively stable annual installations of around 1,745 MW.
The 2026 cut-off for increasing yearly installations is noteworthy: it is the commissioning deadline for the winners of the record-breaking Portuguese solar auctions from 2019 and 2020. That is if the deadline doesn’t get pushed back again. In February this year, Portugal introduced longer deadlines for several stages of these projects’ commissioning process. The country’s energy secretary Ana Fontoura Gouveia identified the global instability caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as the culprit and warned further extensions could not be ruled out if the war continues.  
The slow progress of the record-breaking solar auction projects, on the other hand, is likely a key culprit for Portugal’s lagging new capacity additions. From the 2019 auction, only seven out of 25 PV plants are in operation. No project from the 2020 auction has been commissioned so far. The 2019 auction allocated 1,150 MW of grid capacity, with the 2020 auction allocating 670 MW, totaling 1,820 MW across both auctions.  
The French developer Akuo won a project with a solar tariff of €0.0147 ($0.014)/kWh at the 2019 auction. This marked a new world record at the time. In 2020, the record was broken again, with a winning bid of $0.0132/kWh.  
In October 2022, the Portuguese government offered a remuneration boost to winners of these auctions, which had proved non-bankable amid rising inflation and equipment prices. The new law also introduced a 12-month extension of the period in which selected projects can sell electricity at spot market prices, instead of the awarded tariff. 
It seems that these measures weren’t sufficient to convince auction winners to bring their projects online. Only 5% of the nominal power awarded at the 2019 and 2020 auctions was online by mid-March, according to data from Portugal’s Ministry of Environmental and Climate Action analyzed the by financial newspaper O Jornal Económico. Of these 92 MW being injected into the grid, Prodigy Orbit, owned by the Spanish Solaria, developed four projects with 49 MW of capacity. Iberdrola has two PV plants in operation, with 20 MW and 10 MW of capacity. Finally, Made Better, a subsidiary of the Portuguese Grupo Lusiaves, has a 13 MW installation connected to the grid. 
The new deadlines for commissioning the projects from the 2019 auction are April 2024 and April 2025, depending on whether the projects require environmental approval. Solar projects that occupy surfaces of less than 100 hectares are exempt from environmental approval, excluding projects in protected areas. The deadlines for the 2020 auction projects are June 2025 and 2026.  
The largest solar plants in the 2019 auction belong to the French of Akuo, with lots of 150 MW, 120 MW, and 100 MW. There are another three projects over 100 MW in size. In the 2020 auction, the largest plant went to Qcells with 109 MW. Spain’s Endesa and Iberdrola have projects with 99 MW and 69 MW, respectively.  
If the country is to install 1,363 MW by the end of the year, as predicted by BNEF, a considerable share of the record-winning auction projects will have to go online, quickly.
The picture might look brighter in the years to come, with large-scale PPA and merchant projects scheduled to come online from 2024. Iberdrola and Prosalia, for example, have already secured an environmental permit from the Portuguese authorities to build a 1.2 GW solar plant in the municipality of Santiago de Cacém. It is expected to start commercial operations in 2025 and is set to become Europe's largest PV project.

The GreenRoof Vento allows for portrait and landscape module elevation at 10 degrees and 15 degrees with maximum module sizes of 2,400 mm x 1,350 mm. It can also be applied to existing rooftops.
“The new member of the K2 product family firstly ensures a firm footing and secondly – thanks to the greater distance from module to roof – reliably prevents shading caused by overgrown vegetation,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The feet provide a firm hold but are designed small enough so that moss and succulents continue to receive light and water so that they can continue to make their valuable contribution.”
The mounting system manufacturer plans to integrate the new solution in its PV project planning tool, K2 Base, by the end of the third quarter of 2023, for a quick and easy installation process.
According to a recent study, the output power of PV systems can be increased by up to 8% when installed on green roofs. The cooling effect through transpiration and evaporation from the plants, their ability to absorb dust, and the diffuse reflection of sunlight through the foliage, are the main factors determining this performance improvement.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/21/flywheel-mechanical-battery-with-32-kwh-of-storage-in-australia/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 21, 2023",Flywheel mechanical battery with 32 kWh of storage in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
New South Wales-based startup Key Energy has installed a 8 kW/32 kWh three-phase flywheel mechanical energy storage system at a property in the Sawyers Valley, just east of Perth.
The installation involved a single flywheel, which stores energy mechanically meaning it has no fire risks, can run around 11,000 cycles without capacity degradation and boasts a 20-year to 30-year lifespan. While these systems have low energy density, they are substantially more durable than lithium-ion based chemical batteries.

This was a major drawcard for the owner of the Sawyers Valley property, who wanted a system that did not pose a fire risk, could power their three-phase loads and provide energy security as blackouts frequently affect the area.
The project marks Key Energy’s fourth installation, with another two expected to be commissioned this year. In total, the company has installed around 16 flywheel systems with over 300 kWh of capacity, including at a boarding school and at gas company APA Group’s commercial off-grid device stations.
Key Energy says it aims to leverage this residential flywheel installation, as well as future projects, to qualify its technology for Western Australia's Stand Alone Power System (SAPS) program, run by state-owned utilities Western Power and Horizon Power. The program is part of the state’s broad strategy to replace its stringy regional network of poles and wires with renewable standalone alternatives, which usually include a solar array, battery and last-resort diesel generator. These systems have been found by the state to be far cheaper and significantly reduce carbon emissions.
Flywheel battery systems are usually installed underground – a lengthy and costly process. Key Energy previously worked with the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) to develop an above-ground enclosure for its storage systems. Key Energy says this has allowed it to shorten install times from one to two weeks with underground systems to just two days in the Sawyers Valley project.

Key Energy says it is also developing additional functionality for the flywheel, paving the way for virtual power plants (VPPs) which it believes could capitalise on the flywheel system’s robust cycling characteristics and long lifespan.
Key energy, founded in 2018, is based in the Sydney suburb of Chippendale and has a test site in nearby Alexandria. Since launching, it has attracted funding from the New South Wales government, City of Sydney and Energy Lab.
Key Energy’s flywheels are sourced from US-headquartered company Amber Kinetics, though the rest of the battery system is believed to be manufactured in Australia.

“Construction will begin this week,” an Alight spokesperson told pv magazine. “The solar plant should be operational in the second quarter of 2023.
The company said it will use non-recourse project financing for the project for the first time in Sweden. Traditionally, PPA-backed solar assets are financed with equity in the country.
“We secured a 12-year PPA,” the spokesperson said. “The plant will sell power at a fixed price that it's much lower than the average electricity price in Sweden over the past 12 months.”
In December, Alight and Neoen secured Sweden's largest power purchase agreement to date. The two companies agreed to sell power to Swedish clothing retailer H&M Group from a 90 MW solar plant, which is now under development in Hultsfred, Sweden.
In December 2021, Alight signed a five-year PPA for an 18 MW solar park with Swedish restaurant group Martin & Servera. And in June 2021, it signed a 10-year deal for an 8 MW solar park it wants to build at an unspecified location in southern Sweden.

The system utilizes a photoelectrochemical (PEC) device powered by an encapsulated triple cation perovskite-based photocathode and an alloy anode. The PEC system initially captures CO2 from a concentrated CO2 stream, simulated post-combustion flue gas, and atmospheric air. It then converts this CO2 into syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen (H2).
“The process operates by combining CO2-to-fuel reduction with selective oxidation of waste plastic-derived ethylene glycol (EG) to glycolic acid (GA), which has applications in pharmaceutical, food, and textile industries,” the scientists explained, noting that the alloy anode is used to catalyze EG oxidation. “Captured CO2 reduction is enabled by an immobilized molecular Co-phthalocyanine catalyst at the photocathode.”
The research team explained that the process works in combination with the selective oxidation of pre-treated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste plastics and also converts them into fuel chemicals. It claimed this is a crucial element of the system as the plastic donates electrons to the CO2. “The plastic breaks down to glycolic acid, which is widely used in the cosmetics industry, and the CO2 is converted into syngas, which is a simple fuel,” it stated.
The group also said the system is able to operate properly with a single visible-light absorber, without the need for an externally applied voltage. The photovoltaic device has an open-circuit voltage of 1.1 V and has the ability to absorb over a solar spectrum of 360 nm to 750 nm. “Replacing thermodynamically challenging water oxidation with EG oxidation is essential for the system to operate with a single light absorber without external voltage, which simultaneously enables waste PET upcycling,” it emphasized.
The scientists are currently developing a bench-top demonstrator device and said they are considering using solar cells with higher open-circuit voltage. They also hope to tune the counter oxidation and drive the oxidation of other biomass, textile, or chemical waste products.
The system is introduced in the study “Integrated capture and solar-driven utilization of CO2 from flue gas and air,” published in Joule. “With sufficient improvement, this proof-of-concept solar-driven CO2 capture and utilization system could be promising for future decentralized off-the-grid scalable solar fuels and chemical synthesis technologies,” the researchers concluded.

Every year, solar technical advisory HelioVolta releases a report on solar performance and safety. It assesses PV system health by using more than 60,000 data points, ranging from 100 kW projects to 350 MW arrays.
About 73% of the assessed projects in this year’s report are located on commercial rooftops, 25% are ground-mounted installations, and 2% are solar carports. All of the projects are located in the United States.
HelioVolta identified significant problem areas affecting the performance and safety of solar assets, with critical or major issues in a staggering 62% of inspected projects. About 91% of the major issues in projects with critical risks were found in DC distribution components.
“Issues can be fixed before they become hazardous. Periodic inspections and proactive O&M – especially in the DC distribution section of PV systems – are critical to safe and reliable operations,” said the report.
HelioVolta noted that inverters often appear to be the cause of PV system problems due to the fact they are typically the primary device of energy yield data and error messages.

Reports of a Chinese citizen's arrest at Munich Airport prior to the start of Intersolar Europe caused a stir last week at The Smarter E exhibition. The person – identified as a senior sales representative at a Chinese module manufacturer – is under investigation by the public prosecutor in Augsburg, Germany, for alleged crimes dating back to the 2015-17 period.
The suspect, along with other individuals under investigation, was allegedly involved in developing an illegal system to evade anti-dumping duties on imported Chinese solar modules. The accused is represented by lawyer Alexandra Gutmeyr.
The investigation by the Augsburg public prosecutor's office, which began several years ago, focuses on the alleged circumvention of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties. In April 2018, three suspects were arrested by customs investigators in connection with more than 400 imports of PV products from China into the European Union. The accused used intermediary companies in Greece and the Isle of Man to hide their operations, avoiding approximately €35 million ($38.2 million) in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties.
Minimum import prices for crystalline PV products, introduced in the European Union in 2013, expired in September 2018, in line with a decision by the EU Commission.

Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE has successfully developed a model of a heat pump refrigeration circuit using less than 150 g of propane.
“Many heat pump manufacturers offer propane heat pumps but mostly for outdoor installation only, since the refrigerant is subject to extensive safety regulations for in-door use due to its flammability,” Fraunhofer ISE said in a statement. “If a heat pump in a single-family home with its usual 5 kW to 10 kW of power exceeds the prescribed maximum of 150 grams of refrigerant charge, then it can be installed only by carrying out increased safety measures.”
One of the best results of the Low Charge 150 g (LC150) project is a brine heat pump with a heating capacity of 11.4 kW using only 146 g of propane, making it suitable for indoor use without undergoing extensive safety precautions. The refrigerant charge of the unit is 12.8 g/kW, which is about one-fifth the propane charge of commercially available systems, according to the German research institute.
“The project goal was to develop a nearly market-ready heat pump module which uses the climate-friendly refrigerant propane, does not exceed the 150-gram limit for indoor use, and yet still provides sufficient heat for single-family homes,” said Dr. Lena Schnabel, head of the heating and cooling department at Fraunhofer ISE. “We have now achieved this goal in cooperation with our industry partners and have given them the tools to develop a market-ready heat pump.”
The research consortium set up, measured, evaluated, and optimized more than 20 different combinations of heat exchangers and compressors. One of the key components in decreasing the required amount of propane was the use of an asymmetrical plate heat exchanger. Other factors included using less oil in the compressor and shortening the pipes’ length.
In October 2022, Fraunhofer ISE developed a heat pump with a heating capacity of 12.8 kW using only 124 grams of propane. However, its refrigeration circuit wasn’t suitable for commercialization because it used a semi-hermeneutic automatic compressor that couldn’t operate for enough hours.
The research institute now wants to develop low-charge propane heat pumps for use in multi-family homes, as part of the LC290 project running until June 30, 2025. The consortium aims to develop heat pump solutions for floor heating systems, indoor central heating systems, and high-performance, outdoor, heat pumps.
The projects are funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.

There has been plenty of progress, with both technological improvements and competition between manufacturers driving longer product and performance warranties, and therefore longer contracts for the sale of electricity from a solar project. Most manufacturers now offer 30-year warranties guaranteeing at least 80% of the modules’ initial performance, and one has even extended this to 40 years.
But for solar installations many regions are targeting, for 2050 and beyond, even longer lifetimes are needed, especially for installations located in harsh climate regions whether due to heat, cold, moisture, dust or other conditions. And this will mean understanding exactly how PV modules tend to degrade under these conditions.
Scientists led by the University of Agder in Norway decided to focus on degradation caused by moisture – this being a main characteristic of the climate in Grimstad where the university is based.
The group took modules from a decommissioned PV array installed in the town in 2000  and used a range of techniques, both non-destructive and destructive, to examine the inner workings of the modules, and how various components had fared over years in the field.
Their results are described in full in the paper “Moisture induced degradation in field-aged multicrystalline silicon photovoltaic modules,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. The study found moisture ingress had driven degradation of the encapsulant, producing acetic acid and various substances that drive corrosion and other forms of degradation to the silicon cells. Moisture was also found to have a major role in corrosion at solder joints – causing lead to corrosion rather than “sacrificial” tin included in the solder.
The scientists behind the work accepted that PV materials and manufacturing processes have moved on greatly since the modules in this study were manufactured more than 20 years ago. However, while accelerated testing is useful, they say that studying field-aged modules is still necessary, and that many mechanisms revealed in this study are still relevant to modules rolling off production lines today.
“Though solar PV module materials and technology have evolved over the years, MID mechanisms in solar PV modules appear to follow a similar trend,” they state in the paper. “Hence, insights from this work can guide decision making at the present and in the future as regards understanding the performance reliability of solar PV plants.”
