The electrolyser that splits water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen atoms is powered by renewable energy supplied by two photovoltaic plants, one located in the municipality of Lloseta (8.5 MW) and the other in Petra (5.85 MW),” Acciona Energía wrote on Thursday, adding that the plant will begin producing green hydrogen on an industrial scale at the beginning of 2022. It is set to produce at least 300 tons of renewable hydrogen per year, part of which will be distributed via Spain's first hydrogen pipeline.
A consortium of 13 companies led by Portuguese energy giants EPD and Galp has been selected by the European Commission as part of the Green Deal to develop 100MW of green hydrogen production in Sines, Portugal. The consortium will benefit from a €30 million grant. The construction of the hydrogen project will be located in the coal-fired power plant area in Sines. It should start in 2023 while the operation is expected to begin in 2025. “The 100 MW electrolyser will be composed of innovative, scalable and fast-cycling 8 MW modules to overcome bottlenecks such as efficiency, size, lifetime and flexibility,” one of the companies in the consortium wrote on Tuesday. The consortium is comprised of EDP, Galp, ENGIE, Bondalti, Martifer, Vestas Wind Systems, McPhy, and Efacec, as well as academic and research partners ISQ, INESC-TEC, DLR, and CEA.
UK-based Lightsource bp and Portuguese gas utility Dourogás have agreed to set up a joint venture to invest in solar and hydrogen infrastructure in Portugal. The partnership is set to explore the potential of eight green hydrogen sites. “As much as 200MWp of solar projects developed by Lightsource bp will power 130MW electrolysers, developed by Dourogás, that will convert water to green hydrogen and oxygen. The green hydrogen will be injected directly into the country’s gas grid. Further clean power could be drawn from the grid to optimise the usage of the electrolysers,” Lightsource bp wrote on Thursday, adding that Monforte, the first project with Dourogás, will benefit from a €5 million grant under the EU’s Portugal 2020 fund. Lightsource bp already has a solar pipeline in Portugal of around 1.5GW. It is also part of hydrogen consortiums in Australia and the UK. BP has a 50% stake in Lightsource bp.
US-based heavy equipment company Cummins and Beijing-headquartered oil and gas company Sinopec announced the formation of Cummins Enze, a 50:50 joint venture meant to accelerate the affordability and availability of green hydrogen. “Cummins Enze, located in Foshan, Guangdong Province in China, will initially invest $47 million (RMB 300 million – €41.5 million) to locate a manufacturing plant to produce proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. The plant will initially have a manufacturing capacity of 500 megawatts of electrolyzers per year upon completion in 2023, which will be gradually increased over the next five years to reach one gigawatt of manufacturing capacity per year;” Cummins wrote on Tuesday. Sinopec currently accounts for 14% of China’s hydrogen production. It has more than 30,000 gas stations in the country. Cummins wrote it has deployed more than 2,000 fuel cells and 600 electrolyzers globally.
Russia-based gas producer Novatek and Germany-headquartered energy company Uniper signed a Term Sheet on long-term supply of up to 1.2 million tons of low-carbon ammonia per annum to the German market. “The product price will be indexed to relevant European and global benchmarks,” Novatek wrote on Wednesday, adding that “low-carbon ammonia” will be produced at the planned Obskiy GCC (Gas Chemical Complex) project, which should include carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities. The ammonia would be then exported to the terminal in Wilhelmshaven. “We are now at the pre-FEED stage for a low-carbon ammonia and hydrogen plant with CCS facilities, and signing of term sheets for long-term supply demonstrates growing demand for low-carbon products, which is an essential precursor for the Final Investment Decision on this project. The plant will be located next to our LNG cluster in Yamal,” said Leonid Mikhelson, Chairman of Novatek.
German conglomerate Siemens has completed a feasibility study for Productora H2 Bolivia’s Pacha K’anchay green ammonia export project. “The study analyzed up to 420 MW of electrolysis capacity and found that green ammonia produced by the project can economically provide green ammonia to the global markets,” wrote Santa Cruz-based startup H2 Bolivia on Thursday. The project is in the Oruro-Bolivia region. The plant should consist of a solar farm, electrolyzers, and ammonia production.
Ark Energy Corporation, an Australia-based unit of Korea Zinc, has announced it will acquire a 100% interest in local wind and solar energy developer Epuron Holdings. “We will leverage our parent company’s strong balance sheet to expand Epuron’s existing business model and leverage the group’s internal demand from the production of green non-ferrous metals, and our own demand from green hydrogen production, to fast-track the build-out of Epuron’s development portfolio,” Yun B. Choi, Chairman of Ark Energy and Vice Chairman of Korea Zinc said on Thursday. The investment will allow Ark to access 4.2GW of early-stage projects and a further investigation pipeline of 4.8GW. In November, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) announced that it had conditionally approved $3.02 million (€1.93 million) in funding to Ark Energy H2 Pty to support the deployment of a 1MW electrolyzer with storage and refueling infrastructure to fuel five new 140 tonne rated fuel cell electric trucks. Korea Zinc aims to become the world's most competitive green hydrogen producer.
Australia’s largest rail freight operator Aurizon and mining company Anglo American have agreed to work together on a feasibility study to assess the introduction of hydrogen-powered trains for bulk freight. If the feasibility study is successful, the agreement between the two companies could be extended to the development of a hydrogen-fuelled heavy haul locomotive prototype. “The Feasibility Study will focus on the potential deployment of Anglo American’s hydrogen power technology on Aurizon’s Moura rail corridor that operates between Anglo American’s Dawson metallurgical coal mine and the Gladstone Port, and the Mount Isa rail corridor that operates between the North West Minerals Province to Townsville Port, via Aurizon’s Stuart Terminal,” wrote Aurizon early last week.
Australia’s Woodside Energy, Singapore’s Keppel Data Centres Holding, Singapore’s gas company City Energy, Osaka Gas Singapore, and City-OG Gas Energy Services have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to study the feasibility of a long-term, stable supply chain of sustainable Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) from Western Australia to Singapore and potentially Japan. The study is expected to continue until mid- 2022. “H2Perth is ideally located in Western Australia for shipping to Singapore and Japan and the project site is close to existing gas, power, water and port infrastructure, as well as a skilled local residential workforce,” commented Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill.
South Korea launched a one-year hydrogen truck pilot program in coordination with research institutes (Korea Research Institute for Land, Infrastructure and Transport, Korea Institute of Technology, AURI), and other experts. The initiative is part of the “Land Transport Carbon Neutral Roadmap”, which should be revised every five years to reflect policy implementation performance, market conditions, and technological progress. The government wants 500,000 electric and hydrogen vehicles for commercial use (buses, taxis, trucks) by 2030, and new hydrogen trains.

The manufacturing facility has an annual production capacity of 120 GWh. In 2020, CATL shipped batteries with a total capacity of 51.7 GWh. Along with the rapid growth of China’s EV market, the company has boosted its planned battery capacity, including capacity under production and to be built, to over 300 GWh.
Solar manufacturer Guangdong Aiko Solar Energy Technology has signed long-term purchasing contracts with several PV wafer manufacturers including Gokin Solar, Shuangliang Eco-Energy, and Jiangsu Meike. Through the three contracts, Aiko Solar secured a total of 4,515,000,000 wafers for the next three years.
Polysilicon supplier and solar cell maker Tongwei said its proposal to issue convertible bonds worth RMB12 billion (US$1.88 billion) was approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). The net proceeds will be used for polysilicon capacity expansion at factories in Sichuan and Inner Mongolia and a 15 GW ingot and wafer manufacturing facility.
Polysilicon manufacturer GCL-Poly on Wednesday completed a shares issuance to six new shareholders which it is expected will raise a net HK$4.99 billion (US$640 million). The company said HK$4.55 billion (US$583 million) would help finance two production facilities for the company’s granular silicon, which GCL claims are less energy-intensive than conventional fluidized bed reactor manufacturing methods. The company said HK$2.57 billion (US$329 million) of the fundraising proceeds would go towards a granular silicon project being developed in an unspecified location by its Jiangsu Zhongneng Polysilicon Technology Development Co Ltd business unit and HK$1.98 billion (US$254 million) would go to a similar fab being developed in Inner Mongolia. With the issuance of the shares having amounted to 7.52% of an enlarged GCL-Poly, the remaining cash will be kept for working capital.

The procurement exercise will be divided into lots ranging from 50MW to 300MW each.
Selected developers will be awarded a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) and each developer will be allowed to tender for one or more lots for a maximum cumulative capacity of 300MW.
The deadline to submit project proposals is April 30.
The tender will be held by Algerian Renewable Energy Company (SHAEMS), jointly owned by state-owned gas giant Sonatrach and power utility Sonelgaz, which will be allowed to take a share of up to 25% in the special purpose vehicles that will own the winning projects.
“Major global investors were waiting for this end-of-year good news,” Mouloud Bakli, the president of Algerian industry association CAPC Energia, told pv magazine. “Several things must be clarified yet, as for example PPA indexation on a foreign currency, arbitration, and the evaluation of local content requirements in the attribution criteria.”
In a previous interview with pv magazine, Bakli said the tender might conclude with prices ranging from DZD5/kWh (US$0.036) to DZD 7/kWh.
Local content requirements will be included in the procurement exercise, but they will not be mandatory for the first tender of the series, as the capacity of the local industry will only just exceed 1 GW by the end of 2022. Solar developers that use locally manufactured PV components may receive additional bonuses on top of the granted fixed tariff.
Another three tenders of the same size will likely be held each year between 2022 and 2024. Furthermore, a 500 MW solar tender was launched by Algerian utility Sonelgaz at the beginning of December.
In 2019, the Algerian government held tenders for off-grid, hybrid solar-diesel, and PV projects. The procurement rounds were part of the country’s plans to deploy 15 GW of solar energy generation capacity by 2030.
Algeria had around 423 MW of total installed solar capacity by the end of last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/24/an-overview-of-heterojunction-solar-cell-technologies/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",MARIJA MAISCH,"DECEMBER 24, 2021",An overview of heterojunction solar cell technologies,"In a paper published in the journal Nanophotonics, scientists at Nankai University provide an overview of current research on silicon heterojunction tandem solar cells (SHJ-TSCs), including perovskite/SHJ TSCs and III–V/SHJ TSCs, and highlight the opportunities and challenges of this technology.
According to their analysis, the big challenge for perovskite/SHJ TSCs is the open-circuit voltage (Voc ) loss, which is mainly caused by nonradiative recombination at the grain boundary and interface. To address this issue, a range of strategies have been applied to date including increasing grain size, surface passivation, 2D/3D heterojunction engineering, and ion compensation.
However, defects passivation has emerged as the most powerful means to improve Voc. A lot of research effort is currently focused on Lewis bases/acids, alkali metal ions (Na, K, Ru, Cs), ligand passivation, halogen ion (Cl, Br), PbI2, 2D perovskite, insulating polymers, and guanidinium-based additives, the review finds.
Another issue is fabricating perovskite top cells on textured c-Si cells, where the vacuum deposition method can yield good results, according to the study.
“To further improve the TSCs performance, optical and electron losses have to be minimized. If these issues are solved, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 35% can be expected,” the review reads. For up-scaling fabrication and commercialization, long-term stability and material toxicity are also needed to be optimized, said the Chinese scientists.
Unlike perovskites, III–V compound semiconductor materials, with their proven reliability and adjustable bandgap, exhibit high efficiency and promising potential for industrial application. However, they are plagued by high costs.
So far, many strategies have been used to fabricate III–V/SHJ TSCs, including heteroepitaxial growth, wafer bonding, and mechanical stacking. The heteroepitaxial integration approach based on the control of dislocation densities at the interface has been used to produce devices, but their quality was poor. Approaches based on surface activated bonding (SAB) seem to be most versatile in fabricating high efficiency III–V/SHJ TSCs. This method, however, is not appropriate for use with textured SHJ solar cells, and the requirement of a cleanroom environment and tunnel junction may also cause high cost.
Therefore, mechanical stacking by transparent conductive adhesive and metal nanoparticle array may be a new research direction for high-performance III–V/SHJ TSCs, the review states. However, it concludes that all the approaches described need to be improved in terms of performance and cost before they can be widely used in commercial applications.

Hotspots as well, where one cell or even part of a cell runs at a higher temperature leading to various types of damage, are high on the list of worries for the solar industry.
Plenty of work has gone into understanding and mitigating both issues in recent years, and a link between the two has previously been established – there can be multiple causes for hotspots, but they are more likely to form in cracked cells. Scientists at the University of York and the University of Huddersfield in the UK decided to take a closer look at the link between cell cracking and hotspots.
The group analyzed cells with different levels of cracking, noting that their research is the first to divide cells into four ‘modes’ based on their level of cracking – no cracking, microcracks, shaded area, and breakdown. The cells were put through various stages of testing and characterization to observe the formation of hotspots – detailed in the paper An empirical investigation on the correlation between solar cell cracks and hotspots, published in Scientific Reports.
Results showed that hotspots did not form in the first two cells with no or less severe cracking, while the two more severely cracked modes saw an increase in temperature from 25 up to 100 degrees Celsius, and a significantly higher likelihood of hotspots. Their research also revealed more about the known relationship between partial shading and hotspots, enabling them to state that shading ratios between 40% and 60% come with similar temperature increases to severe cracking and the formation of severe hotspots.

Sydney-based solar startup SunDrive, which created the most efficient commercial-sized silicon solar cell in the world in September, has taken to social media to announce its latest feat – the successful fabrication of its first full-size solar panel. 
From a garage in Sydney’s south, SunDrive’s chief executive started the company with former flatmate David Hu in 2015 based on a solution developed while completing his PhD at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), adding another chapter to UNSW’s storied solar history. 
The solution, reached by hundreds of experiments in trial and error, amounts to a major shakeup of the solar industry’s Chinese cell manufacturing supremacy and replaces traditional and expensive silver use in solar cells with the much more abundant and much cheaper copper. Copper is not as conductive as silver, nor as adhesive to the solar cell, but Allen’s solution rectifies this disparity as evidenced by its 25.54 world efficiency record confirmed by the German Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH). 
This week’s announcement that SunDrive has successfully fabricated its first full-size panel is another major milestone on the company’s journey from photovoltaic breakthrough to commercial success. 
“From our process engineers interconnecting every cell to our build team designing the tools to make all this possible, everyone has put in immense effort to making this a reality,” the company said in a post on LinkedIn. “We are now gearing up to fully automate our technology as we continue to grow our world class team.” 
The big “If” of SunDrive has always been whether it can mass produce its technology. If so, the Aussie startup could usher in the next great solar panel cost reduction while also lessening the industry’s dependence on silver, a precious metal of rapidly increasing price. 
Silver is central to today’s solar panels. It is estimated solar panel manufacturing accounts for approximately 20% of the world’s annual consumption, a figure which is only going to increase thanks to the next generation of high-efficiency cells which can require up to three times more silver than previous generations.

Allen has previously said SunDrive’s aim is to produce the cells locally, optimistic that they can compete with large solar manufacturers in Asia while protecting their intellectual property.
“The industry today is at a point where the land and labor costs are becoming less and less significant in the total cost of manufacturing … obviously it does mean that we need to at least match that similar level of automation and throughput, but we do see opportunity to do it in Australia,” he said.

On top of more than $2 million in grants from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), SunDrive has already attracted high-profile investors, including Australian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes’s Grok Ventures.

The Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) and Northrop Grumman’s Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research (SSPIDR) Project announced that it is one step closer to collecting solar power in space and beaming it to Earth using radio frequency (RF).
In the first end-to-end demonstration of key hardware for the Arachne flight experiment, a team used components for the “sandwich tile” to convert solar energy to RF. Arachne is a flight experiment conducted as part of an AFRL project that aims to develop technologies for a space-based solar transmission system that can power a Forward Operating Base on the ground.
To power a base, solar will be collected by Arachne using high-efficiency solar PV cells that is converted to RF energy using the sandwich tile. The power will be beamed to a receiving station at the base on the ground, and the energy is collected by a rectifying antenna or “rectenna” that will rectify and convert the RF into usable power. The sandwich tiles are key to the process and the design eliminates the need for heavy power banks.
The demonstration of the sandwich tile is one important step in the process. The tiles are comprised of photovoltaics to collect solar energy and RF tiles to emit RF energy, along with electronics that enable solar-to-RF conversion. The sandwich tile has been under development since 2018 as a part of a contract awarded to Northrop Grumman by AFRL.
“The successful conversion of sunlight into RF energy in a lightweight and scalable architecture is a significant step forward in delivering the technology building blocks to achieve the Arachne mission,” said Jay Patel, vice president, remote sensing programs business unit, Northrop Grumman. “We are helping to deliver a pioneering capability that can provide a strategic advantage to our forces around the globe.”
The ground demonstration used a solar simulator to illuminate the PV side of the tile and begin the Solar-to-RF conversion process.
Successful testing of the individual tile for the Arachne payload provides a building block for a square meter panel of tiles – a threshold that has not yet been met by any other solar-to-RF experiments. Arachne is anticipated to launch in 2025.
