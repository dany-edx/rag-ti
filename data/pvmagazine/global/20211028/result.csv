U.S. solar panel imports plunged during Q3, falling 27%, the largest single-quarter drop since 2018, according to research firm Panjiva.
In addition to being down 27% compared to Q2 2021, total module shipments were also down 11%, compared to Q3 2020. Many in the industry are blaming the fall on a proposed expansion of tariffs, introduced by an anonymous group of domestic manufacturers last month.
The proposed tariffs would apply to manufacturers in Southeast Asia beyond just China, including modules that are imported from Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. Those countries account for 80% of all panel imports into the United States.

An average selling price of RMB53.2/kg ($8.32) for GCL's conventional rod silicon, in the first six months of last year, had more than doubled by the end of June, to RMB108.2 ($16.93). There was a similar, if less spectacular trend for the price of GCL's wafers too, which were shifting for an average RMB0.353/W ($0.055) in the first half of last year but would have set you back RMB0.530 ($0.083) in the January-to-June period just gone.
That was the main reason the heavily-indebted business – which is still in default thanks to its involvement in “several” litigation cases, according to its 2020 accounts – was able to post a first-half profit of RMB2.53 billion ($396 million), on the back of gross profits of RMB3.6 billion ($563 million) and six-month revenue of RMB8.78 billion ($1.37 billion).
As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing for the energy storage industry. You can read about materials sourcing for batteries, lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and you can contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
The timeliness of that uptick was revealed in the full-year figures for a tough 2020 which were finally released on Monday, and which revealed an annual loss last year of RMB6.27 billion ($981 million) and left the company with a then-current assets-to-liabilities deficit of RMB17.2 billion ($2.69 billion) at the end of December.
Last year, GCL revealed, it manufactured 42,189 metric tons of polysilicon, generating revenue of RMB2.21 billion ($346 million); and 31,449 MW of solar wafers, to drum up RMB5.69 billion ($890 million), with the two income streams adding up to an annual loss of RMB4.87 billion ($762 million). In the first half of this, rising prices meant the 23,284 tons of poly produced – and 18,712 MW of wafers – generated RMB6.78 billion ($1.06 billion) for a solar materials division profit of RMB2.43 billion ($380 million).
GCL was eager to point out it has the capacity to produce 10,000 tons per year of its new granular silicon, which the company is touting as the key to truly ‘green' solar manufacturing, as it requires around two-thirds less electricity to produce than silicon manufactured using the Siemens method. GCL's granular product requires only 18 kWh of power per kilogram to make, according to GCL's first-half figures report for this year.
As a result, the 10,000 ton granular silicon plant GCL has up and running at Xuzhou, is set to be expanded to 30,000t this year, and 54,000t next year. The company also has agreements in place to jointly invest in a RMB18 billion ($2.82 billion), 300,000t fab in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, alongside mono wafer maker Wuxi Shangji Automation Co Ltd.
Those higher polysilicon and wafer prices, plus a continuing drive to sell off its GCL New Energy solar park estate, ensured GCL-Poly was able to reduce its big debt pile from RMB22.9 billion ($3.58 billion) of borrowings due within 12 months at the end of last year, to RMB10.7 billion ($1.67 billion) of current commitments at the end of June. Similarly, longer-term borrowings of RMB13.4 billion ($2.1 billion) at the end of December had come in to RMB6.25 billion ($978 million) six months later.
But there are still payment deadlines to be met, the next of them for an $11 million loan on November 9. That is the outstanding amount left over from a $100 million loan repayment which GCL failed to settle on time on June 23 and August 20, the company subsequently securing a stay of execution by handing over $89 million.
The business has been busily selling off its Chinese solar farms to state-owned entities, with 69 project companies divested by the time the overdue set of financials was published, to generate RMB4.98 billion ($779 million), and with agreements in place to get rid of another 25 project companies for another RMB1.05 billion ($164 million). The associated windfall meant GCL's New Energy business turned a RMB1.26 billion ($197 million) loss in 2020 into a first-half profit of RMB160 million ($25 million).
With the parent company identifying RMB9.48 billion ($1.48 billion) of “assets held for sale” in its first-half figures, its rump 2.9 GW of solar generation capacity at the end of June appears set to shrink still further, as part of a planned transformation into an “assets light” operation, not least because those solar farms with the for sale signs carry an associated RMB6.37 billion ($997 million) of liabilities.
GCL-Poly will hope to soon be able to resume trading in its stock on the Hong Kong exchange after finally pushing its problematic 2020 and first-half numbers out of the door.
This article was amended on 29/10/21 to reflect GCL's usage of the figure MT reflects “metric tons,” rather than million tons or megatons, as previously indicated. The statement GCL produced 36,000 tons of granular silicon in the first half of this year was also inaccurate, and has been removed.

That was the main takeaway of an event organized by Italy’s electric industry group, Elettricità Futura, at the Key Energy renewables fair in Rimini.
“Today's event also confirmed the importance of strengthening the dialogue between Italy and Europe, particularly concerning the new measures introduced by the Fit for 55 [EU emissions reduction] package,” said Roberta Valenziani, marketing manager at Elettricità Futura.
Pick up your copy of the latest edition of pv magazine for an in-depth look at the fire hazard concern of lithium-ion battery systems, with a focus on the blaze at Australia’s Victorian Big Battery which caught the world’s attention. Also, Saul Griffith, the guru of electrification, talks to pv magazine about reshaping the climate conversation; we delve into the evolution of residential PV in China; and we continue our coverage of global PV supply-chain issues and ask: Is there an alternative to Made in China?
The EU's 27 energy ministers this week failed to reach agreement on a common approach to addressing soaring energy bills, having called an emergency summit on the matter.
Stefano Grassi, head of the team of EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson, told the meeting renewable energy is taking on “renewed geopolitical importance.” He said traditional, broader divergences between the U.S., Russia, and China are becoming evident on climate, with the divide obvious in the run-up to the COP26 climate change summit, which is due to start in Glasgow on Sunday.
“This is not an energy crisis due to the transition to cleaner energy sources,” Grassi told pv magazine. “The EU is in a particularly vulnerable position because we are still too dependent on imports of fossil fuels.” He added, the European Commission is particularly interested in triggering and supporting the unsubsidized power purchase agreement market for renewables “to smooth price volatility for companies,” and said clean power was seen as able to deliver “the cheapest form of electricity production.”
According to figures supplied by Elettricità Futura's Valenziani, Italy has 57 GW of renewable energy generation capacity and is projected to reach 127 GW this decade. Utility scale solar projects make up half of the expected additional capacity, with distributed generation arrays expected to supply an additional 15 GW, and wind power 13 GW. Elettricità Futura expects 5 GW from innovative renewables projects, including agrivoltaics.
On the latter topic, Valenziani was eager to clear up misconceptions about the possible loss of agricultural land. “The 35 GW of photovoltaic plants on the ground by 2030 will involve an area of 50,000 hectares, of which only a part will be on agricultural land,” she said yesterday, at the solar show held as part of the Ecomondo expo. “However, even if all the 35 GW were realized on agricultural land, only 0.3% of the total agricultural land – or 1.4% of the agricultural land already abandoned today – would be used.”
Italy’s electric industry has repeatedly called for a deep overhaul of the planning process related to renewables and such reform could be key to installing 70 GW of clean power capacity by 2030.
“Italy is the European country with the longest delays and highest costs for obtaining a permit,” said Valenziani. “Nearly 50% of permit applications do not become facilities, and the other 50% become facilities with almost six years' delay.”
Supply chain problems permitting, the current high conventional energy prices are also expected to drive deployment of energy storage projects.
Referring to Italian climate change policy the Piano Nazionale Integrato per l'Energia e il Clima, Valenziani told pv magazine: “The PNIEC 2020 has as its objective the realization of 10 GW of new storage by 2030: 4 GW of small batteries [and] 6 GW of pumped [hydro] storage and large scale electrochemical storage. However, to achieve the additional 70 GW of RES [renewable energy systems] capacity that we believe necessary to achieve the EU targets for 2030, more storage capacity is needed. This would require significant private investment, which Elettricità Futura estimates to be in the order of €25 billion.”
Elettricità Futura welcomed the Italian legislative decree which, if approved, will transpose EU Market Directive (2019/944) into national law. The directive, issued in June 2019, amends the rules governing the EU's electricity market to reflect a pivot away from fossil fuels towards clean energy.
“The [Italian] decree provides for the launch of procedures for the construction of new storage capacity,” said Valenziani. “However, it is essential that these procedures are competitive and aimed at market operators, and that [Italian electricity transmission system operator] Terna‘s participation is limited exclusively [to] situations of real and effective market failure.”

French energy giant TotalEnergies has energized, last week, a 240 kW agrivoltaic demonstrator plant in Channay, in the Côte-d'Or department of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region of northeastern France.
The project was developed with the support of German start-up Next2Sun Mounting Systems, with which TotalEnergies signed an exclusive partnership agreement in March 2020.
The demonstrator integrates Next2sun mounting structure technology for bifacial vertical panels and the solar modules for the project were provided by Russian heterojunction panel maker Hevel Solar. According to the project developers, this configuration provides maximum performance at peak times, at dawn and dusk, while stabilizing the network.
“Our partnership with Next2Sun is finally materializing through this demonstrator,” said Thierry Muller, managing director of TotalEnergies Renouvelables France. “We are very enthusiastic about the idea of implementing these innovative solutions, developed with our partner InVivo, which combine agricultural production and renewable electricity.”
The small solar park benefited from crowdfunding to the tune of €50,000, 42% of which was collected from residents of the municipalities of Channay and Nicey. TotalEnergies have joined forces with specialists by forming a working group bringing together the Chamber of Agriculture of Côte d'Or, the local cooperative Dijon Céréales, the agronomic study office Agrosolutions, and a subsidiary of InVivo, as well as agroecology innovation center AgrOnov.
The French energy company will also carry out environmental monitoring studies with its environmental studies and expertise center (P3E) and its Lacq Study and Research Center (PERL). These tests and analysis carried out on this pilot project will allow the group and its partners to benefit from experience feedback to develop more agrivoltaic projects.

The 250 kW/1 MWh AirBattery system will be connected to a PV system located nearby and will be used for behind-the-meter services by the collective community of Yahel, in the southern, desert part of Israel.
“As part of the test run operations, all system components were activated independently and in sequence, a number of charge and discharge cycles were performed, culminating in electricity generation,” Augwind CEO Or Yogev told pv magazine. “This is the first time since the feasibility study at Yakum that the AirBattery system is being tested on a commercial scale of 1 megawatt-hour, this is a significant milestone for Augwind in its technological roadmap, ahead of the construction of high-voltage commercial projects in the future.”
The system works according to the same principles of Augwind's large scale projects. It is based on two compression inflatable polymer tanks that are placed in the ground close to each other, in addition to a series of storage tanks. The tanks are covered by steel frames, which create a sort of cage around them, and these are then placed in holes at a depth of 4m.
Renewable energy is used to power standard water pumps, which inject water into the compression tanks. The tanks are sealed, so the air they contain starts to be compressed up to the top and then shifts to the storage tanks. With on-demand energy, the compressed air is released from the storage tanks to drive a powerful water turbine which is used to generate electricity.
 
“The 250 kW/1 MWh system is [a] first of its kind combination of pumped-hydro and compressed-air energy storage in a modular and scalable technical approach that can provide distributed, long-duration energy storage for a variety of applications,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The AirBattery is using circular water and air as raw materials, with pumps and turbine for power charge and discharge, and compressed-air as the storage element, implemented with Augwind’s proprietary underground tanks, enabling dual land use above the system.”
Compressed air energy storage (CAES) may become an interesting solution for countries such as Israel, with weak interconnection with their neighbors, according to scientists from Finland’s Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT). Crucial for the identification of an ideal location for large scale CAES projects, should be the proximity to renewable energy infrastructure and the electric grid.

The agency said it will now begin talks with the renewable energy industry to analyze the tender's disappointing result and to evaluate if more tenders of this kind should be held, starting from next year. “The analysis will incorporate experience from previous tenders and will also provide an overall status of unsubsidized renewable energy projects in Denmark,” the agency said in a statement. “It will also provide an overall picture of the expected growth of renewable energies until 2024.”
“Funds have been reserved for technology-neutral tenders in 2022-2024 as part of the Danish climate agreement from 2020,” a spokesperson from the agency told pv magazine. “However, with the climate agreement, the political parties also agreed to analyze the need for technology-neutral tenders after 2021.” The national budget for renewables auctions for 2020-2024 is DKK4.2 billion ($655 million).
The agency had allocated DKK1.2 billion ($187 million) for the procurement exercise, a sum that was considered sufficient to allocate around 429 MW of renewable energy capacity. Selected projects would have been eligible for a feed-in premium – related to the wholesale electricity price – for 20 years.
In the first auction of the kind, held in 2018, 20-year power purchase agreements were awarded to three solar plants with a combined generation capacity of 104 MW and three wind facilities with 165 MW of capacity. The Danish Energy Agency received 17 bids in that procurement round – for 280 MW worth of solar capacity and 260 MW of wind. The weighted average price premium of the winning bids was DKK0.0227/kWh ($0.0035).
In the second exercise, held in 2019, the agency allocated 252 MW of clean energy generation capacity, of which 83 MW was solar and 93 MW solar-wind hybrid facilities which included 34.1 MW of PV capacity. The weighted average price premium, which is paid for the power generated by the projects on top of spot market prices, was DKK0.0154/kWh ($0.0024).
Currently, there are several unsubsidized solar projects under development in the Scandinavian country. Better Energy has already built a 50 MW solar project under a long-term power purchase agreement in Denmark that is powering an Apple data center in Viborg. Furthermore, Danish clothing company Bestseller announced in 2019 it was partnering with independent power producer Better Energy for the construction of a 125 MW solar facility to power its operations.
The Scandinavian country also has other subsidy-free solar installations under development, including a 400 MW solar project near Nissum Fjord, a 500 MW installation that Encavis and Greengo agreed to develop in May, and a 200 MW PV plant in Holstebro municipality.

The researchers explained that the reverse-bias behavior of perovskite solar cells has been almost ignored by previous research, even though it impacts long-term stability and prevents devices from reaching commercial maturity. “Defective or current-mismatched PV cells can be considered as the intrinsic origins of the creation of hotspots in modules, while partial shading of a PV module during its operation is considered an extrinsic and often-occurring cause of reverse-bias-induced degradation,” they stated. “In previous studies, a negative voltage applied to conventional perovskite solar cell stacks resulted in breakdown and irreversible destruction of the device.”
The solar cells were built on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate coated with titanium dioxide (c-TiO2), an electron selective layer made of mesoporous titanium dioxide (m-TiO2), a zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) insulating spacer layer, and a graphite electrode. “Carbon-based electrodes are not prone to melting at high temperature, neither to migration of (metal) ions from the electrode into the perovskite absorber, nor to electrode oxidation, which makes them an ideal candidate for improving the stability of perovskite solar cells,” the scientists highlighted.
Through dark I–V measurements, they found that the cells' breakdown voltage is approximately −3.6 V, and that the devices, however, degrade only when the reverse-bias exceeds −9 V. The research team identified, in particular, two different degradation mechanisms related to reverse-bias: an iodine loss due to hole tunneling into the perovskite, which occurs at low reverse-bias and decomposes the perovskite in the cell only after long time durations; and the formation of lead(II) iodide (PbI2), which is caused by local heating during large reverse-bias and is responsible for shunting effects.
The cells were then used to fabricate a 10×10cm2 perovskite solar module with carbon-based back-contacts. Its reverse-bias behavior was analyzed through a hotspot test following the IEC 61215:2016 international standard. “Passing this accelerated test for the first time confirms the superior stability of perovskite PV devices with carbon-based electrodes and highlights their large industrialization potential,” the researchers affirmed, adding that the issue of the cell destruction under reverse stress has now been “overcome.”
Their findings are presented in the paper Perovskite Photovoltaic Devices with Carbon-Based Electrodes Withstanding Reverse-Bias Voltages up to –9 V and Surpassing IEC 61215:2016 International Standard, published in RRL Solar.
The research group also comprises academics from the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Swiss technology company Solaronix SA, and the Freiburg Materials Research Center (FMF) at the University of Freiburg.

India added approximately 8,811 MW of new solar capacity in the first nine months of 2021, about 280% more than in the same period a year earlier. Newly deployed wind capacity was 101% higher at 1,246 MW, according to JMK Research.
The analysts attribute the significant growth to the commissioning of the projects that were stretched beyond their due date because of the Covid-19 disruption.
India’s overall installed renewable energy capacity has reached 101.53 GW as of September 30, 2021. Solar energy, with a 46% share, is the biggest contributor to this capacity, followed by wind energy (39%), biomass (10%) and small hydro (5%).
JMK Research expects India to install approximately 11 GW of new utility scale solar capacity and around 3 GW of rooftop PV if the third wave of the covid-19 pandemic does not strike the country between November and December 2021.
The state of Rajasthan led new utility-scale solar installations during the period with state-level addition close to 2.5 GW.
In the rooftop solar segment, about 2,068 MW of new capacity was added in the nine months period, which is 134% more than in the same period of the previous year.
“The ‘Surya Urja Rooftop Yojana – Gujarat' scheme is the key reason for this significant capacity addition in Gujarat that aims installation of solar rooftops for 8 lakh residential consumers by March 2022,” stated JMK report. “Under this scheme, 40% of state subsidy is provided on installation of systems up to 3 kW and 20% subsidy for 3 kW- 10 kW system size.”

Lumea, the commercial arm of AustralianMega transmission network operator TransGrid, said commissioning of the $61.9 million Wallgrove Grid Battery has begun after it achieved registration with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) earlier this week.
The 50 MW/75 MWh lithium-ion battery has been installed adjacent to Transgrid’s Wallgrove substation in Western Sydney and Lumea anticipates it will deliver important lessons with large-scale batteries expected to play a big role in firming and balancing Australia’s electricity system as the nation moves towards a future energy mix with higher penetration of renewable energy.
Featuring 36 Tesla Megapack units connected to transformers and with a direct feed to the National Energy Market (NEM), the lithium ion battery energy storage system will trial the use of ‘synthetic inertia’ as a service as well as provide grid support and system strength to the energy network.
Lumea said the Wallgrove battery will demonstrate how batteries can be used to respond to a frequency event, and how often it is needed to provide fast-frequency response and system inertia – termed synthetic or digital inertia when delivered by battery storage. It will also demonstrate how batteries can be used as a new source of dispatchable power, how much electricity it is able to store and dispatch under different conditions.
Lumea spokesman Nigel Buchanan said the battery will also be monitored to see how it responds to frequency deviations that occur as a result of incidents on the network.
“High-speed monitors on the network pick up the data and we expect to see a very fast, anticipatory response from the battery,” he said.
Buchanan said current batteries work retroactively, so that when frequency spikes or drops and moves outside a particular frequency band, then the battery is triggered and provides active power into the network to rectify the frequency deviation.
New technology in the Wallgrove battery is expected to detect a change in the property of the electricity flowing in the network.
“We’ll be monitoring to see how well the battery anticipates that within half a second that the frequency will have moved outside the particular band and automatically kicks in to arrest that change and hopefully moderate the frequency deviation and head off the incident,” Buchanan said.
“The point is we already know that Australia can build synchronous condensers for hundreds of millions of dollars, but we want the data from Wallgrove to say, batteries do work as an alternative, preferable solution.”

Modeling by TransGrid and Lumea suggests within the next energy market regulatory period, between 2024 and 2029, New South Wales is likely to need 240 MW of battery inertia to address the gap left once fossil fuel generators are retired. At 50 MW the Wallgrove battery will go some way to helping.
“What we are proving with the Wallgrove battery is the complementarity of the battery’s role not just for market solutions such as energy storage and dispatch, but a simultaneous role for network operations such as inertia,” Buchanan said.
“When these batteries are operating in ‘inertia mode’, it’s literally less than a second up to no more than six seconds, but you need a huge amount of power for that very short period.
“What that means is we can provide those short bursts without interrupting provision of other market services.”
The Wallgrove Grid Battery is expected to be fully operational in early 2022.
TransGrid will own and maintain the battery while Iberdrola, which also operates the Lake Bonney big battery in South Australia, will provide commercial services to the energy market, including dispatch control and FCAS and wholesale energy markets.

The gravity-based energy storage tower developed by Energy Vault has reached commercialization, with the company signing an agreement with DG Fuels to supply 1.6 GWh of energy storage.
The tower will be charged with solar photovoltaic energy. The dispatched storage will support the creation of renewable hydrogen, biogenic based, synthetic aviation fuel, and diesel fuel.
The agreement is estimated to provide Energy Vault with $520 million in revenues across three projects. The first, a 500 MWh storage tower in Louisiana, is expected to commence in mid-2022. Additional projects are planned in British Columbia and Ohio.
Energy Vault’s design includes a six-armed crane tower that lifts composite blocks using an electric (solar-powered) motor. The lifted blocks are stacked, which creates potential energy. As the blocks are lowered, the energy is harvested and dispatched for use.
The tower is controlled by computer systems and machine vision software that orchestrate the charging and discharging cycles. A range of storage durations from two to 12 hours or longer is achievable, said the company.
Energy Vault said the tower’s design is based on the physics of pumped hydroelectric energy storage. However, as a solid “mobile mass,” the composite blocks do not lose storage capacity over time. The company said the tower has an 85% round-trip efficiency and a 35-year-plus technical life.
The composite blocks can be made cheaply, said the company, using excavated soil from the construction site, waste materials like mine tailings and coal ash, and even fiberglass from decommissioned wind turbines.
DG Fuels will deploy the storage systems to power its carbon conversion fuel process. The company said it is targeting a 93% carbon efficiency rate for its aviation fuel. It will also use the tower’s energy to power water electrolysis for both hydrogen and oxygen feedstock production.
