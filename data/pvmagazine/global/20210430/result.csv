Spain's Sorigué and Hungary-based Platio Solar developed the winning technology.
The pilot project will be used to assess the potential of solar paving materials. The 340 mm x 340 mm x 61 mm solar panels feature electrical wiring and are covered with a highly resistant, non-slip glass. The modules function as normal urban paving stones that can be walked on. However, they have a combined power capacity of 9 kW.
In this first pilot test, the pavement will power a public bicycle rental service in Barcelona, in order to monitor the energy that is generated in real time. The developers expect to generate 7,560 kWh of electricity per year, which is equivalent to the total energy consumption of three households. A municipal commission will evaluate the results for a period of six months to determine the potential of installing the tech in other parts of the city.

The electrolyzer would run on renewable energy produced, among other generation sources, by a 40 MW photovoltaic plant,” reads a statement released on Wednesday. The BP refinery in Castellón is the largest consumer of hydrogen in the Valencian Community. The new project would allow the use of green hydrogen instead of gray hydrogen, which the refinery uses to produce biofuels. The project also envisages hydrogen supplies for the heavy transport sector. In later phases, the electrolysis capacity could be increased to 115 MW.
The Danish developer of wind and solar parks, European Energy, joined the Danish industry organization Hydrogen Denmark in its effort to increase its hydrogen and PtX businesses. “Their competencies in the development, construction and operation of green energy parks are very valuable in relation to upscaling and implementation of hydrogen and PtX production in Denmark,” Hydrogen Denmark director Tejs Laustsen Jensen commented in a note released on Wednesday.
At the 13th German-Russian Raw Materials Conference, Russian and German representatives called for greater hydrogen cooperation. “The main topics of the German-Russian Raw Materials Conference have changed considerably in recent years. Today, we mainly discuss renewable energies and hydrogen,” Saxony's Prime Minister Michael Kretschmer commented on the second day of the three-day virtual conference. German Economics Minister Peter Altmaier had similar comments: “We must not forget Russia's enormous potential for renewable energies from wind and sun. Germany will have to rely on imports in the hydrogen sector. We have reserved a total of 2 billion euros for international cooperation. This is also available for projects between Russian and German companies. Russia can become an important part of an international hydrogen economy,” commented Altmaier. The conference ends Friday.
Automotive manufacturers Hyundai, Stellantis, Toyota and BMW sent a letter to European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans asking to support the continued expansion of a 700 bar hydrogen refuelling network in Europe. “The undersigned OEMs [Original Equipment Manufacturer] are dedicated to further develop the fuel cell passenger car and light commercial vehicle market. This in turn, will require an expansion of the established (and proven) 700 bar refuelling network. The combined roll-out of a common hydrogen infrastructure offering both refuelling options for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, as well as heavy-duty trucks, can create enormous synergies,” reads the letter dated April 26.
Daimler’s heavy commercial vehicles unit, Daimler Truck, and Gothenburg-headquartered Volvo Group presented the fuel-cell joint venture cellcentric as part of their commitment to accelerate the use of hydrogen-based fuel cells for long-haul trucks. “With the ambition of becoming a leading global manufacturer of fuel-cell systems, cellcentric will build one of Europe’s largest planned series production of fuel-cell systems, with operation planned to commence in 2025,” reads the note released on Thursday. According to the two companies, battery-electric will be the preferential option for lower cargo weights and for shorter distances, while fuel-cell power will be mostly adopted for heavier loads and longer distances.
Clean electrification will be at the heart of the energy transition enabled by the rapidly falling costs of renewable energy, with a complementary role for clean hydrogen technology in sectors that are difficult or impossible to electrify, the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC), a coalition of more than 45 companies active in the energy sector said in two reports published earlier this week. “Total global hydrogen use could … grow 5-7-fold from today’s 115 Mt per annum to reach 500 to 800 Mt by mid-century, with hydrogen (and its derivatives) accounting for 15-20% of final energy demand, on top of the close to 70% provided by direct electricity,” reads the report, adding that green hydrogen would be lower cost in most locations over the long term, “with dramatic production cost reductions to below $2/kg possible during the 2020s, and further falls thereafter.” Green hydrogen is expected to account for 85% of total hydrogen production by 2050. Electricity currently represents 20% of the final energy demand.
Australia's Smart Energy Council has revealed the names of the eight initial global and domestic partners for its hydrogen Zero Carbon Certification Scheme. The scheme seeks to provide a guarantee of origin for hydrogen, ammonia and other derivative products like steel. The Council announced that its first pilot certification project will be ActewAGL’s hydrogen refuelling station in Canberra. The project, which opened in March, is expected to be certified under the Council’s scheme by the end of July 2021. Virtually from the outset, the German Energy Agency (dena) has been an adviser for the Council’s scheme.
Sydney-based technology startup Lavo is working on its expansion into Germany, described as a key international market for the company. Lavo's German subsidiary will be based in Berlin. “Lavo’s growth plans in Germany includes the launch of the logistical mobility solution that will be the Lavo cargo bike, the first commercially produced hydrogen bicycle. Increased consumer facing hydrogen products and business initiatives will benefit from the landmark agreement between Australia and Germany in September 2020 to explore the potential for collaboration on hydrogen supply,” reads a note released on Tuesday.
Melbourne-based hydrogen production and supply company Trojan H2 Logistics has announced two separate industry deals in Australia’s hydrogen transportation sector. Trojan has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the delivery of 100 refuelling stations as well as a €2.3 million (AU$3.6 million) agreement to immediately acquire two liquid hydrogen trailers capable of holding around 55,000 litres. It has also signed a second MoU for the supply of 50 hydrogen prime movers, with a plan to purchase another 1,000 trucks conditional to demand. The company’s press release does not name the partnering companies for either of the MoUs, but the company’s website says it has agreements in place with both US-based manufacturer of engineered equipment Chart Industries and supplier of zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell-powered commercial vehicles Hyzon Motors.
Hyzon Motors, a New York State-based supplier of hydrogen fuel cell-powered commercial vehicles, signed an MoU with Wyoming-based renewable fuels company Raven SR. The two plan to create a joint venture and build up to 100 hydrogen production centres “across the United States and globally”. The aim is to convert organic waste into hydrogen. The companies expect conversion costs to be similar to hydrogen produced using hydrocarbons. As part of the deal, Hyzon will acquire a minority interest in Wyoming-based Raven. “The first hubs will be built in the San Francisco Bay Area and are expected to commission in 2022,” Raven SR wrote in a note released on Tuesday. Last October, Total Carbon Neutrality Ventures, the venture capital arm of Total SE, and other specialist hydrogen investors made an investment in Hyzon.
China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) said earlier this month it will increase investments in hydrogen. “It is our goal to become the No.1 hydrogen enterprise in China, to achieve a systematic layout of the entire hydrogen energy industry chain that will make hydrogen refueling as convenient as gas refueling,” said Zhang Yuzhuo, chairman of Sinopec. The company, which produces 3.5 million tons of hydrogen per year, has already built hydrogen refueling stations in Guangdong, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Guangxi. The company expects the number of stations to reach 1,000 by 2025
The Brazilian state of Ceará plans to become a global producer and supplier of green hydrogen, triggering new investments in renewable energy generation. “This is a great opportunity for the country to become a global player as a producer and exporter of green hydrogen, based on our onshore wind and solar photovoltaic power generation potential. Much of this potential is concentrated in the Northeast of the State, which also offers the best logistical conditions for the European and American markets,” commented earlier this week Adão Linhares, executive secretary of Ceará’s Secretariat of Infrastructure (Seinfra).
French maritime construction company Fountaine-Pajot has chosen the hydrogen technology offered by French-based EODev. For now, the collaboration is focused on a 59-foot sailing catamaran. According to the companies, the new yacht is not as noisy as similar diesel-powered models. “In addition to a significant weight, and therefore energy consumption, saving, the advantage of the hydrogen-electric combination in comparison with a 100% electric system, is to allow the management of the energy needs depending on the use, thanks to the continuous power of the fuel cell, while being able to instantly use the batteries for occasional peak power requirements. The hydrogen powering this system is compressed and stored at 350 bar, the standard pressure used by hundreds of buses around the world,” reads the note released on Tuesday. Earlier this month, Toyota announced it became a director shareholder of EODev.
The majority of the jobs in the hydrogen industry doesn’t require a deep knowledge of hydrogen, said Philippe Boucly, president of France Hydrogène, presenting a white paper on the skills required in the industry. France Hydrogène commissioned Grenoble-based Infinergia with the study. According to the report, 27 of the 84 identified jobs require a real knowledge of hydrogen, 41 require basic knowledge, while 16 jobs do not require specific knowledge.

Under the procurement exercise, HEPURA will award feed-in premium payments – on top of wholesale electricity returns – during 15-year contracts to two types of project: Facilities with a generation capacity of 300 kW-1 MW and 1-20 MW installations.
For the first project category, the authority wants to contract around 50 GWh and has allocated a total budget of HUF 200 million (around $670,000) per year. For the second category, an annual budget of HUF 250 million has been allocated and the contracted power should be 250 GWh.
Bids will have to be submitted between July 1 and July 30. The auction is part of the METAR-KÁT renewables incentive program introduced by the Hungarian government in 2017.
In the second auction, which was finalized in February, the lowest bid came in at HUF16.18/kWh ($0.0543). For installations between 300 kW and 1 MW, final prices varied from HUF21/kWh ($0.071) to HUF 23.03/kWh, while in the group including projects ranging in size from 1 MW to 49.9 MW, final prices ranged from HUF16.18/kWh ($0.0549) to HUF17.97/kWh. The average final price in the first category was HUF22.35 while, in the second one, it was HUF17.22.
In the first pilot auction held in March 2020, the HEPURA awarded almost all the 131.9 MW capacity to solar projects. The final average price was HUF24.81/kWh in the first category and HUF21.69/kWh in the second. The lowest bid of HUF20.20/kWh was submitted for a 20 MW solar plant.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Hungary had installed 1.95 GW of solar by the end of 2021. New capacity additions hit 553 MW last year.

Perovskites, a much newer area of research in PV, have quickly achieved efficiencies rivaling those of silicon, and tandem cells featuring both technologies have demonstrated potential for efficiencies nearing the 30% mark. But perovskites are affected by degradation mechanisms and performance-limiting defects less well understood than some of those in silicon, which continue to limit their commercial.
New research from scientists led by the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSD) outlines a key role for hydrogen in the formation of defects in perovskite films – particularly in methylammonium lead iodide, the material which has so far set most of the efficiency records for perovskite solar cell performance.
“We found that it is surprisingly easy to break one of the bonds and remove a hydrogen atom on the methylammonium molecule,” explained UCSD researcher Xie Zhang. “The resulting ‘hydrogen vacancy' then acts as a sink for the electric charges that move through the crystal after being generated by light falling on the solar cell. When these charges get caught at the vacancy, they can no longer do useful work, such as charging a battery or powering a motor, hence the loss in efficiency.”
The conclusions about hydrogen vacancies are drawn from computational analysis, described in full in the paper Minimizing hydrogen vacancies to enable highly efficient hybrid perovskites, published in Nature Materials.
The researchers note that replacing methylammonium with another organic molecule, formamidinium – which has also been widely studied as a perovskite solar cell material, would be beneficial, as the hydrogen defects are less prevalent in this material.
“Through trial and error, it has been found that perovskites in which the methylammonium molecule is replaced by formamidinium exhibit better performance. We are now able to attribute this improvement to the fact that hydrogen defects form less readily in the formamidinium compound,” explained UCSB materials professor Chris Van de Walle. “Based on these fundamental insights, the scientists who fabricate the materials can develop strategies to suppress the harmful defects, boosting additional efficiency enhancements in solar cells.”

The first plant built with this technology is being deployed on inshore waters in the Waal (Rhine), the widest river of the Netherlands, near IJzendoorn, a village in the province of Gelderland.
According to the company, the 65 kW floating array will be connected to a 10 kW electrolyzer that produces hydrogen. The pilot project is being developed with Dutch hydrogen company Voyex, which specializes in the production of hydrogen bonded with a liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC), an oil-like liquid that serves as a binding agent.

“Soon we can start measuring the performance of the panels and the performance of the platform,” SolarDuck CTO Don Hoogendoorn told pv magazine. “Later this year it will be connected to the VOYEX demonstrator.”
According to him, in the pilot, the four triangular structures were flexibly connected somewhat like a jigsaw puzzle, then towed upstream to the project location. “Based on the gained knowledge during the past months and the data coming from the demonstrator, we will start working on our second pilot project which will be put offshore in early 2022,” Hoogendoorn furher explained. “For that design, we focus on offshore performance validation and industrialization of the process.”

“We are targeting megacities and large companies in the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, South East Asia, and in general markets with high solar radiation in the global Sun Belt,” Burgers said in early March, in an interview with pv magazine.
The company's basic floating structures are triangular in shape, measuring 16 x 16 x 16 meters, and can be flexibly connected together to form large megawatt-sized plants. These platforms allow the placement of PV modules more than three meters above the water surface. This particular configuration, according to the company, enables the use of conventional PV modules with high efficiencies without the need for specifically designed and more expensive products.

Chinese manufacturer Astronergy supplied the modules for the demonstrator project and Dutch materials specialist DSM provided its high-performance polyolefin Endurance backsheets, which have been fitted to the modules. The system was assembled at the facility of Dutch shipbuilding and engineering conglomerate Damen Shipyards, with Norsk Hydro Extrusion providing the aluminum extrusions.

Germany’s Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has reported that 548.6 MW of new PV systems were registered in March, marking a strong increase from February, when new additions totaled 350 MW, and from March 2020, when newly installed PV capacity also reached around 350 MW.
The newly installed PV capacity for the first quarter of 2021 is 1,325 MW, which compares to 1.27 GW in the same period a year earlier.
The cumulative capacity of all subsidized PV systems in Germany reached 54.9 GW at the end of March.
Most of the new capacity in March – 440.6 MW – comes from rooftop PV systems not exceeding 750 kW in size under the country's FIT scheme. Furthermore, the Federal Network Agency registered the grid connection of 108 MW of projects selected through tenders that have been awarded feed-in premium payments. The remaining capacity is represented by PV installations built under the nation’s tenant electricity scheme.
The Federal Network Agency also published new compensation rates beginning in May. The monthly decrease of solar subsidies remains at 1.4 percent, while fixed feed-in tariffs for rooftop systems will range between €0.0769/kWh and €0.0586/kWh, depending on size.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) released a tool that it said will increase supply chain transparency and help ensure that solar components are “made ethically throughout the solar value chain.”
The Solar Supply Chain Traceability Protocol is a set of guidelines intended to help solar companies meet compliance obligations and “provide customers with assurances that their solar products are free of unethical labor practices.” (Read the protocol here.)
“Solar customers expect their products to be ethically produced, and this protocol helps ensure that solar products coming into the United States are not made using forced labor,” said John Smirnow, SEIA’s vice president of market strategy.
In early February, some 175 solar companies, including some of the top solar manufacturers in the world, signed an SEIA-led pledge opposing forced labor in the solar supply chain. In an interview with pv magazine, SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said that the industry trade group became aware of the forced labor issue late in 2020 and had been communicating with our companies that “they need to move their supply chains.” She set a goal of late June for companies to have adjusted their supply chains to avoid conflict regions.
The SEIA supply chain traceability document said it is intended to have “universal application” across product lines intended for export to the U.S. market. It expected key adopters to include equipment manufacturers and U.S. importers. It said that while its aim is to focus on “the provenance of material inputs,” it also recognizes the importance of independent, third-party audits and a “strong corporate social responsibility and import compliance platform.”
SEIA said that the U.S. government has “identified forced labor as an area of concern for the solar supply chain.” It said that U.S. solar customers also are “increasingly seeking assurances that the products they purchase are truly sustainable and, in particular, free of forced labor.”
SEIA said that that the new tool “by itself will not stamp out forced labor, companies need to go through the steps laid out by the protocol.”
In a statement released by SEIA, George Hershman, president of Swinerton Renewable Energy and SEIA board chair said, “This important tool provides a consistent set of guidelines rooted in equity, security and sustainability to thousands of solar companies across the country.”
The protocol is a set of recommended best practices that SEIA said is designed to prevent forced labor in the solar supply chain; help companies meet their U.S. import compliance obligations; and provide customers value chain transparency. SEIA said the tool has been structured as an industry specification or de facto standard, with the expectation that it will be further developed into a formal industry standard.
pv magazine’s UP Initiative is looking at what solar and energy storage companies can do to lead by positive example when it comes to the workers, often far removed, involved in the production of their products and services. Topics include: Impacts on global polysilicon supply for solar manufacturers; supply chain audits and transparency in PV; and relevant policy directives in the United States and Europe. Keep up-to-date on our coverage as we go through Q2 2021.
The protocol includes an audit mechanism intended to measure a company’s implementation and compliance. SEIA said that in assessing conformance, “no single factor will be dispositive.” It said that auditors would assess conformance based on a “holistic approach.”
SEIA also updated its Solar Commitment, which defines common labor, health and safety, environmental, and ethical standards and expectations for solar companies. The update includes guidance on workplace safety and ethical labor practices.
In addition, the standard includes recycling and refurbishment best practices, information on energy consumption tracking, procedures to avoid the use of conflict minerals in solar products, and additional guidance that companies can follow to hold suppliers to the standards.
SEIA also released a Solar Buyers’ Guide on Traceability, which summarizes the protocol and offers a set of questions that customers, developers, financiers, and other stakeholders should ask suppliers about products in the solar + storage value chain.

In the paper Herbage Yield, Lamb Growth and Foraging Behavior in Agrivoltaic Production System, published in Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, the US group explained that the grazing experiment was conducted at a 1.4 MW agrivoltaic facility located on the university's premises in spring 2019 and 2020. The PV system is east-west oriented and the panels are placed at a height of 1.1 MW from the ground, with a 6 m distance between the panel rows.
The plant area was divided into three 0.2-hectare blocks and each block was randomly assigned to the grazing under solar panels and grazing in open pasture fields. “In solar pastures, the distance between solar panels was 6 m, providing 3 m fully shaded and 3 m partially shaded areas,” the researchers explained. “Each solar pasture contained four solar arrays and four solar panels. Thus, these pastures had 50% open (partially shaded) and 50% fully shaded areas.”
The foraging behavior of the lambs was monitored by visual scanning at five-minute intervals from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and herbage mass was measured in each plot. The researchers also took measurements on land-use efficiency for total annual herbage and lamb liveweight production. “To calculate the net returns from the onsite grazing activity, we averaged the daily liveweight production in 2019 and 2020, multiplied by the average number of grazing days across both years, and assumed an average price of $316.19 per hundred kg weight based on the USDA average price of lambs in 2018,” the scientists stated.
The experiment showed that the annual forage yield in solar pastures was lower compared to open pastures, which the scientists attributed to poor production in fully shaded areas. They also ascertained, however, that solar pastures showed higher forage nutritive value, which offset the lower herbage mass, leading to similar lamb liveweight gains in both the solar and open pasture fields. Their measurements also demonstrated that 45% of the lambs' grazing activity took place in shade directly under the solar panels. This percentage rose to 96% for its ruminating and idling activities.
Furthermore, the research team found that the lambs' daily water consumption was similar for both solar and open pasture filed during early spring, and that lambs in open pastures drank more water than those under the PV system in the late spring period. “There was no difference observed in water intake of the lambs in spring 2020,” it emphasized, adding that the shade created by solar panels can be more beneficial to animal welfare and water consumption in hot and arid regions. “Furthermore, agrivoltaics systems may alleviate the need of artificial shelter provision to livestock, also reducing the initial infrastructure cost in pasture-based livestock production.”
Through this analysis, the scientists came to the conclusion that the return from grazing was $1,046 per hectare per year in open pastures and $1,029 per hectare per year in pastures with solar panels. “The overall return is about the same, and that doesn't take into account the energy the solar panels are producing,” said research co-author Serkan Ates.
According to another study published by the same research group in January, using land for both solar photovoltaic power and agriculture could provide 20% of total electricity generation in the United States.

“Vertical bifacial agrivoltaics were chosen in this project because we believe it is one of the agrivoltaic configurations that is easy to integrate and scale up in farmland; it is a cost-effective mounting structure, and provides easy access for types of machinery used in farmland,” researcher Pietro Elia Campana told pv magazine. “Moreover, it is difficult today to get permission to build solar parks on agricultural land in Sweden, and our hope is that agrivoltaics will open a completely new market,” said researcher Bengt Stridh.
The scientist developed a techno-economic optimization model that is claimed to be able to outline the ideal design parameters for an agrivoltaic vertical PV system by combining climatological data with figures on expected solar power generation, shading distribution, water for irrigation, and agricultural yield. The proposed model takes into account, in particular, how much photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), which is the portion of the light spectrum utilized by plants for photosynthesis, is received on the crop.
The model is based on OptiCE, which is an open-source modeling and optimization package for clean energy technologies. The package contains algorithms for calculating the solar position, decomposing solar radiation, analyzing shadings, calculating evapotranspiration, modeling crop growth, and optimizing the system design considering techno-economic aspects. The optimal system design is attained, the researchers claim, through a bio-inspired optimization algorithm that performs hourly dynamic simulations of the entire water-food-energy interrelationships in agrivoltaic systems.
One of the key parameters that the model seeks to determine is the optimal distance between the solar module rows depending on the kind of crop. For example, the research group found that 9 m could be an ideal distance when oats are cultivated and 8.5 m is the most suitable distance for potatoes at the selected location in Sweden, which means crop planting should be thoroughly planned through multi-year and multi-crop simulations when crop rotation must be implemented.
A further simulation has been performed for pasture grass, the kind of crop grown underneath the first agrivoltaic system in Sweden, and the optimal distance was 9 m. “We are waiting for the results generated by the demonstration site to validate and calibrate the model,” Campana explained.
The row distance, according to the researchers' findings, has an impact on PAR distribution and — at the latitude of the investigated location and as a consequence — crop yield may be more than halved when the row distance is reduced from 20 to 5 m. The potential PV production can be reduced by about 20% when the row distance is similarly reduced from 20 to 5 m.
The optimal distance is a result of a techno-economic mathematical problem to find the trade-off for maximizing the land equivalent ratio, which means maximizing crop yield and electricity production per area. Nevertheless, the optimal distance also depends on the width of the tractors and types of machinery that are typically used by the farmers, which means the row distance has to match the width of the agricultural equipment and practices. Distances close to or higher than 20 m produce a negligible effect on the crop yield. This, however, has three disadvantages, according to the research group. The first is that the land equivalent ratio is lower and the second is related to the infrastructural costs of the PV system that become higher. “And last but not least, we want to make agriculture more resilient to temperature stresses and drought by exploiting the shadings on the crops and this effect does not occur at high row distances,” Stridh specified.
The model is being tested on a simulated 22.8 kW vertical installation located in Sweden and relying on 380 W n-type bifacial modules provided by Chinese manufacturer Jolywood with a bifaciality of around 80%. Bifaciality is commonly defined as the ratio of the output measured from the rear side of a module over the output measured from its front side.
With their calculations, the scientists also concluded that orienting the azimuth angle towards east and west, rather than south, may help minimize power fluctuations. “This avoids having a high peak of power production at noon by instead having lower peaks in the morning and in the afternoon,” Campana affirmed. “It also reduces the peak power injected into the grid and matches better the electricity consumption of the farm, thus leading to a higher PV self-consumption.”
The research project is being financed by Swedish energy agency Energimyndigheten, with the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Solkompaniet AB, and Kärrbo Prästgård AB as project partners. The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, Uppsala University, Universitá Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Italy, and the US' NASA ARC are participating as scientific collaborators.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/30/indian-government-outlines-rules-for-production-linked-incentive-scheme/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 30, 2021",Indian government outlines rules for production-linked incentive scheme,"From pv magazine India
India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) said this week that it has developed new guidelines for its production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, which aims to achieve gigawatt-scale production of high-efficiency solar modules.
The scheme, which provides funding over a five-year period, has been approved by the president of India. The MNRE will implement it through the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA).
IREDA will have the right to inspect the manufacturing units and offices of applicants and will be able to call upon the National Institute of Solar Energy for help in determining the efficiency and temperature coefficients of modules manufactured by applicants for the incentive. If required, the MNRE will also be able to designate National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories-accredited labs for measurements. 
Selection criteria
Beneficiaries of the PLI scheme will be selected through a bidding process after applicants are shortlisted, based on parameters such as their proposed manufacturing capacity and module performance. Shortlisted applicants will lodge bids based on the level of PLI funding they will require for five years after their planned factories are commissioned.
Preference will be given to fully integrated manufacturing plans, whether based on silicon, thin-film or other technologies. The production of cells, as well as modules, is the minimum scale of integration required to be shortlisted, and a minimum annual production capacity of 1 GW for each step of the supply chain will also be necessary.
The modules must offer minimum efficiency ratings of 19.5%, with a Pmax temperature coefficient greater than -0.3% per degree Celsius, or a minimum module efficiency of 20% with a Pmax temperature coefficient equal to, or better than, -0.4% per degree Celsius.
Capacity allocations
Successful applicants to the PLI scheme will receive a maximum incentive tied to 2 GW of annual production capacity, or half of the planned output of their facility – whichever is lower. That cap ensures that at least three solar manufacturers can benefit from the funds.
PLI cash will be paid out based on the actual production and sales of modules. If a manufacturer sells more products than the production line capacity they bid for, the state funding will be limited to the latter figure. If a successful applicant falls short of the integration level or manufacturing capacity they applied for, no incentives will be paid until the shortfall is addressed.
The incentive will be tapered down over the course of the five-year disbursement period. The first year will pay out the equivalent of 1.4 times an annual reference amount, while the second year will offer 1.2 times the base amount. The third year will be the standard baseline figure, while the fourth and fifth years will be a fraction of that amount.

Located in the Mymensingh district, 100 km north of Dhaka, the solar plant secured last year a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Bangladesh Power Development Board. It was built with an investment of around $90 million and will supply power at an unspecified price to the national utility, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh.
“To develop a project of this scale, we have to work very closely with the stakeholders which include the local communities and authorities especially to address the environmental and social issues that arised during the development and construction period,” said the company's CEO, Tham Chee Aun, without providing further technical or financial details on the project.
With the grid-connection of the facility, the country's installed PV capacity has exceeded 370 MW. Bangladesh's annual existing solar radiation is more than 1900 kWh/m2, whereas average daily solar radiation varies within the range of 4-6.5 kWh/m2.
A good number of solar power plants are making installation progress, while rooftop solar is also seeing continued popularity.

Fortescue Metals Group (FMG), which has signed green energy deals from Papua New Guinea to Jordan over the past year, has contracted Pacific Energy subsidiary Contract Power Australia (CPA) to build Western Australia’s largest network-integrated battery energy storage system (BESS). 
The 42 MW battery project will see CPA design, construct, test, install and commission two batteries for FMG subsidiary Pilbara Energy as part of FMG’s integrated power network in the Australian state's Pilbara region. 
Much of the workload will be forked off to Pacific Energy subsidiary Hybrid Systems Australia, whose executive director, Michael Hall, said the long-standing remote generation experience of Contract Power – combined with Hybrid Systems’ industry leading BESS deployment and network integration expertise – demonstrated the industry capabilities that exist within Western Australia and Australia to deliver world class projects. 
The move is part of FMG’s emissions reduction goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. To do this, FMG’s energy strategy includes strong investments in renewables and low-emission energy sources, including almost AUD 700 million ($544.5 million) in the next stage of its Pilbara Energy Connect program to combine 150 MW of gas-fired generation with 150 MW of solar PV and the aforementioned grid-scale battery. 
The hybrid generation project will provide low-cost power to the Iron Bridge magnetite project currently under construction. The battery was previously planned to be 35 MW/11 MWh, but has since risen to 42 MW of storage capacity.

Canada-based Hydrostor is developing 1,000 MW of long-duration energy storage in California across two projects.
Its projects are in southern Kern County and a less specific site in “central California.” The two installations represent a combined investment of more than $1.5 billion. Hydrostor said that development work is underway, including transmission interconnection, engineering and permitting activities. Even though these initial phases have begun, Hydrostor has not yet said when the projects will start construction or be completed.
All projects will use the company’s Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) technology, which provides eight to 12 hours of energy storage.
State regulators in California have identified a need of up to 1,600 MW of long duration energy storage by 2026. Hydrostor also is developing the Rosamond A-CAES Project in California, northeast of Los Angeles. That project will provide 500 MW of on-demand peaking capacity for 12 hours of duration once it becomes operational in 2024.
