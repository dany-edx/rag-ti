Most of the plants will be connected in the northern and southern periphery of the country.
“We are turning Israel into a renewable energy empire,” said Minister Israel Katz. “We will make clean energy, store it, and sell it to other countries. We are creating operations for now and the day after the war with Hamas.”
The regulator will permit the connection of 2,300 MW to 2,500 MW of renewable energy to the grid during the daytime and 1,000 MW during the night, with 1,000 MW to 1,200 MW to be directed to the low-voltage network.
In September, the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure said that it would enable the connection of 2,000 MW of renewable energy, as it recalculated national grid capacity. It said that grid congestion was the main reason for halting the connection of new renewable plants.
The Israeli government has allocated ILS 17 billion ($4.4 billion) to address grid congestion in the country. Noga is leading the project, which aims to enable the integration of additional renewable production plans and storage facilities into the grid by 2030.
The country mainly has PV at its disposal to increase its generation capacity, with around 5 GW already installed. The renewables target is 20% of generation by 2025 and 30% by 2030.

It provides data from 12 European countries.
“More detailed data is, of course, available. For example, the contribution of the individual renewable sources to the load currently and as a forecast can be shown,” the institute said in a press release. “In addition, the day-ahead price on the electricity exchange for any of the 34 European countries listed can also be used as the basis for the electricity traffic light.”
Fraunhofer ISE said the app is only available for Android. It said that an Apple iOS version is now under development. The app is available in German, English, French, Spanish, and Italian.
It uses a traffic light system to indicate the relationship between the current renewable share and the average for the respective month over the past five years. If the current share is 10% below this average, the traffic light is red; if it is 10% above, it is green. For the values in between, the light is yellow.
“New electricity data is available every fifteen minutes,” the institute said. “The data are usually updated hourly to show the current forecast. Next-day forecasts are generally available on the previous evening.”
The institute made current energy data available to all interested parties via an open interface. Consumers can use the traffic light system with smart home devices, enabling some products to only work when the renewable share reaches green levels.
“Other energy flow processes in the energy system, such as electric vehicle charging at a charging station or power-consuming events like big-data processing, can also be controlled in this way,” said Fraunhofer ISE.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/14/ppas-offer-protection/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY,GREECE,ITALY,POLAND,ROMANIA,SPAIN",,"DECEMBER 14, 2023",PPAs offer protection,"From pv magazine 12/23-01/24
For corporations with sustainability targets, PPAs are an optimal tool to accelerate the transition to clean sources of electricity while ensuring cost stability. Long-term contracts featuring fixed or predictable prices offer a practical solution for raising corporate sustainability and mitigating price volatility.
Countries with favorable solar conditions, such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Poland, have seen substantial growth in PV power projects and solar PPAs. Other EU member states are also increasingly recognizing the potential of investing in solar energy.
For example, the Spanish market is experiencing a solar PPA resurgence due to competitive prices and abundant sunshine. IB Vogt has seen large-scale solar attracting significant attention from corporations and utilities. The main driver behind this growth stems from the combination of low PPA prices and the ample scale of projects with strong wind and solar resources, creating a conducive environment for corporate renewables-PPA buyers.
One of the most compelling projects IB Vogt closed in Spain in 2022 was the 149 MW Garnacha solar power plant located in the province of Zamora. The project signed a 12-year PPA with Google. The successful close of project financing was a notable example of the combined power of different industries, such as renewable energy, global technology, and financial services all working together.
Along with Spain, the German and Italian markets have emerged as strongly competitive in terms of solar PPAs. Power purchase agreements are the third pillar of PV growth in Germany alongside invitations to tender, and self-consumption, according to the the current “EU Market Outlook” published by trade body SolarPower Europe. Italy has witnessed a resurgence in its solar industry with the revised National Integrated Plan for Climate and Energy for 2030 envisaging a leading role for solar in the nation’s energy mix and PV expected to represent more than half of Italy’s renewables capacity.
While the surge in these markets may not be surprising, given their relative maturity, central and Eastern Europe has also seen rising PPA potential. Emerging markets such as Poland, Romania, and Greece have recently increased their renewables targets, removing red tape for PPAs and becoming more attractive for corporate electricity purchasers.
Despite the surge in interest for corporate PPAs, the market for large-scale solar investments is in its early stages.
Intense competition for access to renewable energy projects has led to innovative deal structures and a wide range of contract terms. Fixed prices offer budgetary certainty and risk mitigation, ensuring stability but potentially missing out on market savings. Minimum price guarantees offer downside protection but may come with a cost premium.
Physical settlements offer direct energy supply and hedge against physical risk but can be logistically complex while financial settlements provide risk management and increased flexibility but expose buyers to financial market and basis risk – the financial risk that offsetting investments in a hedging strategy will not experience price changes in entirely opposite directions from each other.
Decisions should align with risk tolerance, budget considerations, and strategic goals, weighing the pros and cons of each pricing element to determine the most suitable approach.
The future for solar PPAs in Europe appears bright. These agreements play a pivotal role in achieving EU targets for renewable energy adoption and reducing carbon emissions. As more corporations commit to sustainability goals and countries implement supportive policy, the market is poised for substantial growth.
A diverse array of players participate in these agreements. Project developers, large corporations, utilities, and financial institutions are key stakeholders and all of these players are contributing to the flourishing PPA ecosystem. Integrating capabilities is therefore essential to delivering end-to-end solutions for the execution of PPA deals.
IB Vogt’s commitment is to contribute to the growth and transformation of energy landscapes across the region with a pipeline of more than 45 GW of generation capacity of projects under development, of which around 28 GW are located in Europe.

They have found that the profitability of such facilities could be increased by up to 2%.
The scientists ran cost-optimal assessments for systems with and without batteries, and then compared their profitability in light of capacity markets, ancillary services, and energy arbitrage.
“This paper investigates the profitability potential for a viable business case for battery storage integration with utility-scale hybrid hydropower-solar photovoltaic plants,” they said. “It is based on a hypothetical, two-reservoir cascaded hydropower plant in Sub-Saharan Africa.”
The research team maintained constant characteristics for hydropower plants in the simulation, with a 36 MW turbine and a 90 MW turbine. The hybrid power plant operated under a power purchase agreement (PPA), with fixed capacities for both hydropower and the power grid restricted to 126 MW.
“In this study, a two-level configuration is assumed to represent a scenario in which electricity is more valuable during daytime,” the researchers said. “The same two-level shape persists throughout the entire year.”
The optimization model adjusted the capacity of the floating PV and the battery. The south-oriented floating PV system, with a fixed 13-degree tilt, used crystalline silicon PV modules with 19.9% efficiency and total system losses of 13%. The Li-ion LFP battery incorporated irradiation levels from the PVGIS SARAH2 dataset, a web application providing solar radiation and PV system energy production data.
The scientists said that for the base case result, the cost-optimal PPA power levels were 12.7 MW at $60/MWh and 118.6 MW at $100/MWh.
“The co-optimized case, in which both battery and [floating PV] are optimized for cost-efficiency, increases profitability by 0.6% compared to the base case,” they said.
With ancillary service revenue, the base case annual profitability could reach 2%, factoring in battery degradation constraints. The model assumed a 15-year battery lifetime, preventing it from reaching a state of health below 80% after this period, considering additional cycles from ancillary services.
The academics said that energy arbitrage “provided economic benefits for the hydro-floating PV power plant, but batteries were not necessary, and variable spot prices make predictability and value stacking difficult.”
The academics presented their findings in “Profitability of battery storage in hybrid hydropower–solar photovoltaic plants,” which was recently published in the Journal of Energy Storage.

The report collects best practices and expertise from years of experience with the development of floating PV plants.
The association said that in 2022, the cumulative installed capacity of floating PV installations hit 5.7 GW. China alone represents 70% of total capacity, followed by Japan, South Korea, and Europe.
The report claims a global floating solar potential of 3 TW to 7 TW, with IEA-PVPS analysts estimating a more conservative cumulative capacity of 60 GW by 2030. Best practices involve the dual use of water surfaces to deploy floating PV systems.
SolarPower Europe calls for better public support and more European research and innovation funding. It said it will be crucial to manage climatic hazards and wave height for effective development.
“The growth of solar energy is unprecedented and we are striving to achieve the European target of at least 750 GW by 2030,” said Lina Dubina, a policy adviser for SolarPower Europe. “With these guidelines, we show how floating photovoltaics can sustainably contribute to this growth, promote high-quality projects and bring solar energy to new shores.”

Western Australia’s Regional Joint Development Assessment Panel has given planning approval for a 500 MW solar farm that Perth-based Woodside Energy wants to build near Karratha, in the northwestern part of the state.
The AUD 300 million ($196 million) project involves an initial 100 MW PV facility that could be expanded in stages up to 500 MW. Woodside has also outlined plans to include up to 2,000 MWh of battery energy storage – although this development approval is limited to the solar farm component only.
The company said the Woodside Power Project will see a solar facility and big battery built on a 975-hectare site in the Maitland Strategic Industrial Area, approximately 15 kilometers southwest of Karratha.
Woodside said the project will supply renewable energy for use by industrial customers on the Burrup Peninsula, including its own Pluto liquid natural gas (LNG) export facility.
All transmission of power from the solar facility would be delivered via the North West Interconnected System (NWIS), through existing or new infrastructure owned by regional utility Horizon Power.
Woodside Chief Executive Officer Meg O’Neill has previously said the company is looking to capitalise on the region’s “world-class renewable energy resources” and the willingness of industry, government and other key stakeholders to co-operate on new energy opportunities.
“Woodside’s vision is for large-scale supply of renewable energy to existing and future industry on the Burrup Peninsula,” she said. “We are lucky to have access to abundant natural resources, safe and reliable energy operations and both industry and government that are motivated to drive sustainable energy outcomes.”
The planning approval for the solar farm comes just days after Woodside joined other global players in signing the oil and gas decarbonisation charter at the COP28 summit being held in the United Arab Emirates.
The charter, aimed at accelerating methane emissions reduction, includes major industry players like BP, Shell, TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil, among its 50 signatories.
Under the charter, signatories have agreed to end routine flaring and “near-zero upstream methane emissions” by 2030.
O’Neill said the charter reinforces Woodside’s existing commitments to reducing carbon and methane emissions and to investing in the products and services customers need as they do the same.
“The signatories have also agreed to work towards industry best practices and key actions in a number of areas,” she said. “[These include] emissions reduction, investing in renewables and low-carbon fuels, and improved transparency through enhanced measurement, reporting and verification of greenhouse gas emissions.”
Woodside has committed to reducing its carbon emission by 30% by 2030 and plans to achieve net zero by 2050 or sooner and has previously outlined plans to target investments of more than AUD 7 billion in emerging new energy this decade.
That however compares with its planned spend on large-scale oil and gas projects, including its Scarborough gas field project off the coast of Western Australia.
With a price tag of AUD 16.5 billion, the project will involve the construction of a 430-kilometre pipeline, linking the Scarborough gas field to the mainland, as well as a second production train at the Pluto LNG processing plant.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/14/solar-lcoe-may-decrease-by-up-to-20-in-europe-by-2030/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",,"DECEMBER 14, 2023",Solar LCOE may decrease by up to 20% in Europe by 2030,"The cost of solar photovoltaic systems has decreased dramatically over the past decade. Market prices of PV modules have decreased by about 95% in real terms from 2011. PV has reached parity with retail and wholesale electricity in most countries.
To further analyze the PV market and prices, the European Technology and Innovation Platform for Photovoltaics (ETIP-PV) has recently published its levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) calculations for the period between 2023 and 2050. The LCOE of PV-generated electricity was analyzed for five locations in Europe (Helsinki, Munich, Toulouse, Rome, and Malaga) and four PV system types (residential 5 kW, commercial 50 kW, industrial 1 MW, and utility-scale 100 MW).
The PV LCOE is dependent on the generation cost and includes all the costs involved in supplying PV power at the point of connection to the grid. It is also dependent on the PV system capital (CAPEX) and operational (OPEX) expenditures. The OPEX includes the costs and profit margins of the whole value chain including financing, project development, manufacturing, installation, operation, and maintenance.
For decades, module prices have very closely followed the so-called learning curve, which means that each time the global cumulative PV generation capacity doubles, the price of modules decreases by about 25%. The module prices are expected to decrease according to this historical learning rate (LR) during the next decades, mainly because of better manufacturing processes, more economical use of materials, and continuous improvement in module efficiencies. In addition to an LR of 25%, the calculations also considered an annual inflation of 2%, a system lifetime of 30 years for rooftop systems or 35 years for ground-mounted installations, and an annual degradation of 0.5% in all cases.
Main Findings
According to the base scenario by the ETIP PV, the cumulative global PV capacity would increase from 1.5 TW at the end of 2032 to about 5.5 TW by 2030, and to 30 TW by 2050.
The OPEX for utility-scale is expected to decrease from €12.5 ($13.6)/W/year at the end of 2023 to €9/kW/year in 2050, while for rooftop solar it is €10/kW/year. The CAPEX for utility-scale should fall from €0.46/W at the end of this year to €0.23/W in 2050, while for residential (5 kW), commercial (50 kW), and industrial (1 MW) the prices may reach €0.81, €0.48, and €0.33, respectively. Across all sectors, the CAPEX is roughly halved between January 2024 and 2050.
Compared to current values, the PV LCOE is predicted to decrease by about 20% by 2030, and by 50% by 2050. When comparing with the average wholesale electricity prices of 2019-2021, utility-scale PV would already be competitive with a nominal Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) rate well over 10% in all countries. During the 2022 energy crisis in Europe, spot-market prices were much higher making PV even more competitive.
Image: European Technology and Innovation Platform for Photovoltaics (ETIP PV
The ETIP PV predicts a decline in the LCOE for all locations, with the decline being especially prominent in Rome and Malaga. For instance, in Malaga, the utility-scale PV LCOE, with a 7% nominal WACC, is €24/MWh in 2024, but it is expected to decrease to €19/MWh by 2030 and to €13/MWh by 2050. Nevertheless, the LCOE predictions for all locations are very positive, indicating that PV electricity is already cheaper in all five locations with all realistic WACC rates and consumer segments.

Microinverter manufacturer Enphase has officially launched a new 208 V three-phase offering.
The company said that it is also offering a focused support team and design tools for small business solar projects.
It added that system.sized blocks of 200 kW will most efficiently maximize the hardware on a cost-per-watt basis.
Previously, 240V single-phase residential Enphase inverters could be configured into 208V three-phase commercial systems.. However, this required meticulous system design and additional “Q Cables.” The new 208V system offers more flexibility in string design and simplifies installation with a new four-wire 208V Q Cable.
Eric Bergman, Commercial and Industrial Sales Director at Enphase, touted the advantages of the new system to pv magazine USA. Bergman said that installers used to have to “physically land the output of the micros evenly across the three phases of the site.”
Installations also used to require a network protection relay, necessitating an external enclosure. The new IQ8 C&I microinverter comes with the four-wire QD Cable, which integrates phase balancing, V/F ride-through, and loss of phase detection – functions previously managed externally by the Network Protection Relay.
Enphase saie that all hardware and associated equipment will be classified as domestic content, potentially qualifying for the 10% US Inflation Reduction Act tax credit adder. However, the definitive guidance from the Internal Revenue Service is still pending.
US production of the commercial inverter is set to begin in the first quarter of 2024. Enphase is initially focusing on the core functionalities of the 208V equipment, with plans to introduce additional features like grid-tied load support, energy storage integration, and 480V three-phase support in the future.
Bergman noted that a large, skilled workforce is already trained to sell and install these systems.
“Right now, the nation is seeing a bit of a slowdown in residential solar sales. At the same time, commercial solar contractors are having a challenging time finding installation crews,” Bergman said. “The 208 V gear gives both groups multiple opportunities. Residential installers who’ve been installing Enphase their whole careers can be tapped by commercial groups to help them deploy these systems, or sell to small businesses on their own.”

This article was amended to state that previously, 240V (not 120V) single-phase residential Enphase inverters could be configured into 208V three-phase commercial systems.
