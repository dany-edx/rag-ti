Many of the best performing devices to date have utilized an n-type, or n-i-p, cell architecture for the perovskite layer.
When it comes to fabricating tandem devices that combine perovskites with a silicon bottom cell, however, the n-i-p architecture comes up against major challenges and many researchers have instead chosen to focus on the p-i-n architecture, with the unfortunate side effect of cutting tandem devices out from some of the most promising research in perovskites.
Scientists led by Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), however, were able to overcome several of these challenges. They demonstrated a tandem cell based on an n-i-p perovskite stacked on top of a silicon heterojunction cell that achieved 27% efficiency. This represents a big jump from the previous record of 22%.
The device is described in the paper Ligand-bridged charge extraction and enhanced quantum efficiency enable efficient n–i–p perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, published in Energy & Environmental Science. The group worked with a layer of a material called amorphous niobium oxide, creating selective contacts that limited the amount of light energy absorbed by the cell but lost as heat.
“Overall, we allowed more light to be captured in the regular structured tandem solar cells, and we converted the absorbed to energy more effectively thanks to our newly developed contacting materials,” explains KAUST researcher Erkan Adin. “With these advancements, we achieved a power conversion efficiency exceeding 27%.”
Having overcome these fundamental challenges, the group soon expects to reach even higher efficiencies with the n-i-p tandem cell technology, also noting that its sees strong potential for use of the cells in solar-driven water splitting for hydrogen production. And the next step for the group will be to scale the devices up to work on ‘full size’ six inch silicon wafers. “At KAUST, we are working to scale up this platform towards the industrial standards of the silicon technology, namely six inches wafers,” Stefaan de Wolf, a leader of the research team, said. “We already develop our tandem technologies on double-side textured SHJ cells, which is today’s industry standards.”

Last week, Brazil's energy regulator, Aneel, and the Chamber for the Commercialisation of Electrical Energy (CCEE) held the new-energy auctions A-3/2021 and A-4/2021, the first of their kind organized since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Energy Research Company (EPE), which is controlled by the country's Ministry of Energy and Mines, had registered 1,841 projects totaling 66,862 MW of power.
In total, seven solar projects were among the winners (out of 51 in total). Of these, five (out of a total 33) were awarded in Leilão A-3/2021, and two (out of a total 18) in Leilão A-4/2021.
In the case of Leilão A-3/2021, the projects will be located in Pernambuco and Paraíba, the investment amounts to BRL618.8 million ($118 million) and they have a combined capacity of 169.3 MW.
In Leilão A-4/2021, the two projects will be built in Paraíba with an estimated investment of BRL289.3 million ($55 million) and they add up to 100 MW.
In the opinion of André Patrus, executive director of Aneel's executive secretariat for auctions, the two auctions were a success. “We contract[ed] all the sources offered, contributing to the diversification of the national electricity matrix, with significant discounts and savings of around BRL2.5 billion for consumers, considering the reduction in the price of the energy negotiated in relation to the final prices,” said Patrus.
The signed agreements, which amount to BRL4 billion in future investments in the construction of the plants, will have a duration of 20 and 30 years and will begin to supply energy in January 2024 and January 2025.
In total, 33 companies won the A-3/2021 auction and three hydroelectric projects with a capacity of 35.25 MW were awarded. Regarding wind energy, there were 23 projects, with a capacity of 251.7 MW, and two biomass projects, with a capacity of 91.14 MW.
Regarding A-4/2021, three hydroelectric projects with a capacity of 77.018 MW were awarded; ten wind projects totaling 167.8 MW, and three biomass projects with a capacity of 92.5 MW.

The case concerns whether the fair price of Xinyi solar products shipped to the EU should have been determined by the European Commission with reference to prices of similar goods made in market-economy nations or whether the manufacturer's claim to have proved it operated under market conditions should have been upheld, rendering third-party product reference unnecessary.
Xinyi claimed ‘market economy treatment' (MET) for its products in May 2013, less than three months after the commission started investigating the alleged dumping of solar glass products into the EU from China.
As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we've focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
The commission said, in letters sent to Xinyi in August and September 2013, the manufacturer had failed to prove its market economy status because it had benefited from favorable income tax treatment, and the EU body, in May 2014, rejected all of the MET claims it had received from Chinese companies, including Xinyi, with products made by the latter having a 36.1% anti-dumping duty applied to them.
In August 2014, Xinyi appealed to the European General Court (EGC) and sought annulment of the regulation at issue in the case, with the court upholding the first part of the manufacturer's appeal in March 2016. When the commission appealed that decision, asking the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to set aside the judgement because of errors in law, the ECJ referred the case back to the General Court, which found in Xinyi's favor – and against the commission and Austrian-owned GMB Glasmanufaktur Brandenburg GmbH, in September two years ago.
However, ECJ advocate-general Giovanni Pitruzzella on Thursday advised the European Court of Justice to set aside the decision made by the General Court as to the first plea made by Xinyi in its case, and referred the matter back to the EGC to consider the remaining pleas.
Pitruzzella dismissed Xinyi's argument any “significant distortion” to its business caused by operating in non-market-economy conditions must be proven to relate specifically to the “manufacture and sale of like product,” in this case, solar glass. Instead, the judge agreed with the commission and GMB that such a distortion to Xinyi's broader “financial situation,” would be sufficient to bring into play the need to refer to products made in third-party market economies.
The advocate-general agreed a beneficial tax regime could be considered as distorting costs and prices, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, and agreed with GMB's claim the burden of proof should lie with the manufacturer, rather than the European Commission. Xinyi had argued the tax benefits it received from Beijing had amounted to just 1.14% of its turnover and 1.34% of its total costs, meaning it could not amount to a significant distortion of its business.
This copy was amended on 14/07/21 to reflect an advocate-general advises the court rather than rendering a judgement.

The manufacturer said the clamps have obtained the Conformité Européenne (CE) certification, which is a regulatory standard that verifies certain products are safe for sale and use in the European Economic Area (EEA), and can be used without the need to penetrate the roof on almost all types of seam sheet roofs.

“The TMRD08, TMK1508 and TMK2008 models can be installed on artisanal seam sheet roofs or industrial system seam sheet roofs made of coated steel, aluminum and other materials,” the Austrian company said. “They are also suitable for copper roofs, with the optional stainless steel saddle, because the attachment prevents the aluminum clamps from reacting with the copper and corroding.”
The manufacturer explained the height of the clamps can be adjusted between 30 and 46mm and that the clamp can be clicked into the connection profile of the standing seam clamp or into a rail system when mounted in portrait mode. “Thanks to the new sliding seam clamps, we are completing our product family,” said Aerocompact CTO, Christian Ganahl. “The current standing seam clamp range includes double seam clamps, angle and snap seam clamps, and round seam clamps.”
The new products come with a 25-year warranty and are claimed to withstand wind loads of around 220km per hour and snow loads of over 3 kilonewton/m2.

The result has been confirmed by Germany's TÜV Rheinland and beats the company's previous record of 23.1% set in January 2021.
“The module's breakthrough performance was the result of adopting JinkoSolar's cutting-edge TOPCon cell technology fused with a new-type of welding and packaging technology,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The module design not only reduces the internal resistance loss of the module, but improves power efficiency and module appearance.”
In January 2020, Jinko said it was able to improve the panel performance by applying a new anti-reflection coating and advanced metallization technologies. New Tiling Ribbon (TR) technology was also incorporated into the cell design, which eliminates any inter-cell gap. At the time, the panel power conversion efficiency was 22.39%.
The solar module relies on solar cells featuring a 267.72cm2 monocrystalline silicon substrate grown using the Czochralski method.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/12/interview-gcl-to-focus-on-hydrogen-solar-epc-projects-as-it-leaves-ipp-model-behind/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"JULY 12, 2021","Interview: GCL to focus on system integration solutions, more than a high efficiency module provider","Thomas Kun Zhang, general manager, GCL System Integration: For better financial status and in the interest of the entire group, GCL had to change its heavy asset business model to a much lighter one. We started selling off PV plants in 2018 and, with more than 6 GW of solar PV farms sold by end of this June, we have significantly lowered the liabilities and debts of the entire GCL group, including GCL System Integration. Thus, we now have a much better financial position for future development.
In the future, GCL will focus on hydrogen energy development and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) projects. We will not be an Independent Power Producer (IPP) anymore. This field might be more suitable for state owned enterprises.
In 2020, GCL announced a new PV module base in east Hefei City, Anhui Province, with a total planned module capacity of 60 GW. Last December, construction started on Phase I of this project with a capacity of 15 GW. Currently, we’re on track to finish construction and commission the first 5 GW by the end of Q3; another 5 GW of capacity will be completed in mid-2022. For the supporting solar cell operations, GCL has planned a 10 GW capacity investment in Leshan City, Sichuan Province, with advanced Passivated emitter rear cell (PERC), TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivated contact) and heterojunction (HJT) technologies.
GCL is perhaps the only Chinese PV company that has successfully achieved vertical integration, covering all aspects of downstream and upstream. As mentioned, we have planned for a total of 60 GW of new PV module capacity in Hefei, Anhui; and in Leshan, Sichuan Province, 10 GW of advanced solar cell capacity. Meanwhile, our sister company, the Hong Kong listed GCL-Poly, has invested in advanced Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR) methods for polysilicon production. The Xuzhou base has already started mass production of 10,000 ton/year of granular silicon at the beginning of this year. And in Leshan city, Sichuan province, the first phase of our granular silicon project, with a designed capacity of 100,000 ton/year, is expected to start operation in mid-2022. In Inner Mongolia, another granular silicon project with 300,000 ton/year capacity is also advancing quickly.
We presented lots of PV module products featuring advanced module technologies at this year’s show, including large sized wafers, half cut solar cells, and multi bus bar (MBB), bifacial and perovskite techs. There is one product I want to emphasize, which is our new concept module equipped with a heat pump to absorb heat from the panel’s surface. The heat pump can reduce the surface temperature and improve power generation; meanwhile, absorbed heat can raise water temperature for hot water consumption. Our calculation shows that a 5% power generation increase is possible.
The downstream installation market has suffered a lot from the rises, not only from component costs, including polysilicon, PV glass, aluminum frames and others, but also logistic and labor costs for installation. We understand that the polysilicon cost rises came about from short supply; however, we don’t understand why the wafer costs kept rising at the same rate. The wafer makers should have made concessions for the exchange of development of PV installations.

I think the overseas PV installation market will be affected more than China’s domestic market. With high upstream costs, very high shipping costs – container quotes increased from USD$2,700 in the last year to over $14,000 – and poor Covid-19 controls in many markets like India, I am not optimistic about the overseas market this year. More importantly, many overseas markets will lose signed power purchase agreements (PPA) due to time delays or profitability concerns, which will not happen in China.
Our current strategy is to utilize TOPCon on our production lines and provide our customers with the latest PV module products comprising advanced solar cell technology. We are also developing pilot lines for HJT and are keeping on top of all new technical developments and cost changes, including equipment and N-type silicon costs. Besides TOPCon and HJT, GCL has also made great efforts in the R&D of perovskite cells and FBR silicon. With the help of perovskite cells and lower cost FBR silicon, I think PV module costs will be reduced to lower than RMB1.2 per watt in three to five years, which will make solar PV the most competitive of all energies.
If you look at our financial reports, you will see that the overseas business of GCL System Integration has comprised around 70% of our revenue over the past few years. From this figure, we see a quite successful internationalization of the company. But this year, due to the ongoing pandemic, I think the domestic market will increase. But this won’t stop GCL’s pace of globalization. We have established branches in major countries on six continents and more offices will be set up along with the development of our business.
We have seen that some important PV players like Longi have entered this market and we believe it will be huge. But at present there are not many good BIPV products to fulfill the market's needs. I believe the industry needs to develop and launch more BIPV products to better match the scenarios, including not only roof, but also building walls. More importantly, I think is essential to improve the power system of a building – not only power generation, but also power storage and power management. This might require more thinking and exploring.
For some scenarios, like the residential rooftop market, PV modules are limited in size, weight, and labor cost. For utility scale PV plants, if taking into consideration the major inverter manufacturers like Huawei – its 1500 V product is becoming popular – then bigger modules can become more competitive. In this respect, the 210mm product has the advantage of lower costs. As such, it will beat 182mm module types. At GCL, our new lines are all compatible with 182mm and 210mm modules, so we don’t care much about the debate and just provide our customer the product they want.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/12/next-generation-solar-power-unique-design-and-energy-storage-for-grid-stability/,"SPONSORED,CHINA",,"JULY 12, 2021",Next-generation solar power: unique design and energy storage for grid stability,"Making photovoltaics fit for taking its role as the mainstream source of power – that is the task Huawei gave itself with its new FusionSolar 8.0 solution, with its Gemini architecture.
The system comprises three new components designed to reduce the electrical balance-of-system cost and to fully utilize the advantages of centralized and decentralized plant architectures. First, instead of a traditional string inverter, Huawei offers the Venus 2000-32-U0 smart string controller, which is a DC-DC converter stage with 8 MPPTs. The device is installed near the modules at the tables. Second, the Smart PV Controller, SUN 2000-345KTL-H0, is a DC to AC inverter clustered around the substation or storage battery. Finally, on top, comes the highly anticipated, 2 MWh Luna 2000-1/2-S0, fully pre-fabricated, containerized storage solution.
Instead of using traditional string inverters at each table, this solution uses DC-DC converter stages, the smart string controller, near the modules. “We basically carved out the DC-DC converter from our inverters,” says Hariram Subramanian, CTO of Smart PV in Europe at Huawei. The DC to AC conversion stages are located centrally around the substation and the optional storage container. This type of system architecture allows to reduce the electrical balance-of-system costs significantly, by €0.01 per watt. Moreover, by only performing the DC-to-DC conversion and MPP-tracking at the table, this bipolar DC transmission design enables transmission of energy through DC cables. This lowers overall cabling costs and will also reduce transmission losses. Finally, with such an architecture, it is possible to add storage on the DC side of the project. A feat that improves round-trip efficiency and is thus the favored way of adding storage – but also one that hitherto could not be done in combination with string inverters.
Also, for the battery storage part, Huawei has come up with a range of innovations. For example, the battery container comes with a capacity of 2 MWh. Fitted inside a 20-foot shipping container, lithium-iron-phosphate batteries come pre-installed and connected to their respective power electronics. This competitive LFP battery solution rivals nickel-manganese-cobalt-based systems and the chemistry is known to show a high level of thermal stability.
The storage system features a whole range of power electronics to improve the entire system's cost and availability. In addition, the racks can be controlled individually, offering a modular approach for optimal system utilization. By separately managing the racks rather than the whole packs, Huawei says it can increase the charge and discharge capacity by around 15% compared to a solution that relies on a centralized battery management system. On top of that, it can manage the mismatch between packs much better and determine the state-of-charge at high granularity. And that improves the lifetime of the battery.
In an array of, let’s say, 100 MW, Huawei says there is an advantage of arranging inverters, substations, and storage containers in blocks of 8.8 MW each. “If you were to cluster it around blocks of 100 MW, for example, you would need a lot of low-voltage cabling,” says Subramanian. He continues to explain that even with Huawei's bipolar DC transmission system, it is better to use medium-voltage cabling for long-distance transmission to save on transmission losses and cable costs. So instead of having one substation and all the inverters and storage in one place, Huawei says it is better to have 12 substations and inverters cluster in a field of 100 MW.
Another highlight of the new solution is the ability to supply virtual inertia. Inertia in an electric system is a power system's ability to compensate for sudden voltage drops and subsequent frequency deviations. If the load in a network is not perfectly aligned with the supply, the system's voltage drops, decreasing the frequency. When the rate of change of a frequency deviation becomes too large – less than half a Hertz is enough – the network's security system is triggered, and whole parts of a power grid will be islanded, causing widespread power outages. In a traditional power system, the large rotors inside thermal generators can compensate for the effect to some degree as the large rotor is subject to physical inertia and won't change its rotational speed very suddenly.
When a power system features more than 30% of power electronics interfaced generation methods, there could be a risk of too little inertia being left in the grid to compensate for very sudden load changes. Therefore, in preparation for assuming the position as the mainstream power source, Huawei gave its inverters the ability to supply virtual inertia.
Though real inertia comes instantaneously, it is good enough to supply the voltage, and hence frequency, injection within one second. “Already we see a market for this grid stability application in Ireland, and the United Kingdom, but also in Finland and the Nordics, and in Australia,” says Subramanian. He believes these abilities could become mandatory requirements in other markets in the near future.

The researchers' analysis embraced passive cooling systems based on a heat sink or a heat sink embedded into phase change materials (PCMs), as well as active cooling relying on micro-flat heat pipes, either immersed or not immersed in an immersion fluid.
The passive technologies were assessed under two different configurations: an 11%-efficient polycrystalline solar module with a power output of 15 W, equipped with six aluminum heat sinks on the back panel; and the same panel equipped with heat sinks placed into a highly thermally conductive aluminum container filled with TPM350, which is a phase change material offering a high thermal conductivity and melting at 50 degrees Celsius. In all configurations, the solar panels were tilted at 25 degrees and south-oriented. Measurements took into account output power, the surface temperature of the modules, and power conversion efficiency.
Active cooling was considered in two forms: a system consisting of a row of four heat pipes cooled by flowing water and place onto the back of the panel; and another one consisting of four heat pipes immersed in a box of liquid, as liquid bulk, integrated with the back of the solar panel. “This technology is interesting for cooling purposes because it uses buoyancy flow of liquid and evaporative cooling in the heat pipes, as a means of transferring thermal energy,” the scientists explained, referring to the second system and noting that three different liquids, such as engine oil, ethylene glycol, and regular water, were tested.
The two passive techniques were found not to be performant enough to ensure proper cooling. That technique with the simple heat sinks was able to lower the module operating temperature by 10 degrees Celsius, on average; and that based on the PCM was able to guarantee sufficient cooling only for the first two hours. “When melting was completed, the PCM became ineffective, allowing the panel temperature to rise sharply, becoming greater than that of the uncooled panel due to the thermal resistance of the PCM,” the Saudi group stated, adding that a PCM with a higher melting point should be utilized.
As for the active system, the most effective was that based on four heat pipes immersed in water, which was able to reduce the panel temperature by up to 53%; followed by those immersed in ethylene glycol, which results in a 48% reduction; and those immersed in engine oil, which lowered the module temperature by 25%. The lowest percentage – 21% – was obtained by the row of four heat pipes cooled by flowing water. “Lower panel temperatures and higher open-circuit voltages at the solar panel terminals were found if the panel was actively cooled using heat pipes immersed in regular water,” the academics emphasized. “In this configuration, the voltage increment was 13%, relatively compared to the uncooled panel configuration.”
The findings of the research can be found in the paper Innovative technique for achieving uniform temperatures across solar panels using heat pipes and liquid immersion cooling in the harsh climate in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, published in Alexandria Engineering Journal.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/12/elon-musk-could-lose-billions-in-tesla-solarcity-acquisition-suit/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 12, 2021",Elon Musk could lose billions in Tesla-SolarCity acquisition suit,"From pv magazine USA
Tesla founder Elon Musk will attend a Delaware court this month as he is the sole remaining defendant in an approximately $2.2 billion lawsuit filed by his company's shareholders. If Musk is ruled liable, the judgement would be among the largest ever cast on an individual corporate executive in history. 
The suit alleges that Tesla’s purchase of major solar installer SolarCity was an attempt to bailout Musk’s cousin’s struggling company, of which Musk was the largest investor and chairman. The shareholders’ suit also accuses Tesla’s board of having a lax approach to corporate governance.
In response, Tesla stated, in its 2020 annual report: “We believe that claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims.”
Much of this lawsuit revolves around why SolarCity was purchased to begin with. Peter and Lyndon Rive founded SolarCity in 2006 with encouragement from their cousin, Musk. By the time Tesla purchased the company, Musk owned 22.2% and was chairman of the board. Though it had grown to be the largest U.S. installer in 2016, earning record revenues of $730 million, losses were mounting, with $820 million in net losses that year. The company had accumulated more than $1.5 billion in debt by the year of the purchase of the company by Tesla.  
SolarCity’s business model relied on marketing, and it spent heavily on advertising and door-to-door sales while offering low-priced, no-upfront-cost, long-term leases. Post-purchase of the company by Tesla, the strategy changed, as the new owner began to slash marketing costs, moving sales direct-from-online and in-store. Musk noted, in a 2019 deposition on the shareholder lawsuit, that the door-to-door and other sales channel strategies did not match Tesla’s brand. 
Musk also said in the deposition, that problems with the Tesla Model 3 electric vehicle caused the company to reassign much of its SolarCity workforce to bolster its vehicle production operations. He could not confirm exactly what portion of the workforce was reassigned. 
Tesla’s power division is now mostly focused on home energy storage system the PowerWall. That product accounted for the largest portion of the power division’s $1.99 billion in revenue last year. Meanwhile, solar installations have fallen behind, with 205 MW installed in 2020, much less than the 803 MW SolarCity deployed in 2016.
The development of Tesla’s solar roof program has taken things in a different direction from SolarCity’s model. SolarCity installed panels and equipment from top manufacturers and focused on getting customers signed to long-term leases. Tesla’s solar program now focuses on direct sales and uses proprietary solar tiles in its “solar roof” installations. 
Also included in the purchase of SolarCity was a Buffalo, NY panel manufacturing plant. Tesla aimed for 1 GW-per-year of solar production but its partner, Panasonic, has since walked away from the project. It is now unclear what volume of panels or roof tiles Tesla currently produces at the facility. 
While no investor can argue against the fact Tesla has shown dramatic share value growth, the SolarCity deal has not panned out the way some, including Musk, had predicted. In 2016, Musk called the purchase “pretty transformational,” but now he faces significant potential damages in the July hearing.

[They] pledged $100 billion for developing countries back in 2012-2013. The same pledge was used again in article 9, point 11 of [the] COP 21 Paris agreement, re-emphasizing that developed countries will pay 100 billion to developed countries. There is a 2015 agreement and now, in 2021, not even a single penny has been made.”
Warming to the theme, Pulipaka said his country had registered the world's lowest price for an energy storage facility last year, and added: “India is the only G20 country and the only country among … four countries globally, which is in line to achieve its Paris commitment [of] decreasing its emission by 30%. As a developing country, India is leading by example to developed and developing countries on how to honor their commitments.”
The chief exec of the Indian solar trade group was speaking at an online event held by the Washington DC-based GSC, which is the umbrella organization for the world's national solar bodies. The event, held on Thursday and Friday, was organized with SolarPower Europe and EU investment entity Get.Invest.
Alejandro Labanda, head of regulation and studies at Spanish solar organization Unión Española Fotovoltaica, repeated the oft-heard call to simplify the permitting of solar projects, and called for a presumption of approval in the absence of objections to such plants, something he referred to as ‘positive silence.'
Labanda said that principle should be applied to grid connection access as well as to planning and other permits and also called for full transparency on spare grid capacity and access availability for all players, rather than just for the electric utilities which, in many nations, still own the infrastructure they are bidding for access to alongside independent power producers who lack such network data.
This copy was amended on 12/07/21 after clarification by Subrahmanyam Pulipaka about his comments to the event. The tender he referred to will secure 2 GW of solar manufacturing capacity, rather than 3 GW, as previously stated; and the money pledge he said has not been honored by developed nations is $100 billion, not the $100 million previously stated. The copy was also amended to add in the solar module and cell manufacturing capacities expected in India in the next two years.

A 7 kW PV system connected to a 7 kWh residential battery could provide 80% of the power needed by an electric vehicle with an average driving profile of 14,000 kilometers per year, according to a new report by Germany-based EUPD Research.
The market research firm said this corresponds to 2,500 kWh of electricity consumption over an entire year. It said an EV with a driving profile of 5,000 kilometers per year and electricity demand of 900 kWh could achieve the same percentage with a 6 kW PV array combined with a 6 kWh battery. It has also calculated that a 12 kW system with storage capacity would be needed for a frequent driver with 5,000 kWh of electricity needs.
Even without storage, EV drivers can use a high share of solar power. For example, with a 7 kW system and no battery, 39% of a vehicle's electricity needs could be covered over the course of a year from solar power generation.
EUPD Research also said that a solar+storage solution can considerably reduce charging costs. A 10 kW system paired with storage could provide savings of up to 52% of charging costs, it said. This would correspond to savings of €415 per year.
“Home storage system is indispensable, especially in the winter months, in order to temporarily store self-generated solar power for use in the electric car,” said Martin Ammon, managing director of EUPD Research.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/12/new-floating-structure-for-offshore-pv-from-malta/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,MALTA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 12, 2021","New floating structure for offshore PV, from Malta","Scientists at Malta's Institute for Sustainable Energy have developed floating structures for offshore solar plants that are claimed to be robust enough to withstand central Mediterranean weather and cheap enough to be competitive with ground-mounted solar parks in small islands or large coastal cities.
“We turned to offshore PV out of necessity,” professor Luciano Mule'Stagno, told pv magazine. “Here in Malta, we already have over 180 MW of installed PV capacity and there are not too many surfaces available for ground-mounted PV projects and onshore floating PV is not an option, as there are no water reservoirs or suitable lakes.”
Research on offshore PV began in 2013 and the first prototype of the floating structure, called Solaqua 1, was developed in 2014. “But it went through so many changes ever since, as we needed to adapt it to the performed modeling and cost analysis,” he further explained, noting that land costs currently represent a major hurdle for the deployment of solar parks in Malta, and that a competitive alternative could be found only in offshore waters.
The latest version of the floating structure, called Solaqua 2.1, has a modular configuration and will be made of light concrete or similar materials. “We had established, based on modeling, that bigger is better, both for cost and reliability,” Mule'Stagno stated, adding that each structure should provide enough surface to install between 40 and 50m2. The modules would be tied together by ropes or chains and would not form a rigid structure.
With this technology, which is currently being patented, the solar modules sit well above the water level. “To minimize cost, we envision the modules to be constructed of light, reinforced concrete or, eventually, recycled material elements,” the professor emphasized, adding that the structure can also be utilized with standard modules that are currently available on the market. “We have also developed an innovative cooling method using the abundant supply of seawater,” he added. “This method is also being patented and will be used on the Solaqua system, but will also be applicable on land-based systems.”
The structure is claimed to be able to stand waves that could be 6m high, and a small 1:25-scale prototype successfully went through first wave tests in a 2m deep wave tank. “We tested the prototype at the studios of Malta Film Commission, which have wave generators,” Mule'Stagno explained. “But they were not calibrated so our first task was to calibrate the wave generators, followed by testing.”

With the first version of the prototype, called Solaqua 1, the research team wanted to demonstrate that a moored structure could indeed survive in the open sea and it modeled which shape and size would behave best in central Mediterranean waves. “We tested several concepts – from a steel structure to a coated polystyrene raft,” Mule'Stagno stated. “The systems survived in the water for three years with no problems before they were removed.”
The Maltese scientist is targeting to design the structure to work with a sea depth of over 50 meters, which would be as close to shore as possible to minimize the cost of cables. This depth is also considered ideal as the PV system may have only a limited impact on the ecosystem below the panels.
The Maltese scientists are planning to deploy the first prototype in offshore waters in 2023. “It must be located where environmental conditions are the same as those of the Mediterranean sea,” said Mule'Stagno. The system is expected to have a maximum capacity of 150 kW and to utilize standard PV modules and inverters.
The development of the system was initially funded by the Malta Council for Science and Technology, followed by funding from the Maritime Seed Award and the Maltese energy regulator via the Research Trust of the University of Malta. “So this has so far been a completely Maltese funded project,” Mule'Stagno added. “Discussions are under way for the development of the full-scale open-sea trial, Solaqua 3, which we hope to launch next year.”
According to him, different modules will be tested in the future and some standard modules have already been tested successfully. “We are currently in talks with several entities about the funding and eventual exploitation of this technology in Malta and elsewhere,” the professor concluded. “However, we are open to collaborations with any partners who could make this technology a reality.”

pv magazine: How big is the potential for solar minigrids in India? Which load sizes and applications do these make more sense for? 
Jaideep Mukherjee: The minigrid sector has played a critical role in providing access to reliable electricity in rural India. The reliability of electricity enhances not only productive use but also spurs micro-enterprise activities in villages. Despite universal electrification of villages and households, there is still a major gap between demand and supply characteristics. 
SPI has been working to improve healthcare infrastructure and create socio-economic opportunities for rural and micro-entrepreneurs. As of now, electricity from the 300+ renewable energy grids supported by us has reached 432 villages and has helped in transforming the lives of over 337,473 people.
The solution for electrifying most of rural India lies in minigrids with 15 kilowatts to 100 kilowatts of peak power, enabled by storage that can electrify 100 to 140 households, 50 to 60 shops, and a mix of productive users.
Is the awareness level enough to get consumers connected? How can adoption be improved? 
Before the pandemic, more than 800 million people worldwide used to lack access to electricity. The pandemic has pushed billions to the brink of losing their electricity access since they were unable to pay their bills. This toll fell disproportionately on the poor and most vulnerable. 
Communication is crucial for minigrids to influence demand, overcome barriers, communicate benefits, and recruit clients. Structured communication can facilitate awareness and education about the benefits of minigrid adoption.  
In recent years, effective communication has evolved from haphazard awareness-raising activities to systematic, evidence-based behavior change communication strategies.
Energy service companies (ESCOs) must develop a communication plan for minigrid initiatives that addresses individuals, homes, and the community independently in order to encourage behavior changes.
SPI has been working to improve adoption through community action. We have worked with Women Self Help Groups, who have immense understanding of the villages they live in and the issues they face.
One of the ways women have played an integral role in providing reliable power is by performing billing and collection duties, as seen on the Model Distribution Zone (MDZ) Program in the Paradeep division of Odisha. In this program, ‘Bijuli Didi’s’ were recruited, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and also generating livelihoods. 
A total of 160 rural women were employed as bill connection associates with a potential monthly income of INR 8,000 ($107).
What are the other major barriers to mini-grid implementation? How big a problem is the availability of technical skills from implementation to operation? 
Though the minigrid sector has been making huge strides in India, there remains uncertainty about policy regulations such as downstream infrastructural subsidies and clear financial frameworks for implementation.
Minigrid developers face high costs as mini-grids are established in villages with low education levels and low operational efficiency of manpower.
Also, when the electricity demand is low, the plant is inefficiently used. The low demand also results in a higher tariff burden for consumers.
Due to ineffective feed-in tariffs and ambiguous terms of sale, the numerous actions available when the grid arrives, such as selling power to the grid or purchase by the (electricity distribution companies), may prove less efficient.
Furthermore, minigrids in India still lack specially designed technological components. Inverters used in Indian minigrids, for example, are not designed for this application. Furthermore, imported components, such as smart meters, are exorbitantly priced due to import fees and customs duties.
How can the cost be minimized for minigrid implementation, given that these projects are relatively small in scale? 
Minigrids – smaller off-grid electricity distribution networks – are being recognized as a cost-effective solution to bring power to rural communities that often lack access to a traditional power grid.
Solar minigrids have a considerably lower initial investment than traditional electricity sources such as thermal or coal facilities. On the other hand, the latter benefits from enormous economies of scale and has a longer lifespan. As a result, the levelized cost of electricity (during their lifetime) is significantly lower than that of solar.
It’s critical to concentrate on technological advancements like improved batteries, energy-efficient products, and low-cost mini-grid components. These will lower the initial investment and speed up the adoption of minigrids. 
Standardization, metering, automated billing and collection, and inverter and charge control electronics helped improve mini-grid component integration.
Smart Power India has developed a set of services to support energy-based microenterprises like irrigation units, oil expellers, rice hullers, water treatment at the village level as part of the Micro Entrepreneurship Development (MED) program. With access to reliable power, these enterprises are likely to employ relatively expensive and sophisticated appliances for productive purposes, which, in turn, helps in increasing power demand.
The market has seen emergence of many off-grid solar players? What role do they have to play other than just providing solar solutions? 
In a country where 70% of the population lives in rural areas and has a 3.2-crore micro-entrepreneurs base, ensuring the sustainability of rural electricity supply down to the last mile remains a major challenge. More than half of the population lacking reliable energy access lives in the States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal, and Madhya Pradesh.
Reliable energy access encourages micro-enterprises to opt for off-grid resources like micro or mini-grids. Some businesses meet their energy needs with fossil fuels such as diesel and kerosene. Such businesses willingly switch to cleaner electricity sources when subsidized fuel is no longer available to meet lighting needs or power high-wattage motor loads. 
Off-grid solar players have innovated business models to drive energy demand by handholding and enabling local enterprises to scale up. The business model encourages trust-building between enterprises and energy service companies by understanding their energy needs and offering reliable solutions for business growth. 
When local business owners achieve scale in their operations, it leads to increased energy demand and economic activity in the area. Mentoring from off-grid solar companies aids in the modernization and expansion of operations by facilitating marketing connections and entrepreneurial skill training.
Many benefits accrue to businesses due to mentoring, including up to a 50% increase in productivity, business expansion, increased household income, and, even more importantly, livelihood opportunities for the local community. Then there are benefits to energy companies in terms of ensuring increased and stable demand for their power. 
How do minigrids prove their relevance in a scenario where standalone solar systems (pay-as-you-go) become more accessible and feasible? Do you see minigrid defection happening?
Typically, there are two types of solar power plants – off-grid and grid-connected.
An off-grid system, popularly known as a standalone solar electrical system, is the main energy source in areas where no source of electricity is available. The main advantage of this system is that it does not depend on the grid or any other source of electricity.
A storage battery system acts as an essential component in providing electricity at night. Popular examples of the standalone solar system are solar lanterns, solar home lighting systems, and solar water pumping systems.
In recent years, several energy service companies, especially in East Africa, have appeared on the market, combining pay-as-you-go concepts with the sale of photovoltaic systems or electricity produced by these devices. Usually, this results in one-time installation costs and weekly/monthly payments.
When properly planned, an off-grid home solar system is an excellent cost-saving feature that can pay back the initial investment through electricity bill savings within the first five years of operation. However, when designed with revenue generation in mind, a grid-connected home solar system can be both a cost-saving feature and a revenue-generating system.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/12/new-research-points-to-cheaper-green-hydrogen-by-2030/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 12, 2021",New research points to cheaper green hydrogen by 2030,"From pv magazine Australia
Researchers at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, have developed a new open-source economic modeling tool to predict that solar-powered production of green hydrogen by electrolysis will fall to AUD 2 ($1.50) per kilogram by the end of this decade.
The Hydrogen Economic Fairways Tool (HEFT) – developed by researchers from Monash University in collaboration with Geoscience Australia – is a free online tool that assesses the economic viability of potential hydrogen operations across Australia. Stuart Walsh, a senior lecturer in resources engineering at Monash University, said that the tool can conduct detailed geospatial-financial analysis of future large-scale hydrogen projects.
It assesses the quality of energy resources such as wind, solar PV, concentrated solar power, steam methane reformation (SMR) with carbon capture and storage (CCS), and coal gasification with CCS. It also considers other associated costs such as transportation, infrastructure and storage.
“It’s a tool we’ve developed in collaboration with Geoscience Australia to identify regions of potential development of new hydrogen projects,” Walsh told pv magazine. “In particular we’re looking at those areas which are best suited for developing hydrogen projects from an economic perspective.”
The Australian government has committed to green hydrogen – generated by electrolysis powered by solar PV and wind energy – as a fuel for the future. It has formally recognized it as a “priority technology” in the Technology Investment Roadmap announced late last year.
Walsh said that modelling completed using the HEFT, with tech cost reduction forecasts provided by financial research company BloombergNEF, shows that the AUD 2/kg goal is achievable.
“It’s definitely possible, especially over that 10-year time frame,” he said. “A lot can change over that period but if the Bloomberg numbers hold up, keeping in mind they are a bit optimistic, then our model predicts you can get to that AUD 2 farm gate production target.”
The HEFT modeling indicates that off-grid hydrogen production using solar PV could be as low as AUD 2/kg by 2030. Adding water and delivery costs would lead to a hydrogen cost just below AUD 3/kg before shipping.
“The Bloomberg figures are generally accepted as being fairly optimistic estimates, but nevertheless they provide one baseline against which you can judge what the potential future cost will be to produce hydrogen in different places,” Walsh said. “We’ve seen even over the last couple of years the estimated price of what it costs to produce hydrogen has fallen quite dramatically and people are also predicting that it will continue to fall which is in line with those predictions.”
The Australian federal government is keen to capture a significant share of the growing global export demand for green hydrogen. State governments have also embraced this vision, with specific goals in support of the development of a hydrogen industry.
The HEFT is an open-source modeling tool, freely available via Geoscience Australia’s AusH2 portal. The software has been designed to be as flexible as possible. There are also plans to expand the tool’s capabilities, with the aim of optimizing the development of shared infrastructure to facilitate large-scale hydrogen production and delivery, in order to attract investment into Australia’s hydrogen industry.
Further inclusions of battery, hydro, pumped hydro energy storage, and delivery infrastructures will be added to the tool. Large-scale hydrogen storage will also be incorporated in future works.
While large-scale hydrogen production has not yet been implemented in Australia, there’s a growing number of pilot, demonstration and small-scale projects in various development stages around the country. Walsh expects the rollout of small-scale projects to provide a more concrete base from which to judge green hydrogen production costs, but he said the early signs are promising.
“We’ve seen some early data that is at least in line with some of the more optimistic estimates so once we see how the projects pan out, it will provide a lot more certainty around the cost estimates,” he said.
Chanlong Wang, a project team member, is due to present the Hydrogen Economic Fairways Tool at the Energy Next Exhibition in Sydney in August. The event has been postponed to Aug. 25 to Aug. 26.
