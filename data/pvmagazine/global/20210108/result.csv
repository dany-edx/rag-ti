The company said the products will be shipped between 2022 and 2023 and the purchase price will be negotiated on a monthly basis according to market prices.
Shanghai-listed silicon wafer manufacturer, JYT Corporation, announced on Thursday that two supply agreements were signed with two major solar cell manufacturers for long-term wafer supply over the next three years. Through one deal, JYT will supply Tongwei with 960 million mono-crystalline silicon wafers from January 2021 to December 2023 based on market price. Under another agreement with Runergy, JYT will provide 946 million wafers in the same period. According to JYT, the total contract value of the two agreements is around RMB 8.95 billion ($1.36 billion).
Chinese panel provider Talesun announced on Tuesday that it sold five PV parks with total capacity of 130 MW to two major China state owned energy enterprises, the State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) and China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). Four of the five solar parks are located in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, while the other is in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, all in Northwest China. Talesun was the EPC contractor for the five projects.
Float glass maker China Glass Holdings has rejected a HK$1.64 billion ($212 million) takeover offer tabled by rival Xinyi Glass Holdings. Shareholders in control of 56.65% of China Glass – including its biggest shareholder, the state-owned Triumph Group, which has underwritten RMB 1.96 billion ($303 million) of the company’s obligations – have advised independent shareholders to follow them in rejecting the HK$0.90 ($0.12) per share offer as undervalued. In a response issued to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the China Glass board said the offer constituted a 30.2% discount on the net asset value of HK$1.29 per share of the business at the end of June at a time when glass shortages mean record prices are being achieved. The board also cast doubt on the claim by Xinyi, the de facto parent of photovoltaic glass business Xinyi Solar, that it had no plans to lay off workers. China Glass pointed to an emphasis on automation plans in recent financial updates issued by Xinyi Glass.
The response came a day after it was announced that shareholders in the Xinyi Energy solar project subsidiary of Xinyi Solar will vote on whether to spend an estimated RMB 2.27 billion to acquire 520 MW of project capacity from the PV glassmaker. Details of the the vote are expected by January 26.
Manufacturer JinkoSolar on Wednesday announced completion of its $100 million American depositary share offering. Each ADS comprises four ordinary shares. The offering raised a net $98.3 million for the business.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/08/irish-esb-to-add-100-mwh-of-fluence-storage-to-its-portfolio/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,IRELAND",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JANUARY 8, 2021",Irish ESB to add 100 MWh of Fluence storage to its portfolio,"Irish state-owned utility Electricity Supply Board (ESB) has kicked off the year by signing a deal over two storage projects with a combined capacity of nearly 100 MWh. With the agreement, the utility enters the club of Irish utility-scale battery owners for the first time. The company said it would further expand its storage project portfolio in the future.
Ireland, which features significant wind capacity, has become a hotspot for grid-scale storage development in Europe. The country features 40% renewable energy capacity and it's looking to increase that figure to 75% over the next years — a shift that requires significant battery storage capacity.
In this vein, ESB will develop a 60 MWh system in Dublin, and an additional 38 MWh storage system at the Aghada Generating Station in Cork. The aim is to provide storage capacity in times of high wind conditions and stability in low wind times. The Irish state utility is working with energy storage solution company Fluence and EPC service providers Powercomm Group and Kirby Group to realize the two projects.
“Fluence has extensive experience delivering energy storage for the Irish electric grid, from the country’s first battery energy storage project to the fastest system response time in the world,” said Paul McCusker, vice president of EMEA for Fluence. “We look forward to working with ESB on projects that will help Ireland meet its ambitious clean energy goals and provide a more flexible, reliable and sustainable power system.”
As the two projects were awarded in EirGrid’s T-4 capacity auctions, they have been primarily designed to fulfill a long-duration storage purpose. However, ESB said in its statement that it had equipped the systems with additional “flexible enabling technologies” with an eye to the country’s DS3 auctions. The later procurement exercise aims to provide flexibility and stability services, with other technical requirements such as a sub-second response time to frequency events. Fluence already has such systems in operation in Ireland.
During the T-4 auction, which closed in April 2019, EirGrid procured the required capacity to meet supply between October 2022 and September 2023. Hence, the commissioning date for the two projects is set for January 2022. The total awarded capacity reaches 7,412 MW, of which 212 are battery storage projects. The auction clearing price was €46.150/MW per year.
“Enabling technologies such as these fast-acting battery projects are crucial to support the grid and will facilitate ever more onshore wind, offshore wind and solar onto the electricity system in the coming decades,” said Paul Smith, head of asset development at ESB Generation and Trading. “These projects mark ESB’s first battery projects in Ireland which is another important step on the company’s low carbon transition journey, and in doing so, help us lead in the delivery of our national climate obligations.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/08/hard-carbon-for-a-high-energy-sodium-battery/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JANUARY 8, 2021",Hard carbon for a high energy sodium battery,"Sodium-ion batteries are a promising energy storage technology, one that has already seen limited commercialization in the stationary storage segment. And sodium-ion has attracted plenty of attention from researchers, since it offers an alternative to lithium-ion batteries that relies on much cheaper, more abundant materials.
In terms of energy density, sodium-ion technology is a little way behind lithium. This means it is widely seen as impractical for applications such as electric vehicles or consumer electronics, where the size and weight of the battery are a primary concern. A new discovery from scientists at the Tokyo University of Science (TOS), however, could be set to turn this assumption on its head.
A group at the university looked to carbon electrode materials to boost sodium-ion battery capacity, and developed a technique to fabricate a porous, hard carbon anode. The technique is described in the paper New hard-carbon anode material for sodium-ion batteries will solve the lithium conundrum, published in Angewandte Chemie, International Edition.
Key to the process is the use of magnesium oxide (MgO) as a ‘template’ for the size and structure of the pores. Particles of MgO are formed into a carbon matrix, and pretreated at 600 degrees Celsius, before acid leaching and carbonization at 1500 degrees Celsius completes the process. After a series of experiments to optimize the MgO template and calculate ideal fabrication conditions, the group was able to fabricate hard carbon with a capacity of 478 millamp-hours per gram, and 88% Couloumbic efficiency (charge transfer efficiency) at the first cycle.
Shinichi Komaba, Professor at TOS notes that previously the highest value reported for this material was 438 mAh/g, and this was achieved with processing at even higher temperatures. Calculations presented by TOS show that a sodium-ion battery utilizing this anode would operate at a slightly lower voltage difference than today’s standard lithium-ion batteries, but would still achieve approximately a 19% increase in energy density (1600 watt-hours per kg, versus 1430.)
“Our study proves that it is possible to realize high-energy sodium-ion batteries, overturning the common belief that lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density,” says Komaba. “The hard carbon with extremely high capacity that we developed has opened a door towards the design of new sodium-storing materials.”
Other battery concepts under investigation promise energy densities far beyond what TOS has achieved here, and it is not clear how much more performance could be squeezed out of this new concept. The work, however, could force researchers to think again about what is possible with sodium-ion batteries. The next step will be to evaluate the practicality of the approach, and whether the materials can maintain stability over many cycles, and reach a lifetime that’s at least comparable to today’s lithium-ion technology.

Sunpower started production of its P-series modules at the facility in February 2019 but at the end of that year decided to transform itself from a photovoltaic manufacturer into a provider of rooftop PV arrays and storage systems. As part of the plan, it outsourced its production to Maxeon Solar Technologies, which now operates as an independent company.
 A shutdown of production in Hillsboro is expected to be implemented gradually from March to June. Sunpower expects that the 170 employees of the factory, which are mainly involved in manufacturing, will leave the company in the next three to six months, according to a statement. Restructuring costs ranging from $10 million to $12 million are assumed, of which up to €5 million are calculated for severance payments, with the rest being costs for the termination of real estate leases, closure and other related costs. These costs, all of which are intended to be paid in cash, would mainly be included in the first and second quarters of the current fiscal year.
Sunpower hopes to complete restructuring in the third quarter. However, a back door still remains open. Just one day after the planned restructuring was announced, Sunpower said it was also examining other options. A sale of the plant for continued operation via a joint venture or other potential partnerships cannot be ruled out.

French renewable energy developer Valorem has secured a power purchase agreement for a 5 MW agrivoltaic project it is developing in the Dordogne department in southwestern France.
Starting from the summer of 2021, the Tour-Blanche solar facility will sell power to the green electricity supplier, Enercoop, over a 30-year period. With a view to integrating local players, Valorem opened up the project capital to Enercoop and local energy company SEM 24 Périgord energies, which acquired to 2% and 37%, respectively. SEM 24 is a semi-public energy company operating in the Dordogne, which invests in renewable energy projects facilitating the energy transition.
Dutch lender Bank Triodos, which focuses on sustainable and ethical banking activities, financed the project through senior bank debt as well as a VAT bridging loan for a total debt amount of €3.5 million.
The project, which is said to offer a second life to land that is not very valuable because of its low agronomic potential, is being developed with the support of the Chamber of Agriculture. It is scheduled to start commercial operations in a few months and has been designed to accommodate sheep grazing. Valorem also signed an agreement on December 18 with a young breeding couple so that they could set up their pastoral activity within the park itself. They will thus benefit from a fenced, secure, shaded and paid area.
Valorem has already successfully implemented a similar project at the Lassicourt park in Aube, the company said.
Agrivoltaic is seeing strong development in France, especially through the tenders for innovative PV projects. In the latest round, finalized last week, the French Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) allocated around 80 MW of agrivoltaics. The Tour-Blanche solar farm, however, is being developed outside of France's tender scheme for solar.

The decision was taken to resolve a legal dispute between Liander and an agricultural entrepreneur that was denied grid access due to a lack of capacity in the Flevoland province in the central Netherlands, where the planned solar power generator was planned to be located. Flevoland is one of the Dutch regions with stronger grid congestion. Currently, new applications for transmission capacity are placed on a waiting list when all capacity in a given area has been allocated.
According to ACM, Liander demonstrated that it had no transport capacity for the agricultural entrepreneur, although the denial of grid connection was insufficiently explained at the time of the complaint. “This is an important statement by ACM about the way in which regional network operators should act in the event of a shortage of transmission in the electricity network,” said Huibert Baud, Liander's strategy and innovation manager.
In November, Netbeheer Nederland, the Dutch association of grid operators and electricity and gas providers, and the Dutch renewable energy associations De Nederlandse Vereniging Duurzame Energie (NVDE) and HollandSolar signed a preliminary agreement to ensure a faster and cheaper grid-connection of large-scale solar power plants to the network. PV plant operators will be able to connect their projects at 70% of their capacity and, in turn, they will be allowed to connect them without having to wait for more grid availability.
Furthermore, in May, the Dutch government decided that grid operators are not obliged to compensate the owners of solar rooftops whose arrays are disconnected due to problems with grid capacity and voltage quality.
Grid capacity issues are dogging the provinces of Gelderland and Noord-Holland and parts of Flevoland, Friesland and Zuid-Holland as well as areas in Groningen, Drenthe and Overijssel, in the northeast of the country. A year ago, Liander said it expected strong PV growth in the next five years, and is taking measures to ensure it will be sustainable. “A scenario that we are considering is that over the next five years the capacity of solar energy in Liander's service area will grow to 6 GW, which is six times more than that currently connected to the grid,” said the utility at the time.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/08/there-is-no-clear-best-module-configuration-under-partial-shading/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SLOVENIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 8, 2021",‘There is no clear best module configuration under partial shading’,"Scientists from the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia have analyzed for a year how partial shading affects different kinds of cut cell PV modules and have concluded that the best panel configuration to avoid energy losses depends on the specific installation conditions of the modules and micro shading conditions rather than on the module design only.
In the paper Annual energy losses due to partial shading in PV modules with cut wafer-based Si solar cells, published in Renewable Energy, the researchers explained that their comprehensive annual energy performance model is aimed at achieving a 3D shading profile for detailed shading analysis at the cell level, including cell thermal conditions. They analyzed the behavior of five different module topologies together with three shading objects, with the annual energy yield simulations being performed for the following five locations: Ljubljana, Slovenia; Freiburg, Germany; Helsinki, Finland; Cairo, Egypt; and Denver, Colorado, in the U.S.
The five crystalline silicon module typologies included: a standard 60 full-size squared 156 × 156 cm2 cell module as a reference panel (T1); a module of one-sixth area (1/6) rectangular cells with vertical cell connections with six strings in parallel and two strings in series of 6 × 32 1/6 cells strings (T2); a panel relying on one-sixth area (1/6) rectangular cells with vertical cell connections with six strings in parallel and three strings in series of 6 × 21 1/6 cells strings (T3); a module of one-sixth area (1/6) rectangular cells with vertical cell connections with six strings in parallel and four strings in series of 6 × 16 1/6 cells strings (T4); and a device of 1/6 cells with 10 strings in parallel made of 38 cells in series (T5). In all modules, the cell number was chosen to maximize the area fill factor of the panels.
“Modules T2, T3 and T4 are connected in such a way that their external electrical parameters are similar to the conventional 60 full-size cell PV module and can thus be used with established system components,” the academics specified. “The T5 module is of different topology that results in a higher short-circuit current of almost 15 A, and lower open-circuit voltage of slightly under 30 V.”
The shading analysis of PV systems was performed through an LTSpice simulator with three shading objects: a chimney with a height of 1 m; a chimney with a height of 2 m; and a pole with a height of 1 m above the lowest point of the module and situated 1 m in front of the bottom-left corner of the module.
The measurements showed that the T2, T3 and T4 modules suffered lower shading losses than the standard T1 module and the T5 module in portrait orientation. “Our simulations show that the new type of modules with cut cells, regardless whether the module has a shingled or a classical cell interconnection design, behave better or are less sensitive to partial shading,” the Slovenian group explained. “The reason is not in the cell size, since a smaller cell can get totally shaded sooner, but in the parallel connection of the cells,” it specified, adding that the cell parallel connection is generally preferable to reduce shading losses.
It also specified, however, that a combination of the shade type and the panel orientation is also very important. “If the orientation of the series connected substrings is in line with the orientation of the shape of the shade, the power loss will be reduced,” it stated. Referring to the module/shade orientation alignment, the researchers said that locations with a lower diffuse light share during the shading hours are more susceptible to losses.
“Based on the simulations presented herein, we conclude that there is no clear best module configuration,” the scientists concluded, noting that the best solution consists of adapting the PV system to its specific micro shading conditions. “In general, the orientation of the cells connected in series should be aligned with the shape of the shade as much as possible to reduce energy loss and to minimise cells’ reverse voltage.”

(NAWEC) is seeking consultants to conduct detailed energy and water audits of its water supply, distribution, and treatment systems in Banjul.
In the request for expression of interest document, the utility said that the selected consultants will have to assess and recommend opportunities to improve energy efficiency and load management. They will also need to look at ways to deploy a range of renewable energy options, including floating solar, rooftop PV, and solar pumps.
The state-owned company said that powering part of its water operations with solar will reduce the amount of electricity it needs to draw from its own power system. The winning consultants will need to identify the most energy-intensive equipment and processes and their specific energy consumption. In addition, they will need to look at ways to develop a detailed baseline of historical energy consumption and peak loads, while also considering equipment inventories and the technical characteristics of pumps, energy use, and peak loads for each of its major facilities.
“The consultants shall identify the peak electricity demand periods of NAWEC and estimate the benefits to the NAWEC Electricity system shifting pumping operations to off-peak periods,” the utility stated. “The consultants shall identify options for load shifting to off-peak periods including increasing reservoir capacity, and other actions to facilitate the shifting of the water pumping timings.”
The company is holding the tender with the support of the World Bank, under the auspices of the Gambia Electricity Restoration and Modernization Project, which was launched in 2018.
NAWEC launched a tender last year for a 20 MW solar project in the greater Banjul area. The solar project will be built on a 23-hectare plot of land allocated by the Ministry of Lands and Regional Governments and will include up to four PV plants ranging in size from 3 MW to 6 MW. In September, the West African Power Pool of the Economic Community of West African States also issued two tenders for consultants to develop a 150 MW solar plant that could be linked to energy storage.
Gambia had just 2 MW of installed solar capacity at the end of 2019, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Its 2 million people can call upon just 102 MW of total power generation capacity. The Gambian electricity network mainly consists of minigrids, which the government hopes to improve by transforming into hybrid facilities with renewables generation.
In 2013, Gambia introduced a Renewable Energy Act to promote clean energy, as it has an electricity access rate of just 35%.

Belgian grid operator Elia has reported that renewable energy sources, including solar and wind, saw their power production increase by 31% to 15.1 TWh in 2020 compared to the previous year, and now cover approximately 18.6% of electricity demand.


Impact of the Covid-19 health crisis
“This particular year was marked by an unprecedented health crisis,” Elia added. “However, it is difficult to perceive the direct impacts of this crisis on the electricity mix in Belgium. For example, we have not experienced any shutdown of production plants directly linked to Covid-19 as has happened in other countries.”
However, two major impacts were felt on Belgium's electricity system: the total consumption for the year 2020 was lower than the other years with a value of 81 TWh, which represents a 7% decrease compared to the average of the last five years. At the height of confinement, during the first wave, the reduction in consumption compared to a normal situation reached minus 25% at certain times of the day.
In August, consumption at times returned to and even exceeded the average of the last five years, mainly due to the heat wave. Average prices per megawatt-hour in the day-ahead market were at times lower than normal. For example, the lowest average day-ahead price (€ 14.7 / MWh) was reached in April. The average for the year was also the lowest since 2016. This is explained in particular by high renewable production during periods of confinement when electricity consumption was lower and by lower fuel prices (particularly gas).

Urban landscapes and man-made aerosols have the potential to accelerate the formation of hail storms, according to a recent study by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
The team, led by atmospheric scientist Jiwen Fan, created two storm models. One was for an area near Houston, Texas, while the other was in Kansas City, Missouri. The team simulated multiple versions of two storms, with and without the presence of cities and aerosols, in order to isolate the effects of these two distinct factors. They were always tested in tandem, as models of cities and aerosols independent of one another already exist.
The researchers found that urban land and aerosols worked together to amplify the frequency of large hail by roughly 20% in Kansas City. The Houston storm was “gentler” by comparison, but still resulted in amplified, longer-lasting rainfall that developed sooner than expected.
The Houston storm was not modeled as a hailstorm, but as a sea breeze-induced thunderstorm. The study followed earlier research that concluded that cities are warmer than surrounding areas because buildings absorb and retain the sun’s heat differently than trees and agricultural land, and also block wind flow.
Solar's role
The Kansas City model is one that could prove particularly troubling for the solar industry. In the PNNL model, heat from the city was carried downwind, where it met the storm just after its formation at the northern urban-rural boundary. When warmer, drier air met with cooler, moister rural air, it intensified convergence.
This  eventually led to a more violent storm that moved toward urban land. When the aerosols were modeled alongside the urban landscape, the two combined to amplify hail, producing a more hazardous hailstorm.
Hail has long been a concern for utility-scale solar installations in rural areas. In 2019, a hailstorm in Pecos County, Texas, damaged more than 400,000 panels at the 178 MW Midway Solar Project. The Pecos storm was one of a handful of extreme weather events in the past two years which have hardened the market for property and casualty insurance for solar projects. Premiums have risen by as much as 400% over that time.
The researchers found that urban landscapes and aerosols are capable of pushing more violent storms toward cities. This could create additional uncertainty when it comes to insuring urban distributed solar projects. While the financial risks for a distributed solar project are less than those of utility-scale installations, insuring them against hail could still prove difficult if urban hailstorms become more common and violent. A single PV project could be subjected to multiple extreme storms over its lifespan.

VSUN, a subsidiary of Australian Vanadium (AVL), this week appointed Western Australian engineering specialist Cadds Group to handle design and consultancy work for a new 5 kW/30 kWh vanadium redox flow (VRFB) battery for residential applications.
The VRFB, which was manufactured by China's CEC, has already arrived in Australia. However, in a deal signed in September, AVL agreed to further develop the battery for the Australian market.
AVL Managing Director Vincent Algar said that Cadds will design a new housing for the VRFB system and will oversee any changes needed to improve the battery for Australian residential conditions.
“We are looking forward to working with CADDS Group to develop the design for the residential VRFB,” Algar said. “This will give us the opportunity to provide feedback to CEC and ensure that the product is ideal for the Australian market.”
The VRFB will be tested at Cadds' headquarters in Perth. Upon successful completion of testing, VSUN will deliver the unit to a residential customer with a single-phase system for tests that will be completed in a residential environment with solar energy input. VSUN expects the battery to be market-ready early this year.
“By initiating market growth in smaller systems we anticipate a knock-on effect for larger VRFB uptake, which in turn will grow the market for vanadium pentoxide in energy storage,” Algar said.
Lithium-ion batteries currently dominate the residential market, but VRFB tech is gaining traction, with advocates declaring that such storage systems are safer and more reliable. Notably, vanadium flow batteries don’t degrade with cycling like lithium-ion options, and they can move electricity without generating heat. VRFB manufacturers have typically pursued utility-scale storage projects, but increasingly they are targeting the residential market.
In addition to the work VSUN Energy is undertaking with CEC, the company has ordered two 5 kW/30k Wh VRFBs from V-Flow Tech in Singapore. One is for a residential customer in Western Australia, while the other is to be installed at the Beverley Caravan Park in the state, where it will be paired with a 6 kW solar system.
