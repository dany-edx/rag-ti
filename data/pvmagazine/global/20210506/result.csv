Solid Power began producing smaller, 20 amp-hour solid-state battery cells at its Colorado pilot facility in late 2020, and says that its own testing shows stability over more than 250 cycles and capability of continuous discharge at rates beyond what an accelerating vehicle would require. With the latest round of investment, the company expects to begin scaling these up to produce “full-scale automotive batteries,” ready to begin the process of integration into electric vehicles.
Batteries of the future
Solid-state batteries are viewed by many as the most promising pathway in new battery technologies, with the potential to allow for much larger storage capacities than today’s lithium-ion products whilst also overcoming many of the safety and degradation issues associated with them.
“Solid-state battery technology is important to the future of electric vehicles, and that's why we're investing directly,” said Ted Miller, Ford's manager of Electrification Subsystems and Power Supply Research. “By simplifying the design of solid-state versus lithium-ion batteries, we'll be able to increase vehicle range, improve interior space and cargo volume, deliver lower costs and better value for customers and more efficiently integrate this kind of solid-state battery cell technology into existing lithium-ion cell production processes.”
While the interest of major automobile players is a clear sign of the technology’s potential, it may still be a while before solid-state batteries begin to make any market impact. Solid Power says that from the beginning of 2022 it will be able to supply the “full-scale” 100 amp-hour cells to Ford and BMW, who will begin to qualify and test them for use in electric vehicles.
By focusing on “manufacturability” from the start, Solid Power claims it has been able to accelerate the development of the technology ahead of many other research institutes and companies. “a breakthrough battery will not find a place in the market if it can't be produced at scale with acceptable costs,” said Dr. Jeff Chamberlain, CEO of Volta Energy Technologies. “The fact that Solid Power is already producing multi-layer all-solid-state batteries using industry-standard automated commercial manufacturing equipment is why Volta is excited to ramp up its earlier investment. The company's partnership with BMW and Ford will further accelerate the full commercialization of Solid Power's batteries.”

The finance, which complies with the green loan principles stipulated by London-based lending-market membership body the Loan Market Association, will finance “biomass and other renewable energy projects in South Africa,” said the IFC, the private-sector arm of the World Bank.
“Africa's green transition requires considerable mobilization of funds,” said Jason Quinn, interim group chief executive for Absa. “The agreement with [the] IFC bolsters our funding available for green projects and strengthens Absa's position as a leader in financing renewable projects in South Africa.”
The news came just a day after the IFC said it would help the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Ghana draw up guidelines for the issue of green bonds. The IFC said it had issued “roughly” 170 green bonds, worth more than $10 billion, in 20 currencies.
The Ghana initiative is part of the multilateral lender's green bond market development program, which is backed by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, and the government of Luxembourg.
“Finding new avenues for green financing is a key priority for [the] IFC,” said the development lender's country manager for Ghana, Ronke Ogunsulire. “Our partnership with the SEC to design the framework for green bonds in Ghana will, in turn, help Ghana achieve its climate goals with projects that create jobs and spur economic growth.”

The solar and wind developer has, according to previous owners Enterprise Investors, secured contracts-for-difference top-up payments on the wholesale energy price from the Polish government for 177 MW of solar generation capacity.
There also appears to be a potential mismatch in the estimated size of the solar project pipeline held by Wento, with Equinor stating its new subsidiary has plans for “more than 1 GW” of further solar projects. Enterprise Investors, signaling the sale on its website – for reported gross proceeds of €139 million on the investment – said that pipeline is significantly more than 1 GW, at “1.6 GW of solar projects in different stages of development.”
The website of Enterprise Investors, which has a New York office, suggests the private equity business emerged out of the Polish-American Enterprise Fund set up by the U.S. government to aid small businesses in Poland in the early 1990s.

Florida-based e-mobility company Evlomo Inc and Japanese-Thai business park operator Rojana Industrial Park Public Co Ltd have announced plans to invest “up to $1.06 billion” into a joint venture to establish the gigagfab, with Rojana – itself a JV – set to invest in a 55% stake.
A press release issued by Evolomo about the plans, said groundbreaking on the first stage of the factory, in Nong Yai in the province of Chonburi, is expected to take place this year, with first-phase construction slated to require 18-24 months. That leaves open the slender possibility of production starting next year, although production lines are more likely to fire up in 2023.
Evlomo said the fab would produce batteries for two and four-wheeled vehicles, including buses and “heavy vehicles”, and would also manufacture, unspecified “energy storage solutions.”
The U.S.-based e-mobility business said the gigafactory, to be sited in the Eastern Economic Corridor special economic zone which spans three provinces in eastern Thailand, would create more than 3,000 jobs.
“The investment will play the role of vitalizing the EV [electric vehicle] industry in Thailand,” said Kanit Sangsubhan, secretary-general from the eastern economic corridor office. “We look forward to Thailand becoming a global hub for [the] R&D, manufacturing and adoption of advanced energy storage and EV technologies in [the] entire South East Asia [region].“

On April 29, the Algerian government published a decree in the country's official journal empowering Chitour's ministry to manage and oversee the procurement exercise.
“The tender will be launched between June and July,” the president of Algerian think tank Club Energia, Mouloud Bakli, told pv magazine. “It will be divided into ten lots of 100 MW each and will allow projects that will be planned with foreign financing.”
He also explained that, currently, the government is working on putting together a bankable power purchase agreement for the selected projects and that some domestic content requirements for cables, modules and mounting structures should be embedded in the tender. “The PPA may possibly be dollar-linked,” Bakli stated.
Another three tenders of the same size are expected to be issued each year between 2022 and 2024.
The Algerian government held tenders for off-grid, hybrid solar-diesel and PV projects in 2019. Both procurement rounds were part of the country’s plan to deploy 22 GW of clean energy generation capacity by 2030, including 13.6 GW of solar.
Algeria had around 423 MW of solar generation capacity at the end of last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

The three speakers from our pv magazine webinar on 26 April have taken the time to answer more of the questions posed by the audience during the live broadcast. Click here to view the webinar and access presentations.
Simon Meijer: PID resistance is a combination of parameters set by the manufacturer of the solar module and their choice of materials.
Alex Masolin: PID occurs when there is a high voltage potential between the internal electrical circuit and the frame of the PV module. Humidity and temperature are known to accelerate PID and these can be influenced by the solar cell design, module glass selection, and system grounding strategies. Coolback provides the backsheet and aluminum profiles and thus has no influence on the selection of other materials needed to manufacture a solar module.
AM: Direct comparison between Coolback and bifacial technology is not possible, due to the major differences in the laminate. It can, however, be said that bifacial gains are heavily dependent on the rear irradiance (albedo, shading from mounting structure or wiring…) and optimization of such [a] set-up is not straightforward. Sometimes, such optimization is not even possible. For example, on floating installations, where albedo is extremely low, the benefit of using a bifacial module is hindered. On the other hand, Coolback is more resilient to possible inaccuracies of the plant design and, therefore, equipped to provide an enhanced energy gain in more situations, compared to bifacial.
AM: Coolback covers the back side of the module. This works to expand the surface area and to replace the frame. Bifacial modules are, in principle, able to use Coolback, but this will block the functioning of solar harvesting at the rear side of the cell. For this reason, we primarily focus on monofacial modules.
SM: The energy output of bifacial modules varies per location, but also over time. This makes a straightforward estimate difficult to calculate. Also, the cost of bifacial modules might be higher than Coolback modules. A detailed plan should be evaluated for a more accurate calculation.
AM: Coolback is designed to tackle the high operating temperature of a PV module, which mainly occurs in hot climates. Indeed, the gains are reduced in cold climates or in very windy regions. Nevertheless, even in the worst case, a Coolback module will perform at least as well as a framed reference module with the same laminate. It also provides superior mechanical strength in any climate, reducing degradation and extending module lifetime.
SM: Since the modules are frameless, transport and mounting can cause vulnerability to the laminate. To reduce the risk of damage here, safety corners are applied during production and can be removed after installation.
AM: 30-40% more Coolback modules can fit on a pallet, compared to conventionally framed modules.
Thanks to the rear cooling fins of the Coolback module, the modules can be stacked back-to-back for transport. The position of the aluminum profiles and fins is designed to make the most efficient use of space when stacked. Stacking aids have been developed to allow for the safe transportation of the modules and allow 30-40% more modules on a pallet than conventional framed modules.
Furthermore, the rigidity of Coolback modules prevents microcracks during handling, transport and installation in the field.
SM: There is no added cost per Wp in using the Coolback system, which replaces the conventional backsheet/frame and mounting system at a competitive price. Additionally, the increased energy output and module lifetime results in a lower LCOE.
SM: Modules with Coolback are available from May 2021. We do not produce modules ourselves but instead deliver our patented technology to module manufacturers for integration with their own products. We also offer the option to license our technology, including the lease of a Coolback assembly station for high-speed production, which follows standard operating procedures.
Coolback is continually expanding its certification of different module brands. It is currently certified on modules from HaiTai and Sunerg.
AM: Our solution is designed to exceed the strictest requirements, in terms of safety. The inner insulating component is over-engineered to ensure proper insulation with no risk of defect for the entire life of the module. The Coolback backsheet is IEC certified by TÜV for 1500-volt systems and validated for extended aging tests to ensure reliability and full system safety in every climate condition during the module’s entire lifetime.
AM: Aluminum deformation due to temperature changes are extremely limited and easily absorbed by the design configuration and by the inner plastic part, with no influence on the cells. Coolback modules have been extensively tested in the most severe environments with extreme temperature differences, and have shown no problems.
Andreas Beinert: Additionally, FEM simulations are used to investigate thermal expansion and contractions. By this digital prototyping, critical temperature changes can be identified in the computer, rather than the field, and the design can be optimized accordingly.
SM: Coolback is a perfect solution for floating PV installations, due to its waterproof moisture barrier and cooling performance. Testing installations are ongoing in some areas. A large project on the sea is currently in development. This installation will benefit enormously from the superior mechanical strength of the Coolback System to protect against severe sea weather conditions.
AM: Yes, fully compatible with every standard encapsulating material and process. The backsheet can be used as a standard backsheet without requiring line modification, and with using the standard lamination recipe.
Coolback will also be participating in our Roundtables Europe 2021 event, to be held on June 9 and 10. Click here to register!

Previous boss Tom Werner, who will stay on as chairman until September, reported a $413 million profit in his last three-month-earnings report.
In fairness to Faricy, he can point to the fact he did not take up office until last month, following his appointment on March 25 but, with SunPower admitting there is a chance revenue could fall further in the current window, from the $306 million just announced to $295-345 million, that excuse could soon evaporate.
The figures for SunPower, which is controlled by French energy company Total, were given a more positive sheen by the non-generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) of stripping out unfortunate red numbers for the last quarter. Non-GAAP net income of $9.3 million can be conjured up by simply removing the $7.1 million operations cost of a legacy business, $3.8 million of restructuring charges and $1 million of reorganization costs, all of which presumably relate to the hiving off of the company's solar manufacturing business into Maxeon last year. Take another $5 million worth of shares compensation packages out, a thumping $44.7 million hit on equity investments, and $5.2 million for unspecified “litigation costs” and hey presto! A quarterly profit emerges.
In terms of those annoying GAAP numbers, SunPower is predicting a more palatable second-quarter reverse of just $1-12 million, at least, and there is talk of healthy residential, small business and commercial and industrial custom during the first quarter, and rising interest in SunPower's energy storage products, even if the value of total inventory rose $20 million, from $211 million on January 3 to $231 million on April 4.
This copy was amended on 10/05/21 to reflect Peter Faricy did not take up office as SunPower CEO until April 19.

Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) is supporting the project as an adviser. It will oversee everything from factory planning to the joint development of advanced cell technologies, mainly by providing technical support. Furthermore, Germany-based engineering company Bosch Rexroth, a subsidiary of the better-known Robert Bosch conglomerate, is in charge of planning and designing the factory.
pv magazine contacted Greenland Capital and it confirmed a “major expansion of its headquarters in the free port of Seville.” However, it did not comment on its relationship with the module factory.
Greenland Giga Factory lists the Seville City Council as a partner in the project, and pv magazine is also listed as the first media outlet to have reported the news. The company's web portal also noted that it was launched in 2021 by Gerard Oostendorp, a native of the Netherlands.
The construction of the complex will begin in December of this year. The production of panels, cells and wafers will begin in December 2023.
In the first phase, the factory will manufacture products based on PERC technology (22.5% efficiency). It will then switch to TopCon tech (23.5% efficiency) and, finally, to an unspecified tandem technology (> 29% efficiency). The company has yet to provide any additional details.

The layer contains a mixture of methylammonium and formamidinium organic cations and is claimed to minimize the absorber bandgap. “Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) features the smallest bandgap to date, but this bandgap exceeds the optimal range for single-junction devices,” the scientists explained. “One way to reduce the bandgap of perovskites involves forming lead-tin alloys in the absorber, but this introduces crystal defects and instability.”
The layer was embedded in an inverted perovskite cell with a “p-i-n” layout between an electron transport top layer and a hole-transport bottom layer. Through this architecture, the PV device was able to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 22.8%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.1 V, and a short-circuit current of 26 mA/cm−2, which the research team described as the best performance for an inverted perovskite cell based on single-crystal methylammonium lead triiodide. “The rise in performance mainly stemmed from an increase in short-circuit current,” it specified.
“We had known that mixed-cation, single-crystal absorbers could outperform single-cation absorbers due to their lower bandgap and superior optoelectronic qualities,” said researcher Abdullah Alsalloum. “However, this had not been realized before because of challenges in crystal growth and device integration.”
The Saudi group is convinced that this cell design may deliver efficiencies close to that of gallium arsenide solar cells. “Future studies include optimizing device interfaces and exploring more favorable device structures,” Alsalloum added. ” Suggested future efforts include interface engineering and exploration of perovskite cells in more favorable architectures, such as lateral structures.”
The solar cell is presented in the paper 22.8%-Efficient single-crystal mixed-cation inverted perovskite solar cells with a near-optimal bandgap, published in Energy & Environmental Science.
The KAUST Solar Center has been working for years on ways to speed up the flow of charge carriers in perovskite crystals. It made some major investments in research over past years, and produced several steps forward in perovskite research as a result.

Solar manufacturers in India have lauded the production-linked incentive scheme (PLI) recently announced by the central government to encourage the development of a domestic industry, but they have also voiced some concerns. The PLI scheme – which aims to drive integrated PV manufacturing, from polysilicon to finished panels – uses the performance of the resulting products and planned manufacturing capacity as parameters for eligibility.
Bharat Bhut, co-founder and director of Gujarat-based Goldi Solar, told pv magazine that the PLI scheme provides a much-needed push to build a PV supply chain in India and sets the bar high for manufacturers. However, he said that he feels that the policy ignores micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), which will find it difficult to survive against bigger, integrated manufacturers targeted by the scheme.
“Very few companies or joint ventures will be eligible to apply for the scheme, completely leaving out MSMEs,” said Bhut. “Indian businesses usually start as small companies and expand to become bigger and larger organizations. With an integrated approach, only those with large manufacturing capacities will be able to sustain [operations] in such a competitive environment.”
Bhut said the government should include standalone module, cell, and raw material facilities under the scope of the program.
“Manufacturers from other countries will have an advantage, given their track record, R&D, capital, and experience,” Bhut added. “Indian companies will have to up the ante through R&D to offer better efficiency modules than the current offerings.”
Hitesh Doshi, chairman and managing director of Mumbai’s Waaree Group, said the PLI scheme is critically needed.
“India is the third-largest solar market in the world but the country imports over 85% of its panel requirements,” he said. “The nation can no longer afford to depend on imports [because of] concerns of losing huge employment opportunities. Hence, this is a great, welcome step, and it will benefit our country in many ways.”
Doshi urged the government to significantly enhance the budget of the scheme, to have a chance of weaning the nation off solar imports.
Gyanesh Chaudhary, managing director of Kolkata-based Vikram Solar, said he is hopeful that the government will provide a second tranche of PLI cash for solar manufacturers.
“Vikram Solar welcomes the [Ministry for New and Renewable Energy's] latest guidelines for the PLI scheme,” he said. “As a domestic solar manufacturer, we have high hopes from the PLI scheme as it promises to promote solar manufacturing in the country. This would solve the energy crisis, create jobs, increase investment, and bring technological innovation in the sector. It would also help India to achieve the renewable energy target set at the Paris Agreement well within the timeline.”
Chiranjeev Saluja, managing director of Telangana-based Premier Energies, told pv magazine that Indian manufacturers are planning significant investments in new cell and module production capacity, buoyed by supportive policies such as state projects which mandate domestic content, the national PLI scheme, and a customs duty on imports proposed from April 1, 2022. As a result, India could have a cell manufacturing capacity of more than 10 GW per annum next year. That would create demand for Indian solar ingot and wafer manufacture and, coupled with the PLI and proposed tariff on imported wafers, could drive investment in such “upstream” manufacturing.
Chinese solar manufacturers currently enjoy a cost advantage over Indian rivals due to their large, mature supply chains. Saluja told pv magazine that Indian solar manufacturing will be large within three to five years, and populated by multiple companies across the value chain. That will level the playing field for Indian manufacturers, enabling them to further invest in scale and technology and take significant market shares domestically and worldwide, said the spokesperson.
“Some Chinese manufacturers may invest in India to set up large plants but we see that happening in partnership with existing Indian players in solar manufacturing or power project developers,” said Saluja. “The existing cell [and] module manufacturers and power developers in India will be leading the charge.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/06/australias-recycling-opportunity-emerges-as-batteries-boom/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 6, 2021",Australia’s recycling opportunity emerges as batteries boom,"From pv magazine Australia
Batteries are becoming crucial enablers of Australia’s transition to renewable energy. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has identified an increase in battery usage across all sectors, including large-scale, distributed energy resources and the electrification of transport, as the driver for a potential AUD 3.1 billion ($2.4 billion) lithium-ion battery recycling industry.
First commercialized in the 1990s, lithium-ion batteries are a relatively new technology. But the market has undergone substantial growth in recent years and the CSIRO has predicted that demand for batteries will accelerate going forward.
“The demand for lithium-ion batteries is increasing globally, fueled by the increasing electrification of transport and the renewable energy generation storage sector,” said Dr. Anand Bhatt, lead author of the Australian Landscape for Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling and Reuse in 2020 report.
While the electric vehicle (EV) market remains negligible in Australia, accounting for just 0.7% of the 1 million new cars sold annually, the distributed and large-scale battery energy storage sectors continue to grow. Solar market research firm SunWiz has calculated that 31,269 new residential batteries, or 340 MWh, were installed across the nation last year. Data provided by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) indicates that since 2018, 8.9 GW of large-scale battery storage has been financially committed, proposed and or approved in Australia.
Clean Energy Council Chief Executive Kane Thornton said that growth is expected to continue in 2021, with 15 large-scale battery projects already announced this year, representing 6.6 GW of storage and AUD 4.3 billion in investment.
“The commercial case for batteries will continue to improve as battery technology advances and new markets are established to reward the services they provide,” Thornton said.
Australia’s largest energy retailer, AGL, is among those leading the battery charge. Last year it announced plans to add 850 MW of new large-scale battery storage to its energy generation portfolio by 2024.
The gen-tailer has already announced plans for a 250 MW battery project on the site of its retiring gas-fired Torrens Island Power Station in South Australia, along with a series of other mega-storage facilities. Developers led by Neoen, network owners such as Spark Infrastructure, and service providers such as Transgrid have also announced new battery projects.
However, the CSIRO has warned that as demand grows for energy storage and batteries, so too does the amount of lithium-ion battery waste. The science agency said lithium-ion batteries generally have a lifespan of five to 10 years (but current development trends are increasing this to 10 to 15 years). This, combined with batteries used in renewable energy storage systems, means a large volume of end-of-life batteries will soon be on our doorstop.
“This growth is leading to an emerging problem of end-of-life waste management,” Bhatt said.
CSIRO research shows that lithium-ion battery waste is growing by 20% a year and could exceed 100,000 tons by 2036. The agency said lithium-ion batteries pose environmental and safety concerns, but Associate Professor Jo Staines, enterprise fellow at the University of Melbourne and program lead for the Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre, said incorrect disposal is also a missed economic opportunity.
“Lithium-ion batteries contain valuable battery metals and materials that should be recycled and reused,” Staines said. “The conundrum we face in Australia is that we don’t currently have the volume of spent lithium-ion batteries to justify significant investment, but we want to keep them out of landfill to prevent environmental damage and retain those valuable battery materials in our economy.”
While companies like Melbourne-based Relectrify are pursuing opportunities to repurpose batteries, a 2018 CSIRO report indicates that only 2% of Australia’s lithium-ion battery waste is re-used or recycled.
“The value for Australia is threefold,” Bhatt said. “We can draw additional value from existing materials, minimize impact on our environment, and also catalyze a new industry in lithium-ion re-use/recycling.”
The latest report identifies 18 opportunities for industry, government and research institutions to strengthen and grow Australia’s domestic recycling capability. The CSIRO claims that Australia could lead the world in the re-use and recycling of lithium-ion batteries. Among those opportunities identified in the report are exploring a National Product Stewardship for all batteries and increasing research into developing end markets for the recovered battery materials.

The Global Renewables Markets Attractiveness Rankings tracks attractiveness for investment in offshore wind, onshore wind and PV. It placed the United States in the No. 1 spot for 2020, citing the country’s sound market fundamentals and the availability of an attractive support scheme.
The ranking evaluated each country on the basis of current policy framework, market fundamentals, investor friendliness, infrastructure readiness, revenue risks, return expectations, and overall opportunity. Each market was assessed in individual categories for solar PV, onshore wind, offshore wind and an overall renewables score.

The overall country rankings were based on a combined score for offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar PV that weighted the technologies based on their expected levels of installations over the next decade.
Mainland China, which accounted for more than half of the world’s total non-hydro renewables additions last year, ranked third on the attractiveness ranking, weighed down by difficulties in accessing the market. Germany finished second, while France and Spain secured the fourth and fifth spots, respectively, based on strong market fundamentals backed by stable procurement mechanisms and long-term clean energy targets. Similar factors boosted Japan to eighth place and the Netherlands to ninth.
Countries with a strong impetus toward offshore wind got a significant boost, as IHS said the generation source is expected to be the fastest growing renewable energy technology in the next decade.
Strong ambitions and stable procurement initiatives in India, as well as the availability of attractive subsidies and a high degree of investor friendliness in Australia, drove these markets to the sixth and seventh spots on the list.
The United States also retained the top ranking in individual technology rankings for investment attractiveness for solar PV and onshore wind. The United Kingdom failed to crack the top 10 in the combined rankings due to its relative lack of support for developing onshore wind and PV. It ranked individually as the most attractive market for offshore wind investment.
