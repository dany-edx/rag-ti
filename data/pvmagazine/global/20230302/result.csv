They are particularly suitable for detached houses and new builds.
The Vitocal 222-G comes in three versions, with heating outputw between 5.8 kW and 10.4 kW, and a COP of up to 4.8. It reportedly has a seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) of up to 5.4 for heating in cold climates. The maximum flow temperature is 65 C, which enables use with conventional radiators.
They come with an integrated hot-water cylinder, with the capacity to heat 220 liters of domestic hot water at a COP of 3.14. They can provide domestic hot water at a maximum temperature of 58 C. The minimum temperature of the ground source is -10 C and the maximum is 25 C.
The ground-source heat pump measures 680 mm x 600 mm x 2,000 mm. The 5.8 kW device weighs 277 kg and the 10.4 kW one weighs 288 kg. They use R410A refrigerant with a global warming potential (GWP) of 1,924.
“The casing of the compact appliance completely protects the refrigeration module/hydraulic compartment from the outside environment and, in conjunction with the three-dimensional anti-vibration mounts, minimizes operating noise,” Viessmann claims on the product’s website. The heat pump produces noise at 46 dBA, which is lower than refrigerator noise.
The Vitocal 222-G has recently been installed in a residence in the UK, where it is powered by a rooftop installation featuring 16 PV panels with 325 W output each, according to a Viessmann statement.
“The panels are controlled by an app, with the 5.2 kW of energy they generate stored in an 8.2kWh battery for later use,” the heating specialist said. “Energy not needed by the Vitocal heat pump is fully utilized by the household for things like immersion heating and electric vehicle charging, thanks to an export-limiting technology which caps feedback to the grid at 3.68 kW.”
Installing the ground-source heat pump required the digging of two 100-meter-deep boreholes, in a garden measuring 25 meters by 25 meters.
*This article was updated on 3/03/2023 to reflect the weight of the 10.4 kW heat pump is 288 kg, not 28 kg as previously reported.

On Feb. 21, 2023, approximately 5 GW of nameplate capacity in new-build batteries secured contracts in the 2026/27 T-4 Capacity Market auction – effectively doubling the United Kingdom's current pipeline of BESS projects.
Around 45% of the auctioned projects consist of two-hour duration storage systems. Around 770 MW came from BESS projects with four-hour duration, of which 94% are owned by Amp.
Utility-scale BESS projects have proliferated in Britain in recent years, supporting the United Kingdom's growing reliance on renewable energy sources. Grid stabilization services offered by BESS have also expanded in this deregulated market, improving the bottom lines of project stakeholders.
Aurora Energy Research Senior Associate Tom Smout told pv magazine that “battery projects have been performing well economically for the past few years, benefitting from a market with high energy prices and from increased requirements for lucrative frequency response services, for which the assets are particularly well-suited.”
However, Smout noted that large battery projects remain largely unproven in the United Kingdom.
“Our analysis has suggested that durations in the region of two hours are currently optimal in terms of investment return, but a significant component of this is upfront costs, so larger and longer projects may perform better if they achieve significant cost savings or are positioned to take advantage of local grid constraints,” he said.
According to the official documentation, which shows derated capacity, 1.29 GW of BESS projects secured contracts in the latest procurement exercise. The derated capacity is the nameplate capacity multiplied by the derating factor, adjusting for the expected availability of that technology during a system stress event.

T-4 auctions – Britain’s key procurement exercises – are usually held about four years in advance of the delivery date. Contracts of up to 15 years are available for new-build capacity in the auctions, while existing capacity can only secure one-year contracts.
In February, there were 143 winning battery storage units, more than 90% of which secured 15-year contracts. However, BESS projects accounted for only 3% of the total capacity awarded, with gas claiming the lion’s share of 67.5% of capacity market units.
The T-4 capacity auction cleared at GBP 63 ($71.07)/kW per year, representing the highest clearing price on record. The price was more than double the previous record due to record-low prequalifying capacity and higher capacity targeted by National Grid Electricity System Operator.
According to Aurora Energy Research, the auction procured only 600 MW more than the absolute minimum it could have procured, highlighting how expensive new projects have become, both in terms of absolute cost increases and growing uncertainty for investors.
The latest T-4 auction follows a boom year in 2022, when more than 1 GW of derated BESS capacity won contracts, up from around 250 MW of winning BESS capacity in 2021.

Scientists from Brazil, Colombia, and Germany have created a database of PV generation potential in every state in Brazil, using 2019 as the reference year for solar irradiation. The researchers aim to use existing energy data in Brazil – including the national electricity regulator's Siga database and data from the Energy Research Office (EPE) – and make it more easily accessible to the international community.
“By providing the first publicly available, spatially explicit, harmonized, English-language version of Brazil's energy data, we enable researchers to replicate the Brazilian energy system and/or improve integration into global energy models, starting from a common base,” the scientists said.
To calculate the solar generation potential of each state, the team used the Energy Data Analysis Tool (EnDAT), which until now was only available internally at the German Aerospace Center.
The model uses two maps to calculate the potential for solar generation – one that identifies exclusion areas, and another that serves as a suitability criterion for determining the available area. The maximum density of installations is calculated by taking into account the greatest shading effect on modules with an optimized angle for the winter solstice. The potential was determined for solar installations on rooftops, facades, other open urban areas, and areas suitable for large-scale ground-mounted installations.
In total, Brazil has the potential to install 337.83 GW of solar, according to the study. The results for all of Brazil’s 27 states are as follows:
The researchers described their model in “Harmonized and Open Energy Dataset for Modeling a Highly Renewable Brazilian Power System” which was recently published in Scientific Data. The dataset on potential installed capacity, as well as other information, can be accessed here.

BayWa AG says it wants to sell the PV product distribution business of its BayWa re subsidiary. It aims to use the sales proceeds to expand the unit's portfolio as an IPP to 3 GW, with the aim of tripling the size of its renewable energy project business by 2026. The German conglomerate said BayWa re's project pipeline currently comprises 24 GW of projects.
BayWa re's solar trade division has 20 distribution companies and more than 1,400 employees throughout the world. It says it has the potential to increase annual sales of solar modules and inverters to more than 10 GW. However, the Munich-based group did not provide details about the expected sales proceeds.
“With a powerful buyer, we have the opportunity to continue the extraordinary success story of the group that began in 2008,” said Klaus Josef Lutz, CEO of Baywa AG and chairman of the BayWa re supervisory board. “Today we are an important pacesetter in the energy transition. We generate more than half of our consolidated earnings with renewable energies.”
The strategic realignment is related to a capital increase launched at the end of 2020, according to a BayWa spokeswoman. Since then, Swiss investor Energy Infrastructure Partners (EIP) has taken a 49% stake in BayWa re, with parent BayWa AG holding a 51% stake. BayWa re has received €530 million ($563 million) as an equity contribution.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/02/guide-to-understanding-solar-production-losses/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 2, 2023",Guide to understanding solar production losses,"From pv magazine USA
When investing in solar, maximizing production is a common goal. Aurora Solar, a leading solar design and performance software provider, released a guide for understanding the leading causes of energy loss in PV systems, and how to avoid them. 
KWh Analytics, a climate insurance and renewable energy risk management firm, released its 2022 Solar Generation Index and reports that solar assets are broadly performing below expectations. Systems installed since 2015 have broadly underperformed expectations by 7% to 15%, with some regional difference. How can this underperformance be avoided?
Aurora Solar’s Ultimate Guide to PV System Losses includes basic solar performance concepts like the effect of tilt, orientation, and shade on production metrics. The guide walks through how mismatched equipment can cause losses and surveys the effects of incident angle modifiers, and module nameplate rating losses.
Tilt and orientation
The angle of panels affects the amount of solar irradiance the system receives over the course of a year. Tilting the array towards the equator will maximize incident irradiance, boosting production, the Aurora report notes.
Making the most of the solar incidence angle is important for production, too. Incidence angle refers to the angle of the panel’s surface compared to the sun’s rays. Incidence angles affect the amount of sunlight that gets through the glass on the front of the panel.
Aurora said that these losses, measured as the incident angle modifier, typically range between 3% to 4.5%. The DeSoto model is used to understand incidence angle modifier effects.
Soiling, or the buildup of dust and other debris on the surface of the panel, is a leading cause of energy loss in some regions. In areas with long dry seasons, it can lead to 5% losses. In regions with frequent dust deposits, it can add 1% to 2% to that figure, and locations near major traffic areas typically have another 1% in losses. In regions with year-round rain, soiling losses typically hover around 2%, Aurora said.
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) performance parameters suggests a 5% typical soiling loss in the United States is common. An NREL model found that having one annual cleaning on a system with 1.9% soiling loss would decrease the loss to around 1.5%. Two cleanings per year could drop the average loss to 1.3%, and three cleanings per year would reduce it further to a 1.2% average annual loss. An NREL locational analysis on soiling effects can be found here.
Birds and bird droppings are another production concern. Bird droppings substantially block one or two cells and may not wash away with rain. In modules without bypass diodes, one or two cells being entirely blocked could lead to the entire module losing operation. Aurora advises quick manual cleaning of bird droppings.
Snow loads are another mitigating factor. An NREL study calculated losses ranging from 10-30% for fixed-tilt systems. Snow factors can be difficult to model accurately on an annualized basis, so Aurora recommends measuring on a monthly format. A locational study on snow loss estimates based on various panel tilts can be found here.
Shading is another critically important aspect of system performance. Aurora likens a shaded solar cell to a clog in a pipe. When a cell is shaded, the current through the entire string of cells is reduced. Panels integrate bypass diodes, which allow the array to “skip over” the shaded cell, but at the expense of foregoing any production that could have been harvested from that cell. A Stanford University analysis of shading effects can be found here.
Aurora suggests using module-level power electronics (MLPE) or microinverters to avoid losses from shading.
Environmental losses
Temperature coefficients are another factor to consider in performance. A temperature coefficient is measured as the percentage energy output decreases for every 1-degree Celsius increase above the reference point of 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit).
Certain roofing materials will absorb more heat than others, affecting performance. Panel angles can alter temperature, and Aurora said flat mounted panels typically get hotter. Panel type makes a difference, too. Thin-film panels typically have a lower temperature coefficient than monocrystalline or polycrystalline solar panels.
Modules on systems with mismatched or long strings can lose another 0.01% to 3% of total production. Aurora uses an assumption of 2% in its modeling for this loss category. Mismatched modules with tight wattage tolerances can lead to another 1% system loss.
Light-induced degradation occurs when the electrical characteristics of crystalline silicon solar cells change when they’re exposed to light. Losses range from 0.5% to 1.5% and happen within the first few hours of the new panel’s exposure.
Module nameplate rating losses represent the loss due to the difference in the stated power of the module compared with how it actually performs at standard test conditions. Aurora suggests no loss occurs in this category for modern modules, as most accurately reflect standard test results.
However, some providers may list a performance range, referred to as “power tolerance”. It is typically expressed as a plus-or-minus percentage. For example, a 250 W panel with a listed +/- 5% power tolerance may produce between 237.5 W to 262.5 W.
Cable concerns 
Wiring losses typically contribute to another 2% in system losses. If the project uses thicker wires on short runs, those losses may be closer to 1%.
“Several components can cause a voltage drop in circuits, including connections, fuses, and resistors. Differences in cable length or size among the parallel strings can also introduce a voltage drop,” according to Aurora.
An NREL study modeled connection losses can contribute to another 0.5% loss. Wiring connectors and bypass diodes have physical imperfections that cause resistance, leading to small voltage drops.
Inverter efficiency measures how efficiently DC energy is converted to AC energy. Inverter manufacturers provide both a maximum efficiency rating for performance in ideal conditions, and a weighted efficiency rating for its performance over a range of conditions.
“It’s important to look at the weighted efficiency because an inverter’s efficiency will change based on the capacity it’s carrying. Most inverters peak around 20% load and fall slightly as the load reaches the maximum input rating,” said the Aurora report.
Inverter clipping often occurs in systems at the height of sunny days. When DC output from the panels is greater than the amount of DC power the inverter can convert, clipping loss occurs. Aurora’s NEC Validation Report can help properly size inverters.
Publicly available system performance model PVWatts uses a default value of a 3% system availability loss. Aurora said that systems with operations and maintenance or fault alert systems set up may experience availability losses of only 0.5%. Availability includes inverter shutdowns or failures, grid outages, and other events that disconnect the PV system.
Thermal expansion and contraction, UV light, and damage from windblown particles will reduce production over time. Solar panel manufacturer production guarantees provide conservative estimate for production under panel degradation over time.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/02/novel-design-for-intermediate-band-solar-cells/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 2, 2023",Novel design for intermediate band solar cells,"An international research team has developed a new intermediate band solar cell (IBSC) design that includes a quantum ratchet (QR) semiconductor nanostructure. This new element reportedly enables storing photoelectrons in a long-lived state, thus enabling efficient optical re-absorption.
Intermediate band solar cells (IBSCs) are believed to have the potential to exceed the Shockley-Queisser limit – the maximum theoretical efficiency that a solar cell with a single p-n junction can reach. It is calculated by examining the amount of electrical energy that is extracted per incident photon.
The devices are commonly designed to provide a large photogenerated current and maintain a high output voltage. They incorporate an energy band that is partly filled with electrons within the bandgap of a semiconductor. In this cell configuration, photons with insufficient energy to push electrons from the valence band to the conduction band utilize this intermediate band to generate an electron-hole pair.
The scientists said that past research demonstrated a QR-IBSC device using a quantum well superlattice (QWSL) at a low temperature.
“This approach involved adding a set of ‘ratchet band' (RB) states, into which the electrons scatter irreversibly, at the cost of a small energy penalty,” they said.
Their new design builds on this cell structure, which is also known as the Vaquero–Stainer Device (VSD). The new High Barrier Device (CHB) design purportedly increases the RB state lifetime and makes cell operation possible at room temperature.
In the proposed cell configuration, an extra 2 nm thick layer of aluminum arsenide (AlAs) films is inserted between the final quantum well of the QWSL and a wide layer made of multiple quantum wells based on aluminum, gallium and arsenide (Al0.3Ga0.7As), which act as the conduction band (CB).
“This AlAs barrier increases the confinement of electrons in the RB, reducing thermal escape,” the academics stated, noting that they used a high-speed double-demodulation two-photon spectroscopy setup to measure two-photon photocurrent (TPP).
They fabricated the cell with an undoped GaAs substrate using molecular beam epitaxy and a buffer layer made of the same material. They also used rings of gold with a thickness of 200 nanometers on 20-nanometer-thick titanium around for the front-side electrical contact and metalized the front of the device with layers of gold and zinc.
They also used a partial etch for the back-side electrical contact, which was then metalized with indium (In) and germanium (Ge) and connected to a gold strip.
“The back-side of the device was polished to a 45-degree chamfer in order to refract the intraband beam which was incident on the back of the device,” said the researchers.
The scientists found that the RB state lifetime in the HBD design is of over 100 s at 12 Kelvin (K), which they said is an improvement by seven orders of magnitude compared to that of the Vaquero-Stainer cell and other VSD designs.
“This led to the successful operation of the device at 300 K, representing significant progress in the field of IBSCs,” they said.
The group presented the new cell design in “Room Temperature Operation of a Quantum Ratchet Intermediate Band Solar Cell,” which was recently published in RRL Solar. It includes scientists from Imperial College London in the United Kingdom and the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia.
“Future generations of the device should now be developed, whose bandgaps better match the solar spectrum, and with designs which improve the efficiency of photon capture and RB-to-CB extraction,” they concluded.

The new model reportedly improves on previous research by including sub-hourly data, rather than monthly average, irradiance figures, and realistic geological constraints on the depth of pumping.
“Considering sub-hourly irradiance time series enables simulations for critical days of the year (notably very low irradiance days) for which the pumped volume may be very low, which can impact smooth water consumption,” the researchers said.
The model produces results for the entire African continent, including North Africa and locations where groundwater is deeper than 50 meters and therefore more appropriate for PVWPS than hand pumps.
The researchers looked at how much groundwater can be pumped by optimally tilted PV systems of 100 W, 1,000 W, and 3,000 W in size, where 1,000 W is the average size of a PVWPS for domestic water access, and 3,000 W for irrigation. The inputted sub-daily irradiance data was for the year 2020.
The results show that the best potential for a 1,000 W PVWPS system is in Central Africa, with an average daily pumped volume of 100 cubic meters.
“Results indicate that the pumped volume values vary importantly from one area to another,” the academics said. “These values have to be compared to the water requirements for domestic use and irrigation.”
The daily water requirement for basic access to domestic water is around 15 liters per person per day, whereas community agriculture requires 10 cubic meters to 100 cubic meters per day. Commercial irrigation often needs more than 200 cubic meters per day.
The larger 3,000 W system notably does not yield higher pumped water volumes in 27% of the locations. This is due to a phenomenon known as “groundwater drawdown,” when the groundwater level drops due to intensive water pumping, reaching the level of the motor pump and thus forcing the system to stop. For example, in the Ivory Coast, the average daily pumped volume for a 1,000 PVWPS system is 15.9 cubic meters and only 5.2 cubic meters for a 3,000 W system.
The results “may help target investments in large-scale PV water pumping programs and identify areas where pumping potential is low and will need additional investigation to de-risk investment,” the academics concluded. They shared their findings in “Aquifer conditions, not irradiance determine the potential of photovoltaic energy for groundwater pumping across Africa,” which was recently published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment.

India installed 1.6 GW of rooftop solar in 2022, down almost 6% year on year, according to Mercom India’s latest market report.
It said that about 42% of installations throughout the year were in the industrial segment. The residential, commercial, and government segments respectively accounted for 32%, 25%, and 1% of the total new capacity additions.
Mercom India said cumulative rooftop solar installations reached almost 8.8 GW as of Dec. 31, 2022. Gujarat topped the installed capacity with a 24% share of cumulative solar rooftop installations, followed by Maharashtra at 14% and Rajasthan at 9%. 
“[The year] was a lost opportunity for the rooftop solar market in India, affected by policy challenges restricting supply and impacting the cost of modules,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. “Despite the hurdles, installations were almost on pace with the previous year. Strong fundamentals continued to drive installations in the commercial and industrial segments. We expect growth to resume in 2023 as pricing and supply challenges moderate.”
The imposition of the basic customs duty (BCD) and the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) mandate for rooftop solar projects added to the volatility in solar module prices and supplies in India.
The next issue of pv magazine, out next Thursday, will focus on the solar manufacturing technology enabling the new era of market expansion and high efficiency modules, including interdigitated back contact (IBC) and perovskite tandem solar cells. The magazine charts the latest technical and investment decisions in the high efficiency solar manufacturing segment and the materials and R&D underpinning them. Reports come in from France, Japan, India, Indonesia, Israel, England, the US, and China and we also examine the troubles of the solar-powered car pioneers.
“Installations may have been higher if project costs hadn’t surged after the BCD and if installers had clarity about grid-connected rooftop solar projects requiring ALMM-enlisted modules,” said Mercom India.
There were 483 MW of rooftop solar additions in the October-December 2022 period. About 56% of that was in the residential segment, while 43% was in the commercial and industrial space, said the research firm.

Adolf Goetzberger, who died on Feb. 24 at the age of 94, was a key figure in the history of German solar research. Goetzberger, an experimental physicist and honorary professor in the Faculty of Physics at the University of Freiburg, founded the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE in 1981. That same year, he developed the idea of agrivoltaics in cooperation with Armin Zastrow.
Goetzberger went to the United States after completing his doctorate in 1955 on the crystallization of vapor-deposited antimony layers. After working with Nobel Prize winner William Shockley, he returned to Germany in 1968 and took over the management of the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics IAF. In 1971, he was appointed honorary professor in the Faculty of Physics at the University of Freiburg.
In 1981, he set up a Fraunhofer IAF working group to form the independent Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE, which he led until 1993.
“I was able to convince the then president of the Fraunhofer Society, but his advisers said that solar energy was impractical,” said Goetzberger on his 80th birthday. That same year, he published an article with Zastrow in Sonnenenergie magazine, “Potatoes under the collector,” to explain the idea of agrovoltaics.
Goetzberger held more than 30 patents and was the president of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Sonnenenergie e.V. (DGS). His contributions to solar energy have been recognized in numerous ways. In 1983, for example, he was the first German to receive the J. J. Ebers Award from the US-based IEEE Electron Devices Society for the development of the silicon field effect transistor. And in 2009, he was given a Lifetime Achievement award by the European Patent Office.
“We bow to Adolf Goetzberger's life's work and are grateful to him for his services to the development of solar energy systems and thus his major contribution to a global energy transition,” said Hans-Martin Henning, one of the two current directors of Fraunhofer ISE.

Since the signing of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), more than 10 companies have announced between 50 GW and 80 GW of solar silicon, wafer, cell and module manufacturing capacity in the United States.
The Solar Energy Industries Association’s (SEIA) roadmap optimistically targets 50 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity. As a result, some analysts see the potential for the USA to emerge as a strong export market for solar panels.
This is hard evidence that just a bit of refined industrial policy – the IRA, in this case – can have a massive impact on local businesses and national security. One new development is the participation of solar developers in solar module assembly factories. Their involvement is motivated by the need to secure module capacity, while meeting the “Made in America” criteria for products. Meeting this criteria is important, because projects that meet the requirement are eligible for the Inflation Reduction Act’s 10% Investment Tax Credit adder.
