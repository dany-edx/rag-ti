With utility scale solar and storage projects stalled in the PJM grid operator’s interconnection queue, “What should be done to get the queue moving?” asked a participant in a recent webinar. The best approach could be public control of PJM and other regional grid operators, said law professor Shelley Welton.
Public control of grid operators is Welton’s preferred solution for fixing interconnection delays and high fees, as well as grid operators’ “heel dragging” on reforming rules to integrate renewables, and their practice of setting new barriers to renewables. Welton noted that California’s grid operator CAISO is publicly governed. In a law journal article, Welton also discussed three other possible improvements to the governance of grid operators, short of public control.
The Clean Energy States Alliance hosted the webinar, to discuss how the 20 “clean energy states,” which have committed to reaching 100% clean energy, can influence grid operators to advance clean energy.
States have many options to exercise influence through existing channels, as described in a report for the 100% Clean Energy Collaborative, which the Alliance supports. Some states have also considered a partial exit, notes the report, as Illinois, New Jersey and Maryland explored options to bypass the PJM capacity market, with its anti-renewables “minimum offer price rule,” in 2020.
Asked on the webinar how clean energy states might prioritize their efforts, between seeking structural reform of grid operators versus influencing them through existing channels, Welton said “part of this is a strategic question about, can you get the leverage you need for the big reforms? Probably the answer depends on FERC’s appetite,” referring to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
“Maybe the best way to do this would be to backchannel with FERC as much as possible,” Welton said, “to understand which commissioners have an appetite for real change. And are they going to support you if you push for it?”
“The dynamics of what else is on their docket, what their priorities are, really matters, for how much states should push for big structural change versus, go along for the ride and try to accomplish some of their substantive goals as best as possible” through existing channels.
As for the clean energy states in the West and Southeast that are outside of a regional grid operator, the report and webinar discussed ongoing initiatives for regional coordination.
Welton’s article, titled “Rethinking Grid Governance for the Climate Change Era,” was praised by Bentham Paulos, author of the collaborative's report, as a “page-turner” relative to other law journal articles. A recording of the webinar is available online.
This article was amended on 19/04/22 to identify Bentham Paulos.

Neoen said its virtual battery is the first of its kind in Australia and is planned to allow large electricity users or retailers to mimic a grid-scale battery without having to build or own one.
The offtake gives AGL Energy the ability to hedge its customer load by virtually charging and discharging a battery of 70 MW at any time over five minutes trading intervals.
Neoen plans to leverage its 100 MW Capital Battery in Canberra to provide the offering, saying the Capital Battery will retain its ability to deliver network services. Construction on Neoen’s 100 MW / 200 MWh Capital Battery began in December 2021 and the battery is expected to start operating in the first half of 2023.
Neoen said the virtual battery solution is “ideally suited” to managing the increasing challenges of the solar “duck curve” which sees oversupply in daylight hours followed by demand peaks in the evenings which challenge energy companies.
“This innovative and flexible offtake is extremely useful for a large electricity user or retailer by conceptually ‘charging’ the battery during low demand periods and ‘discharging’ it during high demand periods,” Neoen said. “This can be scaled to precisely accommodate the size that the customer needs,” it added.
 
The virtual battery capacity will be made available in the New South Wales region of Australia’s National Electricity Market.
“The virtual battery is an ideal firming tool which will become a core Neoen product and a key element in the success of our expanding range of client offerings,” Neoen Australia’s Managing Director Louis de Sambucy said.
“With the Capital Battery currently under construction, we will soon be operating grid-scale batteries in three of the five states of the National Electricity Market and have multiple storage projects in development across Australia.”

(Cemig) – the fourth largest energy company in the country – announced that it will hold another auction for large-scale wind and solar power projects on June 14.
According to the auction announcement, the company will award 10-year and 15-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) to projects exceeding 50 MW in size through this new procurement exercise. No information was provided on the total capacity that will be assigned through the auction.
Cemig will sell electricity from the contracted wind and solar energy facilities to the Brazilian Free Electricity Market (Mercado livre de eletricidade). In this market, the power providers negotiate the conditions of the electricity sale between themselves, or directly with large energy consumers.
During the first auction of this kind, held in June 2018, Cemig contracted 431 MW of solar and wind capacity. In the second procurement exercise, held in early October, the power company contracted another 152 MW for wind and solar power. In a third auction held in 2019, the energy provider contracted 179 MW.
The tender rounds were introduced to replace 2,908 MW of generation capacity which Cemig lost in 2018, when concessions at four Brazilian hydropower plants were renewed and it lost out to international rivals including Engie, Enel and China’s State Power Investment Corporation. The hydropower facilities are in São Simão (with 1.7 GW of generation capacity), Miranda (404 MW), Jaguara (424 MW) and Volta Grande (380 MW).

The two companies also aims to deploy hydrogen-powered hydraulic pumps, auxiliary power units, and mobility solutions. “With our team based in Milan, Italy, and remote support from our US headquarters, Nuvera is poised to serve customers in Europe with fuel cell engines to expand the deployment of high-performance zero-emission vehicles,” the American company wrote earlier this month. Nuvera fuel cell engines are claimed to provide world-class performance for motive platforms in outputs ranging from 5 to 120 kW and higher. The engines are available in two modules, the Nuvera E-45 and E-60 Fuel Cell Engines, which the manufacturer said can power mid- and heavy-duty vehicles such as buses, trucks, port equipment and delivery vans. For high-power applications, multiple engines can be combined.
European aerospace company Airbus and Japan's Kawasaki Heavy Industries have signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly develop a hydrogen-fueled ecosystem. “The scope will include different aspects of the hydrogen supply chain, from the production of hydrogen to its delivery to airports and transfer on-board aircraft,” Airbus wrote on Tuesday.
Wind power specialist Storgrundet Offshore and green hydrogen provider Lhyfe entered into a memorandum of understanding to jointly build a 600 MW hydrogen production plant in Sweden. “The plant is to be built from 2025 onwards in several project phases and will be one of the largest hydrogen production facilities in Europe,” Lhyfe stated, explaining that the production plant will be built in the vicinity of the offshore Storgrundet wind farm, in the industrial area of Söderhamm. The installed capacity of the wind farm is to be expanded to 1 GW in the future. On Tuesday, Lhyfe announced it raised €10 million from Japanese trading and investment conglomerate Mitsui.
Three researchers from Tel Aviv University, and two from the University of Münster presented a strain of microalgae defective in thylakoid proton gradient regulation, whose “unique physiology supports the simplistic, yet robust and scalable, hydrogen production capability.” Microalgae, biocatalysts of hydrogen production, normally require an oxygen-free environment. Normally, the algal hydrogen production is not scalable because it is short-lived due to electron loss to other processes, mainly carbon fixation, the researchers wrote. “Here, we show that a strain defective in thylakoid proton gradient regulation, Δpgr5, bypasses both challenges simultaneously, leading to a prolonged 12-day hydrogen production under ambient mixotrophic conditions in a 1-L setup,” reads an article published in Cell Reports Physical Science. The scientists wrote that Δpgr5 possess a repressed ability to fixate carbon and “that this limitation is counterbalanced by an enhanced chloroplast-mitochondrion energetic exchange.”
Five researchers from South Korea applied a contingent valuation method to examine how much consumers are willing to pay for green hydrogen charging compared to gray hydrogen charging. They found that the monthly mean of willingness to pay per driver is KRW 51,674 ($45.85), equivalent to KRW 4,302 per kg. “Additionally, consumers accept a 28.5% increase in the monthly average fuel expenses when converting to green hydrogen,” the researchers wrote in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. They added that the findings could guide the development of pricing and energy use plans to finance the expansion of green hydrogen infrastructure.
India's renewable energy company Greenko Group, via its subsidiary Greenko ZeroC (GZC), and Belgian mechanical engineering group John Cockerill signed an exclusive agreement to jointly manufacture alkaline electrolyzers in the Indian sub-continent within the next few years. The two companies “will build a hydrogen electrolyzer gigafactory targeting capacity of 2 gigawatts which will substitute 8% of India LNG imports,” the companies wrote on Monday. The gigafactory, which will comprise the full manufacturing electrolyzer value chain, including nickel coating, will produce electrolyzers delivering H2 at 30 bars at the outlet. Last month, the two companies signed a related framework agreement, explaining that the hydrogen would serve the local market. According to Indian reports, the two companies will set up a 50-50 joint venture; the factory could be ready within 18 months. In March, the Indian company signed a memorandum of understanding with Paris-based engineering company Technip Energies to explore green hydrogen development opportunities across industries.
Australia-based Aqua Aerem, the proponent of the 10 GW Desert Bloom Hydrogen project, and Japan's Osaka Gas have entered into a joint development agreement. Desert Bloom Hydrogen would produce renewable hydrogen for domestic and export markets using only off-grid renewable energy. Details of the agreement are confidential, but Osaka Gas will coordinate and help Aqua Aerem in three main fields: project management, hydrogen sales and equipment sourcing. The project consists of a series of modular 2 MW hydrogen production units capable of generating water from the atmosphere, as well as producing heat, renewable electricity, and green hydrogen. The venture, which aims to produce green hydrogen at less than $2/kg within five years, is backed by Sanguine Impact Investment. Sanguine wants to increase the scale of the project to 20 GW.
Countries, especially potential exporters, should improve hydrogen statistics to justify and promote investments in hydrogen. The measures should result from broad cooperation, also intended to standardize and homogenize measurements, said Columbia University‘s Anne-Sophie Corbeau. “Countries could start working together to determine how best to collect hydrogen data, both on the demand and production sides, and include existing consumption as well as potential future consumption in new sectors. Statistics on the demand side need to anticipate new uses in buildings, industry, transport, and power, as well as account for hydrogen's potential use to produce other energy products such as ammonia and methanol,” the French scholar wrote on Monday.
Vancouver-based First Hydrogen has identified four industrial sites in the United Kingdom and is advancing discussions with landowners to secure land rights to develop green hydrogen production projects. It said it would be working with engineering consultants Ove Arup & Partners Limited (ARUP) for engineering studies and designs. “The sites are all in prime industrial areas spread strategically across the North and South of the United Kingdom and will each accommodate both a large refueling station — for light, medium and heavy commercial vehicles with on-site hydrogen production, to serve the urban areas of Greater Liverpool, Greater Manchester, the London area, and the Thames Estuary — and a larger hydrogen production site of between 20 and 40 MW, for a total for the four sites of between 80 MW and 160 MW,” First Hydrogen wrote on Monday. The Canadian company wants to use the production facilities to serve customers of its automotive division. “First Hydrogen's green hydrogen van is to begin demonstrator testing in June with final delivery for road use in September 2022.”

Dutch natural gas infrastructure and transportation company Gasunie, Rotterdam-based bulk products company HES International (HES), and Dutch storage company Vopak have signed a head of terms to jointly develop an import terminal for green ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. “The terminal, that will operate on the Maasvlakte under the name ACE Terminal, will be operational from 2026,” wrote Gasunie on Monday.
On Tuesday, the Port of Rotterdam said that oil and gas major Shell was the first company to sign an agreement to use HyTransPortRTM. “This is the hydrogen pipeline in the port of Rotterdam that Gasunie is laying in collaboration with the Port of Rotterdam Authority from the Maasvlakte to Pernis in order to make the industry in the port more sustainable,” the Port wrote. Holland Hydrogen I, the electrolyzer that Shell plans to build at the Conversion Park on the Maasvlakte, will be connected to the pipeline. The hydrogen will be transported from the conversion park to Pernis via the HyTransPortRTM pipeline, which is expected to be in use by early 2025. 
California-based solutions provider Clean Energy Enterprises (CEE) has executed a strategic cooperation agreement with Norway's capture and mineralization solution company CAPTICO2. The agreement “allows the two companies the ability to promote each partner's technology and develop markets together,” the companies wrote on Tuesday. CEE commercializes waste-to-hydrogen conversion solutions through its subsidiary Ways2H. 
The British Department for Transport (DfT) awarded GBP 1.95 million in funding to 51 innovative transport proposals. “Unitrove Innovation Ltd is being backed to develop a control system for the world's first liquid hydrogen fuel container facility for zero emission ships (as seen in the image above),” the British government wrote on Wednesday.

“These devices are an efficient alternative to thermoelectric generators,” one of the research's corresponding authors, Alejandro Datas, told pv magazine. “So, they could be used in the same kind of applications, like waste heat recovery or power generation in space.”
The team built a small-scale laboratory prototype to test the fundamental operating principles of the technology. “We have demonstrated the capability of producing electricity from the simultaneous radiation of photons and electrons through space,” Datas further explained. “However, the performance is still very poor and much research is still needed to solve some key challenges and reach the performances that are predicted by the theory. Higher efficiency potential makes it possible to conceive their use in new applications like thermal energy storage devices or solar thermal generators.”
Thermoelectric generators have barely exceeded efficiencies of 10% and their main limitation is that not only electrons but also heat is transferred through the device. “This heat transfer is hardly avoidable as there is a solid continuity between the hot and cold sides of the converter, while in hybrid thermionic-photovoltaic converters the solid continuity between the hot and cold sides is broken by a vacuum gap,” Datas emphasized. “This gap is a channel for the flux of photons and electrons, but interrupts the heat propagation, ideally resulting in a negligible thermal conductivity and much higher conversion efficiencies, potentially exceeding 30%.”
Hybrid thermionic-photovoltaic systems are described as an upgraded version of pure thermionic converters, as they add the ability to harvest photons in a photovoltaic anode and produce an additional electrochemical potential that can be delivered as electricity. Moreover, the ability to harvest electrons confers the system with a higher output power capacity than standalone thermophotovoltaic generators, which have already demonstrated efficiencies over 30%.
The system consists of a three-terminal TIPV device made with a tungsten (W) thermionic cathode, a PV/anode structure made of an indium phosphide (n-InP) anode, and a photovoltaic cell based on indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) with an energy bandgap of 0.74 eV. Both thermionic and photogenerated carriers are collected independently through two rear contacts made in the monolithic PV/anode structure. The PV/anode structure is equipped with two independent electrodes developed in the rear surface, one for collecting the electrons and the other for collecting the holes.
“When the cathode is heated at 1,400 C the PV sub-device produces 125.6 mW cm−2, whereas the thermionic sub-device produces 0.35 mW cm−2,” the scientists stressed. “The relatively high work function coatings and the large interelectrode gaps used in this work preclude achieving a high thermionic power contribution.”
The research groups are currently investigating new materials that can emit electrons at relatively low temperatures. “Otherwise, electrons are only emitted at very high temperatures, limiting the number of potential applications,” Datas highlighted. “Another challenge is that very few electrons are emitted far from a hot material and most of them accumulate near its surface. Therefore, solutions must be implemented to collect the electrons only a few microns from the surface. Even smaller distances — of just a few hundred nanometers — must be aimed to collect also the near-field thermal radiation, which are electromagnetic waves that only exist near the surface of a material.”
According to him, different approaches to address these challenges are being investigated, not only in the laboratories of the two research groups but in many others around the world. “Hopefully, this collective effort will result in a set of solutions that can bring this technology closer to market,” Datas concluded.
All the details on the new device can be found in the paper A Three-Terminal Hybrid Thermionic-Photovoltaic Energy Converter, published in Advanced Energy Materials. The same research group recently fabricated a latent heat thermophotovoltaic (LHTPV) battery that is able to store electricity in the form of latent heat at temperatures of over 1,000 C and then convert the stored heat to electricity on demand using a thermophotovoltaic system consisting of a thermal emitter and a photovoltaic diode cell.
