The British government's Clean Maritime Plan aims to at least halve greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by 2050. “Data gathered from bench-testing and sea trials will be utilized for the design and build of similar USVs, as well as for larger uncrewed vessel builds in the near future,” read a statement about the funding award issued on Wednesday. West Sussex-based fuel cell developer Bramble Energy will design and manufacture a marine, customized version of its printed circuit board (PCB) fuel cell. “The use of PCBs, as opposed to metallic or graphite end plates, makes the technology more suited to rugged, marine environments,” added the press statement. InnovateUK and the companies involved claimed the use of a hydrogen fuel source on an USV would be a world first.
Italian electric utility Edison and energy transmission business Snam have signed a memorandum of understanding alongside Italian tech company Saipem and developer Alboran Hydrogen to work on the Puglia Green Hydrogen Valley project, a large scale initiative for the production and transport of green hydrogen in southern Italy. “The Puglia Green Hydrogen Valley project plans to build three green hydrogen production plants, in Brindisi, Taranto and Cerignola (Foggia), for a combined capacity of 220 MW and powered by [the] photovoltaic production of 380 MW in total,” said a press release about the project, published on Tuesday. “Once the three plants are operational, it is forecast that they will be able to produce about 300 million cubic meters of renewable hydrogen every year.” The project partners said their green hydrogen would be used primarily for local industry and would be blended into Snam's local gas network. The authorization process is already under way for the Brindisi project, which will involve PV project-powered electrolyzers with a capacity of 60 MW. “In order to execute the project, the partners anticipate creating a special purpose company ([with ownership divided thus:] Alboran 30%, Edison 30%, Snam 30%, [and] Saipem 10%) following the signing of binding agreements that still have to be negotiated by the parties.”
Indian multinational Tata Steel has announced it wants to adopt hydrogen for its steelworks in IJmuiden, in the Netherlands. In its attempt to reduce CO2 emissions, the company explored two options: carbon capture, usage and storage technology and hydrogen. “Today, Tata Steel has announced it will pursue the hydrogen route in IJmuiden, and undertake a detailed assessment in this regard,” the company announced on Wednesday. “This involves the introduction of direct reduced iron (DRI) technology, which can make iron using natural gas or hydrogen before it is converted to steel in one or more electric furnaces to be invested [in] in the future.” Tata said it will consult stakeholders to further develop the hydrogen option. “The decarbonization pathway in IJmuiden will also help us chart the future transition roadmap of Tata Steel’s other integrated steelmaking sites,” said TV Narendran, CEO and managing director of Tata Steel, and chairman of the supervisory board of Tata Steel Netherlands. Earlier this summer, Swedish raw material-to-steel company SSAB announced it had manufactured and delivered the ‘world's first fossil-free steel.' SSAB said it used HYBRIT technology developed by the joint venture it formed with Swedish state-owned miner Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag and public power company Vattenfall. HYBRIT is raising interest among several companies and governments, including those of South Korea and India.
German hydrogen specialist Enapter this week celebrated the groundbreaking of its €105 million mass-production facilities for green hydrogen electrolyzers at its 82,000m2 campus in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. “Enapter is pursuing an initial goal of multiplying its production capacity to 10,000 electrolysers [per] month to satisfy the rapidly-growing demand for low-cost hydrogen-production solutions,” the company said on Tuesday. The development of the machinery necessary was supported by the North Rhine-Westphalia Ministry of Economic Affairs, Innovation, Digitalisation and Energy, with around €9.36 million. “From 2022, Enapter will offer the first megawatt-scale AEM Electrolyser – the containerized AEM Multicore – featuring 420 of its AEM electrolysis stacks,” added an Enaper press release. The company said its electrolyzers are used in 33 countries.
The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) British energy giant BP, and Abu Dhabi-based, state-owned renewables company Masdar have signed a strategic framework agreement to expand energy and climate collaboration between the UAE and U.K., including the potential development of hydrogen hubs in both nations at a scale of at least 2 GW. “Under the terms of the agreements, ADNOC, BP and Masdar will seek to collaborate on U.K. and UAE clean hydrogen hub development at an initial scale of 1 GW in the UAE and 1 GW in the U.K., building on the UAE’s position as an anchor investor in some of the U.K.’s largest offshore wind projects,” the partners said today. ADNOC and BP will also team up to develop greenfield carbon capture and underground storage facilities.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has awarded up to AUS$2.17 million (€1.35 million) to energy company Stanwell to complete a feasibility study for a hydrogen export project in Gladstone, Queensland. “The study, delivered in partnership with Japan’s largest hydrogen supplier, Iwatani Corporation, will investigate the feasibility of developing a hydrogen production facility capable of producing up to 36,500 tons per annum of renewable hydrogen and export[ing] to Japan from 2026,” stated a press release about the project. “Stanwell and Iwatani’s long term plan is to scale up to 328,500 tons per annum in 2031, to meet forecast Japanese demand. Stanwell proposes to ship hydrogen in liquid form, utilizing liquid hydrogen shipping vessels.” The AU$10.4 million (€6.4 million) study is also supported by Osaka-based municipal utility Kansai Electric Power Corporation; Japanese private businesses Marubeni Corporation and Kawasaki Heavy Industries; Australian energy business APA Group; and the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

The RMB19.6 billion (US$3.04 billion) scheme includes 3 GW of photovoltaic generation capacity and 300 MW of CSP plus 520 MW of energy storage. No megawatt-hours storage figure was provided by the Golmud City announcement for the storage element of the project. The renewables field is scheduled for completion in 2025 and is part of China's 14th five-year plan.
The National Energy Administration today said it had registered 1.85 GW of new distributed generation PV systems last month, to bring this year's eight-month total to 9.52 GW. Shandong, Hebei, and Henan provinces took the top three positions, with figures of 678 MW, 432 MW, and 237 MW, respectively, in August.
The chilling effect of rising polysilicon and solar panel costs on project development in China was spelled out today in first-half figures published by state-owned PV manufacturer and renewables developer China Shuifa Singyes Energy. ‘SFSY’ said it added only 8.2 MW of grid-connected solar generation capacity in the first six months of the year and blamed the polysilicon price. The project development business of the company generated revenue of just RMB59.4 million (US$9.21 million), down from RMB481 million (US$74.6 million) a year earlier, for gross profit of RMB15.2 million (US$2.36 million), down from RMB48 million. Sales of PV and solar thermal products rose 111% to book revenue of RMB34.2 million in the first half, up from 16.2 million year on year, but still posted a loss of RMB4.9 million, because of material costs, after recording a RMB300,000 (US$46,500) profit 12 months earlier. That meant the group – which must repay state-owned construction business parent Shuifa RMB1.21 billion (US$188 million) this year – was again reliant on the fossil fuel-fired steam business it acquired from Shuifa last year, which generated six-month revenue of RMB139 million (US$21.6 million) for a gross profit of RMB37.7 million (US$5.85 million), up from RMB31.4 million (US$4.87 million) a year earlier. Total profit came in at RMB104 million (US$16.1 million), down from RMB241 million, and SFSY has RMB10 million (US$1.55 million) of its cash tied up by a court owing to a product quality dispute with a customer which is pending appeals lodged by both parties in July.
Inverter maker Sungrow reported revenue of RMB8.21 billion (US$1.26 billion) in the first half, to book year-on-year growth of 18.27%. Net profit was RMB757 million (US$117 million), up 69.68% from the same period a year earlier. Sungrow added, its January-to-June inverter shipments totaled 182 GW.

The installation may be one of two projects tendered by the state-owned Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand in June 2019, to be installed at the Sirindhorn dam at the site of a 12 MW hydropower plant on the Lam Dom Noi river, although a press release issued by Sungrow yesterday did not give a precise location.
The utility said at the time of the tender, it expected to pay THB1.86 billion ($56.2 million) for the facility.
Sungrow said it supplied its SG3400HV solar inverter as well as the “floating PV system solution, including the floating body,” for the 121ha installation on a dam, which was connected this month.
Sungrow said it has already installed a 12.5 MW floating array in the Rayong province of Thailand, plus four systems with a total generation capacity of 15 MW in Suphanburi province.

Three projects are planned to be located at the coal power plants SE Rovinari, SE Turceni, and SE Ișalnița and five more plants are expected to be built at the coal mining sites Tismana, Tismana 2, Pinoasa, Bohorel, and Rovinari Est.
These solar parks are being developed to replace the coal power capacity that the company wants to decommission by 2026, when its total capacity should reach 3.09 GW, from 3.24 GW currently. In March 2020, CE Oltenia issued a tender to seek consultants for four of the eight projects. 
The European Commission is supporting the company's decarbonization plan with a RON1.2 billion ($281.7 million) loan. CE Oltenia’s coal power complex consists of 12 generation units with a combined capacity of 3.24 GW.
Currently, there are other large scale PV projects under development after the government introduced more favorable rules for power purchase agreements, in May 2020.
These include, among others, a 111 MW solar park being developed by the OMV Petrom energy supplier majority-owned by Austrian business OMV, a 700 MW project that is set to be spread across the municipalities of Grăniceri and Pilu, and another one under development by CE Oltenia, which wants to deploy 310 MW at one of its coal power facilities.

Through the Whole-Home Heat Pump pilot program, the research center offered existing homes that switched from gas, or new and rebuilt homes with no fossil fuel appliances, a flat incentive of $2,500 per home to install a whole-home system, which it claims eliminates the need to maintain fossil fuel pipes or tanks and a second heating system.
The pilot program also provided higher incentives for lower-income customers and, at its final stage, included other efficiency or electrification measures as part of the heat pump project. Overall, funds were awarded to 68 whole-home heat pump projects, of which 31 were new construction projects and 137 retrofit projects, with a total of 39 installers participating in the pilot.
“The primary lesson learned is that whole-home heat pumps are a feasible solution, not only for new construction but also for retrofitting existing buildings, including older homes,” the MassCEC said. “We surveyed pilot customers six months after project completion and 95% of respondents were somewhat, or fully satisfied with the level of comfort for heating, while all were somewhat, or fully satisfied with the level of comfort for cooling.”
The institute's experts, however, found that heat pump project costs were higher than expected, at $18,400 per system, with projects being less expensive in new homes than in retrofits, which they explained by the smaller loads of new constructions and the smaller size of the required heat pumps.
In new homes, the average cost was around $14,000, and in existing buildings and retrofits, $20,000. “Of the retrofit projects in our pilot, 25% required an electric service upgrade while 38% reported that their natural gas heating system also provided their domestic hot water, which meant that homeowners either had to leave their natural gas boiler in place just to heat their hot water or else buy a new hot water heater as part of the project,” they further explained.
Several case studies were analyzed by the research institute and information was constantly collected from homeowners and contractors. “Our hope is that costs for whole-home heat pumps projects will go down as installers become more comfortable with the capabilities of heat pumps and manufacturers offer more options,” the experts stated, noting that pubic incentives will still be necessary to drive demand and reduce production and installation costs.
According to a recent study from the University of Maryland, College Park; the University of Rhode Island; and Carnegie Mellon University, installing an air source heat pump may increase a home’s value by up to 7.1% in 23 states of the United States. The price premium is estimated at between $10,400 and $17,000 per transaction, and the average cost for installing an air source heat pump was estimated by that study to be around $8,000.

State-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) today announced it has commissioned India’s largest floating solar plant. The 25 MW project, occupying a water surface area of 100 acres, is located at NTPC's Simhadri thermal power station in Andhra Pradesh.
Besides producing clean power, the project will also reduce water evaporation by shading the water. It will offer a higher energy yield than conventional, ground-mounted solar projects, due to the cooling effect of the water on the panels.
BHEL said it designed an innovative floating array to meet the unique requirement of anchoring the support structures without touching or loading either the reservoir floor or the retaining wall ‘bund.' The module array was designed—for the first time in India—to withstand gusts of wind of up to 180km/h. Corrosion-resistant platform structures and other equipment were used due to the coastal location of the project.
Bharat's scope of work in the project included design as well as engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) of the solar array. The project was executed by BHEL’s recently formed Solar Business division.
The installer offers EPC services for solar projects including ground-mounted, rooftop, floating, and canal top installations. The company said it has an Indian solar EPC portfolio of more than 1.2 GW and claims the nation’s largest portfolio of floating solar, with more than 45 MW commissioned and 107 MW or so under execution. BHEL also manufactures space-grade solar panels, and batteries for space applications.

The French PV project developer TSE and the German developer Enerparc have officially inaugurated France's second-largest PV plant, in Marville, in the Meuse department.
Built on 155 hectares on a former NATO military airport used by the Canadian Air Force from 1955 to 1967, and bought in 2006 by the Communauté de communes du Pays de Montmédy, the facility relies on 364,000 PV modules, some of which are bifacial, the company said. With a total installed capacity of 152 MW, it is able to generate around 160 GWh/year, which is the equivalent of 90% of the annual consumption of the city of Verdun, which is located nearby.
The commissioning took place gradually: TSE's western half of the plant was commissioned in May 2021 and Enerparc's eastern half was commissioned at the beginning of September 2021.
TSE's investment in the project amounted to €65 million in financing, including €57 million of debt and the rest financed in equity by shareholders. “The plant will allow a very high production of electricity, even when there is the slightest sunshine,” said Pierre-Yves Lambert, CEO of TSE. “This is a successful conversion that takes into account existing activities such as the aerodrome, biodiversity and agricultural activity.”
Over a period of 30 years, the two partners will conduct a program for the preservation and redeployment of biodiversity through three types of action: the deartificialisation of soils, the restoration of a mosaic of grasslands, and the limitation of invasive plant species. All of these actions, which are voluntary measures not resulting from any obligation, were defined in partnership with CDC Biodiversité, a subsidiary of French financial institution Caisse des Dépôts.
In addition, they have given the management of the grassy areas to a young, local, organic sheep farmer who will provide eco-grazing with a herd of around 1,000 sheep.
France's largest solar power plant is currently the 300 MW Cestas project. Built by French renewable energy developer Neoen in 2015, the facility is located in the homonymous municipality in the Gironde department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine, in southwestern France.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/17/thai-solar-ceo-goes-huawei-at-home/,"SPONSORED,ASIA",,"SEPTEMBER 17, 2021",Thai solar CEO goes Huawei at home,"In the time Cathleen Maleenont has been at the helm of Thai Solar Energy (TSE), the company has been named among Asia’s Best Performing Companies in the Asia Corporate Excellence and Sustainability Awards and has secured some of the most notable utility-scale solar PV projects in the region. In her decade at the company, including the last seven years as chief executive officer and chair, Maleenont has also managed to carve out a foothold for Thai Solar Energy in Japan, one of East Asia’s most significant renewable energy markets.
Image: Thai Solar Energy
TSE is currently constructing what will be the country’s largest solar park, the Onikoube Solar Power Plant. The project is being built on a 156-hectare former golf course in the city of Osaki, in northeastern Japan’s Miyagi prefecture. The CNY 35.5 billion ($320 million) project will have a generation capacity of 147 MW once it goes online in 2023. Owned by PurpleSol, an affiliate of Thai Solar Energy, the solar park has been designed so the 362,960 solar panels it features can accommodate the sloping terrain and snowfall in the area.
TSE has selected Huawei as its technology partner for the ambitious project. In 2019, they entered into an agreement with each other under which Huawei will supply its 1500V Smart PV Solution with Smart I-V Curve Diagnosis. Combined with Huawei’s AI algorithm, the solution will optimize the Onikoube Solar Power Plant’s operation and maintenance efficiency and reduce its operating costs. Thai Solar Energy partnered with Huawei on this “mega” project after the two companies successfully collaborated on a pilot array in July 2014.
Maleenont said that TSE selects its technology partners based on three metrics. The first, naturally, is quality, with Maleenont saying that the company chooses only “state of the art technology.” Reliability is also crucial, with a key component of that including “brand name and customer acceptance.” Lastly, the technology must be reasonably priced. Evidently, Thai Solar Energy found that Huawei’s Smart PV Solutions fulfilled all these benchmarks.
After a decade developing utility-scale solar farms in Thailand and more than seven years in Japan, Maleenont said the main differences in the two markets involve rules and regulations, rather than product preferences. “The economic terms versus the efficiency of products used are currently competitive, therefore operators like TSE have choices in selecting the best products at the best economic return,” Maleenont said.
Thai Solar Energy’s portfolio today comprises 41 renewable energy projects with a total combined capacity of 300 MW. This includes 15 utility-scale solar farm projects in Thailand and eight in Japan. In May, The Bangkok Post reported that Thai Solar Energy is also in the process of acquiring two new renewable assets. These installations will add a further 50 MW to its portfolio, as the company targets increasing its capacity by up to 200 MW in the next three to five years.
While Thai Solar Energy specializes in utility-scale solar, it has also installed more than 10 MW of rooftop solar. “[Rooftop solar] is getting more popular due to the lower cost of investment and higher efficiency of the equipment installed,” Maleenont said. Thai Solar Energy currently has 14 commercial rooftop solar projects installed in Thailand.
Taking work home
This year, Maleenont herself installed rooftop solar on her own home. For that project she again selected Huawei technology, installing its 10 kW three-phase string inverter and Luna2000 battery at its maximum 30 kWh capacity. Those Huawei systems will control and store the solar energy harvested by the 24 PERC monofacial 530 Wp solar panels now installed on Maleenont’s roof.
Maleenont noted that Huawei’s Smart PV Residential Solution also gives her the opportunity to see her solar generation, battery charge and discharge status via its mobile monitoring system. Through the system, she is also able to view load consumption and calculate her percentage of self-consumption.
Like many households with solar, Maleenont said she chose to install her system to both save energy and reduce her carbon emissions. “It’s the business I’m in for over a decade … I do have a passion for it,” she added.
The CEO said she had selected Huawei for her home as it is “one of the forefront providers” in the residential solar segment and because of the credibility it established through its work with Thai Solar Energy.

The manufacturer said the power system can receive a solar input of 2.4 kW and is able to provide a seamless, uninterrupted power supply during power outages.
The solution consists of the company's AC300 power station, with a capacity of 6 kW, that can be linked to Bluetti's own portable solar modules, and a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery module, called the B300, with a storage capacity of 3.072 kWh.
“Bluetti AC300 is 100% modular and can accept up to four B300 battery modules per unit, adding up to a total of 12.288 kWh,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “While connected to two B300 battery modules, the AC300 can be charged with both solar and AC simultaneously, adding up to 5,400 W of power input.”
The AC300 unit weighs in at 21.6kg and comes with a 3 kW pure sine wave inverter which the manufacturer said is able to adjust the AC charging rate with no need for a power brick. It relies on a dual-core controller which combines digital and analog signals to control the MPPT module, the inverter and the DC-to-DC module. The system can be controlled through a specific application, via either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. 
According to Bluetti, the proposed solution operates at 35 decibels. By comparison, the sound produced by a typical washing machine is 70 decibels, the company added. Furthermore, Bluetti said the device requires minimal maintenance as it has not many moving parts, unlike fossil fuel generators. The AC300 paired with one B300 battery module costs $2,899, and a system with two B300s retails for $3,648.

Built with newly developed shingle interconnection technology, the panel has an average power of 315.64 W and a relative standard variation of 0.34%, which shows that the device has remarkable reproducibility for the manufacturing and characterization methods used.
The heterojunction cells were cut into six strips and the module was assembled without any metal ribbon welded to the cells or gaps between the cells, thus increasing its active surface.
When the module was equipped with a non-blocking UV encapsulant, it achieved an output of 322.64 W, which helped improve its power yield by around 2%.
“The average efficiency is 21.41% (active area) for modules with non-blocking UV encapsulant, and 20.95% for the others. On the total surface area, the module efficiency is 19.5%,” the French research group explained. “The module weighs 19.6kg, i.e. a surface weight of 11.8kg/m², a gain of about one third compared to a standard module (about 18kg/m²).”
The research institute said the module is one of the top five most performant heterojunction solar modules, in terms of power density, with the champion panel achieving 214.15 W/m² and the average device 209.5 W/m².
The scientists tested different module architectures under IEC 61215 conditions to establish a reliable manufacturing process and bill of material. “A first semi-industrial manufacturing campaign has just been completed and resulted in the production of 10 shingled HJT modules, of approximately 320 W, for an equivalent size of 60 cells, designed to meet the needs of building applied PV (BAPV) applications, in terms of weight reduction, high area performance, and aesthetics,” they concluded.
CEA-INES and Enel Green Power, the renewables unit of Italian utility Enel, achieved, in August 2020, an efficiency of 25.0% for a heterojunction solar cell with an active surface of 213cm2, based on the M2 silicon wafer format. The French research institute had also achieved 24.25% peak efficiency for a silicon heterojunction solar cell in December 2019.

Solar panel waste may reach the weight of 30 Empire State Buildings, or 10 million metric tons, by 2050, said the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
As a result, interest is growing in minimizing and maximizing the value of PV materials through the creation of a circular economy for energy materials.
NREL said most research thus far has been directed toward developing methods to technically and economically reuse solar materials, but does not consider how social behaviors fit into the picture. Analysts said the consideration of consumer behavior and awareness can allow consumers to become part of the solution, and can accelerate the adoption of circular economy approaches.

The analysts applied agent-based modeling, which represents customer groups as “agents,” or independent decision-making entities that are trained based on data to simulate decisions made on behalf of the groups they represent.
Four agents were modeled: PV owners, installers, recyclers, and manufacturers. Agents selected from the options of repair, reuse, recycle, landfill, or store an aging PV module under different scenarios, like varying recycling policies or costs.
The model used agent decisions to calculate PV mass avoided, as well as the economic impact like costs for manufacturers or net revenue for recyclers and installers. It also factored in the learning effect for recycling, a decrease in costs due to scale and technology advancement.
The model found that in today’s conditions, few incentives exist to encourage recycling. Based on a projection of 500 GW installed in the U.S. by 2050, 9.1 million metric tons of waste would be produced. The analysts modeled a current average recycling cost of $28 per module, repairs at $65 per module, and landfills at only $1.38 per module. Used modules could be sold at 36% of new module prices. 
Based on those figures, the model estimated that over the next 30 years, 80% of modules will be landfilled, 1% reused, and 10% recycled.  
At today’s material recovery rate, the total recycled mass would be around 8%. The analysts said with today’s technology, PV modules aren’t easy to separate, and mostly low-value materials are extracted. As a result, there isn’t enough revenue to incentivize more recycling. 
The NREL model showed that a reduced recycling cost would add a significant boost in adoption. Lowering the cost per module from $28 to $18, for example, could potentially lead to an increase in the recycling rate by more than one-third by 2050. 
The study also said that social influence can have an impact on recycling. For example, early adopters who have a generally positive outlook on the practice can pave the way. This can cause a virtuous cycle, where consumers not only can influence those around them, but also drive down recycling costs by helping the recycling industry to grow. 
Higher material recovery rates also would drive adoption. New processes that recover high value materials like silver, copper, and silicon for reuse could create a recycler cumulative net income of $1.3 billion by 2050, said NREL.
