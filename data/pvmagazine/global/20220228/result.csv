“The solar power plants are still intact and can be operated remotely, but none are currently delivering power due to curtailment instructions issued by the grid operator,” the company said in a press release. “Scatec is monitoring the situation and is ready to deliver power when requested by the Ukrainian authorities, but it is currently uncertain when delivery can be resumed.”
The company added it is currently seeking to assist its 66 employees in the country by offering transportation, accommodation and other immediate support. “We are deeply concerned over the situation we see unfold in Ukraine. We are doing everything we can to ensure the safety of Scatec’s employees and this remains our top priority in the days and weeks to come”, said Scatec CEO Raymond Carlsen.
Scatec's solar plants in Ukraine are mostly located in central and southern Ukraine and were built under a feed-in tariff scheme that expired in 2020. “In 2021, 6% of Scatec’s power production revenues were generated in Ukraine,” the company stated.

In the proposed system configuration, the heat produced by the photovoltaic panel is recovered via a thermally insulated helical coil heat exchanger and used to heat the water. A south-oriented system with a tilt angle of six degrees was built with monocrystalline solar modules from Canadian Solar (305W), Trinasolar (305W), and Felicity Solar (250W).
The installation also utilizes a solenoid valve to allow water recirculation when the temperature below the PV module rises significantly. “The temperature below the modules and the system, is managed by a microcontroller that switches the different interfaces and two knobs that allow the adjustment of different temperature ranges,” the scientists explained, noting that the solenoid valve is turned on and the cold water circulates through the coil, passing via a water trap when the module temperature exceeds 59 degrees Celsius. The heat exchanger below the panel was thermally insulated with polyurethane foam and an aluminum sheet behind the insulation.
The system was tested on the second level of the building housing the local company Solaring, under the climatic conditions of the city of Bafoussam, in the western region of Cameroon. Temperature sensors were used to measure the various temperatures of the hybrid system as well as the water temperature at the outlet of the exchanger. Current and voltage sensors were used to assess the performance of the PV modules. The measurements were taken over four days at intervals of five minutes.
The scientists found that the PV/T system with the modules from Canadian Solar obtained the best overall efficiency, at 57.59%. With average irradiation of 877W/m2, these modules achieved an average power conversion efficiency of 16.8%, an average water thermal photovoltaic electric efficiency of 18.89%, a 12.3% growth in power yield, an average water thermal photovoltaic thermal efficiency of 38.7%, and an average hot water temperature of 41 degrees Celsius.
For comparison, the module from Trina achieved an average power conversion efficiency of 16.0%, an average water thermal photovoltaic electric efficiency of 18.42%, an 11.8% growth in power yield, an average water thermal photovoltaic thermal efficiency of 39.1%, and an average hot water temperature of 41.5 degrees Celsius.
The panel from Felicity Solar achieved the poorest performance, with an average power conversion efficiency of 15.8%, an average water thermal photovoltaic electric efficiency of 17.02%, an 11.0% growth in power yield, an average water thermal photovoltaic thermal efficiency of 38.7%, and an average hot water temperature of 41 degrees Celsius.
“This approach allowed us to recover some of the electrical power of the modules lost as heat while determining the amount of hot water that can be produced by a PV module,” the scientists concluded. “The prototype [that was] realized and experimented [on] also allowed us to note that the electrical performances of PV/T water systems also vary according to the type and brand of solar module chosen.”
The results of the tests can be found in the paper “Experimental study on the electrical and thermal characteristics of a hybrid photovoltaic/thermal water solar collector model using photovoltaic solar modules of different brands,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management: X.

Belgium installed around 850MW of new PV systems last year, according to new figures released by the Belgian association Energie Commune, which was formerly known as Association belge pour la Promotion des Energies Renouvelables (APERe).
For comparison, the newly installed PV capacities for 2020, 2019, and 2018, were 1,010MW, 544MW, and 367MW, respectively.
With last year's new additions, Belgium reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of over 7GW.
According to Belgian grid operator Elia, solar was able to produce more than 7TWh of power last year, thus covering about 8% of total electricity consumption in Belgium, which in 2021 reached 85 TWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/28/solid-state-lithium-ion-battery-with-capacity-retention-of-over-4mah-sq-cm/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CANADA,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 28, 2022",Solid-state lithium-ion battery with capacity retention of over 4mAh/sq cm,"A group of researchers from the University of Waterloo, in Canada, has developed a new solid electrolyte which has demonstrated stable high-voltage operation with capacity retention of more than 4mAh/cm2. This electrolyte, composed of lithium, scandium, indium and chlorine, conducts lithium ions well but electrons poorly, preventing decomposition at high voltages.
With such an electrolyte, an all-solid-state battery can function without significantly losing capacity for more than 100 cycles at high voltage (above 4V) and for 1,000 of cycles at intermediate voltage. According to the researchers, the chloride nature of the electrolyte is the key to the device's stability at operating conditions above 4V.
“Chloride electrolytes have become increasingly attractive because they oxidize only at high voltages and some are chemically compatible with the best cathodes we have,” said Linda Nazar, a distinguished research professor of chemistry at the University of Waterloo and a member of the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory. “There’s been a few of them reported recently, but we designed one with distinct advantages,” she added.
Current iterations of solid-state electrolytes focus heavily on sulfides, which oxidize and degrade above 2.5V. They therefore require the incorporation of an insulating coating around the cathode material that operates above 4V, which impairs the ability of electrons and lithium ions to move from the electrolyte into the cathode. “With sulfide electrolytes you have a kind of conundrum — you want to electronically isolate the electrolyte from the cathode so it doesn’t oxidize but you still require electronic conductivity in the cathode material,” Nazar said.
While not the first group to design a chloride electrolyte, Nazar and her colleagues made the novel decision to swap out half the indium for scandium, which proved to be the winning recipe for lower electronic – and higher ionic – conductivity.
One chemical key to the ionic conductivity lay in the material’s crisscrossing 3D structure, called a spinel. The researchers' goal was to load the spinel with as many charge-carrying ions as possible but also to leave sites open for the ions to move through. “You might think of it like trying to a host a dance,” said Nazar, “you want people to come but you don’t want it to be too crowded.”
The professor said it is not yet clear why the device's electronic conductivity is lower than many previously reported chloride electrolytes but it helps establish a clean interface between the cathode material and solid electrolyte, a fact largely responsible for the stable performance even with high amounts of active material in the cathode.
The findings were published in the paper “High areal capacity, long cycle life 4 V ceramic all-solid-state Li-ion batteries enabled by chloride solid electrolytes,” in the journal Nature Energy. The research was funded by the DOE units the Office of Science and the Office of Basic Energy Sciences, with support from Canada’s National Sciences and Engineering Research Council.

While the board pursued an expansionist approach which has reaped bountiful returns from the company's glassmaking and solar project development units – and is preparing to enter the profitable polysilicon manufacturing game – the rising input costs and falling price of the glass used in PV modules last year caused less of a headache than expected thanks to international currency movements.
Unveiling a set of figures this morning which amounted to a shareholder net profit of HK$4.92 billion (US$630 million), the Chinese glassmaker said appreciation of the renminbi currency and Malaysian ringgit against the Hong Kong dollar last year “fully offset the impact of the decrease in average selling price” for solar panel glass.
Those higher input costs for the manufacturer amounted to Xinyi's raw materials bill almost doubling, from HK$4.8 billion (US$615 million) in a bumper 2020 to HK$8.12 billion (US$1.04 billion) last year. Throw in transport costs, including “container shortages and port congestion,” which rose from HK$290 million (US$37.1 million) to HK$493 million, year on year, and investors were told the manufacturer expects some of its peers to pause or abandon production capacity expansion plans.
Not Xinyi, though, which said it added four 1,000-ton-per-day melting-capacity production lines last year and plans to add another eight this year – three of them by the end of June – as well as reactivating two 900-ton lines which have been undergoing repairs, also before July. At an unspecified later point, and depending on the market situation, Xinyi then plans to roll out a further eight 1,000-ton lines and two 1,200-ton fabs.
Solar panel glass sales supplied HK$13 billion (US$1.66 billion) of the company's total revenue of HK$16.1 billion (US$2.06 billion) last year – up from HK$9.99 billion (US$1.28 billion) and HK$12.3 billion (US$1.58 billion), respectively, a year earlier – as the business banked gross profit of HK$7.55 billion (US$967 million, up from HK$6.58 billion/US$843 million) and a net profit of HK$5.58 billion (US$715 million, from HK$5.02 billion/US$643 million), of which HK$4.92 billion is accredited to non-controlling shareholders. The latter will see a dividend return of HK$0.10 (US$0.01) per share as a result, provided shareholders approve the payout at Xinyi's annual general meeting on June 2.
On the smaller solar project development side of the business, sales of electricity drove revenue of HK$1.45 billion (US$186 million), up from HK$977 million (US$125 million) a year earlier, with tariff adjustments generating HK$1.39 billion (up from HK$1.25 billion) and engineering, procurement and construction activity drumming up HK$134 million (US$17.2 million), up from HK$92.7 million (US$11.9 million) in 2020. Xinyi said it is owed HK$5.07 billion (US$649 million) in overdue subsidy payments for its solar projects.
While Xinyi said some solar projects had been pushed back into this year so developers could assess energy storage requirements mandated by the authorities, the company said it constructed four solar farms with a total generation capacity of 440MW last year and bought two projects to add a further 140MW to its portfolio.
The development business, which donated 16MW of small scale distributed generation (DG) arrays for charitable causes last year – at a cost of HK$65.3 million (US$8.36 million) – intends to add another 720MW of solar generation capacity this year, according to today's update to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The company also noted the rising importance of DG solar arrays in China, following the policy launched by the National Energy Administration in June which prompted 676 counties across 31 provinces to sign up to be pilot areas. Under the terms of the initiative, government buildings in those counties must cover at least half their roofspace with solar panels, schools and hospitals must cover at least 40%, commercial and industrial roofs 30%-plus, and rural households at least 20%.
With its solar glass and project development businesses apparently flying, Xinyi is gearing up to enter polysilicon production with a factory in Qujing, in Yunnan province, which will be developed via a joint venture which will be 52% owned by Xinyi Solar and 48% by the connected Xinyi Glass business, which is controlled by the same shareholders.

The program will investigate the operating and safety profile of Redflow’s redox flow batteries, their cycle life and aging properties, and will seek to understand how the batteries behave under “off-nominal” conditions of overcharge, over-discharge, and external short-circuits.
The research aims to enhance the knowledge base around the operating and safety characteristics of zinc-bromine flow batteries, enabling interested parties to better understand and compare a broad range of product chemistries.
Six Redflow batteries, bought by Underwriters Laboratories (UL), arrived at an SES facility in Texas in December. The test program started last month.
“As redox flow battery technology evolves, it’s important to determine its safety and performance limits under various conditions,” said Judy Jeevarajan, vice president and executive director of the Electrochemical Safety Research Institute at UL. “Our partnership with Redflow and SES will deepen our understanding of this energy storage alternative.”
Marketed as ZCell and ZBM2 products, Redflow’s 10kWh zinc-bromine flow batteries are designed for deep cycling, long duration stationary storage applications and can tolerate harsh conditions. The two models are the world’s smallest commercially available flow batteries and are scalable from a single system installation through to grid scale deployments.
Last year, Brisbane-based Redflow put the finishing touches to its latest model, the Gen3. The new product has several design changes from the previous two systems, such as a side-by-side tank design and a single, rather than double stack – both of which are expected to reduce production costs, according to the manufacturer.
“With Gen3 we are confident of achieving a 30% reduction in manufacturing costs through supply chain and engineering productivity impacts,” Redflow CEO and managing director Tim Harris said in a statement announcing customer trials of the product 13 months ago.
In an Australian Stock Exchange announcement today, Redflow said it achieved a 172% jump in revenue from July to December. The company said it generated AU$1.2 million (US$867,000) in the six month window and rolled out 2GWh of its zinc-bromine batteries to customers across the United States, South Africa, and Australia.
The manufacturer said its Gen3 ZBM battery remains on track to be introduced into production in the April-to-June period and reported a growing pipeline, including interest in megawatt-hour scale systems.
Over the half-year period, Redflow also completed a 2MWh project in California for Anaergia’s Rialto Bioenergy Facility, its largest single deployment to date. Touted as a significant milestone for the Australian manufacturer, the project is said to provide a “high level of exposure to the US, growing network and global markets”.
“The Anaergia project has generated significant interest in the Redflow solution by US and global corporations and governments, notably by a large US listed corporate who in June named Redflow in a request for information as an approved supplier of flow batteries,” Redflow said today.

Called HP+, the coating is claimed to increase power yield by between 4 and 7% compared to non-coated modules, over a period of up to five years. “Its cost is estimated at around €1.60 per module and application costs [are] approximately €0.10,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “But application costs may vary depending on local labor market conditions.”
The coating is currently being produced at different facilities in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The coating process involves four nanomaterials. Three compounds called NanoClean, Vetra clean, and Vtranova are used for preparing the glass surface for the deposition of a fourth material, which is called HydroPlus and creates a 120nm thick coating layer on the glass surface. This final element plays a key role in giving the panel anti-soiling, anti-abrasion, self-cleaning, and anti-reflection properties.
The coating can be applied to the modules via a spray process by a specialized installer or a robot, onto PV systems that are at least two years old. The coating kits can be used by Rads' partner companies and the robot can be supplied by Rads in the future. “We developed a prototype robot for coating in collaboration with the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) and the design is under [an] iterative process for testing and deployment,” the spokesperson added.
According to the manufacturer, the cost of the coating has a payback time of 2.5 to four years, depending on the dust level of the site. “More dust and pollution at the site will lead to a shorter payback period,” the spokesperson specified. “The main cost is for nanomaterials and we already produce material in quantities which are good enough to have shorter payback times.”
The coating has already shown extremely good results in real field conditions, according to the company. It was already tested across 10 unspecified sites in Europe, Africa, India and the USA.

Germany’s federal network agency, the Bundesnetzagentur, has reported that 420MW of new PV was installed in the country in January.
For comparison, the newly installed PV capacity for January 2021 was 536MW, and in December 2021 it was 421MW.
The cumulative capacity of all PV systems in Germany reached 56.7GW at the end of January.
The main market driver remains the segment for PV systems not exceeding 300kW in size under the country's feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme, for which around 216.4MW was installed. PV installations with a capacity of between 300 and 750kW, for which developers can opt between a lower FIT or the auction scheme, totaled only 12.7MW in January.
As a result of the strong growth registered in the past months, all the FITs for PV installations will be reduced by another 1.4% and will range from €0.0653 to €0.0496/kWh, depending on the system size. For other systems up to 100 kW in size, there is a fixed FIT of €0.046/kWh.

UK-based Aurora Energy Research has analyzed the cost of producing hydrogen from electrolyzers under four different business models in eight European countries.
The report shows that green hydrogen could be produced in some European countries in 2030 for around €3/kg, thus reaching cost parity with blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas, with storage of the carbon dioxide released in the process. However, it cannot compete with gray hydrogen – for this, the costs would have to drop to around €2/kg.
A comparison of different business models shows that the most competitive system design differs from country to country and even from region to region. In countries such as Norway, Spain and Great Britain, the cheapest way to produce green hydrogen would be to couple an electrolyzer with solar and wind energy systems directly on site. The researchers said the ideal business model here would be to optimize capacity utilization via a flexible adjustment to the respective wind and solar power capacity.
According to Aurora Energy Research, Germany is one of the countries with the highest production costs. The cheapest projects in Germany are grid-connected electrolyzers that can be operated flexibly. In this way, periods of high electricity costs can be avoided and operating costs can be reduced. Due to high connection costs and network fees, green hydrogen in Germany will not reach cost parity with blue hydrogen until the mid-2030s, said the researchers,
Aurora Energy Research has also modeled what would be necessary to achieve production costs of €2/kg. With an electrolyzer utilization rate of 50%, average electricity costs of €10/MWh would be needed, and this is unrealistic, at least over the next few years. Targeted support from governments is therefore needed in the 2020s to promote the development of a green hydrogen economy and reduce costs, said the researchers.

Australian businessman Andrew Forrest confirmed on Sunday that his privately owned Squadron Energy has acquired the two-stage Clarke Creek wind, solar PV and battery development in central Queensland, Australia. He said that contracts have already been issued for the immediate start of construction of the first 450MW wind stage of the renewable energy project.
Squadron Energy said the proposed 1.2GW Clarke Creek wind and solar farm, which is being developed about 150 kilometers northwest of Rockhampton, will be the largest renewable energy precinct in the southern hemisphere upon completion. It said the project will produce enough wind, solar and battery energy to power more than 660,000 Queensland households and will export lower-cost electricity directly into the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Forrest said the acquisition marks a landmark moment for Australia’s green energy future.
“We have commenced construction of what will be the largest renewable energy precinct in the southern hemisphere – but I am delighted to say that we will not hold this record for long, with other renewable energy projects under development that will surpass our project in scale,” he said. “We intend to bring on other projects which will be larger than today’s record.”
The Clarke Creek project, originally developed by Lacour Energy and Goldwind, includes an 800MW wind farm, up to 400MW of solar installations, and an unspecified battery energy storage facility. There have been reports that Squadron Energy is looking to install up to 2GWh of battery storage at the site.
With grid connection, long-term supply agreements and all necessary state and federal approvals for Clarke Creek already in place, Squadron Energy said it will now accelerate the start of construction, with stage one set to be fully operational in 2024. The company said stage two could go online in 2026.
“Due to its combination of solar, wind and battery technologies, it will help directly lower power prices for millions of Queensland households and businesses,” Squadron Energy said.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk welcomed the commitment from Squadron Energy. She said the project would generate jobs and help the government achieve its renewable energy ambitions.
“Delivering such a huge renewable energy boost takes Queensland closer to achieving our targets of 50% renewable energy by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050,” she said.
Forrest said development approval for the project was secured in May 2018, followed by federal environmental approval in November 2018 and grid-connection approval earlier this year. A supply deal for most of the output of the first stage has also been secured.
In August 2020, government-owned Stanwell Corp. and the state government announced a 346.5MW power purchase agreement for the 450MW first stage of the Clarke Creek Wind Farm as part of a 15-year commitment to the project.

The technological shift prompted by manufacturers nearing PERC's conversion efficiency threshold of 23.7% – for commercially produced products – is one of the predictions made by Denver-based Clean Energy Associates (CEA) in its survey of the solar manufacturing industry during the last three months of 2021.
The analyst also revealed Chinese manufacturer GCL exited the solar cell production market in the fourth quarter of last year, contributing to a slower-than-expected expansion of PV cell and module capacity expansion.
In this month’s edition, pv magazine takes a deep dive into the world of electromobility, with 22 pages of analysis taking in the market growth and expectations for electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide; how electricity networks will need to grow and adapt to make room for the electrification of transport; and the vital role for solar in all of this. We examine the growing trend for residential and commercial EV chargers linked to PV and optimized to make the most of solar kilowatt-hours, and take a look at some of the early movers working on vehicle-integrated PV – from solar sunroofs to full integration in vehicle bodywork. We also consider a range of e-mobility applications, from commercial trucks to family cars to electric bikes and other “last mile” delivery vehicles.
With the CEA citing the removal of old production facilities by Chinese manufacturers; tough global manufacturing conditions; and a difficult trade relationship between solar superpower China and the US as other reasons for delayed cell and module capacities, the analyst said the picture was entirely different for the manufacture of solar panel raw material polysilicon.
The report, announced in a press release issued by the CEA on Friday, estimated 500,000 tons of annual poly production capacity will come online this year, with a lot of facilities that were set in train in late 2020 due to hit full production in “early to mid 2022.”
That should see a reverse in polysilicon prices which rose sharply last year, contributing to solar panel price hikes. Chinese polysilicon manufacturer Daqo today announced it had signed a five-year deal with an unnamed “leading solar manufacturing company in China.” Daqo expects to supply around 30,000 tons of poly to the end of 2026, with the actual volume and prices to be determined monthly.
Although there were fewer new cell and module production lines ramped up in the closing months of last year, the CEA said it expects expansions to resume pace this year with around 45GW of new annual solar panel manufacturing capacity to arrive by the end of December, and more than 55GW next year.
Chinese demand could play a significant factor with the CEA speculating Beijing could remove clean electricity from this year's application of its “dual control” policy, which limits energy consumption and the energy intensity of manufacturing processes and which last year prompted electricity shortages.
The solar market will also be pumped over the next four years by manufacturing plans announced in Europe, as the region attempts to wean itself off an over dependence on Chinese supply chains.
The CEA expects solar ingot and wafer production lines could “potentially” amount to more than 20GW of annual capacity in Europe in 2025; cell output capability “could grow” to more than 30GW in that year; and the module figure can be “expected to increase” to more than 45GW by the middle of the decade.

Through CBD, a large number of substrates can be coated in a single run with a proper chemical bath design. “CBD is an inexpensive deposition method that can produce highly homogeneous layers on large areas at low temperatures,” the scientists explained. “CBD has previously been employed at the industrial scale to produce cadmium sulfide (CdS) and zinc sulfide (ZnS) buffer layers in CIGS photovoltaic modules.” The deposition process was performed for a hour and the temperature of the CBD reactor was maintained stable at 70 degrees Celsius. “The desired SnO2 thickness was achieved by repeating the CBD deposition process multiple times. Finally, the substrates were rinsed with water and annealed at 180 degrees Celsius for one hour,” the research group stated.
The solar cell was fabricated with a glass-coated substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), the SnO2 layer, a film made of a perovskite known as CsI/PbI that was deposited via slot-die coating, a spiro-OMeTAD hole-blocking layer, and a gold (Au) metal contact. “This two-step deposition process, previously developed in our laboratory, allows the deposition of uniform and pinhole-free perovskite layers,” the academics said, referring to the slot-die technique used. “During the process, an intermediate layer containing CsI and PbI2 is deposited by a first slot-die coating step, then vacuum-treated to remove excess solvent and thereafter converted to perovskite [by] applying the organic cations solution on top using a second slot-die coating step.”
The module was built with 19.2%-efficient perovskite cells that were connected in series through laser ablation with P1, P2, and P3 scribing steps. The champion panel, with an aperture area of 40cm2, achieved a power conversion efficiency of 17%, an open-circuit voltage of 17.61V, a short-circuit current of 1.3mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 73.5%. “We believe that the relatively small drop in efficiency from small cells to 40cm2 modules is due to the homogeneous deposition of the SnO2 layer and of the perovskite layer, due to the use of [a] scalable technique,” the researchers concluded.
The mini perovskite module is introduced in the paper “Industrially Compatible Fabrication Process of Perovskite-Based Mini-Modules Coupling Sequential Slot-Die Coating and Chemical Bath Deposition”, published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.

Electric vehicle owners may soon be able to simply park and charge, no wires needed, with a new product under development from WiTricity.
The company has announced a limited beta release of its Halo wireless charging station this year, with wider availability in 2023. WiTricity has already been providing EV automakers with factory-installed EV wireless charging tech, and it now plans to make a consumer-level aftermarket product.
The Halo system can deliver 11kW of wireless charging. It consists of three key components, including a power receiver installed on the vehicle, a wall box that connects to wired power, and a charging pad installed on (or in) the ground.
The system uses core magnetic resonance charging to power EVs. WiTricity’s charging system, peripheral systems, and controlling software have been awarded more than 1,200 patents. The technology is has been instrumental in developing global wireless charging standards, including SAE International, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the Standardization Administration of the People’s Republic of China (GB).
A pilot Tesla Model 3 has been running fully on wireless charging in Watertown, Massachusetts, since October. The vehicle can be fully charged in less than six hours, which is just as fast as plugging in at home. 
“Our successful upgrade of the Tesla Model 3 is resonating with consumers as an easier, more convenient way to charge their EVs,” said WiTricity CEO Alex Gruzen. “With the WiTricity Halo solution you just park and walk away, knowing you will return to a fully charged car. Day to day, it’s as if your car had infinite range, which will help accelerate EV adoption and propel us to a greener future.”
The company said it is currently evaluating which models to offer wireless upgrades for, based on customer demand, technical feasibility, and automaker support. Companies interested in the beta program can follow on the WiTricity website.
