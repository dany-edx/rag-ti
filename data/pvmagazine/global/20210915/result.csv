The credit facility is being set up by the ARM-Harith Infrastructure Investments Ltd joint venture established by Nigerian financial services business Asset & Resource Management Holding Co Ltd, and Johannesburg-based private equity firm Harith General Partners.
A press release issued today to publicize plans for the ARM-Harith Cities and Climate Transition (ACT) Fund stated the facility is being designed with the help of the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance backed by the governments of the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, and the U.K., plus the New York-based Rockefeller Foundation.
It is hoped the fund will raise $250 million of ‘blended‘ – public and private – finance to back clean energy projects as well as sustainable mobility, waster and waste infrastructure in the West Africa region, with a focus on Nigeria.
Quoted in the press release, Harith General Partners deputy chief executive Alwyn Wessels said: “Harith, as a partner with, and investor in infrastructure funds across Africa, is excited by the prospects of the ACT fund, and the potential for the fund to promote real climate action in West Africa.”
The ARM-Harith Infrastructure Investments Ltd joint venture is regulated in Mauritius.

The Madrid-based developer's GRS business will run the Greefspan II project, which Gransolar said features almost 189,000 modules expected to generate 150 GWh per year and to generate enough solar electricity to power 20,000 households.
The project was developed with the Umbono Energy unit of Houston-based private equity and venture capital investor Umbono Capital, and Gransolar said the project had created around 700 jobs during construction, in and around the agricultural and stock farming town of Douglas.
Gransolar claims to operate four solar plants with a combined generation capacity of 285 MW in the Northern Cape and Free State provinces of South Africa.

Interested developers will have time until November 22 to submit their bids.
The project is being developed under the World Bank Group’s Scaling Solar program and with the support of the French Development Agency and the European Union. The Central African nation joined the Scaling Solar initiative in mid-June.
Under development since 2017, the solar park will use the same grid connection as a co-located, 100 MW, diesel-fueled thermal power plant that was commissioned in 2017. They will both be connected to a medium-voltage substation in Zabori.
Niger had an installed PV capacity of around 27 MW at the end of 2020. The country is currently meeting all of its power demand with electricity imports from Nigeria. Niger's electric utility, Nigelec, has an installed power generation capacity of around 140 MW. The access rate to power in the country is only 15%.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/15/legal-dispute-over-south-african-content-rules-in-2-gw-tech-neutral-tender/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH AFRICA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2021",Legal dispute over South African content rules in 2 GW tech-neutral tender,"The South African Department of Mineral Resources (DMRE) launched a tech-neutral procurement process for 2 GW of capacity in August 2020, in response to a chronic short-term electricity supply gap that has been affecting the country and its mining sector. Renewable energy developers were also allowed to participate.
The Risk Mitigation Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (RMIPPPP), was able to attract 28 bid responses with a potential contracted capacity of approximately 5.12 GW. The DMRE selected eight preferred bids totaling 1.85 GW. Around 60% of the 2 GW tender capacity was awarded to several floating power plants powered by liquefied natural gas, but several PV projects were ultimately selected and they had to compete in ensuring a certain level of local content requirements – not only with other technologies, but also with each other.
“Local content under the program is calculated as a percentage of total project value,” Chris Ahlfeldt, an energy specialist at Blue Horizon Energy Consulting Services, told pv magazine. “The RMIPPPP provides detailed local content requirements for 14 components plus subcomponents that might be used in the power projects such as electric cables and steel products.”
Ahlfeldt said that the Solar PV System and Components category requires a 15% total local content threshold and specifies subcomponents with their own thresholds.
“For example, the module frames, DC combiner boxes, and mounting structures thresholds are 65% or higher suggesting that most of this equipment should be made locally,” Ahlfeldt explained. “It also specifies that 15% of laminated PV modules need to be sourced locally, however, most of the local solar PV lamination and assembly capacity in the country went out of business due to the long delays in previous government procurement rounds.”
Engineering News has reported that these rules did not apply to all module providers, however, as companies such as ARTsolar and Seraphim Solar South Africa – a unit of Vietnamese supplier Seraphim – were reportedly granted exemptions by the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC). Competing supplier Suntech Solar Power South Africa also filed a lawsuit, in which it describes the exemptions as “unlawful.”
The South African media outlet said that Suntech Solar has noted that the exemption granted to the two companies excluded all other module suppliers from competitively participating in the RMIPPPP.
“(It) forces preferred bidders to procure from ARTsolar and Seraphim and its Chinese partners, LONGi Solar and Seraphim China,” Engineering News cited Suntech Solar as saying in the lawsuit.
Suntech Solar also reportedly said that the exemption was granted in May, two months after the preferred bidders were announced, and without industry consultations.
In a statement to pv magazine, ARTSolar CEO Viren Gosai said that the company has taken the necessary steps to instruct its attorneys to oppose the relief sought in the court application, which is what the Engineering News article focuses on.
“It is our view that there remains no basis for the relief sought in the Court Application and we thus look forward to the court adjudicating on the matter and placing our assertions beyond doubt,” he said. Seraphim had not responded to pv magazine‘s request to provide a statement on the matter at the time of publication.
According to Ahlfeldt, another problem related to local content requirements in the auction is that technologies such as floating LNG have been given the aforementioned exemption.
“The powerships have been given a local content exemption from the DTIC for local manufacturing since they are built overseas and docked at several ports in the country,” he said. “They'll also depend primarily on imported LNG fuel, so it's difficult to understand how these projects would meet local economic development or environmental goals of the country.”
Ahlfeldt said he believes that solar and wind resources can both provide less expensive and clean electricity for the country, but noted that it's unclear why the DMRE wants to sign 20-year PPAs for these LNG powerships. He also said that a sustainable local solar PV manufacturing industry in South Africa will require consistent local demand to compete on cost and quality with larger international manufacturers.
“Reliable annual procurement from the government would help create this demand,” he concluded.

The EU wants to raise €80 billion in bonds this year, plus “tens of billions of euros” of short-term bills, with the first auction of the latter, syndicated lending opportunities due to take place today. ‘Syndications' offer groups of lenders who are unable to sign up individually to provide the large sums of credit required, to do so collectively.
Pick up your copy of the September edition of pv magazine today for a detailed update on solar and battery storage in the United States, which faces a tough decision between taking advantage of Asian imports, or developing domestic manufacturing at the risk of slowing progress towards decarbonization.
Yesterday's €9 billion, seven-year bond issuance attracted offers for more than €103 billion of investment, with UK entities making up 39% of the successful subscribers, ahead of various European investors, and with 7% of the bonds issued to Asian backers and 2% to the rest of the world. Fund managers accounted for 36% of yesterday's subscribers, with central banks contributing a further 32%, and the markets operations of banks 21%.
The cash will go towards the EU's €800 billion ‘NextGenerationEU‘ Covid recovery package, which will run to the end of 2026 and include a €724 billion ‘recovery and resilience facility‘ (RRF) which will disburse grants and loans to member states who must agree to devote at least 37% of the windfall to green spending.
Latvia was latest EU member state to receive an advance payment of its RRF cash, with the commission announcing on Friday the Baltic state had banked an initial €237 million of its total €1.8 billion support package, all of which will be offered as non-repayable grants.
The commission's bond program has thus far raised €54 billion. An initial, ten-year, €20 billion instrument was issued on June 15; followed by a €9 billion, five-year and €6 billion, 30-year investment on June 29; and a 20-year, €10 billion issuance on July 13.
The EU has pledged to issue 30% of its bonds under a ‘green' label which commits their proceeds to be spent combating climate change, and last week said its first Covid-recovery green bond would be issued next month.

The scheme is open to companies specializing in district heating and offers rebates covering up to 15% of the total investment made to buy and install the heat pump, with developers being eligible for a maximum of DKK5 million for each project.
All selected projects will have to be completed within three years and be electrically powered. The agency also said the heat source must come from renewable energy or surplus heat, and that 50% of the heat production may be based on coal, oil or natural gas. “The target group is district heating developers with a high share of heat production based on coal, oil or natural gas,” it further explained. “The heat pump projects will help to displace the use of coal, oil and natural gas in the Danish district heating sector by replacing it with a more climate-friendly solution, in the form of electric heat pumps.”
Interested companies will have time until October 31 to send their applications.
In March, Danish gas transmission system operator Evida exempted homeowners and individuals that want to abandon gas and choose renewable energy for heating, from paying the grid disconnection fee. The scheme is being run on a first-come, first-served basis. The applicants of this scheme are also entitled to request additional funds for the installation of a heat pump or leasing of a heating system if they cannot afford the upfront costs for buying one. Furthermore, funds will be awarded if individual oil and gas boilers are converted to district heating.

According to Vorm, the new factory will have a capacity of 300 MW and will become operational in the spring of 2022. The company said it decided to invest in the new facility as Solarge produces solar panels that are not inferior to conventional glass modules in terms of energy yield but are suitable for almost all roofs due to their low weight.
The construction company also claims all materials in the modules developed by Solarge are 100% recyclable. “While conventional solar panels contain a lot of aluminum and glass, Solarge panels are made of fiber-reinforced thermoplastic polymers from Sabic,” it further explained. Sabic is a Saudi chemical company and a subsidiary of the state-owned energy company Saudi Aramco.
The Dutch start-up is currently producing the modules through a pilot line at its manufacturing facility. “The product will have a CO2 footprint which is 80% lower than conventional solar panels and the panel is completely circular in design and uses no per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) materials, unlike all other solar panels that use a polymeric film instead of glass,” the company's CCO Huib Van der Heuvel told pv magazine in early September.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/15/coupling-balcony-solar-panels-with-residential-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2021",Coupling balcony solar panels with residential storage,"Scientists at the Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology have analyzed different operational modes to combine residential batteries with balcony PV modules in apartment buildings in South Korea.
In the proposed configuration, the battery is included in the hybrid system, but only to discharge power to the home appliance connected to the load line. The load is supplied by the balcony PV modules or the battery power, with surplus power being stored in the storage system when needed.
“The battery is charged with grid power when the battery is in system check or the (state-of-charge) level of the battery is at an emergency level,” the research group said.
The researchers simulated the hybrid system in a demonstration house in the Korean city of Goyang, with a 2.016 kWh prototype LiFePO4 battery with an efficiency of 93%. The system included a south-oriented 1.2 kW balcony PV system, built with four 300 W modules connected in series, with an efficiency of 18%. The tilt angle was 70 degrees, paired with a 260 W electric fan representing the connection load.
The researchers calculated the storage capacity of the battery by considering the PV system's capacity and the total power consumption of the household. The academics said the basic settings for battery energy storage system operation were set to battery bulk charge voltage of 58.4 V, with a battery discharge cut-off voltage of 41 V and a battery recharge voltage of 44 V.
“This system can be used anywhere, not just in South Korea, because of its small capacity,” researcher Ji-Young Eum told pv magazine.
The researchers evaluated the performance of the system under four operational modes. They looked at a configuration in which the PV system preferentially supplies the load and only charges the battery with PV power, as well as a system that supplies PV power to the load first and charges the battery with PV and grid power. In addition, they considered a design in which the battery is preferentially charged with PV power and only the PV power is supplied, alongside a system that preferentially charges the battery with PV power and then with PV and grid power.
“The experiment lasted about three months from Aug. 21, 2019, to Nov. 8, 2019,” the scientists said. “In order to check the charging and discharging results, the experiment was conducted on all days except rainy days and days that the apparatus were checked.”
Under the first mode, approximately 92% of the battery capacity was discharged and about 91% of the load was supplied to the battery, they found. They also observed that the battery voltage reached the full discharge voltage range of 33 V and, as a result, the battery was not used, as the battery voltage could not be maintained until the next PV charge.
Under the second mode, in which PV electricity was injected into the load with priority, it was almost impossible to charge the battery if there is no remaining PV power after the load is supplied, they said. They claimed that this makes it necessary to prevent the battery discharge by reducing its idle time and the use of grid electricity.
The third operational mode ensured that the battery was completely discharged and the battery voltage was not maintained until the charge of PV power the next day, when the PV electricity was then conveyed to the load and the grid. Under the fourth configuration, the battery had a good chance to end up being not fully discharged due to the charging of the grid power. And when the battery voltage reached the full discharge protection voltage, the battery was charged with grid power.
“The operation modes of the residential battery energy storage system … with the balcony PV were confirmed in individual households of apartment houses through experiments for each operation mode of the residential (battery energy storage system),” the researchers said. “The results suggest that mode four is the most appropriate among the four operation modes of (battery energy storage system). Nevertheless, some functions are still required to apply the scheme to individual households of apartments.”
The researchers described their work in “Operation Modes of Residential BESS with Balcony-PV for Apartment Houses in Korea,” which was recently published in Sustainability.

WattEV has won a $5 million grant to support the buildout of a 4 MW charging station for 12 electric trucks in Bakersfield, California, backed by an onsite solar+storage facility. The grant is from the California Energy Commission, and will represent one of the state’s first solar-powered truck charging stops dedicated to heavy-duty electric trucks.
The facility will be supported by 5 MW of solar power and second-life energy storage. As the site scales to as many as 40 charging stations, it will be upgraded to 25 MW of solar+storage at the 110-acre site, with 40 MW of charging capacity.
The site will host light-duty, medium and heavy chargers with rates of 250 kW, 350 kW, and 1 MW capacities. The 1 MW chargers will deliver 320 miles of range to a Class 8, 80,000 pound truck in 30 minutes. WattEV has yet to provide any additional hardware or design specifics.
Joining WattEV on the project are the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, the Central California Asthma Collaborative, Greenlots, and Power Electronics, among others.
In addition to the Bakersfield project, WattEV said it is in the planning stages for similar projects in San Bernardino and Gardena in Southern California. Both of those truck stops will serve the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach, and the warehouses fed by goods coming through the ports.
To date, WattEV has raised $6 million in private equity seed funding led by Canon Equity to enable these projects and support further expansion. It said it expects to break ground at the Bakersfield facility in October. The initial buildout will cost in excess of $10 million, an is expected to take two years to construct. The company said its goal of 40 charging stations will likely cost more than $30 million.
The company said it hopes to have 12,000 trucks under management by 2030, with 1 GW of charging capacity. Recently, it signed a deal with Volvo for six VNR Electric Class 8 trucks. The VNR has a 264-kWh lithium-ion battery, which charges up to 80% within 70 minutes. It has an operating range of up to 150 miles.
The company has secured purchase incentive vouchers from the California Air Resources Board’s Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project. It has also applied for an additional 24 vouchers, in a bid to reach 30 units before the end of 2022. It also placed a reservation for 50 Tesla semis.
In addition, WattEV has signed its first electric truck transportation contract with TTSI for 16 trucks to haul loads from ports to regional destinations. TTSI will use WattEV’s trucks, charging infrastructure, and EV management services.
One question is how the solar+storage microgrid facility will be used. It’s probably safe to assume that the facility will be used to mitigate energy costs, while prioritizing demand charge management.
The quantity and source for the second-life batteries is not yet known. Eventually, batteries may come from used electric trucks, creating a circular economy for batteries.
When combined with software being developed by WattEV to meet transportation company sustainability requirements, a growing percentage of emission-free electricity (particularly solar) could directly power the trucks.
When considering the large volumes of the California power grid which need to be upgraded in order to carry higher loads, and that those costs are typically shouldered by solar developers, it may well be that the solar+storage facility was chosen to minimize transmission upgrade costs.

During the inauguration of the recent LatAm Future Energy Solar and Wind Virtual Summit event, the vice minister of electricity and non-renewable natural resources of the new government of Ecuador, Gabriel Argüello, announced plans to launch two new renewable energy auctions.
Although Ecuador already produces 91% of its electricity with clean energy, especially hydroelectric power, Argüello said he wants to increase generation from wind and solar sources. In August, the government approved a new version of the electricity master plan until 2031, in order to support these aims.
“The new catalyst is the incorporation of the increase from 200 to 500 renewable MW,” said the deputy minister.
To do this, the auction will be held at the end of November. The government expects an estimated investment of $750 million and said that all selected projects will have to be operational at the beginning of 2024.
In 2022, a second 500 MW procurement exercise will be launched. At a later date, other new auctions may be considered, the government said, without providing any additional details.
The Ecuadorian authorities held an initial 200 MW PV tender in 2019 and 2020. The winner was Spanish PV developer Solarpack.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Latin American country had only installed 28 MW of PV capacity by the end of 2020. Over the past seven years, it has deployed just 2 MW of PV.

The Invesco Solar ETF, an ETF that tracks the MAC Global Solar Energy Index, underperformed relative to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial in the month of August. The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) decreased 7.0%, while the S&P 500 increased by 1.1% and the DJIA increased by 0.5% in August. The top five performing solar stocks in the U.S. market witnessed gains and losses. They include Array Technologies (38.8%), First Solar, Inc. (9.9%), SolarEdge Technologies (4.0%), Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital (0.5%), and Atlantic Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc. (-3.3%).
Up to Aug. 25, the Invesco Solar ETF has experienced a pullback. Looking forward, the U.S. industry outlook for the remainder of the year is uncertain. In late June, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued a withhold release order (WRO) on imported silica-based products produced by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co., one of the world’s largest metallurgical-grade silicon producers, for allegedly using forced labor in the Xinjiang region of China. With the CBP making more detainments this month, many major players could continue to face a negative impact, as additional detainments are likely to follow.
The WRO on Hoshine-affiliated products could shake up the supply chain. Currently, Array Technologies (ARRY), Canadian Solar (CSIQ), Daqo (DQ), FTC Solar (FTCI), Hannon Armstrong (HASI), Jinko Solar (JKS), Shoals Technologies, (SHLS), and Renesola (SOL) are facing potential project delays, as not enough modules can make it into the country in time.
Others, such as First Solar (FSLR), Sunpower (SPWR), and Maxeon (MAXN) could benefit from additional enforcement, as Hoshine is not included in any of their supply chains. While the CBP looks to define the compliance process and establish a system to trace silica-based products, delays in projects will occur. As a result, companies will look for alternative non-China options to source more polysilicon.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/15/off-grid-data-center-powered-exclusively-by-pv-in-australia/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2021",Off-grid data center powered exclusively by PV in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
Australia's Edge Centres had seemingly sprung up overnight when pv magazine first wrote about it in May. CEO Jonathan Eaves told pv magazine Australia this week that it plans to have its first Victorian off-grid data center up and running by November, fitted with 1 MW of solar and 48 hours of battery and UPS backup technology.
Edge Centres said on Monday that it has already secured development approval for the site, which will be in the central Victorian town of Bendigo, about 150 kilometers north of Melbourne.
In case you blinked and missed it, Edge Centres aims to roll out a string of grid-independent autonomous data centers across regional Australia, powered by ground-mounted and rooftop solar arrays, coupled with battery storage. It claims to be the world’s only off-grid edge data center operator, and its service is set to put regional Australia on a par with metro communications technology for the first time ever, in a carbon-negative manner.
Edge Centre’s facility in Bendigo, the EC3, will be 100% solar-powered and will be built on a site that was previously a car yard. Eaves said he is confident the center will be operational in just two months, as the solar array, which will be fully ground-mounted in this case, comes in what he calls “kit form,” just like the insulated center facility itself. This means that the only physical installation left is to lay a concrete slab and connect the solar.
“Everything else comes ready-made,” Eaves told pv magazine Australia.
The company said Bendigo is one of four additional Edge Centre facilities on track to begin operating in Australia this year, including another site in Victoria. So far, the company has four centers online, including a facility in the northern New South Wales town of Grafton, as well as three in Queensland, in the municipalities of Townsville, Cairns and Mackay.
The Grafton site which has been operational since April and is fitted with a 1 MW solar array, backed up by lithium-ion battery storage. But Eaves said the Queensland sites all still need to be retrofitted with solar, which is ultimately his plan.
In May, Edge Centres announced a partnership with Alan Kei Associates to launch its first data centers in Japan. Eaves said land for the Japanese facilities has been secured and solar installations will begin in October.
Transformative facilities
In Australia, regional data processing still generally occurs in metropolitan-based centers, so it takes time and extra processing power to make the long return journey to more remote areas.
Eaves previously painted a sample picture for pv magazine, saying that data coming from a smart “agrotech” tractor working autonomously in regional New South Wales today would likely travel all the way to Sydney, where the data would be correlated and computed, before the outcome could get sent back.
“Processing at the edge reduces that time, but it also reduces the workload on the internet,” he says. Regional Australia also pays between two to three times as much for data and processing as city-dwellers, meaning their worse experience also has the double kick of costing more.
“Edge centers,” as the facilities themselves are also called, change that by setting up closer to the regional and rural populations they serve, delivering cloud computing resources and cached content to users more efficiently.
“Right now, Australia is on the cusp of an edge infrastructure wave, and Edge Centres is building ahead of this generational spike in demand for (Internet of Things), edge computing, and cloud. Building ahead of this wave means that we have time to build and connect the necessary infrastructure so that these regional hubs that haven’t been connected previously can be ready when it hits,” Eaves said.
He noted a handful of companies are now racing to provide these services to the previously forgotten regional populations of Australia.
Core aims
Eaves is no stranger to data center design and construction, having built facilities in Australia and the United Arab Emirates. His newly minted company is specifically targeting internet service providers, retail service providers, and managed service providers with services such as cloud connect, dark fiber, and IP transit. These are delivered through data centre designs that are minimally dependent on utility power and have a carbon-negative footprint, the company says. Its sites are “carrier-neutral,” it added, to encourage competition, enrich its ecosystem, and to drive down prices for the customer.
Over the next 18 months, Edge Centres plans to scale up its business across Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and Japan. It hopes to reach 20 sites by the end of 2022.
