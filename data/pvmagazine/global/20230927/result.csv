Indian PV manufacturer Gautam Solar said it will double its annual solar module manufacturing capacity to 2 GW by the end of the 2024 calendar year.
It will invest around INR 150 crore ($18.1 million) to set up the manufacturing capacity, which will be used to produce n-type TOPCon and mono PERC modules. 
Gautam Solar supplies modules for rooftop, utility-scale, and C&I solar plants. It recently exhibited its n-type TOPCon solar modules at the RE+ conference in Las Vegas, as it is introducing the new products to the US market.
Gautam Solar has recently expanded its module manufacturing capacity from 400 MW to 1 GW via the deployment of a 500 MW of TOPCon module production line.
It procured the fully automated, n-type TOPCon production line from China's Jinchen. The supply deal between the two companies was signed at SNEC, 16th International Photovoltaic Power Generation and Smart Energy Conference and Exhibition.

AMEA Power secured the project through a tender in 2019, as part of Tunisia’s Concession Regime initiative, aimed at ramping up solar project development in the country.
This marks the first of five solar plants awarded under Tunisia's 100 MW tender scheme to achieve financial closure. The consortium that won the tender submitted a bid of TND 97.92 ($30.83)/MWh, which was one of the lowest global bids for solar at the time.
The plant will be operated by Kairouan Solar Plant, a subsidiary of AMEA Power. It is funded by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and International Finance Corp. (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group. The project will become operational by mid-2025, under a build-own-operate (BOO) model, with the goal of producing 222 GWh of clean energy per year.
Tunisian Prime Minister Ahmed Hachani noted the government's strong commitment to developing the Kairouan solar project as a significant step in the country's energy transition. Tunisia, heavily reliant on gas imports, aims to achieve 35% renewable energy production by 2025.
Sérgio Pimenta, IFC's vice president for Africa, said the project will attract private investment for other renewable projects in Tunisia. Kevin Kariuki,
According to recent statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Tunisia had 197 MW of installed solar capacity by the end of 2022.

Piotr Pająk, a PV analyst for Gramwzielone.pl, told pv magazine that the policy changes will “significantly increase investments” in commercial rooftop solar installations.
“[Currently] construction works involving the installation of photovoltaic devices with an installed electrical power exceeding 50 kW require a building permit,” Pająk said. “[But soon] photovoltaic installations with a capacity of up to 150 kW will be exempt from the need to obtain a building permit.”
Pająk said installers who build PV systems above 6.5 kW in size will still need to undergo “consultations” with fire protection experts, as Poland's Construction Law remains unchanged.
He also highlighted that the recent amendments to the RES Act, passed on Aug. 17, include provisions to enhance the potential for PV energy generation on commercial properties. The regulations will facilitate the construction of direct lines connecting renewable energy producers with consumers, bypassing public power lines.
The RES Act's changes also expand the size of PV installation development areas. According to the new regulations, obtaining a decision on environmental conditions for PV installations outside the specified areas will be required for areas smaller than 1 hectare, excluding PV systems on roofs and building facades.
Poland had the highest number of full-time workers employed in the EU's solar industry by the end of 2022, with 150,000 employees, said SolarPower Europe. In July, Polish research institute IEO said that the country's installed capacity could more than double to 26,791 MW by the end of 2025.

“A major expansion of solar energy, in particular, will bring further economic benefits and employment for years to come. Solar energy is dependable and predictable and will play an increasing part in the generation mix out to 2030 and beyond,” the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications’ press release stated.
A total of 36 projects applied for RESS 3 and 33 qualified, as determined by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Eamon Ryan, the EirGrid report stated. Only 31 projects managed to submit prices before the deadline, while eight were deemed provisionally unsuccessful.
Minister Ryan said that while these projects garnered lower volumes compared to previous auction rounds, RESS 3 targeted “mature, shovel-ready projects” that already have planning permissions and grid connection offers. The round also focussed on projects that could be delivered by 2027 latest. A fourth – and “larger” – RESS auction is expected to occur next year, he said.
“The auction results will help bolster energy security and system resilience, contribute to emissions reduction over the second carbon budget period, and continue a steady rollout of renewable energy projects to support our EU renewable targets in 2027 and 2030,” Minister Ryan said.
Ireland has deployed around 680 MW of solar power spread across 59,888 generators to date, according to a recent report by the Irish Solar Energy Association. Most of this capacity originates from seven large-scale plants surpassing 5 MW, totaling 349 MW, and 208 MW from microgeneration solar arrays, encompassing systems up to 12 kW.
The Irish government set a target of producing 80% renewable electricity by 2030.

However, the advantages have always come at the cost of power conversion efficiency – until very recently.
“This year carbon electrode-based devices broke the psychological barrier of 20%, efficiency with several teams in several different locations announcing they had crossed the threshold,” Lukas Wagner, a researcher at Philipps-University Marburg, told pv magazine.
Researchers have made significant advancements in carbon electrode perovskite solar cells (c-PSC). In February, devices with 21.2% power conversion efficiency, as well as 19.6%-efficient mini-modules with stability above 4,390 hours, were reported in Nature Energy.
In June, the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) published a paper showcasing a c-PSC with 21.0% efficiency in ACS Energy Letters. Chinese researchers, meanwhile, reported a c-PSC with 20.8% efficiency, while another team developed an indoor c-PSC with an efficiency exceeding 30%.
Some experts see carbon electrodes as a promising avenue for the commercialization of low-cost, stable perovskite solar modules, as noted in the journal Electronics in February.
With  stability and efficiency on an upwards trajectory, there are now enough c-PSC companies and research teams exploring the technology to merit a conference – the First International Conference on Carbon Electrode-based Perovskite Solar Cells. It has attracted 34 speakers and more than 220 participants to participate in October, according to Wagner.
The ability to print the all or most of the cell stack is also a big part of the appeal of carbon electrodes.
“The cell stacks can be printed which eases upscaling and process with low capital expenditure,” said Wagner.
The event will feature speakers from various research groups and perovskite startup companies, including Switzerland-based materials firm Solaronix, Polish indoor/outdoor perovskite solar cell manufacturer Saule Technologies, Canadian thin-film startup Rayleigh Solar Tech, and perovskite materials specialist Greatcell Solar Italia.

The scientists said that the thermal properties of bio-based walls were recently enhanced by the construction industry, and prices remain at “ultra-low” levels.
“The research emphasizes achieving significant energy savings and improving indoor comfort through the integration of photovoltaic systems and bio-based materials,” researcher Sara El Hassani told pv magazine. “We used a combination of passive and active strategies – passive approaches include the use of local eco-materials for insulation, while active approaches involve the introduction of renewable energy techniques.”
They used locally produced Alfa fiber as adobes and local clayey soil as a binder, mixed in a weight ratio of 8%. They also created a comparison sample using only clayey soil. These mixtures were then pressed into a mold to create experimental bricks for analysis. After testing the bricks, they created and simulated a thermal profile for each of them in a case study.
“The building consists of two bedrooms and one living room, with a total surface area of 40 m2,” the academics explained. “To be representative, the location of the building is presumed to be in Oujda City and occupied by three persons.”
The researchers improved the thermal resistance of a 45 cm-thick wall from 0.549 m2K/W in the clayey soil-only bricks to 1.125 m2K/W in the combined mixture. They also increased the time lag of the building envelope from 18.5 hours to 23.2 hours. Time lag measures how quickly a material responds to temperature changes.
In simulated semi-arid climate conditions in eastern Morocco, the bio-material demonstrated intelligent behavior, as reported by the research team.
“For example, on the coldest day, the bio-sourced wall increases the indoor temperature by up to 1 C, which could be very effective in the energy consumption of buildings during winter seasons,” the researchers said. “Furthermore, on the hottest day, the same mixture has led to a reduction of up to 2 C.”
Overall, the bio-based walls reduced simulated peak heating loads by around 24.3%, and decreased cooling loads by about 26.7%.
“All of these findings support the use of plant fibers as a sustainable practice in developing local and efficient adobes for improving passive heating and cooling in rural arid and semi-arid regions,” the scientists said.
The researchers proceeded to determine the required PV system for the case study house based on the heating loads. With optimization software, they identified the most cost-effective system, featuring 6.01 kW of capacity.
This system's total cost, including capital, operating, and replacement costs minus a salvage value at the end of its 25-year lifespan, amounted to $11,560. With these values, the system achieved an LCOE of $0.218/kWh.
“These findings indicated that combining available solar energy with locally produced bio-based construction materials could be a viable approach for achieving carbon neutrality and building energy-efficient ultra-low-cost rural housing,” the researchers said.
Their study, “Towards rural net-zero energy buildings through integration of photovoltaic systems within bio-based earth houses: Case study in Eastern Morocco,” was recently published at Solar Energy. The research group includes scientists from Mohammed 1st University and the Green Energy Park. They said they will try to develop a standalone PV system within a bio-based building prototype in the future.

The days of the solar industry operating as a “net metering type of industry” are “starting to be numbered,” said Jigar Shah, the director of the US Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, at the recent RE+ 2023 conference in Las Vegas.
“Most solar systems come with batteries, and most are integrating smart panels,” he said. “They’re integrating demand response and load control capabilities into the inverter controls.”
Because a solar-plus-storage system with those features can earn its owner compensation through participation in a virtual power plant (VPP) – an aggregation of similar systems often managed by a third-party aggregator – Shah encouraged the solar industry to see its future in VPPs. The deployment of VPPs to date is shown in the featured image above.
Besides distributed storage, other distributed energy resources that can be aggregated into a VPP include electric vehicle chargers, smart thermostats, and smart electric water heaters.
Shah said that electric utilities are “looking to bury the hatchet and really deploy a lot of these technologies at scale” through VPPs. “Frankly, it is the only way for them to integrate all of the huge load that is coming their way.”
Shah said utilities Duke Energy, serving the Carolinas, and Luma Energy in Puerto Rico have announced large VPP projects, the latter with the residential solar firm Sunnova.
Addressing the solar industry professionals in his audience at RE+, Shah said “you’re the ones who should be integrating all of the technologies that are shown on the floor out there, into a coherent package.”
For its part, the DoE anticipates lending support on the order of $100 million to advance VPPs, Shah said. Sunnova’s inclusion of low- and moderate-income Puerto Ricans in its VPP project is being supported by $3 million in loan support, while other applicants are already preparing $30 million in loan requests.

The report stated there were 648,000 workers employed in the solar industry at the end of 2022, which was a 39% increase from the year prior. Poland recorded the largest proportion of full-time workers, at almost 150,000 people by the end of last year, followed by Spain and Germany.
Installation continues to dominate the workforce, accounting for 84% of employees, according to the report.
“Approximately 8% of the total jobs were associated with operation and maintenance, while manufacturing accounted for 7%, and decommissioning and recycling made a minor share of 1%,” said SolarPower Europe.
Demand for installation jobs drives the need for a larger workforce. However, once installed, solar panels require minimal physical maintenance and fewer workers. Inverter manufacturing, on the other hand, employs the most workers in Europe, thanks to the widespread presence of inverter companies, including many global market players.
The report said 2022 was a “pivotal” year, as operation and maintenance jobs surpassed manufacturing jobs. It said that this reflected the “discrepancies between the installation rates of PV, and the slow expansion of a local supply chain.”
In the September issue of pv magazine, we examine booming solar markets in Brazil and Mexico; investigate whether TOPCon modules really are more susceptible to degradation than PERC products; attempt to unravel how US solar manufacturers can qualify for domestic content bonuses under the Inflation Reduction Act; and look at how homeowners can achieve the residential solar, battery, and EV dream.
Supporting these employees may come with growing pains. The report suggested several policy recommendations to nurture the workforce. Recommendations include launching communication and education campaigns about “green-collar” jobs, providing specialized training for relevant professionals, facilitating the freedom of movement of workers within the European Union while ensuring cross-border recognition of skills, and integrating the needs of the solar sector's workforce into existing immigration policies.
Using data and modeling collected as part of the organization’s SolarPower Europe's Global Market Outlook 2023-2027, released in June, the organization predicts that the sector will swell to 1.2 million employees by 2027.

Pico-hydro systems are all-hydropower systems with a capacity of less than 5 kW and are commonly used as a cheap and easy-to-deploy source of power in the world’s most inaccessible places.
“Our system was designed to run continuously with the pumping system but it was also synchronized with a PV system, as both the PV and the pico-hydro feed into the building's electrical distribution boards,” the research's corresponding author, Sascha Thyer told pv magazine. “Via a switchboard, they were connected to a power control system which could shed load and generation as required. The advantage of this situation is that the PV generates only during the day and the pico-hydro generates continuously, so it could provide a bit of peak load shaving at night time.”
In the paper “Energy recovery in a commercial building using pico-hydropower turbines: An Australian case study,” published in Heliyon, the research group explained that the system was tested in a public aquarium building equipped with a 260 kW PV system originally planned to operate under Australia's feed-in tariff program, a 20 kL thermal energy storage tank, a phase change material (PCM) thermal storage system, and a 90 kWh electrical battery storage system.

The building also uses a filtration system relying on a pumping system that uses seawater. “Since water was returning via gravity to the system, the possibility of recovering surplus energy was identified,” said the scientists.
A power management system was used to carry out peak-shaving, load-shifting and other unspecified energy management algorithms. The team explained that the new PV system configuration does not export any power to the grid, and that the generated electricity is all used at the site.
For the microgrid system, the researchers used a propeller-type turbine, known as PowerSpout LH, which is designed to be completely submerged in water. “The design of the filtration system was adjusted to suit the installation of the pico-hydropower unit, to maximize the available head, support the generators, protect from the harsh tropical environment, and enable safe operation of the equipment,” they stated.
The research group found that the pico hydropower system was able to recover approximately 10% of the energy used for pumping seawater. At a 2.3 m head site and 90 L/s flow, its continuous power output was found to be between 1.04 kW and 1.124 kW and the recovered energy should amount to 9,846 kWh annually. “This is a modest amount of energy, but equivalent to the use of an average Australian household, and an important measure in a suite of measures to reduce energy use of the building overall,” it stressed.
The scientists said the project was economically viable with financial and non-financial benefits for the life cycle of the product. “Considering only electricity cost, the payback time is estimated at 8–10 years for this case,” they concluded. “Considering indirect financial and non-financial benefits the payback time is likely to be significantly less.”

Norway-based renewable energy company Scatec has completed construction on two solar power plants coupled with battey storage in Maroua and Guider, in northern Cameroon.
The two facilities, with a combined 36 MW of PV capacity and 20 MW/19 MWh of storage, feature more than 44,800 bifacial solar panels on trackers, with an estimated annual production of 80 GWh. They were linked to the Northern Interconnected Network (NIN) in collaboration with Eneo Cameroun, the nation's electricity company.
Originally planned as a photovoltaic project in 2019, the two plants saw their capacity gradually increase from 25 MW to 36 MW. Battery storage was added to enhance energy smoothing and facilitate nighttime electricity usage.
The Ministry of Water and Energy said that the solar plants are expected to reduce regional power interruptions by 98% and save fuel expenses. Scatec introduced “Release by Scatec” offer, a rental contract for pre-assembled storage batteries integrated into energy production infrastructure.

The lowest hourly price of ‑€5.74/MWh was reached in the German market on September 19, from 14:00 to 15:00. This price was the lowest since the first half of August in this market.
On the other hand, in the Spanish market, on Sunday, September 24, from 12:00 to 16:00, the price was €0/MWh. In the Italian market, that day, from 13:00 to 15:00, a price of €10.00/MWh was registered, the lowest since May.
During the week of September 18, despite the increase in the average price of gas and CO2 emission rights, the general decline in electricity demand and the significant increase in wind energy production in most of the analyzed markets led to the fall in European electricity market prices.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s price forecasts indicate that in the fourth week of September European electricity market prices might increase, influenced by the decrease in wind energy production, as well as by increases in demand in some markets.

Brent, fuels and CO2
In the third week of September, settlement prices of Brent oil futures for the Front‑Month in the ICE market remained above $93/bbl. The weekly minimum settlement price, $93.27/bbl, was registered on Friday, September 22 and it was 0.7% lower than the previous Friday. On the other hand, the weekly maximum settlement price, $94.43/bbl, was reached on Monday, September 18. This price was 4.2% higher than the previous Monday and the highest since the first half of November 2022.
In the third week of September, production cuts in Saudi Arabia and Russia led Brent oil futures settlement prices to reach values above $93/bbl. However, concerns about the evolution of the economy and expectations of high-interest rates for a longer period of time exerted their downward influence on prices, contributing to their decline during the week.
As for TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front‑Month, on Monday, September 18, they registered a settlement price of €34.47/MWh, 3.8% lower than the previous Monday. But, starting on Tuesday, September 19, prices began to increase. This growing trend continued on Monday, September 25, when a settlement price of €44.44/MWh was reached. This price was 29% higher than that of Monday, September 18, and the highest since the beginning of April.
In the third week of September, the proximity of the coldest months led to an increase in TTF gas futures prices, despite the high levels of European reserves. The alterations in the gas flow from Norway, which will be extended to the month of October, also exerted an upward influence on prices. Meanwhile, the labor conflict at Australian liquefied natural gas export plants continues.
The weekly minimum settlement price for CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market, for the reference contract of December 2023, on Monday, September 18, was registered at €80.84/t. This price was 1.0% lower than the previous Monday and the lowest since early June. However, during the rest of the sessions of the third week of September, prices increased. As a consequence, the weekly maximum settlement price of €85.48/t was reached on Friday, September 22 and it was 3.9% higher than the previous Friday.

Fluke recently acquired Solmetric, a company that combines cutting-edge equipment with industry expertise. pv magazine USA met with Fluke’s Will White at RE+ to explore the company’s new high wattage, current-specific solar module I-V curve tracing hardware.
At the booth, Fluke proudly displayed the PVA-1500HE, formerly Solmetric’s flagship product. The presentation emphasized the 3 primary components of the unit: the I-V unit, the SolSensor, and a user interface that operates on a tablet or laptop. The I-V unit and SolSensor function in tandem, assessing the I-V curve, irradiance, and temperature.

The team at Fluke highlighted a key challenge in testing high-wattage, high-efficiency, and thus high-current solar modules: managing and bleeding off the rush of current that occurs at the onset of a measure, which is driven by the high capacitance of modern solar cells. The acquired Solmetric team, with their refined solution, claims it has solved this challenge. The unit can provide an I-V curve read in milliseconds, a significant improvement over the seconds required for prior test techniques.
The unit is 45 kW, which is double Fluke’s existing 1000V I-V curve testing unit.

 
In addition to the PVA-1500HE, Fluke also now possesses the renowned SunEye, a valuable tool for measuring shade to accurately estimate electricity generation by the modules beyond idealized projections.
In the booth, hardware was only part of the story. Fluke, a recognized name in the testing industry, expressed their enthusiasm about collaboration with the adept team behind this equipment. Solmeric’s specialized knowledge in high-powered equipment testing, particularly for the I-V curve tracer, not only reinforces Fluke’s existing team but also opens doors to explore applications in the EV charging and energy storage sectors.
Patrick Edwards, a Massachusetts Master Electrician and owner of Edwards Electric, told pv magazine USA that he offers IV-curve tracing services in the New England market and said that he is planning to buy the Solmetrix unit for use on a recently contracted portfolio of community solar projects:
“We’ve recently signed a deal to do IV-curve tracing as part of the commissioning process for a series of community solar plants in Maine. All of these sites have high wattage modules, and we need a new testing kit to work with them. I was planning on buying the Solmetrix unit, so I guess I’m buying a Fluke now.”
When asked why he was going with the Solmetrix unit specifically, he said, “I have faith in a product that supplied reliability and accurate testing for as many years as I have been installing and testing.”
Although not yet featured on Fluke’s official webpage, the I-V curve tracing unit remains available on the Solmetric site, ensuring uninterrupted access to this critical tool for industry professionals.
In a broader context, this acquisition is part of Fluke’s consistent endeavor to integrate testing firms into its expansive portfolio. Fluke Reliability, a Fortive subsidiary, recently acquired machine diagnostic company Azima DLI, continuing a trend of adding specialized companies like Raytek, Comark, TTL Technologies, eMaint, Pruftechnik, and Irisys to the Fluke family, enhancing their offerings and reinforcing their industry standing.
Founded in 1948, Fluke’s growth and evolution included acquisition by the Danaher Corporation in 1998 and a subsequent spin-off into Fortive in 2016, marking key milestones in its journey to its current industry leadership position.
