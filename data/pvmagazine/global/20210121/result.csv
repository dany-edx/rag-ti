The biggest statement of intent this morning was made by Newcastle-based private equity group Windel Capital, which said it had signed a deal with Sino-Canadian manufacturer Canadian Solar to “co-develop” a 1.4 GWp solar portfolio in the U.K., with the first sites to be ready to install in the second half of the year.
The press release issued by Windel to announce the arrangement was light on detail but stated the fund would take the 1.4 GWp of projects it has amassed over 18 months to “ready-to-build” status. Indicating Canadian Solar would contribute funding and source power purchase agreements (PPAs), it is presumed Canadian Solar would construct the projects and supply the modules but it was not clear which entity would retain ownership of the projects in question, which could include co-located battery storage facilities, according to Windel.
pv magazine contacted the private equity fund seeking more details about how the project development agreement will work but was told: “The project development agreement is a confidential agreement and as such neither party can release details of how the mechanics work, the press release issued directly by Windel Capital is the approved content for publication.”
Reading-based engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services company Anesco announced separately this morning it had secured a three-year, “more than £100 million” (€113 million) contract to provide EPC and operations and maintenance services on a 200 MW portfolio of 20-50 MW solar projects in the U.K.
The three-year deal for the “shovel-ready” projects will be financed by London-based, sustainability-focused investment fund Gresham House, following the latter's acquisition of a 12 MW, subsidy-free solar project from Anesco last year. The first of the planned solar sites is set to begin construction this year with the full portfolio to be grid connected within three years.
U.K. trade body Solar Energy UK – formerly the Solar Trade Association – said the nation added 545 MW of solar generation capacity last year to take it to a total 13.9 GW, with 60% of the new project capacity ground-mounted and the balance from, mostly commercial and industrial, solar rooftops.
The industry group said the figures it had compiled along with London-based specialist publisher Solar Media Ltd were more accurate than the official government returns which, said Solar Energy UK, lag almost 500 MW behind the real volume.
A bumper year for U.K. solar – despite Covid-19 – saw a record 9.68 GW of solar generation in April and another landmark a month later, when solar supplied 11% of the country's electricity.
Buoyed by the rise of non-subsidized, PPA-driven project capacity, the market could be set for another big year, according to Solar Media head of research Finlay Colville, who said: “The outlook for 2021 and beyond is expected to see continued deployment at the gigawatt-plus level.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/21/rollercoaster-for-the-european-ppa-market-in-2020/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JANUARY 21, 2021",Rollercoaster for the European PPA market in 2020,"From pv magazine Germany
The coronavirus pandemic reached Europe in March 2020 and the market for unsubsidized photovoltaic and wind power plants was suddenly thwarted. After 23 power purchase agreements (PPAs) were signed between January and February, for a total of 2.8 GW, the market came to an almost complete standstill from March, according to the 2021 European PPA Market Outlook produced by Swiss consultancy Pexapark.
Between March and June, only 14 PPAs, for 644 MW of renewable energy projects were closed across Europe. In the second half of the year, however, the PPA market in Europe recovered and picked up significantly, reaching pre-Covid-19 levels at the end of December. Between July and the end of the year, in fact, 33 new corporate PPA deals were sealed for 3.1 GW of photovoltaic and wind power capacity. In December alone, PPAs for 1.1 GW were concluded.
Overall, PPAs for a total renewable energy capacity of 8.9 GW have been signed in Europe to date. However, the Swiss analysts estimate that the actual market volume is likely to be around 10 GW, as not all deals are known. Corporate PPAs account for around 54%, or 4.8 GW, of the total, which represents an increase of almost 70% compared to 2019. The analysts attribute this to the fact that more and more companies want to switch their supply to green electricity and prefer to resort to PPAs for this. Energy companies and traders remain the backbone of the PPA market. Photovoltaic is the leading renewable energy technology, with 4.1 GW of PPAs closed for this technology last year. In regional terms, Spain stands out, with PPAs for a total of 3.4 GW.
The analysis of the prices for the PPAs in Europe is also interesting. The lowest price, of €35/MWh for a solar-linked PPA, was reported in Spain last year. This is followed by Germany, with prices for electricity purchase contracts averaging €41.61/MWh. The PPA contracts concluded in France and Italy were around €1 per megawatt-hour higher, according to Pexapark. The PPAs themselves varied greatly and were largely dependent on the different country circumstances, technologies, and consumers of renewable electricity.
Furthermore, Pexapark indicated several trends that will influence the development of the European PPA market this year. For example, Spain will remain the largest market in Europe in terms of volume, but Germany is pointed out as a potential challenger. The latter, on the other hand, is financially strong and has a large number of professional buyers for electricity from PPA systems – both from a credit perspective and from an industrial perspective. “Provided that the price level for photovoltaic PPAs allows this, this is a market that is ready to take off,” said Pexapark analyst, adding that price volatility will likely persist and with it, the high price pressure on European markets.
In addition, Pexapark expects that there will be a concentration in the PPA market through mergers and acquisitions with energy providers seeking to expand their presence in various regions. Examples are the takeover of Solarcentury by Statkraft, as well as a number of project developers that were bought up by financial investors. Similar activity can also be expected for 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/21/improving-pv-powered-water-electrolysis-with-external-fields/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 21, 2021",Improving PV-powered water electrolysis with external fields,"Scientists from Southern Cross University in Australia are trying to understand the extent to which the use of magnetic fields, light energy fields, ultrasonic fields, or pulsating electric fields could help to improve the efficiency of water electrolysis in solar-powered hydrogen generation plants.
“This study has taken a closer look at these applied fields due to the potential that their efficacy can be further enhanced by considering the molecular dynamics of water molecules,” the researchers said in “Increasing the efficiency of hydrogen production from solar powered water electrolysis,” which was recently published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. “This study also advocates the use of accurate and effective test equipment to help develop a universal approach which would allow future research to be easily evaluated.”
Green hydrogen is currently more expensive the blue hydrogen, and the efficiency of commercially available solar-hydrogen hybrid systems ranges from a minimum of around 2.3% to a maximum of approximately 12%. This low efficiency is generally attributed to efficiency losses in PV generation and the electrolysis cell, power consumption by electronic controls, temperature moderation and ineffective coupling systems between the solar panels and the electrolyzer.
One way to increase the efficiency of solar-powered electrolysis, regardless of the effectiveness of coupling, is to improve the efficiency of electrolysis through the four proposed approaches, which are already known to assist in reducing the formation and flow of oxygen and hydrogen gas bubbles in electrolyzers.
“The main issue reported with bubble evolution is the gas bubbles sticking to the electrodes which causes the bubbles to build-up between the electrodes, resulting in an increase in the ohmic resistance within the electrolyzer,” the Australian group explained, adding that more power consumption is needed to compensate for this resistance.
Magnetic fields
Magnetic fields are produced by electric currents that can be either macroscopic currents in wires or microscopic currents associated with electrons in atomic orbits. These fields are a well-known solution for enabling the desorption of hydrogen from the electrodes and the resulting reduction of the bubble size of the produced gases. Although different explanations have been given for the increased flow rate of hydrogen out of the system, when these fields are applied, the scientists believe that these contradictory findings are possibly the result of different electrolyzer designs.
“Such a difference in design would result in a different interaction between the externally induced magnetic field, the electrodes and the electric field generated within the electrolysis chamber,” they said.
However, the current issues with this approach are the difficulty of using bar magnets in large-scale applications, and the high cost of producing rare earth magnets and generating a magnetic field from an energy source. More research is needed to assess the true efficiency of this approach in improving electrolysis, the researchers said.
Light energy
Green lasers have already been used at the research level to enhance hydrogen generation through light energy, which creates an induced electric field. The lasers have proven to be efficient enough to provide considerable enhancements in the production of the fuel, but the costs of the energy needed to power them may still be too prohibitive to make this technology viable.
Instead, focused sunlight does not need any additional input energy and might represent an interesting alternative.
“The utilization of sunlight energy to enhance hydrogen production in solar-hydrogen hybrid setups would complement such a system if setups incorporated sunlight receivers into photovoltaic panels to induce sunlight into the electrolysis chamber,” the academics said, adding that the real potential benefits of the application of light energy must be thoroughly investigated.
Ultrasonic fields
Ultrasonic fields have been applied with success in improving the efficiency of electrolyzers, showing potential for a 20% increase.
“For example, higher ultrasonic power inputs in some electrolyte concentrations caused gas bubbles to break up into smaller bubbles, resulting in greater bubble adhesion to the electrodes, higher system impedance and an increase in energy consumption,” the researchers said.
However, the energy needed to create the fields is less than the power saved due to the increased efficiency, which currently makes their application to hydrogen unviable. Furthermore, several researchers have shown that the efficiency of the electrolyzer is not always proportional to ultrasonic power input.
“For example, higher ultrasonic power inputs in some electrolyte concentrations caused gas bubbles to break up into smaller bubbles, resulting in greater bubble adhesion to the electrodes, higher system impedance and an increase in energy consumption,” the scientists said, noting that only a few studies have investigated this and other issues related to this external field.
Pulsating electric fields
Pulsating the applied electric field at different intensities and frequencies is another way to improve hydrogen generation. Different theories were outlined to explain why this technique effectively produces an increase in electrolysis efficiency, although no conclusive findings were established.
“As with all applied fields, a disadvantage of applying a pulsating electric field is the cost of system required to generate the pulsating electric field, especially for high frequency electric fields with high power requirements,” the academics explained. “The cost of such equipment also rapidly increases as the power requirements of the equipment increases to meet the needs of scaled-up systems for industrial applications.”
They said that the application has yet to be comprehensively studied. More work is needed to assess the effects of pulsating the applied electric field for water electrolysis.
Water molecule
A look at how these four applied fields interact with molecular movement and the redistribution of molecules in the water during electrolysis could bring us closer to proving their viability, the researcher claimed. In particular, they have looked at the ortho-para conversion of water molecules to understand the movement and reactivity of water.
“Ortho H2O is a term for water molecules that have a spin state due to the energetic moment of each of the hydrogen elements working in conjunction with each other,” they explained. “While para H2O is a term for water molecules that have no spin state due to the energetic moments of the each of the hydrogen elements working in opposite directions.”
The scientists concluded that a deeper understanding of the molecular dynamics of water in electrolysis will be crucial to bringing the proposed four approaches closer to viability.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/21/pv-magazine-award-the-winners/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RACKING,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 21, 2021",pv magazine Award: The Winners,"The 2020 award winners come from companies based in China, Europe, Israel and Australia – demonstrating that innovation within the increasingly global solar industry occurs in all parts of the world. More than 100 Award entrants came from 18 countries, with China (40), Europe (29), and the United States (24) leading the way.
To select our award winners, pv magazine assembled six expert juries, with representatives from throughout the solar world. These independent adjudicators – industry analysts, technologists, researchers, and industry insiders – bring a wealth of experience and close contact to manufacturers and project developers to the process, and the pv magazine editorial team thanks them for their time and for sharing their expertise.
See our January 2021 print edition for a full rundown of the jurors, winners, finalists and commended entries in each category.
High-density modules, packing more cells and having interconnection ribbons on the rear side, have proven an effective method for raising efficiency and increasing power output. Chinese module giant JinkoSolar developed its “tiling ribbon” technology to produce a “high density” module series – the Tiger. The module series employs a special round busbar interconnection technique to achieve cell overlap on each cell’s horizontal edge (see pv magazine 05/2020).
“The technology is really innovative and it can be applied to all sorts of different cells. For example, if Jinko has HJT in the future then it can also use the tiling ribbon,” said juror Jay Lin. Jinko’s Tiger deploys tiling to great effect, packing 156 half cells into the larger module format for utility-scale and C&I roofs, and 132 for the residential segment. Thus, the Tiger achieves 455-475 W from 156 cells and 375-395 W from 132 – both using mono PERC cells. At 21.6% module efficiency, Jinko’s Tiger is no pussycat.
In December 2019, PV panel manufacturer Energetica began producing modules at its fab in Liebenfels, Austria. While initial production is slated at 550 MW per year, it has ambitious plans to ramp up to 1 GW of annual capacity. What makes this manufacturer unique is its sustainable approach – setting a blueprint for other companies to draw inspiration from. Constructed entirely out of wood, the fab itself takes energy from a 2.6 MW rooftop PV system, an adjacent hydropower plant, and wood-fueled (biomass) heating using locally sourced, untreated wood.
“We are particularly impressed by Energetica’s zero-carbon manufacturing,” stated pv magazine’s Sustainability jury. “Most PV modules are essentially dirty glass and can be mechanically recycled, with PV module waste amounting to 0.04% of global glass production in 2019. Energetica has taken steps to choose a more recyclable backsheet, and also uses biodegradable films for packaging.”
Smart home systems have been talked about and to a degree implemented for a few years now. Hitherto, the approach was largely pieced together from various soft- and hardware suppliers. With this product, however, SolarEdge has offered a comprehensive solution to control loads, offer grid support, smart EV charging, and life with the security of backup power. “It offers a pretty comprehensive feature set, controlling the loads and appliances and also including EVs,” says juror Jenya Meydbray. “The 2.0 DC/AC ratio is also very good in terms of DC storage, especially with those power optimizers.”
First launched a couple of years ago, the 5B Maverick is rapidly building a track record of successful installations. A prewired, prefabricated ‘solar block’ that can be folded down, shipped to a site and rolled out, allowing a team of three to install up to 1 MW a week, according to 5B’s estimate.
“I like that it shakes up the ground mount market a bit, by bringing a novel fixed-tilt approach back to the forefront when so many large scale projects use trackers,” says juror Beth Copanas. “As module prices continue to fall and land becomes more constrained, the factory pre-assembled approach coupled with potentially less long-term maintenance than tracking systems, makes this a valuable prospect”
Jolywood is among the first movers bringing TOPCon cell technology to large-scale manufacturing and has already delivered modules featuring this cell to projects the world over. The technology has several inherent advantages over today’s PERC modules, including zero susceptibility to light-induced degradation and a lower temperature coefficient.
“There will be tough competition at gigawatt-scale in the next few years,” warns juror Jonathan Govaerts. “But this cell presents a promising n-type evolution, including large-area IBC approach which will be interesting in the long term.”
A solar hybrid solution with an innovative design and business model, the Jua battery Barrel equipped with its LifePO4 battery pack, allows storage capacity to be increased in 6.3 kWh increments for a one-size-fits-all solution. Its prepackaged design and software-integrated abilities allow fully programmable capabilities to combine different energy sources – grid, PV, batteries, wind – without the need for hardware changes.
“An innovative product designed to allow the quick deployment of systems while maintaining scalability,” says BESS juror Chris Wright. “The hybrid controller that supports integration of solar PV, battery storage, a diesel genset, and flexibility for on-grid or offgrid installations provides substantial flexibility in system configuration and applications.”
The pv magazine Publisher’s Pick award, selected by pv magazine, for 2020 goes to inverter manufacturer Growatt, which celebrated the tenth anniversary of its founding last year. In just 10 years, the company’s founder. David Ding, and his team have built a multinational enterprise with 13 subsidiaries and six large warehouses around the world with regional teams for marketing, technical support, and after-sales service. Growatt invests 10% of its annual revenues in research and development, and 200 of the company’s 1,200 employees are research and development engineers.
There has been much talk about smart homes, but not many easy-to-use integrated solutions have been introduced to date. Growatt’s GroHome system is a true smart home enabler, and as such a trailblazing solution in making the home more energy-efficient and less reliant on external energy sources. Grohome also puts the homeowner front and center as both consumer and “prosumer,” putting a convenient app at his or her fingertips to manage the system and optimize self-consumption. All this is accelerating the energy transition, making Growatt a very worthy recipient of the 2020 pv magazine award in the category “Publisher’s Pick.”

The scheme replaces the pilot scheme for PV micro generation which expired in January 2020, under which 4,353 projects, totaling 15 MW, were implemented, and is expected to come into force in July.
It will be open to both rooftop and small ground-mounted solar, wind, micro-hydro, and micro combined heat and power (CHP) facilities and will enable the system owners to sell excess electricity to the grid. Projects developed under this regime may also have access to the rebate schemes such as the Domestic Solar PV and Better Energy Communities schemes operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, and TAMS II, operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.
Eligible projects must have a minimum self-consumption rate of 70%. “We are developing a micro generation support scheme which will support new micro generation deployment, deliver a route to market for citizens and communities to generate their own renewable electricity, like from solar panels on their roofs, and receive a fair price when they sell the excess into the grid,” said minister Eamonn Ryan.
The consultation process will be closed on February 18.
Ireland has had a limited development of solar energy development to date. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country had only 36 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2019. Fossil fuels still meet around half of Ireland’s power demand.
The Irish government is currently supporting large scale PV through an auction scheme launched at the end of 2019. In the first procurement exercise – launched in April and finalized in August – the Irish authorities allocated 796 MW of solar generation capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/21/the-world-wont-wait-biden-needs-to-catch-up/,"EMPLOYMENT,GEOPOLITICS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,CHINA,EUROPE,JAPAN,UNITED STATES",,"JANUARY 21, 2021",The world won’t wait – Biden needs to catch up,"Newly-inaugurated Joe Biden said one of his first executive orders as president of the USA would be to sign the country back into the Paris Agreement – the global commitment within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which deals with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change adaptation and finance, initially signed in 2016.
He was as good as his word on that pledge yesterday and with media outlets reporting he would also cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline – planned to transfer Canadian tar-sand oil to Nebraska – on his first day in office, Biden did not disappoint. Tar sands are considered the world’s dirtiest fossil fuel and the Keystone pipeline sparked great controversy.
The sheer scale of the United States, whether ranked by size of population, economy or greenhouse gas emissions, means such decisions have a global impact.
In May, for example, the statistical office of the European Union published a document which stated that, in 2017, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the EU's 27 member states represented 16% of the global figure – expressed through the purchasing power standards unit used to level currency and price differences across the bloc. China and the United States were the two largest economies by that measure, with 16.4% and 16.3% of the global mix, respectively. Eight-month-old data may seem old but they were also the latest figures published by the global office of the International Comparison Program at the World Bank.
Of course, while the USA and China are about the same size for GDP in purchasing power standard terms, their respective GDP per capita figures differ markedly. Thus, according to the same dataset, in 2017 the shares of the USA, the EU – minus the U.K. – and China of global GDP in euros were 24.5%, 18.5% and 15.2%, respectively. 
Similarly, when considering emissions, according to the Our World in Data website which provides statistics related to the world’s most pressing problems, the USA scored the highest share of global, cumulative CO2 emissions. Specifically, says the site, the USA, EU27 and China contributed 25.11%, 17.3% and 13.07% of the world’s CO2 emissions in 2018. 
Having the USA rejoin the Paris Accord matters.
What differs, though, from the past, is that in policy terms, and regarding the world’s effort to embrace new-energy technologies, the USA has lost its leadership. 
Last year was an astonishing 12 months – and not just in public health terms – with net-zero carbon ambitions stated by China and Japan pivotal policy statements.
In September, China’s president, Xi Jinping, said the country planned “to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.” The announcement took the world by surprise, however it also demonstrated China’s desire to become a global leader in both climate and technology policy, ensuring the nation’s continuous growth.
And if China’s announcement was not enough, the international climate action movement gathered additional momentum weeks later, when Japan’s government announced it would cut emissions to net zero by 2050.
Our World in Data figures attest Japan had a 3.97% share of the world’s CO2 emissions in 2018. The nation had the fifth largest share of global GDP in purchasing power standard terms – 4.3% – according to that EU study in May.
The two Asian superpowers have a climate policy ally in the EU. The European Council of Ministers in December 2019 approved a climate neutrality goal for 2050 and in March the EU formally submitted its long-term strategy to the UNFCCC, based on several scenarios for a mid-century vision.
The EU’s net-zero target for 2050 received an impressive boost in July, when the national leaders who make up the European Council approved the creation of a €750 billion Covid recovery fund that will mostly need to be spent on climate neutral projects and green growth. 
The USA lacks a net zero goal at present and even after rejoining the Paris Accord, Trumpism and its associated climate change skepticism will continue to be present in U.S. society. 
The 46th President of the United States will need to make the case for climate action and green growth very strongly to the American people and will try to show them the example set by the EU, China and Japan. 
And even if the USA does not grasp the significance of the shift to climate-friendly technology, the world appears to have already embraced the change – and the job creation and development prospects that come with it. For once, America needs to look to the rest of the world and learn. The world would welcome such a move – but won’t wait eternally for it.

By comparison, newly deployed PV systems hit 2.57 GW in 2019, 1.69 GW in 2018, and 853 MW in 2017. Of the new capacity installed last year, around 1.09 GW came in the form of residential installations – up from 873 MW a year earlier. The remaining 1.8 GW of capacity came from the commercial and industrial and large-scale market segments.
The consultancy reported that around 5 GW of the PV projects that are being developed under the SDE+ scheme for utility-scale renewables are already operational. Another 16 GW of projects are currently under development or construction, it added. In addition, it revealed that all grid-connected PV systems generated around 7.92 TWh last year, which was enough to cover approximately 6.6% of total electricity demand.
The Netherlands could reach between 38 GW and 125 GW of total installed solar capacity by 2050, according to a recent report by Netbeheer Nederland, the Dutch association of national-regional electricity and gas network operators. In another report released in November 2019, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) predicted that the country could rise to 36 GW of installed solar power by 2030. In October 2017, Energieonderzoek Centrum Nederland issued a forecast under which the nation's total installed PV capacity could grow to 20 GW by 2035.

Canada also will buy Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) from new clean energy generation in Canada, a move intended to enable Canada to attribute its energy consumption as clean in regions where new clean renewable sources are not yet available.
The government’s combined electricity consumption includes roughly 532,000 MWh annually from greenhouse gas-emitting sources of electricity. Federal buildings in Alberta consume 31% of that total. Another 23% is consumed elsewhere in Canada where local clean electricity initiatives will not be available in the near term.
Together, the contracts issued through the RFP will help Canada cut its greenhouse gas footprint by around 133 kilotonnes or 56% of total real property emissions in Alberta. The contracts also are expected to displace on the order of 41 kilotonnes of greenhouse gas emissions from electricity use in the rest of Canada.
The approach will use one or more Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with clean electricity generators. These PPAs will secure renewable electricity by using funds that the government already spends on utility bills.
The Government of Canada’s Clean Electricity Initiative plans to use 100% clean electricity by 2022, where available.

Researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and the University of Sydney (USYD) have put their big heads together and managed to produce ‘green’ ammonia from air, water, and solar energy in a fashion that does not also require high temperatures, high pressure, and enormous amounts of infrastructure. The researchers believe the new production method, which has so far only been demonstrated in a lab, could play a role in the global transition to a hydrogen economy. 
Ammonia, a hydrogen product, is currently used mainly in the fertilizer industry, but could play a pivotal role in the evolving hydrogen economy, particularly as a shipping fuel in its liquefied form. This, says Rystad Energy’s head of global energy systems, Marius Foss, is for the simple reason that ammonia can be safely liquefied at only 33 C – making it much easier and more efficient to store and transport than H2. 
However, the traditional way to make ammonia, the Haber-Bosch process, is only cost-effective at enormous scale, expense and emissions. “The current way we make ammonia via the Haber-Bosch method produces more CO2 than any other chemical-making reaction. In fact, making ammonia consumes about 2 percent of the world’s energy and makes 1 percent of its CO2 – which is a huge amount if you think of all the industrial processes that occur around the globe,” says UNSW’s School of Chemical Engineering lecturer Emma Lovell.
Lovell added that the carbon footprint of the Haber-Bosch process is amplified because such a large-scale project requires a centralized location, which necessarily entails a great deal of global transportation. Moreover, as was shown with the catastrophic ammonium nitrate explosion at a warehouse in Beirut last year, storing large amounts of ammonia in one place is very dangerous.  
However, Lovell and her team have found a way to produce ammonia cheaply, locally, and cleanly. Indeed, Lovell believes that once the technology is available commercially, farmers will be able to produce their own green ammonia to make fertilizer on site. 
“So if we can make it locally to use locally, and make it as we need it, then there’s a huge benefit to society as well as the health of the planet,” says Lovell.
Fourth state 
The key to this breakthrough is found in the fourth state of matter – plasma. According to ARC DECRA fellow and research co-author, Ali Jalili, converting atmospheric nitrogen (N2) directly to ammonia using electricity “has posed a significant challenge to researchers for the last decade, due to the inherent stability of N2 that makes it difficult to dissolve and dissociate.”
However, by using plasma (a form of lightning in a tube) Jalili and his colleagues were able to convert air into an intermediary called NOx (either NO2 or NO3) which is more reactive than N2 in the air. 
“Once we generated that intermediary in water, designing a selective catalyst and scaling the system became significantly easier,” says Jalili. “The breakthrough of our technology was in the design of the high-performance plasma reactors coupled with electrochemistry.”
Solar-powered storage 
The team of researchers may have solved the problem of storing and transporting hydrogen. Rose Amal, a professor at UNSW and the ARC Training Centre for Global Hydrogen Economy, said that hydrogen requires an exceptional amount of space for storage, “otherwise you have to compress or liquify it.”
“But liquid ammonia actually stores more hydrogen than liquid hydrogen itself, and so there has been increasing interest in the use of ammonia as a potential energy vector for a carbon-free economy,” says Amal. 
This is all to say that allied with this technological breakthrough, ammonia could be made from solar energy and be essentially ready for export.
“We can use electrons from solar farms to make ammonia and then export our sunshine as ammonia rather than hydrogen,” concludes Amal. “And when it gets to countries like Japan and Germany, they can either split the ammonia and convert it back into hydrogen and nitrogen, or they can use it as a fuel.”

In one of his first official acts, U.S. President Joe Biden signed executive orders this week to rejoin the Paris climate agreement and block the construction of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline.
The Oval Office event was Biden’s first major action to tackle global warming as he brings the largest team of climate change experts ever into the White House. During his presidential campaign, Biden had laid out plans to roll back a number of the Trump administration’s environmental and energy policies.
Return to Paris
Former President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, a non-binding global accord to address the threat of climate change, in 2017. Trump argued that the U.S. commitments were unfair, unnecessary, and costly.
Absent action on the federal level, a coalition of state governors and local leaders worked to support the international deal’s goals. Following Biden’s executive order, clean energy groups applauded the planned U.S. return to the Paris Agreement and said they’re looking forward to working with the new administration to combat climate change.
Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy, commended Biden’s “commitment to move America beyond climate denial on his very first day in office.” Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the industry “stands ready to help America meet its commitments in the Paris Agreement.”
Goodbye, Keystone
Biden also signed an executive order revoking the existing presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. The cross-border oil pipeline project between Canada and the United States has faced strong opposition from environmental and Indigenous groups for years. Former President Barack Obama rejected the project. In 2017, however, Trump issued a presidential permit to help move the stalled project forward, citing energy independence and job creation.
In a statement, Keystone XL developer TC Energy Corp. called Biden’s plan to scrap the permit “very disappointing.” The Canadian company claimed that the decision could lead to thousands of job losses, adding that the it is assessing its options and suspending the project.
In the lead-up to Biden’s inauguration, TC Energy announced plans to make the Keystone project the “first pipeline to be fully powered by renewable energy.” As part of the initiative, the company said its commitment would spur up to $1.7 billion in investment and create 1.6 GW of renewables.
According to a Reuters report, Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently signaled his continued support for the Keystone pipeline, telling reporters, “our government is making sure that Canada’s views are heard and considered.”
Environmental groups have praised Biden. Catherine Collentine, associate director of the Sierra Club’s Dirty Fuels Campaign, called the Keystone Xl rejection “a huge and hard-fought victory for our communities, clean water, and climate.” Mitchell Bernard, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Biden’s “swift and decisive” actions on the pipeline and Paris Agreement make “the United States once more part of the global climate solution – not the problem.”
Climate team
The White House climate team is led by Gina McCarthy, the former administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The new climate team includes the following people:
