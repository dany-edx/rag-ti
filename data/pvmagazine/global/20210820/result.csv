The government of the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia has approved a power project that will use solar and wind to produce green hydrogen, Bloomberg Green reported. According to the article, Inner Mongolia's Energy Administration has approved a plan to deploy to a cluster of plants in the cities of Ordos and Baotou. Overall, these plants will have a solar capacity of 1.85 GW and wind capacity of 370 and will be able produce 66,900 tons of green hydrogen a year. “Development will begin in October and the projects will be operational in mid-2023, the association said, without specifying the cost or the developers,” the article reads.
Researchers from the Monash University in Australia are looking at ways to produce hydrogen energy more sustainably through repurposing wastewater, the Australian public research university wrote on Thursday. “At least 5.5 billion litres of water is needed annually to achieve the hydrogen production target proposed in Australia's National Hydrogen Strategy for the estimated 2030 export market, which is equivalent to the annual water consumption of 1.6 million people,” reads the press release. The team is developing an approach that repurposes wastewater generated in Australia's major capital cities, minimizing freshwater consumption. “Most of the treated water throughout Australia is currently discharged to surrounding water bodies or recycled for irrigation after being treated in centralised municipal wastewater treatment plants. Given the volume of the treated water from these plants is highly consistent, it is a promising water source for water electrolysis,” said Chemical Engineering Professor and Director of the ARC Research Hub for Energy-efficient Separation, Xiwang Zhang. The project team will be working closely with national water utility companies Southeast Water, Melbourne Water, Yarra Valley Water, and Water Corporation, through Water Research Australia (WaterRA). “There still remains a knowledge gap in how the impurities affect water electrolyser design and process operation. Through this research we hope to develop an in-depth understanding of the impacts of water impurities in used water on the performance and durability of water electrolysers, and subsequently develop guidelines for the design of highly durable water electrolysers and the operation and upgrade of existing wastewater treatment plants,” said Arash Zamyadi from WaterRA.
Energy storage and clean fuel company ITM Power officially opened ITM Power's new factory at Bessemer Park in Sheffield, which the company called the world's largest electrolyzer factory. “ITM Power's Gigafactory, with a capacity of 1,000 MW (1GW) of electrolysis equipment per annum, commenced operation in January this year. The site already employs some 320 people with further staff additions planned as the facility ramps up to capacity,” the company said.
South Korea's automobile parts maker Hyundai Mobis reportedly said it would invest 1.32 trillion won (US$1.1 billion) in two local hydrogen fuel-cell plants by 2025. The local news agency Yonhap wrote that Hyundai Mobis plans to build a hydrogen fuel-cell stack plant in Incheon, just west of Seoul, and a hydrogen fuel-cell systems assembly plant in Ulsan, 414 kilometers southeast of Seoul. The country is also researching a concept to develop an offshore green hydrogen model through a consortium focused on floating hydrogen production offshore plants (H-FPSO), and collaborating with foreign companies. On Wednesday, for instance, Loop Energy, a Canadian developer and manufacturer of hydrogen fuel cell-based solutions, said the “placement of the order for the first eFlow powered Hydrogen Fuel Cell Systems under a commercial agreement with NGVI, a South Korean-based manufacturer of turn-key compressed natural gas and hydrogen fuel systems for transit and coach bus applications.”
German gas and oil producer Wintershall Dea and Leipzig-based natural gas company VNG plan to build a facility to produce climate-friendly ‘turquoise' hydrogen as the first step of their long-term collaboration. “The thermal methane pyrolysis process used by HiiROC, in which both companies recently invested, is to be used and further developed for a specific application together with the facility manufacturer. According to current plans, the pilot facility will go into operation in 2023 and will have a nominal capacity of 400kg of hydrogen per day (equivalent to an annual energy output of almost 5 GWh). “This will make the facility the first of its kind to produce so-called turquoise hydrogen in Germany,” the companies said in a statement, noting that they have already jointly made an initial investment in England-based HiiROC to develop methane pyrolysis technology. “This cooperation with VNG will help realise the technology's potential and establish a hydrogen market, because markets don't happen by themselves. They have to be built and organised – technology neutral,” said Hugo Dijkgraaf, Chief Technology Officer at Wintershall Dea.
The British government awarded funding for four projects through the Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC) Collaborative Research and Development competition, which supports the development of innovative low carbon automotive technology. Among them there is the Brunel project in Darlington, which secured £14.6 million to develop a novel zero-emission, hydrogen-fueled engine to help decarbonize heavy goods vehicles. “This project will significantly accelerate the pace of hydrogen engine development, ensuring that the UK is in the vanguard of this exciting new technology which will play a significant part in de-carbonising the global commercial vehicle fleet,” Jonathan Atkinson, Executive Director of Cummins On-highway Business in Europe, said on Wednesday. The other selected projects are REEcorner in Nuneaton (£41.2 million to redesign light and medium-sized commercial electric vehicles), BMW-UK-BEV in Oxford (£26.2 million to develop an electric battery), and Celeritas in Birmingham (£9.7 million to create ultra-fast charging batteries).

Hong Kong-listed footwear company Golden Solar New Energy Technology last week announced commercial production plans for the flexible, lightweight, cast-mono, heterojuntion (HJT) solar module it has developed. The company, formerly Baofeng Modern International, cited potential applications on sunshades, gas stations, and sheds and said it plans to integrate the products with the batteries it manufactures, as part of home solar systems. The slippers and sandals maker plans to transform into a solar company after developing what it says are more than 24% efficient HJT solar cells and has already signed agreements to purchase casting silicon furnaces from GCL-Poly Energy and to lease 500 MW of HJT cell production equipment from GS-Solar (Fujian) Co Ltd. The newly-announced flexible cell plans prompted Golden Solar on Monday to tear up a proposed convertible bonds issuance which would have seen investment holding company D&A Performance inject HK$100 million (US$12.8 million) into the business to back its solar transformation.
Solar manufacturer Solargiga yesterday announced a turnaround in its fortunes with the news it expects to follow-up the RMB42.7 million net loss recorded in the first six months of last year with a RMB115-125 million (US$17.7-19.3 million) profit this time around, thanks to an increase in the company’s production capacity.
China Power has stated it is on track to have clean power plants make up more than half its generation portfolio this year, and to become the first major Chinese utility to have more renewable energy than coal-fired facilities. Publishing its first-half figures yesterday, the electric company said the RMB1.52 billion (US$234 million) revenue generated by its solar plants in the first six months of the year led to a RMB412 million ($63.5 million) profit, whereas the RMB10.3 billion ($1.59 billion) revenue posted by its coal fleet had driven profits of only RMB168 million ($25.9 million).

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/20/conical-roof-equipped-with-solar-tiles/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"AUGUST 20, 2021",Conical roof equipped with solar tiles,"From pv magazine Germany
A solar system comprising PV tiles has been deployed on the conical roof of the Artefact – Center for Sustainable Development in Glücksburg at the Baltic Sea in Germany this summer.
The PV tiles were provided by German specialist Autarq and have been installed everywhere on the roof except for the north side. They were placed on top of clay bricks supplied by roof tile company Creaton.
Werner Kiwitt, Managing Director of Artefact GmbH, had been looking for suitable solar roof tiles for the building's conference and guest center for almost three years and aimed to find a single source for the purchase, installation, and warranty of the PV system. “The roofs next to the conical roof are green. Therefore, aesthetics also played a role in the decision in favor of Autarq solar roof tiles,” said Kiwitt
The tiles resemble classic slate roof tiles. “The center will use the solar power generated entirely for its own consumption,” Kiwitt continued. “A battery storage system and inverter are located in a room below the newly covered roof.”
The conference center doesn't just rely on clean electricity – it already completely covers its heat demand with solar thermal energy and biomass.
Autarq said its solar roof tiles are less sensitive to shading due to a parallel connection. According to the manufacturer, the roof statics are not affected either, since the weight of the solar roof tiles is roughly the same as that of the original tiles. Cables and plug contacts are located under the roof cladding and are thus protected against the effects of the weather.
“Each tile has an output of 10 W,” an Autarq spokeswoman told pv magazine, adding that the cost per tile is currently €24.60.

The devices that are used in these kinds of networks are mostly wireless sensors, control systems, and technologies for home and building automation, all of which require smart, efficient, and cheap forms of power.
Scientists from the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have tested the ability of three different solar module technologies to power Internet-of-Things devices such as wireless temperature sensors.
The group tested, in particular, three mini-modules made with 12 individual 2 cm × 2 cm solar cells relying on silicon, gallium indium phosphide (GaInP), and gallium arsenide (GaAs), respectively, that were custom-built for low light energy harvesting. The three devices have a power conversion efficiency of 9.3%, 23.1% and 14.1%, respectively.
The panels were used to charge low-capacity batteries powering the sensors. “For all three cell technologies, three cells were wired in series and four columns of such cells were connected in parallel to provide the voltage required to satisfy the charging circuit's minimum voltage requirement,” it stated. “The substrate that holds the cells is a printed circuit board (PCB) with a pair of gold-coated copper contacts for each cell.”
The modules were placed underneath a warm white light-emitting diode (LED), housed inside an opaque black box to block out external light sources, which generated light at a fixed intensity of 1,000 lux, comparable to light levels in a well-lit room. The rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have a maximum charge voltage of 4.2 V, a nominal charge capacity of 40 mAh and are designed for 3.6 V operation. “The circuit is designed with a capacitor to supply the burst current at the output pin to charge the battery,” the U.S. group said.
The measurements showed that the GaInP panel was able to supply the most power to the circuit, at 3.05 mW, while the GaAs and silicon panel provided 1.34 mW and 1.36 mW, respectively. The GaInP module was also able to charge the battery in the least amount of time, followed by the GaAs and silicon modules.
Despite its poor performance, the research group decided to conduct a second experiment on the silicon panel, given its lower costs compared to the other two technologies, and sought to understand if these devices may be suitable for low-demand IoT devices. The mini-module was linked to a wireless temperature sensor with lower power requirements and placed under the same illumination conditions as the previous experiment. When the sensor was turned on, powered by the PV panel, it became able to feed temperature readings wirelessly to a computer nearby.
After two hours, the light in the black box was switched off and the sensor continued to run. The battery, meanwhile, depleted at half the rate it took to be charged. “Even with a less efficient mini-module, we found that we could still supply more power than the wireless sensor consumed,” said NIST researcher, Andrew Shore. “We're turning on our lights all the time and as we move more toward computerized commercial buildings and homes, PV could be a way to harvest some of the wasted light energy and improve our energy efficiency.”
The findings of the experiment can be found in the paper Indoor light energy harvesting for battery-powered sensors using small photovoltaic modules, published in Energy Science & Engineering.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/20/india-sees-renewable-energy-investments-increase-between-april-and-july/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 20, 2021",India sees renewable energy investments increase between April and July,"From pv magazine India
The Indian renewable energy sector is seeing a rise in investment again following a 24% year-on-year decline in FY2020-21 due to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a new briefing note issued by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
In the first four months of this financial year (FY), from April to July 2021, investment in the Indian renewable energy sector reached US$6.6 billion, surpassing the $6.4 billion level for FY2020-21 and on track to quickly overtake the $8.4 billion total achieved in 2019-20 before the pandemic.
“Rebounding energy demand and a surge of commitments from banks and financial institutions to exit fossil fuel financing are helping to drive investment into Indian renewable energy infrastructure,” said author Vibhuti Garg, Energy Economist, Lead India at IEEFA.
The IEEFA note explores renewable energy investment trends during FY2020-21 and for the first four months of FY2021-22 and also highlights the key deals made during both periods. 
The majority of the money flowed through acquisitions, which helps to recycle the capital into new projects. The largest of around 30 deals during FY2020-21 and April to July FY2021-22 was SoftBank’s exit from the Indian renewable energy sector in May 2021 with a $3.5 billion sale of assets to Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL). With this acquisition, AGEL became a major investor as well as the world’s largest solar developer.
Other key deals included Engie’s acquisition by Edelweiss Infrastructure Yield Plus for $550 million, Acme’s acquisition by Scatec Solar for $400 million, and Fortum’s acquisition by Actis for $333 million.
The majority of the other big deals were said to be packaged as debt, equity investment, green bonds, and mezzanine funding.
Indian renewable energy developers are attracting huge investments from green bonds, said co-author Saurabh Trivedi, Research Analyst at IEEFA. “In April 2021, ReNew Power raised money from green bonds with a tenor of 7.25 years at a fixed interest rate of 4.5% per annum, and this was soon trumped in August 2021 by the $414 million 2026 green bond issue by Azure Power Global at a record low 3.575% per year.”
In the latest development, a mega $8 billion special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transaction between ReNew Power and RMG Acquisition Corporation II received approval from a majority of shareholders, paving the way for a Nasdaq listing with expected trading from 24 August 2021. “This is a landmark transaction as it represents the biggest overseas listing of an Indian company via the SPAC route,” said Trivedi.
IEEFA analysts note the government is redoubling its efforts to boost energy security and self-reliance by expanding clean energy technologies as demonstrated by Prime Minister Modi’s Independence Day speech, and Indian corporates like Reliance and JSW Energy, which are making big clean energy commitments.
In addition, the lending portfolios of Indian financial institutions like the State Bank of India (SBI) and Power Finance Corporation (PFC) now include more renewable energy assets than fossil fuels – a trend that picked up significantly in the last one to two years.
In a February 2021 report, IEEFA highlighted that India would require a further $500 billion in investment in new wind and solar infrastructure, energy storage, and grid expansion and modernization to reach 450 GW of capacity by 2030.
“The decarbonization of the energy sector will demand massive amounts of investment, and the flow of capital into this space will need to accelerate rapidly to meet India’s clean energy targets and enable a green recovery towards a sustainable economy,” said Garg.
India is currently investing around $18-20 billion in energy generation capacity and a further $20 billion in the grid on an annual basis. To achieve the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) in the International Energy Agency’s India Energy Outlook 2021, the country would need to triple its current rate of annual investment to $110 billion.
“This is daunting in one respect,” said Garg. “But the financial trends in Indian renewable energy and grid infrastructure over the last two to three years strongly suggest domestic and global capital can support this ambition.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/20/cigs-solar-module-for-high-altitude-airship-applications/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 20, 2021",Ultra-lightweight CIGS solar module for high altitude airship applications,"U.S.-based CIGS thin film module manufacturer, Ascent Solar, has recently developed a 25 W laminated PV module that can be used in large unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), high-altitude lighter-than-air (LTA) vehicles, and fixed-wing aircraft.
The new product, dubbed HL 25 HyperLight, has been designed as a modular power system component with a size of 919 x 316 x 0.26 mm and a weight of just 82 grams, including a bypass diode within the package that protects each of the two series strings. A small 300 W array made of these panels would weigh in at around 1 kg.
The nominal voltage of the panel is 40 V and the current at maximum power is 0.7 A. The short-circuit current is 0.8 A and the open-circuit voltage 52 V. Its power conversion efficiency is 11%, with near-term efficiency improvement plans in the works, according to the manufacturer. “The potential for CIGS to be used in conjunction with new tandem/hybrid devices including perovskite, and as a mechanism for facilitating novel technologies such as wireless power-beaming, makes it the ideal platform for sustained PV technology innovations,” said Ascent Solar.
The modules, according to the manufacturer, can be connected with traditional aerospace methods such as spot welding and soldering, and each include a bypass diode covering each 20 V string in the laminate to facilitate easier integration.
The manufacturer uses a roll-to-roll manufacturing process that is said to be capable of high-speed production leveraging a 25 inch polyimide substrate, which is then combined with Ascent's patented monolithic-integration patterning process. “This process provides our customers with the lightest, most flexible, highly-rugged PV material able to withstand the harshest environments, such as bullet-holes, micro-meteorites, and harsh temperature and radiation situations,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The panel is designed to operate at air mass zero (AM0), which is the standard spectrum outside the Earth's atmosphere. For example, in May Ascent Solar announced a module order from an unspecified customer that is developing an unmanned, helium-filled airship operating in the stratosphere at an altitude greater than 60,000 feet above sea level.
According to the company, the light weight of the module is highly advantageous in the space and aerospace sectors, as mass constitutes one of the biggest launch costs and payload mass limiters in space flight planning today. “The 300+ W/kg specific power will allow for increased flight-planning and operational resilience, while also accommodating the typical hazards of launch and space-environment scenarios, providing for optimal overall operational efficiency,” continued the spokesperson.
Ascent Solar is based in Denver, Colorado, United States. “Our manufacturing capacity is being planned to accommodate needs in our focus sectors projected to increase into the hundreds of megawatts over the next 5 years,” the spokesperson concluded.

Lithium-based energy storage volumes deployed to the United States will grow by multiple orders of magnitude in the coming years, with a 1,000% capacity increase over the next two years projected in a recent government report. That rate of growth may well be an underestimate, given current market trends.
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration released the third edition of its U.S. Battery Storage Market Trends report, covering a mix of energy storage information from the end of 2019, and 2020, with projections through 2023.
The EIA noted that as of the end of 2020, 74% of the nation’s slightly more than 1 GW/1.8 GWh of energy storage was deployed in five states. California contributed 31% of that total. Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Hawaii accounted for more than 50 MW of capacity each. The report predicted a rapidly growing, evolving market as a result of consecutive reductions in future pricing.
As of the end of 2019, it was clear that market location was driving energy storage installation techniques.
In PJM territory, batteries are most often used for ancillary services, so installations tended to be “power oriented,” delivering a higher instantaneous power output for a shorter duration. Installations in the power grid region had an average power capacity of 10.8 MW, and an average energy capacity of 6.8 MWh, meaning an average duration of 45 minutes.
In California, batteries were being used primarily for stability. The state’s batteries had an average power capacity of 4.7 MW, and an average energy capacity of 14.4 MWh, making for an average duration of just over 3.0 hours.
The longer hour pattern has continued in California, with a recent announcement noting that 2 GW of energy storage power capacity was due online by the end of August. Most of that will be coupled to 4 hours of energy capacity.
Going forward, the volumes are growing with at least a 1,000% capacity growth over 2019 numbers expected.
Project developers had reported to the EIA that they planned to install over 10 GW of large-scale battery storage power capacity between 2021 and 2023. While the EIA doesn’t publish forward-looking energy capacity volumes due to privacy requests by developers, WoodMac Renewables & Power has suggested that around 12 GWh of capacity is on track to be installed in 2021.
The report noted that California accounts for 40% of power capacity planned between 2021 and 2023. These planned additions put California in line to meet its energy storage requirement by 2024.
California will already have 2 GW of energy storage power online by the end of August. Given the state’s power grid challenges, expectations are that the state’s storage capacity will continue to grow very aggressively, blowing past their legal requirements.
The EIA report also said that greater than 70% of the energy storage to be deployed is slated to be coupled with solar power. This would increase the current volume co-located with electricity generation from 30% to 60%.
Current tax law makes it so that coupling solar power and energy storage gets a 26% tax credit and accelerated depreciation (roughly another 17% of project costs) applied to the energy storage if the solar power is used to charge the batteries.
Industry has been pushing for its own energy storage tax credit that would decouple the solar+storage relationship, at least financially. Recent reporting by the National Renewable Energy Lab shows that coupling storage with a standard solar installation produces only modest price savings, if any.

Around 2.1 GW of solar projects representing a total investment of about $2.2 billion on a payroll of 3,000 construction workers is at risk as U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) enforces action to stop the flow of goods that may have been produced using forced labor in China’s Xinjiang region.
Philip Shen, an analyst with Roth Capital Partners, offered those numbers and said that JinkoSolar has had 100 MW of modules detained by customs agents and that the company is “not able to ship from Malaysia to the U.S.”
In addition, Trina Solar had six next-generation test modules detained and Canadian Solar had four modules detained. The Canadian Solar modules may have been headed for the Solar Power International trade show in September in New Orleans.
pv magazine has learned independently that all three companies have had products detained by border agents.
