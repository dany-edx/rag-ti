A potential bidding war for the rest of the decade, in which Chinese recyclers are expected to hold all the cards, has been predicted by U.S.-owned analyst Wood Mackenzie which, in a note issued yesterday, again stressed the importance of North America and Europe establishing their own battery manufacturing supply chains.
With recyclers around the world announcing plans to ramp up their capacities “quite aggressively,” according to Verisk-owned WoodMac, a lack of end-of-life products is likely to see the industry starved of feedstock.
As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing for the energy storage industry. Read about lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
Though EV rates are rising rapidly, the long life of batteries is likely to cause “a scramble” among recyclers for products to work with. In such a scenario, recycling facilities based near battery manufacturing plants will have the upper hand, as Chinese recyclers currently do. At present, said WoodMac in a press release yesterday, “Chinese recyclers benefit from greater integration with nearby cathode production plants, so [they] can regularly bid much higher prices for used batteries than their Western counterparts.”
Unless North America and Europe establish their own EV battery supply chains, warned WoodMac, “China will remain the most appealing location for battery recycling.” If that happens, research analyst Max Reid said, only the biggest of new entrants into the battery recycling sector outside China are likely to survive long enough to reap the longer term rewards of the EV transition.
The expected scramble for dead batteries could at least drive more value into the products. Right now, it is cheaper and faster to manufacture new EV batteries than to recycle them and producers are focusing on ever cheaper raw materials.
The analyst said a new battery cathode plant, for example, can churn out 50 kilotons per year of materials for NMC (nickel-manganese-cobalt) batteries, enough to kit out 400,000 EVs. The typical battery recycling facility, however, only produces 5-10 kilotons per year – the equivalent of 30,000 devices.
With battery companies exploring new technology, such as solid-state devices, the recycling industry could be about to get even more complex, as WoodMac's Reid pointed out when he said: “This decade will see the [new battery] supply chain further establish itself to be able to supply vast quantities of battery-grade chemicals and cathodes to cell manufacturers whilst recyclers will struggle with the large mass and complexity of EV packs.”

And even once they have chosen one to work with, scientists need to understand its interactions with the other materials present, and the effects of changing parameters such as layer thickness, dopant concentration and a wealth of others in order to get the best out of the cells they are working on.
With so many possibilities, this can be a time-consuming process. And scientists today are increasingly able to turn to artificial intelligence to guide them in the next steps to take in practical lab work. And developing a system to do just that for solar cell design was the focus of a group of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who worked with experts at Google Brain to develop a system to evaluate the potential of different solar cell designs, and also predict which changes would provide improved performance characteristics. “We developed a tool that will enable others to discover more quickly other higher performance devices,” explained MIT researcher Giuseppe Romano. “Our tool can identify a unique set of material parameters that has been hidden so far because it's very complex to run those simulations.”
The model is described in the paper ∂PV: An end-to-end differentiable solar-cell simulator, published in Computer Physics Communications. With data on a solar cell configuration, it outputs a predicted efficiency, and shows which of the input parameters affects the prediction the most. It can evaluate multiple variables for each layer including doping concentration, dielectric constant and bandgap. And its researchers point to layer thickness as a particularly important variable. “…the thickness is critical,” said MIT scientist Sean Mann. “There is a strong interplay between light propagation and the thickness of each layer and the absorption of each layer.”
MIT is making the model available as an open-source tool that can be taken up by researchers and industry. According to the institute, it is ready to be combined with other algorithms and machine learning processes to quickly assess many possible changes to device design and pull out those with the most potential.
And since it is based on open-source code, future users will be able to optimize it further for more complex cell architecture, such as tandem and multijunction devices. The current version, “can cover the majority of cells that are currently under production, and there are ways to approximate a tandem solar cell by simulating each of the individual cells,” said Romano. “But once it’s up there, the community can contribute to it, and that’s why we are really excited.”

The concept of D4R is a design principle that takes into account the recyclability of a product, including end-of-life considerations, at an early life cycle stage. “A D4R approach can exchange the present, rudimentary and detrimental panel shredding technique [with] sophisticated dismantling,” the scientists explained. “Key technology of the D4R approach, is a novel encapsulant with an integrated trigger mechanism for material separation at end of life.”
The encapsulant consists of adhesive foil that can be embedded in the solar cells in a photovoltaic panel. The module is being developed with the support of Dutch backsheet provider Endurans Solar, Netherlands-based brazing and soldering technology provider Mat-Tech, and Dutch module manufacturer Exasun, under the umbrella of the Parsec project.
“It would not necessarily add costs as it can be used in combination with standard factory lamination for the production of PV panels,” TNO researcher Martin Späth, told pv magazine.
Endurance created two different encapsulants for the panel– one for the front of the module. which joins the glass and cells together; and a slightly different formulation for the back of the module, which attaches cells and backsheet together. “The key point is that our encapsulant is a unique adhesive film based on hot-melt technology that enables the individual materials of the module to be separated and retrieved at high purity,” the company explained.
The back-contact technology was chosen for the module, the scientists explained, as it embeds the cell interconnection, as well as most of the bussing and wiring, in a single layer on the panel back side between the encapsulant and the backsheet. In conventional PERC monocrystalline panels, by contrast, cell interconnections are intertwined when connecting front to back side.
The first prototypes will be analyzed in a testing field in Amsterdam. “Ultimately, the new encapsulation must be demonstrated to work seamlessly with the standard lamination process used for all solar modules,” said Endurans, in its own statement. “Once this is achieved, the Parsec-developed recycling technology is well placed to become the industry standard, not only in back-contact technology but for all PV modules.”
*The article was amended on December 10 to reflect that the backsheet provider is Endurans Solar and not DSM, as we previously reported.

Catherine Pommier, the innovation director of Ad’Occ, the regional economic development agency in Occitanie, southern France, has revealed, at the EnerGaïa Forum, that the agency is planning to attract investors for the construction of a solar module factory.
The agency is targeting to start with an initial capacity of 2 GW and has already identified an area at the industrial area of Pyrénia, close to the Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyrénées airport in Tarbes, in the Hautes-Pyrénées département, as a location for the facility.
“We expect the factory will occupy an area of 60 hectares and will need a supply of 100,000m3 of water and 23 MWh of electricity,” Pommier specified. “We have also identified the presence of two solar glass suppliers in Spain, and six extruded aluminum manufacturers in Occitanie.  The agency believes it may find investors within two years.”
Occitanie is one of France's regions with the highest levels of installed PV capacity. It currently has 2.5 GW and is projected to reach 7 GW by 2030, and 15 GW by 2050. “These targets will require the setting up of an entire production ecosystem across the entire value chain,” Pommier concluded, without revealing further details.
Currently, there is another solar module gigafactory under development in France, that of Norwegian solar module manufacturer REC, which is planning to build its heterojunction PV module factory on the eastern part of the industrial area ZACEuropole II, in Hambach, near Sarreguemines, in the northwestern France region of Moselle.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/09/uganda-turns-to-solar-mini-grids-to-level-up-its-northern-region/,"COMMUNITY,FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,MINIGRID,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UGANDA",COSMAS MWIRIGI,"DECEMBER 9, 2021",Uganda turns to solar mini-grids to level-up its northern region,"The role solar can play in helping to achieve food security has been highlighted by the commissioning of 25 mini-grids in Northern Uganda, with backing from Germany's state development agency and the EU.
The two donors, and the Ugandan government, have commissioned London-based off-grid developer Winch Energy to install the mini-grids as part of the European Union and UN-backed Development Initiative for Northern Uganda (DINU), which aims to bridge the development gap between the north and the rest of the African nation.
Development agency the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, and the EU, will fund the mini-grid program with non-repayable grants to the extent of UGX18 billion (€4.44 million) with the local networks to be established in 25 villages in the Lamwo district of Uganda.
Solar could disrupt the fossil fuel industry and help with two of the biggest sustainability challenges of our times: biodiversity loss and food production. pv magazine’s UP initiative this year shone a spotlight on agrivoltaics. Read our coverage here.
Winch, which is owned by French renewables business Total Eren; Japanese conglomerate Itochu Corp; Saudi electrical manufacturer Al Gihaz Holding; and U.K. financial services firm Winch Partners Ltd, said funding for the solar networks included a significant sum which would enable it to reduce the price paid by electricity users for their energy.
The company's country director for Uganda, Alex Wanume, said the total project cost is $4 million and 60% of the sum will be used to subsidize the cost of the electricity generated so the 15,000 people and 100 businesses which will benefit will pay only $0.29/kWh. “This is the lowest tariff for mini-grids in Africa or anywhere else in the world,” he said. “People can now get affordable power for business and even for home use. A lower tariff is what we are looking at, at the end of the day; lower tariffs and good quality services.”
The total generation capacity to be installed by Winch will be around 1 MW, said Wanume.
In addition to benefiting individual homes and businesses, the mini-grids will also supply solar-powered street lighting and improved water services through pumping and purification.
The €25.9 million DINU program, set up in December 2017 with €25.5 million from the EU and the balance from the UN's Capital Development Fund, is set to run until June and aims to bridge the gap between the region and the rest of Uganda by addressing nutrition and food security, roads, and good governance.
The solar mini-grids are set to boost agricultural productivity, according to Lamwo-district local authority representative Dennis Onyong. He said: “Agriculture is a major source of livelihood. Despite farmers producing a lot, at the moment, they are earning little because the value is not added to the products going to the market. This should now change with access to electricity.”
Fellow local official Bernard Charles Eliyanno said: “The power from the mini-grids is a positive move to help our farmers take it to another level of value addition. I believe that we will be food secure, have an increase in the volume of incomes, and shall be able to create more employment opportunities.”
Matthias Schauer, the German ambassador to Uganda, said energy emissions are expected to be the principal source of future greenhouse gas emission growth in Uganda and mini-grids will play an important role in mitigating that rise, as well diversifying the nation's renewable energy portfolio away from a dependence of hydropower, which can be affected by climate change; and offering better energy efficiency than traditional agricultural use of biomass.
Uganda's energy minister, Okaasai Sidronius Opolot, said the government is aiming for universal access to electricity by 2040.
“We are, therefore, not setting up mini-grids only in Lamwo,” he said. “We have tendered out 40 mini-grids to be developed and operated by the private sector and [it is] estimated [they will] provide 4,000 connections. Of the 40 mini-grids, 25 have been set up in Lamwo, and 15 will be set up in Isingiro and Rakai districts.
“The National Development Plan III aims to have 1,500 mini-grids installed in the next five years, and the current National Electrification Strategy plans about 2,700 mini-grids to be installed by 2030. The implementation of these mini-grids will follow a private-sector approach with the participation of the government.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/09/sodium-battery-research-tackles-formation-of-dendrites/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"DECEMBER 9, 2021",Sodium battery research tackles formation of dendrites,"As the race for viable alternatives to lithium-ion technology accelerates, sodium batteries are emerging as one of the front-runners. Earlier this year, battery manufacturing heavyweight CATL unveiled plans to commercialize its first-generation sodium-ion batteries by 2023, bringing the technology out of the lab and into the real world of manufacturing.
Meanwhile, back in the labs, researchers are putting their heads together to solve some of the key hurdles that have held back sodium batteries from going mainstream. In a pair of new papers, two research groups at The University of Texas at Austin have detailed different pathways they took to addressing the same problem.
One of the groups has created a new electrolyte that eliminates some of the common issues of sodium-sulfur batteries by preventing the sulfur from dissolving away. They have demonstrated that by tweaking the solvation structure of the electrolyte, a solid-electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic components can be realized at both the sulfur cathode and the Na anode. 
This means that the intermediate compounds formed from sulfur remain in a “half-dissolved” state instead of dissolving in the liquid electrolyte and migrating between the two electrodes within the battery. This process, known as shuttling, can lead to material loss, degradation of components, and the growth of dendrites on the anode. Needle-like filaments called dendrites can in turn cause the battery to rapidly degrade, short circuit, and even catch fire or explode.
By stopping the dissolution of sulfur, the new electrolyte eliminates Na polysulfide (NaPS) shuttling and facilitates dendrite-free Na-metal plating and stripping. This enables a longer life cycle for the battery, showing a stable performance over 300 charge-discharge cycles with a capacity fade of as low as 0.10% per cycle.
The researchers say that scalability of this approach to pouch cells demonstrates its potential for practical viability. Their findings were published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.
Faster charging
The other group or researchers has developed a new sodium metal anode for rechargeable batteries that resists the formation of dendrites. The new material, called sodium antimony telluride intermetallic – Na metal composite (NST-Na) – allows cycling at 100% depth of discharge and as an anode-free metal battery. Theoretically, it has the highest energy density of any sodium anode.
NST-Na is made by repeated cold rolling and folding, which involves rolling a thin sheet of sodium metal onto an antimony telluride powder, folding it over on itself, and repeating many times. The researchers found that this process leads to a uniform distribution of sodium atoms, which makes it less likely to form dendrites or surface corrosion.
Typically, the sodium atoms that carry a charge in a battery bind more strongly to each other than they do to the anode, and in so doing they tend to form instabilities, or clumps of sodium that attract more sodium atoms and eventually lead to dendrites.
Referring to their density functional theory calculations, the researchers say that the uniqueness of NST lies in the thermodynamic stability of the Na atoms (rather than clusters) on its surface that leads to planar wetting, and in its own stability that prevents decomposition during cycling. As a result, this makes the battery more stable and allows faster charging, comparable to a lithium-ion battery’s charge rate. 
“We’re essentially solving two problems at once,” said David Mitlin, a professor in the Cockrell School of Engineering’s Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Research Laboratory who designed the new material. “Typically, the faster you charge, the more of these dendrites you grow. So if you suppress dendrite growth, you can charge and discharge faster, because all of a sudden it’s safe.”
The scientists published their results in the journal Advanced Materials.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/09/flexible-metal-dichalcogenide-solar-cell-with-5-1-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 9, 2021",Flexible metal dichalcogenide solar cell with 5.1% efficiency,"Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are two-dimensional materials with remarkable semiconducting properties and high optical absorption coefficients, which makes them suitable for the manufacture of semi-transparent and flexible solar cells with potential applications in aerospace, architecture, electric vehicles, and wearable electronics, where light weight, a high power-per-weight ratio, and flexibility are very desirable.
With this in mind, a group of scientists from Stanford University has built a TMD solar cell that is claimed to achieve a power per weight ratio on a par with well-established thin-film technologies such as cadmium telluride (CdTe); copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS); amorphous silicon (a-Si); and III-V solar cells.
“By adopting novel device architecture and integration methods we achieved over 10 times higher power conversion efficiency and over 100 times higher power per weight, compared to previous demonstrations,” the research corresponding author, Koosha Nassiri Nazif, told pv magazine.
The cell was built with an ultrathin, lightweight and flexible polyimide (PI) substrate with a thickness of 5μm, transparent hole-collecting graphene contacts doped with molybdenum oxide (MoOx), and multi-layer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) absorbers measuring around 200nm. Furthermore, the U.S. group used passivation and anti-reflection coatings, and optically-reflective electron-collecting gold (Au) bottom contacts.
The use of graphene contacts is an important aspect of the cell technology as it mitigates Fermi-level pinning, which is a phenomenon that occurs in solar cells, and especially in TMD devices, when an energy barrier is created for electrons and holes by bending the bands at the semiconductor interface. The Fermi levels define the efficient conversion of the energy of radiation into electrochemical energy and Fermi-level pinning has been responsible for limiting the power conversion efficiency of the best TMD solar cells to around 2%.
Tested under standard solar radiation conditions, the device showed an efficiency of 5.1% and a power per weight return of 4.4 W/g, which the scientist said compares to a 0.7% efficiency and a power per weight of 0.04 W/g for the best device with a flexible structure built in previous research. Reducing the PI substrate thickness to 1 μm is projected to increase cell power per weight to 8.6 W/g. “According to realistic, detailed balance models developed for TMD photovoltaic cells, single-junction multi-layer TMDs can in principle achieve a power conversion efficiency of around 27%, with an optimized optical and electronic design,” they further explained.
According to the researchers, these cells have the potential to outperform organic and perovskite solar cells without the stability challenges that these two cell technologies present.
“Research efforts to scale up TMD growth to large areas would soon enable scalable and low-cost production of TMD photovoltaic cells, similar to other chalcogenide solar cells, such as CdTe and CIGS,” Nassiri Nazif told pv magazine. “The methods for scalable and large-area fabrication of TMDs already exist. However, there has not yet been any demonstration of large-area (>1cm2) TMD solar cells reported in the literature.”
Looking forward, the Stanford group said it wants to demonstrate large-area TMD solar cells made in a scalable fashion. Its findings can be found in the paper High-specific-power flexible transition metal dichalcogenide solar cells, which was recently published in nature communications.

The state-run Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) has signed 20-year power purchase agreements as offtaker for the power to be generated by facilities ranging in scale from 3-68 MW.
Two of the projects will receive $0.102/kWh from the power company, a third will receive $0.106, and the smallest facility, which will include battery storage and diesel to supply an island community, has secured the highest price offered for ‘clean energy' in Bangladesh to date: $0.25/kWh.
Get your copy of the December issue of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 has been another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for 2022 look even more promising.
The largest solar farm to secure the government's signature yesterday is one of two projects being planned by the Bangladesh-China Renewable Energy Company Pvt Ltd, a joint venture between state-owned entities in the two nations. The JV was set up in September last year to establish 500 MW of solar capacity in Bangladesh, with China supplying the funds and Bangladesh the land.
The BPDB has agreed to pay $0.102/kWh for a 68 MW solar site planned by the JV in Sirajganj district, in the north-west of the country, and will pay $0.106 for a 60 MW project being developed in Pabna district.
Bangladesh-China Renewable has already invited bids for the engineering, procurement and construction services contracts for both projects.
Singaporean developer Cyclect Energy was the only bidder for a 50 MW solar project planned in Chuadanga district by the power development board. After lodging a bid to accept $0.12/kWh for the electricity generated at the site, the developer eventually accepted a rate of $0.102 offered by the authority.
The BPDB had tendered for four solar plants in 2018, with the winning bidders to build, own and operate the sites, the other three of which are earmarked for Chittagong, Netrokona, and Mymensingh.
The record tariff of $0.25/kWh was awarded to a 3 MW solar-battery-diesel project which will serve 18,000 residents on the island of Monpura, in the Bhola district of southern-central Bangladesh. Local newspaper The Business Standard reported that project is being developed by Western Renewable Energy Pvt Ltd, part of Dhaka-based Western Engineering.
The government yesterday also confirmed Chinese developer Canves Environmental Investment Company Ltd will receive $0.215/kWh over 25 years for the electricity to be generated by a 42.5 MW energy-from-waste incinerator planned in Gaziur district, on the outskirts of Dhaka.
Bangladesh reportedly has 777.2 MW of renewable energy generation capacity, with solar making up 543.21 MW of that figure.

The U.S. International Development Finance Corp. (DFC) has approved up to $500 million of debt financing for thin-film module manufacturer First Solar. The DFC financing will support a 3.3 GW, vertically integrated solar module manufacturing facility that First Solar plans to build in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
The foundation stone for the First Solar fab was recently laid out at Pillaipakkam, Tamil Nadu. First Solar is the only U.S. company among the world’s 10 largest solar manufacturers. It announced plans to build the India facility in July, shortly after it unveiled plans for a new $680 million factory in Ohio that will add 3.3 GW of new domestic manufacturing capacity in the United States by 2023. The company expects to reach 16 GW of global manufacturing capacity in 2024.
“This transaction represents another milestone in the United States effort to drive alternative supply chains – and to articulate a vision for climate finance that drives our development mission,” said Dev Jagadesan, DFC’s acting CEO.
Mark Widmar, CEO of First Solar, said that India aims to “supercharge” the development of a domestic PV manufacturing industry. “DFC’s intent to support this facility has the potential to create a high-visibility, repeatable blueprint for enabling the clean energy ambitions of likeminded nations through American innovation, ingenuity, and competitiveness,” said Widmar.
This investment will promote DFC’s commitment to diversifying supply chains. First Solar produces thin-film solar panel modules, which do not use polysilicon. The company, which was the first of the world’s 10 largest solar manufacturers to join the Responsible Business Alliance, will replicate its transparency and traceability protocols in India, amplifying efforts to improve supply chain transparency throughout the renewable energy sector, said the DFC.

The new product, called Panel Energy, will combine Midsummer's copper indium gallium di-selenide (CIGS) solar panels with Medacciai's curved metal roof technology and will consist of a curved metal panel made with a thickness of 0.4 to 0.8mm that can be used, according to the manufacturer, on roofs where the slope or other technical-climatic conditions do not allow the use of a traditional panel.
The curved panel is made with a galvanized, flat external sheet, pre-coupled with a synthetic membrane in thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) or PVC, from a corrugated, galvanized steel, pre-painted sheet.
Under the terms of the deal, Medacciai has agreed to purchase 3.5 MW of panels, for €6.3 million per year, from Midsummer, and the Swedish manufacturer has agreed to buy up to 50,000 square meters of metal roofs from the Italian company, for €3 million per year. “The roofs will be sold together with Midsummer’s solar panels to the Italian market,” the two companies said in a joint statement. “The quantities are not binding for any party and the prices can also change, under certain conditions.”
“The Italian real-estate-restructuring sector is currently booming, mostly due to the 110% tax rebate for solar panels that has been extended 'till the end of 2023,” Midsummer Italia CEO Jarno Montella said. “Medacciai is riding this restructuring growth wave with its products and is also considering expanding its production.”
Midsummer began construction on a 50 MW BIPV module factory in Italy in early November. The facility, located in the southern region of Apulia, is being built with the support of the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (MISE) and the Italian investment institution Invitalia, which is part of the Italian Ministry of Finance, which provided a €38 million low-interest loan for the project. Production is expected to start next summer.

Renewable energy company RTE Energy has revealed plans to construct an 860 MW heterojunction solar PV panel factory near Townsville, in the Australian state of Queensland.
While details about the project remain scant, RTE Energy has revealed that the manufacturing facility will produce heterojunction solar cells, using technology provided by Switzerland-based manufacturer EcoSolifer.
Heterojunction solar cells, a technology that is already in large-scale production, are expected to significantly grow in terms of market share over the next decade. They rely on a layer of amorphous silicon to provide passivation and improve cell performance.
EcoSolifer commenced commercial production of its bifacial heterojunction solar cells in 2020 with a manufacturing line provided by heterojunction specialist Meyer Burger, at a 100 MW factory in Hungary. The company said the cells produced at the facility have now reached a conversion efficiency of 24.1%, but it noted that the results were still being confirmed by a third party.
RTE Energy said its heterojunction cells will be manufactured at its Townsville facility, with modules to be assembled on site. Construction of the factory, which will be partly powered by solar energy, is set to commence in 2022. Construction of an adjacent solar farm to power the factory will begin in 2023. Manufacturing is expected to start in 2023, with full production by March 2024.
The project will put RTE Energy into competition with Australia-based PV module manufacturer Tindo Solar. At present, Tindo Solar – which has been manufacturing solar PV modules in Adelaide for more than a decade – is in the process of commissioning a new factory in the city. The new facility will boost the company’s production capacity to 150 MW per annum and see Tindo Solar transition to the latest M10 cell technology.

On Dec. 1, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said that the United States could install 178 GW of renewables capacity from 2022 to the end of 2026. Just a few weeks earlier, S&P Global Market Intelligence published a report projecting that the United States could install 71 GW of wind and solar power in 2022 alone. Rystad Energy, meanwhile, has said that it expects 50% of global utility-scale solar projects to be potentially cancelled or postponed.
According to the IEA’s Renewables 2021 report, 2021 will be a record peak deployment year for the US market, with more than 39 GW of new wind and solar capacity additions. But beyond this record year, the IEA expects a downward trajectory for deployment.
In every year from 2022 to 2026, the IEA sees 26.6 GW, 28 GW, 29 GW, 25.6 GW, and 26.9 GW of solar power being deployed, respectively. In total, it estimates that 270 GW of solar capacity could be installed by the end of 2026 – nearly three times the 100 GW currently deployed by January of this year.
The IEA also included an “accelerated” deployment projection for the next five years, which would add 53.7 GW of capacity to its estimate. This addition would raise deployment projections from 178 GW to 231 GW of utility and distributed solar, plus onshore and offshore wind. These numbers may appear optimistic, but the group has long been known to publish laughably underestimated solar capacity growth estimates.
On an upward path, S&P sees potential for 44 GW of solar and 27 GW of new wind in 2022. The first year of its projected capacity increase is equivalent to nearly 40% of the five-year IEA growth estimates. In 2023, the S&P anticipates that solar will increase by nearly 33%, while wind capacity deployments will remain flat or slightly decline. Combined, S&P believes that we will see 156 GW of combined wind and solar additions in 2022 and 2023 – that’s 87% of the IEA’s five-year projection, in just two years.
Since the release of S&P’s report, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Build Back Better/Reconciliation package. S&P has said that if the package gets through the Senate with the main solar incentives in place, some of its 2022 solar volume projections could be delayed to 2023 or 2024.
Sitting amongst all of these cheery projections is one research firm that suggests that supply challenges could have a massive, negative impact on 2022. Rystad Energy has said that it believes that increases to supply chain prices, along with shipping costs, could lead to the postponement or cancellation of up to 50% of the world’s projected 90 GW of utility-scale solar projects.
The company notes that polysilicon prices have increased by more than 300%, and shipping costs for containers have grown by more than 500%. These increases have added $0.06-$0.08/kWh to the cost of solar panels. Roughly 75% of the United State’s 2022 capacity projections are expected to come from utility-scale projects.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst Jenny Chase, meanwhile, is pushing her own team to increase their solar power projections. “There is always at least a bit more solar than you think there is,” she said, while concurrently calling out the IEA for its small numbers.
