The system can absorb heat from the PV panels and transmit it to the nanofluid, where it can be transformed into thermal energy and used for different applications. The Malaysian group said their work uses micro-fins copper tubes for the first time, in order to enhance the thermal conductivity of the PCM.
PCM can absorb, store and release large amounts of latent heat over defined temperature ranges. They have often been used at the research level for PV module cooling and the storage of heat.
The scientists built the system with a 30 W solar module measuring 640 mm x 360 mm x 25 mm. They used a 9.52 mm pipe, which they soldered to the panel with copper tape and pure copper. They also used a PCM container filled with 2.75 kg of nano PCM, a heat exchanger, and a PCM expansion tank.
“The operational fluid from the reservoir is pushed through the PVT by a pump,” they explained. “In order to keep the entryway’s temperature stable, the working fluid loses heat from the PVT by passing through a heat exchanger connected with the cooling unit.”
The scientists tested the systems under different illumination conditions and a room temperature of 27 C, with the working fluid temperature set at 20 C, controlled by a water-cooling chiller. The temperature of the cooled PV panel fell from 86.2 C to 42.1 C, which pushed its overall efficiency to 89%.
“The thermal and electrical energy of a PVT system utilizing Nano PCM and Nanofluids in a Micro fins tube is more than that of any other system studied,” the researchers said, without providing data on system costs.
The researchers presented the system in “Experimental analysis for the photovoltaic thermal collector (PVT) with nano PCM and micro-fins tube nanofluid,” which was recently published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering. In recent years, the group has also developed multi-level fin heat sinks for solar module cooling, as well as lapping and longitudinal fins.

Scientists from State University of Ponta Grossa in Brazil and the University of Louisiana in the United States have jointly investigated the impact of floating solar on the water evaporation rate in reservoirs.
They used a 130 kW solar system on the Passaúna reservoir in the Brazilian state of Paraná as a case study. The reservoir spans 8.5 square kilometers and has an average depth of 6.5 meters. Its total volume is 69.3 cubic hectometers (hm3).
The system occupies 1,265.14 square meters of area and has 395 PV modules. The polycrystalline modules have a maximum power rating of 330 W and measure 1,960 mm x 991 mm x 40 mm.
The reservoir borders the cities of Curitiba, Araucária, and Campo Largo, and supplies 20% of the water consumed by the population of the metropolitan region of Curitiba, Paraná. The researchers used the Penmam-Monteith method recommended by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization to measure the rate of water evaporation.
They found that 4.47 million cubic meters (m3) of water evaporated from the reservoir in the space of a year, equivalent to 10.4% of the water volume consumed annually by the local population. The team calculated that the floating solar system reduced water evaporation with an efficiency of 60.20%.
They also studied the impact of different PV system sizes on the water evaporation rate.
“The larger the area of the floating solar system on the water surface, the greater the reduction in water evaporation and, consequently, the greater the volume of water saved,” the researchers said.
The results indicate that a 5 MW system could save about 16,000 m3 of water per year, which is equivalent to the water consumed by 196 people in the region per year. The electricity produced by the system could also cover the consumption of 2,563 inhabitants in the state of Paraná, assuming a per capita consumption of 1.95 kWh.
The researchers shared their results in “Effects of a Floating Photovoltaic System on the Water Evaporation Rate in the Passaúna Reservoir, Brazil,” which was recently published in Energies.

The secondary regulations are the first such technical rules in Romania. They will support primary legislation dating back to the 2012-13 period, which already has some provisions for storage deployment.
“So far, there were no technical parameters for what storage installations should observe,” Daniel Vlasceanu, partner at Romanian law firm Vlăsceanu & Partners, told pv magazine. “The legal framework regulating technical aspects simply did not exist. As such, there are no storage systems implemented for large wind or PV projects to date – neither next to an existing power plant, nor on a standalone basis.”
He said the new regulations should help investors, as they will now know what equipment to buy and install. “Of course, a lot more is needed in order to prepare a complete business case,” he added.
The new rules establish four project categories with capacities between 800 kW and 1 MW, between 1 MW and 5 MW, between 5 MW and 20 MW, and above 20 MW.
“A few years ago, when the second wave of renewables was only emerging, there were interpretations that any added storage capacity would have to be counted against the capacity permitted under the technical connection permit (ATR),” Vlasceanu explained. “It is now clear (from several provisions spread under the new legislation that storage installations can be added to a project having obtained already an ATR, or even a connection certificate, without amendment to the permitted capacity.”
For installations smaller than 800 kW, storage system owners will reportedly be granted unspecified exemptions. The new rules for storage follow a series of legislative changes aimed at expanding the share of renewables in the country's electricity mix. They include a reduction of value-added tax (VAT) on residential solar, faster permitting processes for PV plants on agricultural land, and new provisions to simplify the grid-connection process for renewable projects below 10.8 kW in size.

Faced with the age-old quandary of how to cool residential buildings during the summer without central air HVAC systems, compressors that drain the grid and cause system outages, or toxic refrigerants harmful to the environment, a San Francisco startup has devised a window-mounted, mini-split air conditioner.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the number of AC units in buildings across the world is projected to hit 5.6 billion by 2050. Current HVAC systems – built by industry incumbents whose product design hasn’t changed in decades —are damaging the environment.
Gradient, a technology company that has designed the first consumer HVAC device using a heat pump technology, has closed a Series A funding round of $18 million from Sustainable Future Ventures and Ajax Strategies.
“We are reimagining the HVAC industry by building products that keep homes comfortable and healthy for the people who inhabit them, without compromising the environment,” said Vince Romanin, co-founder and chief executive officer of Gradient. “Support from Sustainable Future Ventures will enable us to expand our operations, build new products, and achieve a 95% carbon reduction when our products are used to both heat and cool.”
“The global market for HVAC is $100 billion per year and growing rapidly,” said Matt Chagan, partner at Sustainable Future Ventures. “We are thrilled to support Gradient’s mission and be part of their mission-driven journey.”
Gradient’s first product, the Gradient, is a replacement for the traditional window AC, designed to give consumers the aesthetic of not blocking the window like traditional ACs do. Gradient uses heat pump technology and a climate-friendly refrigerant to create a product that the company says is quiet, effective, and energy efficient.
Gradient’s window unit requires an opening of at least 15 inches height, a window width of no less than 24 inches, and clearance of at least 24 inches below the window sill. An additional 6 to 16 inches of depth clearance into the single or double-hung window opening is also required.  The unit weighs 50 pounds and produces 48 to 58 decibels of noise between low and high setting. On cooling setting, the unit produces 8,600 BTU per hour, while the heating function produces 8,000 BTU per hour and operated at a standard 120 V power setting.
The first Gradient units will be shipped over the Summer of 2023 and are available for preorder on the company’s website for $1,999 MSRP, including a $99 deposit. The consumer heat pump unit includes a one-year parts and labor warranty, and can be controlled via smartphone app, which provides daily heating and cooling scheduling functionality.
The company’s Series A funding is devoted to design and development of its second product, a window heat pump unit that decarbonizes heating in cold climate environments.
Meanwhile the company is planning a marketing strategy that will focus on multi-family homes, while it adds services like hardware monitoring, maintenance, leasing, and demand response services including integration with virtual power plants. Additional funds from the round will be devoted for hiring new personnel.
Other investors in the company’s Series A round include Safar Partners, Climate Tech Circle, Shared Future Fund, At One and Impact Science. Matt Chagan, a partner at Sustainable Future Ventures, has joined the company’s board.
In August 2022, Gradient was awarded a seven-year contract by the New York City Housing Authority, New York Power Authority and New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to deliver thousands of cold climate packaged window heat pump units in the New York area.

The large-scale system features 800 high-energy density lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries and occupies 2 hectares of land. It is the largest energy storage system in Southeast Asia, according to Sembcorp.
“Its rapid response time to store and supply power in milliseconds is essential in mitigating solar intermittency caused by changing weather conditions in Singapore’s tropical climate,” the company said in a statement. “It can also provide reserves to the power grid, which frees up power generation plants to generate more electricity to meet demand, when needed.”
A central control system regulates the batteries' charge and discharge cycles according to grid needs. The integrated system also includes liquid cooling systems or built-in air conditioning systems to maintain optimal operating temperatures.
It uses Envision’s Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) platform for monitoring and control services. It also features Huawei’s Smart String ESS solution for temperature control.
The February edition of pv magazine, due out on Wednesday, is devoted entirely to energy storage, with topics ranging from how battery suppliers can avoid supply-chain related policy risks, to the plans Russia hatched to be a hydrogen superpower – before it invaded Ukraine.
In addition, Sembcorp operates a 360 MW battery in the United Kingdom.

Array Technologies says it will establish a manufacturing facility in Australia, after being tapped to supply locally manufactured trackers to the 102 MW Glenrowan solar farm.
The massive PV project is being developed by Pacific Partnerships, a subsidiary of Sydney-based construction firm Cimic Group. The company said its Australian factory will initially supply ground-mounted tracker systems for the Glenrowan array, but will eventually provide trackers for other new solar installations in Australia.
Array Technologies Chief Executive Officer Kevin Hostetler said the factory will bolster the company’s presence in the Australian marketplace and help spur economic growth in the region.
“This decision will help us meet the growing demand for renewable energy utilities, expedite project schedules, and have long-lasting economic benefits for Australia,” he said.
The Glenrowan solar farm, which is being developed on a 245-hectare site, is one of six large-scale energy generation and storage projects to have won supply contracts under the state’s second renewable energy target auction (VRET2). Together, the projects will deliver 623 MW of new generation and up to 365 MW/600 MWh of new energy storage.
Array Technologies said it is the first tracker supplier to win a contract under the VRET scheme, which is designed to grow renewable energy manufacturing capacity in the state and help the Victorian government meet its commitment to power all of its operations with renewable energy by 2025.
The VRET2 scheme is part of the state government’s plan to drive significant investment in all six renewable energy zones located across Victoria. The Victorian government has estimated the scheme will support the creation of 920 direct jobs and attract AUD 1.48 billion ($1.02 billion) in new renewable energy projects in the state.
“Generating new investment in renewable energy will have lasting benefits for Victoria’s economy, making energy delivery across the state more reliable and affordable,” said Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio.
The construction of the Glenrowan solar farm has already started, with the project expected to commence operations by the end of 2023. It will connect to the existing nearby Glenrowan Terminal Substation. It is expected to generate electricity equivalent for approximately 45,000 Australian homes.

The Japanese electronics manufacturer said it will transfer all after-sale services to its XSOL unit in March.
“We will continue to provide after-sales service for our products and for residential solar power generation systems for more than 20 years,” said Toshiba.
The company said it will focus its solar business on the development and construction of commercial and industrial PV projects, as well as the production of polymer film-based perovskite solar modules.
The company started operating as a residential PV system supplier in Japan in 2010. In September 2021, it claimed to have achieved the highest efficiency ever reached for a large-area, polymer film-based perovskite PV module. Looking forward, the company says it wants to enlarge the module area and achieve efficiencies close to 20%.
In September 2022, it claimed a 9.5% efficiency rating for a transparent cuprous oxide (Cu2O) thin-film solar cell. It said that by placing the Cu2Ocell over a silicon (Si) cell with 25% efficiency, it could achieve a Cu2O-Si tandem cell with 28.5% efficiency.
