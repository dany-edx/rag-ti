Over 100 countries have pledged to be carbon neutral by 2050, according to the United Nations. A recent study conducted by researchers at the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that to totally decarbonize global electrical systems using solar in the 2050 to 2060 decade, the world would need to install 63.4 TW of PV. The findings of the study are published in “Photovoltaic Deployment Scenarios Toward Global Decarbonization: Role of Disruptive Technologies,” which appears in the journal Solar RRL.
The researchers modeled viable trajectories to supply > 60 TW of installed solar capacity to meet the goal of global decarbonization and studied the effect of a disruptive technology on deployment cost and market opportunity. They concluded that it is possible for production to scale up to the 2.9 TW to 3.7 TW needed per year within 10 to 15 years, a goal that will cost from $600 billion to $660 billion. The model includes using existing technology as well as mature technologies using silicon and CdTe. The study estimates that disruptive technologies offer a $1 to $2 trillion market opportunity and that the potential for cost savings could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars.
The disruptive technologies include cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based PV, perovskites and tandem technologies. CdTe, which is the technology used by solar manufacturers First Solar and Toledo Solar, among others, currently represents about 16% of the U.S. solar market, NREL reports. Perovskites have challenges with long-term durability, but they offer advantages in manufacturing because they can be printed quickly and relatively inexpensively in a roll-to-roll method. Tandems pair technologies, such as perovskite on silicon, and several companies are beginning to manufacture tandems including TandemPV, CubicPV and OxfordPV.
According to NREL, tandem devices and minimodules are seeing efficiencies of as much as 31.25%. And while the efficiencies are promising, and other tandems continue to be developed, R&D is still needed in order for these devices to be manufactured at the scale needed to achieve terawatt capacities.
“There are economically viable trajectories that get to the needed manufacturing capacity to produce the amount of PV needed to completely decarbonize the world’s energy economy,” said Jao van de Lagemaat, director of the Chemistry and Nanoscience Center at the U.S. Department of Energy’s NREL. “Emerging technologies could potentially lower the cost of this deployment significantly if they get commercialized in time.”
To provide enough solar over the next two decades to decarbonize the global electrical system will require an “unprecedented ramp-up of production capacity”, but it is achievable, according to the NREL analysis.
The estimated target of 63.4 TW needed between 2050 and 2060 is a 60-fold increase in the amount of installed PV worldwide today. When the researchers say this is possible, it is under the assumption that investors protect their investments by avoiding stranded production assets. The model demonstrates that a sustainable ramp-up of manufacturing is possible, and that disruptive technologies will play a role in lowering capital costs.
Another assumption is that the lifespan of a PV module will increase considerably, possibly from an average of 30 years in 2020 to 50 years by 2040.
Looking beyond the 2050 to 2060 decade, van de Lagemaat, noted that module retirement and population growth will be the drivers of a “relatively modest demand” after global decarbonization is reached.
In addition to van de Lagemaat, the other authors are Michael Woodhouse from NREL and Billy Stanbery from Colorado School of Mines. NREL’s internal Laboratory Directed Research and Development program funded the research.

Italy's Council of Ministers has authorized the construction of 13 agrivoltaic projects with a combined capacity of 593.6 MW in a bid to further streamline the development of large-scale installations across the country.
Twelve of the projects are located in the southern region of Apulia and the remaining one is planned to be deployed in the neighboring region of Basilicata. The approved projects will not need to go through additional environmental impact assessments.
Among the approved projects is an agrivoltaic plant in the municipality of Stornara, in the province of Foggia, and an agrivoltaic facility of 43 MW, to be built across three different municipalities in the province of Brindisi.
Another project is planned for the municipality of Manfredonia, near Foggia, and a plant of about 53 MW is to be built in the municipality of Cerignola, in the same province.
The greenlight also arrived for what the government called an “agri-naturalistic-voltaic plant” in the municipality of Cerignola and another 48 MW plant in Stornara.
The agrivoltaic plant in Basilicate will be located in the municipality of Tolve, in the province of Potenza.
The Italian government began bypassing regional authorities to authorize some renewable energy projects in March 2022 in response to a policy change for renewable energy permits. Since then, the Italian solar and renewable energy market has shown clear signs of recovery. A few months later, in October, the government authorized the construction of eight renewable energy projects with a combined capacity of 314 MW.

On May 4, the photovoltaic systems in Germany fed more than 40 GW of power into the grid for the first time.
“New record,” tweeted Bruno Burger, head of Energy Charts at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE. The mark was surpassed at around 1 pm with around 40.014 GW, his analysis shows.

It wasn't just May 4 that was a good day for solar power generation. While large parts of the country still long for warm temperatures and a permanent spring, bright sunshine and rather cool temperatures are perfect for the generation of photovoltaic systems.
According to the information from Energy Charts, a total of almost 1,744.5 GWh of solar power was produced for public net power generation and fed into the grid in the first week of May. This is a share of 23.6%, which puts photovoltaics ahead of lignite with a share of 19.9% and onshore wind power with 19.1%. Overall, in the first days of May, renewables accounted for 66.8% of net public electricity generation.
The high feed-in from photovoltaics and wind power helped lower the retail electricity price. On Sunday afternoon, the price of electricity on the spot market even fell into slightly negative territory. There was a price peak in intraday trading on May 3 at 8 pm, with €163 euros per MWh. During the record PV feed-in the following day, the price dropped to €43 euros per MWh.

The system is designed to reach a heating capacity of 5.7 kW and an overall coefficient of performance (COP) of 1.40 at nominal conditions. It is made with an engine unit, a heat pump unit, and a gas resonator unit in a loop.
The engine consists of a heat-sink heat exchanger, a regenerator, a high-temperature heat exchanger, and a thermal buffer tube. The cooler unit is made with a heat-sink heat exchanger, a regenerator, a heat-source heat exchanger, and a thermal buffer tube.
The system is initially excited by the thermoacoustic oscillation and it uses the amplified acoustic power to drive the heat pump unit to pump heat from the heat source to the heat sink.
“The heat-source temperature varies between 260 K and 310 K, reflecting the variations in system performance over the seasons,” the scientists emphasized. “The heat-sink temperature varies between 298 K and 363 K, covering the range of applications from low-temperature underfloor space heating to the provision of domestic hot water.”
According to the research team, the heat pump is capable of offering stable COP values varying between 1.1 and 1.5 over most of the temperature range. “Especially in the typical domestic heating supply temperature range of 50-70 C, the proposed heat pump system can pump several kilowatts (1-11 kW) of heat from a heat source of 260 K to 310 K with remarkable efficiency,” it also noted.
The research team comprises academics from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany and the Tsinghua University and Southeast University, which are both located in China. Its findings were published in the paper “A heat-driven thermoacoustic heat pump with a single direct-coupling configuration capable of utilizing medium/low-grade heat for domestic applications,” published in Energy Proceedings.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/08/the-pv-industry-facing-its-ultimate-efficiency-fever/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",,"MAY 8, 2023",The PV scientific community’s rush to the latest efficiency record,"2022! What an amazing year! It was the year the PV industry reached one terawatt (TW) of global cumulative PV installations, and that the first tandem solar cell reached over 30% conversion efficiency combining silicon and perovskite materials.
Many called this 30% the psychological barrier of the technology: sort of an initiation for perovskite as an emerging technology.
Perovskite is a new material structure that quickly conquered the PV world – a world that is often very reluctant to be “impressed” by breakthrough innovations. However, perovskite solar cells, due to their processing simplicity and unique properties, have been massively studied in academic and commercial labs. Not just a few, but thousands of researchers worldwide started to improve knowledge and achieve new efficiency records with this new material. Only ten years since its introduction in PV, a lab record of 25% was achieved with a single material (single junction) device. Surpassing the efficiency limit of any single material device (name it: silicon, perovskite, CIGS, etc.) while maintaining the low-cost potential is the main gap that the PV community wants to fill. This is, so far, only possible if, instead of one single material, two materials are used for the conversion of light into electricity. Silicon and perovskite are the main candidates. Silicon is the current TW-scale material for the energy transition and perovskite because of its tunable material properties and its potential for low-cost. The combination offers the potential to reach over 30% efficiency in a low-cost, large-deployment scenario. With these two materials available, the community witnessed a rush to smash the 30% efficiency limit: “the 30% rush”!
In 2022, not once but multiple times, the 30% barrier was smashed by combining these materials. First, by Swiss researchers at CSEM/EPFL, then by TNO, TU-Eindhoven, imec and TU-Delft partners in Solliance, and finally by Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin, which demonstrated over 32% conversion efficiency with their tandem cell. Just last April the limit has been pushed forward to 33.2% by the researchers at KAUST.
 
The PV community was not new to passing 30% of course, look for example at III-V semiconductors, mainly developed for space applications, but it is the first time that this efficiency has been achieved with materials with low-cost potential like the combination of silicon with perovskite.
Previous PV rushes
Was this the first “rush” in the PV community? Absolutely not. Looking at the world champion efficiency chart by NREL, it is clear that there were also similar patterns around 20% and 25% efficiency milestones. How do you recognize these periods? Notice the increase in cell record efficiencies just before the milestone is reached.
In recent years, we are seeing the “ultimate” rush. This is the goal to reach the highest efficiency for a single material silicon solar cell, capped at the theoretical limit of about 29%. The aim here would be to obtain the ultimate and highest record. The latest efficiency record is held by Longi at 26.8% and many companies have intentions to beat this soon.
Life after the “rush”
Historically, after a major record is reached, there is a period where development seems to slow. After the 20% rush, there was a 10-year period where no new record was achieved. Similarly, there was a 20-year gap after the 25% threshold was achieved.
So, what happens in the PV community in between each major record? To understand it, one needs to look not only at the lab record efficiency chart, but at manufacturing and installation trends. Most of these records are achieved on small areas, in research settings. The next step involves scaling to large areas through innovations to simplify processing and manufacturability, and ultimately to bring it to mass production. This requires the efforts of academia, research institutes and companies. Just to offer an example, about 12-15 years ago, researchers were focusing on developing a new n-type silicon-based cell concept. Then, the rule of thumb was that a new cell architecture was not even considered until its efficiency was above 20% on a 6-inch wafer area (at that time, the lab record was at 25%). This rule was to demonstrate the importance of large-area rather than “just” lab efficiency. After a period of rush, research focuses on narrowing the gap between the lab record and mass-produced cell efficiencies.
If history repeats itself, starting already this year, major resources will be focused on the industrialization of perovskite/silicon tandem cells and modules. There are four major challenges to realizing commercial tandems. First, based on the record technology, the highest-performing material stack needs to be scaled up to industry-relevant sizes (over 100s cm2). Second, the reliability of such a large-area device must be proven in relevant outdoor conditions. Third, all potential technologies need a detailed techno-economic analysis of the cost/benefit and manufacturing feasibility and (hopefully) a full lifecycle analysis. This includes material availability and new tools for the deposition of perovskite and transport layers. Lastly, large-scale manufacturing – with high-throughput tools and abundant materials – of a reliable, cost-effective, fully integrated tandem cell and module needs to be demonstrated for the technology to be bankable. Only then would the 30% rush have completed the cycle.
Of course, for the scientific community, after a new major record there’s always another threshold. And for tandem devices, we are experiencing a much faster turnover of efficiency records typical of the early stage of development of a new technology holding an incredible potential. How long do you think it will take for the PV community to reach 35%?
Gianluca Coletti is Adjunct Professor at University of New South Wales Sydney and Program Manager Tandem Photovoltaic Technology and Applications at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), which is currently seeking to bring to the market a two-terminal (2T) perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell technology in the frame of a four-year research project called FIT4Market.

The two companies want to invest $35 million in the projects. For two of them, each with a capacity of 400 kW, they have already secured a power purchase agreement (PPA) from Travelodge, a hotel group in Gaborone, and Ramotswe, a plastic manufacturing company for water tanks. The plants are both scheduled to be completed by the end of August.
“Currently, we have 30 MW in the pipeline of 25 to 35 individual grid-tied solar projects of about 400 kW, some being bigger and others slightly smaller,” Kofi Owusu Bempah, CEO of Pash Global, told pv magazine. “The idea is to sell power to private off-takers. We like Botswana because renewable energy penetration is very low, enabling us to directly negotiate with private businesses to support their energy needs and reduce their cost of power.”
The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the projects will range between $0.08 and $0.10/kWh. The projects will be located in areas like Gaborone, Ramotswe, and Lobatse.
The names of the other off-takers will be disclosed once the PPAs are signed.
Pash Global is looking to collaborate with other partners in this project and venturing into other countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Mali, and South Africa.

This result reportedly beat the record achieved by Japanese chemical company Kaneka. Its 180 mm² crystalline silicon device, which featured heterojunction and back-contact technology, achieved 26.63% efficiency.
“We cannot disclose if the cell is n-type or p-type at this stage,” a Longi's spokesperson told pv magazine at the time. Now, however, an international research group led by Longi Central R&D Institute has decided to present the solar cell in the paper “Silicon heterojunction solar cells with up to 26.81% efficiency achieved by electrically optimized nanocrystalline-silicon hole contact layers,” published in nature energy.
The group built the M6-sized cell with a transparent conductive oxides (TCO) contact, a p-type amorphous silicon hydrogenated (p-nc-Si:H) layer, a nanocrystalline silicon layer, a p-a-Si:H layer, an n-type crystalline silicon absorber, an i-a-Si:H layer, passivating contacts (CSPCs) made of hydrogenated silicon monoxide (SiOx:H), silver (Ag) top electrodes, and an anti-reflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2).
The device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 26.81%, an open-circuit voltage of 751.4 mV, a short-circuit current of of 41.45 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 86.07%.
“The implementation of p-nc-Si:H together with matched TCO leads to a dramatic reduction in the contact resistivity at the rear side, resulting in an efficiency increase,” they further explained, noting that this cell configuration also increased the charge carrier transport and a low contact resistivity. “The cells endowed with these electrical improvements easily trigger band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) transport behavior and induce a sharp band bending, enhancing hole extraction efficiency.”
The researchers attributed the cell efficiency improvement to the implementation of p-nc-Si:H together with a modified TCO, which they said greatly reduces the cell contact resistivity. “The total series resistance of the solar cell is reduced from the original 0.37 to 0.2 Ω cm2, yielding a record fill factor for a single-junction silicon solar cell,” they stated.
The research team included scientists from the Delft University of Technology, which recently developed new passivating contacts (CSPCs) made of polysilicon and silicon monoxide (poly-SiOx) and the Sun Yat-sen University in China, which recently built a perovskite solar cell based on a nitrogen-doped titanium oxide (TiOxNy) electron transport layer that achieved a record fill factor.
In September, Longi said it had achieved an efficiency of 26.12% for a gallium-doped, p-type heterojunction (HJT) solar cell based on an M6 wafer. The company also achieved an efficiency of 25.47% for the same solar cell in March.
In addition, the Chinese manufacturer recorded an efficiency of 26.5% for an n-type HJT solar cell in June and a 25.19% rating for its p-type TOPCon solar cell in July 2021. In June 2021, it achieved a 25.21% efficiency rating for an n-type TOPCon PV cell.

They shared their findings in “Assessing the carbon footprint of photovoltaic modules through the EU Ecodesign Directive,” recently published in Solar Energy.
The method is divided into nine main steps. These include a life cycle assessment (LCA) hotspot analysis devoted to identifying the areas where environmental impacts are most significant. This application of the method for PV modules identifies carbon footprint as the most significant area, but water and resource use, among others, could be considered instead.
The following steps involve adapting Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCRs) for use in ecodesign requirements for PV modules. The new “harmonized calculation rules” are set to calculate the carbon impact of PV modules from production to market entry with a particular focus on manufacturing and shipment phases.
The method performs a sensitivity analysis of the PV modules’ silicon content, module yield, and electricity grid mix used in the manufacturing phase before it calculates the final results. The last steps involve interpreting the results, consulting stakeholders, and finally setting possible PV modules’ carbon footprint requirements.
Based on their analysis, the researchers propose the following alternative regulatory approach to the carbon footprint of PV modules: introducing general or parameter-specific quantitative requirements establishing a maximum admitted threshold for the carbon footprint of PV modules; requiring information on the carbon footprint of PV modules; and having that information reported on the product’s energy label or datasheet.
“Setting ecodesign requirements for the carbon footprint of PV modules could result in significant energy savings, in particular within the energy-intensive manufacturing stage of these products,” the authors concluded.
They noted that their proposals do not necessarily reflect the official position of the European Commission.

“The energy requirement needed for CO2 stripping is perhaps the most dominant factor governing solvent-based post-combustion capture technology,” Sintef's Senior Business Developer, Martin Bellmann, told pv magazine. “In essence, any technology that significantly reduces the so-called reboiler duty – energy consumption for CO2 striping – is highly sought after.”
The two companies described the new technology as a solar-assisted carbon capture system that either entirely or in part generates the thermal energy needed for gas separation.
“The proposed CPVT design is a single-axis tracking system of the type ‘linear through’, where the rows of curved mirrors are mechanically rotated so that the length-wise direction of the mirrors is always parallel to the incidental sunlight and follows the daily motion of the sun,” Bellmann added. “Concentration ratios of around 10 suns can be achieved.”
The CPVT receiver is based on a pipe with solar cell stripes attached to it. The small area of the CPVT receiver allows for the use of high-efficiency PV cells. “Although these PV cells are more expensive, the cost can be offset by the reduced area required,” Bellmann explained. “Conventional crystalline silicon and multi-junction cells are to be considered. Then, the price-to-performance ratio will be assessed once the prototype is up and running and we have collected sufficient enough data from the test trials.” 
According to Sintef, the efficient thermal management of the CPVT receiver is achieved by a heat transfer fluid circulating through the pipes. Cold fluid enters the pipe network at the inlet collecting the heat from the receiver and keeping the PV cells at low temperature. The collected heat is then transferred to a high-temperature heat pump (HTHP), which acts as an auxiliary thermal energy booster that upgrades waste heat and low-temperature heat from the receiver for steam production in the Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) process.
The electric power produced by the PV cells can either be supplied to the grid or used directly to power the HTHP or other auxiliary processes in the CCS process.
Sintef is currently working on the design and upscaling of the Svalin Solar plant design and plans to buy the components and set up a pilot facility in the summer of 2024. “Initially, the plant will be tested on dry land as part of an existing carbon capture facility that Sintef operates at Tiller, just outside Trondheim,” Bellmann stated. “To achieve a cost-efficient CPVT system design, it is crucial to understand if the annual energy production, both thermal and electric, can compensate for added costs for installation, tracking and maintenance.”
The demonstrator will be part of the EU-funded project “Transformation of energy intensive process industries through integration of energy, process, and feedstock flexibility” (TRINEFLEX), which has a total budget of €19.3 million ($21.2 million) and includes 28 partners.
Other researchers at Sintef recently developed a floating structure for offshore PV, a high-temperature industrial heat pump that can work with pure water as its work medium, and a floating solar platform for use in aquaculture projects.

The National Aeronautics and Space Association (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced the successful test deployment of a five-panel solar array that will power a weather satellite.
The satellite, GOES-U, is the fourth and final satellite in the GOES-R series. GOES-R is a collaboration with NASA and NOAA in which NASA builds and launches the satellite and NOAA operates it for weather event surveillance.
The satellites provide critical data for weather forecasts and warnings, detecting and monitoring environmental hazards like fire, smoke, fog, volcanic ash, and dust, and monitoring solar activity and space weather.
Lockheed Martin developed the solar array, a five-panel structure that carries 5 kW of capacity. This is equivalent to the power needed to run a home’s central air conditioning system. Each panel measures about 13 feet tall by 4.5 wide and weighs about 45 pounds.
At launch, the panels are folded together to protect them and ensure beneficial aerodynamics to reach orbit. Once in orbit, the panels will fold out on a single array wing that will rotate once per day, continuously pointing the solar cells toward the sun. During the test, engineers unfurled the five panels on railing that simulated a zero-gravity environment.
The PV cells are designed to convert enough sunlight into electricity to power the entire craft, including measurement instruments, computers, data processors, and telecommunications equipment.
The panels were manufactured at Lockheed Martin’s Littleton, Colorado facility, where the satellite was also constructed. GOES-U is scheduled for launch in April 2024.
Below is an artist concept video of a GOES-R satellite in action.
 
Solar in space
NASA has long used solar to power its spacecraft and satellites, and continues to use it for new missions today. In August 2022, NASA launched a tennis-court sized spacecraft, sending it on a 1.5-billion-mile journey to the asteroid Psyche, which the craft shares its name with. The Psyche craft is winged with two large cross-shaped solar arrays, which will power the craft’s measurement devices as well as its propulsion system.
Each array is 37.1 feet long and 24 feet wide when fully deployed. About an hour after launch, the arrays will deploy sequentially, first with the center column unfolding, and then the two cross-panels unfurling and latching into place. One wing at a time, the total deployment takes about seven and a half minutes.
This is the largest solar array deployed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said NASA. So large, in fact, that the entire craft could not be unfolded during the test at Arizona State University’s lab in Tempe, Ariz. ASU  partnered with NASA on this mission, which will observe the suspected unusually high amount of metals in the thickest band of the asteroid.
NASA launched the Webb Space Telescope on Christmas Day 2021, and thirty minutes later Webb’s fold-out solar array deployed and activated. The world’s most powerful telescope, set to study phenomena like the formation of planets, and the age and extent of the universe, uses less power than one might think. In fact, only one kilowatt, equivalent to the power used in microwaving your lunch, is needed to power the device.
Webb will stay energy-efficient more than 1 million miles from Earth, said NASA. The 20-foot solar array is attached to the main observatory of the craft. It will act as the ‘powerhouse’ for the telescope, supplying energy to all its scientific instruments, communications, and propulsion systems. Though the telescope only needs 1 kW to perform, the array generates twice that much to factor in the degradation caused by the harsh conditions of space.
