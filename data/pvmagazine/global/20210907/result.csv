Spanish solar project developer, Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) – part of UAE-based Abdul Latif Jameel Energy – and British developer Harmony Energy have begun work on the largest battery energy storage project in the United Kingdom.
The 99 MW/198 MWh Clay Tye facility is being constructed near the M25 in Essex and will rely on Tesla Megapack lithium-ion batteries.
Clay Tye follows the completion of the joint 34 MW/68 MWh Contego battery energy storage facility near Burgess Hill in West Sussex, which has now come online with a system of 28 Tesla Megapack batteries. That was the second project in the U.K. to use the Tesla Megapack, after the Holes Bay project, also developed by FRV and Harmony Energy, in 2020.
“The start-up of [the] Contego plant holds enormous significance for FRV, as it brings us closer to our goal of expanding our portfolio of energy storage projects internationally,” FRV CEO David Menéndez said. “It is the second one we have operating in the United Kingdom while we have another one under construction in Australia. In doing so, we are also making a significant contribution to the evolution towards a more sustainable energy model in the country, one of our strategic objectives as a company.”
The facilities will be connected to the UK Power Networks distribution network, which will allow energy storage and increase the flexibility of the U.K. national grid. “UK Power Networks connected the site to a local electricity substation via a new 1.4km underground cable that involved a 70m directional drill to overcome a special engineering challenge,” UK Power Networks said in a statement. “The company’s switchroom was modified to accommodate the new 33,000-volt circuit needed to import and export electricity from the electricity storage site.”

The section of the renewables paper devoted to solar, which was put out for consultation yesterday, noted: “Archaeological finds may be protected by a solar PV farm as the site is removed from regular plowing and ‘shoes', or low-level piling, is stipulated.”
The paper was published less than a week after Danish renewables developer European Energy announced it had donated almost €1 million to finance a dig next to the site of Italy's largest PV project, after a survey connected to the solar farm unearthed the remains of an early-to-middle neolithic settlement, and a basilica.
Pick up your copy of the September edition of pv magazine today for a detailed update on solar and battery storage in the United States, which faces a tough decision between taking advantage of Asian imports, or developing domestic manufacturing at the risk of slowing progress towards decarbonization.
The U.K. draft policy document is part of a suite of papers which will guide how energy infrastructure should be planned in England and Wales – and also Scotland, in the case of cross-border pipelines. With the guidance related to energy projects big enough to require central government consent – under the nationally significant infrastructure projects (NSIP) regime – dating from 2011, the U.K.'s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) wants to update policy with a net-zero 2050 in mind.
The significant change proposed for solar is that project scale be determined by total inverter capacity, in alternating current terms, rather than by the current method of measuring the generation capacity, in direct current, of the panels on a site. The thresholds under which projects enter the NSIP planning regime are unchanged, and apply to solar farms bigger than 50 MWac in England, and larger than 350 MW in Wales.
In addition to highlighting the archaeological gains which may be offered by PV, the draft policy document concerned with solar – which will be open to consultation until November 29 – also noted potential biodiversity and water management benefits at solar sites, and dismissed the myth about airplane pilots being affected by glare from panels.
“Solar farms have the potential to increase the biodiversity value of a site, especially if the land was previously intensively managed” stated the document, adding: “Solar sites can deliver existing ecosystem services value in the form of drainage, flood attenuation, natural wetland habitat, and water quality management.”
On glare, the BEIS draft policy paper said: “There is no evidence that glint and glare from solar farms interferes in any way with aviation navigation or pilot and aircraft visibility or safety.”
The planning guidance paper based its suggestions on the assumption typical solar panels would be around 2m2, have an output of 450 W each and would require around 2-4 acres per megawatt capacity of sites. Panels would be assumed to lose 1% of their performance annually through degradation and would have a 25-30 year lifespan, leading to planning authorities to grant a typical time limit of 25 years for a solar farm.
An archaeological dig financed by Danish clean power company European Energy unearthed archaeological treasures including ceramics, coins, bracelets, rings and buckles dating from the Daunian period of occupation at the site in Troia, Apulia where the developer's 103 MW solar project is generating power for sale on the spot market. The project is set to sell electricity to the Italian unit of Swiss energy company Axpo and is trading on the open market while it awaits closure of the power purchase agreement.

The offering will include a fully-autonomous-enabled, hydrogen-powered container transporter; a heavy-duty vehicle with fuel-cell electric vehicle charging facilities; and a drone for operations such as fire-fighting and life-saving. Chairman Chung Eui-sun said the company's hydrogen plans are not restricted to transport, adding: “Hyundai Motor Group’s vision is to apply hydrogen energy in all areas of life and industry, such as our homes, workplaces and factories. The goal is to make hydrogen readily used for everyone, everything, and everywhere.” Hyundai is one of the founding partners of a national hydrogen council that may be launched tomorrow, alongside conglomerates SK Corp and Lotte Corp, and steelmaker POSCO.
Düsseldorf-based energy company Uniper and the Port of Rotterdam Authority intend to produce green hydrogen at the Uniper site on the Maasvlakte extension to the port which was built on land reclaimed from the sea. “These plans build on the findings of a recent feasibility study and are in line with the new hydrogen infrastructure that has been planned, and the growing demand for sustainable hydrogen from the Rotterdam petrochemical industry,” read a note released yesterday. Rotterdam currently hosts half of the Netherlands hydrogen projects which have been designated important projects of common European interest (IPCEIs) by the European Commission, and the Uniper plan is also on the IPCEI shortlist. “The Uniper hydrogen plant is to be connected to the HyTransport.RTM pipeline that runs through the Port of Rotterdam,” stated the press release, in reference to the hydrogen gas pipeline being planned by the port and state-owned energy company Gasunie. “The pipeline also connects the Uniper plant to the national hydrogen infrastructure and the Delta Corridor pipeline bundle. The latter project is intended for delivering hydrogen to chemical clusters in Moerdijk and Geleen (Chemelot) [a chemicals industry cluster at the city of Geleen] and farther away, in North Rhine-Westphalia.”
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has selected domestic engineer JGC Holdings Corp to carry out a feasibility study on a project for the introduction of green hydrogen and ammonia to Azerbaijan. “This project aims to conduct a feasibility study on the development of facilities and infrastructure for the production of green hydrogen and ammonia through the use of solar and wind power, for the Republic of Azerbaijan – using Japanese technology and expertise; and to formulate a roadmap for the future large scale production of green ammonia for power generation and export, and for the development of related infrastructure,” read a note published yesterday. JGC said Azerbaijan is an ideal location for solar and wind power generation, especially near the Caspian Sea, and is near consumer markets in Europe, the Middle East, and Russia. “In addition, the country has an existing ammonia plant and … domestic transport infrastructure for fertilizer, making it a potential location for future green hydrogen and ammonia projects,” added the press release.
The government of Western Australia has announced an additional AU$61.5 million (€38.4 million) investment in the region’s renewable hydrogen industry. “A new [AU]$50 million [€31.3 million] fund, included in the [Mark] McGowan [state] government's 2021-22 budget will be used to stimulate local demand for renewable hydrogen in transport and industrial settings, and to drive investment into renewable hydrogen,” read a statement released today. The funds aim to upgrade infrastructure at the Oakajee strategic industrial area to establish a renewable hydrogen hub. The state government has committed AU$7.5 million [€4.7 million] for roads, and AU$4 million for additional infrastructure. “The new funding commitment comes as the McGowan government progresses a[n AU]$900,000 [€564,000] investment towards three industry-led feasibility studies into renewable hydrogen projects across the state,” added the note, mentioning energy business BP Australia, Sydney-based professional services company APT Management Services, and the Global Energy Ventures developer planning the vast Asian Renewable Energy Hub in the state. APT will assess the potential conversion of the Parmelia gas pipeline into a 100% hydrogen facility and Global Energy Ventures will receive funds for feasibility studies on opportunities to export green hydrogen to the Asia-Pacific market.
German car giant BMW has said its focus is on the circular economy and sustainable urban mobility, at today's opening of the IAA Mobility motor show in Munich. BMW displayed several battery electric vehicles, including all-electric models the iX and i4 and also presented the BMW Concept iX5 Hydrogen Protection VR6 model, which it claims is the world’s first certified security vehicle with a hydrogen fuel cell drive train. “With this concept car, the BMW Group underlines both the importance of hydrogen fuel cell technology for the locally CO2-free mobility of tomorrow and its ability to master completely new challenges in the development of safety vehicles – while still pursuing sustainable solutions,” the carmaker said.
London-based Hydrogen Utopia International (HUI) and German chemical company Linde are in their final stage of signing a mutual contract for syngas production. “The feasibility study envisaged a plant to be jointly developed by Linde, HUI and Powerhouse Energy (PHE), located in Konin in central Poland,” stated a press release issued on Sunday. “The plan is to convert 40 tons of plastic waste into 58 MWh of renewable electricity and clean hydrogen per day. Once the plant is realized, the hydrogen will be used locally, as a fuel for city buses and other heavy-duty vehicles, as well as for passenger cars.” The project is subject to funding approval by the EU's Just Transition Fund – which aims to disburse energy transition cash in areas traditionally dependent on fossil fuel industries. The Polish government will match fund any European backing for the project.

Hydrogen production is the leader in this space, and even this struggles to keep up with the costs and efficiency of batteries. However, a group of scientists working to understand the genetics of a bacteria called Shewanella oneidensis, say they have made a rare discovery that could open up pathways to engineering different bacteria to produce synthetic fuels from carbon dioxide and electricity.
“There are only a very small number of microbes that can really store renewable electricity,” said Buz Barstow, assistant professor of biological and environmental engineering at Cornell University. “We want to make one. And in order to do that we need to know the genes that are involved in getting the electrons into the cell.”
The group created a technique it calls ‘knockout sudoku’, where it inactivates individual genes to determine their function. Using this, they were able to identify a new set of genes that is central to the initial electron uptake process that would make energy storage possible. “We found a lot of genes that we already knew about for getting electrons out of the cell are also involved in getting electrons in,” Barstow said. “Then we also found this totally new set of genes that nobody's ever seen before that are needed to get electrons into the cell.”
The pathway for these electrons is outlined in the paper Identification of a pathway for electron uptake in Shewanella oneidensis, published in communications biology. The group found that the electron uptake process is highly efficient and could easily be scaled up. They were also able identify similar genes in many different bacteria. Barstow says he plans to experiment with adding the newly discovered genes to E-coli – since this is one of the most studied and well understood bacteria. The researchers also state several other pathways – optimizing the shewanella oneidensis bacteria, and studying other metal-oxidizing microbes, will be opened up by this research.
“Engineered bacteria powered by electrons opens the door for using renewable energy for making biofuels, food, chemicals, and for carbon sequestration,” the group concluded.

The Solarge DUO panel is based on M10 PERC cells and weighs 50% less than conventional glass-backsheet panels, with a rooftop load of just 6 kg/m2, the company claimed.
“The module configuration is the typical east-west configuration with 12 degrees tilt angle, which can basically be installed on the roof in any desired orientation,” CCO Huib Van der Heuvel told pv magazine. “The mounting system is fixed to the roof by means of roofing anchors, eliminating the need for ballast.”
The product measures 2,327 mm x 1,137 mm x 14 mm and weighs in at 14.5 kg, or 5.5 kg/m2. It features a power output of 500 W, an open-circuit voltage of 49 V, a short-circuit current of 12.4 A, and a fill factor of 0.78%. Its temperature coefficient is -0.39% per degree Celsius and the maximum system voltage is 1,000 V. The operating ambient temperature ranges from -40 to 85 C.
Solarge offers a 10-year product warranty and a 20-year power output guarantee. Annual linear degradation over 20 years is guaranteed at a maximum of 0.5 %.
The manufacturer is currently producing the modules through a pilot line at its manufacturing facility in Eindhoven, in the Netherlands. It is now completing the financing of a high-volume manufacturing plant, which is scheduled to open by mid-2022 in the Netherlands. Commercial operations are scheduled to start in the second half of next year.
“Next to the low weight, the sustainability performance of this innovative solar panels are remarkable,” Van der Heuve said. “The product will have a CO2 footprint which is 80% lower than conventional solar panels and the panel is completely circular in design and uses no Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) materials, unlike all other solar panels that use a polymeric film instead of glass.”

The result was confirmed by Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE).
The device was fabricated through a low-temperature co-evaporation method for the growth of the light-absorbing CIGS semiconductor thin film. EMPA scientist Shiro Nishiwaki optimized the composition of the layer and alkaline dopants to achieve improved performance.
The researchers analyzed the effects of combined exposure to heat and light and found an increase in photovoltaic performance, which they claim remains stable after several months.
The research team that achieved the record efficiency is led by the head of the laboratory for thin films and photovoltaics, Ayodhya Tiwari, who pv magazine interviewed in August, on the future of CIGS technology. “The flexible and lightweight solar modules resulting from this technology are particularly suitable for applications on roofs and facades of buildings, greenhouses, transport vehicles, airships and portable electronic devices,” he said in a statement. “EMPA collaborates with the Swiss company Flisom for the manufacture of flexible and lightweight solar modules by roll-to-roll processes for such applications.”

In DSTH projects, the electricity generated by a PV unit is used to directly drive water-splitting redox reactions without the need for an electrolyzer or complex power infrastructure. Commercial viability, however, is far from being achieved, despite efficiencies close to 19%, due to the use of expensive semiconductors and noble-metal catalysts. “Our demonstrated system uses inexpensive semiconductors and low-cost, Ni-based catalysts, presenting a great potential for scaling up,” researcher Siva Karuturi told pv magazine. “Further work on [the] design of large scale water splitting cells, together [with the] commercial availability of tandem perovskite-silicon solar cells could ultimately pave the way for industrial production.”
The integrated water-splitting cell developed by the Australian group is based on a “flower-stem” morphology and is planned to rely on a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrode made of NiMo alloy, which is a non-noble-metal-based efficient catalyst for HER due to its appropriate hydrogen binding energy and excellent alkali corrosion. This electrode is then coupled with an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode made of low-cost nickel-iron alloy (NiFE) that, in turn, offers an excellent OER catalytic activity.
DSHT systems are usually built with two or more single PV cells, due to the relatively high voltage requirements of the water-splitting reaction. The demonstrated system, by contrast, is powered by a single, 24.3%-efficient tandem perovskite-silicon solar cell based on a perovskite cell with a power conversion efficiency of 15.3%, an “unprecedented” open-circuit voltage of 1.271 V, a short circuit current density of 17.8 mA/cm-2, and a fill factor of 68%. “The high voltage obtained in our work proved to be decisive in optimal matching of the power generated by the tandem cell and the energy needed by the catalyst electrodes to split water, thereby resulting in high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency,” Karuturi explained.
The surface of the perovskite layer was passivated with an organic cation known as n-dodecylammonium bromide (C12H28BrN), which consists of a long alkyl chain. The tandem cell was linked to the cell catalyst electrodes with wired connections.
The scientists said their analysis demonstrated that the proposed system may achieve solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 20% at a levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) estimated at $4.10/kg. “Improving solely the perovskite cell could enhance the STH efficiency close to 25%,” they concluded. “Combined with future reductions in the PV panel and membrane costs, an LCOH of $2.30/kg-1 could be achieved, presenting a remarkable opportunity to realize cheap renewable hydrogen.”
The findings of the research can be found in the paper Direct Solar Hydrogen Generation at 20% Efficiency Using Low-Cost Materials, which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials. “To make the DSTH technology practically viable, essential next steps are: reactor optimization to produce H2 gas at scale in a cost-effective manner, and achiev[ing the] technology readiness needed for market adoption,” Karuturi concluded.

The award was presented in a virtual ceremony this morning, as part of the opening of the annual EU PVSEC conference, which is being held virtually this week.
The Becquerel Prize – named for Alexandre Edmund Becquerel, who first discovered the photovoltaic effect – has been given since 1989 to scientists who have made an outstanding contribution to photovoltaics. Hosting the award ceremony earlier today, Christophe Ballif, chair of the Becquerel Committee, said that Jahn was chosen for her “outstanding and continuous contribution to the field, which is extremely important and sometimes underestimated in its difficulty, of the quality performance and assessment of photovoltaics modules and systems.”
Since publishing her first paper in 1992, Jahn has worked to better understand many of the degradation mechanisms affecting PV systems, and has developed methods to mitigate them. Giving a summary of her career, fellow renowned PV scientists Thomas Nordmann singled out Jahn’s leadership of the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems program, where she has led a group focused on the performance, operation and reliability of PV systems for more than 25 years. He also noted that this is a responsibility she has kept on alongside several full-time jobs that have also been focused on ensuring quality and reliability in PV products.
“I am overwhelmed by the recognition I have received, and still not convinced that I deserve all these honors,” Jahn told the audience. “I understand this award as recognition for all the people in the PV community, and especially the IEA PVPS Task 13 experts who have contributed to this work.”
In her acceptance lecture, Jahn noted the importance of big data and digitalization to ensuring long-term reliability for solar energy systems.
“Solar bankability must be data driven. Big data is available, but it needs to be better organized and digitized, relying on interconnected platforms,” she told the audience. “Digitalization is the driver to ensure cost-effective increase of quality.”
She concluded the lecture by outlining her wish for the solar industry to see massive manufacturing capacity increases, particularly in Europe, as well as the development of a fully circular economy for solar energy materials, and the integration of solar within a range of applications and environments.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/07/responsible-land-use-for-pv-wind-could-smooth-indian-energy-transition/,"MARKETS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2021","Responsible land use for PV, wind could smooth Indian energy transition","From pv magazine India
India needs to judiciously plan land use for solar and wind generation to achieve its renewable energy ambitions, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).  
The report shows that if India were to achieve a net-zero target by 2050, solar could occupy 50,000 to 75,000 square kilometers (km2) of land. Wind could use another 1,500 to 2,000 km2 for turbines, substations, roads, and buildings, or 15,000 to 20,000 km2 if the total project sites are included, including space between turbines and other infrastructure. The amount of land that could be needed for solar is equivalent to 1.7% to 2.5% of India’s total landmass, or 2.2% to 3.3% of non-forested land. 
The report’s author, Dr. Charles Worringham, said that the higher end of the land-use range is deliberately generous, in order to allow plenty of leeway for planning. “This is a precautionary approach for the purposes of planning and putting in place smart land-use policies today for future renewable infrastructure,” he said.
Worringham said that the locations for renewable energy can be chosen using India’s preferred social and environmental criteria and can be widely distributed across the country. “Additional coal can only come from already heavily mined districts or from new coal blocks, which are often in significant forest areas,” he said. “Nor does renewable energy permanently alter land and natural resources in the same way as coal.”
The report notes the potential for land-use conflicts over renewable energy installations, even in sparsely populated areas, to slow down the rollout of infrastructure.
“Whether or not India commits to a mid-century net-zero emissions target, its huge expansion of renewable energy capacity over the coming decades will enhance energy security enormously, but this requires a large amount of land for infrastructure,” said Worringham. “The energy transition will also require important choices about where this infrastructure should be located. But careful planning and solutions like agrivoltaics, distributed energy systems, and offshore wind can also greatly reduce the potential for renewable generation to conflict with social and environmental values whilst diversifying and strengthening India’s national grid. By bringing more generation closer to both urban and rural loads, transmission costs could also be kept in check.”
Key recommendations
The report looks at how to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of land use for the energy transition. The recommendations for policymakers fall into three categories:
1. Minimizing total land-use requirements through offshore wind, distributed rooftop solar, and solar on artificial bodies of water.
2. Optimizing the identification and assessment of land. Measures include developing clear environmental and social criteria for rating potential sites and undertaking comprehensive independent assessments of potential sites. Tenders must be designed to incentivize the use of the highest-ranked locations, or those of least environmental and social concern. In addition, there needs to be support for widely distributed renewable generation at different scales.
3. Increasing the stock of potentially suitable geographically diverse land by boosting the uptake of agrivoltaics where crops, soil, and conditions are suitable and yields can be maintained or improved. 
Agricultural land has the potential to host a much larger proportion of renewable generation. It could provide a boost to rural economies and reduce pressure on other land, according to the report. An Indian agrivoltaics sector could also provide benefits to farmers, including second income streams, said Worringham.
