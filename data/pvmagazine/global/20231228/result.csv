Voith.
Voith has developed a unique technology to control and balance large-scale high-voltage VRFB energy storage systems. The technology complements LIVA's large-scale VRFB systems. LIVA plans to integrate the technology into its large-scale energy storage systems.
“This acquisition is an important building block for LIVA to further expand the attractiveness of the VRFB technology,” said LIVA CEO Volker Kölln. “By integrating the Voith IP, we can improve the energy efficiency of electricity storage while reducing system costs. Highly efficient and reliable mass energy storage systems are the key to the energy transition in industry and for grid management applications.”
LIVA and Voith will continue to cooperate in the field of industrial and grid-scale energy storage systems in the future, AMG said in a statement.
In 2022, LIVA began operating its first hybrid energy storage system, which combines lithium batteries and vanadium redox flow batteries.

The MOU, which was also signed by Egypt's New and Renewable Energy Authority and Egyptian Electricity Holding Co., paves the way for preliminary studies to develop the project. It is expected to produce about 29,784 GWhj of electricity per year, helping to reduce around 14 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions and annually saving more than $1 billion in natural gas costs.
The project is part of Egypt’s broader “Green Corridor Initiative,” which aims to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce dependence on fossil fuels as part of the country's efforts for sustainable development.
“This project aligns with Egypt’s goals to increase the participation of renewable energy sources in the energy mix to 42% by 2030 and the National Climate Strategy 2050,” said Minister of Electricity Mohamed Shaker.
The project strengthens the historical ties between Egypt and China and confirms the ability of Egypt's renewable energy sector to attract foreign direct investments, said Shaker.
In November, Egypt’s Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE) signed agreements with Chinese partners to invest $15.6 billion in 11 manufacturing and green hydrogen projects.

The grid-connected system has an installed PV capacity of 400 MW.
The project is equipped with a 1,500 VDC energy storage system, consisting of 10 Trina Storage 2.5 MW/5 MWh battery cabinets. The storage units have robust maintenance systems, using precision thermal management technology for uniform heat dissipation at the rack level, increasing battery life, said Trina Storage.
The system, which is installed on fish ponds, allows energy to be generated on the water and can be used at the same time for fish farming, combining sustainable agriculture with the most advanced science and technology, the company said.
“These integrated efforts bring multiple benefits, such as land preservation, energy efficiency, emissions reduction, improved business productivity, and increased farmer income, thereby positively contributing to both the economy and the environment,” it claimed. “[It] achieves a harmonious integration of photovoltaics and energy storage, enabling energy switching, primary frequency regulation and various related applications.”
Trina Storage introduced its latest generation of commercial-scale batteries, Trina Storage Elementa 2 at the All-Energy Australia in October. The 4 MWh energy storage system offers “a solid foundation for integrated PV and energy storage solutions,” the company states.
“Elementa 2 was specially designed to meet the needs of commercial-scale energy storage customers and markets,” it said. “With a high energy density, it fits comfortably in a 20-foot container, streamlining transportation and logistics, and pursuing cost reduction and economic efficiency.”

Victoria government-owned agency Energy Safe Victoria (ESV) had directed Enel Green Power to cease generating power at the Cohuna Solar Farm after initial investigations into the fire raised concerns about specific equipment used at the solar farm.
ESV, the technical regulator responsible for the safe generation, supply and use of electricity, gas and pipelines in Victoria, said the operator of the solar farm was on Dec. 8 directed to disconnect equipment, following a 3-hectare to 4-hectare grassfire at the 82-hectare site in November.
Enel told pv magazine that ESV had directed it to disconnect some equipment at the site but the plant has since resumed operations.
“Following works in accordance with directions provided by ESV, the Cohuna Solar Farm recommenced generating on Dec. 17,” Enel said. “The plant is now operating at approximately 75% capacity and is currently ramping up generation to full capacity.”
Enel said it is working closely with ESV to comply with all relevant directions.
ESV Chief Executive Officer Leanne Hughson said early investigations into the fire had sparked concerns about specific equipment used at the solar farm located near Horfield, about 250 kilometers northwest of the state capital, Melbourne. The plant comprises about 87,000 bifacial modules mounted on single-axis trackers.
“The operation of modern solar farms is generally safe but on the rare occasion we see a fault with specific equipment we will investigate,” she said.
The ESV said the operator was required to carried out inspections and implement interim safety measures prior to the solar plant, which has been in operations since 2021, being powered up again. The agency said the operator is working to find a permanent solution to help ensure the issue does not happen again, while also working closely with the ESV to comply with the current direction.
The news comes just days after Enel Green Power, owned by Italy's Enel Group and Japanese oil and gas major Inpex, signed a long-term offtake agreement with the Japanese owned retailer SmartestEnergy for its 93 MW Girgarre solar project in Victoria.
Enel Green Power also has a stake in the Bungala 1 and Bungala 2 solar farms, which deliver a combined 220 MW of generation capacity into the grid in South Australia and is building the 75.6 MW Flat Rocks Wind Farm in Western Australia.

A year ago, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved NEM 3.0, a rule-making decision implemented in April 2023 that slashed compensation for exported rooftop solar generation by roughly 80%.
Now, several months after implementation, the impact of NEM 3.0 has become clear. Utility interconnection queues show an 80% drop in installation applications. The California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) reported that nearly 17,000 rooftop solar jobs, about 22% of the workforce, were lost this year as a result.
Solar Insure, which backs many installation companies in the state, told pv magazine USA that its data shows 75% of solar installers are now in the “high-risk” category following CPUC’s decision to implement NEM 3.0.
“We have seen a wave of recent solar installer bankruptcies and believe another wave will come in Q1 2024,” said Ara Agopian, chief executive officer of Solar Insure.
Despite public protest and industry warnings of devastating effects, the CPUC ruled in favor of its private investor-owned utilities. These utilities pushed forward the assumptions of NEM 3.0 based on a call for equity and fairness, saying that renters were being left behind by rooftop solar. Not long after pushing the policy through, CPUC revealed the equity concerns were merely talk, and it moved through further rule-making decisions that made it harder for renters reap the benefits of rooftop solar.
Thanks to the help of Governor Gavin Newsom’s appointed CPUC board, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), San Diego Gas and Electric’s parent conglomerate Sempra, and Southern California Edison (SCE), achieved the market conditions they desired. The three companies have a market cap of roughly $120 billion, and they have successfully fixed the market to punish small rooftop solar installers and support utility-scale development instead.
In a decision this week, the Court of Appeal of the First Appellate District reaffirmed CPUC’s decision to implement NEM 3.0, despite the bankruptcy and job loss data. CALSSA said this came as no surprise, as the 2013 legislation requiring a reevaluation of net metering and the CPUC rule-making process itself has been “stacked against solar since the beginning.”
The devastating job losses, bankruptcies, and unabashed regulatory moat building around the profits of a hundred-billion-plus corporate beast calls into question the legislative foundations of Gavin Newsom’s appointed CPUC board.
California’s electricity prices have exploded over the last three years, far outpacing inflation. Without rooftop solar as a thorn in its side, the state’s utilities can continue to reap profits in a de facto monopoly.
The market conditions have led to a rise in “grid defection,” where customers cut the cord and rely on their own solar assets to power their home. As solar equipment costs inherently go down over time, grid defection could represent an existential threat to private utilities. Current legislation makes it very difficult to defect from the grid, and CPUC’s pro-utility attitude could likely place this at risk for being legislated out in the future, further placing Californians at the mercy of rising utility prices.

The Chilean government has approved a resolution to allocate public land for energy storage projects that will start operations in 2026.
The Promotion Plan for the Development of Storage Systems is expected to assign public land for projects with a total aggregate capacity of 13 GWh, distributed mainly in the country's four northernmost regions: Arica y Parinacota, Tarapacá, Antofagasta and Atacama.
The plan was initially outlined in the “Study of Energy Storage in the National Electrical System,” presented earlier this year by the National Electrical Coordinator. It noted that “the optimal storage levels should be located mainly in the northern area of the SEN [National Electricity System], with capacities between 1,000 MW and 4,000 MW and with a duration of six to eight hours, in the period 2026-30.”
The National Electrical Coordinator noted that there is also an estimated initial investment of around $3.16 billion by 2026 “for a capacity of 2,000 MW or 13.2 GWh.”

The project was kicked off in November to improve the penetration of BIPV in the global solar market.
The researchers said that despite many years of development, BIPV is still a solar market niche, contributing only 7 GW to the overall cumulative installed PV capacity of 209 GW in Europe in 2022.
The project involves several work items, including installing BIPV systems at industrial, residential, offices, historical buildings, and a vertical sound barrier at four locations across Europe.
The companies involved include French building information modeling (BIM) software company Enerbim, Cyprus-based engineering company Stratagem Energy and  Over Easy Solar, a Norwegian vertical PV for rooftop specialist. In addition, four Spanish companies are participating, namely Izpitek Solar, the aluminum manufacturer Acucoil, industrial design company Branka Solutions and BIPV solution developer Sunthalpy Engineering.
Also on board are several Dutch companies, including project management company BIPV Projects*, mounting system developer Tulipps, and circular materials platform provider Madaster Shared Services. In addition, Ticino-based PV Venetian blinds company iWin Innovative Windows and Silla Industries, an Italian electric mobility company, are participating.
The research teams and associations involved include the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) in Germany, Spanish groups Fundación Cidetec and Tecnalia Research & Innovation, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the Italian Energy and Sustainable Development Association, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI) and the German Federal Green Building Association.
The project received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe program and is coordinated by Fraunhofer ISE. The total estimated cost of the project is €8.67 million ($9.6 million), with the European Union providing €7.19 million.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/12/28/more-pv-installers-looking-for-orders-system-prices-under-pressure/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,GERMANY",MICHAEL FUHS,"DECEMBER 28, 2023","More PV installers looking for orders, system prices under pressure","From pv magazine Germany
Tim Rosengart: After having an extremely strong August and September, homeowner demand plummeted in October to about half. We see this not only on our platform, but also among our installation companies, especially smaller companies who are desperately looking for orders. We see this with large providers based on Google click prices. The demand for ads on Google has increased dramatically, with prices increasing by almost 50%. This is quantitative evidence that organic demand has fallen.
For Selfmade Energy they are relatively unimportant because we get most of our users through informative posts on our site and through partnerships, such as with Verivox, preisvergleich.de and Finanztip. The fact that prices at Google have risen extremely sharply shows that many companies have to spend a lot of money to get the order quantities that they previously got cheaper.
Last year, everyone who was basically thinking about it and had the money bought a solar system. The market was dominated by panic. 2022 was therefore extremely good and everyone expected 2023 to be even better and took that into account in their purchasing planning. You have purchased many components, hired employees and are now pushing this cost item ahead of you. People continue to buy solar systems, for example, when they see the neighbors have one. But the pressure to buy one now, as there was last year, is gone. In addition, last year you got money for 1% interest while inflation was high at the same time. Now the interest rates are significantly higher, so you can invest your money elsewhere.
This is devastating, absolutely devastating. I can only shake my head at how one can do politics so amateurishly. You can't tell people that there are €500 million and then €300 million are gone after a day — and when the next €200 million will come, I have no idea. In winter there is no sun anyway and people are now waiting for funding. Our customers notice that orders are being canceled.
If a solar company decides to work with Selfmade Energy, a cooperation agreement is signed that also regulates data protection. Our solar companies can then enter exclusion criteria. What requirements do you have as a solar company for your orders? For example, do you only want to work on end-of-terrace houses, not middle-of-terrace houses? Or do you only install on detached houses, for example? Which roof coverings do you use? We can guarantee that you will only be referred to customers with these specifications. You must enter the zip code regions in which you offer. So that we can automatically create the indicative offers, you must fill out a table. You must specify which components you offer as standard and how much systems with 10, 11, 12 modules and so on cost. With us, the end customers see this price and that is very important — it is an indicative price that you can change later. You can also provide further information about yourself as a company, such as the fact that you are a regional company, or if you specialize in components from a specific manufacturer, or how quickly you can install. We try to work with the solar companies to find out their unique selling points. We can also see in our price atlas how you are priced in a postal code area.
Our data shows that the cheapest ones are not always chosen. The most expensive provider is also chosen almost equally because it offers a particularly long guarantee. Others are clicked particularly well because they are regional providers.
If an offer from a solar company is displayed on our site so that customers who have been looking for an offer see it, the companies pay a small amount for it. When customers contact the solar companies and they receive a lead, they also pay an amount. This is significantly cheaper than what you pay for an advertisement on Google. We have recently also started offering data products that our customers can use to optimize themselves.
For example, we offer a Germany-wide solar price atlas. This pricing atlas allows solar companies to see how they compare to their competition based on key dimensions, such as the price including battery for a certain number of modules.
Yes. And this is not our comparison's fault, but rather it is clearly due to current market events and consumers' reluctance to buy.
Yes. In January, a large provider that operates throughout Germany asked for €26,000 for a 10 kW system including battery storage in Bavaria. In July it was only €18,500. That's a decrease of 28%. But even more important is the time it takes to install. Compared to the same month last year, this time has decreased from six to 12 months to one month.
We have another tool, which is churn analysis. This allows us to analyze who our users select when other companies are included. We can see that professional local companies with high-quality offerings are very well received by Selfmade Energy users.
No.
On average, yes, but not necessarily. There are also many outliers at the regional level.
pv magazine is a brand that is increasingly read by end customers and has a wide reach. In addition, it is read by many regional companies that can be entered in the business directory. It is of course extremely attractive for end customers to go into the business directory and search for the companies there. We offer companies that are listed in the business directory the opportunity to test our offer comparison. We are interested in more regional solar companies coming to us. For us, it is also a great opportunity to present ourselves as a company.

“This technological breakthrough is attributed to the successful practices of the company's R&D team in the development and validation of low reflectivity texture technology, front boron plus rear-oxidized high sheet resistance technology, LPCVD and Phosphorus diffusion matching process, ultra-narrow line width printing and metallization technology, rear-side special multi-busbar technology, and laser-induced firing technology,” the company said in a statement.

While largely seen as a good fit for stationary storage applications, a number of companies are exploring their potential in mobility applications, including battery industry behemoths CATL and BYD.
The latest company to unveil its own sodium-ion technology is China-based two-wheeler specialist TAILG. The company is implementing the technology in its luxury e-bike range for the mid-to-premium consumer market.
With the global electric two-wheeler market growing at a rate of over 20% per year, TAILG aims to capitalize on its first-mover advantage to create a complete ecosystem for long-range, sodium-ion battery-powered, light electric vehicles.
According to TAILG, its sodium-ion battery has a super long range, capable of reaching 115 kilometers even in temperatures below 0 C, while maintaining a speed of 25 kmh.
The lifecycle exceeds 2,000 cycles. The battery retains about 93% of its capacity in temperatures as low as -20 C, making it ideal for winter use. The battery's safety performance also exceeds industry standards due to the IPX7-grade waterproof technology that covers the entire pack, said the company.
Sodium-ion batteries are often touted as the most promising alternative to ubiquitous lithium-ion technology. A recent research paper authored by researchers at Sweden's Chalmers University found that sodium-ion batteries have “considerably lower mineral resource scarcity impacts than nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC)-type LIB cells in a cradle-to-gate perspective, while their global warming impacts are on par.”
According to the research team, sodium-ion batteries end up between 60 and just over 100 kilograms of CO2e per kWh (theoretical) electricity storage capacity.
“This is lower than previously reported for this type of sodium-ion battery,” says Rickard Arvidsson, associate professor of environmental systems analysis at Chalmers University. “It’s clearly a promising technology.”
The researchers have also identified a number of measures with the potential to further reduce climate impact, such as developing an environmentally better electrolyte, as it accounts for a large part of the battery's total impact. They also recommended the use of hard carbon anodes.

However, one of the most promising startups in the field, Germany's CMBlu Energy, recently pulled in more than $100 million in investments and is gradually expanding its market presence.
CMBlu’s technology recently caught the attention of the DoE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), which has tasked two prestigious labs, the DoE’s Argonne National Laboratory and Idaho National Laboratory, with validating its credentials.
Over the course of the project, Argonne and Idaho National Laboratory will deploy and evaluate CMBlu Energy’s Organic SolidFlow battery technology with the goal to provide insights for bolstering the resilience of microgrids. The project also seeks to make fast charging of electric vehicles more affordable in rural and underserved communities by reducing charging facility installation and operational costs.
OCED selected the initiative in September to be one of six demonstration projects as part of a long-duration energy storage lab call.
“We’re honored to participate in this project with two preeminent research teams that are advancing clean energy,” said Ben Kaun, president of CMBlu Energy. “The unique capabilities and resources of Argonne and [Idaho National Laboratory] will enable CMBlu to accelerate the commercialization of our Organic SolidFlow battery solution. Our long-duration energy storage is designed to support grid resilience and integration for EV fast charging and microgrid applications, and this demonstration is an excellent opportunity to validate its real-world performance.”
The project will span two regions. In the Midwest, Argonne researchers plan to demonstrate the effectiveness of CMBlu’s technology at the lab’s Smart Energy Plaza. The plaza is a fully renovated and repurposed gas station designed to conduct research on the integration and management of electric vehicle charging, renewables, building systems, and energy storage. Argonne researchers will gather data and analyze how the technology can inform real-world scenarios.
“Demonstration projects, especially those at national labs, efficiently mature our understanding of new technologies in key use cases,” said battery scientist Sue Babinec, program lead for stationary storage at Argonne. “This collaborative project will validate CMBlu’s Organic SolidFlow battery while providing a path for expansion of electric vehicles to underserved communities.”
At the Idaho National Laboratory Battery Test Center in Idaho, researchers will conduct performance tests, including assessing how well the Organic SolidFlow batteries perform at different temperatures. This rigorous testing is crucial to ensure the technology's reliability in diverse environments. The Idaho National Laboratory center serves as the DoE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s (EERE) primary center for battery life and performance testing.
“This awarded work provides a unique avenue to showcase the strengths of [Idaho National Laboratory] and Argonne to explore flow battery performance at colder-than-room temperatures, relevant to energy storage needs at northern latitudes and winter conditions,” said Kevin Gering, a distinguished staff scientist at Idaho National Laboratory. “We are enthusiastic about applying our collective expertise to understand CMBlu’s Organic SolidFlow battery’s performance so the technology can find those critical niches it can thrive within.”
While other redox flow batteries use metal ions, CMBlu’s Organic SolidFlow batteries use carbon-based molecules for its electrolytes. According to the company, certain carbon-based molecules have the intrinsic ability to be oxidized and reduced or charged and discharged. These molecules are essential elements in the “redox” reactions that power all living cells. 
Energy converter stacks are at the heart of CMBlu’s modular redox flow battery technology. Both reduction and oxidation take place in these stacks although separate from each other. According to CMBlu, the battery output depends on the material and surface area of the electrodes, as well as the kinetics of the redox process. Increasing the stack size yields a higher output.
CMBlu fills two separate storage tanks with a solid polymer and then transfers it to and from the liquid electrolyte, which is pumped into an electrode stack for charging and discharging cycles.
The company's storage technology is intended for use in large-scale, multi-hour stationary projects. The company says it has a “potentially unlimited” cycle life with proper maintenance. It offers up to 90% efficiency, approaching the 95% efficiency of lithium-ion batteries. It can be easily scaled to GWh scale, says CMBlu. The technology is touted as non-flammable.
The company is currently developing multiple pilot projects in the United States and Europe to demonstrate its technology. It has active projects with WEC Energy Group in Wisconsin, Salt River Project in Arizona, and several sites in Europe, including Austrian energy supplier Burgerland Energie's 300 MWh project.
CMBlu was among the winners of the 2018 pv magazine Annual Award for its organic flow battery tech.

HPOT, also known as laser power transmission, is an approach that uses a monochromatic light source to transfer continuous power to a remote system via an optical photovoltaic converter (OPC).
“Within the upcoming year, we aim to initiate the manufacture of OPCs based on indium gallium nitride (InGaN) and indium aluminum nitride (InAlN) as proof of concept, laying the groundwork to surpass the maximum efficiencies reported to date,” researcher Pablo Sanmartín told pv magazine. 
The research group identified potential targets for High-Power Optical Wireless Transfer (HPOT), including remote mobile electronic devices such as small aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, robots, satellites, and applications in underwater wireless power transfer to improve the operational capabilities of autonomous underwater vehicles. However, they noted that the current system efficiency is limited to around 20%.
To date, OPCs based on gallium arsenide (GaAs) are the most utilized in HPOT research since they are considered well-established and mature. However, that material suffers from relatively higher series resistance losses. Therefore, the researchers offer III-V InGaN and InAlN wide-bandgap semiconductors as prospective OPC materials, as they can match the water's optimal wavelength range.
Their modeling considered three types of recombination mechanisms and was validated by comparing the results for GaAs with empirical results from the scientific literature.
“The concordance between the obtained results is noteworthy, exhibiting relative errors that remain below 1.6% for all parameters and input power densities,” the researchers said.
The group conducted a series of tests and found that the maximum efficiencies were 67.3% at 70 Wcm-2 for GaAs, 70.6% at 75 Wcm-2 for InGaN, and 70.3% at 150 Wcm-2 for InAlN. In the atmosphere, InGaN showed the highest efficiencies within the 10 km, ranging from 70.5 to 65.3%, while InAlN displayed results from 70.3 to 65.1%. In compression, GaAs results were lower at 67.3% to 62.4%.
The nitrides also displayed better results when the medium was water. InGaN achieved a 9.8% global efficiency at 100 meters, while InAlN did 8.6%. In contrast, GaAs presented much more inferior results, with the efficiency dropping to 2.4% at only 1 meter.
“This semiconductor is practically unusable for underwater applications,” the academics said. “It is worth noting that at a distance of 20 m, nitride-based OPCs still reach a global efficiency of over 46%.
The research group said that the nitrides could potentially produce roughly ten times more energy in the same amount of time. They exhibit high efficiencies of more than 63% at extreme light intensities of 1,000 Wcm-2. For comparison, GaAs's highest achievable efficiency is around the same as 67.3% at 100 Wcm-2.
“This enhancement is mainly attributed to the reduction of series resistance losses at intense illuminations, from 28% to around 14%, due to the decrease of current density caused by the use of higher energy gap materials,” they explained.
They described their findings in “Wide-bandgap III-V materials for high-efficiency air and underwater optical photovoltaic power transmission,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
“It is worth noting that the potential fabrication of the devices is constrained to the technological manufacturing restrictions that may arise during the process, as growing the semiconductors with sufficient quality, reaching the desired doping levels or avoid lattice mismatches between the layers,” the researchers said. “The viability of the process also depends on whether the preferred wavelengths or similar are available. In addition, the monochromatic light source should be able to provide such intense power densities and guarantee an operable angular dispersion of the beam within the distances considered.”
