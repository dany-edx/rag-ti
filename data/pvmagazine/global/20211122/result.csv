Austrian PV module manufacturer Energetica filed for insolvency with the regional court of Klagenfurt at the end of October.
“Energetica Industries GmbH can no longer meet its current payment obligations,” the company said in a statement. The amount of the liabilities is indicated at €24.8 million.
The insolvency proceedings will concern 112 employees and around 230 creditors. The aim is to continue the business and to conclude a restructuring plan. Creditors have until December 20 to file their claims.
Local media report that the company's management has proposed a plan to reduce, and ‘optimize,' production costs. Among other things, this provides for the changeover from four to three shifts and the adjustment of the overall costs structure of the company. The previously pursued growth strategy of €50 million in annual sales will also be dispensed with for a short time, local media outlet MeinBezirk.at revealed.
At the end of October, Energetica had informed the employees about the difficult situation at a meeting. It also confirmed that persistent problems with the supply chain for raw materials, and the lack of government coronavirus aid had led to a liquidity bottleneck. Meanwhile, the management started looking for new financiers and spoke of “intensive talks” with potential investors who could be interested in joining the company.
According to local media reports, new capital of €1.5 million was still available from the shareholders in August 2021. Half of the funds were provided in the form of a capital increase and a shareholder loan. In September, however, there was a massive drop in orders and sales collapsed. After the potential investor abandoned the scene at the end of September, the over-indebtedness and insolvency became inevitable, as the portal MeinBezirk.at further reports. Talks with other investors have failed.
Energetica was planning to set up a gigawatt-scale production operation for solar modules at its factory in Liebenfels. The ramp-up phase of the manufacturing facility was significantly affected by the Covid-19 crisis and the targeted production capacity was never achieved.

The result, which has been certified by Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems’ (ISE) CalLab, was also included in the charts of the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory. It improves upon the previous world record achieved by perovskite developer Oxford PV in December 2020, when the U.K.-based company announced a power conversion efficiency of 29.52% for its perovskite/silicon tandem device.
The solar cell has an area of 1cm2 and is based on a nanotextured front side and a back side with a dielectric reflector, which is used to reflect infrared light back into the silicon absorber.
The nanotexturing on one side, according to the researchers, is not only responsible for improving light absorption and photocurrent, compared to a reference solar cell without the nanotextures, but it also, surprisingly, improved, slightly, the electronic quality of the tandem device and enabled better film formation of the perovskite layers.
“By using a dielectric reflector, we were able to use this part of the sunlight more efficiently, resulting in a higher photocurrent,” said HZB researcher Alexandros Cruz Bournazou, noting that the efficiency of the solar cell may soon exceed the 30% threshold, through nanostructuring the absorber layers on both sides.
All the technical details on the solar cell can be found in the paper Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell with >29% efficiency by enhanced hole extraction, which was published in Energy in December 2020, when the same research team achieved an efficiency of 29.15%.

The facility was deployed with 25,000 solar modules on a former cooling pond owned by the steel manufacturer's unit ArcelorMittal Differdange, which operates an electric steel plant in the homonymous municipality in Luxembourg.
The project was tendered by the Luxembourg government in 2019 and is owned and operated by Enovos, while ArcelorMittal has provided  5.7 hectares of its water surface for the project. The solar plant is selling power to the grid at an unspecified price.
Construction on the facility started in March 2021. The floating solar structure and the transformer station were first installed, and then the electrical connection was made,” ArcelorMittal said in a statement. “The highlight of this phase of the project was the drilling under the rail network adjacent to the basin, which allowed the cables needed to connect the installation to the public network, to be laid.”
The steel company said the project is a first for its sites, without providing further details.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Luxembourg had an installed PV capacity of 195 MW at the end of 2020. The country is currently supporting solar through a feed-in tariff scheme.

Aceleron says its “compression technology method” has enabled it to produce products in which every component can be accessed for repair, replacement or upgrade. The company claims its ‘Essential' product is fully recycable, effectively giving the device an “infinite lifespan,” according to co-founder and chief technical officer Carlton Cummins.
Circular manufacturing has been the subject of one of the UP Initiative‘s quarterly themes. We considered whether adopting circular approaches could create a competitive edge and reap financial, as well as reputational rewards, and investigated what is already being done in the solar industry. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
Cummins said the Essential is the same size as a group-31 device – 330 by 173 by 240mm – and weighs around half as much as a traditional battery, with the company website listing a 15kg figure for the 12 V/100 Amp-hour (Ah); 24 V/50 Ah; and 48 V/25 Ah products listed on its website.
The developer states the Essential offers “up to” four times the cycle life and three times more continuous power than equivalent lead-acid devices.
The company says the modular design of the Essential means it can be used in series to power applications ranging from onboard motor home systems up to providing an uninterrupted power supply for data centers.
“As technology evolves, we have the ability to upgrade individual components without the need to discard the entire battery, staying true to our company ethos of promoting reuse and re-manufacture over waste, contributing to the increasingly crucial circular economy,” added Cummins.
That circular manufacturing approach has also been used in the Bromsgrove-based business' new residential product, the Offgen, which Aceleron claims can offer storage capacity ranging from 4-11 kWh, thanks to its modular design.
The fact each battery pack in the residential system can be upgraded adds value to the investment, according to the developer, which said its home storage product can be installed in one electrical-grade cabinet which contains the device or devices, a hybrid inverter, a communications interface, and the switchgear.
The company founder with a flair for an eye-catching quote said of the residential system: “A house lasts for many decades and we believe your battery system should too.”
This copy was amended on 22/11/21 to reflect the fact Aceleron, formerly based in Birmingham, has moved its headquarters to Bromsgrove.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/22/new-efforts-to-bring-silicon-carbide-inverters-closer-to-commercial-maturity/,"INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 22, 2021",New efforts to bring silicon-carbide inverters closer to commercial maturity,"Silicon carbide-based inverters are known for providing higher power density than traditional inverters while having less need for cooling and lower overall system costs. Their commercial maturity, however, is still far from being achieved as defects at the interface between the silicon carbide and the insulating silicon dioxide material still represent a big hurdle to transfer the technology to mass production. To date, only a few inverter makers have manufactured silicon carbide products for the PV industry and, in most cases, the devices are built as prototypes or in pilot projects.
Over recent weeks, two U.S. companies have announced new, interesting developments for their respective silicon carbide inverter technologies – U.S. multinational automotive supplier BorgWarner and U.S. semiconductor company Qorvo.
BorgWarner announced it was awarded $4.97 million by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Award to further develop its Scalable Ultra Power-dense Extended Range (SUPER) inverter for electric vehicles. “With an intense focus on electrification, and as a leading systems integrator and high-voltage inverter supplier, we are proud to be selected by the DOE to develop a next-generation inverter that will accelerate innovation in electric drive systems and propel the performance and capabilities of electric vehicles,” said the company's president, Stefan Demmerle.
The capacity of the company's 800 V Viper silicon carbide based inverter is expected to be scaled up from 100 to 300 kW during the 39-month project, which also sees the participation of semiconductor supplier Infineon Technologies Americas Corp, high-energy-density capacitors manufacturer PolyCharge America Inc, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and public, ‘land-grant' research university Virginia Tech.
“During the first year of the project, which will begin in October, the group will create the concept for the entire silicon carbide (SiC)-based inverter system,” BorgWarner explained. “In the second year, the team will make all critical components that make up the inverter, including the power module and capacitor, and finalize the inverter’s design.” In the project's final stage, all inverter components will be validated and commercial production will be implemented.
In a separate development, Qorvo announced it has acquired New Jersey-based silicon carbide semiconductor provider United Silicon Carbide (UnitedSiC) for an undisclosed sum.
“United Silicon Carbide's product portfolio now spans more than 80 SiC field-effect transistors (FETs), junction-gate field-effect transistors  (JFETs) and Schottky diode devices,” Qorvo said in a statement. “Based on a unique cascode configuration, the recently announced Generation 4 SiC FETs are specified at an industry-leading 750V at 5.9 milliohm RDS(on), enabling new levels of SiC efficiency and performance critical for EV chargers, DC-DC converters and traction drives, as well as telecom/server power supplies, variable speed motor drives and solar photovoltaic (PV) inverters.”
Qorvo's president, Philip Chesley, said the acquisition of United Silicon Carbide will expand the company's market opportunities for power solutions covering power conversion, motion control and circuit protection applications.

This result compares to 3,283.6 MW in the same period a year earlier. “The decline in solar PV installations in Korea can be attributed to delayed permitting, over local governments heightening and expanding siting restrictions,” Eunbyeol Jo, a researcher at Seoul-based NGO Solutions for Our Climate, told pv magazine. “In addition, renewable energy certificate (REC) prices have been dropping due to oversupply in the market over the past three years, hampering solar development.”
In the third quarter of this year, around 677 MW of new PV systems were connected to the Korean grid while in the same period of 2020, the newly installed PV capacity was 1,153 MW. New PV additions for the first quarter totaled 1,017 MW, and in the second quarter equaled 1,134 MW.
At the end of September, the country's cumulative installed PV capacity reached around 17.3 GW.
If the current growth trend is confirmed for the rest of the year, South Korea may not exceed last year's newly installed PV capacity of 4,126 MW, a result that was not only comparatively higher than the 3.8 GW in 2019, and 2.4 GW in 2018, but also made 2020 the most successful year ever recorded by the country.
South Korea currently plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030. According to a recent study by Solutions for Our Climate and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology, in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, the target of having renewables make up 20% of total generation by 2030 must be raised to 40%, and installed renewables capacity needs to increase sevenfold by that year.

LionVolt said it will use the funds to develop its 3D solid-state thin-film battery technology, which it expects to apply initially in wearables and electric cars.
The battery is made with a foil covered with billions of pillars with thin layers of functional material that create a 3D structure with a very large surface area and very short distances between both battery electrodes. Through this architecture, the device's lithium-ions have only a short distance to go through, and this, according to the manufacturer, reduces charging and discharging times.
LionVolt claims this approach enables the product to overcome two major hurdles to bring this technology to commercial production, which are the conformal coating of the full battery stack and the development of scalable manufacturing tools. The creation of the micropillar arrays is reportedly able to reduce the technological challenge of conformal coating, and the open and regular structure facilitates the deposition of consecutive layers.
The battery is claimed to offer higher energy density, a longer lifespan, and increased safety compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries.
The battery configuration is also said to be fully retrofittable into existing commercial formats and a production line can be set up in a very short time, according to the manufacturer, which said it wants to produce the new batteries in the Netherlands. “The BOM invests in LionVolt because the company has enormous potential,” said Jurgen van Eck, from the BOM. “Almost 80% of the supply chain the company needs to build a production line can be sourced locally.”

Kallis Energy Investments, led by South Australian-based Terry Kallis, is proposing to develop an enormous 6 GW project in the state’s north. The Moolawatana Renewable Hydrogen Project, as it’s called, could potentially see a combined solar and wind farm, each with up to 3 GW of capacity, being used to power electrolysers producing renewable, green hydrogen.
Kallis told pv magazine Australia the project will likely not be grid connected, and therefore able to avoid the congestion and grid connection issues that have plagued numerous large-scale projects in the region.
Kallis expects the project will require around 100,000 hectares or 1,000 square kilometres to construct. It is being planned for a location just east of the northern Flinders Ranges, chosen for its premium wind and solar resources. The renewable hydrogen produced there would then be transported to Port Bonython in the south via a dedicated hydrogen pipeline and exported, with the company flagging a particular focus on the Japanese and Korean markets.
Following the completion of a preliminary environmental and planning fatal flaw assessment, Kallis Energy said the project is now at the pre-feasibility stage with the company concurrently doing preliminary consultations. Kallis Energy is also planning to include a desalination plant at the site, flagging that during these early stages it will consider issues like water availability.
Developer Kallis Energy Investments described itself as “a special purpose vehicle” used to develop the Moolawatana Renewable Hydrogen Project and is wholly owned by the Kallis Family Trust. Terry Kallis, the company’s chairman and founder, is also behind South Australia’s Starfish Hill Wind Farm, the offshore 2 GW Star of the South wind farm, and is the co-founder of the Murchison Renewable Hydrogen project in Western Australia’s mid-west which could scale up to 5 GW.
Of his latest endeavour, the Moolawatana Renewable Hydrogen Project, Kallis said it has the potential to contribute significantly to South Australia and indeed Australia’s hydrogen ambitions. “If the project is built to its maximum of 6000 MW, it would contribute about 40% of the state’s goal for 500% renewables by 2050,” he said.
“The development of a global hydrogen industry in Australia has the strong support of both sides of politics in SA and indeed across Australia creating a good environment for investment.”

Solar installations may cover more than 3 million acres of the United States over the next decade, opening the door for PV to be paired with agricultural land to produce food, conserve ecosystems, and maximize income for farmers.
This opportunity led the National Center for Appropriate Technology to launch what it said is the nation’s first AgriSolar Clearinghouse to connect farmers, ranchers, land managers, solar developers, and researchers with information about co-locating solar and agriculture.
The clearinghouse features a library of peer-reviewed information, videos, podcasts, news, and a forum for agrivoltaics discussion. More than 30 partners and stakeholders in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, national energy laboratories, the Smithsonian, and leading universities participated in its creation.
(Read: “Researchers develop a novel design for agrivoltaics”)
Research by Oregon State University found that solar and agricultural co-location could provide 20% of the total electricity generation in the United States. Wide-scale installation of agrivoltaics could lead to an annual reduction of 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions while “minimally” impacting crop yield, the researchers said. The paper found that an area about the size of Maryland would be needed if agrivoltaics were to meet 20% of U.S. electricity generation. That’s about 13,000 square miles, or 1% of current U.S. farmland.
Arizona State University also conducted a study and found “probable barriers to wider adoption” that ranged from mechanized farming and harvesting to the additional costs of elevating PV arrays to allow for food production.
The clearinghouse project was funded by a three-year, $2 million cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office.
