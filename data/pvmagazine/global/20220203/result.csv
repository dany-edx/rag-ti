India's Union Budget shows the government’s determination to promote domestic solar manufacturing, as it includes increased incentives and supportive policies, while discouraging imports by introducing customs duties on PV modules and solar cells from April.
The budget allocates an additional INR 19,500 crore ($2.6 billion) to the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, which offers funding support to bidders who commit to setting up fabs to produce everything from polysilicon to PV modules on Indian soil.
“The move is aimed to facilitate domestic manufacturing for the nation’s ambitious goal of 280GW of installed solar capacity by 2030,” said Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
Tax deadline extension
The minister said newly incorporated manufacturers will have an extra year to be eligible for a 15% concessional tax rate before the start of production, with the deadline extended to the end of March 2024.
Solar manufacturers will benefit from the removal of anti-dumping and countervailing duties applied to foreign-made stainless steel, coated steel products, bars of alloy steel, and high-speed steel, with the government citing the high price of the metals on the international market.
Developers who used imported solar cells and modules will have to brace themselves for the imposition of a 40% basic customs duty on non-Indian solar modules, and a 25% rate on cells from April 1, in response to demands from Indian solar manufacturers.
Sitharaman also announced the launch of sovereign green bonds. The government will support the development of domestic capacity in green energy generation and clean mobility via “supportive policies, light-touch regulations, and facilitative actions,” said the minister. Government contributions will be made to these “sunrise opportunities,” said Sitharaman, without offering specifics.
To help foster e-mobility, the minister said energy storage projects would enjoy the benefits of being designated as infrastructure assets – including access to cheap finance. The government will also establish special mobility zones with zero fossil-fuel and battery swapping policies.
“Considering the constraint of space in urban areas for setting up charging stations at scale, a battery swapping policy will be brought out and interoperability standards will be formulated,” said Sitharaman. “The private sector will be encouraged to develop sustainable and innovative business models for “battery or energy as a service.” This will improve efficiency in the EV [electric vehicle] ecosystem.”
Range of reactions
Sumant Sinha, the chairman and chief executive of Nasdaq-listed Indian renewables developer ReNew Power, hailed the budget as climate-friendly.
“The budget lays the groundwork for India’s ambition to become a net-zero country by 2070,” he said. “The government has very firmly put [the] energy transition and clean energy at the heart of India’s economic growth and looks to address some of the most challenging aspects of this transition.”
The PLI tender to support the gigawatt-scale production of high-efficiency solar modules received bids for 54.5GW of solar equipment annual manufacturing capacity last year, with several bidders put on the waiting list. Today’s additional budget allocation will ensure more manufacturers are supported by the scheme.
Sinha said the revocation of anti-dumping duty on steel will reduce the cost of modules considerably and tie in well with incentives for locally incorporated manufacturing entities, which will be able to start manufacturing by March 31, 2024. The definition of grid storage as infrastructure assets will help mobility startups and independent power providers explore low-cost financing, he added.
The clean power executive also welcomed the budget announcement on sovereign green bonds, saying they will help mobilize finance for electricity distribution companies as well as for clean energy investors.
Vineet Mittal, chairman of fellow renewables developer Avaada Group, said the Union Budget will make it easier to invest in Indian clean power.
“The industry was eagerly waiting for these reforms to increase its competitiveness and take the growth of the sector to the next level and become self-reliant in renewable energy. The government has shown its commitment to become self-reliant in module manufacturing and battery storage,” he said.
Gyanesh Chaudhary, the vice chairman and managing director of module manufacturer Vikram Solar, welcomed the additional PLI allocation.
“The sovereign green bonds will boost green infrastructure development which will help in meeting India’s carbon emission reduction targets,” he added. “Green bonds will also enable an international yield curve for Indian corporates, leading to better pricing for bonds. The battery-swapping policy, with interoperability standards, will boost the electric vehicle ecosystem.”
Chaudhary told pv magazine that he appreciated the government’s focus on strengthening the domestic solar industry by notifying the basic customs duties on solar products.
“We are confident, with the implementation and roll-out of the measures announced in Budget 2022, we will move closer towards realizing the aatmanirbhar Bharat vision in the solar sector, and India’s energy security through green power,” he said.
Reasons to cheer
Bharat Bhut, co-founder and director of Gujarati PV manufacturer Goldi Solar said the budget has given indigenous manufacturers several “reasons to cheer.” He said that implementing a 40% basic customs duty on solar modules “will ensure the growth of the entire domestic manufacturing ecosystem.”
However, he said the application criteria applied to the PLI program should be changed so all sizes of business can participate.
“All of these measures will result in a more robust domestic module supply,” he concluded.

Brisbane-based eleXsys Energy will seek to demonstrate the potential of its new technology which has been designed to increase distributed energy resources (DER) hosting capacity on low-voltage power lines after securing AUD451,000 ($321.141) in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).
EleXsys said the device works by regulating voltage on low-voltage power lines by dynamically providing or absorbing reactive power. By maintaining voltage within normal operating bands, eleXsys can better utilise DER, such as locally produced solar and battery storage, effectively preventing curtailment of exports and without expensive grid upgrades.
EleXsys chief executive Bevan Holcombe said the trial will demonstrate “the applications of eleXsys in the residential DER market and how existing distribution grids can be supported to host much more exported solar energy than is typically the case in Australia today”.
“We believe that distributed energy is the most efficient form of energy generation that you can have,” he said. The $1.92 million trial project will be undertaken in conjunction with distribution network service provider (DNSP) Energy Queensland.
EleXsys will install five of the devices, with three to be directly connected to Energy Queensland’s network. One will be trialled behind the meter on a customer’s premises, and one will be tested at Energy Queensland’s Real Time Digital Simulator facility in Cairns to show how the device performs across a wider range of network types.
The project will also benefit from the insights of several other DNSPs participating in a dedicated stakeholder reference group.
The final findings of the project are to be made public with a knowledge sharing report to be published.
ARENA chief executive Darren Miller said technology like the eleXsys device will play an increasingly important role in the addition of more renewables to Australia’s energy makeup.
“To help increase the amount of distributed energy we can have on Australia’s energy network, it’s vital that ARENA supports these new technologies such as the eleXsys which not only help to connect more home solar and batteries, but also helps to avoid expensive network augmentation works to support increased demand,” he said.
“After a successful trial in southeast Queensland, we could see the technology installed across the grid to save costs for users while also enabling more distributed renewals to be connected to the grid.”
The funding for the trial comes after ARENA last year awarded eleXsys $3.5 million under the Modern Manufacturing Initiative, enabling the construction of a purpose-built manufacturing facility.
Assistant Energy Minister Tim Wilson said on Thursday that ARENA’s latest investment will allow clean energy producers to feed much more energy back into existing electricity distribution grids.
“With one in four households powering the nation through rooftop solar, and another 2,000 added every business day, we’re investing $450,000 to boost their contribution to the grid, so they play a bigger role in our carbon neutral future,” he said.
“The devices will be trialled on the Energy Queensland network for now, but the technology could be applicable to any low-voltage area in Australia.”

The company said the 40/40 warranty is the longest and most comprehensive combined warranty offered in the photovoltaic industry to date. The product line is sold in most countries outside the United States and Canada under the SunPower Maxeon brand.
“The new SunPower Maxeon 40 Year Warranty is based on external field studies from more than 33 million IBC panels deployed worldwide, comprehensive accelerated life testing by Maxeon and third parties, and a physics-based model which Maxeon uses to determine the expected performance impact over time from major degradation and failure modes,” the manufacturer stated. “Collectively, these give Maxeon and our customers confidence that the SunPower Maxeon module technology can support a 40-year warranted life, and that continued operation beyond this period is certainly feasible.”
According to the company, its IBC modules come with a minimum warranted output of 98% during their first year of operation, followed by a maximum annual degradation of 0.25% for the next 39 years. “The result is an unprecedented 88.3% warranted power level at the end of 40 years, meaning Maxeon IBC panels deliver up to 9.5% more power after 40 years than standard solar panels deliver after 25 years,” it also said.

“The solar array will be coupled directly with the vanadium flow battery, improving plant efficiency, operating flexibility and costs,” Invinity said in a statement. “Compared with more common lithium-ion batteries, Invinity’s VFBs are a safer form of longer-duration, utility-grade energy storage, offering excellent operational longevity in ultra-heavy duty use while being fully recyclable at end of life.”
The project is being backed by the Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA), which is a Canadian non profit organization that invests in environmental and cleantech companies.
“Alberta has a long history of leadership in energy; the fact that this shovel-ready project will expand that leadership in new directions while creating great new jobs is a testament to how Alberta caacln innovate and build,” said Invinity CCO Matt Harper. “Clean energy on demand is becoming an increasingly valuable commodity; in delivering solar and storage together at Chappice Lake, we will prove that solar generation plus Invinity’s utility-grade vanadium flow batteries can make Alberta a powerhouse for the North American grid.”
Vanadium flow batteries offer heavy-duty energy storage and are designed for use in high-utilization applications, such as industrial-scale solar PV generation for distributed, low-emissions energy projects. Energy is stored in a non-flammable, liquid electrolyte and the batteries do not degrade with cycling like lithium-ion options and they can be scaled and located with greater flexibility than pumped hydro energy storage.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/03/eu-commission-holds-firm-on-taxonomy-nuclear-power-gas-to-be-seen-as-sustainable/,"MARKETS,EUROPE",PV MAGAZINE,"FEBRUARY 3, 2022","EU Commission holds firm on taxonomy – nuclear power, gas to be seen as sustainable","From pv magazine Germany
The European Commission has not backpedaled: In the future, nuclear energy and gas-fired power plants will be considered sustainable within the framework of the EU taxonomy, in opposition to the assessment of its own group of experts.
The panel consists of climate experts from science, business and non-governmental organizations. In principle, the experts described nuclear power as unsustainable. However, according to unconfirmed media reports, the commission appears ready to modify the specifications for gas-fired power plants compared to their original draft – mainly at the request of Germany.
New gas-fired power plants will be considered sustainable by 2030 if they replace power plants with higher CO2 emissions and switch completely to more climate-friendly fuels such as hydrogen by 2035 at the latest. In the original draft, the commission had specified 2026 as the latest date for the admixture of such gases. The upper limit is 270 grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced, or the power plant may not exceed the value of 550 kg/kW of installed capacity over the course of 20 years.
According to an EU spokesman, the EU Parliament and member states now have four to six months to reject the commission's plans, which is considered unlikely, as in parliament, 353 of the 705 members would have to vote against it. MEPs from the Greens and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) have already announced resistance, but it will be difficult without votes from the large conservative camp of the European People's Party (EPP) group. The latter has already welcomed the commission's plans.
However, there are also critics within their ranks, such as Member of Parliament Markus Ferber from CSU, the German conservative party. “The European Commission has ignored all the critical feedback it received on the first draft of the delegated act,” he said.
Only a qualified majority in the European Council could stop the plan. That would be at least 20 states that together represent at least 65% of the population in the union.
Europe divided
Austria and Luxembourg have already announced that they will take legal action. “Nuclear power is neither ‘green' nor sustainable. I cannot understand the EU's decision,” Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said on Twitter.
Environmental organizations have been asking the German federal government for weeks to also sue. However, the new ruling coalition is internally divided and has thus far rejected these demands. German Greens leader Ricarda Lang advocates a “no” from the federal government and calls for the chances of success for a lawsuit against the legal act to be examined. If these are positive, Germany should join the lawsuits of other EU member states.
The Free Democratic Party (FDP), also a coalition partner, sees it differently. Its spokesman for energy policy, Michael Kruse, has spoken about striking a fair compromise. But his party colleague, Finance State Secretary Florian Toncar, was more discreet in recent comments to Reuters. “I expect that the market will develop financial products that are in line with the taxonomy, but deliberately avoid financing nuclear energy,” said the FDP politician, describing an eco-label for nuclear power as unjustified.
In the course of the legislative process, it could also be clarified whether the EU Commission is entitled to make such a decision almost unilaterally by means of a delegated legal act. Several experts on EU law have questioned this in recent weeks and have determined that a proper legislative procedure involving parliament would be necessary. Earlier this week, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden rejected the sustainable classification of gas in a letter to the commission.
Investors unhappy
Critics from the Platform for Sustainable Finance to numerous environmental organizations have complained that there is no reason to describe a bridging technology as sustainable. They reject nuclear energy, anyway.
Criticism also comes from the financial sector, especially from the ranks of sustainability funds. The word “greenwashing” is used frequently.
The taxonomy of the financial sector is actually designed to specify which investments can be described as sustainable. Based on this, an EU eco-label for funds is expected to be introduced in the coming years. Hans Stegmann, chief strategist at Triodos Management, finds clear words for the EU Commission's decision on nuclear power and gas: “This is how we bury the taxonomy.”

The government said it had originally earmarked €5 million for the program and that the budget increase was necessary to meet the strong demand registered since the scheme was launched. Around 12,000 applications totaling 30 MW have already been submitted.
The application deadline is February 11 and the government expects the funds will be fully utilized. “The booming in applications shows that the citizens have a good understanding of the investment returns in green energy,” said energy minister Dainius Kreivys. “The additional funds will not only reduce the energy bills of the population, but will also help to achieve a breakthrough by increasing the energy independence of households.”
The government expects to allocate a total of €300 million for solar rebates until 2029. Residential PV system owners in Lithuania are entitled to sell excess power to the grid under net metering.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Baltic nation had 148 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2020. It is heavily dependent on energy imports. A plan for energy independence by 2050 foresees the large scale deployment of renewable energy resources.

In the paper “Next steps in the footprint project: A feasibility study of installing solar panels on Bath Abbey,” published in Energy Science & Engineering, the scientists explained that while solar projects on historical buildings may require a high upfront investment, their profitability may be ensured by proper project design.
They used the commercial software package PVsyst to model, based on local solar irradiation and ambient temperature data, a 164-panel PV system to be deployed on the unshaded regions of the Abbey roof. The novelty of their approach consisted of considering shading effects in detail.
The 59.9 kW model solar array employed 21.1% efficient LG 365 Q1C-A5 solar modules with an output of 365 W from Korean manufacturer LG, and inverters from Chinese producer Huawei and US manufacturer SunPower. “Optimizers are included to minimize the impact of the shading on the PV system performance by ensuring that if any individual solar panel is shaded, the maximum current can still flow through that one panel,” the academics emphasized. “Other equipment choices could be considered to optimize further the cost and efficiency of the devices to maximize profits.”
Possible shading was analyzed considering beam, diffuse and albedo components. The analysis also took into account linear shading losses representing the irradiation deficit and electrical shading losses resulting from the electrical mismatches between shaded and non-shaded interconnected PV modules.
The PV system was assumed to operate under UK's net metering regime and its efficiency degradation was estimated at 0.4% per year. Installation costs were assumed to be £1,139 ($1,544) per installed kilowatt, which correspond to standard costs for the UK market in 2019. “The costs include the cost of safety and access equipment such as a crane with edge protection for the building,” the academics explained.
The model was stress tested for different changes to the price of electricity and the researchers found that, even with a 3% drop in electricity prices, the project would still be profitable. “We have assumed that all the electricity generated would be used except on days with excess generation compared with demand,” they stated. “This assumption is backed by information from staff at the Abbey that most of the demand is between 8 AM and 6 PM.” Their cost-benefit analysis showed that the solar array could pay for itself in 13 years and provide a profit of £139,000 over a lifespan of 25 years.
The research built on the success of a rooftop project installed on the Gloucester Cathedral in the UK in 2016. That array represented the first attempt to deploy solar on historical buildings.

“Perovskitoids have the potential to effectively modify 3D perovskite due to its diverse PbI6 connection styles and high stability,” they stated, referring to the properties of the 1D and 0D capping layer materials used for 3D perovskite (m-PBA)2PbI6. “Both 1D and 0D perovskitoids have intrinsically low defect densities and can withstand relatively high lattice strains; thus, they can serve as blocking channels for undesired Shockley-Read-Hall recombination and material degradation.”
The film composition was analyzed through grazing-incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements and the LD perovskitoids were found able to restrain the formation of the photoinactive nonperovskite phase.
The growth of the perovskitoids on the 3D perovskite, according to the scientists, enables effective and all-around passivation of the perovskite surfaces and grain boundaries. The thickness of the perovskite film is around 650 nm, which they claim can ensure sufficient absorption of light. The LD perovskitoid structure was coated at the surface of the 3D perovskite with an overall thickness of approximately 5 nm.
The solar cell was built with an indium tin oxide substrate, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on Tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), the perovskite layer, a spiro-OMeTAD hole-blocking layer, and a gold (Au) metal contact. The champion device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.18%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.151 V, a short-circuit current of 25.96 mA/cm2, and fill factor of 80.91%. 
The cell was also found to maintain 90% of its initial efficiency after being stored in ambient air for 2,000 hours and after 800 hours of continuous illumination under maximum power point operating conditions. “The significant improvement of stability in 3D/LD PSC is attributed to better moisture resistance of LD capping layers, reduced trap density of 3D perovskite surface, and tight bonding of the 3D/LD interface,” the Chinese group stated. “This study establishes a new material engineering scheme for perovskite solar cells with enormous numbers of 1D and 0D perovskitoid candidates that can be used to further improve the PSC performance and stability.”
The solar cell is described in the paper “Highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells enabled by low-dimensional perovskitoids,” which was recently published in Science Advances.

Australia's Zenith Energy has revealed that it will install additional solar PV and battery storage capacity at IGO’s Nova nickel-copper-cobalt operation in West Australia’s Goldfield region, allowing the mine to be powered continuously by on-site renewables for up to nine hours at a time.
The Nova site is currently powered by a 26 MW hybrid solar PV-diesel plant, including a 6.7MW solar array. The addition of another 10MW of solar capacity and the installation of a 10MWh battery energy storage system is expected to allow for 100% renewable power generation during daylight hours, weather permitting.
Zenith Energy, which owns and operates the existing hybrid power plant, said the deployment of additional solar generation and energy storage will be key to achieving “engine off,” storing sufficient power to ensure supply and reliability of the system is not compromised. Its executive manager of growth, Dominic Da Cruz, said that the project will require the integration of “specific technology into the power system to provide inertia and stability, ensuring a continuous, reliable supply of power.”
“While there are currently non-industrial microgrids operating on 100% renewables, the Nova project will prove it’s possible to use 100% renewables to meet the demands of an operational mine site,” he said. “It will also prove the ability for sites to go ‘engine off’ for consecutive hours, without interruption to supply.”
Da Cruz said the Nova project will also demonstrate that 100% renewable energy penetration can be sustainably achieved and replicated on other sites across Australia now, without having to wait for further advancements in technology.
“This project sends a strong message to the industry that powering an entire site completely on renewables is possible today,” he said. “For sites where renewables are already part of the power generation system, where land permits, increasing renewable assets to go ‘engine off’ is a natural next step on the pathway to net zero.”
Fellow Western Australian energy company Hybrid Systems Australia (HSA) has already demonstrated that powering an industrial site with 100% renewables during daylight hours is achievable.
In late 2020, HSA installed a 1.2MW solar farm, a 2MW diesel power station and a 350kWh lithium-ion battery at Tellus’ Sandy Ridge mine and waste facility near Kalgoorlie. The system was switched on in December 2020 and the facility is being 100% powered by renewable energy during daytime operations, thanks to a 15-year power purchase agreement.
Da Cruz said while Nova will continue to rely on diesel-generated power overnight and during inclement weather conditions, he is confident the industry is approaching a tipping point where 100% renewable power generation will be possible 24 hours a day.
“Zenith is already looking at what subsequent steps are needed to achieve this ultimate goal, including how we facilitate higher levels of renewable penetration, and integration of long-duration storage,” he said. “It’s an exciting time not just for Zenith as a company, but for the entire industry. We’re making real progress in the decarbonization space and what that might look like for the sector moving forward.”
IGO Chief Operating Officer Matt Dusci said the project is an important next step in the miner’s journey towards carbon neutrality and sets a new “benchmark” for the resources industry.
“We are now at a point where technology and cost structure are enabling powering of an entire mining operation with 100% renewable penetration,” he said. “By supporting greater uses of renewable energy at our Nova operation, it will set a new industry benchmark in renewable energy integration and demonstrates our commitment to decarbonise our business.”
The existing Nova solar farm has been operational since 2019 and last year provided more than 11% of the mining operation’s total power consumption, displacing about 2,444 kiloliters of diesel and eliminating 6,600 tons of carbon.
Zenith Energy, which signed its original PPA with IGO in October 2018, said that the expansion project will also highlight the benefits of relocatable renewables with redeployable modular solar technology provided by Sydney-based manufacturer 5B expected to be used.
Once Zenith Energy’s tenure at Nova ends, the solar panels and battery energy storage system are set to be relocated to another site in what will be “the first practical demonstration at scale of relocatable renewable energy.”
“Proving this will assist in reducing barriers to capital expenditure, as renewable assets are used in multiple locations over their life span,” Zenith Energy said in a statement. “It will also fast-track deployment of solar and further emission reductions across Zenith’s legacy portfolio.”
The announcement comes after IGO signed an agreement with Perth-based energy storage company VSUN Energy to trial a hybrid standalone power system (SPS) backed by a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) at the Nova site. VSUN Energy, a subsidiary of Australian Vanadium Ltd. (AVL), will also install a SPS based on a 300kWh VRFB supplied by Spanish battery manufacturer E22. AVL said the new SPS, which will be used to power a bore pump on-site, has been designed to provide a 100% renewable energy supply for much of the year, although the initial 12-month trial will target a total renewable penetration of 85% to 90%.

“Smoke was detected by VESDA (smoke-detection apparatus) units in the vicinity of cores 64, 57, 47 and 41, causing water to be released to preaction zone 24 and stopping the flow of electrical current through the affected cores (an automated process referred to as E-Stop). Due to an apparent programming error in the VESDA, these actions occurred at detected smoke levels below the specified design level at which water was intended to be released and E-Stop was intended to be initiated.”
The very early VESDA notification set off a water release action. This action caused a water-based battery heat suppression system to activate. Unfortunately, when the couplings on flexible hoses of this system failed, water sprayed directly onto additional battery racks, causing short circuiting and arcing, which damaged the batteries and made more smoke. The additional smoke set off more alarms and caused even more water to spray from the failed couplings.
Vistra notes that during the construction process, there was some pressure testing that occurred. For instance, the preaction header piping and the piping on each battery rack underwent separate pressure testing. However, Vistra has been unable to confirm that the contractor pressure tested the complete heat suppression system after the racks were connected to the header pipes.
In the end, 7% of the facility’s batteries were damaged by water, along with other infrastructure. Notably, there was no temperature increase noted in any battery modules at any time during the incident.
There are two battery facilities owned by Vistra on the site. The smaller, and newer, 100MW/400 MW facility was not affected. The original, larger, 300MW/1.2 GWh structure was where the incident occurred.
The 300MW facility is broken down into three 100MW arrays, with 98 cores, and 4,539 racks, holding 99,858 modules of batteries. Each battery module, part number M48290P5B (4P) on the LG Energy website, is housed within the new TR-1300 double wide form factor. LG’s JH4 battery cell populates these units. Each module holds 14.9kWh of 72.5Ah JH4 cells, while the just over 5,000 pound TR1300 holds 327kWh of energy.
A video released by LG Energy showcasing the TR 1300 briefly highlights the fire-suppression system (starting at 2:46). The fire-suppression system includes a standard water sprinkler system. A separate water-based heat-suppression system that is specifically designed to protect against thermal runaway in individual battery modules is also deployed. This system has carbon steel header pipes that are connected by flexible hoses to piping on each rack.
