The Dutch company officially unveiled the model in June, billing it as the car with “more range, less battery”.  Covered in solar panels, the Lightyear 0, has a Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) range of 625 kilometers and consumption of 10.5 kWh per 100 kilometers.  However, the Dutch startup claims that a theoretical range of 695 kilometers could be achieved with a battery pack capacity of 60 kWh. “The optimized solar roof and holistic design mean that the car can drive for weeks, even months, without charging,” the company said. Now, Lightyear 0 has made what it is described as “automotive history” in groundbreaking wind tunnel tests. With a drag coefficient of 0.175, it outperformed Tesla Model 3’s 0.23, Mercedes-Benz EQS’ 0.20, as well as the diesel-electric hybrid Volkswagen XL1’s coefficient of 0.186. According to the company, Lightyear 0’s energy consumption, and therefore its efficiency, depends on three key elements: the aerodynamics, rolling resistance and heating system. “In fact, at highway speeds, aerodynamics account for around 60% of overall energy consumption. Most electric car drivers will have felt the sting of restricted range, especially at higher speeds,” Lightyear says in a blog post regarding the record. “A good (low) drag coefficient means a more economical car that consumes less energy and, as a result, can drive further on one charge. Our drag coefficient is a huge contributor to the overall efficiency that places Lightyear 0 as a market frontrunner,” it says.
Our Next Energy (ONE) has unveiled a new anode-free battery cell technology that can deliver up to 600 miles of driving range while reducing cell-level costs to $50 per kilowatt-hour. Last week, the Michigan-based startup unveiled a 240-Ah prismatic anode-free cell after a 12-month R&D effort. With a volumetric energy density of 1007 Wh/L, the anode-free cell is believed to be the highest energy density large-format cell ever produced. “Our prismatic anode-free cell is produced with approximately half of current cell manufacturing equipment for equivalent capacity, allowing us to sharply reduce scale-up cost,” said Mujeeb Ijaz, founder and CEO of ONE. The technology will enable the commercialization of ONE's Gemini dual-chemistry battery pack architecture, which combines lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) and anode-free chemistries into one battery pack, enabled by the company's proprietary DC-DC converter. This allows each specialty chemistry to focus on different functions: LFP for daily driving, and anode-free to extend range for long distances. This combined system is expected to deliver more than 250,000 miles of lifetime service. The company’s goal is to launch the Gemini battery in 2026 with zero cobalt and 26% nickel or less, using manganese as the primary cathode material.
ABB E-Mobility is expanding its manufacturing footprint in the U.S. The company has announced that it will invest several million dollars in a new EV charger facility in Columbia, South Carolina. The new facility will be capable of producing up to 10,000 chargers per year, ranging from 20 kW to 180 kW in power, which are suited for public charging, school buses, and fleets. The new plant will allow the company to “respond more quickly to US market demand, make its supply chain more efficient and local, and shorten delivery times,” ABB says. It is expected to create 100 new jobs. The operation builds on ABB E-mobility’s existing US manufacturing operations, which produce transit bus chargers that range from 150 kW to 450 kW.
Geely has unveiled a 600 kW supercharging technology that it says can add 300 km of EV driving range in just five minutes. Presently, only the 01 EV from Geely’s electric-only brand Zeekr is able to charge at this speed by virtue of CATL’s latest Qilin ultra-long range battery with 1,000 km of range. The new technology has been developed by an affiliate company of Volvo parent Geely called Viridi E-mobility Technology. It is currently only available in China and is ready for mass production.
A team of students from the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands have designed a car that consumes more carbon than it emits while driving. The prototype car, called Zem, can capture 2 kilograms of CO₂ through a special filter at 20,000 travel miles per year. The filter through which the outside air flows is unique and the group of 35 students are in the process of applying for a patent for this innovation. “It is really still a proof-of-concept, but we can already see that we will be able to increase the capacity of the filter in the coming years. Capturing CO₂ is a prerequisite for compensating for emissions during production and recycling,” explains team manager Louise de Laat. The sporty all-electric car is made mostly from 3D-printed recycled plastics. It can currently drive 320 kilometers before the filter is full, and the team is thinking of a future where the full filter can be emptied easily via the charging station when the car is charging.
Shell plans to install over 10,00 EV chargers across India by 2030. Last week, the energy major launched its first EV chargers in India for the four-wheeler and two-wheeler segments in Bengaluru. India is the first market for Shell to launch chargers for two-wheelers. Shell will provide customized charging solutions at on-the-go locations such as its fuel stations, standalone EV hubs, home charging and destination locations. For on-the-go and standalone EV hubs, the company will deploy 100 kW and above DC fast chargers. Customers will be able to operate these chargers through the Shell Recharge India app, available on both Android and iOS operating systems.
Batteryloop will reuse batteries from Mercedes-Benz Energy electric vehicles to deliver stationary storage projects in Sweden. The start-up, part of Swedish recycling company Stena Metall Group, said it had received three orders for its BLESS III storage systems of 2.8 MW each. The first system will be installed in Karlshamn Kommun and will help stabilize the local power grid via peak shaving and frequency regulation services. The second system will be delivered to to Humlestaden, Ikano Bostad and Stena Fastigheters new sustainable district with 3,000 new residences. The storage system there will be used for frequency regulation services. Finally, Batteryloop will install an energy storage system from recycled vehicle batteries at the Stena Nordic Recycling Centre in Halmstad for the purpose of peak shaving and frequency regulation. The Swedish start-up signed a framework agreement with Mercedes-Benz Energy earlier this year giving it access to 40 MWh of used battery storage systems.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/19/solar-pv-employed-around-3-4-million-people-in-2021/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2022",Solar PV employed around 3.4 million people in 2021,"The energy sector employed over 65 million people in 2019, or 2% of global employment, according to the newly published World Energy Employment Report by the IEA. Half of this workforce is employed in the clean energy sector, with solar PV employing more workers than any other power generation technology.
According to the report, power generation employment totaled 11.2 million in 2019, comprised of 3 million in solar PV, 2 million in coal power, and 1.9 million in hydro. Onshore and offshore wind power employed 1.2 million and nuclear power 1 million. Employment in other renewables totaled around 710,000 employees.
The agency estimates that employment in the entire energy sector in 2021 was up by around 1.3 million and could increase by another 6 percentage points by 2022, with clean energy accounting for all of the growth. Energy investment could rise by 8% in 2022, reaching $2.4 trillion, but with almost half of the increase in capital spending linked to higher costs.
Around 3.4 million workers were employed in solar PV in 2021, almost half of which in China, enabled by lower-cost labor, according to the report. North America employed around 280,000 workers and Europe over 260,000. There were around 50,000 people working in the solar industry in Africa, with this number set to grow due to the proliferation of on- and off-grid solutions in the continent, the agency said.
Most employees in the industry work in manufacturing and installation of new capacity, with manufacturing jobs being strongly concentrated in a few countries: China alone accounted for 260,000 workers in the production of polysilicon, wafers, cells, and modules.
“Residential solar panels are often installed by construction workers and electricians who also work on other projects, such that many solar PV jobs are not full-time, and it can be difficult to count employees accurately,” the agency noted.
Shortage of skilled labor poses a major challenge for the industry, which is expected to see continuous growth in annual capacity installation in every IEA scenario. Around $215 billion were invested in the industry in 2021, an annual average growth of 5% over the previous decade, according to the report. Total installed capacity worldwide stood at 740 GW in 2019, comprising 425 GW of utility-scale installations and 315 GW of residential and commercial and industrial (C&I) installations.
Construction of new projects, including manufacturing of components, is reportedly the main driver of employment across the energy sector, employing over 60% of the workforce. Industries with a higher share of workers in construction, like solar, have lower wage premiums than industries like nuclear, oil, and gas, according to the report. The solar industry also has less trade union representation than fossil fuel industries, where labor representation has led to higher wages.
According to the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, 14 million new clean energy jobs will be created by 2030, with another 16 million workers shifting to new roles related to clean energy. In this scenario, around 60% of new employees will require at least two years of post-secondary education, making worker training essential to the sustainable development of the industry.
The report also shows that currently women are strongly under-represented in the energy sector, accounting for 16% of the sector’s workforce, compared to 39% of global employment.
“Women make up a very small share of senior management in energy, just under 14% on average. However, there is substantial variation among energy sectors, with the percentage shares in nuclear and coal the lowest at 8% and 9%, respectively, whereas electric utilities are among the highest with nearly 20%. This compares with 16% of women in senior management economy-wide,” the report says. There are no major differences in the share of women’s employment between fossil fuels and clean energy globally.

In mid-August, the Swiss Federal Council amended the National Roads Ordinance to allow the country to generate renewable energy on free spaces along major national highways. The new regulation will come into effect on October 1 and will allow the construction of PV plants, wind turbines and geothermal plants along the roads.
The Swiss Federal Roads Office (FEDRO) started yesterday the selection process to assign these areas free of charge to solar developers. Interested developers will have time until February 24 to express their interest in these surfaces.
FEDRO decide to assign around 350 noise protection walls and 100 rest areas across 15 lots for the tender.
According to FEDRO, the procedure is similar to the allocation of locations for fast charging stations at rest areas that was held in 2018. The application documents and a visualization of the areas are available on the Federal Office's website.
According to the tender specifications, the third parties, i.e. the tenants of the areas, are responsible for the planning, financing, construction, connection and operation of the photovoltaic systems. They will also have to deal independently with the sale of the electricity and the search for a buyer.
Last year, the Swiss authorities said the potential for electricity production along motorways and railways was 101 GWh per year, including 46 GWh for railways and 55 GWh for national roads. The FEDRO is already partly exploiting this potential of 55 GWh for its own electricity consumption, particularly near tunnels and in maintenance centers.

The cell also achieved an open-circuit voltage of 750.2 mV, a short-circuit current of 11,271 mA, and a fill factor of 84.76%. The result was confirmed by the Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH) in Hamelin, Germany.
Longi achieved an efficiency of 25.47% for the same solar cell in March. The company said the performance enhancement was due to an improvement in the passivation process without providing further details.
The Chinese manufacturer also achieved an efficiency of 26.5% for a n-type heterojunction cell in June and a 25.19% rating for its p-type TOPCon solar cell in July 2021. In June 2021, it recorded a 25.21% efficiency rating for an n-type TOPCon device.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/19/pakistani-regulator-clarifies-net-metering-proposal/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,PAKISTAN",MAX HALL,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2022",Pakistani regulator clarifies net metering proposal,"The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has been forced to calm fears that its plans to amend Pakistan‘s electricity net metering rules might hit solar system owners and the nation's clean energy ambitions.
The government body last week said the possible change to net metering – which permits solar households to sell excess electricity to the grid, thereby reducing their net energy bills – concerned solely a proposal to raise the payments made for solar electricity injected into the grid.
A statement issued by Nepra said: “It is clarified that [the] proposed amendment would not have any impact on self-consumption [of solar electricity], as well as netting off of the units.”
Netting off refers to the fact credit awarded for excess solar power injected to the grid comes off household electricity bills.
The statement continued: “The units would be netted off as per the already approved mechanism. The amendment in the regulations only applies to the excess units sold by net metering consumers.”
Referring to “misreporting” in “the media” and on social media, the regulator added that any rise in payments would apply only to excess electricity generated under the net metering program and would not endanger national solar ambitions. That clarification suggests there had been speculation any rise in payments would apply to the cost of all solar electricity, including that generated at utility scale projects.
Nepra said the proposed rise in net metered electricity payments is only out for public consultation at present, with no decision having been reached.
The regulator confirmed any rise in the cost of applying net metering would be borne by all grid electricity users.
The most recent consultation exercise announced on the Nepra website in relation to the net metering regime opened on August 24, 2022, and is due to close this week. That proposal simply concerned changing the wording of a phrase used in the rules from “national average power purchase price” to “national average energy purchase price.”
An article last week in The News International newspaper, published a day before the Nepra clarification, called for wider access to finance to enable wider adoption of home solar and storage and criticized sluggish take-up of the policy to date.
Nepra itself confirmed only 20,700 households benefited from net metering at the time of its statement.
Application of the program is also hampered by slow roll-out of appropriate electricity meters by utilities, The News International report stated, referring to a webinar on the topic held last week.
At the same event, a utility spokesperson pointed to a lack of training, aging power infrastructure, power company financial woes, and a lack of net metering equipment standards as reasons for the difficulty in installing meters.

Mahindra Group has signed a binding agreement to sell a 30% equity stake in its renewables arm, Mahindra Susten, to Canada’s Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan for around $300 million (INR 2,371 crore, CAD 398.8 million).   
The proposed transaction envisages the establishment of an infrastructure investment trust, InvIT. The InvIT will initially include Mahindra Susten’s operating renewable portfolio of around 1.54 GWp. The National Stock Exchange defines “InvITs as a collective investment scheme similar to a mutual fund, which enables direct investment of money from individual and institutional investors in infrastructure projects to earn a small portion of the income as a return.”
The partnership with the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan will enable the Mahindra Group to unlock value in the renewable energy sector with more joint investments. As part of the proposed transaction, shareholder loans of $73 million advanced by Mahindra Group to Mahindra Susten will be repaid. Mahindra Group will receive an inflow of around $165 million.
Mahindra Group and the Canadian pension fund will jointly explore the sale of an additional 9.99% stake in Mahindra Susten by May 31, 2023. Mahindra Group will deploy these funds, plus an incremental amount of up to $220 million, to the business and the InvIT over the next seven years. Over the same period, the the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan has committed to deploy an additional amount of up to $450 million into the business and the InvIT.
The transaction will enable Mahindra Susten to build a renewable energy business focused on solar energy, hybrid energy, integrated energy storage, and round-the-clock green energy plants, said Mahindra Group.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/19/wafer-scale-microwire-solar-cell-with-21-1-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2022",Wafer scale microwire solar cell with 21.1% efficiency,"Scientists from the Kangwon National University in South Korea have designed a radial junction solar cell based on tapered microwire (TMW) and have increased its size from the lab scale to the wafer scale in order to demonstrate the feasibility of conventional fabrication process.
“We think our microwire solar cells have great potential to compete with commercial cells,” the research project's corresponding author, Handom Um, told pv magazine. “The fabrication technologies we used were the conventional semiconducting processes such as photolithography, reactive ion etch, doping process, and atomic layer deposition.”
Crystalline silicon TMW solar cells are considered a potential alternative to conventional solar cells as these devices require thinner silicon wafers instead of the industry standard 160 µm thick wafers. “This could reduce manufacturing capital expenditure by 48% and module cost by 28%,” the Korean group claims.
The researchers used reactive-ion etching (DRIE) to build a black crystalline silicon TMW array on a 6-inch wafer. This array has a low reflection of incident light and minimized impedance mismatch. “The TMW array considerably enhanced the light absorption over the entire wavelength region from 300 to 1,100 nm,” they explained, adding that the p–n junction was formed radially to separate the absorbed
photons. “A surface passivation layer was also essential for minimizing the surface recombination of minority carriers in the TMW array as they have a large surface area.” They used a surface passivation layer made of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) with a thickness of 10 nm.
The solar cell built with this configuration achieved a power conversion efficiency of 18.7%, an open-circuit voltage of 598 mV, a short-circuit current of 39.8 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 78.4. The same cell built without the Al2O3 layer reached an efficiency of 16.1%, an open-circuit voltage of 568 mV, a short-circuit current of 37.3 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 75.8.
“Our c-Si TMW solar cell with effective Al 2 O3 passivation and radial junction efficiently separated and collected the generated multiple carriers,” they emphasized. “As a result, we have observed over 100% internal quantum efficiency (IQE) in our c-Si TMW solar cell in the UV region.”
The research team built the cell on a 4-inch wafer scale by applying a microgrid electrode with a uniform square pattern array with a width of 3–4 µm and a spacing of 400 µm. This cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 21.1% thanks to significantly improved open-circuit voltage and fill factor, which reached 608 mV and 80.3, respectively. The academics said this enhancement can be explained by the PV performance trend according to the area ratio of the edge electrode.
They described the device in the paper “Wafer-Scale Radial Junction Solar Cells with 21.1% Efficiency Using c-Si Microwires,” which was recently published in Advanced Functional Materials. “To the best of our knowledge, our work showed the highest power conversion efficiency among the previously reported MW-based radial junction solar cells,” they concluded. “In addition, there is more room for improving the efficiency of c-Si TMW solar cells.”

FTC Solar, which has been active in the Australian market since establishing an office in 2019, said Pioneer’s proprietary design reduces piles by 18% or more, delivering capital and labor cost reductions. It also features a shorter row length that reportedly enables higher energy density for a given block of land.
“Pioneer achieves a full 18%-36% pile count reduction per megawatt versus the current industry-leading solutions by volume,” FTC chief technology officer Nagendra Cherukupalli said. “And with a high-density design, Pioneer enables up to 5% greater energy output for the same site compared to the competition.”
Designed for utility-scale installations, the Pioneer tracking system accommodates 550 W and 600 W wide-format modules. FTC said the system supports all module factors, including those over 2.4 meters in length.
In addition, the company said no torque tube (TT) dimpling or through-bolts are required to index the module to the TT, allowing for module changes and retrofits. FTC said Pioneer’s distinctive TT shape allows for longer spans, improved torsional rigidity, and positive alignment of components without the need for penetrations.
FTC said the Pioneer system accommodates a 17.5% slope while zero-degree stow allows for reduced pile embedment depth. The design also allows the use of ground screw mounting systems to overcome challenging sub-surface conditions.
The tracker will operate independently from the grid during outages and is self-powered with battery back-up for up to three days.
The 500 MW agreement, signed with U.S.-based developer Primoris Renewable Energy, stipulates that FTC will supply its solar tracker technology for multiple project sites in the U.S. Primoris is expected to use the new Pioneer 1P tracker technology on multiple projects.
The Pioneer tracking system will make it public debut at the annual RE+ Power show in California this week. No details about when the Pioneer will be available in Australia have yet been provided.
