The focus of the joint initiative, called the Central European Hydrogen Corridor, is on developing a hydrogen corridor in Central Europe from Ukraine via Slovakia and the Czech Republic to hydrogen demand areas in Germany and other parts of the EU. Participating companies include Eustream (the Slovak gas TSO), Gas TSO of Ukraine (GTSOU), Net4gas (the Czech gas TSO), and OGE (a German gas TSO). “We are committed to making our infrastructure hydrogen-ready and thus strongly contribute to the EU’s decarbonization objectives,” Eustream General Director Rastislav Ňukovič commented on Thursday. Meanwhile, Eustream is also teaming up with Germany’s RWE Supply & Trading and infrastructure operators EP Infrastructure (EPIF) and NAFTA to jointly explore the potential development of blue hydrogen production facilities in eastern Slovakia. To this end, the companies have now signed a memorandum of understanding. “By 2023 we aim to be technologically ready to accept hydrogen blends of up to 5% into our system and in the future we are planning to dedicate one of our pipelines to pure hydrogen transmission,” Ňukovič said on Friday.
The German government published its Ordinance on the Allocation of Other Energy Production Areas in the Exclusive Economic Zone (SoEnergieV). It will enter into force next week, allowing the testing of hydrogen production from offshore electricity. “Until now, electrolysis for hydrogen production has only taken place on land. Business and industry will now have the opportunity to use and test offshore electrolysis for the first time,” the Federal Ministry of Economics wrote in a statement on Friday. The ordinance specifies the criteria according to which areas in the exclusive economic zone in the North Sea will be allocated for offshore hydrogen production. The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency is responsible for the award. “The production of green hydrogen at sea is a genuine future topic with high innovation potential. Offshore hydrogen production can make an important contribution to decarbonizing Germany as an industrial location,” commented economics minister Peter Altmaier. The first round of tenders is to be held as early as 2022. Successful bidders will first be granted the right to apply for a zoning procedure in an area. In a further step, they can apply for funding. The German government has decided in the energy and climate package to provide 50 million euros from 2022. Earlier this week, the German government approved the draft ordinance on the costs and charges for access to hydrogen networks. “Specifically, the regulation creates a reliable basis for calculating network costs, which are financed by hydrogen network operators through network charges,” reads the press release published on Wednesday. The government called its National Hydrogen Strategy a “success story,” but some critical voices among utilities described it as a “construction site.”
The Port of Rotterdam Authority and the DeltaPort Niederrheinhäfen signed a declaration of intent on Wednesday to strengthen their cooperation with the aim of “enabling this group of inland ports in the northern Ruhr area to be a regional hub for importing green hydrogen from the port of Rotterdam.” Other signatories included German companies Thyssengas, energy company Eon, cold store operator Nordfrost, and regional development company Kreis Wesel. The declaration confirms the intention of North Rhine-Westphalia to become Germany’s hydrogen hub. “The significance of this project goes way beyond our region,” commented Andreas Pinkwart, North Rhine-Westphalia's minister of economic affairs, innovation, digitisation and energy. Inland shipping and rail are expected to play a central role in the region’s hydrogen strategy. “We want to help developing a Cool Corridor, a regular inland shipping connection for reefer containers between Rotterdam and the Ruhr area,” said Emile Hoogsteden, commercial director at the Port of Rotterdam Authority. “With Nordfrost’s investment in a new centre for refrigeration logistics that can run on clean energy, we can help develop emission-free inland shipping connections with the deep-sea terminals in Rotterdam.”
European multinational aerospace corporation Airbus, French industrial gases and services company Air Liquide and French construction company and airport operator Vinci said they are working together to promote the use of hydrogen at airports and planning to build a European airport network to accommodate future hydrogen aircraft. “The airport of Lyon-Saint Exupéry (France) will host the first installations as early as 2023. This partnership reflects the three groups' shared ambition to combine their respective expertise to support the decarbonization of air travel,” the companies announced Tuesday, adding that by 2030, they would study the possibility of equipping Vinci Airports' European airport network with the hydrogen production, storage and supply facilities needed for use on the ground and onboard aircraft. Vinci Airports operates 45 airports in 12 countries.
British green hydrogen energy company Protium and service provider Petrofac signed a strategic partnership to deliver net-zero projects across the UK. “I am delighted to announce our partnership with Petrofac, whose world-leading experience in green hydrogen EPC work (notably with Infinite Blue Energy’s Arrowsmith project in Australia) will enable Protium to deliver exceptional projects for our clients,” commented Protium CEO Chris Jackson. The collaboration involves the development of renewable energy assets, green hydrogen production facilities, and downstream hydrogen equipment. “We’re delighted to combine Petrofac’s engineering, project management and operations capabilities with Protium’s green hydrogen and project development expertise to support its target to deliver 1 GW of production assets by 2030 for a range of industrial customers,” Petrofac COO John Pearson added.
British multinational chemicals company Ineos announced on Wednesday its intention to invest over €1.17 ($1.37) billion at its UK Grangemouth refinery, including in measures to support blue hydrogen production. “The Road Map involves a move to the production and use of hydrogen by all businesses at the Grangemouth site accompanied by carbon capture and storage of at least 1 million tonnes per annum of CO2 by 2030. This will include capturing CO2 from existing hydrogen production and the construction of a world-scale carbon capture enabled hydrogen production plant,” reads the press release.
The Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), which shipped a total of 5 billion cubic metres of natural gas from Azerbaijan to the Greek-Turkish border, said it is eying hydrogen transportation opportunities. “As per our long-term vision, TAP will continue to pursue opportunities to transport carbon neutral energy sources, such as hydrogen, reducing emissions, in line with European Union energy transition objectives,” TAP managing director Luca Schieppati said last week. TAP can expand in stages, up to double its initial capacity. For now, TAP can transport approximately 10 billion cubic meters of gas per annum to several European countries.

Recent research has identified the interface between the active perovskite material and other cell layers as the source of much performance loss. “…the ‘soft’ interface between the perovskite layer and charge transporting layer (CTL) is one of the major bottlenecks that limit operational stability and device longevity. The defects at this interface cause non-radiative recombination and thus lead to performance loss,” explained scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) in a newly published paper. “In addition, these interfacial defects promote the diffusion of halide ions across the interface into the CTL, which adversely affect the long-term operational stability.”
The group set out to address this challenge by adding a new layer to passivate defects at the interface between the perovskite and charge transport layers. A material called 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid ligand was coated on top of the perovskite layer, and shown to effectively passivate interface defects, and improve the cell performance and stability.
The research is described in full in the paper Nanoscale interfacial engineering enables highly stable and efficient perovskite photovoltaics, published in Energy & Environmental Science. The cells reached an initial efficiency of 23.4%. After 1,440 hours under continuous one-sun illumination, the unencapsulated cells had retained 87% of their initial performance value. Control samples produced without the additional passivation had lost more than 60% of their initial performance after 600 hours of illumination.
After an initial ‘burn in’ performance loss of around 8% over the first 50 hours, which EPFL says is a common feature of perovskite solar cells, the devices lost only another 5% over the next 1350 hours. By tracking the performance after the burn in period, the group showed that the device could operate for 5950 hours before degrading beyond 80% of its initial performance.
The group expects its work to open up new possibilities in investigating materials for interface passivation of perovskite devices, and more work to improve understanding of ion migration in the materials. “Overall, the scientific outcomes from this work are expected to have far researching consequences and initiate substantial further investigations in materials science, self-assembly, energy conversion, and optoelectronics, particularly to the development and understanding of functional nanoscale structures and interfaces of metal halide perovskites,” they conclude.

The grid operator said the map gives solar and wind project developers as well as regional grid operators direct insight into where and how much capacity is available at Tennet's high-voltage stations. Maximum available transport capacity has already been reached in a number of regions, the company warned, noting that if a high-voltage substation is marked in red, then there is currently no transport capacity available at that moment. It is also still possible to request congestion management if a substation is marked in blue.
Tennet specified that the map will be updated on a quarterly basis and that changes may occur if additional capacity becomes available due to an expansion of the infrastructure or if a station has reached its maximum capacity due to new grid-connection requests.
“The current map currently shows a large number of blue areas,” Tennet stated. “Due to the rapid growth of sustainable production, many applications have been made for a connection to the grid in these – mostly rural – regions.”
Tennet issued a warning earlier this month about the network congestion caused by the “rapid growth of wind and solar farms,” this time in the Gelderland and Flevopolder regions in the central and eastern Netherlands. Tennet said it expected to invest €450 million in upgrading the grid in the areas concerned. It is also exploring network congestion management using “a method based on the electricity market to create more space on the grid and at the same time prevent overloading of the electricity network.”
The Netherlands could reach between 38 GW and 125 GW of total installed solar capacity by 2050, according to a recent report by Netbeheer Nederland, the Dutch association of national and regional electricity and gas network operators.
Dutch power company Liander recently implemented several measures to increase grid capacity in several Dutch regions afflicted by grid constraints, which are preventing more renewable energy plants from coming online. These include the deployment of two giant transformers and the application of congestion management to a bottleneck in the grid.
In November 2020, Netbeheer Nederland and the Dutch renewable energy associations De Nederlandse Vereniging Duurzame Energie (NVDE) and Holland Solar signed a preliminary agreement to ensure faster and cheaper grid connection of large-scale solar power plants to the network.

The Navarra regional government is promoting a photovoltaic project proposed by Spain's National Association of Photovoltaic Energy Producers (Anpier) to generate sustainable electricity by covering with solar panels the Navarra Canal, one of the country's largest artificial irrigation canals.
The regional government said the project could have a capacity of up to 160 MW, which would mean doubling the PV capacity currently installed in the region.
Juan Antonio Cabrero, vice president and delegate of Navarra in Anpier, addressed the government of Navarra last April, indicating the multiple benefits of carrying out this project for the environment, as it is a clean source of electricity generation that would not lead to an occupation of large areas of natural land.
Cabrero also stressed that this kind of project would help reduce the evaporation of water, a scarce and necessary source for agricultural development in the region, noting that the cooling effect of the water is also beneficial to the energy business, as it increases the efficiency of the solar panels themselves. According to the government, the loss of water through evaporation would be avoided by 30%.
According to a study presented to the Department of Rural Development and Environment by companies Energi.k and Naga Solar, the proposed project is technically and financially viable as it would significantly avoid shadowing.
Anpier explains that this proposal is replicable in all channels with similar characteristics that exist in all the autonomous communities of Spain. “At Anpier, we have been supporting small and medium-sized photovoltaic installations and asked that they are implemented in places where distribution and transmission networks are more efficient, where existing infrastructures can be used, or in places that do not present natural heritage or without specific agricultural use, where the installations do not alter the natural habitats and farmland,” the association said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/24/circular-economy-could-support-indias-push-for-clean-energy-self-reliance/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 24, 2021","Circular economy could support India’s push for clean energy, self-reliance","From pv magazine India
With approximately 44 GW of installed PV capacity and 40 GW of installed wind capacity as of July – against a 450 GW renewables target for 2030 – the time has arrived for India to start creating an ecosystem to recycle solar panels and other electric components, said Saloni Sachdeva Michael, a consultant and the author of a newly released report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
The adoption of a “circular” approach to managing end-of-life solar PV modules, wind blades, and batteries would reduce future wastage of the high-value, critical raw materials needed for India’s massive clean energy transition, according to the IEEFA report.
The report notes that India does not yet have a dedicated renewable waste management and recycling policy. It calls for a national framework to be developed for domestic recycling of solar PV components, in particular.
Moving from a linear, “make-use-dispose” model to one built on circular principles, where resources are reused and recycled, could accelerate the decarbonization of the economy, cut waste, and reduce dependency on imports of raw materials for domestic solar module manufacturing, said IEEFA.
“Decarbonization based on circular principles is an opportunity to optimize usage of local resources, which would reduce dependency on imports. It would also reduce the amount of carbon emitted from raw materials used in the manufacture of wind, solar, and battery components and minimize waste,” it said. 
The potential value created by the recovery of raw materials from solar panels throughout the world could reach $450 million by 2030 and $15 billion by 2050, according to International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates cited in the report.
Main recommendations 
To make recycling a reality, India will need to take steps to overcome challenges such as how to make solar panel recycling economical. All stakeholders – including policymakers, regulators, manufacturers, assemblers, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) players, financiers, and consumers – need to work together to reduce the costs of recycling, said Sachdeva Michael.
The growth of solar panel recycling can create new jobs, domestic supply chain stability, and ancillary markets that utilize the recycled materials in other products.
“The biggest barriers to implementation are lack of incentives for developers and consumers to give away used solar panels, absence of a structured policy or regulation that defines the ownership of the end-of-life panels and the cost of transporting the panels to the recycling plant,” said Sachdeva Michael.
The report outlines recommendations in four key areas to encourage circular principles:
Policy and regulatory clarity – The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC) must work to establish standards for PV waste collection, treatment, and disposal. Developers and manufacturers must be encouraged to include the cost of decommissioning and recycling of PV panels in the bidding process, in power purchase agreements, and in operation and maintenance negotiations. Further, government tenders and contracts must include clear directions for the treatment and disposal of existing panels.
Producer Responsibility Organizations (PRO) – A program to strengthen the capacity of PROs should include renewables waste collection, segregation, dismantling, and recycling. 
Circular supply chain and inventory – The MNRE and MoEFCC need to track and monitor PV installations and their performance to quantify the number of panels reaching end of life. One key solution is to create storage spaces for degraded panels instead of throwing them into landfills. 
Innovative finance – There is a need to develop ancillary markets and pricing mechanisms for recycled products. India needs to create a mechanism for the adoption of environmental, social and governance frameworks to enable domestic manufacturers to attract green finance to set up recycling plants.

The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE has recently published a study in which the CO2 footprint of six monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic modules manufactured in China, Germany and the European Union was calculated.
The scientists considered the CO2 emissions that arise during the manufacture, transport and operation of the solar modules and found that the products with the lowest carbon footprint are those produced in Europe. “With PV modules manufactured in the EU, I save 40 percent in CO2 emissions compared to modules imported from China,” said Holger Neuhaus, head of Module Technology at Fraunhofer ISE, noting that the carbon footprint related not only to the savings in emissions caused by the transport, but also and primarily to the energy mix of the respective countries. On the other hand, the emissions that result from the transport of the solar modules from China to Europe only account for around 3% of total emissions, while the energy required for the module manufacturing has a share of between 50 and 63%.
For glass-glass solar modules manufactured in the EU, there are 420 kilograms of CO2 equivalents per kW of power, according to the Fraunhofer ISE's calculations. For glass-backsheet solar modules from the EU, there are 480 kilograms of CO2 equivalents per kW of power. When manufacturing in Germany, the researchers determined values of 520 and 580 kilograms of CO2 equivalents per kW of power.
When solar modules are produced in China, by contrast, 750 or kilograms of CO2 equivalents are produced per kW of power. The better values for glass-glass solar modules are based on the fact that they do not require an aluminum frame. Its production is very energy-intensive. In addition, glass-glass solar modules have a longer service life and less degradation than their glass-film counterparts, which also has a positive effect on the CO2 footprint. As to the kWh generated, the frameless glass-glass module causes 22 to 27 percent fewer CO2 emissions than the glass-backsheet module, the researchers explained
For its study, Fraunhofer ISE used the new production data that was collected in collaboration with the industry. “This is the real news. Compared to life cycle analyses based on older data sets that are still used today, the study showed that the carbon footprint of PV modules has improved by about 80 percent in recent years,” Neuhasu stated. “This is due to improvements in the silicon yield, the manufacturing processes of module efficiency and the CO2 intensity of power generation.”
Institute director Andreas Bett said the results confirmed the need for establishing a photovoltaic production chain in Europe. “Due to the significantly lower CO2 emissions during production and the further strong increase in demand for more climate-friendly PV modules worldwide, it is now a matter of establishing the PV production chain in Europe quickly and with a great deal of commitment.”
In recent years, large parts of PV production have been relocated from Europe to Asia, mainly to China. In 2019, China produced 68% of polysilicon, 96% of all wafers, 76% of all solar cells and 71% of solar modules worldwide.

Singapore-based Sun Cable has revealed that the AUD 30 billion ($21.9 billion) Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPL) project, which will supply electricity to Singapore from a massive solar PV farm and battery energy storage facility in Australia’s Northern Territory, is the “first of many” mega-projects it aims to develop.
This week, Sun Cable announced the generation capacity of what is already shaping up to be the world’s largest solar and storage project, with the PV farm increasing from the original 10 GW to between 17 GW and 20 GW. The capacity of the battery energy storage system has also been boosted, from an initial level of 20 GWh to between 36 GWh and 42 GWh of storage.
The project, which is being developed on a 12,000-hectare site at Powell Creek in the Northern Territory’s Barkly region, will supply power to Darwin and Singapore via a 4,500-kilometer high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission network, including a 750 km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800 km HVDC submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore.
Sun Cable Chief Executive David Griffin told pv magazine on Friday that the project is not expected to be fully operational until 2028. However, he said that the group has already started preparatory work on other “similar size” projects, including some which would be based in Australia.
“We have already commenced work on subsequent projects,” he said. “This is the first of a kind in terms of the scale and intercontinental transmission, but we want this to be the first of many.”
Sun Cable said it recently cleared a key regulatory hurdle when the Indonesian government approved the route for the AAPL transmission cable, which will pass through the country's waters. Indonesia’s coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, has confirmed that the country's government has recommended the route of the submarine cable and has granted a subsea survey permit.
Griffin said the approval notice was a significant milestone that brought Sun Cable closer to generating and transmitting “affordable, dispatchable renewable energy to Darwin and Singapore.”
“Given how much of the route passes through Indonesian waters, securing the support of the Indonesian government is critical,” he said. “It means we can now undertake the rest of our subsea survey and that’s crucial to getting into the detailed design. We are developing the technology that integrates solar, storage and high-voltage direct-current transmission technologies, to meet the large-scale demand for renewable energy.”
Sun Cable said the project, backed by billionaires Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes, has the potential to export AUD 2 billion worth of solar electricity each year and deliver total carbon emissions abatement of 8.6 million tons of CO2 a year. The project will also supply up to 15% of Singapore’s electricity needs from 2028, reducing the city-state’s emissions by about 6 million tons per year.
Cannon-Brooks, the co-founder and CEO of software giant Atlassian, said that securing Indonesian support for the project was a major step toward realizing Australia’s potential to become one of the world’s largest renewable energy exporters.
“Australia can become a renewable energy superpower,” he said. “We can and should tap into our solar resources that could power the world five times over. Sun Cable is harnessing this at scale, and its Australia-Asia PowerLink will create massive local and international renewable energy opportunities.”
Griffin said the decision to increase the capacity of the project, flagged last month, had been driven by customer demand for more consistent renewable energy generation and improvements in solar PV and battery technology.
“It is the result of a couple of years of really deep analysis of where solar and battery storage technology is, optimising the system, and responding to a better understanding of what the market is demanding in terms of electricity supply,” he said. “Improved efficiencies, particularly around solar technology, means we can have higher installed capacity on the same land mass. The other part is responding to our customers who really want a flatter supply 24/7. To meet that we needed to increase the generation and we needed to increase the storage capacity as well.”
While a construction start date is yet to be set, Sun Cable expects to reach financial close at the end of 2023 with the first electricity supplied to Darwin in 2026. The first electricity is set to be exported into Singapore in 2027 ahead of achieving full commercial operations at the end of 2028.

Generac, a U.S. manufacturer of backup power generation products for the residential, light commercial and industrial markets, has unveiled two new solar microinverter models for residential PV applications.
The Generac PWRmicro 1:1 is a single-module microinverter, while the PWRmicro 2:1 is a 720W, dual-module microinverter. Generac said the products will be available to order and ship in early 2022.
The units have integrated grounding and modular bus cabling, which Generac said reduces install times through simplified wiring. The two model types are compatible, so installers may have greater design flexibility, with the ability to mix and match.
Generac partnered with Chilicon Power in July to bring the microinverters to market. They were originally supposed to be unveiled at Solar Power International New Orleans this month, but damages and power outages caused by Hurricane Ida canceled the in-person event.
The microinverter product release continues Generac’s move into the solar and energy storage space. The company also offers a backup battery storage solution, the PWRcell, which features a modular design. The PWRcell battery can scale from a three-module, 9 kWh capacity, 4.5 kW output, to a six-module, 18 kWh, 9kW output. If more storage is needed, multiple PWRcell battery cabinets can be integrated to a single Generac PWRcell inverter for up to 36 kWh capacity and 11 kW continuous backup power.
The PWRcell string inverters come in 7.6 kW and 11.4 kW models, with peak efficiencies of 97.3% and 97.7%, respectively.
