US battery manufacturing got a boost this week with the announcement of $3.1 billion in funding from President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
The infrastructure investment is intended to increase American-made batteries and components, bolster domestic supply chains, create good-paying jobs, and lower costs. The plan is to support the creation of new, retrofitted, and expanded commercial facilities as well as manufacturing demonstrations, and battery recycling. According to a recent PV Intel report, California is an example of a burgeoning US battery market with a big  increase in solar-plus-battery installations just in the past year.
The Department of Energy (DOE) also announced a separate $60 million to support second-life applications for batteries once used to power EVs, as well as new processes for recycling materials back into the battery supply chain. These funding opportunities are part of the government’s strategy to bolster America’s supply chain and reduce the reliance on competing nations. Currently China is the leader in the global lithium-ion battery production market, according to a Wood Mackenzie report. And while the US is supporting its battery industry, China is investing heavily to build out more manufacturing facilities to extend its dominance. Secondarily, these initiatives support the president’s goal of electric vehicles making up half the vehicle sales in North America by 2030.
“Positioning the United States front and center in meeting the growing demand for advanced batteries is how we boost our competitiveness and electrify our transportation system,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “President Biden’s historic investment in battery production and recycling will give our domestic supply chain the jolt it needs to become more secure and less reliant on other nations – strengthening our clean energy economy, creating good paying jobs, and decarbonizing the transportation sector.”
With increased proliferation of electric vehicles, the global lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade. In addition to ramping up R&D and manufacturing, responsible and sustainable domestic sourcing of the critical materials such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite, will help avoid or mitigate supply chain disruptions and accelerate battery production in America.
“I secured provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support the domestic critical mineral supply chain used in battery production,” said US Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (Nevada). “Nevada’s innovation economy is at the forefront of battery manufacturing and recycling, and the infrastructure law could bring vital new investments to the state.”
The “Battery Materials Processing and Battery Manufacturing” and “Electric Drive Vehicle Battery Recycling and Second Life Applications” funding opportunities are aligned with the National Blueprint for Lithium Batteries, authored by the Federal Consortium for Advanced Batteries, and led by DOE and the Departments of Defense, Commerce, and State.
These funding opportunities are the first to be released as a collaboration between DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the new Office of Manufacturing and Supply Chains, created by the DOE’s organizational realignment to ensure that the Department has the structure needed to effectively implement the clean energy investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Energy Act of 2020.

The project agreements should now be signed by the end of September.
“The department has engaged Eskom extensively on these matters and Eskom has committed to a timetable that will enable the first batch of 14 projects to sign their projects agreements at end of July 2022, accommodating those preferred bidders that will receive their budget quotes by the end of June 2022,” the DMRE said. “The
remaining 11 projects are expected to receive their Budget Quotes by August 2022, which will enable the signing of the balance of project agreements by the end of September 2022.”
The fifth round of the REIPPPP scheme was launched in March 2021. Overall, the South African authorities have allocated 2.6 GW of renewable energy capacity across 25 projects ranging in size from 75 MW to 140 MW.
The procurement exercise's lowest bid of ZAR 0.34425 ($0.02338) was submitted for a 124 MW wind facility to be built in Hantam, in the Northern Cape region. For solar, the lowest price was ZAR 0.37479, which was offered for six 75 MW solar parks set for construction in Tokologo, an administrative area in the Lejweleputswa District of the Free State region.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/05/large-area-semitransparent-perovskite-pv-module-with-9-5-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SINGAPORE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 5, 2022",Large-area semitransparent perovskite PV module with 9.5% efficiency,"Scientists at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore have fabricated a large-area semitransparent perovskite solar panel for applications in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), vehicle-integrated solar, and smart glasses.
“The results on our minimodule will encourage the development of the next generation performance-optimized and aesthetically pleasing buildings- and product-integrated photovoltaics,” researcher Monika Rai told pv magazine.
The device purportedly reduces the typical losses that semitransparent panels show compared to opaque modules. This was achieved through three different strategies: a new passivation technique, a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer with minimum physical damage to the underlying perovskite, and a down-converting phosphor material that harvests low energy photons.
The main concern of the scientists was the interaction behavior of the semitransparent perovskite film used for the cell with the transparent top contacts, which has lower absorption and poorer film quality.
“It is severely susceptible to degradation due to under-coordinated ions at its crystal surfaces and the grain boundaries,” they said, noting that Eu3+ ion doping was used to improve the quality and stability of perovskite precursors
The highly transparent and conducting TCO was fabricated via tin-doped indium-oxide (ITO) sputter deposition.
“Careful tuning of power and substrate distance is performed to reduce perovskite damage while obtaining a conductive clear ITO film free of delamination,” the group said.
They interconnected the solar cells via P1, P2, and P3 scribes to build a mini module with an active area of 4.9 cm2 × 4.3 cm2 and a substrate area of 6 cm2 × 6 cm2. Under standard illumination, the device achieved a maximum efficiency of 9.5% with a visible transmittance of up to 20%, which the scientists described as the best so far for this area and architecture. Under low light illumination, the efficiency was raised to 12.%.
“Increasing module size is indeed an engineering hurdle and requires R&D support. But, there is a definite potential as perovskite solar cells scalability is now proven by different coating techniques,” Rai explained. “Our fully semi-transparent module serves as a strong prototype for BIPV/window applications.”
The research group described the module in “Multimodal Approach towards Large Area Fully Semitransparent Perovskite Solar Module,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.

(SPIC), gatecrashed the latest ranking of the world's biggest solar project companies, compiled by British analyst Wiki-Solar.
State-owned SPIC entered the 30-strong list of engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) service companies to have built more than a gigawatt of solar generation capacity, at No. 23 and from a standing start.
Shanghai Electric constructed three grand projects with a total generation capacity of 1.36 GWac between the start of 2021 and April 19, 2022, when Wiki-Solar released its latest ranking.
US top dogs
Two US companies top the table, with the caveat that a lack of publicly available information about projects in China ensures companies in the world's solar capital are under-represented in the Wiki-Solar figures.
The 22 projects built by Solv Energy, with a total generation capacity of 3.1 GW since Jan. 1, 2021, kept that business top of the pile, ahead of compatriot First Solar. The latter is winding down its EPC activity, as evidenced by the fact it constructed only one 200 MW solar field during the same period. Solv has built 9.45 GW of solar capacity to date, and First Solar 4.72 GW, according to Wiki-Solar.
India's Sterling & Wilson added five projects with a total generation capacity of 756 MW over the 15.5-month period, to bring its cumulative total to 3.76 GW and sit third in the list.
There was plenty of activity at US business McCarthy Building, which doubled its historic total by building a dozen plants with an aggregate 1.65 GW of capacity, to reach 3.08 GW; and at Greek outfit Metka EGN, which added a dozen sites with 1.05 GW of panels to hit 1.73 GW.
In terms of project numbers, French concerns Bouygues and Eiffage had a busy period, the former installing 32 farms with a total capacity of 437 MW, to reach 2.09 GW, and the latter 26 projects with 1.5 GW of its cumulative 3.43 GW total. Solv and German peer Baywa Re each worked on 22 sites, with Baywa adding 922 MW over the reporting period to reach 2.18 GW to date.
No new projects
At the other end of the scale, US business SunEdison – which is in insolvency, according to Wiki-Solar – not surprisingly failed to add any projects during the period concerned. US peer Cypress Creek and Spanish EPC Sener were also inactive, according to the analyst.
German company Enerparc, which is the business on the Wiki-Solar ranking with the highest number of developed projects – 259 – added just one of those during the period in question, a 4 MW installation, to take its cumulative total to 2.34 GW.

Lift Energy Storage Technology (LEST) is a proposed long-term storage solution. It relies on the use of elevators in buildings to lift solid masses in charging mode. It lowers the same mass to produce electricity in discharge mode.
“Energy is stored as potential energy by elevating storage containers with an existing lift in the building from the lower storage site to the upper storage site,” the scientists said. “Electricity is then generated by lowering the storage containers from the upper to the lower storage site.”
The proposed system could detect the position of containers and optimize available storage capacity in the upper and lower storage sites through dedicated software. Building owners could choose to only operate the system during periods of low elevator demand, in order to minimize its impact on building occupants. The elevators can run at different speeds, depending on storage requirements.
“When the lifts are not being used, such as during the night, the autonomous trailers can fill the lift with containers and the lift can be used to provide ancillary services to the power grid by lifting and descending the mass continuously on grid requirements,” the academics said.

The economic viability of the system depends on the cost of the storage space. If this is low, the scientists said that a mixture of sand and water could be a feasible solution. The number of storage containers depends on a building's ceiling-bearing capacity.
The researchers assumed that the elevators have regenerative braking capabilities and that the cost of renting the containers' storage space in the upper and lower sites would be zero.
“The only cost requirements are the containers, the material selected to increase the mass of the containers, and the autonomous trailers,” they said.
Considering an average height difference between the upper and lower reservoirs of 100 meters, the cost of installed capacity energy storage cost was found to be approximately $62/kWh.
“The cost of LEST with an average height difference of 300 meters is $21/kWh, whereas an average height difference of 50 meters costs $128/kWh. This is half of the cost of storing energy with batteries.”
The technical lifetime of the system is estimated between 20 and 30 years and its capacity will be strictly dependent on the number of existing lifts.
“The higher the height difference between the lower and upper storage sites, the lower the cost of the project,” the research team said.
The noted a multi-elevator lift developed by German industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp that only uses magnetic force to move the lifts, as an ideal solution for the LEST system.
“This allows the lift to move vertically, horizontally and diagonally, and it is particularly interesting for high-rise buildings because several lifts can travel up or down at the same time in the same shaft,” they said.
The scientists presented the gravitational tech in “Lift Energy Storage Technology: A solution for decentralized urban energy storage,” which was recently published in Energy. The research team includes academics from Austria's International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), the Federal University of Espírito Santo in Brazil, the Wrocław University of Science and Technology in Poland, and the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences in Germany.
“LEST systems are particularly interesting in buildings with rope-free elevators, and they can also provide tuned mass damper services on the top of very high buildings,” they said. “LEST systems are particularly interesting during the night when most lifts are not being used, as the autonomous trailers can continue to fill the lifts with containers to provide ancillary services to the power grid.”

“The piece is usable on panels that have frame heights of 40 mm, 35 mm or 30 mm, and thickness between 8 mm and 11 mm. It is suited for modules with slopes between 3 degrees and 20 degrees,” the company’s co-founder, António Peres, told pv magazine.
The device was designed with rooftop installations in mind, where difficult accessibility and height-related risks make soiling an even greater concern for operations and maintenance contractors. While the device cannot replace cleaning, which remains essential, “the goal is to improve the energy production between cleaning cycles by preventing the soiling impact,” Peres said.
The company claims energy gains of 3.5% on average, with better performance being achieved with solar panels in portrait position, when soiling at the bottom of the module affects all its three substrings.
In a case study, the company showed the gains between two equal strings in the same installation – one installed with Solarud and one without.
“The modules were all cleaned on week zero and we then compared the performance of the strings on week 13,” Peres said.
The company developed and produces the device in Portugal. It is available for bulk purchases, starting at 50 units for €100 ($106), or €2 per unit. Each piece weighs 6 grams and is made of UV-resistant recyclable plastic for longer durability.
The company is focused on the European market but distributes globally. Its main clients are investors and project owners seeking fast returns on investment, as well as O&M companies looking to provide better performance alongside their cleaning services.

German PV module supplier Solarwatt has signed an agreement with Stiebel Eltron to cooperate on the development of heat pumps.
Dresden-based Solarwatt sees the deal as its next step to becoming a sector coupler. Previously, it has signed an electromobility partnership with German carmaker BMW.
“If we consistently implement sector coupling in single-family homes, we can save 20% to 25% of CO2 emissions in Germany,” said Managing Director Detlef Neuhaus.
The companies will cooperate on Solarwatt Manager flex, an energy management system that integrates thermal energy management technology from Stiebel Eltron with an electrical management tool from Solarwatt. It prioritizes connected consumers and considers the use of an electric car and a heat pump.
The system increases the efficiency in the house by planning the switch-on times, so outside temperatures are as high as possible. In order to achieve this goal, the system creates a timetable for when the heat pump is to be switched on. Communication between the energy management system and the heat pumps is then no longer implemented with an SG-ready standard app, but via the Modbus data communications protocol, which provides more control options.
The German federal government's goal is to install 600,000 heat pumps per year – an increase of about four times from current levels.
“In our cooperation, we ask ourselves how we can achieve this,” said Nicholas Matten, managing director of sales for Stiebel Eltron.
He also does not see any alternatives. Private households account for around 30% of the total energy requirement and space heating is the dominant part. He sees many possible uses for hydrogen, but not for heating. The electricity requirement when heating with electrically generated green hydrogen is five to eight times higher than with heat pump heating.
Matten does not see any major limitations for the use of heat pumps.
“We have solutions that allow us to heat almost any building with heat pump technology,” he said. “You don't necessarily have to insulate the facade, even if that naturally affects the energy costs … In the past, heat pumps were slowed down in a similar way to photovoltaics through the price structure. Electricity prices were among the highest in Europe, and gas was particularly cheap and that's about to change.”

Australia's Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) has joined Dutch investment fund Teslin Participates in providing new growth capital to HyET Solar to support the delivery of a Netherlands-based factory that is expected to produce at least 40 MW of thin-film solar PV modules a year.
FFI confirmed the investment in a statement this week, but did not disclose the sum. The transaction comes after the Australian company acquired a 60% stake in High Yield Energy Technologies (HyET) Group in October 2021. Thew group’s assets include HyET Solar and hydrogen technology specialist HyET Hydrogen.
FFI has identified HyET Solar’s lightweight Powerfoil solar technology as a key contributor as it looks to produce “millions of tons of cost-competitive green hydrogen by 2030, to support the sustainability targets of its parent company Fortescue and the worldwide energy transition.”
FFI, which plans to establish a 1 GW Powerfoil manufacturing plant at Gladstone in Queensland, said that by manufacturing the flexible solar modules and electrolyzers at immense scale, it aims to drive down the cost of both products and hasten the delivery of affordable green energy to the world.
FFI, which was founded by iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest, has repeatedly declared it intends to build a global portfolio of renewable green hydrogen and green ammonia projects to produce 15 million tons per year of green hydrogen by 2030, rising to 50 million tons per year in the decade thereafter.
“Already we have a memorandum of understanding in place with E.ON to supply Germany with 5 million tons per annum by 2030. We invested in HyET in 2021 and we are already seeing growth in the value of this investment,” said FFI CEO Julie Shuttleworth
HyET Solar Director Rombout Swanborn said the latest investments by FFI and Teslin would support the development of the company’s Dutch manufacturing plant and assist with the roll out of its business worldwide.
“HyET Solar has the ambition to manufacture at large scale very low-cost PV products offering innovative application possibilities,” he said. “HyET Solar products are lightweight, flexible and based on thin-film silicon and perovskite technologies. With the investments of Teslin Participates and FFI, two powerful and complementary strategic partners, HyET Solar finds itself in a very attractive position to rapidly roll out its business worldwide.”
Swanborn said the Powerfoil technology is a lightweight, fully flexible, thin-film solar PV module suitable for high-volume markets such as utility scale solar farms as well as high-value markets such as building integrated PV. The company claims the ultra-low weight (0.6 kg/m2) and cheap materials used for its solar technology means it can be installed at a 30% reduction on the levelized cost of energy compared to traditional crystalline-silicon glass modules.
HyET said its Powerfoil technology will allow it to drastically reduce the cost of solar power and is targeting a cost structure for modules of $100k/MW.
FFI’s investment in HyET Solar comes just days after it signed a deal with New Zealand’s biggest gas pipelines operator, Firstgas, to investigate the development of green hydrogen projects in that nation. It said this week that it has signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Firstgas to identify opportunities to produce and distribute green hydrogen to tens of thousands of homes and businesses in New Zealand.
FFI and Firstgas will undertake feasibility studies to assess the technical, commercial and operational factors of any projects, which could include the possible use of existing energy assets.
Firstgas is New Zealand’s largest gas network, with more than 2,500 km of high-pressure transmission pipelines and 4,800 km of distribution pipelines in the North Island, connecting more than 300,000 homes and businesses to gas.

Lithion said this week that its lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) residential battery is now UL-certified when paired with Sol-Ark 12K hybrid inverters. The company achieved UL 9540 certification after going through rigorous testing for reliability and safety.
The Stack’d Series LFP batteries are a modular platform that can be scaled in 4.8 kWh increments, from 9.6 kWh to 38.4 kWh. The company is vertically integrated, using its own Tier 1 prismatic cells in the composition of the battery.
While many battery providers claim whole home backup capability, central A/C and other large appliances may not be able to start up after an outage, Lithion said. The company’s battery is capable of up to 16.8 kW surge and 14.4 kW continuous power, providing true whole-home backup.
LFP batteries are known for their reduced fire risk due to the elimination of cobalt, which is known to be connected to mining practices that have human rights and environmental concerns. The company said its batteries are designed to be readily recyclable at the end of their lifecycle.
The battery is paired with a low-voltage 48 V system, IP55 water and dust resistance, and a proprietary battery management system, all elements of the safety and stability of the battery. A 10-year, 4,000-cycle full-refund warranty is included.
Sol-Ark said the battery makes a good match for its inverters, boosting ease of install. “With our upcoming Sol-Ark 15K, the Stack’d Series battery will be the only battery on the market to maximize its capability,” said Bhawna Oberoi, COO of Sol-Ark.
Lithion’s modular designs make a “drop-in” solution for replacing lead acid batteries, designing them to be easy to implement without retooling efforts. This leads to cuts in purchasing, inventory, and servicing costs, said Lithion. The company is headquartered in Henderson, Nevada.
Sol-Ark is a Texas-based company started in 2013 by local US veterans with experience in semiconductors and power electronics. It has multiple production lines for its inverter lines, including the Sol-Ark 12K hybrid, which makes for a full home backup and off-grid solution when paired with the Stack’d Series batteries.
