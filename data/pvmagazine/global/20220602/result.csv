They used a commercially available 3-µm-thick parylene C and embedded it in the solar cell via a flip-over transferring (FOT) technique. They claimed that this ensured that the polymer had a smooth surface. They also used chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for the deposition of the parilene C on the pre-cleaned glass substrate.
In addition, the scientists used a 210-nm-thick zirconium (Zr), titanium (Ti) and gallium doped indium oxide (ITGZO) as the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) electrodes of the solar cell. They used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to compare the performance of the cell with a reference device based on parylene F, which is another type of polymer, and a cell with a glass substrate without the polymer.
“The perovskite films on parylene-F exhibited poor film coverage with several pinholes on the film surface and showed interfacial voids at embedded bottom interfaces which would lead to charge accumulation and induce the loss of device performance,” the scientists said. “For perovskite films prepared on parylene-C, better film uniformity same as glass-based films was obtained as evidenced by the disappearance of surficial pinholes and interfacial voids.”
The parylene-C-based PV cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 20.2%, which is a value that the researchers describe as in line with that of perovskite cells of common thickness.
“Due to the high PCE and light device weight of 6.67 g/m2 on parylene-C substrates, an outstanding power-per-weight of 30.3 W/g was realized, indicating the great promise of fabricating efficient, ultrathin and ultralight solar cells with parylene-C films,” they concluded.
The researchers presented their findings in “Ultralight flexible perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Science China Materials.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/02/reaching-beyond-efficiency-limits/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JUNE 2, 2022",Reaching beyond efficiency limits,"So-called “hot carrier” solar cells (HCSCs) offer one theoretical path to conversion efficiencies beyond today’s theoretical limits. By isolating and capturing energy from particles carrying excess kinetic energy that is usually lost as heat, the concept promises cell efficiencies well beyond 30%, even for a single junction device.
The theory has been around for several decades, but so far, no hot carrier cell has been successfully fabricated. The “imperfections” that would limit practical performance of such a device, in comparison to models of what is theoretically possible, are not well understood.
Scientists led by Japan’s University of Tokyo investigated the resilience of HCSCs to these “non-ideal” scenarios, and introduced a “hot carrier multijunction solar cell” (HCMJ) as an approach that modeling showed could be less vulnerable. They described the research in “Hot carrier multijunction solar cells: sensitivity and resilience to nonidealities,” which was recently published in Journal of Photonics for Energy.
While the model showed the HCSC as having the highest efficiency potential, the HCMJ demonstrated a lower drop in performance when other non-optimal designs were used. They also model performance of the cells under different light and temperature conditions, and were able to widen the list of materials potentially suitable for hot carrier devices.
“Hot-carrier photovoltaics have been proposed since the early 1980s as a way to achieve higher efficiencies that break the conventional ‘detailed-balance’ limit, but they have yet to be realized in practice,” explained Sean Sheehan, editor-in-chief of the journal that published the research. “The work by Giteau and colleagues provides a strategy to bring them closer to fruition by loosening the constraint of near-perfect materials, which otherwise easily reduces the performance of real-world devices.”

Austrian Minister for Climate Protection Leonore Gewessler has announced budget increases for the second round of the nation's rebate scheme for solar-plus-storage installations, to be held on June 21.
The government has earmarked an additional €40 million ($42.5 million) on top of the €20 million it initially allocated for the round.
“The text for the amendment is not yet available, but the new ordinance is expected to be published shortly,” a spokesperson for the national solar association, Bundesverband Photovoltaic Austria, told pv magazine.
However, it is still unclear if the increased funds for the second round will be deducted from the budget allocated for the third and fourth rounds. In the first round, a total of €40 million was allocated across 11,000 projects.
Rebates are available for installations up to 10 kW in size, covering up to €285/kW installed. Overall, the Austrian government wants to provide at least €285 million across more solar project categories in 2022.
“We see this rapid reaction to the high demand as very positive, but we are already pointing out the essential continuity to the responsible ministry,” said Vera Immitzer, managing director of Bundesverband Photovoltaic Austria. “We will closely monitor the third and fourth funding call in 2022 and, if necessary, clearly request the missing budget. In the current market upswing, continuity has top priority for both the population and companies.”
The organization says the successful expansion of PV will largely depend on the expansion of grid infrastructure, which should be designed for decentralized producers.
“Austria has completely missed out on the extensive grid expansion that we all need for a 100 percent renewable power supply in recent years,” complained Herbert Paierl, CEO of Bundesverband Photovoltaic Austria. “The power grid is becoming a bottleneck for the energy transition and seems to be almost fully utilized. It cannot be that we lose the expansion momentum that we have just achieved because the infrastructure is not being expanded at the same pace.”

France's Ministry of Ecological Transition has reported that around 484 MW of new PV systems were connected to the grid in the January-March period, from 736 MW in the same period a year earlier.
Installations above 250 kW in size accounted for about 47% of the new solar capacity. Installations below 9 kW in size represented 86% of the number of the newly connected units and 13% of all new capacity.
France reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 14.6 GW at the end of March, with 13.8 GW of the total on the French mainland. The aggregate capacity of queued solar projects with grid-connection requests has increased by 16% since the start of the year to 13.4 GW, including 2.9 GW with signed connection agreements.
In the first quarter of the year, solar production stood at 3.2 TWh, from 2.4 TWh during the same period in 2021. Solar generation accounts for 2.2% of French electricity consumption, down from 3.7% a year earlier.
The regions of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur accounted for 65% of the newly connected power in the first quarter. They are the regions with the highest installed capacities, representing 66% of all cumulative power connected in France by the end of March.

“Staff was able to disconnect the damaged strings and the 1.8 MW of power is now providing clean, green electricity to the grid,” said Stanislav Ignatiev, the CEO of the company that owns the facility, Solar Generation.
The Merefa solar plant, which is located 30 km south of Kharkiv, is the largest industrial solar station in the region. It provides electricity to the city of Merefa, a suburb of Kharkiv.

“This project is a vivid example of distributed generation, which is aimed at supplying energy to a small town,” said Ignatiev, noting that it features Talesun 325 W PV modules and 27 kW Fronius ECO 27.0-3-S string inverters.
The missiles damaged 416 solar panels, as well as four inverters.

“This type of damage is typical for a rocket or projectile hitting solar power plants in Ukraine,” Ignatiev said. “It should be noted that the station was built on a swampy area using geo-screws, so the supporting structures of the station were damaged locally as a result of the missile attack.”

India’s cumulative rooftop solar capacity reached 7.6 GW by March 31, with 456 MW added in the first quarter, according to a new report by Mercom India.
Rooftop solar installations rose 34% year on year in the January-March period. They accounted for 15% of 3 GW of quarterly solar installations.
The commercial and industrial segment once again accounted for most of the rooftop solar installations in the first quarter. The industrial segment contributed 47% of total quarterly additions.
“States have been empaneling vendors and commissioning the allocated capacities under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s Phase II Rooftop Solar Program, driving capex installations,” said the report.
Gujarat leads other states in cumulative solar rooftop installations, with about 1.8 GW installed byon March 31. Maharashtra and Rajasthan rank second and third, said Mercom.
Overall project margins have fallen with the rise in component prices, the imposition of a basic customs duty (BCD) on module and cell imports, and an increase in the goods and service tax. In the first quarter of 2022, the average cost of a rooftop solar system increased by 6% on a quarterly basis from the final three months of 2021. Year over year, rooftop solar system costs increased by 17%.
“It was another great quarter for the rooftop solar market as post-covid installations continued to surge. Rooftop installations have topped 400 MW for four quarters in a row, which is a first,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. “However, future growth is dependent on system costs. If the prices continue to go up and project economics deteriorate, demand is bound to contract in the short term.”

“Some features such as color control, visible range transparency, low dependence on the light angle, optimal response in diffuse light condition, thermal and light stability and environmental sustainability makes DSSC technology very attractive for BIPVs applications,” researcher Luigi Vesce told pv magazine. “The modules developed in our work gathered all these features thanks to materials, design and process optimization. Their transparency reaches 36%, which makes the manufactured large area devices good candidates to act as glazing building envelopes, curtain-wall facades or large skylights.”
A 400 cm2 module with an efficiency of 5.1% and transparency of 35.7% was initially built with 12 semitransparent cells based on a dye known as TTZ5,a thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TzTz). The scientists claim it offers strong visible light absorption.
“Modules are designed by considering the trade-off between low losses and device sturdiness,” they said.
Nine of the modules were then assembled in a large panel with an area of 0.2 sm and an efficiency of 2.7% in outdoor conditions, with a tilt angle of 60 C.
“The modules show no structural failures, electrolyte leakage, or other signs of degradation,” the academics said. “According to ISOS-D-2 and ISOS-L-1 standard tests, the modules are stable for more than 1,000 hours at 85 C and under light soaking without any electrolyte leakage, collectors corrosion or delamination.”
The researchers used a screen-printing technique to deposit silver conductors and bus bars on both cell's electrodes and the titanium oxide (TiO2) film. They embedded a photo-electrode (PE) and a counter-electrode (CE) into the cell.
“The width of the conductors was optimized according to the trade-off between the highest possible active area, sufficient space for sealant and maximum power output,” they said. “Electrodes were fired at 120 C for 30 minutes to dry the ink before the deposition of TiO2.”
The researchers described their project in “Process Engineering of Semitransparent DSSC Modules and Panel Incorporating an Organic Sensitizer,” which was recently published in RRL Solar.

A consortium led by Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology IEE is now coordinating a research project to assess how components of GaN inverters can be further miniaturized, in order to achieve lower production costs.
“The aim behind the usage of GaN for power electronic inverters is not primarily focused on efficiency improvements,” Sebastian Sprunck, group leader for components and measuring systems at Fraunhofer IEE, told pv magazine. “Si and SiC-based converters, already reach or exceed 98 % efficiency in certain applications and improving on those values may be possible from a technology point-of-view, but is rarely economically feasible.”
He said the primary goal when using GaN in power electronics is usually the optimization and miniaturization of the entire inverter device, including passive components such as cooling systems, casings, and mounting structures.
“When components are miniaturized through this approach, we can potentially harness benefits such as lower material consumption and costs, as well as lighter products, which would reduce costs and efforts required for packaging, delivery and installation,” Sprunck said. “We’re amongst the first research projects to apply GaN to high-power solar inverters, therefore we can only extrapolate possibilities which we need to validate over the course of our project.”
The achievable size reduction is dependent on several parameters and is subject to ongoing study.
“In general, we’re hoping on similar reduction factors that were demonstrated with SiC in comparison to Si technology, only now comparing GaN with SiC. However, it is not possible to directly compare such factors across differing power and/or voltage classes,” Sprunck explained. “Some preliminary results for the power inductors of the GaN-HighPower project are already available and we are now evaluating them.”
The consortium is now developing its first GaN inverter prototype. It aims to test it in late 2022 or early 2023, with a more integrated demonstrator planned for late 2023. The project aims at converter powers above 100 kVA.
Sprunck noted that GaN is already under investigation in several lower-power applications.
“High power applications such as industrial PV projects of over 100 kW are not typical for GaN, at least not in the short term and it's currently a challenge to apply these devices to such high power converters, which is one of the reasons we’re conducting this project in the first place,” he said. 
The use of gallium nitride in inverters could also allow for higher switching frequencies and smaller passive components such as power inductors or capacitors, which are often the largest, heaviest components in power converters.
“If they can be miniaturized, then often the inverter case can be as well,” Sprunck said. “Other projects utilizing GaN power semiconductors in lower-power applications have shown that these effects can lead to lower manufacturing costs. One of the tasks of this project is to investigate if these effects can also be harnessed for high-power applications.”
Infineon Technologies, SMA Solar Technology, and Vacuumschmelze (VAC) also participated in the research project. In addition, the Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences is preparing the integration of new components into a technology demonstrator, while TH Köln University of Applied Sciences is helping with the design and optimization of power electronic inductors.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/02/ci-rooftops-turn-toward-the-sun/,"MARKETS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,BRAZIL,CHINA,EUROPE,WORLD",,"JUNE 2, 2022",C&I rooftops turn toward the sun,"Expect the roofs of global distribution facilities, manufacturing plants, industrial estates and retail stores to sprout solar at a steady rate of watts over the coming months. A still relatively underserved market for solar systems, the commercial and industrial (C&I) sector will become increasingly renewable-energy hungry as governments twiddle the dials on incentives that help them deliver on decarbonization targets, and fossil fueled electricity generation continues to ride the price rollercoaster.
“The economics behind solar uptake are based on the retail electricity price versus the cost of putting solar on your roof, the solar resource and the government incentives to go renewable,” says David Dixon, senior analyst for Australian renewables at Rystad Energy.
Rystad Energy further observes that the highest uptake regions for rooftop C&I solar have high retail electricity prices and large available rooftop space, which would put Germany ahead of China among countries heading for the sun. And historically that holds true.
Germany’s C&I sector began its rooftop uptake in response to incentives such as high feed-in tariffs way back in the early 2000s, when PV modules were still manufactured in the central European power house, and electricity prices were already high. In the 2010s, however, China took over the major-market mantle (as well as burgeoning module manufacturing). And as Dixon points out, “policy settings can have extreme effects in China, where a couple of percentage points here and there make a huge difference because of the size of the market.”
Going forward, analysts at IHS Markit read the incentivized C&I runes a little differently, placing Brazil a distant second to China, and Germany in third place – at least for 2022. Siqi He, research analyst for clean technology and renewables for IHS Markit, says that figures indicate that China will install 36 GW of C&I rooftop solar in 2022. Brazil will put 4.6 GW on its C&I rooftops, while Germany will pump out an extra 4.1 GW from C&I.
A significant driver in China, says He, has been the National Energy Administration’s mid-2021 call for a number of counties to be nominated for a trial program to promote rooftop solar pilot projects. IHS Markit’s figures indicate that 676 of China’s mostly developed counties or cities have already been approved for the pilot program.
In Brazil, the approval in August 2021 of a new distributed generation regulatory framework will see the gradual rescinding of grid access privileges (such as exemption from grid charges) for existing micro (up to 75 kW) and mini (75 kW to 5,000 kW) distributed systems, up to 2045. But a 12-month grace period will see thousands of systems apply for access in the meantime, so that they can bask in the benefits for as long as possible. “We expect the absolute number of C&I installations in Brazil to slow down from 2024 [at the end of the grace period,” says He.
In Germany, a combination of high retail electricity prices, the adoption of a number of rooftop PV incentives, as well as geopolitical factors are at play. The EU as a whole is seeking to reduce its reliance on Russian gas by diversifying its gas supplies into renewable gases and transitioning heating and power generation away from gas and into renewables. Germany itself, says He, does have a fair bit of C&I solar installations already, but further policy changes will drive a renewed boom. He cites one new policy as Germany’s 2021 raising of the solar system size cap for surcharges payable on self-consumed electricity from 10 kW to 30 kW – which favours C&I systems.
Globally, IHS Markit expects 81 GW of C&I rooftop solar to be installed in 2022, and for this number to increase by 54% by 2026, when it forecasts 125 GW of installations.
Dixon says inverter fortunes largely follow the solar market – both on the utility and smaller scale. However, he adds that any likely dip in solar uptake due to currently higher module and/or shipping costs, may be made up for on the inverter side by an increase in battery sales, where the addition of a battery might require installation of a new, bi-directional inverter system that converts solar energy for storage, and from storage to useable current.
But this potential trend, he explains, also has its subtleties in that many energy storage systems have a built-in inverter therefore discounting the need for an extra inverter purchase, and that consumers of solar systems today are taking advantage of new battery-ready inverters, in anticipation of installing a battery sometime in the future.

IHS Markit’s He adds that inverter manufacturers are “seeing the potential” in growing C&I demand for larger rooftop systems, “and diversifying their product portfolios.” That is, “some suppliers known for their central inverters, or for catering to utility-scale projects are now releasing smaller string inverters for C&I’s upscaled rooftop installations; and suppliers of microinverters that were specified for the residential segment are now releasing larger multi-module micro inverters suited to the commercial market.”

China’s previously mentioned County Rooftop PV Development Pilot Program, she says, is of a scale large enough to have inspired some central inverter manufacturers to amplify their string section.
The global C&I rooftop solar segment still has its challenges, such as system ownership, maintenance responsibilities and distribution of benefits between building owners and tenants, but as countries push to decarbonize, they will strive to make the economics stack up for this energy-hungry sector.

Ernst & Young (EY) has released a report detailing transactions in power and utilities (P&U) for Q1 2022, with data showing that the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has shifted the energy landscape significantly. Investments in non-Russian natural gas are rising and there is a renewed focus on energy supply security.
According to EY Strategy and Transactions Partner, Miles Huq, the proposed REPowerEU plan to reduce the EU’s dependence on Russian gas imports by two-thirds within a year and phase them out altogether “well before” the end of the decade will require the region to invest significantly in import capacity and pipeline infrastructure. With these plans in mind, the US liquid natural gas market has skyrocketed in anticipation.
In the Americas, 33 deals were completed in the first quarter of 2022, with a cumulative deal value of $15.5 billion. The deal value across both continents was primarily driven by the United States, as it typically is, with deal value totaling up to $13.2 billion, representing 85% of the total deal value across both continents. The deal making activity in the United States was the highest across the past nine quarters, driven primarily by two major multibillion-dollar deals in the gas utility and renewables segment.
The two deals referenced are Infrastructure Investments Fund’s agreement to acquire South Jersey Industries, Inc., a gas utility for $7.6 billion on Feb. 24, and Blackstone Infrastructure Partners’ $3 billion equity investment in Invenergy Renewables on Jan. 7. At the time on the investment, Blackstone shared that the capital would enable Invenergy to accelerate development on its 3 GW pipeline of solar and wind projects expected to be completed by the end of 2023.
The report also highlighted a number of important transactions in the renewables space, with the Americas as a while witnessing $6 billion in transactions across 20 deals in the quarter. Among these important transactions was Royal Dutch Shell’s $775 million in equity capital investment into southern-based solar developer, Silicon Ranch.
Shell invested in Silicon Ranch in 2018 and owns about 45% of the company, and the funding provided by that January 6 deal is expected to enable Silicon Ranch to build about 2 GW of solar projects by January 2025, doubling its current built capacity. Shell also shared that Silicon Ranch could be in the business of acquisition making, like its 2021 purchase of Clearloop, a company that sells carbon offsets to corporations to fund solar projects in low-income communities.
The report also highlights Montreal-based independent fund manager Axium Infrastructure’s acquisition of a 49% equity interest in a 1,415 MW portfolio of wind and solar farms in the US. The projects, all of which have already entered operation, were developed by Constellation Renewables, which retains the remaining 51% stake. The 49% stake was sold to Axium by Canada’s Manulife Investment Management, acting on behalf of John Hancock Infrastructure Fund and its affiliates.
The report also covers Brookfield Renewables’ purchase of utility scale-solar and energy storage developer, Urban Grid, and its pipeline of development-stage projects for $650 million in January. That pipeline is comprised of 1 GW of solar assets and 7 GW of battery assets, both standalone and co-located with solar. Brookfield shared that the acquisition would bring its development pipeline to roughly 31 GW, effectively tripling it.
Finally, the report also brings up the Jan. 19 announcement from 8minute Solar Energy that it closed $400 million in financing from EIG, a leading institutional investor in the global energy and infrastructure sectors. According to 8minute, the funds will help the company to continue to operate and grow its portfolio of clean energy assets, which includes more than 18 GW of solar and 24 GWh of storage throughout California, Texas, and the southwestern United States. The investment will also will enable 8minute to focus on technology innovation and advanced solar plant design, and to begin building projects on its own balance sheet, two important developments.

Australian battery supplier Redflow is moving forward with its planned US expansion strategy, announcing after extensive testing that its zinc-bromine flow battery energy storage solution can now be integrated with hybrid inverters produced by Texas-based storage technology specialist Sol-Ark.
Redflow CEO Tim Harris said the company’s ZBM3 battery zinc-bromine flow battery is now certified to be integrated with Sol-Ark’s North American code-approved products. Harris said the development is an important step in the execution of the company’s plans to expand into the US market, which he described as one of the biggest markets for storage in the world.
“Integration with Sol-Ark’s well-established product line enables Redflow to deploy its zinc-bromine flow batteries in the United States SME (small to medium-sized enterprise) and C&I (commercial and industrial) markets,” he said, adding that the collaboration would create “exciting opportunities” for Redflow and Sol-Ark to work together to deploy new smaller scale systems across the United States.
The announcement comes just months after US non-profit standards development organization Underwriters Laboratories revealed that it would include Redflow batteries in a test program to study the key technical attributes of redox flow batteries under nominal and off-nominal conditions. The research aims to enhance the knowledge base around the operating and safety characteristics of zinc-bromine flow batteries, enabling interested parties to better understand and compare a broad range of product chemistries.
Months earlier, Redflow had signed a deal with tech company Anaergia to supply a 2 MWh energy storage system, featuring 192 zinc-bromine flow batteries, for Anaergia’s bioenergy facility in California.
Redflow’s 10 kWh 48 V ZBM3 ZBM3 battery is the world’s smallest commercially available zinc-bromine flow battery. Its modular, scalable design makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from small commercial installations to multi-megawatt hour storage systems.
Sol-Ark CEO Tom Brennan welcomed the successful completion of integration testing. He said the flow batteries have an important role to play in the future energy storage eco-system.
“From small to large commercial installations, our innovative product range is the enabler of scalable and sustainable renewable energy deployments in this rapidly growing market,” he said.

Two agrivoltaic installations in New South Wales, Australia, are being credited with increasing the quantity and quality of fleece in sheep grazing during droughts. Research shows that the partial shade offered by solar panels creates a microclimate that reduces evaporation and significantly boosts the production of vegetation in arid climates.
While the results are preliminary and anecdotal, they offer potentially exciting field results that could be applied globally. Graeme Ostini, a wool broker, says he’s been grazing his merino wethers (a variety of sheep) at a solar farm where sheep can graze under the modules. Ostini and other grazers say that over the past few years, these sheep have been “cutting an amazing amount of wool.”
The higher quantities of grass available for grazing are not surprising. Dr. Elnaz Hassapour Adeh, a researcher at Oregon State’s College of Agricultural Sciences, found that several key grazing grasses were able to significantly increase their output mostly due to significantly increased water efficiency – by 328%.
In total, the researchers found that areas that were partially or fully covered by solar panels increased their biomass production by 90%.
