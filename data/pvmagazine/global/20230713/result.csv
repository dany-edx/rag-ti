https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/13/new-system-design-for-pvt-systems-coupled-with-air-to-water-reversible-heat-pump/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 13, 2023",New system design for PVT systems coupled with air-to-water reversible heat pump,"Researchers at the University of Zaragoza in Spain have proposed a new design for energy systems based on photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) panels integrated with an air-to-water heat pump via thermal storage tanks.
The system is intended to provide space heating, cooling, domestic hot water (DHW), and electricity to industrial buildings.
“The space heating/cooling distribution circuit uses fan coils as terminal units, allowing a minimum supply temperature of 35 C in winter and 7 C in summer,” they said, describing the operational mode of the system. “To increase the use of low-temperature heat, DHW is supplied at 50 C instead of 60 C, performing periodic heat treatments at 60 C to avoid legionellosis according to sanitary regulations.”
The scientists tested the proposed system design over a 5-month period in a real system deployed at an industrial facility owned by Spanish PVT specialist Endef in Zaragoza. The hybrid pilot plant consists of eight PVT modules with a combined capacity of 2.6 kW covering a surface of 13.6 m2, two water storage tanks with a capacity of 350 l for DHW and 263 l for space heating and cooling, as well as a Yutaki S6 reversible air-to-water heat pump provided by Japanese manufacturer Hitachi.
The heat pump has a nominal capacity of 16 kW in heating mode and of 10.5 kW in cooling mode. Its nominal coefficient of performance (COP) in heating mode is 4.57 and in cooling mode is 3.31. The DHW water tank uses two internal heat exchangers, one for the solar circuit and the other one for the heat pump. The system can provide from 20 C to 60 C in heating mode, from 30 C to 60 C for DHW production, and from 5 C to 22 C in cooling mode.
The research team utilized temperature sensors and flow meters to monitor the thermal performance of the system and a DC/AC inverter to analyze that of the PV power generation unit. “Real weather data monitored in the pilot plant is integrated in the model. The transient model is run with a 5-min time-step, and the results shown in this work are averaged every hour to smooth out the results, as otherwise fluctuations obscure the graphical interpretation and comparison of results,” it further explained. “Weekly energy results are also calculated, by integration, to compare weekly performance indicators.”
Through this analysis, the academics found that the system is potentially “overall self-sufficient” to satisfy the building energy demand. They also ascertained that the pilot plant shows negligible deviation from the simulated setting. “The results show that the heat pump COP estimated in the transient model is similar to the one obtained in the pilot plant, with an average error of -10%,” they further explained.
The proposed system is presented in the paper “Experimental validation of a solar system based on hybrid photovoltaic-thermal collectors and a reversible heat pump for the energy provision in non-residential buildings,” published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/13/how-to-maximize-power-generation-in-pv-blinds/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 13, 2023",How to maximize power generation in PV blinds,"Scientists at the Hanbat National University in South Korea investigated how the performance of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) blinds is affected by the shade produced by the blind slats themselves and have found that a tilt angle of 90 degrees may strongly reduce this effect.
“What distinguishes this research is its emphasis on shading effects in the context of PV blinds, a factor often overlooked,” the research's corresponding author, Jongho Yoon, told pv magazine. “Despite the general praise for PV blinds' ability to potentially generate more power than fixed PV modules due to their adjustable angles, the study draws attention to the substantial operational performance reduction that can occur due to shading effects between, above, and below blind slats.”
The researchers compared the performance of a PV blind with a fixed angle operating under vertical and inclined conditions under vertical and inclined conditions to the performance of a fixed angle reference BIPV module. They used both an experimental field facility and a simulation model to represent real-world scenarios.
“To measure the irradiation delivered to the installed module, three pyranometers were installed on 30 degrees, 90 degrees, and 0 degrees for inclined, vertical, and horizontal planes, respectively,” the scientists specified.
The researchers discovered that except for a 90-degree angle setting, the PV blinds persistently generated less power yield than the reference module at alternate angles. Normally, the optimal angle for PV systems in Korea is 30 degrees.
“Intriguingly, the PV blinds produced peak power at this 30 degrees angle, but a significant discrepancy in power yield compared to the reference module was also noted,” Yoon explained. “This indicates that an elevated power yield produces more pronounced self-shading effects in PV blinds.”
The scientists compared the power yield of PV blinds at their monthly optimal angles with the fixed reference module set at 30 degrees or 90 degrees. The PV blinds outperformed the reference module fixed at a 90-degree angle, yet their power yield was 13 to 21% less than at a 30-degree angle.
“These findings suggest that adjusting the angle of PV blinds could enhance power generation efficiency, albeit limitations existed due to the self-shading effects instigated by the upper slat module,” the scientists emphasized.
The research group also examined scenarios wherein users might incorrectly set the angle of PV blinds. They compared the power yield of PV blinds set at their least optimal angles each month with the reference slat module fixed at either 30 degrees or 90 degrees. It found pronounced differences in power generation performance. The reference module at 30 degrees yielded 83-86% more power than the misaligned PV blinds, whereas it generated 14-28% less power yield than the reference module fixed at 90 degrees.
“This underlined the importance of accurately setting the angle of PV blinds to maximize power generation,” the academics stated.
They presented the new concept in the study “Power performance assessment of PV blinds system considering self-shading effects,” published in Solar Energy.
“It's important to note that the results did not consider the effects of series-parallel connections between slat modules and bypass diodes,” Yoon said referring to the future directions of the research. “Therefore, incorporating these factors under real-world conditions may potentially decrease the power generation efficiency of PV blinds.”

The minigrid systems have a combined capacity of 296 MW of solar, with energy storage in lithium-ion batteries of 719 MWh. The project will be implemented over a period of 36 months.
MCA will  manage and build the project. The financing of €1.29 billion is supported by German Export Credit Agency Euler Hermes.
“Depending on the level of consumption for the 48 sites we estimate an LCOE ranging between €0.153/KWh to €0.275/KWh for all the systems,” a spokesperson from MCA told pv magazine. “This considers not only the PV Generation but also the storage capacity for all 48 sites. As far as the cost for consumers per KWh is concerned, Angolan tariff regulation mandatorily applies. Depending on the type of consumer, a given price per kWh will be charged there are subsidies to electricity prices in Angola.”
In early June, the Export-Import Bank of the United States awarded a loan to Angola’s Ministry of Energy and Water to deploy two large-scale solar power plants, totaling 500 MW.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Angola had 297 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2022. By 2025, the African nation aims to reach an access rate of 65% and a total installed capacity of approximately 10 GW. However, its current installed capacity is only 5.6 GW, with just 4.5 GW actually available.

India needs to add 32 GW of solar capacity per year to meet the targeted share in its revised optimal energy mix for FY 2029-30, according to a new report by SBICAPS.
The revised optimal energy mix, laid out by the Central Electricity Authority, says India’s total installed power generation capacity will increase to 777 GW by fiscal 2029-30, with solar accounting for 293 GW. 
The report said that India’s installed solar PV capacity had reached 68 GW as of May 31, 2023, with around 12.8 GW added in FY 2022-23.
“The National Electricity Plan (NEP) envisions energy demand in India to grow annually at 7% from FY 2021-22 to FY 2026-27,” said the report. “To meet this in a clean way, the revised version of the optimal energy mix posits an increased role for solar energy … We estimate that the pace of solar addition shall have to nearly double to over 30 GW/year to meet this target … this means adding way more than 93 GW which were bid out till FY 2021-22. As of now, 130 GW to 140 GW are planned to be added during the period FY 2023-24 to FY 2027-28.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/13/us-customs-solar-exclusions-might-be-de-facto-ban-on-chinese-polysilicon/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 13, 2023",US Customs solar exclusions might be ‘de facto ban on Chinese polysilicon’,"From pv magazine USA
Under the enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), US Customs and Border Protection has reportedly excluded Longi solar modules made with Tongwei polysilicon from entering the US market, according to a recent industry note from Roth Capital Partners.  
Modules made with Astronergy (Chint) polysilicon have been detained and are under review under the UFLPA, according to additional checks by pv magazine USA. The UFLPA places the burden of proof on importers to show that the supply chain is free from forced labor practices. China has consistently denied allegations of forced labor of the Uyghur minority group.
Prior to the exclusion of these goods, any imports sourced frm Xinjiang region of China, responsible for a little less than 50% of global production, would be barred from entry. However, it was unclear whether other Chinese suppliers outside the region would face similar scrutiny and market bans.
The ban of Tongwei polysilicon-supplied Longi panels could mean a “de facto ban on Chinese polysilicon,” warned a pv magazine USA industry contact. Tongwei was the world’s largest polysilicon provider in 2022, producing over 345,000 (metric tons) MT, and has no presence in the Xinjiang region.
This is a dramatic negative development for the supply of solar panels in the United States, as China produces “a share of 89% in the global output of solar-grade polysilicon in 2022, and expansion continues unabated,” according to Bernreuter Research. Longi is expected to appeal the import exclusion, but the process for appeal may take several months, drying up module supply in the meantime.
To comply with the UFLPA, companies must provide a comprehensive supply chain mapping, a complete list of all workers at a facility, and proof that workers were not subject to conditions typical of forced labor practices and are there voluntarily.
While the United States starts to onshore its solar supply chain, doubts persist that the industry can move fast enough to manufacture a steady supply of components to build toward its clean energy goals. Wood Mackenzie expects the US solar market to triple in size over the next five years, bringing total installed solar capacity to 378 GW by 2028.
Clean Energy Associates (CEA) says that while module assembly has a strong presence today in the United States, ingot, wafer, and cell production plans have not kept pace, and no plans for greenfield polysilicon plants have materialized.
CEA forecasts the United States to reach 17 GW of polysilicon production, 3 GW of ingots, 3 GW of wafers, 18 GW of cell manufacturing, and 40 GW of module manufacturing capacity by 2027, suggesting that the United States will continue to rely on energy imports for years to come. However, the recent UFLPA enforcement developments could pose a serious challenge to finding suppliers.

Liander reported an increase in curtailment events from 1,074 in the first half of 2022 to 3,476 in the same period this year, with Gelderland and Noord-Holland being the most affected regions. Liander said it expects curtailment to rise further as more PV systems are installed, particularly with the phase-out of the net-metering scheme in 2025.
To alleviate grid pressure, Liander recommended residential prosumers to use high-energy appliances during peak hours when solar power is readily available.
In 2022, the Netherlands added approximately 2 GW of new residential solar capacity, and the growing grid constraints pose challenges for the increasing capacity of solar installations in the coming years.
Liander has implemented various measures to address grid constraints, including the deployment of large transformers and congestion management strategies.
A new report by Netbeheer Nederland projects that the Netherlands could achieve a total installed solar capacity of 100 GW to 180 GW by 2050, with residential PV contributing 55% of the maximum peak on the grid by 2040.
As of June 2022, the Netherlands had a cumulative installed PV capacity of 16.5 GW, with 3,803 MW installed in 2021 and 3,882 MW installed in 2022, according to CBS, the nation's statistics agency.
