It was designed, built and tested it in collaboration with Filton Systems Engineering, under the UK-funded Safe Flight project. The project looked at the feasibility of liquid hydrogen fuel as a source to improve UAS search and rescue. “The team have demonstrated fueling and storage of liquid hydrogen, conditioning and distribution of cryogenic gas, and the use of PEM fuel cells to generate electrical power,” said Max Brown, VP of technology at GKN. The project supplied the fuel cell power system with hydrogen at the required temperature and pressure over a range of electrical loads typical of a UAS search-and-rescue mission.
Germany plans to provide €550 million to support hydrogen projects throughout the world, via two new hydrogen funds. The €250 million Ptx Development Fund will promote hydrogen investments in developing and emerging countries, while the €300 million PtX Growth Fund will support infrastructure and accelerate the global market ramp-up of green hydrogen. “The new green hydrogen economy must be fairer than the old fossil economy,” said German Development Minister Svenja Schulze at COP27. “This means that developing countries must also benefit from the value chains of the future.”
Tree Energy Solutions (TES) and the Swiss Association of Waste-to-Energy Plant Operators (VBSA) have partnered to decarbonize 29 waste-to-energy plants in Switzerland. “The scope of the partnership will be to establish how much CO2 should be removed from Switzerland and over what period of time, so that these quantities can be taken into account when dimensioning the transport network in Germany as well as any connecting routes,” said the two companies. TES is working to combine hydrogen and CO2 to deliver “renewable and affordable eNG (green gas),” with a focus on Germany. 
First Hydrogen announced that its first zero-emission light commercial vehicles (LCVs) would shortly undergo test runs near Birmingham, United Kingdom. “This week, the first of the company’s demonstrator vehicles has completed hydrogen fuelling at 700 bar pressure at the ITM/Motive site in Rainham, Essex,” wrote the company.
SunHydrogen has invested $10 million in TECO 2030, and will take one board position with the Norwegian technology developer. “As part of the investment, the two parties agree to further regulate their joint intention to pursue a potential business combination through which an up-listing of the investor on a US exchange will be explored,” said US-based SunHydrogen.

The country received a score of 62.9, followed by China and the United States, with scores of 61.1 and 58.5, respectively.
Australia, Israel, Germany, Egypt, France, Brazil and Morocco completed EY’s top 10. For overall renewables investment, the United States ranked first, followed by China, and then Germany, which moved up one spot from last year.
“The US retains its top position due to the Inflation Reduction Act passed in August 2022, which is viewed as a game changer for its green hydrogen industry,” the report says.
China is expected to add 100 GW of solar this year, according to the China Renewable Energy Engineering Institute. Germany’s rise to third place was reportedly bolstered by its Easter package commitment to renewables. The United Kingdom lost its spot in the top three, taking fourth place. France, Australia, India, Spain, Japan and the Netherlands rounded out the top 10.
The report also ranks markets in terms of the attractiveness of renewable power procurement via offsite corporate PPAs.
“The volume of power generation committed through PPAs in 2022 is set to be less than 2021, although higher than 2020,” the report says, noting that this will be the first year-on-year reduction in signed corporate PPAs since 2013.
Key factors in the reduction include uncertainty around government policy and rapidly changing cost profiles, according to EY. Spain remained the most attractive PPA market in 2022, with Germany overtaking the United States for second place. The United Kingdom, Australia and France completed the top five.
EY also introduced a new renewables attractiveness ranking, normalized to countries’ gross domestic product. It highlighted Morocco, Chile and Portugal as markets performing above expectations for their economic size.

Representatives from the governments of Argentina and Chile, together with Chilean utility AES Andes, have announced a bidirectional energy exchange deal via the Andes Interconnection Line.
The 345 kV transmission line extends 409 kilometers between the Andes substation, in the Chilean region of Antofagasta, and the Cobos substation, in the Argentine province of Salta. During the day, Argentina will receive 80 MW of solar energy from Chile. During the night, it will export 200 MW of natural gas back to Chile.
According to the executive vice-president and COO of AES, Bernerd Da Santos, the agreement will displace diesel generation in Chile during the night, in addition to reducing costs and emissions. During the day, the Chilean electricity grid will be under less pressure from renewables injection.
The Andes Interconnection Line has existed since 2000 and has now been reconnected. It was initially only used to send energy from Argentina to Chile.
The deal aims to address the curtailment of renewable energy in Chile, according to the country’s minister of energy, Diego Pardow. Chile will curtail around 1 TW of renewable energy this year, said Pardow.

“Key Energy shows closed their doors today at Rimini Expo Centre with plus-41% in total attendance compared to 2021 (and plus-15% over the record edition of 2019), also recording double foreign attendance (from 90 countries),” the company said, without providing more specific figures.
Italian companies and international solar players are showing greater confidence in the Italian PV market, which is set to regain its gigawatt-size market status, following several years of limited growth.
“This year, for the first time, there was a new breath of optimism and dynamism,” said Michelangelo Lafronza, the secretary of ANIE Rinnovabili, the Italian renewable energy association. “We believe that the situation we are experiencing throughout Europe has brought renewables into the limelight. The need to reduce energy costs is combined with the need to protect the environment.”
He said that agrivoltaics are becoming a key market driver in the Italian energy landscape.
“According to new data from the Ministry of the Ecological Transition, there are currently 338 agrivoltaic projects totaling 15 GW that are currently under review to secure an environmental impact assessment,” he told pv magazine. “This compares to 140 projects for ground-mounted installations totaling 5.1 GW.”
Lafronza noted that Italian grid operator Terna and the energy regulator, Arera, are currently setting up a new auction scheme for large-scale storage facilities.
“Although is it still unclear if the operators participating to the auctions will also be remunerated for grid services or not, the scheme is raising big expectations in the sector and should trigger more growth,” he said.
He noted that 38 of the 578 projects include storage capacity, for a total of 1,250 GW.
“A regulatory and regulatory framework is finally being created in which there will actually be several tens of GWh of storage systems to be built,” said Daniele Rosati, coordinator of the Utility Scale Storage Systems Group of ANIE Federazione. “This news, together with the presence at the conference of many Italian and foreign sector operators, confirms that Italy is shaping up as one of the most important markets for storage systems worldwide for the next decade:”
Market outlook
The president of Italian association Italia Solare, Paolo Rocco Viscontini, said Key Energy faithfully reflects the current status of the Italian market.
“Solar demand is increasing considerably compared to previous years,” he said. “The main driver remains the current high energy prices.”
Viscontini said he expects around 2 GW of new PV capacity this year.
“But if we will have the typical end of year's peak, we may also have several hundreds of more megawatts,” he said. “Furthermore, from what we heard at the fair, 2023 could be even better, with more than 4 GW of newly installed PV capacity.”
The latest edition of pv magazine considers the impact the Inflation Reduction Act will have on US solar and ponders where the resultant manufacturing sites will land. The situation is just the opposite in Germany, we discover, with PV investors piling up but few suitable sites left for solar farms. We also anticipate shortages in raw materials to drive the electric vehicle revolution, and the measures battery makers are taking to secure supply, and we ponder the effect the rise of TOPCon solar will have on the supply of its preferred encapsulant resin.
He said the main market drivers will be the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment, which offers a quick and effective solution to increasing or volatile electricity prices, and the large-scale segment, which is expected to see more growth, despite current regulatory barriers.
In light of this growth, IEG has taken the strategic decision to separate the Key Energy event from the broader framework of the Ecomondo circular-economy event.
“Key Energy has matured so much that it is ready to stand on its own two feet,” said Corrado Arturo Peraboni, CEO of IEG. “After 15 editions running alongside Ecomondo, the event will have its own space and will be held in spring with a new format that will, in any case, leverage on the lengthy experience in the sector gained in over a decade of activity. Our goal is to give the new K.EY an increasingly international scope, transforming it into the most important community dedicated to renewables and energy transition in the Mediterranean basin area, thus strengthening our leadership in Europe.”
The next event will simply be called “K.ey” and will be held in Rimini in March.
“For the March 2023 edition, the exhibition area is expected to double with a 30% increase in the number of exhibitor brands present and more than double the number of attendees,” the organizer said, noting that it will also include a Solar Exhibition and Conference for the first time. “The third edition of ForumTech, Italia Solare´s training and information event, will also take place at the same time.”

The round, 95 W solar module has an efficiency of up to 18.5%. It features 35 cells from Singapore-based solar manufacturer Maxeon.
The panel is based on a colorful cell technology that the manufacturer has dubbed “Color, Form, Reflection (CRF).” It claims the panel can be applied to almost any surface. It hides the solar cells with a colored compound that sticks to the glass. This compound has many colors, arranged to form a picture of Earth that was originally taken from the Apollo 11 space mission.
“The solar cells are covered by the picture and still produce enough energy to charge a battery during the daylight,” the BIPV specialist's chief financial officer, Martín Rivadeneira, told pv magazine.
In the dark, the signboard is illuminated by a 760-lumen LED light powered by its own solar energy. The company has a range of solar tiles in its portfolio for residential applications, architectural projects, churches, and building facades. However, the compound hiding the cells only has one color, unlike the PV signboard.
Dansk Solenergi developed the PV signboard in collaboration with Danish artist Bo Karberg in Holeby, a municipality on the island of Lolland, southern Denmark.

The panel is based on its TOPCon mono cell technology, which achieved a record efficiency of 26.1% in mid-October. The results, which were confirmed by Germany's TÜV Rheinland, builds on the company's previous record of 23.53%, set in July.
“The module adopted JinkoSolar's latest TOPCon cell technology and advanced welding and packaging technology and achieved conversion efficiency of 23.86%,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The advanced welding and packaging technology effectively reduces the internal resistance loss of the module, while significantly improving conversion efficiency. In addition, this lab result has the practical foundation to be introduced into mass production, and technically set the direction for mass production of subsequent advanced products.”
In January 2020, Jinko said it managed to improve panel performance by applying a new anti-reflection coating and advanced metallization technologies. It also incorporated New Tiling Ribbon (TR) technology into the cell design, to eliminate inter-cell gaps. At the time, the panel power conversion efficiency was 22.39%.
Its new solar module features solar cells with a 267.72 cm2 monocrystalline silicon substrate, grown using the Czochralski method.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/15/roadmap-to-increase-solar-acceptance/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 15, 2022",Roadmap to increase solar acceptance,"Due to the nature of the energy transformation, the acceptance of change is an essential element for the success of this revolution. The number of jobs involved, the impact on the environment, and the social aspects related to the development of PV are increasingly scrutinized. Social acceptance is fueled by a positive perception of the changes.
In the case of PV, in contrast to other renewable sources, the initial perception of PV was positive. Most countries started by developing small-scale PV installations, mostly on roofs, and until 2006-07, the general perception of PV was positive, as its impact was marginal. PV represented only a small fraction of the energy produced and the question of acceptance was still largely irrelevant.
The first stakeholders to raise questions were grid operators looking at specific costs and the prospect of decreased revenues. Several US states – but also Germany, France and Belgium, among others – experienced questioning of, or in the worst case direct opposition to, distributed PV development. The opposition of conventional electricity producers added rapidly to the equation. In many European countries, incumbent utilities lobbied substantially to reduce the deployment of PV, very often through negative campaigns that left traces in public opinion.
The first major drawback came from the massive market take-off in Spain in 2007-08, when the high popularity of the local feed-in tariff caused PV to develop so fast that the authorities stopped the tariff, in fear of economic and budget consequences for the country. In the countries that experienced a major market development followed by a rapid halt – such as Spain, France, Belgium, Czech Republic, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania, to mention a few (the EU was the epicenter of PV development until 2011-12) – the positive image of PV soon became polluted by the perception of extravagant profits, dramatic impacts on electricity prices, or quality issues. The opposition imposed drastic cuts to PV plants, after having largely swayed public opinion to the view that PV developers were abusing taxpayers’ money. PV development was severely curtailed in these countries during the decade prior to 2020, with social acceptance at dramatically low levels.
Over the years, the PV development paradigm has changed along with the perception of PV electricity. About 945.7 GW of PV power plants were producing electricity throughout the world at the end of the 2021, with around 70% installed during the last five years. An increasing number of markets have started contributing to global PV installations, and 2021 closed with a record number of new countries installing significant numbers of PV all around the world.
The rapid decline in PV prices over the past few years, despite the conjectural recent price increase, has enabled PV systems to achieve competitive prices in several countries. The possibility of developing PV systems with limited or no financial incentives is now an observable reality.
PV is now a major contributor in all the scenarios and perspectives for energy production at national and international levels. In a 2020 survey by IFOP, 84% of French people said they felt that PV was a clean, environmentally friendly energy source. With this broader integration, if electricity prices should remain at the high level experienced in 2022 in several places around the world in 2022, especially in Europe, the question of competitiveness and social acceptance would be completely redefined.
The strongest opposition is now generally related to utility-scale PV plants and land consumption. Environmental groups question or oppose PV development on the basis of risks for biodiversity and the artificialization of land. The question of aesthetics is increasingly asked, especially in areas with a recreative value. In recent years, bans have been seen in Europe against PV on agricultural land, leaving few options for ground-mounted PV outside of former industrial zones. The shift toward agrivoltaics that we see now is an attempt to solve the competition for land with the dual use: energy and food production, but the opposition remains active.
Finally, the growth of PV is bringing PV into the political arena. General social acceptance has rebounded to a high level, but the economic equation of PV threatens the revenues of several stakeholders, which respond by campaigning heavily against PV development. The limited industrial job creation outside of Asia did not support accelerated PV development. In multiple countries (Turkey, Morocco, India), policies put a hold on PV development until it was coupled with local value creation. In France, indirect local content requirements have been introduced in tenders. Higher acceptance levels could be achieved by demonstrating the added value of PV in terms of job creation, revenue generation, economic and activity development, which could positively influence regions with industrial decline. The recent levels of support for the PV industry seen in Europe, India and the United States demonstrate this trend.
Community acceptance is related to the acceptance by local stakeholders. It includes concerns over distributional justice (the fair sharing of costs and benefits) and trust. Higher acceptance levels could be achieved by transferring value, part of the decision process or at least discussions to the citizens and local stakeholders at large. In general, the target is to overcome ignorance and misconception (for example, about the land that is actually needed to meet the targets). In Spain, some distributed PV can participate in tenders if they respect certain conditions of local partnerships and consumption centres proximity. In France, self-consumption is gaining momentum these two last years, indeed consumers are becoming prosumers which improves solar’s image. Similarly, the trend of energy communities and the Community Solar initiative in the United States enable the fight against poverty and energy vulnerability.
Although challenges related to the acceptance of PV are directly influenced by the political, economic, geographical, social context in which PV installations are being deployed, they are fairly similar across different regions and countries. This calls for a higher collaboration between countries on this topic based on the sharing of experience and exchange of good practices. The challenge of social acceptance about finding policies to harness the following positive aspects of the energy transition:
This is the first article for a new monthly column by the IEA-PVPS program. This article was contributed by IEA PVPS Task 1 – Strategic PV Analysis and Outreach. Further information on social acceptance of PV can be found in Task 1’s recent Trends in PV Applications 2022 report.

“The plant is to be built in the Baltic Sea on Bornholm, close to all the planned wind turbine parks,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The facility, however, will not be connected directly to a renewable energy source, it will be connected to the normal electric grid. We will store cheap ‘excess' electricity and that will mostly be from renewable sources – and as our national grid is going towards 100 % renewables, our plant will be powered more and more by renewables.”
The storage facility is scheduled for completion in 2024 and will have a capacity of 1 MW/20 MWh. It will provide heat, power, and ancillary services to the local network.
“After the completion of the plant, Hyme will be ready for commercial deployment of plants of up to 1 GWh or more,” said Hyem.
The company's storage technology uses renewable energy to heat the salt using electrical heaters. It is based on two-tank molten salt storage designs developed for concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. It said it has a scalable storage capacity from 250 MWh to 5 GWh. A 1 GWh facility with sodium hydroxides should be able to store heat to produce power and heat for around 100,000 households for 10 hours of discharge.
The two tanks are able to store electricity as heat at 700 C. The high temperature provides large flexibility for how energy can be extracted back out, including Rankine cycle combined heat-and-power production, Brayton cycle heat-to-power, heat storage for district heating, and industrial process heat. The technology also uses immersion heaters to store excess electricity as heat, while pumps control the flow for discharging through salt to steam heat exchangers for producing steam to drive steam turbines for co-generation in the simplest setup.
Seaborg Technologies, which makes molten salt nuclear reactors, said the storage system could have a maximum heat loss of 0.5% to 1% per day. Costs should be between 30% and 50% lower than conventional molten salt storage. Hyme said it believes it could halve the price of long-term and large-scale energy storage facilities, regardless of geographical location.

Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) is teaming up with Windlab to develop the North Queensland Super Hub, which will unlock more than 10 GW of wind and solar energy in Australia over the next 10 years, to support large-scale green hydrogen production.
Canberra-based Windlab, which is partly owned by FFI founder Andrew Forrest’s Squadron Energy, said the Super Hub will include a number of individual utility-scale projects, with development progressing on multiple projects in parallel. The first projects announced for the Super Hub include the 800 MW Prairie Wind Farm and the 1 GW Wongalee wind project. Upon completion, the entire hub is expected to host a staggering 10 GW of clean energy capacity.
Windlab said the first stage of the proposed project is currently in detailed planning, with land agreements in place and the application for development approval for the Prairie Wind Farm planned for submission in the coming months. Subject to approvals, construction on the first-stage projects is expected to commence in 2025, with the projects anticipated to begin producing power by 2027.
FFI has repeatedly declared plans to build a global portfolio of renewable projects to produce 15 million tons per year of green hydrogen by 2030 – rising to 50 million tons per year in the decade thereafter. It said energy generated from the Super Hub will be used to produce green hydrogen and feed renewable power to the grid.
FFI Chief Executive Officer Mark Hutchinson said the opportunity is a “game changer” for Queensland that will accelerate the decarbonization of the grid and help to make green hydrogen a reality at an industrial scale.
“Australia’s natural resources, including its wind, sun and landmass, are unrivalled in terms of their potential for the production of green energy – green hydrogen in particular – and that is no truer than in the sunshine state,” he said. “This is about ensuring Queensland and Australia are in the best possible position to play a leading role in the production and supply of green hydrogen globally.”
Green hydrogen has been highlighted as a solution for decarbonization across a range of sectors, including, transport, industrial and energy storage. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has forecast that demand for hydrogen exported from Australia could be over 3 million tons per year by 2040, injecting up to AUD 10 billion ($6.7 billion) into the economy every year.
However, industrial-scale green hydrogen has been constrained by the lack of renewable supply to power the process of extracting hydrogen from water through electrification.
“For the first time, the North Queensland Super Hub will provide the quantity of renewable energy we need to support large-scale green hydrogen production right here in Queensland,” Hutchinson said. “The environmental and economic opportunities that can stem from this are significant, both in terms of lowering emissions and reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and in terms of local job creation.”
John Martin, chief executive of Windlab, said the North Queensland Super Hub presents a high-yield, complementary wind and solar resource in a region ideally suited for multiple offtake opportunities.
“This facility marks a big step toward realizing our strategic, scalable development plan that leverages the region’s untapped renewable energy base to transform Australia’s electricity market and drive the nation’s clean energy transition,” he said.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk welcomed the plans for the Super Hub, saying that it would accelerate the development of Northern Queensland Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) and sit at the heart of the state’s SuperGrid.
“Building the SuperGrid is a key part of the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan, which we released in September this year,” she said. “The plan represents AUD 62 billion of public and private investment in the energy system by 2035. It will create 100,000 jobs by 2040 and guarantee secure jobs for energy workers. And it will help our state to further decarbonize, to reach the ambitious renewable energy targets we’ve set, including 70% renewable energy by 2032.”

The domestic manufacturers withdrew their complaint because price pressures have eased with the imposition of basic customs duties on solar cells and modules. The government imposed a basic customs duty of 40% on solar modules and 25% on cells from April.
“The said levy covering the entire scope of the product under investigation has alleviated the price pressure being suffered by the domestic industry due to the dumping from the subject countries to a considerable extent, though not fully,” said the ISMA.
In May 2021, the DGTR launched an investigation into solar cells from China, Thailand, and Vietnam. The probe was based on an application filed by Mundra Solar PV, Jupiter Solar Power, and Jupiter International. In their application to ISMA, they sought anti-dumping duties to protect them from cheap imports.

The scientists described the novel algorithm as an alternative to standard performance ratio (PR) analysis, which describes the relationship between actual and theoretical energy outputs of a PV plant. They said it uses a PV system's string with maximum output as a reference.
“The output of other strings is set in relation to the corresponding value of the reference string, resulting in a quantity we call self-referencing ratio (SR),” the scientists explained. “We benchmark this ratio against the established performance ratio, which requires solar irradiance data for calculation.”
The group tested the new approach on a 9 MW PV power station in Germany. The facility, which has been operational since 2011, features three-phase inverters deployed across 1,719 strings.
“The three strings belonging to one inverter are installed on one mounting rack, located in three rows,” the scientists said.
They corroborated their testing with IR imaging and a voltage analysis and found that the new algorithm can predict and identify string yield losses or underperforming strings without additional weather data. They claimed their self-referencing method can identify local differences due to plant layout and the aging of components. It can also be used to inspect solar modules, strings, arrays, inverters, and transformers.
“Losses beyond expected degradation can be estimated and function as a basis for O&M decisions,” said the scientists. “We expect further advantages by applying the self-referencing method for degradation studies of time-series and root-cause analysis with machine learning and combination with different data sources, for example, imaging data.”
The academics described the new approach in “Assessment of string performance using self-referencing method in comparison to performance ratio,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
