Maxeon and Samsung have announced plans to integrate their respective smart home energy management solutions, in a move that underscores the rise of heat pump and residential PV integrations. Earlier this week, SMA made a similar announcement, while SolarEdge revealed plans to collaborate with Samsung and Vaillant, a German heat pump manufacturer.
Singapore-based Maxeon will collaborate with Samsung to implement a cloud-to-cloud system. This system will transmit data from Maxeon's PV panels and batteries to Samsung's home platform, enabling the use of surplus PV energy to pre-heat rooms at specific times, among other applications.
“Data about electricity production and system status from relevant Maxeon products in the home… will be shared with [Samsung’s] SmartThings Energy dashboard, providing homeowners with further visualization and control options,” a Maxeon spokesperson told pv magazine. “For example, homeowners can utilize periods of excess solar production to trigger the SmartThings Energy dashboard, which will pre-heat specific rooms in the home through a Samsung heat pump, promoting self-consumption of renewable energy and electricity bill savings.”
The companies will also evaluate future integration opportunities related to electric vehicle chargers, virtual power plant programs, and cross-sales of products such as appliances, displays, and solar systems, said Maxeon.
“Consumers have seen their relationship with energy change rapidly over the past few years and now desire modern solutions that enable them to realize more value from their energy systems,” said Maxeon CEO Bill Mulligan. “The collaboration with Samsung is intended to do just that. It has never been more important for our end-customers to take a more active role in their domestic energy consumption, understand how much money they can save by switching to clean energy sources and how much carbon they can keep from entering the atmosphere.”

Maxeon said it filed the lawsuit with the Dusseldorf district court in Germany. It claims that Tongwei infringed on its European Patent No. EP3522045 B1 for shingled solar cell panel technology. Maxeon uses the tec in its Performance Line solar modules.
“The intellectual property behind our shingled solar cell technology is the outcome of investments and technical advancements, the resultant Performance Line outperforms conventional panels in efficiency, power, and reliability,” said Maxeon CEO Bill Mulligan. “In September 2020, Maxeon filed a lawsuit against Canadian Solar in Japan, which was subsequently settled in April 2022. With this latest filing against Tongwei Solar, Maxeon is continuing to vigorously enforce its valuable intellectual property rights to prohibit unauthorized use.”
The Performance Line PV panel architecture and manufacturing processes were pioneered by Cogenra Solar, a Silicon Valley startup that SunPower acquired in 2015. In the subsequent 2020 spinoff from SunPower, Maxeon retained the intellectual property associated with the solar cell and module technologies, as well as the SunPower brand in the more than 100 markets it serves, according to a company statement.
“We have instructed our local German attorneys to handle the Maxeon matters,” a spokesperson from Tongwei told pv magazine. “As committed, Tongwei fully supports our customers and has an open mind to collaborate with industry partners in developing clean energy for the whole world.”
The Chinese module maker claimed it is currently spending a lot of resources to develop the shingled module technology and production capabilities. “Since Tongwei started R&D on the shingled module technology, we have paid close attention to related patents – making sure we do not infringe other’s patent rights, as well as developing our own IP portfolio,” it explained. “Before we launched new products, systematic FTOs have been repeatedly carried out internally and by external IP firms. We firmly believe that we have differentiated our technology and products from our competitors.”

The scientists used a numerical module and the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells that was developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium, to simulate s solar cell based on a type of lead-halide perovskite known as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3).
“In2S3 is an n-type semiconductor with excellent carrier mobility, nontoxicity, an adequate bandgap, adjustable electrical properties, and good thermal durability, all of which are ideal for utilization as an ETM in solar cells,” it emphasized.
The group designed the cell with a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), the novel ETL, the MAPbI3 absorber, a spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer, and a gold (Au) metal contact. The ideal absorber thickness, according to the simulation, should be 0.7 µm, which would reportedly maximize the photocurrent while minimizing recombination.
The solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 20.15%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.089 V, a short-circuit current of 24.18 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 76.45%. “Overall, the solar cell performed better between 20 C and 30 C, and its efficiency rapidly decreases above that temperature,” the scientists stated.
They introduced the cell technology in the study “Insights into the photovoltaic properties of indium sulfide as an electron transport material in perovskite solar cells,” published in Scientific Reports.”This study paves the way towards practical implementation of indium sulfide as the potential ETL for MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells,” they concluded.
The team comprises researchers from Cornell University in the United States, the University of Warith Al-Anbiyaa in Iraq, the GLA University in India, the INTI International University in Malaysia, Bangladesh's Atomic Energy Research Establishment, and the King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals in Saudi Arabia.

The new S6 model works as an independent power center, targeting businesses in the commercial and industrial sectors that are interconnecting solar PV, generator options, and battery storage, to the grid.
The Solis inverter has four models, allowing for PV input power from 42 kW to 70 kW and a maximum total load of 48 kW, with a maximum input voltage of 1000 V. It is protected by a 10-second, 200% surge overload capability and can tie into lithium-ion and lead acid batteries, with multiple battery protection features and custom charge/discharge time settings. The maximum charging and discharging current is 190A, while automatic UPS switching happens within 10 ms.
The inverter is IP66 protected and weighs a maximum of 78 kg. It allows for feeding excess power back to the grid, along with peak shaving in both self-consumption and generator modes. It has a maximum efficiency of 97.6%, with a European efficiency of 97.0%.
“Solis has launched a new S6 Advanced Power Hybrid Inverter which combines solar generator and battery connectivity to liberate power-starved households and businesses in South Africa from the unpredictability of daily electrical outages,” said James Frank, Solis' country manager for South Africa.
He added that although the solar sector in South Africa is young compared to Europe and the Americas, it is expanding exponentially, noting that Solis is working to equip local installers with information, support, and training on its new inverter.

The “Blade2Sun” solution uses reused blades to support a metal structure that supports bifacial PV modules, bypassing the need for a standard mounting structure with metallic beams.
“The number of modules which can be mounted on a single blade depends on various parameters, such as the blade length, the lateral reinforcement, and the local weather conditions, notably wind and snow,” Noé Tallon, project chief for Planair told pv magazine.
The company installed a prototype at a 2,500-meter altitude site in the Grisons region of Switzerland. It features nine bifacial 430 W solar modules on one blade and another seven panels on the other blade, in rows of three in landscape position.
“There are no lateral reinforcements, as the pilot only uses standard PV-mounting rails commercially available,” said Tallon. “The prototype’s next iterations will use reinforcements to reach a wider span and therefore increase the number of parallel modules on a single blade.”
The wind turbine blades in the pilot installation are 8.4 meters long and weigh 420 kg each.  They are mounted on a 5-meter-high support structure. Tallon said that Turn2Sun aims to install the solar mounting structure as close as possible to repowered wind parks, in order to minimize transportation costs and the total carbon footprint.
“The main cost advantage of this solution is the use of used wind turbine blades which have a raw cost negligible or even negative, making it very competitive compared to heavy metal structures usually used for elevated PV installations and making for a significant fraction of the global costs,” claimed Tallon.
The company said it is developing partnerships with several global players to offer the Blade2Sun solution in countries other than Switzerland. The applications reportedly include carparks, water reservoirs, agrivoltaics installations, and roadside arrays.

Over the winter, for the first time, EU renewables generated more electricity than fossil fuel energy sources, with a 40% share of the energy mix. The high cost of fossil fuel imports and the need for energy independence after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine called for a major change in the EU energy system. One thing is definitely clear: Solar and renewables can power Europe in all seasons. This is only possible with strong and flexible energy infrastructure.
Worryingly, there are increasing reports of solar being curtailed. Czechia had to shut down a number of solar plants in April due to abundantly sunny weather. Similarly, Poland’s grid operator has recently declared an official “threat” to electricity supplies because of a surplus energy issue. All across Europe, developers and system operators are warning that, increasingly, the grid can’t handle the low-cost sustainable energy generated by the solar boom.
Failing to upgrade the grid and maximize flexibility borders on self-sabotage. In an energy and climate crisis, we cannot afford to waste a single electron of renewable electricity in favor of polluting fossil fuels. We need to start taking energy storage seriously, alleviate grid constraints, and get Europe’s electricity networks ready for the solar age.
Flexibility solutions including demand response and energy storage must play an active part in the energy transition. One example is solar with co-located energy storage. Such hybrid systems can play a pivotal role in meeting the flexibility needs of a decarbonized, decentralized energy system. More importantly, these systems have the ability to save every drop of extra energy produced by solar panels to ease the grid during pressure periods.
Ultimately, EU countries need to start fully implementing flexibility solutions such as energy storage to get the grid ready both in the short- and long-term. Despite excellent proposals for regulatory frameworks outlined in 2019, in the “Clean energy for all Europeans” package, little has advanced in Europe until now. Other regions, such as the United States, are forging ahead with flexibility deployment.
Fortunately, positive signs are on the horizon. The EU’s proposal to revise its electricity market design reflects existing potential, with suggested new tools aimed at developing non fossil fuel flexibility solutions including energy storage. These facilities are meant to alleviate pressure on the grid, deliver 24/7 solar, and help energy storage owners see a return on their investment.
SolarPower Europe is a founding partner of the recently launched Energy Storage Coalition, a new organization which is working to ramp up storage capacity across Europe and advance clean energy storage solutions as part of Europe’s overall energy transition. During the coalition’s recent launch event, EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson specifically emphasized that energy storage is key to building a future-proof, resilient, and decarbonized energy system. The solutions are clear: if we want to avoid future grid shutdowns, Europe will have to invest in storage capacity.
We can look to countries such as Greece for inspiration; the Athens government will be spending €341 million ($370 million) scaling up its energy storage capacity. The country has also recently launched a €200 million solar-plus-battery subsidy scheme for small storage systems and solar projects in the agricultural and residential markets.
If there is one thing we can take away from the last year, it is that renewable energy sources including solar are the future. Fossil fuels are a thing of the past. Renewable electricity has already proven that it can fight the energy crisis and we can expect the share of electricity generated by renewable energy to increase year on year.
To guarantee the continent’s energy security, Europe’s energy storage potential needs to be seriously considered and realized. Renewables can fully power Europe with a strong and flexible grid infrastructure. Let’s start future-proofing our grids by investing in energy storage and other flexibility solutions such as demand response, and avoid wasting any more rays of solar.

Serbia has allocated 50 MW for solar PV and 400 MW for wind power in its initial renewable energy auctions. The projects will receive support through a 15-year contract for difference. The upcoming auctions have set ceiling prices of €105 ($113.56)/MWh for wind farms over 3 MW and €90/MWh for solar projects over 500 kW. State-owned utility Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS) will be the exclusive off-taker for these projects. The bidding deadline is Aug. 14, 2023.
This auction marks the first phase of a three-year plan, aiming to allocate premiums for a total of 1,000 MW of wind power generation capacity and 300 MW of solar.
“It is estimated that with the successful implementation of the auctions, the Electric Power Company of Serbia will earn more than €3 million annually, taking into account the relevant market prices,” Serbian Minister of Mining and Energy Dubravka Đedović said in a statement.
The successful bidders will have to adhere to the newly adopted balancing responsibility contract model, requiring them to pay surcharges to EPS for output deviations. Surcharges will be based on day-ahead market prices, according to the government.
The auctions will receive financial support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). In March, the EBRD approved a €300 million financing package for EPS to accelerate wind and solar development and help achieve Serbia's coal phase-out goal by 2050. The bank has been assisting Serbia with renewables auctions since 2020.
Serbia aims to install 8.3 GW of PV by 2024, as outlined in the government's draft plan. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Serbia's installed PV capacity stood at 137 MW by the end of 2022.

French energy giant Engie and Eku Energy, the battery storage platform of Macquarie Group, have commissioned Australia's first big battery in Victoria's Latrobe Valley. The 150 MW/150 MWh battery has been developed and funded through their joint efforts, marking a significant milestone as it operates within a former coal site.
The Hazelwood battery is believed to be Australia’s largest privately funded utility-scale battery to date. Energy Synapse founder Marija Petkovic recently pointed out that the commissioning of Hazelwood brings Australia to its first gigawatt of installed battery storage.
Hazelwood’s battery facility has been supplied, and will be operated and maintained, by US-based Fluence. The project is the first to use Fluence’s Gridstack battery system, which the company says is built for the “most demanding applications” including flexible peaking capacity, and frequency regulation. The facility incorporates 342 modular Fluence Cubes. While the battery currently only has one hour of duration, it is believed the project will eventually grow, in line with a broader trend in Australia for supersized batteries.
“With [the battery’s] access to transmission and available space at site, Hazelwood is the perfect location for an asset that can grow in depth and duration, increasing the hosting capacity for renewables,” said Engie Australian CEO Rik De Buyserie.
The Hazelwood site is reported to have access to 1.6 GW of dormant transmission capacity. The power station was built in the 1960s and closed in 2017. Power prices in Victoria soared as a consequence, and the debacle led to state governments to impose much stricter rules around notice periods of generation retirements.

The China-based module manufacturer made the announcement during Intersolar Europe this week in Munich, Germany.
“Improving cell conversion efficiency and reducing the cost of electricity remain the perpetual theme driving the development of the photovoltaic industry,” said Longi President Li Zhenguo during the announcement speech.
The European Solar Test Installation (ESTI) has certified the results, which represent a 1.7% increase on the previous 31.8% efficiency rating, which was announced during the SNEC conference in late May in Shanghai, China.
The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has ranked Longi's latest efficiency results as the second-highest on record, following King Abdullah University of Science and Technology's (KAUST) achievement of 33.7% efficiency in June. Earlier in April, KAUST reported an efficiency of 33.2% for a perovskite/silicon tandem PV cell.
Longi has broken the world record for solar cell efficiency 14 times since April 2021. It claimed the world’s highest efficiency for silicon cells in November 2022, with a 26.81% efficiency rating for an unspecified heterojunction solar cell.

US-based CubicPV has secured new firm equity commitments in excess of $100 million dollars to support its US factory plans and tandem solar product roadmap.
The first $33 million will be released immediately. The second tranche investment is tied to specific project milestones. The capital was committed by shareholders, led by SCG Cleanergy (a wholly owned subsidiary of SCG) with contributions from Hunt Energy Enterprises and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a set of investment funds founded by Bill Gates.
“With its deep experience in silicon wafer production and ownership of highly innovative proprietary technologies, Cubic is ideally positioned to play a key role in the world’s embrace of solar powered electricity generation,” said Tim McCaffery, global investment director of SCG. “We continued to be impressed with the strength of the team, their progress against plan and their commitment to manufacturing and innovation excellence.”
Late last year, CubicPV announced plans to establish 10 GW of conventional mono wafer capacity in the United States. Driven by incentives in the US Inflation Reduction Act, the wafers produced by the new facility could fill a void in the domestic supply chain as well as create 1,500 new direct jobs.
CubicPV said it continues to make progress in its plan to build U.S. wafer manufacturing capacity, having completed its conceptual design and scoping for the project. The company narrowed its site selection decision to two final possible locations, and engaged with an industry-leading project management company. It also indicated that financing is on track, having received term sheets that indicate that it will exceed the required total equity for the new factory.
“Today’s announcement underscores the considerable progress we’ve made, the depth of our engineering competence and the strength of our technologies to deliver a more powerful solar future,” said Frank van Mierlo, chief executive officer of CubicPV. “We thank SCG Cleanergy for their confidence in our manufacturing goals and product roadmap.

London-based Ernst & Young has once again crowned India as the most attractive destination for PV investment, followed by China and the United States. Germany, Australia, Israel, France, Egypt, Spain, and Brazil, rounded out EY’s top 10 nations for PV investment, in that order.
For overall renewables investment, the United States retained the top position. It had almost 360 GW of solar and 258 GW of standalone battery storage in queues. Germany overtook China, targeting 80% renewables by 2030. India moved up to sixth place, as it aims to become a major producer and exporter of green hydrogen.
India’s renewables industry, especially solar, is rising due to ambitious government targets. The nation targets 500 GW of renewables capacity by 2030, including around 280 GW from solar, and net-zero emissions by 2070. India is also focused on producing five million metric tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030.
The expansion of the green hydrogen industry will drive demand for renewable energy. According to EY, India has the fastest rate of renewable electricity growth among major economies, with renewables accounting for around 42.5% of installed power capacity as of February 2023.
India promotes domestic manufacturing of components like cells and modules to meet its renewable energy goals. It has reached a cell and module manufacturing capacity of around 44 GW per year as of early 2023.
“India is making significant efforts to establish itself as an attractive and investible market for renewable energy,” said Somesh Kumar, EY India power and utilities leader. “The Indian government has been implementing various policies and initiatives to promote renewable energy development and attract both domestic and foreign investments.”
The biannual RECAI ranks the world’s top 40 markets on the attractiveness of their renewable energy investment and deployment opportunities. It considers criteria like the magnitude of the development pipeline, reflecting the absolute size of the renewable investment opportunity. The index is normalized with the gross domestic product to assess markets performing above expectations for their economic size.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/15/intersolar-2023-day-2-welcome-back/,,PV MAGAZINE,"UPDATED JUNE 26, 2023 11:50 AM CET",Intersolar 2023 Day 2: QN Solar shows China is still top dog for PV,"Mark Hutchins headed over to Infolink Consulting’s booth for a look at the numbers behind the growing markets for solar technology, as exemplified by relentless activity across the exhibition floor.
Analyst Amy Fang said Infolink expects global installations this year to come in at between 385 GW and 450 GW, capped by a late surge in numbers from China as large projects are expected to reach completion in Q4.
InfoLink expects Europe to install between 90 GW and 120 GW this year and Fang notes the region remains somewhat constrained by project delays, with investors waiting for promised price declines to materialize.
Module prices are expected to fall with InfoLink forecasting levels of $0.17 to $0.18/W by the end of the year. This will be driven by polysilicon moving into oversupply, with enough to produce 50 GW of solar modules expected to be available in the fourth quarter, against demand for 42 GW.
pv magazine‘s Mark Hutchins has met with one manufacturer that, tucked away in the back of hall C4, is nursing big expansion plans.
Having first moved into PV cell and module production in 2020 – after several years providing engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services to large solar projects in China – QN Solar today has manufacturing capacity of 28 GW for cells and 25 GW for modules up and running, and expects to reach 69 GW for cell and 40 GW for modules this year.
As QN Solar Chairman Stephen Cai explained, even China’s domestic PV market is not large enough to absorb that amount of production capacity so the company is looking to supply projects further afield. Cai says QN Solar is moving into Latin American markets, Japan, and the Middle East – where it has signed contracts to supply a 2.5 GW project in Abu Dhabi to be completed by 2025.
The manufacturer also places Europe among its top target markets and Cai says he is considering setting up an EPC business on the continent – convinced QN’s experience working on large scale projects with utilities in China would make it a valuable player in this market.
Cai sees Romania, Slovakia and several other countries in Eastern Europe as under-developed in terms of PV and offering significant opportunities for the types of project – ideally around the 100 MW mark – that QN is used to dealing with.
The company has also begun supplying batteries to projects in China and says it will roll this out globally from next year, given batteries are increasingly a requirement when it comes to developing solar projects.
Those numbers – and the speed at which QN Solar’s manufacturing plans are taking shape – show we can expect China to remain the clear leader in solar manufacturing at scale. They also outline the size of the challenge ahead for Europe if the region wishes to meet a significant chunk of its PV demand with locally produced modules.
Chinese lithium-ion battery manufacturer Hithium has entered the European market with a new office in Munich and a debut at the Smarter E show, writes Marija Maisch. Established only four years ago, the company is growing at a breakneck pace.
“We are expanding from the current 15 GWh to 70 GWh by the year’s end, and up to 135 GWh by 2025,” says Hithium VP for Sales and Marketing, Mizhi Zhang. Manufacturing in Europe is also on the cards.
The Chinese unicorn company has attracted a long list of investors. “More than 50% of them are institutional investors and the rest is coming from strategic investors, such as downstream application and mining companies,” Zhang adds.
He says Hithium, which does not make EV batteries and solely specializes in static energy storage systems, has attracted funding by virtue of its innovative technology. Hithium’s lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathodes are designed to slowly release lithium ions, resulting in lower cell degradation.
“Unlike other LFP cells, Hithium’s 300 Ah battery cell displays less than 2% of degradation in the first 10o0 cycles,” Zhang says.
So far, the company has deployed more than 9 GW of battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity, more than 85% of which is in China. For this year, Hithium expects to another single-digit GW to be deployed.
While the Intersolar halls are thronged with visitors, sales appear hard to come by – according to analyst reports – making the market dynamic in 2023 the polar opposite of the previous year.
The S&P Global Commodities Insight team swung by the pv magazine booth and told editors Mark Hutchins and Jonathan Gifford that changing supply and demand dynamics have led to purchase orders for module makers being hard to come by.
They explained that when a rapid change in supply-and-demand occurs, activity grinds to a halt.
The S&P team said that when there is a sizeable market correction it slows down investment decisions, causing delays as both buyers and sellers recalibrate what they believe is the right price.
For the German balcony-solar market, Solis has a new mini inverter series designed to connect solar panels to a low voltage battery. The S6-GR1P(0.6-0.8)K-UM inverter has a 2 m EU-type plug and a rack mounting that enables easy plug and play installation. The system comes in two models – a 600 W and an 800 W version – each with a rated voltage of 60 V and a maximum efficiency of 96.6%.
Additionally, the S6-GR1P(2.5-6)K-S 6th generation single-phase inverter, by Solis, was designed especially for smaller balcony and residential PV installations. The inverter allows for self-consumption by homeowners as well as time-of-use optimization and whole-home backup power. This solution is IEEE 1547-2018 and UL 1741 SA & SB certified, and it is supported by the Solis Cloud mobile app, which provides real-time monitoring for both solar installers and homeowners.
Other inverters on display at the company’s booth at Intersolar include the S6 Advanced Power Hybrid Inverter, which was recently launched to support South African residential and C&I uses, in conditions where grids are particularly unstable. This advanced inverter supports multiple parallel machines to form single-phase or three-phase systems.
pv magazine covered the launch of the inverter for South Africa here.
The S6 series of inverters is on display at the Solis booth in Hall B3 (B3.430).
Artist Polona Petek is giving Bisol's booth some creative inspiration with large-scale solar module painting taking place across Intersolar, writes Tristan Rayner.
Petek, well-known in Slovenian art circles, told a curious stream of onlookers that the glass on an old Bisol polysilicon module was a perfect canvas, good for acrylics and oil.
Katja Ertl, marketing manager at Bisol, said the idea leaned into the company's marketing of its Made In Europe modules being “European art,” and she is enjoying the conceptual approach.
While TOPCon is surging to become the largest n-type [negatively-doped] technology, heterojunction (HJT) is achieving some impressive results with “champion” cell efficiencies above 25%, according to manufacturer reports.
On the back of this technological progress, some sizeable deals are beginning to flow, writes Jonathan Gifford.
Risen was one of the first large Chinese manufacturers to adopt HJT technology and it has signed a 1 GW supply deal for its HJT Hyper-ion modules at Intersolar.
The deal was signed with distributor One Stop Warehouse, which first got its foothold in the Australian solar market and is now expanding into the United States and Europe.
Risen’s strategy for gaining market acceptance for its HJT technology aims to first address the utility-scale market segment before moving onto rooftops. The Hyper-ion utility scale module has over 700 W in peak power, with a smaller module available for commercial and industrial (C&I) rooftops to be introduced to the market in September.
Conduct Technical Solutions, Dutch specialists in rooftop solutions for fire safety on solar rooftops, has presented a new shelter design for inverters at Intersolar, writes Tristan Rayner.
The new PV Shelter Angled solves a problem of traditional shelters by removing shadow from rooftops while maintaining easy installation features, designed specifically with a wide range of inverter manufacturers in mind with a simple adjustable height and technical guides for easy installation.
Its bright orange paint job possibly leans into its Dutch origins…
Pieter Kremer, founder and managing director of the business, showed pv magazine the product's design features, noting cautious cable management design to avoid bending, special Magnelis galvanizing of steel, and more.
The new DC-coupled commercial battery from Israel-based SolarEdge will be available in the second half of next year.
Designed for small- to medium-sized commercial PV installations, the storage solution provides 58 kWh of capacity and is suitable for indoor use.
Up to eight batteries can be connected per inverter to deliver up to 460 kWh of storage capacity.
SolarEdge is touting an industry leading round-trip efficiency for the product through a shared DC bus, noting that hard figures will be released at a later stage. It would allow for DC/AC oversizing of 175%.
The system is compact and its modular architecture enables ease of installation and transportation, which can be handled by a two-person team.
The battery is suitable for indoor use in Europe and is expected to be certified for UL 9540A.
The system features nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cells made by SolarEdge subsidiary Kokam.
“As a vertically integrated battery manufacturer, we have the advantage of designing the cells in a way that they would fit the new systems and its applications,” says Ido Ginodi, VP for global products at SolarEdge.
“A battery without an energy management system (EMS) is a body without a soul,” says Ginodi. “These commercial battery systems want to be able to consider revenue stacking, time-of-use tariffs, EV chargers, self-consumption optimization, and grid services and this is what our SolarEdge ONE can deliver. ”
Is this the smallest inverter at Intersolar, asks Cornelia Lichner. It weighs only 350 g and fits completely into the frame of a PV module.
Solarnative produces its Power Sticks near Frankfurt, in Germany. The start-up wants to launch the microinverter, with an output of 350 W, next month, initially for balcony solar systems.
The product is suitable for modules with a generation capacity of up to 440 Wp, says marketing expert Florina Thaler.
The launch for the on-roof segment will follow in the autumn.
There are many advantages to using microinverters, says Thaler. Since each module stands alone, shading is no longer a problem. In addition, only a small amount of voltage is required to start feeding.
The new product has already integrated grid and system protection and DC overvoltage protection.
At the end of a module string, a communication unit connects the system to the internet, whereby individual inverters are recognized and automatically mapped without scanning a product code.
Anyone who would like to try the product can register for the introductory campaign (with a discount) at booth B4.470.
Tariffs alone will not save European solar production, writes Marian Willuhn. Jürgen Reinert, CEO of inverter manufacturer SMA, says it is important to price in factors such as sustainability, durability, quality and access to raw materials. Policymakers need staying power for this, Reinert says. Investment security is best implemented when programs are in place for many years.
The SMA boss is well-disposed toward the European Net-Zero Industry Act. The right signals are being sent, even if the program in its current form provides less money directly to companies than President Biden's IRA. “If it's done sensibly and looked at in a long time horizon, then we should be able to achieve similar successes as with the IRA,” Reinert says.
It would be important for funding to ensure that as much of the value chain as possible also benefits in Europe. SMA is currently doubling its manufacturing capacity from 20 GW to 40 GW. Reinert says that this will not only create 250 jobs in Kassel, at SMA, but around three times as many jobs at suppliers.
That would be significantly better for the economy than assembling an inverter that was developed in Asia and merely bolted together in Europe.
SMA is also showing a new development from Kassel at Intersolar. The new single-phase hybrid inverter Sunny Boy Smart Energy comes in four power classes ranging from 3.6 kW to 6 kW.
The Sunny Boy Smart Energy is equipped with three MPP [maximum power point] trackers and a “Shade-Fix” function for optimized yields. The hybrid inverter is compatible with high-voltage batteries from a number of manufacturers.
For the first time, SMA is also introducing its own battery, the SMA Home Storage product. The unit is available with capacities from 3.2 kWh to 16.2 kWh. An emergency power outlet is available on the storage system and a separate circuit can be defined for devices that need to continue to be powered in the event of a power outage.
In addition, the SMA inverter can directly, continuously control heat pumps from Stiebel Eltron, Vaillant, and Tecalor.
Both products will be available from the fourth quarter.
Futurasun has said work on its cell production factory in Suzhou will begin next month, writes Sergio Matalucci. The factory is expected to be up and running in March.
“The panels will also be for the local market, not only Chinese, but in general Asian,” said Alessandro Barin, MD of the Cittadella-headquartered business.

The internet-of-things (IoT) is conquering the solar mounting system segment, as can be seen at the stand of manufacturer K2, writes Michael Fuhs.
Modules are getting bigger and that's a challenge when they have to be mounted to withstand high loads.
If you clamp standard modules, with a format of 1.8 m by 1.11 m, for example, the long side of the module often only withstands a load of 1,800 pascals. In areas where snow falls, this value load is quickly exceeded. Therefore, many installers clamp on the short side. This increases time and material consumption considerably, according to K2.
The company therefore offers a pressure sensor for its flat-roof system. “This allows you to clamp the modules on the long side,” K2's Lars Kreemke says.
The sensor is connected to a monitoring system. It sounds an alarm as soon as the pressure load is exceeded. In case of doubt, someone will have to shovel snow.
“In this way, you can reduce the cost of materials by up to 50%,” adds Kreemke.
It is not for nothing that he works for K2 in Switzerland. There are areas in the Alpine nation where you have to reckon with loads of 6,000 pascals.
Engineers have been planning ground-mounted solar systems for a long time but, surprisingly, there are still things that cannot be easily implemented with planning software, according to Julian Scheer, from RatedPower.
Based at stand 450 in Hall A3, Scheer is one of the developers of the pvDesign software and strives to simplify and speed up the planning process, writes Cornelia Lichner.
As an example, Scheer cited small ground-mounted systems that usually cannot be planned without maintenance roads. He and his team, however, have already mastered many a challenge.
The new “enverus integration” makes it possible to simply select US parcels of land on a map instead of integrating the surveyed parcels via an Autocad file, as was previously the case.
If you are a planner and understand the advantage of this new feature, drop in and visit Julian to see the other innovations RatedPower has to offer.
Our pv mag correspondents tell us our flagship print publication is in evidence at booths across the Munich show but don't worry if you can't be in Munich, you can sign up for a subscription here.
In the latest issue of pv magazine we turn the spotlight onto European solar with a comprehensive review of the state of the PV industry across the region’s key markets and a look at the legislation which aims to drive a solar rooftop boom. We also examine the difficulty of establishing a solar panel recycling industry in Australia, where industry backbiting isn’t helping matters.
pv magazine Deutschland‘s Cornelia Lichner writes: It was clear to me that photovoltaic modules have to withstand a lot but I was amazed at how much they can actually endure.
The modules of wholesaler IBC Solar's brand can sag up to 6.9 cm under heavy pressure without breaking. And you can see the bend – clearly. If it weren't so loud at Intersolar, you would definitely hear the module squeaking.
Three times a day, solar modules are subjected to a static-mechanical load test on the load table of the Sunlab test laboratory to prove their quality. Impressive live tests will take place every day of the trade fair, at 11:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m., and 4:00 p.m. in Hall A4 at stands A4.470 and A4.570.
More and more manufacturers are starting to test modules in an installation situation, as IBC has done for many years, says Sunlab's Florian Spinler. The frame must not deform, the clamps must not slip, the cells and glass must not break, and the module must not rest on the roof.
After such tests, more stringent than required by IEC standards, IBC gives a 15-year guarantee on its products.
German electrolyzer companies are reporting a notable increase in interest for hydrogen systems since the invasion of Ukraine, writes Sergio Matalucci.
“What really changed is the speed of the decision making process,” Peter Podesser, chief executive of SFC Energy said at Intersolar.
Similar comments have been heard from other hydrogen companies present at the show. “The key element (for hydrogen development) is political will,” said Lhyfe’s David Uhde.
If you put up a sign at Intersolar saying “Factory Price,” you shouldn't be surprised when solar news hounds might want to know the figure, writes Tristan Rayner.
Shenzen-based Pcenersys had the sign but company representative Orien Xu was a little tight-lipped once it became clear we were keen to publish a pricetag for 10 kWh of storage, as opposed to putting in an order for several thousand units, for example.
Pushed to give rough pricing for the benefit of pv magazine readers across the industry, Xu let us know that a 10 kWh Powerwall, using 48 V 200 Ah LifePO4 batteries, would be around $2,000, with a wink or a nod that this price might fall for a larger order.
PV module supplier sustainability credentials are increasingly influencing investor decisions, says Trina Solar. The company is set to close a major agreement with “a major fund,” to supply almost 1 GW of modules.
Trina’s president for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa – Gonzalo de la Viña – said that price “was not the top consideration” for the fund in question. He said that Trina’s environmental credentials, as featured in its annual sustainability report, played a major role in sealing the deal.
De la Viña highlighted Trina’s “zero-carbon park” in Qinghai, at which its first monocrystalline ingot was produced in February.
The vertically-integrated Qinghai facility is planned to have an ingot capacity of 20 GW once complete and at present sources more than 90% of its electricity from green energy sources. With the application of a smart grid, and through clean energy procurement, the facility is intended to source all of its energy from renewables.
Trina Solar has also established what it reports is the first certified net-zero fab in the PV industry, located in Yiwu – where its Vertex S modules are produced. “This is something I, personally, am very proud of,” said de la Viña. “This is what the future is. The EU wants net zero and we are already achieving this with one factory.”
pv magazine dropped by Reuniwatt’s booth for a look at the company’s Sky Insight thermal imager – which tracks the movement and temperature of clouds to provide a forecast of solar energy output up to 30 minutes ahead, combined with satellite data for forecasting further ahead.
Reuniwatt Business Development Manager Marion Lafuma says such forecasts offer can offer project owners various advantages in energy trading, avoiding curtailment and other areas, writes Mark Hutchins. This year the company is particularly targeting customers in the off-grid sector, and PV systems powering operations such as remote mining. Here, Lafuma explains, forecasts can be particularly valuable in enabling customers to optimize their use of backup diesel generators and significantly cut energy costs.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/15/us-green-hydrogen-market-set-to-surge-to-1-4-trillion-by-2050-says-deloitte/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 15, 2023","US green hydrogen market set to surge to $1.4 trillion by 2050, says Deloitte","From pv magazine USA
A new report from the Deloitte Center for Sustainable Progress (DCSP) outlines the potential of green hydrogen, or hydrogen fuel produced by renewable energy sources, to meet the demands of heavy industry. 
The report set global market milestones of $642 billion by 2030, $980 billion by 2040, and $1.4 trillion by 2050, with growth in the industry split among the major global economies relatively evenly by mid-century, as seen below. This level of investment would represent a cumulative $9 trillion push by the global economy by 2050. 
Hard-to-abate sectors like steelmaking, chemical manufacturing, aviation and global shipping require high amounts of energy dispatch, something that can be difficult for electrochemical batteries to achieve. While batteries may serve mobile devices, electric vehicles, and grid-scale energy storage, hydrogen may present a viable path forward for decarbonizing these high-dispatch use cases.
The report said that these sectors may drive hydrogen demand and use six-fold by 2050, leading to nearly 600 million tons of hydrogen fuel use. While hydrogen electrolysis requires large amounts of electricity, the only byproduct of burning hydrogen fuel is water, making it an emissions-free source when created by renewable sources.
However, based on current green hydrogen project announcements, the global community could only provide a collective production capacity to meet one quarter of the projected demand in 2030, said Deloitte.
It estimates that green hydrogen could abate 85 gigatons of cumulative emissions by 2050, which equates to more than twice the annual total emissions in the year 2021.
Deloitte said that decisive climate action can help push the competitiveness of green hydrogen. After about 10 years, green hydrogen can become cost-competitive, said Deloitte, leading to the creation of 2 million jobs per year between 2030 and 2050. The firm said that as much as 70% of this job growth could occur in developing countries.
“Money is not the problem – though the average annual investment over the time period is significantly less than the $417 billion that was spent on oil and gas production in 2022 globally,” said Bernhard Lorentz, the founding chair of the DCSP. “It’s just a question of redirecting the investment to clean energy sources, and Deloitte sees that the global finance industry has an increasing appetite for major investments.”
The projections come from Deloitte’s Hydrogen Pathway Explorer (HyPE) model, which delivers analysis of the global hydrogen supply. Deloitte’s outlook provides extensive detail into the cost, production, and market of hydrogen, even analyzing the business challenges facing the successful implementation of clean hydrogen, and providing insights into various market dynamics, such as optimal infrastructure sizing, investment needs, and technology choices.
“This analysis reveals a compelling opportunity for private and public leaders to accelerate the green energy transition,” said Joe Ucuzoglu, global chief executive officer of Deloitte. “While wind, solar, and other more traditional forms of renewable power are essential to a net-zero future, Deloitte’s research demonstrates how clean hydrogen can help tackle decarbonization of some of the world’s most emissions intensive and hardest-to-abate sectors, further mitigating the effects of climate change while fueling economic growth, particularly in developing countries.”
Deloitte said that interregional trade and diversified transport infrastructure could become a key driver in green hydrogen development adoption.
“Regions that are currently able to produce cost-competitive hydrogen in quantities that exceed domestic needs are already positioning themselves as future hydrogen exporters – supplying other less-competitive regions and helping to smoothly facilitate the energy transition,” said the report.
Deloitte has also launched the Deloitte Global Hydrogen Center of Excellence, which helps hydrogen developers scale up their businesses through advisory, implementation, and operational guidance services.
