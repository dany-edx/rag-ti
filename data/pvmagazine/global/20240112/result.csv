https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/12/scalable-thermochemical-energy-storage-for-renewable-energy/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 12, 2024",Scalable thermochemical energy storage for renewable energy,"RedoxBlox has developed a high-temperature TCES technology which boasts energy density on par with lithium-ion battery technology, while utilizing inexpensive and abundant raw materials.
The company’s storage material operates at temperatures up to 1,500 C and can be fully charged in less than four hours. It is billed as non-toxic, non-flammable, and fully recyclable.
The RedoxBlox storage module features a vessel filled with a proprietary and abundantly available, low-cost metal oxide material. To charge, renewable electricity heats the metal oxide pellets from 1,000 C to 1,500 C, triggering a chemical reaction that releases oxygen and stores heat in the form of chemical energy.
Later, when stored energy is needed, air is directed through the module and the metal oxide consumes oxygen to reverse the reaction and release heat to the air. Hot air from the RedoxBlox module can then deliver heat to an array of industrial processes or to a gas turbine to generate electricity, thus serving as a drop-in replacement for natural gas.
With its solution, RedoxBlox aims to enable electrification of industrial heat for the difficult-to-decarbonize sectors including – cement, steel, food and beverage, refining and chemicals manufacturing. It also seeks to enable more renewable electricity sources such as solar and wind to come onto the electrical grid through ultra-low-cost energy storage.
Since 2018, when it identified proprietary redox material with record-breaking energy density of 2,500 MJ/m3, RedoxBlox has passed numerous milestones both in terms of technology development and funding.
The company said this week that it has secured $8.9 million from the California Energy Commission (CEC) and $6.7 million from the US Department of Energy (DOE).
These grants follow the company’s $9.4 million Series A financing led by Khosla Ventures for a total of $25 million to support demonstrations of RedoxBlox’s TCES technology.
In partnership with the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), the CEC selected RedoxBlox to pioneer long-duration energy storage solutions. Hosted by UCSD, the project will leverage RedoxBlox’s technology to power a turbogenerator, providing up to 24 hours of energy storage capacity.
Similarly, the DOE’s Industrial Efficiency and Decarbonization Office selected RedoxBlox for a first-of-its-kind, industrial-scale TCES, conducted in partnership with Dow and EPRI. This application will showcase the decarbonization of industrial steam at the Dow West Virginia plant through electrification using long-duration TCES.
“Our goal is simple: use electrification and thermochemical energy storage to compete as a zero-carbon replacement for natural gas,” said RedoxBlox CTO Joerg Petrasch. “We have proven the science. Our focus now is to scale up to commercially relevant sizes. Funding from the DOE and CEC across two large markets and the partnerships with our customers across multiple industrial sectors are key enablers.”
In addition to Khosla Ventures, RedoxBlox is backed by top climate technology firms, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV). BEV led the company’s Seed round and participated in its Series A fundraising round.
RedoxBlox has operations in the United States and Europe. The company’s main headquarters and R&D facility are in San Diego, California. It also has a large-scale prototype testing facility in Bend, Oregon. Its European subsidiary is based in Dornbirn, Austria.

It marked this milestone with the installation of its first residential Avalon System in late December.
The Avalon HV ESS system features a smart energy panel, customizable battery stack, and inverter. The system works inside and outside and is scalable up from 14.4 kWh to 176 kWh. It can be DC- or AC-coupled, with 200 A pass-through.
Operating at 200 V to 300 V at the DC terminal, the Avalon System closely matches PV array voltage, reducing the need for DC to DC conversion which, according to the manufacturer, enhances overall operational efficiency by approximately from 6 to 8%. 
The system includes a 7.6 kW or 11.4 kW inverter. It has four MPPTs with a voltage range of 80 V to 520 V and maximum input current per string of 16 A.
The Avalon Smart Energy Panel manages large loads in the house to stop the inverter from tripping. It can intelligently manage up to twelve different 120 V circuits, six 240 V circuits, or any combination, providing flexible whole home backup without a dedicated emergency power panel. 
With the integrated smart load panel, pre-installed AC coupling circuit, 200 A pass-through and straightforward EV charger installation, the Avalon System reduces the need for extra components, such as back up panel, AC combiner, separate smart load panel, bypass, and other, the manufacturer says.
Avalon boast a cycle life of more than 8,000 cycles and comes with a 10-year warranty. The system is based on tier 1 automotive grade lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells.
Furthermore, for homeowners, Avalon could be turned into a source of revenue through the company's EnergyBroker program by selling energy into wholesale markets or to extra energy.
“This helps achieve a shorter payback period while contributing to a more resilient and efficient power grid,” Fortress Power says.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/12/dark-december-for-northern-europe-sunny-in-the-south/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",,"JANUARY 12, 2024","Dark December for northern Europe, sunny in the South","A series of intense low pressure systems extending from the Baltics to the UK pulled moisture off of the Atlantic, bringing cloud and resulting in lower irradiance over Northern, Central and Western Europe this December. This increased cloud led to solar assets in Northern Germany and the Netherlands receiving only 70% of normal irradiance, according to data collected by Solcast, a DNV company, via the Solcast API. Due to short winter days, this is off of an extremely low base average.
This cloud activity did not make it below the Alps, and Southern Europe saw reduced rain and significantly less cloud than normal, with some regions experiencing 130% of the normal December irradiance.

Despite the cold and snowy start to the month, with heavy snowfall bringing both reduced irradiance and snow soiling for solar assets, most of the continent saw a relatively mild month. This pattern is in line with a normal El Nino year, typically seeing milder and wetter weather to the start of winter in Northern Europe, becoming colder and drier as the months continue. Southern Europe also saw warmer than normal temperatures, following the trend of 2023 as the hottest year on record and approaching a 1.5-degree increase from climatological averages.

While solar production in Northern Europe was suppressed, December saw records for wind power fall due to the strong winds driven by several significant storms. Late in the month Storms Pia and Gerrit disrupted holiday travel plans but also helped both the UK and Germany reach new records for wind generation. This helped Germany keep on track to exceed 50% of power from renewable sources across 2023, despite the reduced contribution from Solar generation in winter.
The effects of these storms were significant, as you can see from the below daily GHI image from December 21st, cloud associated with Storm Pia blocked irradiance from Scotland to the Pyrenees.

Solcast produces these figures by tracking clouds and aerosols at 1-2km resolution globally, using satellite data and proprietary AI/ML algorithms. This data is used to drive irradiance models, enabling Solcast to calculate irradiance at high resolution, with typical bias of less than 2%, and also cloud-tracking forecasts. This information is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets throughout the world.

Compatible with existing or new green roofs, the solution enhances building thermal efficiency, in line with with France's 2021 Climate and Resilience standards, which require 30% rooftop coverage with greenery or solar.
The solution, targeted at developers and building owners, combines a green roof with PV panels, boosting panel efficiency by 12%, according to Adivet data.
“It is the refreshing effect of the green carpets which makes it possible to improve the performance of the modules during the summer,” Aurélien Cassagnet, head of real estate operations at Vegetek, told pv magazine France. “Without any risk for the species planted under the panels. On the contrary, the photovoltaic installation creates different nooks and shades, conducive to an increase in biodiversity.”
The novel roof solution can reportedly be adapted to all types of solar panels.
The only constraint is the capacity of a rooftop to support the weight of an installation, said Vegetek.
Vegetek is based in Cenon near Bordeaux, France. It is a unit of Demonchy, a France-based supplier of raw materials for thermoplastics, food, personal care, coatings, sealants and the adhesives market.

The IEA has pointed to grid bottlenecks, a lack of new federal government support, and growing investment costs as among the reasons for reining in its forecast for renewable energy growth in Australia by more than 10%.
The agency also highlighted “continued policy uncertainty” following early achievement of Australia’s Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) among the reasons for it revising down the country’s forecast renewable energy additions for the 2023-28 forecast period.
“In Australia, a lack of new federal incentives and rising investment costs have delayed the development of new projects,” the IEA said in Renewables 2023, the latest edition of the France-based agency’s annual market report on the sector.
“Notably, the distributed PV segment, which has been the primary source of growth in Australia in recent years, is forecast to experience a faster-than-anticipated decline in installations due to saturation of the power system and increasing grid integration challenges,” the IEA said, noting that governments will need to address the issues or risk falling well short of the tripling of renewable energy capacity by 2030 that was agreed to at the COP28 climate summit in December.
Australia is one of more than 100 countries that backed a pledge made at the summit in Dubai to triple the world’s renewable energy generation capacity by the end of the decade.
“Overcoming grid bottlenecks, streamlining lengthy permitting processes and enhancing system flexibility should be prioritised to accelerate deployment of renewables,” the IEA said, adding that even projects nearing completion in Australia can still be subject to delays with commissioning processes sometimes taking “a year or longer.”

Despite reining in Australia’s forecast growth, the IEA remains bullish on solar power as a whole, predicting that PV and wind will account for 95% of global renewable expansion over the 2023-28 period covered by the forecast.
The amount of renewable energy capacity added to energy systems around the world grew by 50% in 2023, reaching almost 510 GW, with PV accounting for three-quarters of additions worldwide.
IEA analysis shows that under existing policies and market conditions, global renewable power capacity is now expected to grow to 7,300 GW over the next five years. Solar PV and wind account for 95% of the expansion, with renewables overtaking coal to become the largest source of global electricity generation by early 2025.
The report also shows that prices for solar modules in 2023 declined by almost 50% year-on-year, with cost reductions and fast deployment set to continue with global manufacturing capacity forecast to reach 1,100 GW by the end of 2024, significantly exceeding demand.
While the outlook for solar is bright, the report provides a reality check on the momentum behind green hydrogen, assessing how many announced projects are likely to go ahead.
The IEA said that more than 360 GW of electrolyser projects with start dates before 2030 had been announced but only 3% of them had reached financial close or started construction.
The agency anticipates that of all the projects announced worldwide to use renewables to produce hydrogen this decade, only 7% of the proposed capacity is expected to come online by 2030.
“The forecast is also less optimistic for Asia-Pacific, mostly due to uncertainty in Australia over the future of stalled projects,” the IEA said. “One project’s environmental permit had lapsed before it reached financial close, and plans for projects in Bell Bay have been put on hold due to high water and transmission congestion.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/12/hybridizing-residential-ground-source-heat-pumps-with-pvt-free-cooling/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HEAT PUMPS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,SWEDEN,WESTERN EUROPE",LIOR KAHANA,"JANUARY 12, 2024","Hybridizing residential ground source heat pumps with PVT, free cooling","Scientists from Sweden’s KTH Royal Institute of Technology have investigated the potential coupling of a ground source heat pump (GSHP) with both photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) energy and free cooling (FC).
“Based on the results, it makes sense to couple free cooling with PVT and heat pumps in cases in which the interference between the two systems is low,” corresponding author Dr. Francisco Beltrán told pv magazine. “The cooling demand has to be significantly lower than the heating demand;  the free cooling heat exchanger should be located after the borehole field but before the PVT heat exchanger to minimize interference; and the PVT array needs to be carefully sized so it does not become over-dimensioned.”
In the context of ground source heat pump systems, free cooling utilizes the soil as a heat sink using only a heat exchanger and a circulation pump. “This approach allows the heat to be taken from indoor spaces to provide cooling while simultaneously regenerating the borehole heat exchanger,” the researchers explained.
In the proposed configuration of the so-called multi-source (MS) system, PVT and FC are utilized to regenerate ground temperature in the borehole. In unbalanced systems, ground temperature decreases over time due to heat extraction, reducing the overall system efficiency and causing the heat pump to shut down.
Using the simulation software, the researchers assessed the ideal placement of the FC in the system in a multi-family house in Stockholm.
“Since both the PVT and FC loops are competing against each other during the summer months to use the borehole field as a heat sink, it becomes necessary to do an interference analysis of the MS system for the three different system configurations,” they explained.

According to their finding, the ideal placement is between the borehole heat exchanger (BH) and the PVT, as it achieves an interference ratio of 0.89%. In comparison, placing the FC between the heat pump (HP) and the BH had a ratio of 12.2%, and placing it between the PVT and the HP had an interference of 19.25%.
“The results show that the most important factor that causes interference between the two systems is their relative placement in the system,” they highlighted. “However, this configuration reduces the thermal yield of the PVT collector by 7.24% compared to the PVT+GSHP case.”
The group compared the performance of the MS system with that of a GSHP alone, that of a GSHP using only FC, and that of a GSHP using only PVT. Other variables compared in the simulation were the number of boreholes the system uses (4-6), the spacing between them (5m-15m), and the number of modules on the PVT unit (0-144).
“Free cooling has a minimal impact on the seasonal performance factor (SPF) of the GSHP system, enhancing it at most by 0.7% for the smallest borehole field,” they stated. “On the other hand, the SPF4 of the GSHP+PVT systems gradually converges with that of a multi-source system as the number of PVT modules increases. This phenomenon arises because the proportion of heat injected by the PVT system becomes more significant relative to that of FC.”
Concluding their work, the research group assessed that the FC’s contribution to improving the SPF of the MS system is minimal compared to the contribution of PVT. “The only scenario studied where FC can reduce the land requirement is if the BH spacing is decreased to 10m, which leads to a reduction of 66.6% with a slightly lower SPF of 3.16 compared to 3.17 for GSHP-only,” they noted.
Their findings were presented in “Solar Photovoltaic/Thermal (PVT) Technology Collectors and Free Cooling in Ground Source Heat Pump Systems,” published in Solar Energy Advances. “The results demonstrate that the integration of PVT and FC not only maintains the cooling supply but also enhances heat pump performance, all the while reducing borehole length and land area requirements,” they concluded.

“In monolithic perovskite solar modules, the migration of ions in the interconnect region is a critical factor that affects both efficiency and stability,” Shaohang Wu, a researcher at Jinan University, told pv magazine. “To address this issue, Jinan University and Mellow Energy have proposed an innovative method for in-situ generation of ion barrier layers, resulting in a substantial enhancement in efficiency and stability. This gas-phase treatment technique requires simple equipment, is user-friendly, and eliminates the need for additional coating processes, making it highly suitable for integration into production lines.”
The scientists fabricated the panel with an inverted perovskite cell based on an anti-diffusion layer, a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), a hole transport layer (HTL) made of poly-triarylamine (PTAA), a 3D-2D perovskite absorber hybridized with PoBx species, an electron transport layer (ETL) based on a buckminsterfullerene (C60) and tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), and a silver (Ag) metal. They interconnected the solar cells via P1, P2, and P3 scribes.
They explained that the ETL was deposited on the perovskite absorber via atomic layer deposition (ALD) to inhibit the vertical escape of volatile species. They then applied post-annealing to improve the redistribution and recrystallization of the perovskite composition. The 2D/3D heterostructure is aimed at accelerating the charge extraction at the perovskite/C60 interface and suppressing light-induced halide segregation.
“PbOx materials are directionally generated by selective growth using a gas-solid reaction method,” the scientists said. “And we have confirmed that PbOx can be a good barrier and passivation layer.”
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 21.37%, an open-circuit voltage of 7.195 V, a short-circuit current of 47.15 mA, and a fill factor of 80.89%. The device was also able to retain around 90% of its initial efficiency after 1,184 h.
The solar module and the related manufacturing process were described in the paper “Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Modules Enabled by Inhibited Escape of Volatile Species,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials. “This scheme provides a good idea for achieving efficient and stable perovskite photovoltaic modules in industry,” the research group stated.
Another research group at Jinan University recently unveiled a perovskite solar module with an efficiency of 21.07%. This device was fabricated through selective nanosecond-pulse and laser-induced ablation to obtain the high-quality interconnection.

Plus Power has started operating its Kapolei Energy Storage (KES) facility on Oahu, Hawaii, helping the state in its transition from fossil fuels to solar and wind. 
The KES project adds 135 MW/540 MWh to the Hawaiian Electric grid, with an additional 50 MW/25 MWh of additional “fast frequency response” to support grid stability.
The advanced battery has “virtual inertia” to replicate the power-smoothing function of a conventional spinning turbine. It has “black start” capabilities, which supports grid recovery in the event of a blackout. 
“It’s the first time a battery has been used by a major utility to balance the grid: providing fast frequency response, synthetic inertia, and black start,” said Brandon Keefe, executive chairman, Plus Power. This project is a postcard from the future – batteries will soon be providing these services, at scale, on the mainland.”   
Located on 8 acres of industrial land on the southwest side of Oahu, the project is comprised of 158 Tesla Megapack 2 XL lithium-ferro-phosphate batteries, each about the size of a shipping container. 
The battery can serve as a grid “shock absorber,” serving a role normally performed by combustion-powered plants. It can respond to grid signals in 250 milliseconds, far faster than the several minutes that conventional power plants take to fire up. 
“Energy storage technology that responds quickly to constantly changing conditions is an essential tool for us to use to manage the grid and operate it as efficiently as possible,” said Jim Alberts, senior vice president and chief operations officer, Hawaiian Electric. 
Solar power has become abundant, leading Hawaiian Electric to have to curtail, or turn off, large volumes of utility-scale solar and wind to keep the system in balance. The new energy storage capacity is expected to allow the utility to reduce renewable energy curtailments by 69%. It is also expected to enable 10% more new utility-scale renewables on the grid than previous models allowed. 
Hawaiian Electric said it expects the battery to save its customers on electricity bills. The utility estimates the battery will reduce electric bills by $0.28 per month over its 20-year contract life. 
The KES battery plant is interconnected near three of Hawaiian Electric’s critical power generation facilities, enabling a rapid reboot of those power plants in the event of an island-wide emergency. This is known as “black start” capability. 
The batteries will help replace grid capacity formerly provided by an AES coal-fired power plant less than a mile away. The plant used to provide about 20% of Oahu’s electricity, home to nearly one million residents. The plant closed in September 2022. 
Project developer, owner, and operator Plus Power has a development portfolio of over 10 GW of projects in transmission queues across 28 states and Canada. It has over $1.8 billion in project financings announced as of October 2023. The company expects to be operating seven additional large-scale energy storage plants across Arizona and Texas, adding 1325 MW / 3500 MWh of storage by June 2024. 
“Our projects, like KES, help our customers provide affordable, reliable, clean electricity on hot summer afternoons and cold winter nights, while enabling the decarbonization of the electric grid,” said Keefe.

FOB China prices of Mono PERC M10 wafers trended flat on-week at $0.241 per piece (pc), while Mono PERC G12 wafer prices remained at $0.356/pc.

The primary cause of stable prices is a notable reduction in the availability of Mono PERC wafers, according to numerous sources. Multiple wafer producers have reportedly aggressively decreased operating rates for Mono PERC wafers in favor of switching their manufacturing lines from Mono PERC to n-type wafers.
In addition, some small and medium-sized wafer producers that have been selling their Mono PERC M10 wafers at low EXW pricing of between CNY1.8 ($0.25)/pc and CNY1.85/pc on the Chinese domestic market have successfully lowered their stock, according to a market observer. Consequently, the low-price portion for such wafers has vanished, with the majority of the price negotiation focused on the mainstream CNY1.93/pc, according to OPIS’ market survey.
There have also been reports of an impending price hike for Mono PERC wafers in the market. Multiple sources stated that a slight and temporary price increase for Mono PERC wafers may occur as a result of their decreasing supply.
Furthermore, the wafer market's total operating rate has decreased as a result of some companies' unstable n-type wafer production lines. According to the projection of the Silicon Industry of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, China's overall wafer production output in January might range from 54 GW to 56 GW, indicating a decline of 7.92% month over month.
According to a market expert, wafer manufacturers still try their best to maintain operating rates at a particular level despite the continuous wafer overcapacity. At present, polysilicon prices make up about half of wafer production costs, the source added, and went on to say that when polysilicon prices are nearly at their floor, it is essential for wafer makers to maintain specific operating rates to reduce non-silicon costs by as much as possible.
It’s an undeniable fact that the market for wafers is currently experiencing a severe overcapacity, according to a source in the polysilicon segment, who added that she is not optimistic about Chinese wafer businesses expanding into production overseas as one of the biggest obstacles is the high cost of producing abroad. Selecting a factory location in regions appropriate for labor-intensive businesses is crucial, said the source, who concluded that the best investment destination for this industry may still be Southeast Asia.

First Solar has inaugurated a new manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu, India, with a capacity of 3.3 GW.
India’s first fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing plant will produce First Solar’s Series 7 solar PV modules, which were optimized for the Indian market. The facility employs approximately 1,000 people.
The company has invested $700 million in the facility, including $500 million of previously announced financing from the US International Development Finance Corp. (DFC). The facility is First Solar’s sixth operational factory in the world, with others in the United States, Malaysia and Vietnam.
“The United States is leveraging American innovation and technology to diversify critical energy supply chains around the world and drive economic growth in India,” said DFC CEO Scott Nathan. “That’s good for the United States and it’s good for India. This $500 million in financing reflects the increasing strength of our partnership with India – DFC’s largest market and a like-minded partner with a dynamic private sector.”
First Solar reports that its thin-film PV modules are produced using a continuous process under one roof that does not rely on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains.
