The two nations signed an initial memorandum of understanding last November to signal their intent to build the solar project. They have since worked on feasibility studies and now aim “to develop the necessary implements in plans in time for COP28,” according to a statement by the Israeli Ministry of Energy.
Israeli Energy Minister Karine Elharrar described the project as “a geopolitical, economic and environmental” initiative that opens a “new page in relations” with Jordan. Iswai Farij, the Israeli minister of regional cooperation, also described the project as part of a “legacy of cross-border regional cooperation.”
“[It] creates hope for the entire region, when countries join together to promote optimal utilization of natural resources,” said Farij.

The project will include three solar installations.
Cleanwatts told pv magazine that it started developing 1.1 MW at Sao Tome airport and 300 kWp at Principe airport in August. It expects to complete the arrays by the end of this year. Another 300 kWp will be installed next year at other communities in Sao Tome.
“Like many islands around the world, Sao Tome depends greatly on a stable and affordable supply of energy. What we propose to do in this country is precisely to reduce dependence on imported energy through the production of locally sourced clean energy,” said Michael Pinto, the CEO of Cleanwatts. “We look forward to expanding this project into a second phase and broadening the perimeter of the communities that we serve.”
The country’s first solar project went online in August. The first phase of the 2 MW installation was built at a diesel power station in the city of Santo Amaro, with a capacity of 540 kWp. The project was backed by an investment of $690,000, funded by the United Nations Development Program and the Global Environment Fund.
According to data from the International Renewably Energy Agency (IRENA), Sao Tome and Principe did not have any grid-connected solar generation capacity installed at the end of 2021. The World Bank says Sao Tome and Principe has an electricity access rate of around 76%, with 92% of the total coming from imported diesel. The government has vowed to increase the proportion of renewable energy from 5% of the energy mix to 50% by 2030.

Eight companies have invested more than $9.2 billion in renewable energy in the Indian state of Karnataka in recent weeks. The wind-solar hybrid segment accounted for most of the investments from companies such as Azure Power and Ayana Renewable Power, as well as Tata Power Renewable Energy and Leap Green Energy.
“The future of renewable is hybrid. Plain vanilla wind or plain vanilla solar is no longer sufficient to meet the round-the-clock requirements of customers,” said Pratik Agarwal, managing director of Sterlite Power. “Customers want green, affordable, and firm power and Karnataka is the one state which has both wind and solar potential co-existing in the same state. It also has attractive sites for pumped hydro storage, which is a critical component of the round-the-clock value chain.”
Separately, PTC India said it has secured offers to supply 3.5 GW of hybrid wind-solar capacity. It received responses from 14 developers, including Tata Power Renewable Energy and Enel Green.

SilBuCam, a Spanish consulting firm that specializes in metallurgical processes, is producing solar-grade silicon as part of the SisAl Pilot project in Spain. It is led by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and involves 22 companies from nine countries on three continents, with a budget of €14 million ($13.9 million).
SilBuCam is coordinating by producing silicon metal in a circular, low-impact process. The new patented process does not generate CO2 and dispenses with coal, which introduces impurities.
“In addition to being much more sustainable, it is considerably cheaper,” Javier Bullón, general manager at SilBuCam, told pv magazine.
Specifically, it involves three times less energy consumption, eliminates direct emissions of CO2 and other harmful pollutants. It is also a circular process, as it transforms by-products derived from other processes – such as recycled aluminum and quartz fines – into new raw materials, such as silicon and metallurgical aluminum.
The SisAl Pilot, which has been running for two years, has two main goals. It will produce hypereutectic Al/Si alloys in Europe, as worldwide production is currently limited to China, for the most part. Second, it will produce silicon of sufficient quality for the solar industry, without generating CO2 and without using coal.
“We have to continue working and wait for the resurgent European photovoltaic industry to become interested in this silicon, which could mean independence from China in the manufacture of solar wafers,” said Bullón.
To move from the pilot phase to semi-industrial scale, the project will require an investment of €10 million.
“In the plant, and measured in kilowatt-hours, metallurgical silicon plates produce the same as polysilicon, with the advantage that they have much less heat loss, so that the modules installed in hot areas like Spain will work the same or better,” said Bullón.

The project is the first successfully commissioned solar-to-green hydrogen facility in Portugal.
The H2Évora pilot project features 15 of the company’s HEVO-solar hydrogen generators. They will produce an estimated 15 tons of green hydrogen per year. The generators combine miniaturized proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers fixed to the back of high-efficiency concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) panels.
The facility includes a 200 kW FCwave fuel cell module supplied by Canada-based Ballard Power. It is used to convert green hydrogen into electricity, enabling Fusion Fuel to sell power into the grid during periods of peak demand. H2Évora includes hydrogen purification, compression, and storage systems. It has been operating continuously since late 2021, and is now connected to the Portuguese electric grid.
“The facility will also serve as an important proving ground for our R&D team as we continue to roll out future iterations of our technology,” said Frederico Figueira de Chaves, chief financial officer of Fusion Fuel.
In August, Fusion Fuel secured a €10 million ($9.9 million) grant to develop the 6.6 MW HEVO-Industria green hydrogen project in Sines, Portugal. It will feature 300 solar hydrogen generators.

Daniel Andrews, the premier of the Australian state of Victoria, said that his government will spend AUD 42 million ($26.9 million) to install 100 neighborhood batteries if it is re-elected on Nov. 26.
Fifteen of the batteries will initially be installed in Melbourne and 13 in regional Victoria. Labor said it has committed to work with community groups, local governments and distribution companies to identify locations for the remaining 72 batteries.
The rollout of rooftop solar in Victoria is among the most impressive in Australia, with more than 200,000 Victorians having already installed solar panels on their rooftops. One in every five homes have a solar system installed, generating enough energy to meet one-third of Victoria’s total residential electricity demand but Andrews said the batteries will allow more residents to share the benefits of the “solar boom.”
Andrews said the neighborhood batteries are expected to triple the number of Victorian homes with access to storage, allowing more to return surplus solar-generated electricity to the grid through feed-in tariffs.
“It means more households will have access to cheaper renewable energy, even if they don’t have their own solar panels,” he said. “We think about 25,000 households will benefit from this.”
Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said the government plans to install all 100 batteries within the next term if it win another four years in office. She said the batteries will drive down power bills, but did not put a dollar figure on how much.
“The more neighbourhood batteries that we have, the cheaper the cost will be of poles and wires that they’re required to pay off their bills, and of course the energy that they use,” she said. “We know that that’s … one of the key solutions to us meeting our ambition to get to 95% renewable energy by 2035 and net zero emissions by 2045.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/10/new-mobile-lithium-ion-batteries-for-utility-scale-market/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"NOVEMBER 10, 2022",New mobile lithium-ion batteries for utility-scale market,"US-based NOMAD, a newcomer to the battery scene, recently unveiled a portfolio of utility-scale transportable battery energy storage solutions. Its plug-and-play solution combines a fully enclosed trailer chassis with high-density lithium-ion battery cells and a proprietary docking system. There are three versions of the system: a 1 MW/ 2 MWh unit called “The Traveler,” a 500 kW/1.3 MWh unit called “The Voyager,” and a 250 kW/ 660 kWh unit called “The Rover.”
The mobile units – when paired with the company's patent-pending PowerDock  system for easy connection/ disconnection, setup, upkeep, and secure system control – allow the fleet to arrive on-site in a completely weather-tight enclosure, with all wires contained within its unique interconnection system. All NOMAD systems also share a common interconnection design, allowing a single unit platform to be expanded with more PowerDocks. Each version uses lithium-ion cells made by KORE Power.
NOMAD units are said to combine the benefits of a fixed-site energy storage system that can be relocated, “enabling a single unit to serve multiple locations for seasonal, intermittent (outages) or temporary use (capital deferral), increasing asset utilization versus a fixed asset.”
The units have a range of use cases, including power backup and emergency response and seasonal load mitigation. The company says customers well suited to the technology include utilities, C&I entities, disaster relief organizations, and renewable generation assets.
NOMAD has also revealed that it has sold “the industry’s first mobile energy storage unit with 2 MWh capacity” to Vermont-based utility Green Mountain Power (GMP). Mari McClure, the CEO of GMP, said The Traveler offers a range of applications and provides another important innovation to join GMP's storage fleet, increasing resilience and reliability while lowering costs for customers.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/10/agrivoltaic-solar-tracker-uses-cables-instead-of-buried-steel/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 10, 2022",Agrivoltaic solar tracker uses cables instead of buried steel,"From pv magazine USA
Rute Foundation Systems, founded in Oregon in 2015, specializes in modular foundations for renewable energy. But in 2021 it focused its sites above ground, designing the patent-pending Suntracker for high-clearance solar installations like agrivoltaics.
Agrivoltaics, the practice of co-locating solar energy production with agriculture, has been gaining traction around the world as prime solar land becomes more scarce and the benefits of pairing solar with farmland become more obvious. For example, researchers at the University of Arizona have found that solar arrays improve crop yield in dry environments by providing shade. Furthermore, grazing sheep among solar panels has been used to manage grasses at the site, performing an agricultural form of O&M. An agrivoltaic array is typically raised above 8 feet to allow agriculture to continue underneath, and that’s where the Suntracker design comes in.
“Despite being beneficial for the landowner, agrivoltaics has historically been a difficult sell for the developer,” said Doug Krause, president of Rute Foundation Systems. “Now that we have a system with attractive economics to all stakeholders, we expect dual-use utility scale agrivoltaics to grow exponentially”
The Suntracker system is suspended by cables, rather than mounted on steel driven into the ground, providing what the company says is the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for high-clearance solar. Rute reports that by using cables rather than steel foundations, steel use is reduced by as much as 30%. Another advantage of the cable system is that the land does not have to be disturbed in order to install the system, which is a benefit in the agricultural industry. It also enables the land to be returned to its original condition in the event that the solar installation were to be removed.
Rute compares its Suntracker installation to a cable suspension bridge. The cables not only hold the system in place, just as in a suspension bridge, but they also use the cables to rotate the panels to track the sun,. The tracking systems provides up to 28% more electricity than fixed panels, the company reports. With its lower cost and the additional revenue from tracking, Rute says its Suntracker is the first agrivoltaic system to achieve a levelized LCOE competitive with conventional solar.
Rute received a grant from the US Department of Energy and Business Oregon to build a pilot, and the company is now building its proving ground at the manufacturing innovation center in Scappoose, Oregon.

The company claims the scalable, silent unit can produce 40% more energy than standalone rooftop solar.
“Our solution is made for flat top rooftop buildings more than 10 meters high. The higher they are, the less perturbated the wind will be,” Louis Dubar, a business engineer at Unéole, told pv magazine.
The system includes a scalable galvanized steel structure with a row of 2,000 W wind turbines topped with solar panels, for a total height of about 4 meters. The right number of wind turbines and PV panels per structure is project-specific. The company claims the solution works with all solar panels on the market.
“The project will depend a lot on the building. The roof size and what the final costumer wants will affect the number of solar panels we can install,” Dubar said. “Our solution is to install the steel structure on the strong points of the building that will frame our wind turbines and support the photovoltaic panels.”
The company claims that the energy yield is 40% higher than standalone solar. It said this offsets the higher capex of its hybrid solution.
“With our solution we can install two to four times more photovoltaic panels than a standard [rooftop solar] installation,” said Dubar. “We are installing these panels four meters high from the rooftop, so we can cover every technical structure that is installed on the rooftop.”
For a system installed in a 1,000 sqm rooftop, the company estimates a total cost of €300,000 ($302, 385) to € 500,000. The price includes the cost of the solar panels, wind turbines, steel structure, wiring, and project studies performed by Unéole.
The company is currently developing algorithms to determine the adequate number of wind turbines and PV panels for each project. Last year, it started testing the system in a field in the CD2e LumiWatt site in Loos-en-Gohelle, France.  Unéole expects to commercialize and install the first hybrid solution by late 2023 in France. It plans to expand to neighboring countries in 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/10/gallium-doping-for-24-47-efficient-p-type-heterojunction-solar-cells/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FRANCE,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 10, 2022",Gallium doping for 24.47%-efficient p-type heterojunction solar cells,"The solar industry has been interested in heterojunction (HJT) technology for many years. However, it requires the use of n-type silicon wafers, and wafer producers used to prefer lower-cost p-type wafers.
This year, HJT is again looking like the best way to improve cell performance. Wafer makers are beginning to produce n-type products at scale and are pursuing various cost-optimization strategies to close the gap with p-type products.
However, some people in the PV research community are choosing to pursue the alternate strategy of developing p-type wafers for HJT cell production, to match the performance of n-type. The introduction of gallium doping to p-type cell production has opened a lot of doors for this research, offering a solution to light-induced degradation that doesn’t require high temperatures. There are still some unanswered questions, but recent research has shown that p-type wafers could be used to fabricate HJT cells that rival the performance of n-type.
Scientists led by French research institute CEA INES demonstrated this potential by fabricating p-type HJT cells on a pilot line at their laboratory. Using wafers cut from a specially produced ingot with a low level of gallium doping, the group was able to demonstrate a best efficiency of 24.47%, and results consistently well above 23%.
“This work clearly suggests that the p- to n-type SHJ solar cell efficiency gap can be reduced without costly additional and/or more complicated process steps,” said the group. “The cells behave in a similar way to the n-type reference, which seems very promising for field applications.”
The researchers described the cells in “Closing the gap between n- and p-type silicon heterojunction solar cells: 24.47% efficiency on lightly doped Ga wafers,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. Based on previous research, the group worked on an assumption that p-type performance needs to be within 0.4% of that of n-type to be viable on cost basis.
The group said that more investigation will be needed on the cost of the moderate to low doping level for the ingots it procured specifically for this work. They also note that this time around, they fabricated the p-type cells based on standard process parameters used in n-type production, and that further optimizations to many of these might be possible to close the gap even further.
