Austria's Oesterreich Energie association has developed a map of network capacity to serve as a guide for system operators.
“A critical point in the construction of renewable generation plants is the sufficient availability of network capacities on site,” explained Franz Strempfl, a spokesman from the electricity industry association, noting that the map will help to facilitate the planning and deployment of PV systems. “In this way, we create transparency throughout Austria with regard to the current utilization of substations and thus facilitate the planning of the systems. We are currently experiencing enormous dynamism in the photovoltaic sector.”
The Austrian government introduced the ElWOG two years ago, leading to the creation of the map. These provisions prompted the country's grid operators to provide clarity about their available grid-connection capacities, among other requirements.
Oesterreich Energie will update the map on a quarterly basis, by using reports from Austrian system operators. The association said that the map offers an advance overview for grid connection requests, but does not replace them. Binding grid connection commitments must still be obtained from the grid operator for PV systems.
An industry survey by PV shows that securing a grid-connection permit is a significant challenge, as indicated by many market participants. In a survey, 66% of its members identified network access as a major challenge.
PV Austria is calling for modern e-business laws and aims to collaborate with the Ministry of Climate Protection and E-Control to eliminate obstacles to photovoltaic expansion.
Austria surpassed 1 GW of annual PV installations for the first time in 2022. PV Austria said that developers installed 1,009 MW of solar, surpassing 740 MW in 2021, 341 MW in 2020, and 247 MW in 2019. By the end of 2022, the country's cumulative PV capacity had reached 3.79 GW, accounting for 6.6% of the nation's electricity demand last year.

“We have fabricated several prototypes of the dual-source heat pump,” the research's lead author, Jing Li, told pv magazine. “The technology has been applied in some public buildings as well as in a residential house. Then, we also filed patent applications [in] EU, USA, and China.”
The prototype is based on two low-pressure evaporators (LEs), a medium-pressure evaporator (ME), an economizer, a plate-type condenser, a vapor injection compressor, expansion valves, and five air fans. Two of the fans are exhaust air devices and are placed on the top of the DSHP, while the other three fans are discharger air fan devices and are deployed on the bottom.
This system recovers the waste heat from the exhaust air along with absorbing the heat from the outdoor air. Its configuration allows the outdoor air to flow into the outdoor unit and mix with the cooled exhaust air, thus becoming a warmer mixed air, which then flows through the low-pressure evaporators for the second-stage heat exchange. The mixed air releases in turn all the heat energy into the low-pressure refrigerant and becomes colder discharge air than the outdoor ambient.
The vapor injection compressor compresses the evaporated refrigerant from the low-pressure evaporators and mixes it with the medium-pressure refrigerant. The resulting colder refrigerant mixture is then discharged to the plate-type condenser, where the mixture itself releases heat energy to the water.
“Subsequently, a part of the refrigerant flows into the medium-pressure evaporator and economizer for medium-pressure evaporation after corresponding throttling,” the scientists explained, noting that its refrigerant is R410A and the optimum refrigerant charge is 13 kg. “The rest [of the] refrigerant flows through the economizer for subcooling followed by low-pressure evaporation in low-pressure evaporators, finishing a cycle.”
The research group tested the performance of the system on the roof of the central library of the University of Hull, in the United Kingdom, where it was connected to the black exhaust air duct. “The practical DSHP extracts the exhaust air by the duct from the corner window of the office to the top of the DSHP, and then produces hot water and stores it in water tanks by absorbing heat from the exhaust air and outdoor air,” it stated.
The researchers found that the simulated DSHP system was able to provide an average working water outlet temperature of 56.28 C and a stable monthly simulated coefficient of performance (COP) between 2.69 and 3.03 throughout the year. “The simulative heating amount of the DSHP heating system was 9.85% higher than the practical result, while the simulative energy consumption was 6.36% lower than the practical result,” they said, referring to the differences they recorded between the simulated system and the practical one.
Their analysis also showed that, depending on the location, the proposed heat pump system is able to achieve annual heating bill savings ranging from 20.64% to 54.36% and annual carbon reductions spanning from 14.39% to 86.09%, compared to traditional gas boiler heating systems.
The system is presented in the paper “Eco-economic performance and application potential of a novel dual-source heat pump heating system,” published in Energy. The research group comprises academics from the University of Hull and the University of Science and Technology of China.

Tractebel is currently engaged in providing technical and economic analyses for factors such as land availability, solar project costs, siting, and development, all of which will be considered in upcoming auctions.
“We will support and advise on preparation of request for proposal (RFP) packages for independent power producer (IPP) and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC), plus the entire bidding process including contract negotiations,” the Belgium-based company said. “The mandate is expected to be completed in early 2024.”
The government of Pakistan's plan entails the installation of 6 GW of large-scale photovoltaic plants, 2 GW of medium-sized solar projects not exceeding 4 MW, and 1 GW of rooftop PV capacity.
In May 2022, the World Bank said that for Pakistan to achieve its clean energy goals, it needed to quickly introduce renewable energy auctions, which were approved by its energy regulator in 2017. The World Bank proposed a dual-track strategy, which involves identifying big renewable energy parks, primarily in the wind-rich provinces of Balochistan and Sindh, alongside smaller project capacities that can be auctioned near electricity substations with available capacity.
As outlined in the report, the generation capacity for the auctions should be in blocks of at least 50 MW, with slices ranging from 300 MW to 600 MW within the large parks. Tariffs should be determined no later than 33 weeks after the start of each auction process. The maximum bid price for each auction should be established with reference to previous exercises, and resulting power purchase agreements (PPAs) should span 20 to 25 years.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Pakistan had an installed solar power capacity of around 1.24 GW by the close of 2022.

Under the terms of the partnership, Posco will develop and construct the BIPV materials while East-West Power will test the new products under real conditions at several sites.
The BIPV panels used in the new building material would rely on PosMac, a special steel manufactured by Posco, that is being used instead of glass on the panels' backside. This innovation is expected to solve the typical challenges of BIPV applications based on glass-glass modules, creating a strong integration of the modules with a building's structure.
“PosMAC features the highest corrosion resistance of all galvanized steels in the world,” Posco claims. “The coating layer consisting of three elements – magnesium, zinc and aluminum- delivers 5 to 10 times higher corrosion resistance than regular galvanized steel.”
According to the manufacturer, PosMac is particularly suitable for manufacturing electronics and automotive uses, as well as for marine solar panels that are susceptible to severe environmental conditions.
Posco said this new BIPV technology may also be used for applications in agrivoltaics or rooftop PV, without providing further technical details. “PosMAC has proven to be inevitable in building advanced structures which is the backbone of generating sustainable solar energy and bringing agricultural advancement,” the company said in a statement issued in 2018.

Switzerland-based Synhelion and Mexican construction materials supplier Cemex have started building a high-concentration solar tower designed to produce synthetic fuels for a cement production facility near Madrid, Spain.
“This is an exciting milestone for everyone involved, achieved through the excellent collaboration between the teams of Cemex and Synhelion,” said Synhelion CEO, Gianluca Ambrosetti.
Ambrosetti said that the facility will provide enough heat to produce “clinker” concrete without using fossil fuels.
“Clinker is produced in a rotary kiln at temperatures nearing 1,500 C. Fossil fuels are typically used to heat the kiln and are responsible for approximately 40% of direct CO2 emissions,” the company claims. “Additionally, the technology creates the conditions to separate, and therefore capture, the remaining CO2 from calcination in concentrated form without additional efforts.”
Synhelion's solar tower technology captures energy from a field of solar mirrors, concentrating it onto a receiver atop the tower to convert solar radiation into high-temperature process heat. This heat is then directed to a thermal chemical reactor that generates syngas, a blend of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2).
The syngas undergoes processing through standard gas-to-liquids technology to create fuels like jet fuel, gasoline, or diesel. Excess heat is stored in a thermal energy storage (TES) unit for continuous 24/7 operation.
Synhelion and Cemex introduced the first solar clinker production in a small-scale pilot process in early 2022.
“From the pilot installation, we foresee completing our first small-scale industrial plant in Móstoles by 2026,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “We also expect to complete our first large-scale industrial plant, with a capacity of 150 MWth, by the end of the decade.”
Synhelion and Cemex have secured $3.2 million in funding from the US Department of Energy to study the conditions needed to maximize heat transfer to the raw cement mix. Sandia National Laboratories helped the Swiss company to develop the concept.

AEMO Services, which is administering the tender process in its capacity as the New South Wales (NSW) Consumer Trustee in Australia, has announced the number of bidders participating in its third tender to secure renewable projects. It aims to transform its coal-reliant energy system have significantly exceeded indicative targets for both generation and long-duration storage.
The tender was targeting 950 MW of generation and 550 MW of long-duration (at least eight hours) storage, but AEMO Services said it received offers totalling 3.1 GW of new generation capacity and 1.6 GW of long-duration storage.
AEMO Services Chair Paul Moy said the result reflects the scale of investor interest in the NSW energy transition and demonstrates the appeal of the long-term energy service agreements (LTESAs) that the state government is offering as it seeks to implement its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.
Successful projects will be awarded LTESAs that provide a floor price for output, which Moy said allows for greater investment certainty for developers.
“The strong support is further evidence that the long-term energy service agreements provided through our tender process addresses a key market risk that might otherwise delay or discourage investors from participating in the transition,” he said. “Combined, the bids for generation represent a total capacity of 3.1 GW, against an indicative target of 950 MW for this tender, and bids for long-duration storage represent a total capacity of 1.6 GW, against a target of up to 550 MW.”
Moy said more than half of the projects in the current tender round were submitted in the first tender round, the results of which were announced in May.
“We designed our processes to minimise time and effort for repeat bidders, allowing participants to sharpen their pencils and return with an improved proposition,” he said. “At the same time, it’s a positive sign that a number of new entrants have engaged with the process, demonstrating confidence in our systems and product and an evolving pipeline of projects.”
This tender round is the second for generation and long-duration storage and the third in a rolling schedule that will continue over the next 10 years. The state is also seeking offers for a minimum of 380 MW of shorter duration firming capacity (at least two hours of storage) as it rolls out its energy transition strategy.
The roadmap sets out a path to bring at least 12 GW of renewable energy generation capacity and 2 GW of long-duration storage online by 2030 to replace aging coal-fired power stations. All of the remaining coal-fired power stations in New South Wales are set to close by 2040 at the latest, with Origin’s 2,880 MW Eraring power station in the Hunter region the next to go with its close scheduled for August 2025.
AEMO Services Executive General Manager Paul Verschuer said the competing bids in this tender round will now undergo an assessment.
“If we aren’t satisfied that there are enough competing projects we can alter our plan accordingly and tender for a higher volume in future rounds,” he said. “Likewise, if we do see sufficient value we can increase the amount of energy supported. In our first tender, this approach produced a line-up of successful projects willing to build the necessary energy generating infrastructure, while putting much less consumer money at risk than traditional CFD’s (contracts for difference) by contracting LTESA strike prices 40% below the levelized cost of energy.”
Successful proponents from the tender round are expected to be announced by the end of this year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/07/including-flood-erosion-hazards-in-solar-project-site-selection/,"INSTALLATIONS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,MIDDLE EAST,TURKEY",LIOR KAHANA,"AUGUST 7, 2023","Including flood, erosion hazards in solar project site selection","A group of researchers in Turkey has developed a new model to include flood and erosion risk to PV project siting.
The scientists claim that fixed-distance buffer zones are not sufficient to protect solar farms from flood and erosion hazards, stressing that determining a certain distance from dams currently still lacks a scientific basis.
“When we initially delved into articles related to the optimal site selection of PV plants, we couldn't help but wonder why floods were either ignored or only briefly mentioned in most of them,” Kutay Yılmaz, corresponding author, told pv magazine. “Some previous studies suggested buffer zones ranging from 100 m to 1, 000 m to mitigate reservoir-related damages, but this approach seemed somewhat imprecise to us. Given the increasing occurrence of hydrological extremes in recent years, we felt it was necessary to adopt a more rigorous approach,” said Yilmaz.
In their study “Exploring flood and erosion risk indices for optimal solar PV site selection and assessing the influence of topographic resolution,” published in Renewable Energy, they provide a method for quantitatively assessing potential flood hazards near planned solar farms and establish six levels of flood hazards based on flow depths and flood velocities with three of the highest classes being structurally unsafe for solar PV.
For their modeling, the academics utilized the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which is a decision-making technique based on hierarchical decomposition for organizing and prioritizing decision criteria. “AHP facilitates the resolution of complex issues that involve inputs that cannot be compared with one another, typically due to the use of different measurement units,” they explained. “Through the use of AHP, a solution model that employs homogeneous factors is developed from the original problem.”
As for erosion risk, the scientists utilized the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) approach, which considers factors such as rainfall-erosivity, soil sensitivity to erosion, and topographic features. “Erosion is a natural hazard that poses a significant risk to the structural integrity of various installations, including PV systems,” the paper notes. “To translate the erosion results into actionable insights for site selection, the severity of erosion is categorized into different classes.”
The scientists also used digital elevation models (DEMs), which are digital cartographic datasets representing a continuous topographic elevation surface to determine the distance to roads, transmission lines, and other factors. They also utilized the DEMs to analyze the influence of topographic resolution on flood and erosion hazards, and found that a lower resolution (34-meter) may provide as good results as a higher resolution (25-meter) for PV project site selection.
“It is noteworthy that the calculation process involved in determining the distance to roads, transmission lines, and other factors requires the use of DEMs,” they explained. “The study demonstrates that low-resolution topographic data can be used for site selection, provided that the data is resampled to the resolution of land use data.”
“Those results are intriguing, as even though the weights of flood and erosion in the AHP were relatively low, their impact on site selection was substantial,” said Kutay. “As we move forward, we will also consider other global-warming related criteria like sea level rise and flash precipitation, tailoring our approach to the specific characteristics and needs of each location.”

Researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Sydney have modeled disruptive solar generation ramps, caused by cloud cover and seasonal cycles. Their research reveals significant changes in magnitude, frequency, and duration over the next century, and this could potentially jeopardize the stability of Australia's energy network.
The study “Assessing Australia’s future solar power ramps with climate projections,” published in Scientific Reports, shows that ramp events that result in sudden increases or decreases in output are likely to become longer and more frequent, particularly across the east coast and parts of northern Australia.
The modeling indicates up to 5% changes in future ramp frequency and periods when compared to the historical baseline. Sudden variability can lead to mismatches between electricity supply and demand, which, if unmanaged, can cause power outages or complete grid failures.
With Australia increasing its reliance on large-scale solar, the researchers said the findings underscore the importance of designers of utility scale solar plants including an appropriate storage facility to manage curtailment and energy deficit periods to maintain a supply-demand ratio.
“This work highlights the importance of considering future changes in climate when designing large-scale solar farms to ensure the incorporation of frequency control devices and storage plans for a reliable power supply,” they said. “Further, it is of utmost importance to consider the future changes in the intermittency and ramp features due to climate change while selecting optimal locations for deploying future PV plants.”
Lead author, Shukla Poddar, said weather-induced variability in solar power generation can lead to mismatches between electricity supply and demand, which, if unmanaged, can cause power outages or complete grid failures.
“Solar PV generation is affected by climate factors, which makes it susceptible to climate change,” she said. “For example, changes to the way clouds pass over solar panels could cause sudden decreases (ramp-downs) or increases (ramp-ups) that can cause voltage fluctuations and blackouts.”
