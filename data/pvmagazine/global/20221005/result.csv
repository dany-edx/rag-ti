In order for solar to continue its impressive growth, we need to make sure that it is profitable for larger entities to continue to grow their solar portfolios.
One obvious path to making this a reality, is in establishing better centralized services for solar investors. This may sound counterintuitive, as solar is often applauded for its decentralized aspects, but it is this decentralization that necessitates better centralized services, especially when dealing with multiple plants.
In the early years of solar PV’s rollout, dealing with a single utility scale plant was a significant undertaking. Typically, maintenance operations would take place on a set schedule, with little known about the health or performance of the plant save for blatantly obvious issues. Now, solar O&M is a much more advanced field, and when used properly, can greatly streamline and improve the process of owning and operating multiple PV plants.
One of the most obvious ways in which this can occur is from the gathering and utilization of data. Now more than ever, we live in a data driven society. An organization that is failing to capture and utilize data effectively is one that is falling behind its competition.
In solar O&M, the availability of valuable data has increased greatly in recent years. One way in which we have gone about improving our data collection is through the use of autonomous drones. In fact, to kickstart the expansion of our datasets we acquired Heliolytics, an industry leader in aerial drone imaging.
Utilizing overhead imaging in solar PV plants means that AI can be used to quickly analyze thermal images to identify any faults in solar arrays. One of the most important benefits here is that it also allows plant operators to make more informed decisions on when to physically service plants – sending out workers when they are actually needed, rather than based on an arbitrary schedule.
In order to gain the full benefit of this newly available data, especially when dealing with multiple plants, it is also necessary for a robust platform to aggregate and analyze it. And actually, as plant owners bring more assets online, these platforms bring even more value, as site visits can be coordinated between multiple closely located plants.
Our sunstreams platform is our solution for collecting, analyzing, and utilizing data to empower our customers. We believe platforms such as this will become one of the key cogs in the overall utility scale solar PV machine. Ultimately what needs to happen to ensure growth occurs at the pace necessary, is that it needs to be an easy process for a large entity to handle multiple plants.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/05/perovskite-solar-cell-using-copper-electrode-hits-20-1-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 5, 2022",Perovskite solar cell with copper electrode hits 20.1% efficiency,"Scientists from the Beijing Institute of Technology have developed a solar cell with a back electrode made of copper (Cu) instead of silver (Ag) or gold (Au).
“Cu as an earth-abundant element is the promising candidate to be an electrode for its comparable physical properties with Au and Ag and exhibits good stability with simultaneously low cost,” the research group said. “It costs less than 1/80th that of Ag and 1/5,500th that of Au” Zhou said. “Cu is the promising candidate to be PSC electrode for its comparable physical properties (i.e. conductivity) with Au and Ag, and good stability.”
The solar cell has a planar n-i-p structure and consists of an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, a perovskite layer, a hole transport layer (HTL), and a layer made of copper. The researchers adjusted the fermi level of the HTL to match both the perovskite and the Cu electrode. They used a solution based on poly(triaryl)amine (PTAA), which is a hole-transporting and electron-blocking material, as well as a Spiro-OMeTAD precursor. The fermi level is the maximum kinetic energy of an electron at 0 Kelvin.
In the proposed HTL configuration, the energy difference at the HTL/Cu interface can be reduced to improve carrier transportation.
“Just like the buckets effect, we hope both perovskite/HTL and HTL/Cu interfaces are not the shortest buckets during device operation,” said the researchers. “The balanced energy difference between perovskite/HTL and HTL/Cu interfaces could significantly improve the charge collection and transport properties in the resultant n-i-p perovskite solar cell devices.”
Under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 20.10%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.084 V, and a fill factor of 78.77%, which the research team describes as the highest efficiency ever achieved in n-i-p solar cells with Cu electrode. The device was also able to retain 92% of its initial efficiency after 1,000 hours.
“This finding not only extends the understanding on the band alignment of neighboring semiconductor functional layer in the device architecture to improve the resulting performance, but also suggests great potential of Cu electrode for application in PSCs community,” the academics said.
They presented their work in “Balancing Energy-Level Difference for Efficient n-i-p Perovskite Solar Cells with Cu Electrode,” which was recently published in Energy Material Advances.
“The present work not only expanded our knowledge on seeking a balanced band alignment at different interfaces to improve the performance of devices but also ensured the application of Cu electrode in further perovskite solar cell industrialization,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/05/utility-scale-hybrid-wind-solar-in-turkey/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,TURKEY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 5, 2022","Utility-scale hybrid wind, solar in Turkey","Asunim, an Ankara-based renewable energy developer, has revealed plans to build two solar parks in Turkey, close to two existing wind farms owned by Sancak Energy.
The two solar projects will have a combined capacity of 42 MW and will be one of Turkey’s largest hybrid wind-solar projects to date.
“There is a regulation introduced by the Turkish government in June 2021 which allows combining any energy production source with a secondary source which can be wind or solar,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The target here is to take advantage of the secondary source when there is no possibility to produce electricity from the primary source.”
The size limit for the secondary source is the AC limit of the primary source, according to the rules.
“For example, if you have a wind power plant of 100 MW, you can build a solar power plant of up to 100 MW,” the spokesperson said. “The solar facility will come into operation when the wind plant can not supply 100 MW AC at that moment so the solar park will fill the gap between the cap which is 100 MW and the actual production.”
Asunim will connect a 26 MW solar power plant with the 103.2 MW Bağlar wind farm, which went online in 2018, and a 16 MW solar array with the 52.8 MW Yahyalı Eolic power plant, which started generating electricity in 2015.
“Sancak Energy has shown us its full confidence in all processes of the project, from engineering to design, from procurement to installation, from construction and commissioning to long-term operation and maintenance,” the company said. “In this project type, which we call full EPC, we will manage the whole process. In this sense, we are breaking new ground for wind-solar hybrid projects in Turkey.”
The company said the the main challenge will be the application of its HPPC (Hybrid Power Plant Controller) software, which calculates how much solar should be produced. It also measures the reactive power and balance between solar and wind, as well as the harmonics.
“This is quite a complex job to do and Asunim already has the know-how from previous projects such as Juba project which is located in South Sudan and combines solar with fossil fuel gen-sets,” the spokesperson said.
Another challenge is provided by the irregular terrains where the wind power plants are located.
“Asunim design experts use 3D modeling programs to calculate mm by mm the shade effect and make a tailor-made project even at the most difficult terrains, so this challenge is also being met by technical and engineering capacity,” said the spokesperson.
The company claims that the two projects will achieve a significantly lower levelized cost of energy (LCOE).
“The main reduction factors on the solar project costs are achieved by connecting on an existing grid connection point and already leased land, improving the overall economy of the wind power profile by hybridization,” the spokesperson said. “The LCOE is reduced considerably due to adding more power and cheap source of power to an existing investment. When there is sun there is less wind and when there is less sun there is more wind so both technologies meet each other.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/05/south-africa-unveils-bids-for-sixth-renewables-procurement-round/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,SOUTH AFRICA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 5, 2022",South Africa unveils bids for sixth renewables procurement round,"South Africa's Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme Office has published a list of the 56 bids it has received for the sixth round of the nation's Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP).
About 4.1 GW of wind, spanning 23 projects, and 5.5 GW of solar at 33 sites will be allowed to participate. The wind farms range in size from 80 MW to 140 MW and the planned solar parks range from 75 MW to 240 MW. The proposed solar projects are located in Northern Cape, Western Cape, North West, Free State, and Limpopo provinces.
In September, the South African government raised its total capacity allocation from 3.6 GW to 4.2 GW. However, the quota for solar remained unchanged at 1 GW, while the wind quota has been raised from 2.6 GW to 3.2 GW.
“It’s encouraging to see continued interest in South Africa’s REIPPPP from IPPs in addition to the growth in the private market now that license requirements for large projects have been removed,” Blue Horizon Energy Consulting Services’ Chris Ahlfeldt tells pv magazine. “It’s surprising to see only 1 GW of the 4.2 GW allocation coming from solar PV in Round 6, considering it provides some of the least expensive electricity and Eskom continues regularly loadshedding during the daytime hours. South Africa needs steady annual demand of about 3 GW per year to justify significant new investment in local solar PV manufacturing, so local manufacturers will have to look to also supply to non-utility scale market segments to justify manufacturing in the country.”
The nation's latest procurement exercise is part of a plan to tender almost 12 GW of capacity and follows the recent publication of South Africa’s new Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). The IRP aims for up to 6 GW of new large-scale solar by 2030, as well as up to 6 GW of distributed-generation PV capacity.

Meyer Burger Technology AG has revealed plans to raise CHF 250 million ($255.2 million) via an ordinary capital increase, by issuing new subscription rights. It aims to use the funds to rapidly expand production to 3 GW, and is set to vote on the plan at its extraordinary general meeting on Oct. 28.
The Switzerland-based solar module manufacturer recently sealed a supply agreement with US project developer DE Shaw Renewable Investments (DESRI). The agreement states that Meyer Burger will supply 3.75 GW to 5 GW of heterojunction solar modules to DESRI over a period of five years from 2024. The contract includes a fixed basic price, with a possible adjustment to wafer prices.
The company's board mainly wants to finance the planned expansion of production capacity for its solar cells and modules. The CHF 250 million will support the expansion of heterojunction cell production in Thalheim, Germany, and the development of module production at the company's US site in Arizona.
More than 40,000 square meters of additional space will be available in Thalheim for the new cell production facilities. And the company expects the first module deliveries from its Arizona plant to start in mid-2024.
The company is also hoping to benefit from political momentum. Europe's Fit for 55 package and REPowerEU Plan, as well as the US Inflation Reduction Act, could help to drive the development of the solar industry. Meyer Burger believes it is positioned to benefit from these trends, as it is one of the few established PV cell and module manufacturers with production outside of Asia.
Meyer Burger is targeting around 3 GW of new annual production capacity by the end of 2024, including 1.4 GW of module production capacity in Freiberg, Germany. In the USA, the expansion of around 1 GW of module production capacity is planned. While Meyer Burger focuses more on the sale of heterojunction modules for rooftop systems in Europe, in the United States, it is focusing on the large-scale segment.
In Freiberg, the company now has an annual production capacity of 400 MW and is ramping up its second production line. The ramp-up started as planned in September and after completion, 1 GW of production capacity will be available. Additional expansion to 1.4 GW has already started.

The owner and operator Australia’s two biggest batteries, Neoen, is close to switching on its third installation in Canberra.
The so-called “Capital Battery” will be owned by Neoen and financed through a combination of company equity and loans from infrastructure fund manager Infradebt, as well as Clean Energy Finance Corp. (CEFC). It is the third investment that the CEFC has made in Neoen’s Australian big batteries.
The battery is set to deliver grid support services to the network, presumably through what’s known as virtual synchronous machines, or grid-forming inverters, Neoen said. Such tech gives batteries the capacity to help stabilize the grid by providing inertia.
This is something the company’s 150 MW/193.5 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve began doing at scale in July, following two years of trials.
The Capital Battery is Neoen’s first project with South Korean technology partner Doosan. The two big batteries Neoen already operates, the 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery near Geelong, and the Hornsdale Power Reserve have both used Tesla technology. The Doosan partnership was announced shortly after the Victorian Big Battery caught fire during commissioning.
Neoen has also signed a 70 MW “virtual battery contract” with AGL Energy. Neoen described the new, seven-year contract as a financial agreement and a hedging tool.
“The virtual battery [agreement] is an innovative solution designed by Neoen to allow a large electricity user or retailer to mimic a grid-scale battery, without having to build or own one,” Neoen said. “This highly flexible solution provides AGL Energy with the ability to hedge its customer load by virtually charging and discharging a battery of 70 MW as and when it chooses.”
Neoen said it hopes the virtual battery concept will become one of its core products in the future.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/05/iron-air-battery-startup-nets-450-million-investment/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 5, 2022",Iron-air battery startup nets $450 million investment,"From pv magazine USA
Solar and wind power have intermittency in their productive hours, as multi-day weather events can affect output. Therefore, cost-effective, multi-day storage is an important feature in grid reliability.
Boston-based startup Form Energy has developed multi-day iron-air batteries to address this need. The company said its batteries can store renewables-sourced electricity for 100 hours at system costs that are competitive with conventional power plants. At full-scale production, Form Energy said the modules would deliver electricity at about one-tenth the cost of lithium-ion batteries.
The iron-air battery is composed of cells filled with thousands of iron pellets that are exposed to air and create rust. The oxygen is then removed, reverting the rust to iron. Controlling this process allows the battery to be charged and discharged.
The technology has garnered significant interest from investors. Most recently, it raised $450 million in a Series E funding round led by TPG Rise Climate. Also joining the Series E round are GIC and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), along with existing investors ArcelorMittal, Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), Capricorn Investment Group, Coatue, Energy Impact Partners (EIP), MIT’s The Engine, NGP ETP, Temasek, Prelude Ventures, and VamosVentures.
“The development of reliable, long duration energy storage technology is critical for the global transition to renewable energy,” said Leon Pedersen, managing director of CPP Investments. “By introducing new storage solutions to the market, Form Energy can contribute to the energy transition process while also providing attractive risk-adjusted returns for the CPP Fund.”
The technology is less energy-dense than its lithium-ion counterparts, making it a better fit for large grid-scale applications. This may come as an advantage for the company, as EV batteries are in competition for lithium, a metal with geo-political mining concerns and battery fire risks.
The battery modules are grouped together in environmentally protected enclosures. Hundreds of these enclosures are grouped together in modular megawatt-scale power blocks. Depending on the system size, tens to hundreds of these power blocks can be connected to the electricity grid. For scale, in its least dense configuration, a one megawatt system comprises half an acre of land. Higher density configurations would achieve >3 mw/acre.
The company’s first project is a 1 MW/150 MWh pilot installation with Minnesota-based utility Great River Energy. Form Energy said it expects to have the facility deployed at a Great River Energy power plant by 2023.
“Form was founded with a unified mission to develop a multi-day energy storage battery that would unlock the power of extremely low-cost renewable energy to transform the electric grid,” said Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo. “Over the last five years, through rigorous R&D and product engineering, our 100-hour iron-air battery product is ready to scale. The Series E funding will accelerate our ability to responsibly build a globally competitive US battery manufacturing supply chain and advance American innovation.”
Form Energy said it is currently engaged in a site selection process for its first full scale battery manufacturing facility. Starting with identifying over 100 initial sites across 16 states, the company said it has narrowed the site selection to three states, and expects to make an announcement before the end of the year.
The funding round builds on last year’s $200 million in Series D funding. This round was led by $25 million from ArcelorMittal’s XCarb innovation fund. ArcelorMittal will non-exclusively supply the iron materials for the battery system production, and Form Energy said it intends to source its iron domestically, manufacturing the batteries near where the iron was sourced.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/05/solar-powered-synthetic-kerosene-could-be-vital-bridge-to-zero-emission-flying/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE",MAX HALL,"OCTOBER 5, 2022",Solar-powered synthetic kerosene could be vital bridge to zero-emission flying,"The European Parliament has released a new report on the critical role to be played by synthetic kerosene in achieving sustainable flying.
Synthetic kerosene is a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) derived from renewables-powered green hydrogen, which offers greater carbon emission reduction potential than the advanced biofuels which complete the range of SAFs. With the EU's European Green Deal targeting aviation emission reductions of 89% by mid century, SAFs are set to be a bridge technology before hydrogen-fueled and electric aircraft become a genuine proposition, according to the report commissioned by the parliament's committee on transport and tourism.
SAFs offer no emission reductions when burned in aircraft, but they offer emissions savings during their production, from the carbon absorption of their feedstock material in the case of advanced biofuels.
The “Investment scenario and roadmap for achieving aviation green deal objectives by 2050” study envisages hydrogen and electric aircraft as holding the long-term answer. However, it also says that they are unlikely to be widely available before the 2030-40 period, which is “too late to be the main methods for decarbonizing aviation.”
In fact, industry insiders told the paper's authors that electric aircraft would be more likely to enter operation in 2035, rather than the 2030 date suggested. There was a similar lag in expectation, to 2040, for hydrogen-powered flight. Until more advanced tech becomes available, SAFs offer a more immediate emissions-reduction option, as they can be mixed with the kerosene that powers jet aircraft today.
The European Commission, under its proposed RefuelEU Aviation regulation, wants the bloc to mandate a minimum 2% of SAFs in jet aircraft fuel in 2025, rising to 63% in mid century. Recognizing the greater emission reduction value of synthetic kerosene over cheaper advanced biofuels, the EU executive said at least 0.7% of all SAFs in the bloc in 2030 should be synthetic fuel options, rising to 28% in 2050.
The 149-page report noted regulators will have to encourage the production of synthetic kerosene to avoid airlines instead opting for advanced biofuels and must also encourage home-grown production, given most of the SAFs available in the EU at present are imported. That regulatory role will be even more important to persuade the air travel industry to invest in SAFs now, rather than hold off until they are replaced by hydrogen and electric aircraft, the study added.
To achieve the technological leaps required for low-emission aviation – including new aircraft designs and more efficient air traffic management measures – the report made policy recommendations including the use of income from aviation emissions trading, and from any future aviation fuel tax, to support R&D.
The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation established by UN body the International Civil Aviation Organization should be brought more in line with the EU Emissions Trading System, to focus on more than offsetting flight-related emissions, according to the report. The document's authors said the EU should drive SAF production and the availability of hydrogen infrastructure and should regulate SAFs to encourage investment and the prioritization of their production methods for aviation purposes.
The EU taxonomy of sustainable investments – which was controversially amended to include gas and nuclear this year – should also be “carefully” extended to include investment in sustainable flying, according to the report. The report estimated that €50.4 billion must be spent to develop the necessary tech and a further €378 billion to deploy it. With fuel savings of an estimated €395 billion available to mid century, however, the total bill would come in at a net €33 billion, according to the paper.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/05/eu-member-states-could-use-emergency-energy-measures-to-penalize-solar/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",MAX HALL,"OCTOBER 5, 2022",EU member states could use emergency energy measures to penalize solar,"SolarPower Europe has voiced concern about the possible “patchwork implementation” of the emergency energy measures agreed by the European Commission and European Council last week.
When the commission originally proposed a cap on revenue earned by solar generators, and other cheap-to-operate power plants, SolarPower Europe has called for such a measure to be applied uniformly across the bloc. That may have reflected a fear that less solar-friendly European member states would be ready to exploit any opportunity to penalize renewables more harshly than other “infra-marginal” generators, such as operators of lignite power plants or nuclear reactors.
However, the measures agreed last week between the commission and the council – made up of member state energy ministers – paid no heed to the call for uniformity. The measures about to be set down in EU law, and which will apply until June 30, accord member states the freedom to vary the level of the €0.18/kWh revenue cap suggested by the commission and, crucially, to discriminate between different low-marginal-cost generation technologies.
“The final text preserves the main elements of the commission proposal while addressing the concerns of member states and providing flexibility where necessary,” said European Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson.
SolarPower Europe urged member states to stick to the €0.18/kWh revenue ceiling proposed and to apply it, on a monthly basis, only to “net market revenues” recorded by generators, after hedging and other costs have been applied.
The revenue cap has been proposed because Europe's electricity market sets prices across the board pegged to the most expensive source of power bid in the auctions held to meet demand. With gas prices having soared since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, the EU says the owners of power plants which have very low operating costs – such as solar projects – have benefited to an excessive extent.
The industry has countered by pointing out that the price of solar electricity is usually agreed well in advance of delivery, rather than sold on the day-to-day spot market, so the record gas price has yet to filter through to clean power company balance sheets.
In responding to the emergency energy measures, SolarPower Europe also said it is time for the EU authorities to accord the same emergency status to the continent's urgent need to roll out renewables as it had done to keeping the lights on. Referring to the article 122 emergency procedure under which the commission and council rushed through last week's package, SolarPower Europe said the commission should draft an emergency plan for boosting clean power and bring it to the council this year.
