One of these projects is a 37 MW solar plant built by Singapore-based renewable energy developer Vena Energy in Kawakami, a village located at an altitude of 1,185m in Japan's Nagano prefecture.
The Kawakami Solar Project was built under Japan's feed-in tariff scheme with around 89,000 bifacial photovoltaic solar panels on a surface of 49.87 hectares.

“The Kawakami Solar Project is our first renewable energy project in the Nagano prefecture and we are grateful to our host communities for their support,” said Juan Mas Valor, head of Vena Energy Japan. “With its completion, Vena Energy now operates a total of 26 solar and wind projects, totaling 516 MW across Japan.”
Japan-based engineering company Airu has provided construction works for the facility.
Land scarcity and grid congestion were recently pointed out by the International Renewable Energy Agency as the two main reasons behind the limited success of Japan's six solar auctions and the high costs of PV installations in the Japanese market. Furthermore, the agency reported it is difficult to secure permits for a solar park above 40 MW in size in Japan, as there is a long approval process which comes on top of high land costs and grid congestion.

The fifth round of the nation’s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP), the results of which were announced on October 28, allocated 25 solar and wind power projects with a total generation capacity of 2,583 MW, and French renewables financial advisory Finergreen has reported Mainstream secured a dozen of them.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
Those project wins included six of the 13 solar farms allocated, with a combined generation capacity of 450 MW. Mainstream agreed to accept a significantly lower tariff for the solar energy its projects will generate, at ZAR0.37479/kWh ($0.025), than fellow successful solar bidders Engie, Scatec and TotalEnergies–Mulilo. French energy firm Engie will sell solar power from its three projects (total capacity 225 MW) for ZAR0.47517/kWh ($0.03169); Norwegian developer Scatec – which said it had secured 273 MW of solar capacity at the time but which Finergreen reported won 225 MW across three solar farms – bid a tariff of ZAR0.4846 ($0.03232); and the joint bid by French business TotalEnergies and Cape Town-based developer Mulilo will receive ZAR0.47545/kWh ($0.03171) for the energy generated by the partners' planned 75 MW solar farm.
Based on the bidding results announced by South Africa's Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, Mainstream's solar project wins are thought to be six 75 MW arrays in the Tokologo administrative area of the Lejweleputswa district of Free State. The solar-rich Northern Cape secured only two PV projects, with a generation capacity of 150 MW. Chris Ahlfeldt, an energy specialist at Cape Town-based Blue Horizon Energy Consulting Services told pv magazine when the results were announced, that grid constraints afflicting electric utility Eskom limited options for solar in that region.
Scatec's three projects appear to be in the Western Cape, and the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal regions failed to allocate any solar projects, although both secured wind facilities in the procurement exercise.
With its wind farms capacity added in, Mainstream secured 1,274 MW of clean power generation capacity in the auction, which will earn it a weighted average ZAR0.41217 ($0.02749) per kilowatt-hour generated.
The average solar tariff secured in the bidding – ZAR0.43104/kWh ($0.02875) – was 51% lower than the price quoted in the last planned round of the national procurement program, which was abandoned in November 2015.
The first round of the REIPPPP program, held in November 2011, secured 1,426 MW of renewables generation capacity across a record 28 projects, to attract a record $6.2 billion of investment. Round two, four months later, allocated 1,040 MW of capacity across 19 projects worth $4.2 billion. Some 17 clean power facilities were awarded in round three, in August 2013, for 1,457 of generation capacity – the highest volume awarded until the latest round – for an investment of $4.5 billion. A 200 MW supplementary round in March 2014 allocated 17 projects for an investment of $1.8 billion, and a $2 billion exercise in August 2014 allocated 13 projects with a generation capacity of 1,121 MW.

The commission has drafted its second annual summary of the state of competitiveness of various European renewables technologies, to advise EU counterparts the European Parliament and the European Council of high ranking member states ministers.
Pick up the November edition of pv magazine to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyber attacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
The document, published on the EU's law website on October 26, highlighted the bloc's global leader status in terms of solar R&D, polysilicon production, PV project operations and maintenance, and the manufacturing of balance-of-system components such as inverters and trackers.
The commission warned, however, the bloc has fallen to third in the list of markets for “high-value innovation” in solar, supplanted by South Korea in the last year or so, and is due to “soon” fall behind China too, with Japan set to maintain its global lead.
The glaring imbalances in solar production were highlighted by the estimate the 12.8% of the market held by Europe – and worth €7.4 billion, in 2019 – was almost entirely down to poly production. With Europe's solar module exports having been stagnant for years, the volume of imported modules, from China and other Asian countries, had risen to represent a trade deficit of €5.7 billion in 2019.
With a rising number of European cell manufacturing operations being announced, the commission document noted EU producers lead their U.S. and Chinese rivals when it comes to the volume of energy their panels will generate during their lifetime versus the energy required to create them; by lowest energy intensity; and by energy return on carbon input, with the latter reflecting the nature of the electricity used to power production processes.
While no-one in European solar will need reminding of how the industry lost its global manufacturing leadership to China, the commission warned the same process could occur in the global market for those heat pumps which are mainly aimed at heating homes and offices.
While Europe has a strong R&D base when it comes to heat pumps in general, the €249 million trade surplus ‘mainly-heating' devices brought to the bloc in 2015 had become a €40 million deficit last year.
In terms of heat-pump roll-out, the document pointed out a typical seasonal coefficient of three for the devices signifies a kilowatt-hour of electricity is required for each three kWh of heat they produce, ensuring heat pumps will only be cost-competitive in markets where the price of electricity is no more than three times more expensive than gas. The commission pointed out electricity prices range between 1.5 and 5.5 times more expensive than the fossil fuel across EU member states, an issue the executive aimed to address in July with its proposed amendment to the EU Energy Tax Directive, and by extending emissions trading into the buildings sector.
The big push the EU has made to foster lithium-ion battery manufacturing is set to see the bloc become the world's second biggest battery cell manufacturer in 2025, behind China, although that is likely to worsen dependence on critical raw materials such as cobalt, lithium, graphite, silicon, titanium, and niobium, as well as nickel, an input material which is more abundant but for which the EU still relies on around 56% of imports to meet demand. In solar manufacturing terms, the EU is already concerned about boron, gallium, germanium, and indium, particularly if its grand cell and module manufacturing plans are realized. The bloc is also dependent on Asian companies for its battery cell production line equipment.
The electric vehicle (EV) battery raw materials needs will only tighten if an expected fleet of more than 50 million EVs is on European roads at the end of the decade. That would at least offer a significant energy storage reserve for power grids, with the commission estimating the more than 2 million EVs in Europe last year already added up to more than 60 GWh of storage capacity.
On batteries, cost is still the chief concern, with grid scale stationary devices costing around €300-400/kWh and household systems – for which Germany has two-thirds of Europe's 2.3 GWh market – costing twice that. Halving those numbers will be critical for mass deployment of lithium-ion storage, the document stated.
Raw materials, again, were the main concern cited in relation to the EU's global standing in the green hydrogen market, with South African iridium and platinum and China's rare earth metals in the spotlight. With the EU having a strong research base when it comes to electrolyzer technology, the report said, the only limit on green hydrogen growth will be clean energy generation capacity, given each unit of the gas produced requires 1.5 units of green electricity.
That need for cheap solar and wind power could mean a focus on the Middle East and North Africa when it comes to synthetic transport fuels for uses in heavy goods vehicles, aviation and maritime, the commission observed, although the EU also has extensive legacy fossil fuel infrastructure in place which could be leveraged for more sustainable options.
This copy was amended on 15/11/21 to indicate heat pumps typically produce 3 kWh of heat for each kilowatt-hour of electricity consumed, rather than the one-for-one previously indicated.

The researchers profiled all the microbes they found on PV systems located in Sorocaba and Itatiba, in São Paulo state, through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which is commonly used to identify, classify, and measure the volume of microbes within complex biological mixtures such as environmental samples and gut samples. They also used PICRUSt, which is a bioinformatics software package designed to predict metagenome functional content.
“In view of their characteristics, the microorganisms identified have significant potential to be developed into products that entail long periods of exposure to sunlight, such as sunscreens and pigments for processed foods, chemicals, textiles, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, as well as more efficient detergents with antimicrobial action for cleaning the panels themselves,” the Brazilian group stated.
The composition of the microbes was found to be very similar to that found in similar experiments carried out in Spain and the United States, as well as in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. The micro-organism profiles identified by the academics are said to be consistent with the harsh environment represented by PV systems located in tropical regions. “The presence of stress genes in the predicted functional content was … preliminary evidence that microbes living there are a [possible] source of metabolites with biotechnological interest,” the research team further explained.
The scientists added, the presence of microbes is often detected in the dust that accumulates on the panels, and their role in reducing the modules' efficiency should be further investigated. “As a survival strategy, some bacteria cluster in biofilms that line the panels and reduce their capacity to capture solar radiation,” they emphasized.
The results of the analysis were published in the study Extremophilic taxa predominate in a microbial community of photovoltaic panels in a tropical region, published in FEMS Microbiology Letters, the official journal of the Federation of European Microbiology Societies.

India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has asked the dispute resolution committee (DRC) to look into commissioning extension requests for solar projects that are due for delivery before April 1, 2022.
The DRC will look into developers’ time extension requirements due to temporary disruptions in the supply of imported solar PV modules caused by factors such as the pandemic. The MNRE directive will apply to projects under entities such as Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI), NTPC, and NHPC, with scheduled commissioning dates before April 1, 2022.
Solar developers have sought extensions for project commissioning timelines due to a range of factors. Having examined the issue, MNRE said that projects scheduled for commissioning in the next five to six months will probably not be affected.

However, this will depend on the development of suitable solution-based ‘roll-to-roll’ processes, where the cell materials are continuously deposited onto a substrate as it moves between two rolls.
Most of the best-performing perovskite solar cells fabricated to date have been made using spin coating, which isn’t suitable for large surface areas or high-volume manufacturing. Other solution-based processes also struggle to replicate high efficiencies achieved on devices measuring a few centimeters at most to commercially relevant sizes.
Vapor-based deposition processes have achieved good results both for standalone perovskite solar cells and silicon tandem devices, having been used for many years to produce other types of thin-film solar cells. Developing processes to make solution-based perovskite cells at large-scale has proved challenging, but continues to be widely investigated thanks to its low-cost potential.
Scientists led by the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology looked to evaluate progress in developing such processes, and outline the key challenges that remain. Their work reveals a wide range of potential routes, each with its own set of challenges and potential advantages. Their full evaluation can be found in the paper Roll-to-roll manufacturing toward lab-to-fab-translation of perovskite solar cells, published in APL Materials.
The group outlines a long list of remaining challenges, noting that all should be considered together for the best overall results, when it comes to the effect each stage of processing has on the individual materials involved. “One issue that needs to be carefully investigated is the effect of various factors, such as [roll-to-roll] deposition methods modified from the [sheet-to-sheet] process, on the stability and mechanical durability: applied tension during processing, exerted pressure with the roller, and thermal expansion of layers and substrates,” they explain.
They further note that other cell layers such as the indium-tin oxide commonly used as a transparent electrode would need to be changed or optimized to suit both roll-to-roll processing and flexible applications. Despite the long list of challenges, the group appears optimistic that suitable processes will soon be developed. “By resolving the remaining issues of R2R production,” they conclude, “Perovskite solar cells can be commercialized in the near future via R2R processes, not only for outdoor power generation but also for niche applications, including indoor or portable applications.”

V2G technology is used to feed the energy stored in EV batteries back into national grids, which can help stabilize power supply during high-demand periods. In order to make this technology have a sufficient impact on grid operations, however, large deployment volumes are necessary.
With this in mind, the Norwegian team decided to undertake what they called a “conceptual exercise” and assumed that the entire energy demand of a sunny country, such as Spain, could be completely covered by distributed solar generation, and that the nation's entire fleet of 29.4 million road-going vehicles could, theoretically, switch to electric vehicle technology. “We chose Spain as a case study mainly because of its location in southern Europe, with relatively large amounts of solar radiation all year round,” the academics explained. “At higher latitudes, the sun-hours during winter months drastically decrease, making a pure PV-EV system unrealistic.”
Working with a Matlab-based model, they calculated the state of the charge (SOC) for the aggregated EV fleet with an hourly temporal resolution. The proposed system works as follows: if the solar power production is higher than the load, surplus is stored in EV batteries; if these batteries have reached a 100% SOC and PV generation is still higher than the load, the surplus is lost; if PV generation is lower than the load, the grid takes power from the EV batteries until a minimum of 10% SOC is reached; if both PV and the EV batteries are unable to supply the load, the result is what the scientists called a “failure hour.”
They also assumed that all the EVs are equipped with V2G, have a battery capacity of 100 kWh, and are connected to the power network when parked. At night, when PV is not operating, the country's power system is depending entirely on the electricity stored in the EV batteries. Through the modeling, the research group found that 3.45 billion m2 of PV systems would be necessary to build a 100% self-reliant energy system.
“The visionary conceptual study presented here shows that it is indeed theoretically possible to power a complete country like Spain solely by the use of photovoltaics (PV), and to balance the intermittency solely by using the battery capacity of a fully electric transport system and V2G technology,” the researchers concluded, noting that even with 2 billion m2 of PV systems, 79% self-reliance would be possible.
They also warned, however, that their findings should be taken as the basis for future research on energy systems based solely on renewable energy, adding that their work was based on three kinds of assumptions: technically unrealistic; technically feasible but not likely to occur; and technically feasible and likely to occur.
The details of the modeling can be found in the paper The pure PV-EV energy system – A conceptual study of a nationwide energy system based solely on photovoltaics and electric vehicles, published in Smart Energy.

The Turkish PV market is currently being driven by self-consumption and net-metered rooftop PV. Turkey introduced net metering in May 2020 and the market has responded by starting to shift away from the megawatt-sized projects which have traditionally dominated.
The Solar Energy Roadmap report published by the Turkish PV association in 2019 predicted the nation could install 38 GW of solar by 2030. A separate study, published by the Istanbul-based Shura Energy Transition Center, in May 2018, had predicted solar could pass 20 GW by 2026.

Gelion Technologies has announced a new partnership with Mayur Renewables, which aims to develop a renewable energy portfolio in Papua New Guinea.
The newly signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) will see Gelion supply Mayur Renewables, a division of Sydney-listed Mayur Resources, with its zinc-bromide Endure batteries. Gelion is currently bringing the Endure batteries to full commercialization. It is initially looking to deliver 100 MWh of energy storage to Mayur from 2022 to 2027.
“The heat-resistant Endure battery is ideal for conditions in PNG and we look forward to supplying Mayur with energy storage capability to support and boost their operations,” said Gelion CEO Andrew Grimes.
Mayur Renewables Managing Director Paul Mulder said Gelion can also support its nation-building vision for PNG.
“It’s fantastic to get in on the ground floor with Gelion, which has the technology and lower-installed cost to enable Mayur to increase renewable energy penetration at a faster rate than with existing technologies,” he said.
Gelion is marketing itself as a safer alternative to lithium-based battery chemistries. It wants to bring the Endure batteries into the market at a remarkably competitive $100 per kWh. It says its novel manufacturing approach and highly engineered design have allowed it to provide such a low-cost offering.
“Only 13% of PNG is electrified. Most of the current power generation capacity relies on diesel or heavy fuel oil, which is not sustainable in today’s energy market. Gelion’s robust and scalable zinc-bromide Endure batteries, coupled with large-scale solar energy could provide remote PNG communities with an affordable, renewable and robust solution for their energy needs,” said Mulder.
The partnership announcement follows the completion of a Mayur Renewables study for a Special Economic Zone in Papua New Guinea, where around 500 MW of solar could be installed. In terms of scale, that’s just shy of the island’s total installed power capacity, which sits at 580 MW. Mayur Renewables said the solar project would provide a source of renewable energy for its planned Central Cement & Lime project, while also provide electricity for other industrial users.

Oversizing renewable capacity and adding long-term storage are not the only ways to match renewable generation with electricity demand on a seasonal basis, according to a recent study by two researchers at the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
Their model showed that reducing average building energy usage by about 60% would be key to achieving the least-cost 100% renewable grid with building electrification. The cost-optimal amount of building energy savings ranged from 52% to 68% across five selected climate zones in the United States.
For each climate zone, the model also found the cost-optimal levels of renewable capacity, allowing for oversizing, as well as long-term storage capacity and battery capacity. The model also chose an optimal mix of solar and wind generation, based on solar costs of $1,900 to $2,500 per kilowatt, wind power costs of $1,400 to $1,900 per kilowatt, and transmission costs.
Optimal oversizing of renewable capacity to handle year-round energy needs would be 3.2 times annual electricity demand in a climate zone stretching from Kansas to New York, the model showed. Solar in this case would contribute 15% of total renewable capacity with wind contributing 85%. Oversizing renewable capacity is associated with curtailment during mild seasons.
In a climate zone from Texas to Florida, optimal oversizing of solar would be 1.4 times annual demand, with solar providing all renewable capacity.
The study modeled long-term storage as being hydrogen storage in caverns, and using fuel cells to convert the hydrogen back to electricity. It used a capital cost of $161/kWh capacity. Optimal long-term storage capacity in each climate zone, measured in kilowatt-hours, ranged from 1 to 5 times annual average daily kWh consumption.
The authors said that most long-duration storage technologies “are either geologically constrained or still underdeveloped.”
Costs of a building’s energy efficiency improvements were based on case study data points found through a literature search. The authors reported those results as being “robust:” if the actual costs were 50% lower or higher, then changes in the optimal amount of energy efficiency would be within 5% of the reported results.Battery storage was modeled based on a capital cost of $380/kWh. Optimal battery storage capacity in each climate zone, measured in kilowatt-hours, ranged from 0.1 to 0.8 times annual average daily consumption.
The study also assessed the technical potential of buildings’ load flexibility, such as flexible air conditioning control, and building-sited thermal storage either in ice or in high-temperature ceramic brick. Load flexibility associated with such measures had the technical potential of reducing daily storage requirements by anywhere from 37% to 81%.
The authors said that many U.S. states, cities, and municipalities are developing plans to shift to 100% renewable energy.
The study, titled “Optimal strategies for a cost-effective and reliable 100% renewable electric grid,” was conducted by Sammy Houssainy and William Livingood, both with NREL.
