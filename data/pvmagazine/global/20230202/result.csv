Dipoles, which are molecules with opposite charges on the ends, are commonly used in solar research for interfacial engineering strategies in organic and perovskite solar cells.
The scientists built the solar cell with an active area of 9.6 mm2 and a p-i-n structure, which means the perovskite cell material is deposited onto the hole transport layer, and then coated with the electron transport layer, unlike with conventional n-i-p device architecture. Inverted perovskite solar cells typically show strong stability, but lag behind conventional devices in terms of conversion efficiency and cell performance.
The researchers said that dipoles on the perovskite surface can suppress ion migration, while facilitating interfacial charge extraction and enhancing hydrophobicity. They used a type of dipole known as b-pV2F and said it enabled a more compact perovskite film with an enlarged grain size of around 480 nm.
“Atomic force microscopy images showed that b-pV2F reduced the surface roughness from 54.4 to 41.1 nm, which is expected to ameliorate coverage with charge-transporting layers,” they said.
The team measured the entire film formation process via grazing incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and found that b-pV2F controls the perovskite crystallization by reducing perovskite formation energy, which results in a more ordered crystal structure. The cell configuration features a glass/indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, an electron acceptor made of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a perovskite layer, a phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
The device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.2% under standard illumination conditions, an open-circuit voltage of 1.18 V, a short-circuit current of 24.8 mA/cm2 , and a fill factor of 84.3%. The Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology (SIMIT) confirmed the results.
“The stability of unencapsulated devices under working conditions shows that target perovskite solar cells retain 96% of the initial power conversion efficiency after continuous maximum power point tracking for 1,000 hours,” the scientists said.
They described the cell technology in “Highly efficient p-i-n perovskite solar cells that endure temperature variations,” which was recently published in Science. The research group includes academics from Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) and the University of Stuttgart in Germany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Swansea University in the United Kingdom.

The figure falls far short of the 1,140 MW predicted by the DGEG, and as well as the 2.5 GW prediction in SolarPower Europe’s latest “EU Market Outlook” report.
The mismatch is likely because 2019 and 2020 auction projects missed their installation deadline at the end of last year, as discussed by SolarPower Europe’s head of market intelligence, Raffaele Rossi, in a recent interview with pv magazine. In October, the Portuguese government offered a remuneration boost to winners of these auctions, which had proved non-bankable amid rising inflation and equipment prices.
Nevertheless, growth has mainly been driven by large-scale projects going online, with the country adding 784 MW of new capacity by the end of November, a spokesperson for the Portuguese Association of Renewable Energy (APREN) told pv magazine. Portugal added around 546 MW of new PV systems in the first half of 2022, meaning it installed just 344 MW in the second half of the year.
The region that added the most solar was Alentejo, accounting for 177 MW of new installations. The region was responsible for 48% of national solar generation in 2022, according to the DGEG.
Spain-based Iberdrola and Prosolia secured approval this week for the construction of a 1.2 GW solar plant in the Alentejo region, which is set to become the largest such project in Europe upon construction.
Portugal’s cumulative solar capacity hit 2.59 GW at the end of 2022, outpacing the growth of all other renewable energy sources in the country since 2013.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/02/battery-supply-chain-state-of-health/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,LEGAL,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",,"FEBRUARY 2, 2023",Battery supply chain state of health,"Lithium-ion batteries can store energy from intermittent sources such as solar and wind generation, adding critical flexibility to the increasingly dynamic electric grid. But as the storage industry’s future brightens with new freestanding tax credits brought in by the Inflation Reduction Act, so does the spotlight on global battery supply chains.
The PV industry’s experience presents a cautionary tale: A recent report from US trade body the Solar Energy Industries Association found tightening trade regulations, designed to address labor concerns in the PV supply chain, contributed to a 23% decline in US solar installations last year compared with 2021.
An industry can adapt to such shifting policies, but this takes time, especially with so many moving parts. Anticipating and preparing for the future policy landscape, in tandem with the environmental, social, and corporate governance requirements of end customers, will be critical in realizing the storage industry’s full potential.
While trade policies in the solar supply chain center around a single element – silicon – navigating the upstream lithium-ion battery supply chain is an order of magnitude more complicated. In North America, electric vehicle batteries typically use nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistry, whereas stationary storage applications commonly use the less energy-dense lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry.
Both NMC and LFP cells consist of many sub-components, such as the cathode, anode, and electrolyte, each of which have their own extensive material supply chains. Critical materials such as graphite, lithium carbonate, copper, and aluminum all require various levels of mining and processing and may pass through multiple countries before winding up in a utility scale storage facility or electric vehicle. Given that complexity, what can buyers do to prepare for greater scrutiny of their supply chain and to pre-emptively improve accountability?
Potential regulation and growing consumer consciousness are putting increasing responsibility on battery sellers and buyers to build transparency into how, and with whom, they do business. The first step as a buyer is to clearly define corporate social responsibility policies by developing a code of conduct. This should set clear standards for topics such as labor practices, stakeholder engagement, and environmental impact mitigation. An equivalent code of conduct should also be developed for suppliers. By codifying values and company mission upfront, the appropriate tone for conversations with suppliers can be set.
Businesses without a corporate responsibility program to inform the drafting of codes of conduct should create one. This ensures their approved vendor list is limited to suppliers who align with their organization’s values. Two good resources for this are the ISO 26000 guidance on social responsibility, and the guidebook on responsible sourcing drawn up in 2021 by trade body the US Energy Storage Association.
Once a code of conduct is developed, appropriate language should be incorporated into supply agreements. The terms of supply deals should ensure that the code of conduct is applied to the supplier as well as to its entire supply chain, for all components. The language used must be binding and provide clear remedies if sub-suppliers are not compliant. Additional language, ensuring cooperation on other supply-chain related requests – such as facilities access and supply chain mapping – should also be included.
The mapping of a battery supply chain is critical to identify potential risks, as tracing materials to the mine level clearly identifies all participating suppliers. This level of visibility enables buyers to determine which sub-suppliers may bear greater risk of non-compliance with their code of conduct.
The complexity of the battery supply chain and potential resistance of sub-suppliers to sharing this information makes mapping challenging. To ease identification, it will be helpful to initially focus on sub-components which bear more risk or have limited areas of production, and to pay less attention to those materials that are manufactured globally in great quantities, for example copper and aluminum.
After negotiating for more transparency and access, and mapping the supply chain, it is important to verify that suppliers are indeed compliant with their contractual obligations. On-site processes and supplier qualification procedures should be reviewed and validated to ensure that the buyer’s code of conduct is being implemented in practice, rather than only on paper.
Before sourcing becomes even more complicated, there is a golden opportunity right now to incorporate more accountability into battery supply chains. Taking proactive measures to align purchasing with company values will pay dividends when new policies inevitably take shape.
This may present unique challenges depending on the size of businesses. A smaller company may have a harder time shifting its suppliers’ practices than a larger one. Ideally, coordination on uniform practices will ultimately utilize the industry’s collective bargaining power to push suppliers towards more transparency. The straightforward steps outlined above, meanwhile, can build resiliency to potential policy changes and meet consumer demand for responsible products.

Brazil has surpassed 17 GW of installed solar capacity in the distributed-generation sector, which includes PV projects below 5 MW in size. The new milestone corresponds to 98.6% of distributed-generation projects in Brazil, with more than 2 million PV systems installed across the country, according to ABSolar.
In 2023, 21,606 new PV projects below 5 MW in size have already been grid-connected in the country, with a total capacity of 192.36 MW, according to data from the National Agency of Electric Energy (Aneel). In 2022, the solar distributed generation sector accounted for 7.27 GW, corresponding to 749,462 connected PV systems.
Requests for connection to the electric distribution network from distributed-generation PV projects reached 32 GW over the past three months. In October 2022, there were just 5 GW in the pipeline. According to data from the Brazilian association of electric distributors (Abradee), distributors received a total of 460 thousand connection requests from projects below 75 kW and 26.5 thousand requests from projects between 75 kW and 5 MW.
The Energy Research Company – an R&D entity linked to the Ministry of Mines and Energy – only expected this volume to be reached in 10 years, the association’s director of regulatory affairs, Ricardo Brandão, said in a recent meeting at Aneel’s headquarters.

The European Commission has published a new document on the Green Deal Industrial Plan that EC President Ursula von der Leyen announced at Davos in mid-January.
The European counterpart to the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) aims to create an environment that is conducive to increasing the European Union's manufacturing capacity of “net-zero” technologies, to improve the competitiveness of European industry.
The plan proposed this week has yet to be discussed among member states and will be presented at the European summit in March. It includes proposals to make state aid more flexible, mobilize European funds, create a sovereign wealth fund, and improve European supply chains. The state aid revisions would apply until 2025, in comparison with the IRA’s 10-year time frame.
The industrial plan will be based on four pillars: a predictable and simplified regulatory environment, better access to finance, upskilling, and open trade for resilient supply chains.
As part of the first pillar, the European Commission will propose an industry law to set targets for industrial capacity and provide an adequate regulatory framework for rapid deployment. It will guarantee faster, simplified permits, while also promoting strategic European projects. The framework will be complemented by the Critical Raw Materials Act and electricity market reforms.
The second pillar of the plan will accelerate investment and financing to produce clean technologies in Europe. The European Commission said public funding could unlock huge amounts of private funding. It wants to relax the rules on state aid that will be applied through the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF) for state aid. This will involve the expansion of provisions for net-zero technologies and storage, while eliminating the need for open tenders for less mature technologies and extending deadlines to complete projects.
The fourth pillar of the plan will focus on ” putting trade at the service of the ecological transition,” under the principles of fair competition and open trade, based on commitments with European Union partners and the work of the World Trade Organization. To this end, the European Commission will further develop the European Union's network of free trade agreements and other forms of cooperation with partners to support the green transition. It will also explore the creation of a “critical raw materials club” to bring raw material consumers and resource-rich countries together, with the aim of ensuring global security of supply through a competitive, diversified industrial base.
The industrial plan is short on more details and does not discriminate between “net-zero” technologies in its policy proposals. This is something that SolarPower Europe has criticized.
“Industrial policy focus on critical renewable energy supply chains is a good thing. However, we’re worried by the lack of focus in today’s Communication,” said Dries Acke, policy director at SolarPower Europe. “Not all net-zero technologies are in the same boat – not in terms of strategic importance, or even the impact they’re feeling from the Inflation Reduction Act.”
Ursula von der Leyen said during the presentation of the plan that “Europe is determined to lead the clean technology revolution.” She added that better access to financing will allow key industries of clean technologies to “grow rapidly.”
Brussels has its sights set on the extraordinary Summit of EU Leaders on Feb. 9 and Feb. 10. The meeting is expected to address the community response to subsidies from the United States and from China, where announced investments in clean technologies will exceed $280 billion.

Australia-based Recharge Industries is considering making a play to buy failed battery startup Britishvolt from administrators in a move that could resuscitate plans to construct a GBP 3.8 billion ($4.71 billion) lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing plant in England’s Northumberland region.
Britishvolt had planned to build a lithium-ion battery cell gigafactory on a 93-hectare site at Blyth in Northumberland that at full capacity would have been able to manufacture enough cells for more than 300,000 lithium-ion batteries a year.Those plans are now in disarray, as Britishvolt appointed administrators in January, after running out of capital. The project had a promise of GBP 100 million in funding from the UK government, but that funding was only to be provided once the factory’s construction work hit a certain milestone that has not been reached.
It is understood that more than a dozen bidders have come forward following the appointment of administrators with potential buyers including Indian conglomerate Tata and Indonesia-linked fund Dea Lab. Britishvolt founder Orral Nadjari, who was removed as chief executive in 2022, is also said to be preparing a bid for the business.
Australia’s Recharge Industries has already submitted a preliminary bid for assets and is now looking to advance that process with administrators at EY reportedly pushing to close the deal by Feb. 3, 2023.
A successful offer would give Recharge Industries, owned by US-based investment firm Scale Facilitation, immediate scale in the booming battery energy storage industry.
Recharge Industries Chief Executive Officer Rob Fitzpatrick told The Guardian that should the offer proceed, the operation would provide the Australian company with greater access to Europe.
“Demand for lithium-ion battery storage is continuing to go through the roof,” he said.
Recharge Industries also plans to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles and stationary energy storage at a factory to be built in Geelong, southwest of Melbourne. The company’s stated goal is to start construction by the end of the year, targeting 2 GWh of production per year in 2024 and 6 GWh by 2026. At full capacity, the factory will manufacture up to 30 GWh of storage capacity per year.

While it has been around for over a decade, the sector has been struggling to identify a viable commercial model and make V2G attractive for EV owners reluctant to cede control of their vehicles.
However, numerous analyses and trials have shown that a two-way flow of electricity from EV batteries could deliver substantial opportunities for both soaking up excess renewables generation and releasing electricity back into the grid to manage issues in real time. And now a new research paper adds further evidence of the technology's potential.
According researchers from the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML), Leiden University, in the Netherlands, and the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), EV batteries alone could be used to satisfy short-term grid storage demand across most regions by as early as 2030.
In their assessment, the researchers considered both EV batteries in the vehicles that can be used via V2G and after the end of vehicle life, when they are removed and used in stationary storage. They estimated a total technical capacity of 32-62 TWh by 2050.
“This is significantly higher than the 3.4 TWh to 19.2 TWh required by 2050 in [International Renewable Energy Agency] and Storage lab scenarios,” said the paper.
In addition to quantifying the global EV battery capacity available for grid storage using an integrated model incorporating future EV battery deployment, the researchers also factored in battery degradation and market participation which for V2G may vary regionally depending on future market incentives and infrastructure, along with other factors.
Their focus was on the main EV battery markets of China, India, the European Union, and the United States, and what was called the “Rest of the World region.” In what they describe as conservative estimates, the researchers assess that low V2G participation rates of just 12% to 43% are needed to provide short-term grid storage demand globally without any second-use batteries in stationary storage.
If it is assumed that only half of second-use batteries are used on the grid, the required participation rate of V2G drops to below 10%, the researchers found. They discussed their findings in “Electric vehicle batteries alone could satisfy short-term grid storage demand by as early as 2030”, which was recently published in Nature Communications.

The government in the Australian state of Queensland has celebrated the opening of the Bulwer Island green hydrogen demonstration plant, a project handled by Japan’s biggest oil refiner, Eneos.
“The Bulwer Island facility will have capacity to produce up to 20 kilograms of green hydrogen a day, creating 30 new specialist jobs in the process,” the Queensland government said. It noted that the company is “investigating other sites in Queensland for future stages of its development.”
Eneos will produce the green hydrogen at the facility using its patented electrolysis technology, Direct MCH, powered by an onsite 250 kW solar system. The hydrogen will be produced in the form of methylcyclohexane, which fixes hydrogen with toluene and remains in a liquid form at normal temperature and pressure for storage and transportation. The grand plan is for the methylcyclohexane to be converted back to hydrogen in Japan.
The demonstration plant is the first project supported by the Japanese government’s $24 billion (USD 17 billion) Green Innovation Fund, dedicated to helping the nation reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
Eneos Senior Vice President Yuichiro Fujiyama described the demonstration of its technology in Queensland as a “great step,” noting the project will expand its scale “in near future.”
The demonstration plant appears to build on a feasibility study Eneos began with Origin Energy in 2021. The company is also moving forward with plans to develop a 204 MW solar farm in Edenvale, Queensland.
