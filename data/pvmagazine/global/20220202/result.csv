Next-generation photovoltaic inverters not only have to enable electricity to be fed into the grid but also act to support network operations.
With this in mind, a consortium of German research institutions and companies is now developing and testing new hardware and software for string inverters with high performance. The project is coordinated by German research Fraunhofer-Institut für Energiewirtschaft und Energiesystemtechnik IEE and supported by the Federal Ministry of Economics with around €4 million.
“In this project, the use of the latest technologies for photovoltaic inverters will be investigated and tested in order to enable cost and weight reduction while maintaining very high efficiency,” explained Klaus Rigbers, responsible for power electronics in the Innovation Center at German inverter manufacturer SMA Solar Technology.
The researchers are focusing on applying semiconductors based on gallium nitride (GaN) to string inverters. “So far, the use of GaN technology has been limited to significantly smaller power ranges,” explained Peter Friedrichs, vice president of semiconductor supplier Infineon Technologies' Industrial Power Control division. “It has already been shown  that GaN semiconductors enable even faster switching processes compared to silicon carbide (SiC) technologies and even more compared to classic silicon (Si) components.” The project is now intended to research the extent to which the GaN technology can be further developed.
German company Vacuumschmelze (VAC) will supply its semiconductors with optimized magnetic components and current sensors, which should make a significant contribution to reducing weight and volume. This is to be ensured by innovative, coupled inductances made from low-permeability, nanocrystalline toroidal cores, which, according to VAC, are significantly more compact and have lower losses than conventional solutions. “Another aspect is the development of broadband closed-loop current sensors that can also measure the current in the high-frequency range of the GaN semiconductors,” explained Simon Sawatzki, responsible for Development Inductive Components at VAC.
The Technical University of Cologne (TH Köln) is providing the theoretical basis for the new magnetic components. A benchmark with existing technologies should validate the expected benefits. “Advanced soft magnetic tape materials in new inductively coupled arrangements are a key to weight reduction in the targeted frequency-power range,” said Christian Dick, head of the Laboratory for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives at TH Köln.
The Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences is preparing, among other things, the integration of the new components into a technology demonstrator. “Developing functioning control electronics for the fast-switching GaN semiconductors is a major challenge,” said Marco Jung, who holds the professorship for electromobility and electrical infrastructure with a focus on power electronics at the university.
In addition to coordinating the project, Fraunhofer IEE is responsible for examining the newly developed components and making their operation as efficient as possible. “Using these new components, a technology demonstrator will then be set up in our laboratories, on which the function of the new technologies and the desired weight reduction will be validated in practical use and further steps for optimizing the system will be further considered,” explained Sebastian Sprunck, group leader for components and measuring systems at Fraunhofer IEE .

The most recent International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics (ITRPV) report from German engineering association Verbandes Deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbau (VDMA) predicts the disappearance of modules based on 156.75 mm and 158.75 mm cells in the next six years, and a drastic drop in the global market share for products relying on 166 mm cells. According to VDMA, these products will be replaced by panels with cells measuring 182 mm and 210 mm, which will represent, from 2023, a market share close to 50%.
The sudden success of these larger panels in the large-scale solar business has created a series of challenges for which most developers were not prepared. Currently, a high percentage of solar simulators are small in size and are not capable of measuring the maximum power of larger high-power modules over the entire surface with the required quality and stability. However, the accuracy of the measurements is extremely important to ensure that the end-user receives modules with the contracted power.
With this in mind, Spire Solar Iberia, a unit of Dutch PV module testing company EternalSun, has launched a state-of-the-art XL A+A+A+ solar simulator, which the company says can measure the maximum power of photovoltaic modules of any size with high precision and identify those with low performance.
EternalSun has a global customer base that includes Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE and the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). It launched in early 2020 the first XL solar simulator capable of measuring modules with dimensions up to 2.60 m x 1.40 m.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/02/titanium-wires-based-anti-soiling-coating-to-improve-solar-module-yield/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,THAILAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 2, 2022",Titanium wires-based anti-soiling coating to improve solar module yield,"A group of scientists from the Chiang Mai University in Thailand has used sparked titanium films to develop an anti-reflective, super hydrophilic, and photocatalytic coating for commercial solar modules.
The coating has photocatalytic properties that make the organic compounds adsorbed on the solar module surface decompose, thus preparing them to be easily washed off by rainwater. The films were prepared by the sparking process and resulted in fluffy morphology due to the irregular stacking of primary nanoparticles, which is the key factor ensuring the coating's superhydrophilic properties
The researchers used titanium wires with a size of 0.25 mm and purity of 99.5% supplied by UK-based high purity metals provider Advent Research Materials Ltd. “To form sparking tips, the wires were cut and aligned with a gap of 1 mm between the anode and cathode,” they explained. “The titanium wires were sparked off with a high DC voltage of around 3 kV discharged from a 24-nF capacitor.”
The design of the sparking system, according to them, enables the rapid deposition of nanoparticle films over large-area stationary substrates such as those of photovoltaic modules. “During sparking, electrons and ions produced from the neutral air molecules migrate toward the anode and cathode, respectively,” they further explained. “The bombardment of high-energy electrons and ions melt the metal tips. Hence, the nanodroplets are nucleated, which move toward the substrate and oxidized in atmospheric air.”

The scientists measured the surface morphology and film thickness through scanning electron microscopy, the water contact angles (WCA) through a custom-made tensiometer, and its optical transmittance via a UV–Vis spectrophotometer. “Due to the limitation of PV cover glass thickness and transparency, the experiments were performed on both the cover and slide glass substrates,” they specified.
The coating was tested on four south-oriented solar panels with a tilt angle of 19°. The panels have a power output of 5 W and were provided by Sun Solar Ecotech. Their performance was compared to that of another four panels of the same type provided by the same manufacturer. The surface topography of the uncoated and coated glasses was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The static contact angles of a water droplet on the uncoated and coated PV cover glass were evaluated to determine their hydrophilicity
The data collected during the outdoor experiment showed that the coated solar modules achieved a higher power yield of 6.62% during the entire study period, which spans from December 2018 to March 2019. “The long-term outdoor experiment demonstrated that the power difference per day (ΔP) increased significantly owing to the reduction of dust accumulation on the panel surface,” the scientist concluded. “ΔP reached the highest value of 14.22% in scattered light (cloudy day), which may be attributed to the antireflective properties of the coating.”
All the details on the coating technology can be found in the study “Antireflective, photocatalytic, and superhydrophilic coating prepared by facile sparking process for photovoltaic panels,” published in scientific reports.

Indian energy company Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has launched a tender for the deployment of 865 MW (AC) of distributed solar power.
The tendered capacity is expected to provide day-time power to agricultural consumers under the ‘Mukhyamantri Saur Krishi Vahini Yojna’ (MSKVY) scheme. The selected projects will range in size from 2 to 10 MW and will be awarded a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the selected developers.
The ceiling price has been set at INR 3.10 ($0.041)/kWh. Project developers will be responsible for the design, finance, procurement of land, engineering, procurement, construction, operation and maintenance of the projects. 
“Projects under construction, projects which are not yet commissioned and projects already commissioned but do not have any long-term PPA with any agency, and selling power on short-term or merchant plant basis shall be eligible,” the tender document reads.
MSEDCL has created a land portal where farmers have applied to rent out their lands for solar projects under the MSKVY scheme. The bidders can identify there the land required for the project.

Despite their numerous potential applications, the commercialization of SWBs has been hampered by the lack of low-cost, high-performance and environmentally friendly anode materials.
Whereas traditional carbon-based materials are a cost-efficient option, their electrochemical performance is below par so they have to be co-doped with multiple elements, such as nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S). Another issue is that currently known synthesis routes for co-doping are complex, potentially dangerous, and even unable to yield acceptable doping levels.
Now, a team of scientists from Korea Maritime and Ocean University has managed to overcome the complexity of synthesis and safety issues caused by harmful dopant precursor via a new synthesis route. They developed a one-step plasma-in-liquid process to synthesize N and S co-doped carbon-based anode material, which displayed great potential for seawater batteries.
Their process involved preparing a mixture of precursors containing carbon, N, and S and discharging plasma into the solution, resulting in a material with high doping levels of N and S with a structural backbone of carbon black. “The co-doped anode material we prepared exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance in SWBs, with a cycling life of more than 1500 cycles at a current density of 10 A/g,” Associate Professor Jun Kang said.
Namely, the NS/C anode created in this way even allowed seawater batteries to outperform lithium-ion batteries, making them a sustainable alternative to the ubiquitous battery technology. The material exhibits a large specific surface area (476.8 m2 g−1) and abundant active sites on its surface owing to its void structure. It has high initial coulombic efficiency of 84%. When the anode is applied to a sodium-ion half-cell, NS/C showed a remarkable cycling life of 35,000 cycles at an ultrahigh current density of 100 A g−1 with high reversible capacity of >72 mAh g−1.
“Owing to the advantages of this structure, NS/C evidently caused a co-intercalation reaction in an ether-based electrolyte while avoiding solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer formation on the anode surface,” the researchers wrote in their paper Facile in situ synthesis of dual-heteroatom-doped high-rate capability carbon anode for rechargeable seawater batteries, recently published in Carbon.
The potential maritime applications of SWBs are versatile, since they can be safely operated while completely submerged in seawater. They can be used to supply emergency power in coastal nuclear power plants or be installed on buoys to aid in navigation and fishing. But as Kang explains, seawater batteries can be most powerful when used in conjunction with renewable energy such as solar power.
“In other words, if renewable energy is used to charge the seawater battery, it can be the cleanest energy storage device,” Kang tells pv magazine. “Specifically, in the case of buoys for navigation signs, power is supplied using lead-acid batteries. However, lead-acid batteries are weak against corrosion, so their durability is very poor. In Korea, products that replace these lead-acid batteries with seawater batteries are being developed, and solar power is being used as an energy source to charge seawater batteries.”
Finally, seawater batteries can be installed as a power source for salvage equipment on passenger ships. “They would not only supply a higher energy density than conventional primary batteries, but also enable stable operation in water, thereby increasing survival probabilities,” Kang says.

This is the sixth deal announced by 1Komma5° since December, with five similar investments having been made in the German solar market.
1Komma5° was founded last summer by former Tesla and Sonnen Executive Philipp Schröder with the goal to initially raise up to €100 million to fund acquisitions of new PV installations and to create a “streamlined European platform player in order to decarbonize 500,000 buildings per year by 2030”. To this end, the company plans to expand its own financing options in order to increase the scope of the total investment to over €500 million. In December, 1Komma5° announced that Porsche Ventures also became a shareholder of the company.
Through the new transaction in Sweden, Schröder hopes to raise the company's annual revenue to between €80 million and €100 million and to reach an annual solar deployment of up to 6,000 rooftop systems, heat pumps and other types of home energy systems.
Referring to the climate goal of keeping global warming below 1.5°, Schröder emphasizes the need for mass decarbonization within the building sector on a never-before-seen scale and magnitude. “The technology and the capital are available, but the market simply lacks execution capacity when it comes to the installation of climate protection technology,” he further explained. “Instead, the execution is left to a fragmented market of thousands of small companies, which not only lack resources and skilled labor but most importantly a holistic strategy to connect all decentral assets into an Internat-of-Thing set-up.”
1Komma5° is not the only European player trying to build or secure installation capacity on a bigger scale. In Germany, with a particularly fragmented market so far, it is obvious that investment money is flowing now into the sector. For example, some manufacturers and utilities are investing in regional operations to have better control of the markets for their components. Others, like Berlin-based Enpal, are building up installation capacities themselves.
The new units of 1Komma5° all report strong growth targets, which are made possible by the new parent company's growth capital. “What convinced us, next to its unique strategy and ambition, is that we as founders and shareholders received a re-participation in 1Komma5°, thus remaining part of the story,” explained Gunnar Jönsson, CEO and co-founder of Cellsolar. “Also Cellsolar is now financed to not only achieve its growth targets but to simultaneously acquire specialized electrician and installation companies in Sweden, Denmark and Finland to increase our capacity, improve cost for our customers and gain control of the relevant aspects of our value chain.”

“I am glad that we can now increase the support for the installation of residential PV systems,” said Norwegian Minister of Climate and Environment, Espen Barth Eide, referring to the government's recent decision to grant Enova an additional grant of NOK 750 million (84.8 million), on top of the yearly NOK 3 billion that is usually awarded to the agency. “For the individual consumers, this means lower electricity bills and a greater overview of costs.”
Under the new provisions, Enova will increase the maximum system size eligible for the rebates from 15 to 20 kW and the maximum subsidy amount from 1,250 to 2,000 NOK ($226.7) per kW installed. The maximum subsidy amount will increase from 26,250 to 47,500 NOK ($5,386.0). In addition, new subsidies of up to 10,000 NOK will be introduced for energy management systems that are often installed alongside solar arrays.
“This is great news for homeowners thinking about going solar in Norway. Many are waiting to make a decision, and this will get them going,” Andreas E Thorsheim, the CEO of Norwegian tech company Otovo, told pv magazine. “We expect a rush of demand and a step up to larger systems.”
Thorsheim expects the new measures will take effect on sales immediately and on installations gradually during the second quarter. “The average size of an Otovo system sold in Norway was approximately 10kW in the fourth quarter,” he added.  “The news represents a complete reversal for the Norwegian market, which could grow to five-digit installation numbers.” Otovo has currently a market share of approximately 50% in Norway.
According to recent figures released by Norwegian solar industry body the Solenergiklyngen, the Scandinavian country may have installed around 65MW of new PV capacity in 2021.
If that result is confirmed by official numbers which will be published by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE), in February or March, last year may prove to have been the best year ever recorded for the Scandinavian country, in terms of new solar installations.
In 2020, the newly installed PV capacity was around 31.7MW and, in the previous year, new solar arrays totaled 51MW. Norway had added 23.5MW of solar in 2018; 18MW a year earlier, and 11MW in 2016.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/02/sun-tracking-tessellated-photovoltaic-array-for-use-in-space-restricted-areas/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 2, 2022",Sun-tracking tessellated photovoltaic array for use in space-restricted areas,"Scientists in South Korea have fabricated a shape-transformable 3D PV system based on tessellated solar-cell units that is claimed to be an ideal solution for both urban and rural environments with limited areas for the deployment of photovoltaics.
The proposed system is based on shape-memory-alloy components that act as actuators, based on the solar cell temperature, to automatically adjust the shape of the array in response to the sun’s position, with no need for machinery. “The cross-sectional area perpendicular to the incident light increases as the actuator flattens the panels, facilitating an automated solar-tracking effect,” the researchers explained. “In addition, this solar-tracking concept can be applied to tessellated modules, which have the advantage that they use widely available commercial crystalline silicon (Si) solar cells.”
According to the research team, the PV system is able to increase electricity yield by 60% over a day compared to a fixed flat panel due to the shorter shadow length and the bifacial effect obtained during shape transformation. “Direct light is gathered effectively on some surfaces and scattered and reflected light is gathered on other surfaces, an effect that cannot be obtained in solar modules that use conventional tracking systems,” they emphasized.
The solar cells were cut in a range of shapes such as rectangles, equilateral triangles and right-angled triangles, with silicone rubber or a metal mesh being used as the backbone to create the 2D arch shape. The cells were placed on the backbone strip at regular intervals and were connected using metal wire or textile electrodes and soldering. The shape-memory-alloy strips were made with nickel-titanium shape-memory alloy and applied to the surface of each solar cell panel. The tessellated solar cells were then encapsulated in a silicone material using a casing method.

The researchers pointed out that, in the tessellated modules, the transformation of the solar-cell array is triggered by the shape-memory-alloy components between the tessellation units and in the linkage spaces. “Therefore, the temperature of the shape-memory-alloy components between the solar-cell surfaces is more important than the temperature of the surfaces themselves,” they also said. “The temperatures of the shape-memory-alloy components located between the solar-cell units at a distance of 3 mm from the cell surface and that of the linkage backbone follow a similar trend to the temperature of the solar cell surface, but with values that are 2–6 °C lower.”
The device was tested under standard illumination conditions and its performance was compared to that of conventional fixed flat panels. The system efficiency was evaluated based on the maximum power output from the array per unit installed area.
The output power of the tessellated solar-cell arrays was found to drop with increasing angle of incidence (AOI) or decrease when following the cosine of the AOI. “However, the superior solar-tracking performance of the shape-transformable 3D tessellated solar-cell arrays was little affected by the AOI,” the Korean group specified, noting that the installed-area-based efficiency was raised by the shape-transformable solar tracking in all cases. “The efficiency of shape-transformable tessellated solar-cell arrays with respect to the installation area can provide superior omnidirectional performance compared to flat fixed solar panels.”
Tight-angled triangle-shaped solar cells showed the best performance in the short arch and offered superior performance under omnidirectional incident light. “The part of the array that is self-shaded during shape transformation acts as the reverse side of a bifacial photovoltaic module, providing shape-transformable tessellated solar-cell arrays with the advantages of both a solar-tracking system and a bifacial PV module,” the scientists concluded. “This study introduces the shape-transformable photovoltaic module concept; many more areas of research remain, including efficient power management of each cell and 3D designs suitable for specific applications.”
The cell technology was introduced in the paper “Automated shape-transformable self-solar-tracking tessellated crystalline Si solar cells using in-situ shape-memory-alloy actuation,” published in scientific reports. The research group is formed by scientists from the Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute and the University of Science and Technology.

In a rapid escalation from zero activity in February last year, exploration companies are now scrambling to look for what they believe could be the cheapest, easiest way to get their hands on the much hyped “future fuel”: hydrogen.
In the last 12 months, six different companies have either been granted or applied for 18 Petroleum Exploration Licences across the state of South Australia, according to Australian energy consultancy EnergyQuest. Combined, the area under permit equates to around 570,000 square kilometres (km2) or 32% of the entire state, the consultancy has found, referring to the sudden influx as a “boom”.
Until now, natural or native hydrogen has been largely overlooked – despite it being described as “widespread in nature” by natural hydrogen researcher Viacheslav Zgonnik in a 2020 paper. Natural hydrogen deposits form through chemical reactions underground, with Zgonnik saying the molecule has been detected at high concentrations, often as the major gas, in all types of geologic environments.
Nonetheless, natural hydrogen has garnered relatively little interest – even as recent years have seen enthusiasm for the molecule skyrocket with thousands of companies announcing a plethora of means to produce it.

The renewed interest in these underground cavities filled with hydrogen came, according to EnergyQuest, from the “chance rediscovery” of historical reports of two wells drilled in the 1930s where high purity hydrogen was detected.
The company which now owns the exploration rights to the area where this high-purity hydrogen was detected is Brisbane-based firm Gold Hydrogen. It has been granted the right to explore approximately 9,500km2 near Adelaide, specifically the southern part of the Yorke Peninsula through to Kangaroo Island.
According to Gold Hydrogen, its exploration licence 687, which was last year expanded by the state government to include hydrogen, was granted after director Luke Titus provided evidence of discoveries of flowing natural hydrogen with contents of up to 90% purity. Follow up testing near the discoveries have been independently verified and audited, the company says, adding that its rights permit it to begin undertaking further exploration testing from 2022.
Gold Hydrogen’s aim is to be the first in Australia to produce, use and sell natural hydrogen which it described as an “inexhaustible source of green energy.”
Why it is calling the source, which would essentially be mined, “inexhaustible” is because it is believed the chemical reaction that leads to underground hydrogen deposits continually regenerates, though it is also critical to note that technical and scientific knowledge of natural hydrogen reservoirs is limited.

That said, in March last year the CSIRO published a paper entitled ‘Hydrogen in Australian natural gas: occurrences, sources and resources’ in which the Commonwealth scientific research agency considered natural hydrogen, updating the “scarce reporting of hydrogen in Australian natural gas”.
There has also been considerable interest in storing hydrogen in salt caverns and other underground formations. It appears natural hydrogen uses these principles without human intervention.
Despite the lack of research, Australians – and indeed a number of companies internationally – remain undeterred, likely because of the potential for natural hydrogen to be three to four times cheaper than that produced via electrolysis or gas reforming with carbon capture. Gold Hydrogen estimates it should be able to produce natural hydrogen for less than $2.30 per kg, compared to manufactured hydrogen projects being produced at greater than $6 per kg.
Importantly, it seems natural hydrogen would still carry the label “green”, though again it may be too early to say.
To date, the only major discovery and implementation of natural hydrogen reservoirs have been in Mali in west Africa. In 2012, natural hydrogen was discovered and eventually connected to a fuel cell to supply electricity to the town of Bourabougu. 
Canadian company Hydroma, behind the project, is now preparing to produce and export its natural hydrogen.

Vistra is planning a third expansion for its Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility in Moss Landing, Monterey County, California.
When Vistra’s first expansion was announced in 2020, it quadrupled the battery system’s size, making it the largest battery storage installation in the world, a couple of times over. At the time, the world’s largest operating battery storage system was the Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, which used Tesla batteries and was colloquially known as the Tesla Big Battery. Moss Landing uses Tesla batteries.
The Moss Landing site was in the news less than a year after it was completed, as it was knocked offline when an unspecified number of batteries overheated. At the time the 100MW/400MWh Phase II facility at the Moss Landing site was already up and running and remained operational.
For this third expansion, the company has entered into a 15-year resource adequacy agreement with Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) for a new 350MW/1,400MWh battery system. This would complement the existing 400MW/1,600MWh of energy storage capacity already at the site.
On Jan. 21, 2022, PG&E filed its application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to approve the contract, with a decision expected within 180 days. Pending the receipt of CPUC approval, Vistra anticipates construction on the third phase to commence in May 2022 and begin commercial operations prior to June 2023.
“These innovative battery energy storage systems are necessary to maintain electric grid reliability as increasing levels of intermittent renewable power are integrated into the electric grid,” said Curt Morgan, Vistra CEO.
Like previous phases, Moss Landing Phase III will be able to move quickly due to the already-approved development permit and its location on a Vistra-owned power plant site with existing interconnection and infrastructure.
Today’s announcement brings the Moss Landing site’s total energy storage capacity to 750MW/3,000 MWh.
Morgan continued, “With this planned expansion, we are moving the Moss Landing site closer to its full potential. With additional phases, this project could eventually reach 1,500MW.”
