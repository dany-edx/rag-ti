The company has acquired U.S. lithium-metal battery start-up Cuberg and plans to open an R&D center in Silicon Valley. With the acquisition, Northvolt can integrate the start-up's electrolyte technology into its battery systems for considerably improved energy density. Until now, Northvolt has operated in Sweden, Germany, and Poland.
Cuberg – which currently looks to supply the electric aviation sector – claims its batteries deliver 70% more range and capacity than other lithium-ion devices developed for electric aviation. The startup aims to work with Northvolt to mature its technology sufficiently to offer cells with an energy density exceeding 1 kWh/l by 2025. In June, the start-up had its technology tested by Idaho National Laboratory on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy. The laboratory tested the 5-ampere-hour cells of Cuberg and found they had specific energy of 369 Wh/kg and specific power of 2,000 W/kg.
Lithium-metal batteries substitute heavy graphite in the anode with a lighter metal to cut down on weight, and thus improve gravimetric energy density. Swapping graphite from the anode renders conventional electrolytes unusable, however. A problem that  Cuberg claims to have solved with its electrolyte technology that provides stability comparable to that offered by solid-state batteries in its devices.

The start-up was spun out of Stanford University in 2015 and has already attracted high-level customers and investors. The client list includes aviation companies Boeing, BETA Technologies, Ampaire, and VoltAero and Cuberg's backers include Boeing venture capital arm HorizonX Ventures, Activiate.org, the California Energy Commission, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy at Stanford.
“The Cuberg team has shown exceptional ability to develop world-class technology, proven results and an outstanding customer base in a lean and efficient organization,” said Northvolt CEO and co-founder Peter Carlsson. “Combining these strengths with the capabilities and technology of Northvolt allows us to make significant improvements in both performance and safety while driving down cost even further for next-generation battery cells. This is critical for accelerating the shift to fully electric vehicles and responding to the needs of the leading automotive companies within a relevant time frame.”
Northvolt says it can scale the Cuberg technology using its lithium-ion battery manufacturing lines and the partners plan to ship their first batteries to the electric aviation industry within three years. The Silicon Valley research center aims to develop lithium-metal cells further and bring together research from Europe and North America.
“We are very excited to join forces with Northvolt to build the future of clean energy together,” said Cuberg CEO and co-founder Richard Wang. “Northvolt brings incredible technology and manufacturing capabilities that will accelerate the commercialization and adoption of our lithium metal technology. Their deep engineering experience and bold spirit perfectly complement Cuberg's own culture of rapid innovation.”
Northvolt recently announced a $200 million expansion of its production site in Gdansk, Poland, to raise annual production capacity from 5 to 12 GWh. With that step, the factory is on track to become Europe's largest.

The system installed by Spanish business ZIV Automation–to free up enough grid capacity to connect a 30 MW solar plant–was developed, tested and commissioned by the U.K. unit of the company. The solar generation capacity added as a result, accounts for a third of the 90 MW of connected photovoltaic capacity hosted by the Central Energy System, the most expansive of Mongolia's five electricity network sections.
ZIV–which is owned by Saudi electricals parent Alfanar–was commissioned to enable connection of the Desert Solar Power One solar farm. The network management system has now been handed over to state authorities the National Power Transmission Grid and National Dispatching Centre.
The solar project–built by engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services business Monhorus LLC in Sainshand, Dornogobi province–was enabled to connect to the network ahead of a planned €65 million expansion of the Central Energy System grid with 220km of new transmission lines. The smart grid ANM system developed by ZIV Automation manages the network in such a way the 30 MW solar farm can generate at full output other than when the grid nears capacity during demand peaks, when solar production can be curtailed.
EPC company Monhorus is a joint venture established by local diesel-generator installer Monhorus International and Polish peer Horus Energia.
ZIV Automation says Mongolia's Central Energy System has peak demand of 1.2 GW and 155 MW of wind farm capacity in addition to its solar assets.
English company UB Grid Consultancy Ltd acted as consultant on the ZIV Automation project.
This copy was amended on 11/03/21 to add the facts the ANM system is now owned by state authorities, the planned transmission lines will cost an estimated €65 million, and the 30 MW capacity of the Desert Solar Power One project is among the 90 MW of solar capacity connected to the Central Energy System.

The new provisions come into force a year after a related law was signed and two years after Russia’s State Duma–the lower house of parliament–unanimously adopted a draft law developed by the Ministry of Energy.
Under the net metering regime, which is open to both private citizens and businesses, PV system owners will be allowed to sell surplus power to their respective power distributors at a price of between RUB1.7 and 2 per kilowatt-hour ($0.022-0.026).
“An immense demand may come from small enterprises working in regions with electricity prices at 6-10 rubles per kilowatt-hour and those regions, mostly in the south and far east, [which] claim to have high irradiation level that makes the solar power economically viable,” Anton Usachev, president of the Russian Solar Energy Association, told pv magazine.
According to him, Russia has, currently, an installed residential PV capacity of around 40 MW. “In 2020, around 13 MW of PV modules were bought by individuals,” he also revealed.
The plan to launch net metering in Russia dates back to early 2017.

Founded in 1996 and known worldwide, Solon AG can boast of being one of the first module manufacturers in Germany and the world. Two years later, the company was listed on the German stock market and acquired the Berlin-based manufacturer Solarwerk. The company's founder, Lars Podlowski, then took over the management of module production at Solon, a position he held until 2002, when Solarwerk merged with the distributor Energie Biss to form Solon Photovoltaik GmbH, the first subsidiary of Solon AG to focus on photovoltaics. Podlowski put his stamp on Solon for quality and innovation and went from head of research and development (2002-2005) to chief technology officer of Solon SE, which had some golden years.
At the end of 2011, Solon filed for bankruptcy in a horror year for the solar industry in which companies such as Solyndra and Q-Cells (founded by former Solon board members and taken over by the Korean conglomerate Hanwha in 2012) went bankrupt.
The Indian cell manufacturer Microsol International, based in the United Arab Emirates and at the time a supplier of Solon, took over the company and the subsidiaries in the USA and Italy in 2012, and the group was renamed Solon Energy GmbH. At the Intersolar 2012 trade fair in Munich, Solon Energy GmbH was “one of the first providers” to present an energy storage system for residential clients. Two years later, Solon Energy stopped production in Berlin and, in September 2014, the company's German subsidiaries again filed for bankruptcy.
From 2020, however, Solon was present in Europe again. pv magazine has asked the new company whether the “new” Solon is related to the former German group or whether the new owners have just revived the brand. “We believe that Solon's withdrawal from the European market in 2015 left a gap that we want to fill,” said Ramona Storck, a member of the management team of the new photovoltaic company, alongside Podlowski. “Over the years, Solon has developed numerous innovations that made the company unique. Since 2018, a team of former Solon R&D staff has been developing new products that we are now bringing to market, and we will continue to develop novel proposals that rely on the quality that made us famous,” she added.
In order to restart the company in Europe, former Solon employees including Podlowski and the then-sales manager for the DACH region (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) Storck, founded a new company, Solyco Solar AG, the parent company of the new Solon in Europe, whose name should avoid confusion with the still existing “Solon” companies in the USA and India. In the current corporate structure, Solyco Technologie GmbH is responsible for research and development and Solyco Solar AG for sales and marketing, as well as supply chain management.
“Solyco Technology GmbH has been around for a long time. It is a former Solon research and development company that was taken over by Lars Podlowski in 2012 and has been active as a sales company since last year,” explained Storck. “All the people who were involved in building up the company come from the former Solon environment, which was also an incentive to revive the old name,” she stated.
The new Solon is active in Europe and focuses primarily on the residential, commercial and industrial segments. “The brand stands for high-quality photovoltaic products, both modules and systems,” explained Storck, adding that the company has new products in the pipeline that she can't reveal yet.
Solon currently does not have its own production facilities but, rather, carefully selects the suppliers of all components–from the cell to the glass to the EVA–and prescribe what should be used. “The modules are manufactured in factories that we control,” Storck said.
Podlowski was most recently a member of the management of the engineering and consulting company Photovoltaik-Institut Berlin (PI Berlin), which specializes in production audits.

The simple answer is, the global solar fleet could generate an extra $14.48 billion in 2024 if asset management and operations and maintenance (O&M) were carried out to the highest standards.
That remarkable claim is the result of a study by digital asset management company Raycatch. The automated diagnostics provider fed the data of 75 solar plants into its proprietary DeepSolar artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analytics software and received what it described as the first quantification of technical issues in PV plants from real-data analysis.
In January, a Raycatch team collected data from sites in the United States, Japan, Germany, India, Italy, the United Kingdom, Australia, Denmark, Norway, Finland, France, Spain, Romania, Israel, Taiwan, and Thailand, representing a cumulative generation capacity of 1.2 GW.
Running the numbers through AI-driven software enabled Raycatch to eliminate data ‘noise' such as that generated by faulty sensors, shading, temperature changes, clouds, and electrical issues. Without the analytical properties of the AI-driven software, the researchers claimed, such noise would have obscured meaningful information which identified patterns and the root-causes of problems.
The arrays studied had an average generation capacity of 16.1 MW and featured 2,298 strings connected to 115 inverters.
The data analysis identified worn-out equipment as one of the most common causes of solar system under-performance. That might comprise degradation, back sheet, or soldering issues in modules, with panel problems making up a striking 80% of the performance issues analyzed. Inverter efficiency loss, which occurred in 55% of the plants analyzed; and string disconnection, which occurred in 65%, were also big culprits. Solar tracker malfunctions and faulty cables, connectors, and sensors were another problem, with faulty sensors occurring at a quarter of the sites. A lack of cleaning and grass cutting was among the other issues observed, as well as inefficient and lengthy manual repairs, according to the Raycatch analysis.
Having filtered out the irrelevant noise in the data, the Raycatch team ran the figures to estimate the volume of “recoverable energy” based on generation levels in the previous 12 months. The team estimated the plants had an average 5.27% recoverable energy. Translated into an annual figure, that added up to a $160,000 increase for the average, 16.1 MW plant.
The findings were married up with forecast assumptions made by industry body SolarPower Europe to calculate $6.3 billion worth of solar electricity will have been lost due to such failings in 2019, when the world had an estimated 630 GW of solar generation capacity. Based on the expectation that the global solar fleet could swell to 1,448 GW by 2024, the annual bill for such component failures could hit $14.48 billion.

The 250 kW demonstration project, which is supported by a £640,000 grant from U.K. government funder Innovate UK and is scheduled for completion by the end of April, is being built with a 15m high lattice tower, two 25-ton weights suspended by steel cables, and two grid-connected generator units.
“Our full scale projects will operate underground–but for this scale demonstrator, we’ve built an above-ground structure,” said the company's engineering project manager, Frances Tierney. “This two-month test program will confirm our modeling and give us valuable data for our first full scale, 4-8 MW project, which will commence later this year.”
The company said the lattice tower was built by English engineering firm ESL, based in Hull, and the base frame and weight baskets were made by AJS Fabrication, which is a steel fabrication company based in Fife, Scotland. The winches and control modules were provided by Huisman, a Dutch manufacturer of heavy lifting, drilling, pipe laying, and mooring systems. Glasgow-based Industrial Systems and Control (ISC) supported Gravitricity with controls and simulations.
A tower uses renewable energy to raise a mass in a 150-1,500m shaft and discharges the electricity thus ‘stored’ by releasing the mass to rotate the two power generators. According to the company, the mass in similar facilities can range from 500 to 5,000 tons.
The technology is claimed to have a faster response time than lithium-ion storage technology and to be able to help stabilize electricity networks at 50Hz by responding to full power demand in less than a second. The demonstrator will be linked to the port’s electricity grid.
The system is also said to have a 25-year life cycle without loss of performance or cyclical degradation. The company said it can be, potentially, located anywhere, although disused mine shafts were indicated as ideal locations.
Gravity storage has begun to raise interest in the renewable energy industry in recent years. U.S. company Energy Vault unveiled, in 2019, gravity-based storage technology relying on a crane and 35-ton concrete blocks. Austrian research organization the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) recently suggested gravitational energy storage for low-energy-demand locations.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/10/solar-arrays-on-canals/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 10, 2021",Solar arrays on canals,"India has been installing solar on canals as an innovative way to provide renewable energy for farming without using agricultural land. Such projects benefit from easy grid availability, as most of India’s large canal systems feature small, grid-connected hydroelectric plants.
The generating potential from canal-top solar plants is at least 10 GW, according to Premier Energies Executive Director Sudhir Moola.
“India has around 120 major canal systems covering a length of about 10,097 kilometers,” Moola told pv magazine. “Even if 50% of this canal length (about 5,000 km) is usable for canal-top solar installation, we can do 2 MW to 3 MW for every kilometer of the canal, assuming 15 to 20 meters of canal width. That gives us a potential 10 GW of canal-top solar power systems that can be installed saving more than 40,000 acres of land.”
PV panels on canals also lead provide a cooling effect by shading canals, which reduces water losses due to evaporation, he added. 
Canal capacity
The state government of Gujarat started looking at canal-top solar in India in 2011, as it looked for ways to increase renewable energy production while avoiding land conflicts. This led to the commissioning of India’s first canal-top solar project at Chandrasan village, about 45 km from Ahmedabad.
Gujarat State Electricity developed the 1 MW PV plant on a 750-meter stretch of a canal with the support of  Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd.. It has since commissioned 35 MW of such projects, with a tender in the works for 100 MW of additional canal-top solar capacity. 
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) then launched a pilot project scheme in 2014 to develop 100 MW of grid-connected solar PV capacity over canals and along their banks, via state-run agencies. The scheme provided viability gap funding (VGF) support for canal-top PV projects and canal-bank installations. As of March 31, 2019, 50 MW canal-bank solar PV projects and 44 MW canal-top solar PV projects had been commissioned.  The scheme has since been closed.
“Canal-top solar installation requires a shadow-free stretch of canal with an ideal width between 20 and 30 meters,” said Pulkit Dhingra, founder and director, AHA! Solar, a digital solutions provider for project management. “A motorable road along the canal allows for development and maintenance. North-south canal flow is ideal [to get maximum output from the panels], but east-west direction can also be used for panel installation.”
Canal-top projects cost more than normal ground-mounted arrays and floating solar plants, as they require  support structures to span the widths of the canals. Such structures could be installed end-to-end, or without touching the ends of the canals. In the latter approach, piers can be installed within the canals and panels can be mounted on them. For wider canals, such as those in Punjab, it’s important to install piers within the canals.
Another approach is to use high-tensile steel to mount the modules. Premier Energies is the only company in India to have used this approach, in a 1 MW canal-top system in Uttarakhand in 2017. The project is still the widest canal-top installation in India, with a width of 35 meters, without piles in the canal.
“I don’t think you will find this anywhere in the world. And the plant has been performing for last four years with no incidents, despite being subject to high winds being close to Yamuna River,” said Moola.
The innovative design could be used in canal-top solar projects throughout the world, according to Dhingra.
“Innovative designs like cantilever type [a beam anchored at only one end to a vertical support] can help to decrease the cost and still utilize the canals for generating solar power,” he added. “If the canal top is planned at the time of construction of canals, it can help reduce capital costs and solve both the purpose of generation of electricity and saving water.”
Canal-top installations in India typically use polysilicon module technology.
“The cost of structures for canal top in itself is high, so using a commercially viable technology makes better sense. Moreover, in conditions like India, polysilicon provides better performance,” Pulkit said. 
He said bifacial panels could be a better option, as they reduce overall weight in structures. However, the commercial viability of bifacial modules needs to be examined, he added.
“If the reduction in the structure’s weight is less and increase in the cost is high, then it doesn’t make sense,” Pulkit said. 
Key challenges
Excessively wide or narrow canals pose challenges for cost-effective system design. 
“In a normal land-based project, you can install columns at three to four meters length, which is the span of the structure,” said Moola. “Whereas in a canal, you can have one column post at the descent to support the structure, and on the other side, you can have one more. So when the span increases, the type of structure the column weighs go up quite high.”
The canal width should ideally be 20 to 22 meters to keep structural costs under control, said Dhingra. The support structure should also allow access to the canal. Module cleaning and operations and maintenance could be a challenge, given the limited access to panels.
Moola said that Premier Energies maintains a structure-to-structure gap of 4 meters to 5 meters. This leaves a gap for pipelines to extract water from canals. A floating pontoon also could be used for periodic desilting and cleaning of canals.

The agency is currently working with the municipalities of Wierden, Almelo, Borne, Hengelo, Enschede, the government of Overijssel province, and local grid operator Enexis to assess the feasibility of the project.
“The parties involved, in close collaboration with residents and businesses, will investigate how roadsides along the 35-kilometer along the A35 can be used for the generation of solar energy,” the Rijkswaterstaat said, adding that the plant should be deployed on property owned by the national government and the municipalities.
A spatial analysis project was launched in 2018 to determine which portions of land could be used for the solar facility, based on environmental and technical parameters. The project, which is part of a government program to build renewable energy pilot projects on state land, is the third project of its kind in the Netherlands. Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell plans to install 48 MW of solar generation capacity near Rijksweg 59, a Dutch highway that spans the provinces of Zeeland, South Holland and North Brabant.
Rijkswaterstaat also plans to build another solar park along the A37 in Drenthe province. The project will involve the installation of PV modules along either side of a 40-kilometer stretch of highway, in addition to solar panels on the median strip between the two lanes.
The potential for Dutch highways to host solar has been highlighted since October 2017, when Dutch construction firm Heijmans announced plans to install noise barrier-integrated bifacial solar modules along several major roads.
The Dutch authorities are struggling to identify new surfaces on which to deploy large-scale PV plants, due to the scarcity of usable land. In recent years, research institutes and private companies across the densely populated country have tried to prove the feasibility of solar projects on surfaces that do not damage agricultural land, including rooftops, road noise barriers, onshore and offshore water surfaces, as well as bike lanes.

The company has now launched the qualification stage of the procurement process, which will be followed by a request for proposals.
“The pilot project will generate up to 80 GWh of power per year, which will be allocated to a mix of large consumers and utilities in Zambia, and regional competitive markets,” the company said in a statement. “The pilot project is likely to be the first project in Zambia to take advantage of the new open-access regime introduced by the government of Zambia under the Electricity Act 2019 and the Energy Regulation Act 2019.”
These new rules made it easier for IPPs to operate in the Zambian energy market. Under the previous regulatory framework, only the country's state-owned utility, Zesco, was allowed to sell power to final consumers.
The solar plant will sell power to Greenco under a long-term power purchase agreement. Interested IPPs will have time until March 21 to submit their requests for qualification.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Zambia had 96 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2019 and around 95 MW were deployed in that year alone. The country is currently supporting solar through the Scaling Solar program and the Zambian REFiT Strategy, an initiative developed with the support of German development bank KFW.
The Zambian government is aiming to deploy 500 MW of solar PV by 2023, in order to further reduce the country’s chronic power shortages. The sub-Saharan country is currently relying on 2.8 GW of installed power, around 85% of which comes from hydropower. Its access to electricity is about 31%.

Infraco Africa, a unit of U.K.-based Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG), and Canadian private equity firm JCM Power, will begin construction on the 20 MW Golomoti solar plant in Malawi in the current quarter. 
Completion of the solar facility, which is planned to be located in Dedza, about 100km southeast of the capital, Lilongwe, is scheduled for early 2022. The plant will be coupled to a storage capacity of between 5 and 10 MWh.
The power plant will connect to the adjacent Golomoti substation, which will operate a 132 kV transmission line to supply the national grid.
The project is financially backed by the U.K. Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. It will be used to provide grid stability and reduce national dependence on diesel generators and hydroelectric generation.
The performance data of the storage system is expected to provide crucial information for the installation of other similar systems in the region. “We are delighted to work with our partners at JCM to enrich Malawi's national electricity grid with an additional 20 MWp of clean energy,” said Infraco Africa CEO, Gilles Vaes. “The achievement of this key milestone is due to strong support from the Malawi government, regulators and the national utility Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi Limited (ESCOM).”
“By strengthening the country’s energy capacity and launching innovative electricity storage systems, Golomoti Solar will provide Malawian households and businesses with the more reliable power supply needed for economic growth,” said Justin Woodward, JCP Power co-founder.
The two companies are already partnering on construction of Malawi’s largest PV plant–the 60 MW Salima project–for which JCM issued a similar EPC tender in February 2018. That project, which will also sell power to ESCOM under a 20-year PPA, was selected in a public tender held by Malawi’s government between December 2016 and May 2017.
In February 2017, the Malawian power provider announced a plan to add around 70 MW of solar generation capacity to the national grid by contracting independent power producers.
In September, South Africa’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research launched a tender to seek consultants for the development of a technology roadmap for solar development in Malawi.
Only 5% of Malawi’s rural population has access to power, a figure that rises to 46% in urban areas. That means only 12% of the nation’s population has access to electricity and the government wants to raise that figure to 30% by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/10/iii-v-multi-junction-solar-cell-with-39-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FINLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 10, 2021",III-V multi-junction solar cell with 39% efficiency,"A group of scientists from the Tampere University in Finland has developed a III-V multi-junction solar cell which is claimed to have the potential for reaching a power conversion efficiency of close to 50%.
Presented in the paper Wide spectral coverage (0.7–2.2 eV) lattice‐matched multijunction solar cells based on AlGaInP, AlGaAs and GaInNAsSb materials, published in Progress of Photovoltaics, the four-junction device was built with three different III-V materials: indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) for the first junction; gallium arsenide (GaAs) for the second element; and gallium-indium-nitride-arsenide-antimony (GaInNAsSb) for the other two junctions.
The four devices have bandgaps of 1.88, 1.42, 1.17, and 0.93 electronvolts (eV), respectively, and their combination, according to the researchers, achieves a wide spectral coverage. “This structure covers, efficiently, the spectral range of 350-1,310nm, in which intra‐band efficiency can theoretically reach over 52% efficiency under 1,000‐sun illumination,” the scientists explained. “Assuming the use of materials with optimal bandgaps of 2, 1.51, 1.16, and 0.79 eV, we estimate to be plausible achieving an efficiency of 49.8% at 1,500 suns, owing to reduced transmission and thermalization losses.”
The bandgap of a semiconductor device such as a solar cell determines how many photons are needed from the sun for conduction. Crystalline silicon (C-Si), for example, has a bandgap energy of 1.11 eV and cadmium telluride (CdTe), which is less efficient than C-Si for power generation, has a bandgap of 1.44 eV.
The cell was monolithically grown on GaAs by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The performance of the multi-junction device was measured through a commercial steady‐state OAI 7‐kW TriSOL solar simulator and external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were made through an in‐house-built system. The EQE is an indicator of how well the solar cell converts incident photons of a specific wavelength to electricity. “The 4J solar cell exhibited an efficiency of 39% at 560‐sun illumination while showing good electrical performance even up to 1,000 suns with open-circuit voltage (Voc) of over 4.1 V,” the researchers stated.
To further improve the performance of the solar cell, the Finnish group is investigating the potential of combining aluminum-gallium-indium-phosphide (AlGaInP) subcells, which have a bandgap of over 2 eV, with GaInNAsSb substrates with a bandgap lower than 0.8 eV.
The cost of producing solar cells based on compounds of III-V element materials–named according to the groups of the periodic table that they belong to–has confined such devices to niche applications including drones and satellites, where low weight and high efficiency are more pressing concerns than costs, in relation to the energy produced.
*The article was amended to reflect that the element used for two of the cell junctions is gallium-indium-nitride-arsenide-antimony (GaInNAsSb) and not gallium-indium-sodium sulfide–antimony, as we previously reported.

AGL Energy has agreed to acquire two leading C&I solar businesses, Epho and Solgen Energy Group, as part of the Australian utility's plan to establish its relevance in a renewably powered world.
Nonetheless, the energy giant was ranked Australia’s biggest polluter by the Clean Energy Regulator in February, as it emitted more than 42 million tons of carbon last year. AGL also announced a statutory loss of AUD 2.87 billion ($2.2 billion) after tax for the year to Dec. 31, 2020.
Keen to shake its ugly past, the acquisition will give AGL a foothold in rooftop solar’s increasingly lucrative commercial segment.
“With these acquisitions, we will have the systems and technologies in place to deliver more than 70 MW of commercial solar each year, providing a combined revenue of over $150 million per annum,” said AGL CEO and Managing Director Brett Redman. “This part of the energy sector has seen significant growth over the last 10 years, as businesses right across Australia seek out solar offerings to help them decarbonise, reduce costs and create sustainable operations.”
Solgen, established in 2008, is a wholesale distribution, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) business. It has delivered more than 15,000 projects over the past decade. Solgen Energy Group CEO David Brown said the acquisition will help the company to grow.
“This will allow us to provide more customers with best-in-market commercial energy solutions throughout Australia – this group will play a leading role in the future of the broader, national solar energy market,” Brown said.
Epho, formed in 2014, specializes in the construction and maintenance of large-scale systems. It has delivered more than 400 projects nationwide. It has also developed its proprietary Bright Thinkers Power Station technology, which allows large rooftop solar systems to be connected behind the meter.
