Antora Energy received a grant for over $4 million from the California Energy Commission (CEC) to scale up its heat-to-power thermophotovoltaic technology, which can store renewable power as heat in blocks of solid carbon.
Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) is a power generation technology that uses thermal radiation to generate electricity in photovoltaic cells. A TPV system generally consists of a thermal emitter that can reach high temperatures, near or beyond 1,000 C, and a photovoltaic diode cell that can absorb photons coming from the heat source.
The technology has drawn the interest of scientists for decades, because it is able to capture sunlight in the entire solar spectrum and has the technical potential to beat the Shockley-Queisser limit of traditional photovoltaics. However, the efficiencies reported thus far have been too low to make it commercially viable, as TPV devices still suffer from optical and thermal losses.
Antora said the funding comes from the CEC’s Electric Program Investment Charge (EPIC) program and another program at the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy.
The additional funding will further accelerate Antora Energy’s production of thermophotovoltaic technology, or TPV, Andrew Ponec, the company’s co-founder and CEO, said. “With TPV, Antora is capable of decarbonizing the entire energy demand of large industrial facilities—both heat and power—opening the fastest, least expensive path for the industrial sector to reach net zero,” said Ponec.
“Industrial emissions are among the hardest to abate and Antora’s cutting-edge technology holds promise in overcoming that challenge,” Jonah Steinbuck, R&D director at the CEC, said.
The company’s thermophotovoltaic technology essentially converts heat to electricity with no moving parts, Brendan Kayes, its head of photovoltaics research and development, told pv magazine USA. “Much like a solar cell is designed to capture light from the sun, TPV cells convert the light emitted from glowing-hot objects—like Antora Energy’s carbon blocks—into electricity,” Kayes said.
Antora Energy says its thermal batteries offer a cost-effective way to store energy and produce high-temperature industrial heat and electricity on demand. So far, processes that convert heat into electricity have historically required extensive machinery with lots of moving parts, Kayes said.
“Think steam turbines and internal combustion engines—technologies that have dominated for centuries—that require expensive, ongoing maintenance, and are only efficient and cost-effective at large scale,” Kayes said.
Antora Energy’s thermophotovoltaic cells, however, are modular and manufacturable, so their efficiency and cost are reportedly independent of scale — enabling cost-effective deployments from kilowatts to gigawatts, Kayes added. This means it could help replace the use of fossil fuels in processes in the food and beverage, paper products, chemicals, steel and cement industries.
The company’s technology has met two thresholds around efficiency and manufacturing at scale, it says – it has demonstrated heat-to-electricity conversion efficiencies higher than 40%, and earlier this year, set up a dedicated manufacturing line for thermophotovoltaic cells that is the first of its kind in the world. The manufacturing line is located in Sunnyvale, California and has an initial capacity of 2 MW of cells per year.
The thermal batteries are built to address energy needs across virtually every industrial sector, and could have major ramifications in sectors beyond manufacturing, including the electric grid, remote power and others, Kayes said.
Last December, Antora Energy announced it had acquired Medley Thermal – a developer and software company specializing in renewable power-to-heat systems – to help commercialize its heat and power technology. Medley Thermal had previously developed projects that used renewables to cost-effectively electrify heat, and had a robust pipeline of power-to-heat projects, Antora Energy said.

Kenyan startup Inno Neat has developed a solar-powered water filter that removes contaminants such as bacteria, viruses and heavy metals.
The company claims to have already deployed three prototypes of “SafiSolar” for women’s groups in western Kenya. The units reportedly provide an average of 5,000 liters of drinking water to around 250 homes daily.
“Over the next two to five years, we aim to expand our impact by expanding to more communities in Kenya and beyond. This expansion will be facilitated by strategic partnerships, increased production and continued innovation to make our solution even more efficient and accessible,” said founder and CEO Godfrey Katiambo.
The solution will be billed via a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system in order to address low-income communities. Indeed, without financial capacity, these households cannot equip themselves with this type of expensive equipment. Inno-Neat intends to bill them on a per-deal basis, monthly or weekly, and via existing PAYG solutions which offer a rental model based essentially on mobile money.
The distribution of the product will be carried out through direct sales and partnerships with community associations, NGOs and local authorities. Inno Neat plans to earn revenue from the sale of SafiSolar systems and replacement filters and estimates recurring revenue potential through ongoing maintenance and ancillary services.
To finance its development, the company hopes to raise $250,000 via a fundraiser that it launched on its website.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/15/french-government-edf-agree-on-e70-mwh-for-nuclear-power/,"MARKETS,FRANCE",GWÉNAËLLE DEBOUTTE,"NOVEMBER 15, 2023","French government, EDF agree on €70 MWh for nuclear power","From pv magazine France
The French government and utility EDF have reached an agreement on the price of nuclear energy after “long, sometimes difficult negotiations,” according to Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. The new average price for nuclear power was set at €70 ($76.10)/MWh for a period of 15 years starting from 2026.
The new pricing scheme will replace the so-called Regulated Access to Incumbent Nuclear Electricity (ARENH) mechanism, which requires EDF to sell 100 TWh per year of nuclear production to its competitors at €42/MWh. EDF currently owns and operates the France's nuclear power fleet and sees the current price as two low, given current market prices for electricity.
The government and EDF determined €70/MWh by modeling prices over 15 years, considering capture and redistribution mechanisms, bilateral power purchase agreements (PPAs), and medium-term contracts. Two levels were established: if the average price surpasses €78.80/MWh, 50% of the additional income beyond this threshold goes to the state budget; exceeding €110/MWh results in a 90% capture, with surpluses returned to consumers.
“If this agreement secures EDF – the armed arm of our energy policy – over the long term, it also sets the non-negotiable conditions for electricity produced in France at a price competitive,” said Agnès Pannier-Runacher, minister of energy transition.
Yann Dolbeau, co-founder of consulting firm Enoptea, said that the mechanism would successfully disconnect the electricity price from gas prices. Consequently, there won't be any more capping, and the portion of nuclear power in supply prices will increase, leading to lower costs.
CLEEE, the French association of energy-intensive businesses, has defined the new measure as “a big step backwards” for French companies. “The new system will guarantee EDF an expected income well above the full production cost, with a retrocession threshold to consumers equal to almost double the production cost,” said CLEEE.
CRE, the French regulator, estimated the full cost of existing nuclear power at €60/MWh between 2026 and 2030. Compared to the threshold of €110/MWh, it is almost double.
“If we share the need to give EDF the means to invest, we regret an arbitration made for budgetary reasons to the detriment of price stability and the protection of French industry. A bill must soon be tabled by the government and detractors still hope to be able to influence certain aspects of the reform,” the association stated.

“The newly released product integrated full back interconnection along with non-destructive cutting and high-density encapsulation, elegantly blending aesthetics and efficiency while enhancing reliability and durability,” a Hanersun spokesperson told pv magazine.
The Chinese solar module manufacturer said that the first of the two series is called Hitouch 5A HN18A-72H. It includes five-panel versions with an output ranging from 580 W to 600 W and a power conversion efficiency spanning from 22.5% to 23.2%. The open-circuit voltage is between 39.13 V and 39.93V, and the short-circuit current is from 14.15 A to 14.45 A. They measure 2,278 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh 27.2 kg.
The second series, Hitouch 5A HN18A-54H, includes five products with an output of 430 W to 450 W and an efficiency ranging from 22.0% to 23.0%. The open-circuit voltage is between 52.21 V and 52.81 V, and the short-circuit current is from 14.20 A to 14.46 A. The panels measure 1,722 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh in at 20.8 kg.
The two panel lines can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and operating temperatures of -40 C to 85 C. They feature a waterproof junction box with an IP68 rating, a frame made of anodized aluminum alloy, and a temperature coefficient of -0.29%.
The manufacturer provides a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. It assures at least 88.9% performance retention after 25 years.
“The 182 mm silicon wafers of this series provide broad system compatibility with various mounting structures and inverters,” the spokesperson said. “The full back interconnection design enhances micro-crack resistance and lowers hot spot risk for a safer, more reliable performance.”
Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said the modules are 5N when they are 5A. The story also said the new modules recorded 0.29% temperature coefficient levels when it is -0.29%. We also incorrectly reported the open-circuit voltage is between 52.21 V and 52.81 V and the short-circuit current is from 14.20 A to 14.46 A. The open-circuit voltage is really between 39.13 V and 39.93 V and the short-circuit current is from 14.15 A to 14.45 A.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/15/ireland-holds-firm-on-8-gw-of-solar-by-2030-target/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,IRELAND",ANGELA SKUJINS,"NOVEMBER 15, 2023",Ireland holds firm on 8 GW of solar by 2030 target,"The Irish government said this week that it expects to install 8 GW of solar by 2030. The government said PV should reach existing levels of onshore wind – roughly 4.5 GW – by the mid-late decade.
The comments were published in Ireland’s strategy to achieve energy security, “Energy Security in Ireland to 2030.” Under the auspices of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the government said that Ireland will hit the 8 GW target through existing instruments, such as the RESS and microgeneration supports, as well as a new initiative, the SRESS, to be rolled out next year.
Conall Bolger, CEO of the Irish Solar Energy Association (ISEA), recently criticized the RESS scheme to pv magazine for its “high rate” of project attrition. According to his calculations, 1,534 MW of solar was awarded in the latest round (RESS 2) but there have not been enough project announcements to suggest finalization.
SRESS, to be launched next year, aims to support larger non-domestic renewables self-consumers, such as farms, public buildings, commercial and industrial entities, the government said in another report. The scheme would also provide “a route to market” for renewable energy communities and other small-scale solar PV developments of up to 6 MW installed capacity.
“SRESS will have an important role in ensuring the security of Ireland’s electricity supply into the future, by both enabling energy users to produce their own renewable electricity for their own use – and thereby reduce demand on the electricity network – and providing a route to market for small-scale renewable electricity generators,” the government said in the document.
SRESS will be divided into two streams. The first will be a grant to develop renewable self-consumers from 50 kW up to 1 MW. The second is a floating feed-in-tariff premium scheme without an auction for community, local and small and medium-sized enterprise projects between 1 MW and 6 MW. It would also include export-only projects below 1 MW.
The Irish government established the goal of 8 GW solar installed capacity by 2030 last year when the published its “Climate Action Plan 2023”.
In Ireland around 680 MW of solar power has been deployed across 59,888 generators, according to a recent report by ISEA. Most of this capacity originates from seven large-scale plants surpassing 5 MW totaling 349 MW. Roughly 208 MW comes from microgeneration solar arrays encompassing systems of up to 12 kW.
The Irish government aims for 80% of its energy market to come from renewables by 2030.

The European Commission has approved Italy's €1.7 billion scheme for agrivoltaics. The program is designed to deploy 1.04 GW of installed solar. It will also award incentives to agricultural businesses in the form of one-time investment grants and 20-year tariffs.
The Italian government has allocated €1.1 billion for investment grants that will cover up to 40% of a project's total costs and €560 million for the tariffs.
“These tariffs will be determined through a competitive bidding process on a pay-as-bid rule and will take the form of two-way contracts for difference,” said the European Commission. “The support will cover the difference between the incentive tariffs and the energy prices. In case of high energy prices, a claw-back mechanism is in place so that any amount exceeding the incentive tariffs will be paid back.”
Projects selected through the program will have to be operational before June 30, 2026.
“This €1.7 billion scheme, partially funded by the Recovery and Resilience Facility, enables Italy to support a more efficient use of land by combining agriculture with renewable energy production,” said Commissioner Didier Reynders, who is in charge of competition policy. “It will contribute to the greening of the agricultural sector and to the transition to climate neutrality, in line with the EU Green Deal objectives.”

Mozambique security forces have fought militant jihadists in the gas-rich Cabo Delgado province since 2017. According to the non-governmental organization the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), over 4,330 people have died in the conflict and almost one million people have been displaced.
Van Zuylen, who heads up the continent’s 80-member strong solar association, told pv magazine that solar businesses such as SolarCentury, ACWA Power and Globeleq are currently operating in the country, among others.
The solar expert said that although some foreign companies and investors may be discouraged from doing business in the area due to the insurgency, others may not be “perceiving that risk”.
“It probably limits some of the international companies to really consider Mozambique, but then again, it also attracts other companies, which would otherwise not be interested,” he said. “You also have developers who are looking for that risk element because they know that in exchange of that risk they may demand a higher level of return on their investment.”
Asked about the moral implications of investing in countries with high levels of instability, Van Zuyle said that AFSIA does not judge the internal decisions made by private companies or public institutions. “I did not say that some companies exploit a conflict for financial gain. Saying this would be incorrect. Different companies evaluate country and project risks on a different basis and have a different perception of risk levels on various factors.”
Speaking more broadly about Mozambique’s solar sector, van Zuylen said the PV industry is growing due to the discovery of gas which “fuels everything”. In November 2022 the President of Mozambique Filipe Jacinto Nyusi inaugurated the solar Coral-Sul FLNG installation, located at the northern Rovuma Basin, which is expected to generate 500 billion m3 of natural gas.
But van Zuylen also credited the country's success to political will.
According to Brussels-based solar analytical firm SolarPower Europe, Mozambique's “huge solar potential” is starting to be realized due to recent reforms. The most noticeable is the Renewable Energy Auctions Programme (PROLER) set up in 2020 by the Mozambique government with funding from the European Union.
PROLER’s main goal is to tender four renewable energy projects – three solar and one wind – with a unit capacity of 30 MW to 50 MW interconnected to the grid, the program’s website said. The aim is to facilitate 120 MW of renewable energy projects.
Mozambique recorded 108 MW of solar installed capacity at the end of last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). But this is almost double the capacity of the year before (64 MW).
Major projects in the country include the 19 MW Cuamba solar PV and 7 MW energy storage plant in Cuamba, in the country’s north, which was switched on two months ago. The project is managed by independent power producer Globeleq and Mozambique’s national utility, Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM), among others.
Van Zuylen said major utility-scale projects are driving the country's solar success and they are only possible with government backing, such as the PROLER scheme.
He said the commercial and industrial PV sector is another major industry driver and is being led by affordable solar and storage equipment prices. “More and more people are now in a position to say solar-plus-storage has become a viable source for them,” he said. “They've been facing the same issues with unreliable or lack of electricity supply on the grid and so because they're businesspeople, they need to conduct business and when a solution finally becomes viable, they don't think too long.”
One of the biggest issues facing the local PV sector is the language barrier, van Zuylen said. Not enough people in the international development community speak Portuguese and not enough people in Mozambique speak English. “I don't have factual evidence to prove this, but I know that this is a limiting aspect,” he said.
Van Zuylen said that a decade ago, the Mozambique government rolled out a favorable feed-in tariff scheme for solar installations. He said at the time it was one of the most progressive incentive programs of its kind in Africa. But because the notification was written in Portuguese, “very few people” were taking advantage of it, he said.
Despite this, now, “clearly, there is activity,” he said. “There's a lot to be done in the country. A lot to be built. And it's also growing now, the economy's growing.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/15/california-to-use-flexible-appliances-for-renewable-energy-integration/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,CALIFORNIA,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"NOVEMBER 15, 2023",California to use flexible appliances for renewable energy integration,"From pv magazine USA
New flexible demand appliance standards are “coming down the road” in California for water heaters, behind-the-meter batteries, and electric vehicle chargers, said California Energy Commission (CEC) Commissioner Andrew McAllister at a CalFlexHub symposium.
CalFlexHub is a proving ground for flexible load technologies at Berkeley Lab, funded by the CEC, that is evaluating 12 technologies for flexible demand, in collaboration with manufacturers. After setting flexible demand appliance standards for pool controls in October, the CEC expects to open a dialogue on a new appliance category every six months, said a spokesperson.
McAllister said he expects that a rulemaking for electric water heaters will be “in full swing” by late 2024. Ten of the largest heat pump manufacturers have committed to help California reach its goal of 6 million heat pumps for water or space heating by 2030, he said.
California’s standards for pool controls, which McAllister said have created a template for future standards, will require new equipment to default to flexible demand, yet allow the customer to override that setting. Maintaining the default flexible demand setting will save customers money on their electric bills, as the appliance will operate more often on lower-cost renewable generation.
Mary Ann Piette, who leads CalFlexHub, said one concern is whether that lower cost of operation will motivate adoption of flexible demand appliances. She suggested that adding an emergency demand response capability with customer compensation would “provide the most value … We believe that flexible load in many cases will be more cost-effective than installing a battery.” She also noted that CalFlexHub is exploring heat pumps with thermal storage.
As the CEC sets standards for appliances that can respond to flexible rates – such as lower rates when renewable generation is high – the California Public Utilities Commission is working with the state’s utilities to develop flexible rates. The CPUC aims for the state’s investor-owned utilities to offer hourly marginal cost-based rates and programs by January 2027, according to a slide that McAllister presented.
McAllister said that for California to reach its goal of 7 GW of load flexibility, the state aims to combine 3 GW of price-responsive demand from appliances with 4 GW of traditional demand response, in which some customers “drop load” during the 100 highest-demand hours of the year.
“People are so excited globally about what we’re doing with load flex,” McAllister said. “I mean, the word is out, and the light bulb goes on.” People decide, he said, “Of course we’re doing that; that makes sense, and we really want to learn from what California is doing.”
The CEC said it foresees a future that goes beyond flexible demand to “transactive energy.” While flexible demand involves one-way communication of rates from utilities, through a state database known as MIDAS, to appliances, transactive energy would involve appliances with two-way communication capability, enabling electric vehicles, for example, to send energy stored in the battery back to the grid.
Noting that California’s grid is set to become carbon-free by 2045, McAllister said that in the near term, “load flex is going to help decarbonize,” and over the long term, “load flex is going to help us optimally run the grid when it is 100% carbon-free.”
California’s work on flexible rates builds on analytical support provided by a white paper by the CPUC energy division staff and an analysis of potential cost savings from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
Recordings and slides from the CalFlexHub symposium are expected to be made available later this month, said a Berkeley Lab spokesperson.
