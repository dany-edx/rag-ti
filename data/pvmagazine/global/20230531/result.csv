The record took place between 1:00 pm and 1:30 pm. Together, solar and wind generated 8,303 MW of electricity on Monday, beating Sunday’s record of 7,695 MW, Elia wrote in a post on its LinkedIn channel. Last year’s record stood at 7,112 MW on May 11.
Solar’s share of the record electricity generation was substantially higher than wind’s, at around 5,500 MW according to a graph posted by Elia.
“Moments like this highlight the need for a new market model which incentives flexible consumption,” the system operator said. “Under such a model, consumers with flexible appliances such as heat pumps and electric cars will be able to charge their appliances when there is lots of cheap, green electricity available at the same time as helping to keep the grid in balance.”

“The issue of VAT on batteries being installed after solar panels is an issue that has been raised multiple times within our Committee’s work,” said Hon Philip Dunne, the chairman of the UK Environmental Audit Committee. “I am therefore very pleased that this is being considered in the Government’s consultation on VAT on energy-saving materials, and the Committee will be making representations to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to highlight the evidence we have taken on this issue.”
The committee did not say when the new measure may come into force. “The VAT measure means that battery storage supplied as part of installation of a qualifying material will benefit from a VAT zero rate for the next 5 years,” it specified in a document describing all measures the government is intending to take to support residential PV.
These include the recommendation that newly constructed housing incorporate solar PV as a minimum requirement, the setting of more ambitious installation targets on the path to 2035, and other proposals to solve skills and supply chain issues.
The British government had already slashed to zero the VAT on rooftop PV and heat pumps in March.

However, challenges, such as calcium metal passivation by electrolytes and a lack of cathode materials with efficient calcium ions storage capabilities, impede the technology’s practical development.
To overcome these limitations, researchers at Tohoku University in Japan recently developed a prototype calcium metal rechargeable battery capable of more than 500 cycles of repeated charging and discharging. The battery was developed with a hydride-based electrolyte and copper sulfide (CuS) nanoparticle/carbon composite cathode. It demonstrated better performance than state-of-the-art calcium metal batteries in terms of both the rate capability and cycle life.
The combination of a CuS/C nanocomposite and a tailored monocarborane electrolyte solution of Ca(CB11H12)2 in dimethoxyethane/tetrahydrofuran (DME/THF) enabled a calcium metal battery with capacity retention of 92% based on the capacity of the 10th cycle.
“This study confirms the feasibility of the long-term operation of Ca metal anodes and can expedite the development of Ca metal batteries,” the researchers wrote in “Calcium Metal Batteries with Long Life Using a Hydride-Based Electrolyte and Copper Sulfide Electrode,” which was recently published in Advanced Science.

Yet the widespread use of these batteries faces hurdles that stem mainly from the limitations in the lifespan of lithium-sulfur cells.
In a bid to bring this technology closer to commercialization, Australian listed company Li-S Energy has announced the development of its first 20-layer battery cells utilizing third-generation (GEN3) semi-solid state lithium sulfur battery technology.
Li-S Energy has been working with Victoria’s Deakin University and PPK Group, among others, to develop the new battery cells, which eliminate the heavy metals like nickel, cobalt and manganese used in lithium-ion batteries.
Li-S Energy’s cell is said to offer volumetric energy density of 540 Wh/l, gravimetric energy density of more than 400 Wh/kg and enhanced safety with the use of a low flammability electrolyte.
The GEN3 battery cell has major advantages over the second-generation iteration, including a 45% increase in volumetric energy density thanks to the use of a lower-porosity cathode material.
Compared to current Li-ion cells, this performance is nearly double the gravimetric energy density and a comparable volumetric energy density. This means that Li-S Energy’s battery cells are now the same size as existing Li-ion batteries but half the weight, the company claims.
The 20-layer cells use Li-S Energy’s patented Li-nanomesh technology and incorporate boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) into the cell construction to reduce dendrite growth and improve safety and cycle life. Test cells have demonstrated sustained performance over 1,000 charge-and-discharge cycles while retaining a specific capacity almost three times that of a typical lithium-ion cell.
The new cells were produced in Li-S Energy’s Phase 2 facility in Geelong, Victoria, where test cell production is anticipated later this year, once the company’s Phase 3 facility is complete. Phase 3 is a 2 MWh production line, which will enable more automated production and include what is potentially the largest dry room in Australia.
“In the coming months we look forward to commencing the production of commercial samples for our partners,” says Li-S Energy CEO, Lee Finniear.
At this point, the Li-S Energy development team is working to develop the cell cycle testing and characterization results to produce an industry standard datasheet on the new 20-layer cells.
Li-S Energy has identified electric aviation and drones as key sector where it has a competitive advantage due to the light weight of its batteries. In 2022, the battery start-up inked a deal with U.S.-based e-aviation company magniX, which will test the potential of the company’s technology for e-aviation applications.

The design incorporates bilayer heterojunctions with different perovskite materials, allowing for enhanced absorption across multiple regions of the light spectrum.
They used a top absorber based on a type of lead-halide perovskite known as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and a bottom absorber made of a perovskite material known as FA0.5MA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3. The two absorbers have energy bandgaps of 1.55 eV and 1.25 eV, respectively.
The researchers also used SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells that was developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium, to simulate several cell designs.
“By varying the parameters of the absorber layers and work-function of the contacts we show improved performance for the proposed device,” the researchers said. “In addition, it is illustrated the temperature of the cell plays a significant role in the functionality of this bilayer cell.”
They said the thickness of the two layers has a significant effect on the performance of the bilayer cell and the thickness of the wide bandgap absorber layer should be thinner than the narrow bandgap.
“The best thickness for MAPbI3 and FA0.5MA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 is 100 nm and 600 nm, respectively,” they said.
The scientists designed the solar cell with a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), a hole-transporting material (HTM) based on PEDOT:PSS, the two absorbers, an electron acceptor made of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), and a metal contact made of aluminum (Al).
Through a series of simulations conducted under standard illumination conditions, the research group found that the cell could achieve a power conversion efficiency of 24.83%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.9 V, a short-circuit current density of 34.76 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 79.4%.
The scientists introduced the new cell technology in “Performance analyses of highly efficient inverted all-perovskite bilayer solar cell,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports. The research group includes academics from the University of Tabriz in Iran and the Bilkent University in Turkey.

Meyer Burger is exploring pathways to manufacture solar cells in the United States. During an interview with investment firm Roth MKM, the company’s chief executive officer, Gunter Erfurt, suggested that its interest in domestic manufacturing had significantly increased following new guidance on the domestic content requirement.
The company said it plans to manufacture 2 GW per year of solar cells for the Goodyear, Arizona facility at its current factory locations in Germany. Erfurt indicated that Meyer Burger had secured enough manufacturing space in the German “solar valley” to reach a manufacturing capacity of up to 15 GW annually.
However, following the release of the Internal Revenue Service’s domestic content guidance on May 12, the company started looking for space to manufacture solar cells near the Arizona facility. Erfurt stated that, while there are no explicit timelines, the sooner they begin production in the U.S., the better.
When Phillip Shen from Roth MKM asked if Meyer Burger believed they could meet the 40% domestic content requirement by using a domestically manufactured solar cell in their modules, Erfurt affirmed that they did.
Meyer Burger reached out to the Loan Programs Office under the Department of Energy (DOE). Erfurt noted that the DOE aims to stimulate more solar cell manufacturing and might potentially fund the construction of a solar cell facility.
Meyer Burger currently manufactures around 800,000 solar cells per day, which fills approximately 6,000 solar modules. Once the company completes its 1.4 GW/year expansion, it’ll reach an output of about 10,000 modules per day.
Erfurt said the company has adequate resources to achieve its 3.4 GW manufacturing capacity goal, which includes the aforementioned 2 GW of solar cell manufacturing that will be needed in the near future.

With the utility-scale solar market experiencing a multi-gigawatt surge of development activity across America’s heartland states, insurers are now requiring solar developers to demonstrate mitigation strategies and protocols to address severe hail and extreme weather in new solar states.
A recent pv magazine USA webinar session showed that hail risk mitigation is a common problem in “Hail Alley,” a broad region encompassing around six states from the Dakotas to Texas, which often experience five or more days each year of catastrophic hail. Climate change has created patterns of irregularity as extreme weather increasingly crops up in regions bordering hail-prone regions.
Hail events have historically posed a considerable risk for utility solar, with weather instances creating up to $100 million in module damage at large projects in states like Texas, where hail stones the size of baseballs can pummel skyward facing modules.
Indji Systems, a Los Angeles-based meteorological software, has just launched Indji Watch, a hail detection software-as-a-service platform for solar developers. It allows end users to see and trace hail events using a predictive, real-time data framework. The software system allows stakeholders to implement effective defensive measures and safeguard their investments for the long haul.
Indji Watch automatically detects early threats and delivers notifications through its dashboard. With updates on potential hail threats delivered up to the time of storm impacts, the weather watch allows companies to actively prepare for significant events, fostering collaboration and coordinated decision-making. By prioritizing “early awareness,” Indji Systems can help mitigate risk by protecting solar sites.
Indji Watch identifies storm paths and their proximity to solar asset footprints as threats become imminent, enabling customers to take defensive measures. The warning allows solar O&M and onsite operators time to “stow,” a term used to angle the solar panels away from oncoming hailstorms to lessen the direct impact and potential damage to the crystalline panels.

The company said it will use the funds to move forward with the construction of its planned wafer factory in Bitterfeld, in the district of Anhalt-Bitterfeld, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.
“The funds come from NexWafe’s current group of investors, including Reliance New Energy Limited, Aramco Ventures and Athos Venture GmbH, as well as new investors, including the Honorable Malcolm Turnbull AC and Keshik Capital, led by Alex Turnbull,” the company said, noting that it intends to raise additional funds in the second half of this year.
The wafer manufacturer also announced a plan to build a new manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia with the support of the country's Sustainability Fund and Aramco Ventures, the investment arm of Saudi oil group Aramco.
“NexWafe’s process supports urgent U.S. and European efforts to re-shore domestic solar wafer manufacturing and cell production by increasing supply-chain sourcing diversity and resilience,” the company stated, without providing more details on the Saudi project.
In October 2021, Reliance New Energy Solar Limited (RNESL), an arm of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited, invested €25 million in NexWafe.
The manufacturer claims that its EpiWafers technology could help module producers to achieve dramatically higher degrees of efficiency, without having to upgrade their production lines. It also claims that its technology can enable the production of ultra-thin wafers. It has already demonstrated this on its pilot line in Freiburg, Germany. In addition to ultra-thin wafers, Nexwafe plans to use tandem architectures in the future.
NexWafe develops and produces monocrystalline silicon wafers grown directly from inexpensive raw materials. The continuous, direct gas-to-wafer manufacturing process obviates the need for costly and energy-intensive intermediate steps such as polysilicon production and ingot pulling on which traditional wafer manufacturing relies. The process also reportedly minimizes wastage, cutting wafer production costs by up to 30%. It also offers a 70% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions during manufacturing, according to the company.

Brisbane City Council has selected to install a Redflow battery to boost energy resilience at its Willawong Animal Rehoming Centre in Brisbane’s south.
The 30 kWh zinc-bromine flow battery project was deployed with Redflow’s new integration partner, Bright Spark Group, and includes two Deye hybrid inverters to allow for a solar system to be added in the future.
The Willawong Animal Rehoming Centre site is the first in the Brisbane City Council’s broader plan to boost resiliency at government sites across the city, dubbed the ‘Better Brisbane Proposals’ initiative. The Redflow battery system was funded through the program.
The Willawong Animal Rehoming Centre was selected for the initial site due to its ongoing issues with grid outages, which were impacting the storage of vaccines and medications.
Flow batteries are an intrinsically different beast from the predominant lithium-ion batteries, the domain of giants like Tesla. Lithium-ion batteries are solid-state batteries that store energy in metal. Flow batteries, on the other hand, store energy in electrolyte liquids. They are usually designed to have two tanks, one containing a positively-charged anode and the other with a negatively-charged cathode, separated by a membrane.
Using liquids allows flow batteries to produce electrical currents without degradation, giving the batteries a longer cycle life and allowing them to store charge for longer periods compared to lithium-ion batteries. Flow batteries can also be fully discharged without damage, and are easily scaleable – able to be fitted to one another to increase capacity.
Flow batteries also lend themselves to recycling, which is an aspect Redflow CEO and Managing Director Tim Harris thinks will become increasingly relevant for Redflow’s overall offering – especially given just 2% of Australia’s lithium-ion battery waste is currently recycled.
Flow batteries pitfall? Size. Tanks of fluid can, by nature, only be made so small. This is part of the reason lithium-ion batteries have been far quicker out the gate – we’ve needed small, high-powered batteries a lot longer than we have utility-scale ones. Despite being arguably less well suited for larger scale applications, lithium-ion batteries have benefited massively from their ubiquity and visibility, having been used for decades in our phones, laptop chargers and now in our EVs.
After years of predictions around the dawning of the flow battery age, it appears the decades-old technology is finally capturing some of the storage market. In the last year, Redflow has expanded into the US market and has integrated its systems with a wide array of inverters.
There are a number of flow battery companies and projects gearing up in Australia, including Energy Storage Industries’ manufacturing plant in Maryborough, Queensland, where it will assemble iron-flow batteries from its “deep tech partner” ESS Inc. Sydney startup Gelion, and VSUN Energy, a subsidiary of Perth-based mining company Australian Vanadium Limited (AVL), are also seeking to expand both the manufacturing and deployments of flow batteries in Australia.

The annual World Energy Investment report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that for every dollar invested in fossil fuels, $1.70 is invested in clean energy technologies. This marks a fast divergence from five years ago, when fossil fuels and clean energy investments were essentially even.
The torch is now being carried by solar, which is soon to overtake oil production said IEA. Almost 90% of new power generation investments are now tied to solar and other low-carbon technologies, said the report.
About $2.8 trillion is set to be invested in energy globally in 2023, $1.7 trillion of which will go to clean technologies, with PV leading the way as the largest contributor of energy generation. The remaining roughly $1 trillion is expected to be invested in fossil fuels. Annual clean energy investment is expected to rise by 24% between 2021 and 2023, driven by renewables and electric vehicles, compared with a 15% rise in fossil fuel investment over the same period.
Nearly $700 billion of investment is expected for renewable energy generation. Solar is the star performer with more than $1 billion per day is expected to go into solar investments in 2023. IEA expects solar investment to total $380 billion for the year as a whole, edging this spending above upstream oil for the first time.
Along with wholesale move toward clean generation is a global shift toward electrification. Global heat pump sales are growing at double-digit annual growth rates since 2021, and electric vehicles are expected to leap one-third this year after already undergoing a landmark year of growth in 2021.
China is expected to continue as the global frontrunner in clean energy investment, with increased spending of over $170 billion. The nation is followed by the European Union, with about $150 billion in increased investment, and the United States, adding about $100 billion in increased investment. Costs for clean energy edged higher in 2022, but pressures are easing in 2023, and mature clean technologies remain very cost-competitive in today’s fuel-price environment, said IEA.
China alone added over 100 GW of solar PV capacity in 2022, almost 70% higher than in 2021, and annual installations increased by 40% or more in Europe, India and Brazil, despite inflation and supply chain issues.
“While solar deployment has been increasing year-on-year, the project pipeline for some other technologies has been less reliable,” said the report. “Investment in wind power has varied year-on-year in key markets in response to changing policy circumstances. Nuclear investment is rising but hydropower, a key low-emission source of power market flexibility, has been on a downward trend.”
This investment is gaining momentum due to a powerful alignment of costs, climate, and energy security goals and industrial strategies. The recovery from the slump caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the response to the global energy crisis have provided a significant boost to clean energy investment, said IEA.
While clean technology investments are rising worldwide, work needs to be done, especially in developing economies, said IEA. Many nations are being held back by higher interest rates, unclear policy frameworks and market designs, weak grid infrastructure, financially strained utilities, and a high cost of capital. However, IEA notes that dynamic investments in solar in India, Brazil, and the Middle East are driving forward these markets.
To help address some of the above-listed headwinds, the IEA release a new report entitled Scaling Up Private Finance for Clean Energy in Emerging and Developing Economies on June 22.
Fossil fuel producers made record profits in 2022, though much of this cash flow has gone to dividends, share buybacks, and debt repayment, rather than reinvestment back into traditional supply. IEA said that while a shift to renewables is underway, fossil fuels are expected to continue to drive growth – with oil and gas spending expected to rise 7% this year. Coal demand still remains high in some markets, and the shift from these assets may not be occurring fast enough, as coal investment is pacing to be six times above what IEA envisions for its 2030 Net Zero Scenario.
IEA notes that clean energy among major oil and gas producers is continuing to rise, with solar and wind holding a similar share. Clean energy investment by these fossil fuels companies doubled in 2022 to about $20 billion. This investment represents about 4% of upstream capital and 0.5% of net income. European oil majors are outpacing U.S. oil majors considerably in this category, said IEA.
In the United States, demand to adopt solar is strong. In its 2023 Solar Snapshot report, Aurora Solar reported that 45% of solar professionals reported increased demand as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, with another 40% expecting to see increased demand soon, and 70% noted their business grew in size. Nearly 77% of homeowners either have solar or are interested in purchasing it, said Aurora Solar.
In its 2021 World Energy Outlook report, IEA noted that the world is not investing enough to meet its future energy needs. This year, it said, “this picture is starting to change: global energy investment is picking up, and the rise in clean energy investment since 2021 is leading the way, outpacing the increase in fossil fuel investment by almost three to-one.”
“If [clean energy investment] continues to grow at the rate seen since 2021, then aggregate spending in 2030 on low-emission power, grids and storage, and end-use electrification would exceed the levels required to meet the world’s announced climate pledges. For some technologies, notably solar, [investment] would match the investment required to get on track for a 1.5°C stabilization in global average temperatures,” said IEA.
