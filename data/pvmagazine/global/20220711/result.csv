The company aims to develop factories to reach mass battery cell production.
Ion Storage is developing solid-state batteries and aims to produce 10 MWh per year and generate commercial revenue by the end of 2023. The key differences to other solid-state and next-generation batteries is a bi-layer cell design. This reduces typical lithium-ion battery defects, and works with existing and next-generation cathode chemistries, avoiding the use of critical raw materials like cobalt, nickel, and gold.
Neil Ovadia, Ion’s vice-president of operations, told pv magazine that the company can target multiple markets, ranging from defense to consumer products to electric vehicles and stationary grid storage. Ovadia noted that Ion is working on a variation to the core product meant for stationary storage applications.
“Ion’s unique technology unlocks the power of solid-state batteries through its patented Bi-layer cell design. The dense ceramic electrolyte separator is connected to a porous ceramic electrolyte scaffold,” explained Ovadia. “The porous scaffold acts as a “sponge,” creating uniform and continuous pathways for lithium metal plating without external volume change, while the dense layer acts as a solid-state separator blocking lithium metal dendrites – thereby avoiding the need for compression and preventing short circuits. This architecture makes Ion’s solid-state electrolyte compatible with a wide range of existing and next-generation cathode chemistries.”
Ovadia further detailed the non-flammable materials used in the battery cell architecture.
“Ion bi-layer cell architecture is made of inexpensive, nonflammable materials and use of a lithium metal anode has been able to meet next-generation performance metrics, including high-energy density, strong cycling performance, wide temperature range, and fast charging all at room temperature and without compression,” he said.  “Its ability to utilize both existing and next generation cathode chemistries removes the need for supply constrained materials such as nickel and cobalt. The manufacturability of Ion’s technology also sets us apart as we utilize already-scaled processing and high-speed green body manufacturing techniques for our ceramic electrolyte and largely utilize existing lithium-ion manufacturing processes for cell production.”
Furthermore, the battery allows for a “cathode agnostic” approach, opening a wide range of cathode materials to be used, he said.
Ion has previously said it aims to produce more than 1 million cellphone-size batteries annually. And while those figures were not restated aain, the plan is to develop Ion’s pilot manufacturing facility at its Beltsville headquarters in 2023. It will then supply samples to interested parties and first market customers.
In terms of the struggles that companies face to scale-up production processes, Ion says it “employs existing industrial scale ceramic preparation methods.” It claims its unique structure “allows for the use of widely deployed Li-Ion battery manufacturing equipment for final cell assembly.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/11/vietnamese-government-fears-legal-action-from-solar-investors/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,VIETNAM",MAX HALL,"JULY 11, 2022",Vietnamese government fears legal action from solar investors,"Vietnam's latest draft energy plan prepares for 8.7 GW of new solar between 2021 and 2030, but the Ministry of Industry and Trade is reportedly fearful of action by investors in another 2.4 GW of projects that have been built or approved.
VN Express International reported this week that 2,428 MW of solar capacity above what is set out in the nation's draft power plan has been built or has secured planning consent. The news site reported that the draft version of Vietnam's eighth power development plan, drawn up in March 2021, includes a target for 8.7 GW of new solar additions between 2021 and 2030.
According to the news outlet, some 11,164 MW of solar capacity is already in place or has been approved. And the Ministry of Industry and Trade is pushing for it all to be included in the masterplan, in order to avoid investors suing the government.
VN Express reported that the government has yet to approve the power plan, as it needs to be updated, including to reflect the net-zero-by-mid-century pledge made by Hanoi at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow last December. The news site said that thermal power, hydro, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) are set to dominate the Vietnamese power mix under the draft plan.
International Finance Corp. (IFC), the private-sector arm of the World Bank, recently noted that the 36 GW of clean energy generation envisaged by the October draft of the power plan would still be smaller than a planned 38 GW of coal power plants, up from 20 GW in 2020. The IFC said that Vietnam could use LNG as a bridge energy source for its power transition.
Separately, Vietnam Plus reported last week that state-owned utility Vietnam Electricity is pushing Hanoi to introduce regulations for rooftop solar. The company reportedly wants to add 1.5 GW of solar by 2025, with a focus on the poorer northern part of the country.
A feed-in tariff for grid-connected solar drove expansion in the industry, with the 8 MW the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimated the country had at the end of 2017 rising to 105 MW a year later. The cumulative total hit 4.99 GW in 2019 and 16.7 GW in 2020.
The IFC has criticized the lack of an auction system to follow up the FIT program. Its assessment appears to be borne out by IRENA's estimate that no new grid solar capacity was installed in 2021.

Its new company, PowerCo., is scheduled to start production in 2025. It aims to eventually reach an annual capacity of 40 GWh, which is enough for about 500,000 electric vehicles. The Salzgitter cell factory will serve as a blueprint for the German car manufacturer’s “global battery offensive.” It plans to establish six cell factories in Europe with a total volume of 240 GWh, with potential plans to expand into North America. The factories will run on 100% renewable electricity, with plans for future closed-loop recycling.
Northvolt has revealed that it will use a $1.1 billion convertible note to finance the “expansion of battery cell and cathode material production in Europe to support the rapidly expanding demand for batteries.” The Swedish manufacturer – which aims to provide “the world’s greenest battery” – has secured the backing of investors such as Volkswagen and Goldman Sachs. It said that it wants 50% of its raw material requirements to be sourced from recycled batteries by 2030. It is now developing manufacturing capacity to deliver on $55 billion of orders from a range of key customers, including BMW, Fluence, Scania, Volvo Cars, and Volkswagen.
Mercedez-Benz Energy has signed an agreement with Canadian startup Moment Energy to use its electric-vehicle batteries in second-life stationary storage applications. Moment Energy will integrate retired Mercedes-Benz batteries into its new 60 kWh energy storage systems. It plans to deploy two systems later this year at God’s Pocket Resort, a Canadian off-grid dive resort that is currently being powered by diesel generators.  Moment Energy’s scalable 60 kWh modules operate at either 480 V or 208 V and are said to offer a rated power output of 40 kVA to 320 kVA. Earlier this year, Mercedes-Benz agreed to supply its used EV batteries to Swedish startup BatteryLoop.
OPES Solutions has set up a customized assembly line to directly integrate 365 W solar modules onto the rooftops of Westfalia camper vans. The line went into operation at the beginning of the year at the Westfalen Mobil in Rheda-Wiedenbrück, Germany. OPES Solutions designed the light, frameless solar modules in collaboration with Fraunhofer CSP. The manufacturer said the thin solar panels can withstand extreme climate conditions and vibration. The modules send power to the batteries through an MPPT charge controller. “Vehicle-integrated photovoltaic is not only about developing and manufacturing suitable solar technology, but always about the holistic approach to a complete solution,” said OPES Solutions CEO Robert Händel.
SAIC Motor has set up a joint laboratory with Chinese startup ChingTao Energy Development to develop solid-state batteries for application in electric vehicles by as early as next year. The Shanghai-based automaker said the new lab will focus on the mass production of solid-state batteries with ranges of more than 1,000 kilometers and 4C fast-charging technology. ChingTao Energy recently began building a 10 GWh solid-state battery factory in Kunshan, in China's Jiangsu province. It will be the company’s second factory, following the opening of a 1 GWh solid-state lithium battery production line in 2020.

What are the roles of solar and energy storage in delivering conflict-free clean energy and how can roadblocks to deployment be overcome by smart strategies and policies? Session 1, A clean and free Europe sought to answer these questions.

We were joined by Pablo Collado, CEO of Renovables Europa Norte&Centro at Iberdrola, which is not only a global energy supplier from Spain but also a global player in PV expansion; Dries Acke, Policy Director at Solar Power Europe; and Moritz Borgmann, CCO at Meyer Burger, one of the pioneers in new generation European cell and module manufacturing.
Questions addressed the roadblocks existing in the EU in general and in Spain, France, Italy, and Germany in particular. How can they be removed? How can module supply be secured? And how can the solar industry contribute to energy security in Europe? Find out more by watching the video above.
Until now, corporate sustainability has been measured by the voluntary triple bottom line approach of people, profit, and the planet. With the formation of the EU sustainable taxonomy, ESG or Environmental, Social, and Governance, however, a new framework has been devised with the aim to hold companies more accountable when it comes to the effects of their operations on the wider world.
This shift is seeing record levels of cash injected into “green” finance with investors starting to call for more concrete proof of a company’s sustainability operations, as the first speaker, Maia Godemer, sustainable finance associate at BloombergNEF attested to.

A panel of experts – Adele Zhao, Head of Product Solutions & Marketing, Europe, Trina Solar; Inés Monroy, Global Business Development & Brand Manager, Steag Solar Energy Solutions; Maria Franco, Associate Professor, Circular Economy, Bern University of Applied Sciences; and Alison Lennon, Chief Scientist, Sundrive Solar, Adjunct Professor, UNSW – then joined us for a discussion on how solar companies can meet ESG criteria and prepare for increasingly rigorous standards, and circularity in manufacturing and pathways to overcome material bottlenecks.
Electrifying homes has become a powerful lever in the decarbonization toolkit. How can solar suppliers and businesses meet the complex needs of fully electric households and what needs to change? The third session on How to decarbonize homes today addressed these questions.

In addition to presentations by Jaron Schächter, Vice President Strategy at SolarEdge on Unlocking the home as a decarbonization hub, and Insan Boy, Vice President Global Sales at Seraphim Solar on Modules to meet the residential customer needs, we also hosted a panel with Schächter, Boy, Syavash Kazemi, Data Scientist at Tibber, and Wolfgang Gründinger, Chief Evangelist at Enpal looking at energy management across segments and as solar penetration grows.
The themes addressed during the fourth pv magazine Roundtables Europe session, Made in Europe addressed:

Sebastian Gatz, Vice President Photovoltaics at Von Ardenne; Peter Handschack, Managing Director at ISRA VISION; Walburga Hemetsberger CEO at SolarPower Europe; Nicola Rossi Head of Innovation at Enel Green Power; Carsten Rohr Chief Commercial Officer at NorSun; and Žygimantas Vaičiūnas, Policy Director at ESMC joined us for discussions on producing the PV cells to power Europe’s solar manufacturing future, the PV manufacturers already underway in Europe, implementing a European solar supply chain, and European PV manufacturing projects in 2022.
The prospects for vehicle-integrated PV to provide meaningful benefits for electric cars, trucks, and buses have never been higher. Increasing solar cell efficiency means generating more power from a smaller surface area and at lower cost, resulting in opportunities from sectors further afield: High-efficiency cell makers, custom module manufacturers, testing equipment and inverter manufacturers, and more are all eyeing up the VIPV space.

India's AmpereHour Energy has released MoviGEN, a new plug-and-play mobile energy storage system. The lithium-ion-based system provides on-demand electrical energy and replaces the need for movable fossil-fuel-based power generators.
The target applications include power for construction sites, outdoor events, on-demand electric vehicle charging, and disaster relief. MoviGEN is non-polluting and much quieter than diesel generators. Other advantages include lower operating costs and less maintenance.
“MoviGEN is scalable on both power and energy (battery capacity) ratings. The systems can range from 5 kW/10 kWh to 200 kW/400 kWh. We also provide customized solutions for power and energy ratings beyond 200 kW/400 kWh based on the application,” AmpereHour Energy CEO Ayush Misra told pv magazine.  “The charging time would vary based on the system’s power rating.”
MoviGEN system comes with AmpereHour’s energy management platform, which facilitates remote management and control of MoviGEN via its Elina software platform. The software facilitates real-time monitoring of many system parameters, enabling future optimization and safe operation.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/11/pem-electrolysis-coupled-with-thermal-energy-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 11, 2022",PEM electrolysis coupled with thermal energy storage,"A research group from China has shown how proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis could be combined with thermal energy storage to maintain a high-efficiency operating range for electrolyzers when renewable energy is connected to hydrogen production systems.
PEM electrolyzers cannot maintain stable operating temperatures as input power changes, as the polarization curve distorts with the change of temperature.
“This work proposes a PEM electrolyzer coupled with the thermal energy storage device to meet power fluctuation and frequent start and stop caused by renewable resources,” the scientists said.

The proposed system consists of a 60 kW PEM electrolyzer, a water separation subsystem, a purification subsystem, a heat storage subsystem, a pressurizing subsystem, and a controlling and monitoring subsystem. It can operate in normal mode and power fluctuation mode.
“A throttle valve is used to reduce pressure at the outlet of the oxygen path,” the team said. “Concentration detection and alarm devices are also installed around the platform to ensure the test safety.”
The water separation subsystem consists of hydrogen separators and oxygen separators.
“Hydrogen and oxygen flow out from cathode and anode, respectively, with a certain proportion of liquid water, and enter the primary separator for gas-liquid separation,” the academics said. “The function of the separator is to make the gas change direction suddenly in the flow, separating water droplets from the gas.”

The heat storage subsystem can store heat through a plate heat exchanger. This heat can then be used for PEM electrolysis when input power fluctuates. The pressurizing subsystem is used to overcome the resistance loss of the circulating water system, which makes the water continuously flow in the loop.
The scientists tested the system maintaining the water flow into the electrolyzer at 200 mL per minute per cell. They found that it presented a higher current density under the same power consumption, leading to a higher hydrogen yield.
“The inlet water temperature of electrolyzer reached around 58 C in 30 seconds and promoted the electrolytic system to run quickly and persistently in an efficient condition,” they said. “Meanwhile, the coupled system can effectively reduce electrolytic voltages during the process of start-stop or load changing, and the maximum difference of power consumption per cell can reach around 12 W.”
They presented their findings in “Experimental and Analytical Study of a Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyser Integrated with Thermal Energy Storage for Performance Enhancement,” which was recently published in the International Journal of Photoenergy.
“The coupled system effectively reduces energy consumption in the process of start-stop or load changing, which can effectively adapt to the power fluctuation and frequent start and stop caused by renewable energy,” the scientists said.

The system is compatible with the inverters of Solaredge, Solax, Kostal, Fiemer, Fronius, and other manufacturers. It is also compatible with more than 20 heat pumps.
“If the compatibility to the available devices is given, our system can work either with residential or commercial installations,” CEO Andreas Kuhn told pv magazine.
The Solar Manager system can be used with a mobile app that allows people to visualize household consumption data in real time. It also offers an overview of the past seven days to show amounts of generated and self-consumed solar energy, as well as how much electricity has been purchased from the grid.
 
The system supports two different ways to integrate a heat pump with a PV system: integration via a relay contact or via two relay contacts. With the latter, the heat pump can immediately react when surplus solar power is available.

Some heat pumps support integration via the internet, which enables finer control, as precise values can be transmitted via a LAN interface. This interface offers bidirectional communication.
With the Solar Manager, the heat pump uses PV electricity during the day. “The system can be bought either with a PV system or a heat pump,” Kuhn explained. “Nearly 5,000 systems are now installed in Switzerland.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/11/environmental-impacts-of-perovskite-pv/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JULY 11, 2022",Environmental impacts of perovskite PV,"Scientists in Germany have conducted a life-cycle analysis of perovskite-silicon tandems to determine how this new technology could affect the sustainability of the energy supply and solar manufacturing itself.
The study focuses on materials and manufacturing processes provided by Oxford PV, which is currently ramping up commercial production of perovskite-silicon modules in Germany. It is the first to analyze the environmental impacts of perovskite technology based on actual industrial production data.
Tandem cell manufacturing starts with the processing of silicon solar cells, and then adds a second active cell layer on top. So naturally, with more manufacturing involved, the impact increases. However, the scientists found that the additional energy required to manufacture a tandem module could be more than offset by the extra energy it will produce over its lifetime.
“We found that the perovskite-on-silicon module has 6% to 18% less environmental impact than a silicon module, when we consider the additional energy generated over the tandem module’s 25-year lifetime,” said Martin Roffeis, co-author from Technische Universität Berlin.
The gap will presumably get larger as the technology improves, as another group of researchers recently passed the 30% efficiency mark with a tandem cell. The full analysis can be found in “New insights into the environmental performance of perovskite-on-silicon tandem solar cells – a life cycle assessment of industrially manufactured modules,” which was recently published in Sustainable Energy & Fuels.
The group found that the impacts of the tandem modules were up to 7% higher in the categories of global warming potential, terrestrial ecotoxicity, freshwater consumption, fossil fuel depletion, and metal depletion. The tandem module in the study was shown to generate the same amount of electricity in 22 years as reference silicon heterojunction module over 25 years, which was enough to offset these extra impacts. While the addition of perovskite to the module was shown to increase its environmental impacts, the study also showed that the largest part of these impacts came from the manufacture of the silicon wafer – this stage showed the largest impact in global warming potential, freshwater consumption, and fossil fuel depletion.
In the remaining categories of ecotoxicity and metal depletion, the production of copper cabling, aluminum module frames, and float glass were shown to be the largest contributors. The researchers said that the use of lead in the perovskite layer, which is controversial to some due its toxicity, actually had very little impact on the ecotoxicity score.
“The sustainability of solar materials and supply chains is growing in importance as the world deploys solar at the multi-terawatt level,” says Laura Miranda Pérez, head of materials research at Oxford PV.
“We hope our contribution will help industry and the wider scientific community to improve the design, production, and end-of-life management of tandem technologies, supporting their rollout,” she added.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/11/the-stabilizing-effect-of-vertical-east-west-oriented-pv-systems/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 11, 2022",The stabilizing effect of vertical east-west oriented PV systems,"Scientists from the Leipzig University of Applied Sciences have looked at the potential impact of deploying vertical west-east oriented PV systems on a massive scale in the German energy market. They have found that such installations could have a beneficial effect in stabilizing the country's grid, while allowing greater integration with agricultural activities than with conventional ground-mounted PV plants.
The researchers used the EnergyPLAN model developed by Aalborg University in Denmark. It is commonly used to simulate the operation of national energy systems on an hourly basis, including the electricity, heating, cooling, industry, and transport sectors. It helps to predict how the German energy system might look like with more vertical PV by 2030.
“Only two parameters are systematically varied: firstly, the share of installed power of the different PV variants,” the academics said, noting that they did not consider solar trackers. “Secondly, two scenarios are considered, in which either a large-scale electricity storage is integrated or not.”
For conventional ground-mounted systems, the scientists considered a tilt angle of 20 degrees and an average estimated energy yield 1,020 Wh/W. For the bifacial vertical west-east oriented systems, they assumed a bifaciality factor of 90% and an annual energy yield of 999 Wh/W, while for vertical systems with a north-south orientation the annual energy yield was indicated at 926 Wh/W.
“In our model electricity demand for 2030 increases to 1,214 TWh/a and depends mainly on the assumptions for energy saving and fuel switch,” they said. “The greatest uncertainties are in the heat supply for buildings and industry.”
They also took into account the higher costs of bifacial panels, as well as that the installable power per area of vertical installation is lower due to shading effects, as the module row distance usually ranges from 8 meters to 12 meters, which in turn increases wiring costs.
“The additional cost for the land itself must be shared with the retained agricultural land use or benefit due to biodiversity promotion,” they said.
The scientists found that vertical PV systems can shift solar yield into hours of higher electricity demand and more electricity supply in the winter months, thus reducing solar curtailment.
“If electricity storage of 1 TW charging and discharging power and 1  TWh capacity is integrated into the energy system model, the effect is reduced to CO2 savings of up to 2.1 Mt/a with 70% vertical east-west and 30% inclined south facing modules,” they said. “Finally, while it might seem unrealistic for some to achieve a rate of 70% vertical power plants, even a lower rate has a beneficial impact.”
They described their findings in “Integration of vertical solar power plants into a future German energy system, published in Smart Energy. “The intention of this paper is by no means suggesting for all utility PV systems being vertically mounted in future,” they concluded. “Much rather a new opportunity is highlighted. Vertical PV systems can support the overall energy system.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/07/11/a-single-solar-panel-can-offset-the-carbon-emissions-of-10-trees/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JULY 11, 2022",A single solar panel can offset the carbon emissions of 10 trees,"From pv magazine USA
Is it okay to cut down a tree in order to install solar panels? This complex question must consider emissions, as well as the continuity and value of nature.
An analysis by the European Environmental Commission suggests that a single tree will sequester 22 kg (48.5 lbs) of carbon per year in its physical structure, until the 3 trillion trees die and release themselves as methane. Each acre of mature forest is inhabited by 100 to 400 trees, sequestering 4,850 to 19,400 pounds of carbon per acre each year.
 
Keep in mind, those carbon sequestration rates only apply to full-bodied, mature trees. Brush trees and saplings capture only a fraction of the volume of carbon of large mature trees, which is an important factor to consider when deciding whether or not to fell trees.
When we look at the emissions offsets produced by solar installations, the numbers depend on differences in how each region’s electricity is generated, as well as the time of day that region’s electricity is generated. The hydroelectric power that supplies the majority of upstate New York’s electricity is considerably cleaner than the coal plants that supply roughly half of the electricity to Nebraska, and therefore solar installations in Nebraska offset many times more emissions than equivalent installations located in upstate New York.
 
According to the US Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration, the nation averaged 0.85 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt-hour generated. Thus, an average 400 W solar panel generating 1.5 kWh per watt per year* will offset 510 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions.
*Solar panel output varies greatly by geographic region – panels installed in the south generate more electricity than those in the North.
A single solar panel offsets a carbon emissions equivalent exceeding that of ten mature trees. The average residential solar installation, roughly 7,000 watts, offsets the emissions equivalent of more than 180 trees. A single acre of solar panels with a capacity of 250,000 watts can be expected to offset more carbon emissions than 6,500 trees.
So if the argument were purely based on emissions, a single residential solar installation is already worth more than a few trees. And a single acre of densely populated solar panels offsets at least 16 to 65 times more emissions than a forest of the same size.
Another encouraging fact is that the solar emissions offset value isn’t the final word on a facility’s offset emissions. Solar power facilities that are installed on top of well managed, carbon sequestering land may end up producing additional carbon offsets.
 
For instance, analysis suggests that an acre of grazed native plants underneath the solar facility may improve soil at a rate of 1 ton of sequestered carbon per year, and that carbon and other nutrients may accumulate for 12 to 15 years before the soil is fully saturated.
Researchers who modeled prairie grasses in the upper midwest United States, see that that native grasses planted as part of 10 GW of solar generation capacity would sequester 129.3 tons of carbon per hectare; that is 65% and 35% greater than either an agriculture or a solar-turfgrass scenario, respectively.
So while it is true that we need large swatches of interconnected, undisturbed nature to have a healthy environment that supports human life over the coming millennium, it is also true that cutting down some trees, in specific situations, provides a net benefit from an emissions reduction perspective.
