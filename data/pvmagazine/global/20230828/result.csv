(KEPCO) and Jeonnam Development Corp. to build a data center complex in Haenam, in South Jeolla province. The complex will mainly draw its electricity from PV.
Involvement in the initiative extends to multiple regional authorities and companies, including Samsung C&T, LG CNS, NH Investment & Securities, Bosung Industry, TGK, Korea DRD, and Deus Systems.
The complex is set to host 25 data centers, each with a 40 MW capacity. The construction process will occur in phases, with completion of at least five data centers expected by 2027.
The project will require a total investment of KRW 10 trillion ($7.53 billion). However, MOTIE has not disclosed specific details about the solar aspect of the project, or whether it will be given public support.
South Korea now has other gigawatt-scale solar initiatives in progress.
In December, a consortium led by Hanwha Asset Management revealed intentions to establish a 1.5 GW, KRW 3 trillion solar project on industrial complex rooftops and idle land plots in Daegu. South Korea has also announced a 2.1 GW floating solar project and a 3 GW ground-mounted PV array in the Saemangeum area.
The country's largest solar plant, currently a 150 MW solar park in Sinan county, South Jeolla province, was developed by South-East Power. South Jeolla province also hosts the highest number of renewable energy projects under development in South Korea.

The main goal of their work was to assess the absorber tube costs, working fluid choices, and Nano-PCM utilization, in an effort to investigate the economic viability of the system.
“The economic practicality of PVT collectors hinges on their ability to capture solar energy while remaining cost-effective and efficient,” the research’s corresponding author, Adnan Ibrahim, told pv magazine. “In our investigation, we thoroughly analyze PVT collectors' Annual Cost (AC) and Annual Energy Gain (AEG), using the AC/AEG ratio as a key cost-benefit indicator.”
PCMs are materials that can absorb, store, and release large amounts of latent heat over defined temperature ranges. They have often been used at the research level for PV module cooling and the storage of heat.
To create the Nano-PCM, the scientists combined a nanofluid based on silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles with water and paraffin. “The volume fractions of nanofluids were 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively, and the nano-PCM had a volume fraction of 1%,” they said, noting that SiC offers high heat conductivity, low cost, and stability.
The PVT system consists of a 30 W photovoltaic module with a size of 64 cm x 30 cm, absorber tubes attached to the back of the panel via enhanced silicone glue bond, and a nano-PCM container surrounding the tubes. The setup also includes a fluid tank, heat exchanger, pumps, and a cooling unit.
The group tested the systems with different absorbers and working fluid configurations at a room temperature of 25 C, a working fluid temperature of 20 C and a solar irradiance level of 800 W/m2. It found that the panel has a surface temperature of 77.59 C, a PV efficiency of about 7%, and mass flow rates ranging from 0.008 to 0.04 kg/s.
“The thermal efficiency increased by 12% when the flow rate increased from 0.008 to 0.04 kg/s using the circular tube and by about 13.5% with the twisted tube,” the academics said. “This improvement was attributed to the increased convection heat transfer coefficient, resulting in a higher heat transfer rate between the PV panel and the absorber tubes.”
They also ascertained that using the twisted tube significantly reduced the temperature of the PV unit and that the prototype with a 0.6% concentration of SiC achieved thermal and photovoltaic efficiencies of 84.74% and 9.61%, respectively. “Its electrical output was 16 W, compared to 10.49 W for the bare PV panel,” they added.
“Our primary focus is optimizing the utilization of thermal and electrical energy from solar sources,” Ibrahim explained. “Interestingly, a standard PV panel's AC/AEG ratio was $0.0982/kWh. However, the most promising results were observed with a configuration incorporating nanofluids, twisted absorber tubes, and nano-PCM, achieving an impressive AC/AEG ratio of $0.0485/kWh.”
“Our research sheds valuable light on the potential of PVT systems, underscoring their role as a compelling avenue for sustainable energy solutions,” he emphasized.
The scientists introduced the system in the paper “Nanofluid-based photovoltaic thermal solar collector with nanoparticle-enhanced phase change material (Nano-PCM) and twisted absorber tubes,” published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering.
“Further investigation opportunities for this field include utilizing twisted tape in twisted absorber tubes with PVT to enhance performance, exploring enhanced convection heat transfer coefficients, and investigating the application of twisted tubes in other absorber tube designs for potentially improved results,” they said, referring to the future directions their research should take.
Other research groups at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia recently designed a bifacial photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) panel that utilizes circular jets impinging as a cooling medium, a photovoltaic-thermal system based on PCM cooling, multi-level fin heat sinks for solar module cooling, and passive technology for solar module cooling based on fin heat sinks.

A team of researchers at Western Australia’s Edith Cowan University have redesigned zinc-air batteries and claim to have overcome the technology’s notorious power output limitations.
“The new design has been so efficient it suppressed the internal resistance of batteries, and their voltage was close to the theoretical voltage which resulted in a high peak power density and ultra-long stability,” said research lead Muhammad Rizwan Azhar.
Zinc-air batteries consist of a zinc negative electrode and an air positive electrode. The chemistry holds promise and is significantly more sustainable than lithium-based counterparts, but the poor performance of air electrodes and short lifespan has limited the technology’s power output and ultimately its reach.
However, the Edith Cowan University team, says it has made a breakthrough in the technology which has enabled engineers to use a combination of new materials, such as carbon, cheaper iron and cobalt based minerals, to overcome these issues. The redesigned zinc-air batteries have emerged as a better alternative to lithium, according to the team’s recent study.
“Rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) are becoming more appealing because of their low cost, environmental friendliness, high theoretical energy density, and inherent safety,” said Azhar.
Lithium batteries rely on high-cost, finite resources, and also have safety issues.
In the latest, “In Conversation” issue of pv magazine we talk to a range of people about their experience with solar, from a sailor and a pair of overland adventurers to a mountain climber and more besides. We also focus on Africa to consider why a continent with such vast solar resource still lags more developed economies when it comes to widespread PV and energy storage rollout.
”With the emergence of next-generation long-range vehicles and electric aircraft in the market, there is an increasing need for safer, more cost-effective, and high-performance battery systems that can surpass the capabilities of lithium-ion batteries,” said Azhar. “By using natural resources, such as zinc from Australia and air, this further enhances the cost-effectiveness and viability of these innovative zinc-air batteries for the future.”

India added approximately 6.8 GW of new solar capacity during the first half of 2023, including 4.2 GW of utility-scale projects, 2.3 GW of rooftop installations, and 0.3 GW of offgrid systems. This marked a decrease of about 15% compared to solar installations in the first half of 2022, according to a recent report by JMK Research & Analytics.
In the second quarter of 2023 (April-June period), around 1.7 GW of utility-scale solar capacity was installed, up 28% from the preceding quarter.
India's cumulative installed renewable capacity reached 129.6 GW as of June 30, 2023. Among renewable sources, solar maintained its dominance, contributing 54% to the total mix, followed by wind at 34%.
A promising pipeline of approximately 66 GW for solar, wind, and hybrid projects is expected to be commissioned within the next four to five years. Additionally, 61.9 GW of projects are in the bidding phase, where tenders have been issued but auctions are yet to be finalized.
Analysts at JMK Research said that India will add around 13 GW of new solar capacity (9 GW of utility-scale solar and 4 GW of rooftop PV) and 4.1 GW of wind capacity in calendar year 2023. Furthermore, approximately 5.8 GW of solar and 2.3 GW of wind capacity are expected to be added in the upcoming two quarters.
In the second quarter of 2023, Sineng led in terms of inverter shipments, followed by Sungrow and Fimer, while Waaree emerged as the leading module supplier, accounting for approximately 14.2% of the total shipments
Adani emerged as a major player in both the utility-scale solar and wind segments, boasting an operational capacity of approximately 8.3 GW and a robust pipeline of 20.4 GW.
In the Indian market, the price of Chinese mono PERC modules (excluding goods and services tax and basic customs duty) stood at $0.27/Wp to $0.29/Wp during the second quarter of 2023, down 9% to 13% from the previous quarter. Bifacial module prices ranged between $0.30/Wp to $0.32/Wp.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/28/energy-management-system-to-combine-residential-pv-with-gravity-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MOROCCO",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 28, 2023",Energy management system to combine residential PV with gravity storage,"A group of researchers from the International University of Rabat in Morocco has developed a smart house energy management system (SHEMS) to optimize electricity production in residential PV systems combined with gravity energy storage (GES).
“The SHEMS supports two-way communication between smart home users and grid utilities,” the research’s corresponding author, Asmae Berrada, told pv magazine. “SHEMS is flexible in managing and controlling smart home appliances, renewable energy resources, and energy storage systems in order to participate in electricity conservation and demand response.”
In the paper “Intelligent Energy Management System for Smart Home with Grid-Connected Hybrid Photovoltaic/Gravity Energy Storage System,” published in the Journal of Energy Storage, Berrada and her colleagues explained that the proposed system is based on a novel one-week dynamic forecasting model that considers PV power generation, the state of charge of the GES system, the electricity price, and the scheduled load on the horizon for one week.
“In addition, it enables the user to perform intelligent household energy allocation, optimize household load allocation in the time dimension, achieve customer demand response, relieve grid pressure during peak hours, and improve grid stability,” they stated, adding that the system’s hardware consists of a SHEMS center, smart meters, communication and networking systems, and other unspecified smart devices that connect all home appliances.
The SHEMS usually uses PV power generation from the solar array to power the house’s loads. When excess electricity is produced, the system uses it to energize the GES system or injects it into the grid. When PV power is insufficient to meet all the household’s electricity needs, the GES system is activated by the SHEMS. “In situations where neither the PV power nor the GES power is sufficient to cover the entire energy demand of the loads, the system draws power from the electrical grid,” the Moroccan group said. “The grid acts as a backup source of electricity to ensure that all the loads in the house receive the required power.”
The researchers validated their model through a case study considering a household with a maximum power consumption of 6 kW, a 5 kW PV system, and a 0.5 kWh GES system with a water tank volume of 28.63 m3. The house is assumed to also use heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and to host EV recharging, with the EV battery being programmed to charge during the period between 1 am and 5 am.
“This time window takes advantage of the low energy prices and ensures that the vehicle is fully charged by the morning,” the research team explained. “Other loads are scheduled to operate when there is available PV production, except for the refrigerator, lighting, TV, computer, and fans. However, a portion of the energy consumption for these appliances can be supplied by the energy storage system (GES).”
Through their modeling, the academics found that the PV-GES unit can cover the household’s power demand for approximately 8 h each day, with discharging of the GES system occurring usually between 4 pm and 5 pm. “This leads to significant reductions in the house’s energy costs and its adverse environmental footprint,” it emphasized.

Shipbuilder Incat Tasmania has commenced construction of a lightweight aluminum ferry that it said will be the largest 100% battery-electric vessel yet built. The 40 MWh battery energy storage system is expected to be the largest installed on a ship – four times bigger than the current largest installation.
The catamaran, designed to carry both passengers and freight, is being built for South American customer Buquebus and will operate between Argentina and Uruguay. The vessel will be capable of carrying up to 2,100 passengers and 225 cars at up to 25 knots.
Incat Managing Director Craig Clifford said the vessel will be driven by two electric drives mounted in pods beneath the hull with the batteries to power a series of electric motors that will drive “an extremely efficient, completely integrated” propulsion and water jet package.
“This ship will have leading edge technology in terms of zero emissions propulsion and storage systems,” he said. “Once in operation the shore-side charging systems will have 50% more capacity than any current installation world-wide.”
Wartsila has been nominated to provide the electric propulsion and waterjet system that will power the vessel. The Finnish company will also provide the energy management, power conversion and DC shore-charging systems for the project.
Wartsila has selected Norwegian maritime energy storage systems specialist Corvus Energy to supply the battery systems.
Corvus Commercial Director Europe Halvard Hauso said with more than 40 MWh of energy storage, the battery modules and energy storage system package is four times larger than on any electric or hybrid ship currently operating.
“This vessel will be the largest of its type with the highest ESS capacity and it will also have the longest zero-emission journey, at the highest speed, and it will be charged with the world’s highest capacity chargers,” he said.
The battery systems are scheduled for delivery in the latter part of 2024 with the vessel to be delivered in 2025.
Clifford said the build has attracted global attention and that the interest is expected to magnify as the maritime industry’s decarbonization journey gathers momentum.
“The feedback from overseas has been extraordinarily positive,” he said. “I expect that we are going to see many more battery electric ships built.”
Incat said it has already started working toward the construction of a second but smaller battery-electric vehicle and passenger ferry.

Global additions of renewable power capacity are expected to jump by about one-third this year, says the International Energy Agency (IEA). This is due to a combination of factors, including the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the war in Ukraine, and the technology adoption cost curve. However, we’ve only just begun to tap solar’s immense potential.
According to Jim Tyler, CEO of solar technology company Erthos, reducing the cost of solar electricity will be key to unlocking the next chapter of the energy transition: a green hydrogen economy. In a recent interview, Tyler explained how driving down solar’s levelized cost of energy (LCOE) can accelerate the adoption of solar for green hydrogen production. While the startling drop in solar panel prices – from $5/W in 2005 to around $0.25/W today – has driven the industry’s growth, ongoing LCOE reductions remain imperative.
“You have to get to below $20/MWh,” said Tyler of the solar electricity price needed to produce competitive green hydrogen. “There are ways to do that. There are ways to get to below $20.”
The 2023 LCOE report by Lazard put solar on parity with wind at $24/MWh.
Erthos, which was founded by Tyler in 2019, slashes costs through a novel “solar skin” design that eliminates racking and piles by placing panels directly on the ground. The technology is being embraced by developers like Industrial Sun, which announced a 100 MW solar project using Erthos technology in December 2022. This approach reduces steel usage by 35 tons per megawatt, halves installation time and real estate needs, and lowers O&M costs. The carbon footprint of steel manufacture is 1.4 tons to  1.65 tons of CO2e/ton of steel.
The flat to ground solar also reduces mechanical stress and microcracking on panels, boosting energy yield and project return on investment, according to a white paper by Erthos. What about periodic flooding of the solar array that flat mounted solar might encounter in the field, you ask? Tyler, who served as VP of EPC for First Solar in the past, points to the intrinsic waterproof design of both solar panels and balance of system that can withstand periodic flooding.
By streamlining the system, Erthos delivers an estimated 20% lower LCOE compared to single axis tracker based solar construction. While industry observers initially doubted putting panels on the ground, Erthos has now contracted over 200 MW of its revolutionary design.
“It’s just a matter of time until all module providers recognize that and ultimately sign up to this technology,” said Tyler, noting that nine leading module manufacturers have already partnered with Erthos.
Others are pushing LCOE lower in different ways, like tracker manufacturer Nextracker introducing systems with fewer parts. But why does shaving cents off the cost of solar matter so much? Because it can make the difference in scaling up green hydrogen to displace fossil fuels.
“I’m a very firm believer that we are not going to electrify our way out of the [climate] problem,” said Tyler. “We have to solve the problem another way. We have to find a renewable replacement for fossil fuel.”
That replacement is hydrogen. Clean hydrogen produced by splitting water with renewable electricity offers a sustainable fuel for transportation, industry, and more. But historically high production costs have limited adoption.
