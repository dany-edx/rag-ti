(CNPC) has transported hydrogen by blending it into a gas pipeline in Ningxia, China. “After 100 days of test operation, the overall operation of this 397-kilometer natural gas pipeline is safe and stable,” said the Chinese company. The proportion of hydrogen in this natural gas pipeline has gradually reached 24%. The country is working to achieve a 20% blending throughout its entire 185,000-kilometer gas network. Blending hydrogen into natural gas networks would reportedly decrease dramatically the cost of hydrogen transportation. “The cost of hydrogen transmission is about 10% of a gas tank trailer,” said the company. 
China has announced plans to build a 400-kilometer hydrogen pipeline to bring hydrogen from the resource-rich west to energy-consuming regions in the east. The Xinhua news agency reported that the pipeline will transport 100,000 tons of the energy carrier, with the potential to increase the capacity by 500,000 tons. Hydrogen will be transported from Ulanqab, in China's Inner Mongolia region, to Beijing. According to the article, Ma Yongsheng, the chairman of Sinopec, said it will be the country’s first trans-regional, long-distance hydrogen pipeline. In February, Sinopec launched its first hydrogen demonstration project in the Inner Mongolia region.
The European Clean Hydrogen Alliance has published a report on the potential development of six hydrogen import corridors in Europe. The South Central corridor would bring hydrogen from North Africa to Europe through Italy. The Iberian corridor would connect Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and Algeria to France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany. The North Sea corridor would include liquid hydrogen import facilities and an offshore pipeline from Norway to Germany. The Nordic Baltic corridor would bring hydrogen from Scandinavia through the Baltic countries, Poland and Germany. The Eastern corridor would bring hydrogen from Ukraine through Slovakia and Hungary. The Southeastern corridor could also “facilitate hydrogen imports from the neighboring countries via shipping or subsea pipeline transportation.” All of the corridors would include new transmission lines, the conversion of existing infrastructure, and storage facilities.
The Port of Rotterdam is developing an 11-hectare site for a green hydrogen plant powered by wind energy, with a capacity of up to 1 GW. “The wind farm and hydrogen plant should be ready around 2028,” said the port operator. The Dutch Minister for Climate and Energy announced the draft ministerial regulations for IJmuiden Ver Wind Farm Zone Beta. The formal tender process will start in the second half of 2023.
Iowa, Nebraska, and Missouri have submitted grant applications with the US Department of Energy for funding to establish the Mid-Continent Clean Hydrogen Hub (MCH2) in the tri-state region. “Together we have an opportunity to open new markets for agriculture while strengthening our commitment to American-made renewable energy,” said Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds. 
Matrix Renewables and Rolwind Renovables hacve announced the expansion of their partnership through the creation of HYREN, a new platform dedicated to the development and creation of the green hydrogen economy in Spain. “HYREN brings together the projects initiated by both companies and begins its journey with a portfolio of national projects, which will total a generation capacity of more than 1 GW in Andalusia, Aragon, and Castilla La Mancha, with a target of achieving up to 4 GW,” said Matrix Renewables.
First Hydrogen has released its vision for a zero-emission Recreational Vehicle (RV). “The RV concept illustrates how First Hydrogen is exploring how fuel cell electric technology could be applied to larger vehicles,” said the Canadian company.

The Italian Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security has unveiled a new incentive scheme to support innovative agrivoltaic solutions. The Italian government has submitted the new provisions to the European Commission and will now have to wait for its approval.
The scheme is part of the country's National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR) and has a budget of €1.1 billion, which should be enough to deploy around 1.04 GW of PV capacity by June 2026.
Only agrivoltaic projects with vertical mounting structures or high-efficiency innovative PV modules will be able to participate in the scheme. The selected developers will be awarded rebates for up to 40% of the initial costs of buying and installing PV systems. They will be granted feed-in tariffs for the energy they inject into the grid.
The new decree also defines “advanced agrovoltaic systems.” They must include innovative mounting solutions that place solar modules above the ground, without compromising the continuity of agricultural operations. In general, the new provisions define “advanced agrovoltaic systems” as complex systems that enhance productive potential, while ensuring the continuity of agricultural activities.

ONGC, India’s largest crude oil and natural gas company, aims to reach 10 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 with a capital expenditure of $12.18 billion. It had 348 MW of installed renewables capacity as of May 30, 2022, and is targeting 5 GW by 2025. 
The company said it sees favorable government policies and viability gap funding for offshore wind as key enablers of the energy transition. It has already signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of the Indian state of Rajasthan to set up 5 GW of renewable energy projects. To achieve its goal, ONGC has partnered with Norway’s Equinor and Indian developer Greenko. 
Under the agreement with Equinor, the two sides will collaborate on renewables, low-carbon fuel, carbon capture storage (CCS), and carbon capture utilization and sequestration (CCUS) opportunities in India. ONGC and Greenko, meanwhile, plan to jointly explore opportunities in renewables, green hydrogen, and its derivatives, including green ammonia.

In some parts of Africa, up to 30% of agricultural or marine products, such as vegetables and fish, spoil on their way to market due to a lack of refrigeration or preservation facilities. This is due, to a large extent, to the lack of proper electrical infrastructure in rural areas.
With its SolCoolDry cooperative project, Fraunhofer ISE has developed a facility for solar-assisted ice production and the solar drying of foodstuffs, in cooperation with German company Innotech Ingenieursgesellschaft mbH. In the project, funded by the German Federal Agency for Agriculture and Food, Fraunhofer ISE cooperated with state research body the Kenya Industrial Research and Development Institute (KIRDI), the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, and the Technical University of Mombasa.
The project objective was to provide help to local people and to develop a system that they can operate on their own. Since February 2023, the system has been jointly run by KIRDI and the Beach Management Unit, an association of local fisher folk, mangrove planters, agricultural and seaweed farmers, and beekeepers.
The core of the SolCoolDry system consists of a 15 kWp rooftop photovoltaic system and a 19.2 kWh lithium nickel, manganese, cobalt (NMC) battery. Three PV inverters feed the electricity from the rooftop into a three-phase grid, generated by standalone battery inverters. The inverters also recharge the battery with excess solar power, when needed.
The flake ice machine and the ice storage room is powered by the minigrid. As the ice machine runs on solar energy alone, during the daytime, 550 kg of ice can be produced. In order to be able to use the groundwater available on site, and thus become independent of external water delivery, a water treatment system is currently being built.
The SolCoolDry system also has two solar tunnel dryers in which air is heated and distributed over the dry goods by fans throughout the day. In order to be able to continue drying throughout the night, one of the tunnel dryers contains heating pipes. These are supplied with heat from a 12 m2 flat-plate thermal collector and a 2,000 liter hot water storage tank.
The severe travel restrictions imposed during the height of the Covid pandemic posed a challenge for Fraunhofer’s German and Kenyan project team, rendering it impossible for the German partners to set up the system on-site. As a result, Fraunhofer ISE created a video tutorial instead, which enabled the project’s Kenyan partners to set up the system largely on their own; an interesting learning process for both sides.
After electrical commissioning by Fraunhofer, the system was officially handed over to the local partners. A technician, who is currently being trained, will ensure stable operation of the project in the future. User fees for the dryer plus revenue from the sale of the ice will finance the plant’s maintenance in order to ensure the sustainability of the project. Fraunhofer ISE will also continue to monitor the performance of the plant. The data generated will be recorded in a monitoring system so that remote diagnosis is possible. This aspect is essential for the further support of the local partners in cases of maintenance and repair.
By cooling and drying fish and meat, as well as vegetables, fruit, and other products, farmers and fisher folk are now able to avoid spoilage and bring more products to the market. The first weeks of trial operation proved that there is great interest in the functioning plant.
The SolCoolDry plant has been very well received by the local population and the demand for ice is even greater than originally anticipated. Some fisher folk drive up to 50 km to pick up the ice. Like the ice machine, the drying plant also operates continuously and is used to dry meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, and flowers for making tea. The preservation of foodstuffs enables farmers and fishers to sell their products out of season, thus creating a more secure income base and generating higher revenue. In further courses, the fishers will be trained in quality assurance and the hygienic processing of their products.
The SolCoolDry system is a “lighthouse” project. There are very few autonomous solar systems of this kind in Kenya thus far. Therefore, the interest in the technology is high and the goal is to learn from the operation of the system and to be able to make recommendations for future installations.

The researchers described their findings in “Integrated techno-economic and life cycle assessment of shared circular business model based blockchain-enabled dynamic grapevoltaic farm for major grape growing states in India,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy. They said the new system design facilitates rainwater harvesting, with the solar array tilting to follow the direction of the rain. The system then stores and reuses the collected water for irrigation purposes.
The researchers used a circular business model (CBM) based on blockchain and smart contract technologies to coordinate between PV system operators and grape farmers.
“The proposed system will work even without blockchain configuration,” researcher Nallapaneni Manoj Kumar told pv magazine. “But with blockchain configuration, agrivoltaics work more efficiently with perfect co-ordination considering all the uncertainties that arise between the solar power generation and grape farming in terms of co-location shareable uses such as water for crop irrigation and solar panel washing. This is only possible when the system is able to track real-time weather and operate automatically via smart contracts.”
The academics used a resilience performance, life cycle analysis, and techno-economic (RePLiCATE) approach to demonstrate the multifunctional viability of the system across several grape-producing states in India. They claimed that the country's current regulations for power purchase agreements (PPAs) are not making agrivoltaics viable.
“Smart contracts help in automating the agreements and provide a link to the energy and grape trading marketplace,” they said.
For its 1-ha “grapevoltaic” farm model, the research team considered vine–yard planning, solar PV configurations for vineyards, crop water requirements considering evapotranspiration, rainwater water harvesting potential, and energy requirements for groundwater extraction. The modeling involved  1,458 growing plants in 27 rows and a 504 kW PV installation arranged in 14 rows. The system featured panels with outputs of 100 W each and dimensions of 1,197 mm × 535 mm There was spacing 0.13 meters of spacing between the modules.
The panels have a surface that allows the free flow of water. The water can be used to clean the panels themselves or provide irrigation via a drip system connected to a storage tank.
The scientists said that the total revenue generated by a 1-ha Grapevoltaic farm could vary, depending on electricity and grape yield productions, electricity prices, and grape market prices. They said the proposed system can reduce water consumption for farmers and PV operators. 
“Agrivoltaics, in general, are a good solution for grape production as grape plant is shade tolerant but is also more sensitive to weather events,” Nallapaneni said. “To avoid these we need such high technical systems that can link, for example, the grape farm to GrapeNet platform where trade regulations and grape certifications can be done in one click.”

An EAHE is a passive geothermic solution consisting of a buried pipe system circulating fresh air. These systems are commonly used to warm up fresh air in buildings in the winter and to cool it down in the summer.
“To put it simply, EAHE is based on the concept of utilizing temperatures below 2-3 m from the earth's surface that remains consistent throughout the year irrespective of ambient air temperature variations,” researcher Basudev Pradhan told pv magazine. “The temperature beneath the earth's surface is cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter than the air above. So, the designed system will blow ambient air through a pipe installed at a certain depth from the surface, and the air will get warmer or cooler in winter or summer due to heat exchange with the surrounding soil.”
The scientists designed the proposed PV-powered EAHE with a statistical tool response surface approach, using calculation and modeling software.  The EAHE is designed to have PVC pipes tilted by a small angle to prevent condensed water from standing inside and to be buried horizontally. The solar array consists of PV panels, charge controllers, an inverter, and a battery.
The researchers assumed the EAHE was to be operated for 24 hours in all months except for July and August. They said the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) is estimated to be 7.34 for cooling and 8.99 for heating. They also calculated that the  yearly heating and cooling potential of the system is 4158 kWh/year and 3958.7 kWh/year, respectively.
“So, it can be concluded from the revealed information that in winter, the designed EAHE system works more effectively than in the summer season,” they explained.
They said the designed setup with optimized parameters results in an annual energy gain of 8116.7 kWh.
“If 24-hour grid electricity is available, a solar system has a straightforward payback period of four to five years,” the researchers said. “Moreover, this hybrid system has the potential to provide carbon credit of US$ 336.86 kWh/year. Thus, this system is an energy-saving and environment-friendly approach for both urban areas with 24 h grid availability as well as rural areas where grid extension is not possible or feasible due to some technical barriers.”
They presented the system in the paper “Numerical simulation of stand-alone photovoltaic integrated with earth to air heat exchanger for space heating/cooling of a residential building,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy.
“Such efficient, standalone, net zero systems can be further optimized for various location and climate conditions depending upon the variation in the atmospheric and earth parameters,” said Pradhan.

The 10th Basic Plan of Long-Term Electricity Supply and Demand, which was recently published by the South Korean government, reduces the 2030 renewable energy target from 30.2% to just 21.6%. The government has also announced plans to scale back its feed-in tariff policy and reduce the amount of renewable energy certificates (RECs) issued under the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) scheme for 2023 and onwards. These changes could reduce the size of the South Korean solar market from around 4.4 GW in 2021 and 2.7 GW in 2022 to a bit more than just 2 GW in 2023, according to several analysts.
However, event organizer Exco said the trade show has not suffered from these setbacks. It noted that 300 companies from 25 countries participated this year, with 32,800 visitors. “The 2022 edition hosted 21,124 visitors,” an Exco spokesperson told pv magazine, noting that the fair was also bigger in terms of total floor space, although it did not provide any specific figures.
Domestic industry
The event's success was partly ensured by the strength of the domestic module and inverter industry. The country is home to big players such as Qcells, Hyundai and OCI Solar, and all of them presented their latest products at the show.
 
Qcells, for example, has currently 4.5 GW of annual production capacity for both cells and panels at its South Korean facilities. “But we are planning to raise our cell capacity to 5.3 GW by the end of 2023,” a spokesperson told pv magazine.
Hyundai currently has 1.4 GW of module capacity and 1.1 GW of cells. “We are now almost ready to present our new heterojunction modules,” said company spokesperson.
OCI Solar presented two new inverters at the show. It said it plans to expand its overseas sales due to rising inverter demand.
Other South Korean module manufacturers at the trade show included Shinsung E&G Co. which operates an 800 MW module assembly facility. SDN, which currently operates two panel assembly factories, was also present at the show, as was Hansol, which owns a 500 MW module assembly facility.
In addition, inverter maker DASS Tech brought some of its devices to the trade show. It said that demand from outside South Korea is now on the rise. “We currently have an annual capacity of 600 MW, but we may raise it depending on future market conditions,” a spokesperson said.
The resilience of this domestic industry depends in part on recent carbon footprint rules. These are helping South Korean manufacturers because the country has extensive nuclear capacity. However, the rules do not completely exclude foreign manufacturers from entering the market.
“Despite the carbon footprint requirements, Korea remains an open market with a lot of opportunities,” said Cindy Hu, managing director of Yingli Solar. “However, we are considering identifying some local partners to qualify for these requirements, but it may take some time.”

In February, a balloon from China was shot down off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The balloon’s surveillance capabilities, outlined in a US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) document, were recently leaked on the Discord chat site by Jack Teixeira, a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard. Teixeira was charged on April 14 for unlawfully copying and transmitting classified materials.
The Washington Post reports that the leaked document confirmed that the balloon contained enough solar panels to power an advanced form of radar that can generate imagery at night. The surveillance system, known as synthetic aperture radar, can also pierce clouds and thin coverings such as tarps.
According to the NGA document, the vessel contained 10 kW of solar capacity. This is a similar to the amount of solar capacity one would find on a US residential rooftop array. The balloon also contained a parabolic dish measuring 1.2 meters in diameter, several unidentified sensors, and a possible mast antenna, said the newspaper.
The balloon was downed by a missile fired from a US Air Force jet on Feb. 4. China criticized the United States for its response to the balloon, saying that it is “irresponsible” and a demonstration of “information warfare” against Beijing.

Over the last eight months, since the passage of the IRA, more than $150 billion of domestic utility-scale clean power investments have been announced, according to the American Clean Power Association.
This unprecedented level of investment exceeds the total investment in utility-scale clean power projects brought online in the last five years combined, from 2017 to 2021. More than 96 GW of utility-scale projects have been announced over the eight-month stretch, said the American Clean Power Association.
Solar is set to play a central role in decarbonizing and onshoring US energy. By 2030, it is estimated that the IRA will drive the installation of 950 million solar panels, 120,000 wind turbines, and 2,300 grid-scale battery facilities. While the investments are a clear sign of the promising progress towards a decarbonized economy, the American Clean Power Association warns that more action needs to be taken to ensure that future.
“To realize this clean energy future and ensure the full potential of these projects, [the American Clean Power Association] urges the Administration and Congress to continue improving trade policies, supporting next-generation technologies, finalizing effective tax implementation and working to enact commonsense permitting reform,” it said in a new report.
The American Clean Power Association said that in the eight-month period, 46 utility-scale clean energy manufacturing facilities were announced, bringing an expected 18,000 or more US jobs.
It said 26 of the 46 announced facilities are solar manufacturing sites, 10 are utility-scale battery storage factories, and 10 are wind power factories – two of which are for offshore wind technology development. The report contains a full roundup of each of the manufacturing sites, the expected jobs created, the expected online date, investment data, and other relevant information.
The largest single-site announcement has been a Hanwha Qcells facility, which will involve an investment of $2.5 billion to expand the company’s manufacturing capacity in the United States. It is expected to create as many as 2,500 jobs in Georgia. The factory will cover several aspects of the solar supply chain, including polysilicon ingots, wafers, cells, and modules.
The latest issue of pv magazine takes a look at how the long-established link between solar and cannabis cultivation can help improve margins as medicinal and recreational use of the drug comes out of the weeds. We take a trip Down Under to examine why communities are rebelling against planned renewable energy zones perceived as being railroaded through without sufficient local consultation, and we consider the “solar crime” wave sweeping the UK and Europe.
One battery facility of note is American Battery Factory’s site to manufacture lithium-iron-phosphate battery cells for residential and commercial energy storage. The site, which is expected to go online in the fourth quarter of 2024, would bring $3.1 billion of economic activity in its local county in Arizona.

The system includes Growatt’s battery management system (BMS) technology, and it also features an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) function and multi-unit expansion.
Growatt says that it is taking pre-sale orders for its Infinity 1300 solar generator now through April 30 on its official website.
In December, Growatt announced a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery for residential and commercial rooftop PV applications. The APX HV battery has a storage capacity of 5 kWh with one battery module and up to 30 kWh with six modules. The system has a maximum parallel expansion to 60 kWh.
Last year, Growatt unveiled the Infinity 1500 solar generator, which has a battery capacity of 1,554 Wh and an AC output of 2,000 W. The manufacturer says it can power about 95% of outdoor and home appliances, with 12 outlets available for diverse needs. The device can be charged with up to four 24 V solar panels in series, or with 12 V solar panels.
