In September, the United States Department of Energy released the Solar Futures Study which outlines how solar energy could produce 45% of the nation’s electricity by 2050.
In order to reach this target, the U.S. would need to deploy 1,570 GW of solar by that date. The target also hinges on the existence of a concerted policy effort, aggressive cost-reductions, extensive deployment of other clean technologies, and expansions of the transmission system, as well as large-scale electrification of end uses.
Research and development is vital to maintaining or, ideally, accelerating solar photovoltaic technology cost-reduction trajectories for continued industry growth. There is a particular opportunity for the U.S. to establish itself as a global leader and achieve national decarbonization goals by supporting domestic manufacturing of next generation solar cell technologies.
For several years, crystalline silicon solar cells have dominated the market and have become the industry standard against which all alternatives are compared. In 2019, about 83% of the total PV market in the United States was crystalline silicon-based products. Under the umbrella of crystalline silicon cells, monocrystalline p-type passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC) undisputedly dominate the market.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/29/micro-inverters-vs-string-central-inverters/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,FRANCE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 29, 2021",Micro-inverters vs. string/central inverters,"A group of researchers from the University of Limoges has compared the performance ratio (PR) of PV systems equipped with micro-inverters to that of installations relying on central or string inverters at several locations across France. Surprisingly, the study finds that micro-inverters do not perform better.
The PR is a parameter that defines the relationship between the actual and expected power production of a PV system, and is largely unrelated to an installation’s location or orientation. This value is used to understand how efficiently the PV system is operating.
The researchers initially analyzed all advantages and disadvantages of an installation with micro-inverters or central/string inverters, and said that micro-inverters should offer an advantage on many points, including price. “We must also consider the lifespans of this equipment, which is a little less than 10 years for a central inverter and can reach 30 years for a micro-inverter,” they further explained. “Micro-inverters also appear to be better suited to reducing the impact of losses that can occur in solar panels whether due to shading or panel malfunction.”
These assumptions were evaluated by analyzing 200 PV installations located in France. The work considered their actual production of solar energy, as well as the orientation, the inclination, the peak power, the geographical area, and other factors. “In order to carry out a statistical study on the PR, 200 data sets were recovered: 100 for installations with Enphase M210, M215, M250 and IQ7 microinverters and 100 with installations using SMA SunnyBoy 3000, SunnyBoy 5000 inverters and Sunny Tripower STP 8000,” the academics explained. “Of the 100 systems, 50 are SunnyBoy 3000 (input power 3.2 kW), 25 are SunnyBoy 5000 (input power 5.2 kW) and 25 are Sunny Tripower STP 8000 (input power 8, 2 kW).”
The average capacity of the installations relying on micro-inverters was 3.8 kW and that of the second category was 5 kW.
The analysis showed that micro-inverters are more sensitive to environmental factors. Furthermore, the scientists found that the size of a PV system doesn't have an influence on the performance of either micro-inverters or inverters.
“According to the production data, the performance ratio is ultimately almost identical for installations with inverters or micro-inverters,” the French group emphasized. “The PR is around 79% for both the average facility equipped with micro-inverters and the average for other facilities.” It also reported slight growth in the PR with lower irradiance for both micro-inverter and central/string devices, which could depend on the inclination and orientation of the panels or the geographical area.
“Finally, the results show a homogeneity of the performance ratio between the two technologies despite different operations,” the academics concluded. “However, even if the performance ratio is identical between inverters and micro-inverters, micro-inverters are still to be favored because of their lifespans and their prices.” They go on to explain that microinverters may not be replaced for an entire 25 year module lifetime, and that they allow stakeholders to better guarantee the safety of the installation even in the event of fire.
Their findings were presented in the paper Performance ratio of photovoltaic installations in France Comparison between inverters and micro-inverters, which was recently published in the Journal of King Saud University – Engineering Sciences.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/29/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-defects-in-perovskite-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 29, 2021","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: defects in perovskite solar cells","Though scientists have been able to rapidly reach high solar cell efficiencies using perovskite materials, the specific mechanisms allowing for these is not fully understood, and research carried out to date shows that what is going on inside the material is quite to different to crystalline silicon and other common PV cell materials.
Since perovskite films are typically made up of more individual elements, they end up with a disordered structure and a range of different defects. Different elements of this structure have been shown to both help and hinder efficiency and stability in the solar cell, and understanding why this is could allow scientists to tailor materials to have more of the ‘good’ and less of the ‘bad’.
This was the aim of scientists led by the University of Cambridge in the UK, who used a range of different imaging techniques to gain a full picture of the perovskite at the nano-scale. “What we see is that we have two forms of disorder happening in parallel,” explains PhD student Kyle Frohna, “the electronic disorder associated with the defects that reduce performance, and then the spatial chemical disorder that seems to improve it.”
Using different techniques that focused individually on the chemical, structural and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite, including a trip to the UK’s diamond light source synchrotron facility, they were able to paint a fuller picture of the material’s behavior. “The idea is we do something called multimodal microscopy, which is a very fancy way of saying that we look at the same area of the sample with multiple different microscopes and basically try to correlate properties that we pull out of one with the properties we pull out of another one,” continued Frohna. “These experiments are time-consuming and resource-intensive, but the rewards you get in terms of the information you can pull out are excellent.”
Their findings are available in the paper Nanoscale chemical heterogeneity dominates the optoelectronic response of alloyed perovskite solar cells, published in Nature Nanotechnology. The results show that gradients in the structure push the charge into areas of the cell with fewer electronic disorders, and away from ‘traps’ that would reduce performance. “What we’ve found is that the chemical disorder – the ‘good’ disorder in this case – mitigates the ‘bad’ disorder from the defects by funneling the charge carriers away from these traps that they might otherwise get caught in,” said Frohna.
With this understanding, the group will be able to start working on ways to further mitigate the effects of one without also losing the positive effects. “Through these visualizations, we now much better understand the nanoscale landscape in these fascinating semiconductors – the good, the bad and the ugly,” said Cambridge University Assistant Professor in Energy Sam Stranks. “These results explain how the empirical optimization of these materials by the field has driven these mixed composition perovskites to such high performances. But it has also revealed blueprints for design of new semiconductors that may have similar attributes – where disorder can be exploited to tailor performance.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/29/italy-needs-own-supply-chain-to-navigate-raw-materials-crisis/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,ITALY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"NOVEMBER 29, 2021",‘Italy needs own supply chain to navigate raw materials crisis’,"Italian solar companies have asked the government to find a long-term solution to the current mismatch between supply and demand for solar modules and, to a lesser extent, for batteries.
Paolo Rocco Viscontini, president of trade association Italia Solare, has spoken to pv magazine about the vital role played by the national ‘super bonus‘ tax deduction in supporting Italian PV.
“Right now, incorrect management of the super-bonus would do great damage,” he said. “By improper management, I mean a stop. What will be next? We need to know soon and we need long-term planning. Let it be a gradual decrease; let it be linked to income levels, but let it continue.”
Pick up the latest edition of pv magazine to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyber attacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
The super bonus offers tax deductions worth 110% of the purchase price of systems including solar panels and home storage, with the deductions applied across subsequent tax years. PV arrays and batteries are eligible as long as they are part of more extensive projects which improve the energy efficiency of buildings.
The measure was introduced in May last year and has been extended throughout next year, for condominiums, and to June 30 for other buildings, with the chance to extend to the end of next year provided work has reached a sufficient stage by the end of June. Public housing renovation projects can claim the super bonus until June 30 2023, with an option to extend to the end of 2023.
Viscontini said he believes it will be impossible for Rome to further extend the super bonus at the 110% level and suggested a less generous scheme could provide support over a longer period and prove more sustainable for Italian solar. “The mechanism is working,” he said. “What we insist on is that there be a multi-year mechanism. And this is the only way for all operators to invest, to structure themselves, to hire. If there is a deadline after one year, it will just be all short-term work, without consequences on the job market.”
Demand for the super bonus has been such that residents have reported difficulty finding companies to carry out renovations, particularly for smaller projects in marginal parts of the country.
The Italia Solare president underlined the importance of regional planning, saying: “We need to hold regions accountable. We need to make subdivisions according to what has already been installed, the conformation of the territory, the need for energy flows in the networks … how many [solar systems are needed] on rooftops and how many on the ground? The emergency is real.”
While issuing faster permits at a regional level is a critical issue for Italian solar, Viscontini said the nation should be thinking about investing in more than just efficiency measures – it should consider PV manufacturing too.
“We need to think about an Italian industrial supply chain,” he said. “Why is there no serious project? The issue is that we don’t feel the emergency. We should have done investments over the last seven years. We slept. Now we have to go and get raw materials from someone. Buy Chinese companies. Buy raw materials, and do it today!”
And the trade body chief warned against being distracted by emerging low-emission energy technologies, such as modular nuclear reactors. “We have the solutions,” he said. “We need to be pragmatic. Let’s stop speaking about nuclear.”
With solar module prices having risen at least 30% in the last four months, Viscontini warned the situation could worsen as rampant demand for PV in China could soak up the output of raw materials supply as soon as new production capacity comes online.
“There is definitely a bottleneck for several materials,” said the Italia Solare president. “The most important material, the one that has had the most significant effect, is polysilicon. There is some new capacity coming online, large plants in China which we thought, until a few days ago, might be the solution to get back to lower prices. Then there was the statement from the Chinese government that they were going to [develop solar generation capacity] in the 100 GW range. Today total [solar] production is 200 GW per year. What the [Chinese solar] producers are telling me is: ‘Here, there will be such a strong domestic demand that we risk not being able to [return to] a normal situation even next year.'”
The situation in the world's biggest solar market is set to leave Italian developers even more dependent on the stock sitting in warehouses and, according to Viscontini, new megawatt scale solar projects are already facing delays until the spring for module delivery and “sometimes even those [projects] already agreed on will be delayed.”
On inverter supply, at least, Viscontini was more positive, even as demand for the devices – and for batteries – has risen on the back of the extended tax incentive. “With the super-bonus, 80-90% of inverters are made with batteries,” said the Italia Solare chief.
For batteries, though, the supply and pricing situation remains less clear because electric vehicle demand is accelerating. “So far, battery prices have been stable, but in the next few months you can expect at least a 20% increase,” said Viscontini.
With logistics costs, and in particular shipping charges, rising to punitive levels, solar price inflation appears inevitable.
“We have news on multiple fronts and they are converging,” added Viscontini. “A container a year ago was at $1,500 [€1,330], now it's traveling around $20,000 [€17,700], and that impacts modules and inverters.”

AGL has received approval from the Victorian Department of Environment, Water, Land and Planning for the development of the proposed 200 MW big battery, with four hours of storage, at the Loy Yang power station
AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said the approval will allow the energy giant to move forward with assessing the economics and viability of the project. “As the largest ASX operator of renewables assets, a key focus is to invest in storage and firming capacity to ensure we continue to provide reliable and affordable electricity to households and businesses,” he said.
The proposed Loy Yang big battery is part of AGL’s planned national roll-out of 850 MW of grid scale batteries with the gen-tailer confident its coal power generation sites can leverage off their existing access to the power grid, road, rail and water infrastructure.
pv magazine Australia will be examining the outlook for large scale solar Down Under in a webinar next week. The team, with our partner Risen Energy Australia, will kick things off at 7 a.m. (CET) on Wednesday, December 8 and you can sign up for the event here.
“Our generation sites provide rare and unique redevelopment opportunities as they are established sites with a surplus of land; road and rail access; transport facilities; and storage infrastructure embedded in the environment,” Brokhof said.
“As we continue on our pathway to net zero by 2050, we will progress our plans to develop these sites into integrated industrial energy hubs, with the Latrobe Hub set to create regional jobs and opportunities well into the future.”
Among AGL’s pipeline of grid scale batteries is the 250 MW/1,000 MWh battery being developed at the site of its gas-fired Torrens Island power station in South Australia. AGL has indicated construction of the battery will commence before the end of the year.
AGL has also received the tick of approval from the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) for a 50 MW/100 MWh battery in Broken Hill and is seeking planning approval for a 150 MW battery with one hour storage to be developed at the site of its Liddell Power Station in the Hunter Valley.
At Liddell, the coal-fired generator scheduled to close in April 2023, AGL has committed to a 150 MW battery but is seeking approval from the NSW government for a big battery of up to 500 MW and four hours' storage.
AGL already operates the 30 MW/8 MWh Dalrymple North battery in South Australia.
Should AGL reach a final investment decision on the Loy Yang grid scale battery, the project would be part of Accel Energy, following AGL’s proposed demerger.
The development approval for the Loy Yang grid scale battery follows the registration earlier last week of Neoen’s 300 MW/450 MWh Victoria Big Battery (VBB).
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) officially registered the VBB on Tuesday to deliver frequency control ancillary services (FCAS).
Under the System Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS) contract Neoen has signed with AEMO, the VBB will unlock up to an additional 250 MW of peak capacity on the existing Victoria to NSW interconnector.
The registration follows weeks of testing and commissioning, which was initially delayed after a fire in two of its Tesla Megapacks in late July set the process back by several months.
The VBB is the fourth big battery in operation in Victoria, with another at the Gannawarra solar farm (25 MW/30 MWh), one at a Ballarat (30 MW/30 MWh) and a fourth at the Bulgana wind farm (20 MW/34 MWh).
EnergyAustralia has also announced plans to develop a 350 MW/1,400 MWh big battery at the site of its Yallourn power station, before the closure of the coal-fired plant in mid-2028.
Melbourne-based renewables developer Syncline Energy has also revealed plans for a 600 MW/2,400 MWh battery storage project to be built 25 kilometers west of Melbourne.
The Melton Renewable Energy Hub has been fast tracked by the Victorian government under its planning scheme amendment, and Syncline hopes to reach financial close by the second quarter of 2022, with production to begin by the second half of 2023.

Conceived for applications in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), the solar cell was designed to be built with a 100μm-thick n-Si wafer and by punching, via photolithography, micro-holes that can allow light to be transmitted through the cell itself.
The holes are arranged in the shape of a periodic array within the device, which ensures, according to the research team, that the cell is highly flexible, with a bending radius of 6mm. “The periodic hole array structure uniformly distributes the stress across the device and suppresses the generation and propagation of microcracks,” they explained, noting that the structure was implemented by controlling the dry etching process.
In order to make the cell colorful, the scientists added organic dyes into its polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. PDMS is an organic-based polymer that is commonly used in solar module backsheets. After it was embedded in the cell, however, the bending radius decreased to 3mm.
The demonstrated device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 7.38% with an average visible light transmittance (AVT) of 45%, and an efficiency of 5.52% with an AVT of 60%. “The solar cells with PDMS encapsulation show high flexibility and long-term stability without significant degradation, even after cyclic bending deformations up to 1,000 cycles and 1,500 hours of the standard damp heat test,” the academics emphasized.
The solar cell is presented in the paper Colorful Transparent Silicon Photovoltaics with Unprecedented Flexibility, which was recently published in Advanced Functional Materials.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/11/29/phase-change-material-tech-to-store-thermal-energy-solar-electricity-in-buildings/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 29, 2021","Phase-change material tech to store thermal energy, solar electricity in buildings","A research group from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has developed a dynamically tunable phase-change material (PCM) that can be used to store both thermal energy and electricity if applied in buildings.
PCMs are substances that absorb and release heat energy when they change phase and are able to store and release large amounts of latent heat over a defined temperature range. In the construction business, combining building materials with PCMs is an efficient way to improve the thermal energy storage capacity of construction elements.
“However, one problem with phase-change materials is that they typically work only in one temperature range,” the scientists stated. “That means two different materials would be needed for summer and winter, which increases … cost.” In order to address this issue, the NREL team changed the transition temperature (Tm) of a PCM using ions with very modest voltage requirements. The transition temperature is the minimum temperature at which a material changes its crystal structure to another.
A dual-ion battery (DIB) was utilized to electrochemically modify the concentration of salt in the PCM and, as a consequence, change its Tm in a reversible and dynamic manner.” In a DIB, a PCM with a high initial salt concentration and low Tm serves as the electrolyte for the device,” the scientists explained. “Electrochemical charging stores the cations and anions in the negative and positive electrodes, respectively.”
The PCM, salt, and electrodes were optimized to make the DIB work as a dynamically tunable device. “It functions like a thermal and electric battery,” the research corresponding author, Gao Liu, said. “What’s more, this capability increases the thermal storage potential because of the ability to tune the melting point of the material depending on different ambient temperatures.”
The proposed technology is claimed to reduce the cost of storage, as the same material can be used for the whole year instead of just half of it. “If we use thermal energy storage, in which the raw materials are more abundant to meet the demand for thermal loads, this will relax some of the demand for electrochemical storage and free up batteries to be used where thermal energy storage cannot be used,” said research co-author, Sumanjeet Kaur.
All the details on the storage technology can be found in the study Dynamic tunability of phase-change material transition temperatures using ions for thermal energy storage, which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science. “In large scale building construction, this combined thermal and electrical energy storage capability would allow the material to store excess electricity produced by on-site solar or wind operations, to meet both thermal (heating and cooling) and electrical needs,” the academics concluded.
