A report published by the US firm last week stated its analysis suggested “a delivered hydrogen price of $6.59/kg is now sufficient to make green ammonia cheaper than “gray” ammonia, made from unabated natural gas on a short-run, marginal cost basis. This is just enough for a green ammonia facility in Germany to be competitive.” Bloomberg added, prices would be even lower for countries such as Spain, India, and China.
Australia is moving forward its hydrogen plans with the government today launching the Australia-Germany Hydrogen Innovation and Technology Incubator, known as HyGate. “The HyGate initiative will support real-world pilot, trial and demonstration projects that bring together Australian and German industry and research partners to deliver innovative hydrogen technology projects,” Australia's Ministry for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction said.
That announcement came just hours after Canberra on Monday awarded Volt Advisory Group AUS$18.75 million (US$13.8 million) over three years to develop a renewable energy microgrid for the Daintree region. The clean power network will feature an 8MW solar farm, 20MWh of battery storage capacity, and a 1MW clean hydrogen plant.
And Australia's Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) has signed a memorandum of understanding with European multinational aerospace company Airbus to examine challenges related to green hydrogen regulation, infrastructure and supply chains. “Today’s announcement reflects FFI’s and Airbus’ shared ambition to leverage their respective expertise to support the entry-into-service of a green-hydrogen based aircraft by 2035,” FFI wrote today.
Japanese heavy equipment manufacturer Kawasaki Heavy Industries says its Suiso Frontier liquefied hydrogen transport vessel returned to the Hy touch Kobe liquefied hydrogen terminal it built at Kobe on Feb. 25, carrying hydrogen generated from coal in the Australian state of Victoria. “Kawasaki will continue to test cargo handling and conduct data verification to ensure a successful outcome for the project to achieve our vision of building a global hydrogen supply chain,” wrote the Japanese company last week.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has signed a memorandum of understanding with Egypt’s Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy and the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources to assess low-carbon hydrogen in the country. “The bank’s assessment will include mapping the current and future expected international supply and demand of the hydrogen market, analyzing existing and potential hydrogen production in Egypt, and valuing the storage, conversion and transportation of hydrogen and its derivatives,” the EBRD wrote yesterday, adding it will also help conduct regulatory analysis.
New York-based climate data company DClimate has announced a partnership with the University of Namibia to verify the African nation’s carbon impact and sustainability initiatives. DClimate will establish a blockchain-native registry and verification system for quantifying the country’s carbon sequestration and emissions as well as credits from green hydrogen projects. “DClimate’s data platform promises to accurately capture Namibia’s effort to fight climate change and enable us to monetize green hydrogen in a scalable manner, said Namibia's presidential economic advisor and hydrogen commissioner, James Mnyupe. “This partnership is in line with Namibia’s intentions to diversify its funding sources, as articulated in its Integrated National Financing Framework.”

Dubbed Hide and Shine Floating Solar (HAS FPV), the system is claimed to be particularly suitable for countries where hurricanes and typhoons are frequent or which have other, frequent harsh weather conditions. The system design consists of a smart assembly of existing market components.
“A submersing solution is maybe a bit more expensive to construct but it may also result in lower costs for weather insurance, anchoring and construction while providing a longer lifespan,” the research coordinator, Johan Bakker, told pv magazine. “The modular system is currently being built by a group of Dutch companies including Easyfix Solar, EQAenergy, and Aveco de Bondt, among others.”
The HAS FPV system is designed with different buoys. The first full-scale raft is made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) polymer and easy-fix aluminum and fibers. “With little water pumping, the raft will increase in weight and will submerge and surface by changing ballast,” Bakker explained. “During the submerging time, the solar modules are switched off.”

The system is said to provide advantages for less windage, and for dry-up situations. “Our system is aimed essentially at minimizing storm damage during a 20-year lifespan and making construction lighter and suitable for bio-based fibers and lightweight modules,” Bakker went on to say, noting that conventional waterproof panels with an IP68 enclosure may be easily utilized. “We also tested submersing glass-glass bifacial modules and prepared special junction boxes during several months.”
The modules can be submerged totally or partially, depending on the weather conditions, and in case of a severe storm the panels can be submerged up to two meters below the surface.
The consortium plans to deploy the first pilot project, relying on 50 solar modules, at a water reservoir in Weurt, near the town of Nijmegen in the Dutch province of Gelderland in a few weeks' time. “The aim of this pilot is to research [and] develop the system for balancing, floating, and control behavior, in different weather circumstances, especially storm conditions,” Bakker emphasized.
In 2018, Waterschap Rivierenland joined forces with Dutch companies Blue21 and Hakkers NV, and with the Photovoltaic Materials and Devices (PVMD) unit of the Netherlands’ Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) to develop a new floating PV technology dubbed Innozowa. The first pilot project for this technology was also implemented at the water reservoir in Weurt.

A press release issued today by Acwa Power to announce the signing of a power purchase agreement connected to the 700MW Ar Rass solar project stated: “During the signing ceremony, the minister of energy announced that the energy sector aims to launch several renewable energy projects to produce approximately 15,000MW of clean energy between the years 2022 and 2023, with the aim of diversifying the energy mix and achieving its designated targets.”
It was not clear whether the statement of intent made by Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud related to 15GW of renewable energy generation capacity or clean energy facilities sufficient to generate 15GWh of green electricity. Nor was it clear whether the projects would be completed by the end of next year, or merely launched. pv magazine has asked Acwa Power for clarification.
Acwa, which said it has been tasked with commissioning 70% of the 58.7GW of clean energy project capacity required by the kingdom's National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) this decade – some 41.09GW – announced government body the Saudi Power Procurement Company (SPPC) has signed a 25-year power purchase agreement to buy the electricity to be generated at the Ar Rass project, in Al Qassim province.
The energy company did not state how much the SPPC will pay for the power generated at the $450 million site, which Acwa said is expected to reach financial close in the final quarter of this year and which it expects to be operational by 2025.
The solar project, in central Saudi Arabia, is set to generate enough electricity to power 132,000 homes, once fully operational, Acwa said, and will be 40.1% owned by the power company, 39.9% owned by Chinese state-owned entity the State Power Investment Corp, and 20% owned by the Water and Electricity Holding Company which is held by Saudi sovereign wealth fund the Public Investment Fund.
Acwa said Ar Rass will be the largest facility developed under the NREP program to date.

Zhonghuan Semiconductor on Friday announced its 160um-thick wafers had risen in price by RMB0.25 (US$0.04) to RMB6.65 (US$1.05) per piece for a rise of 4% since the previous announcement, on Jan. 26.
Longi followed suit yesterday, raising the price of its “M10” 182mm, “size P” products RMB0.20 (US$0.03) per piece to RMB6.70 (US$1.06).
Both producers made no change to the price of their other wafers, with Zhonghuan Semiconductor's 210mm wafers pegged at RMB8.85 (US$1.40) per piece and Longi charging RMB5.45 (US$0.86) for its M6, 166/223mm products and RMB5.25 (US$0.83) for its G1, 158.75/223mm output.
Solar prices have continued to rise since January, with solar panel input material polysilicon having risen from RMB230/kg (US$36.38) in early January to RMB243.60 (US$38.53) this week. Wafers have followed the trend, with Zhonghuan Semiconductor having charged RMB5.70 (US$0.90) per piece at the end of December for its 182mm products, and RMB7.70 (US$1.22) for the 210mm variety. That means Friday's prices marked rises of 16.7% and 14.5%, respectively, since the end of 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/08/solar-parks-could-help-to-increase-rainfall-in-arid-regions/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,SAUDI ARABIA",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"MARCH 8, 2022",Solar parks could help to increase rainfall in arid regions,"Large solar plants can act as rainmakers, according to a new modeling study. The report claims that utility-scale PV deployment in Saudi Arabia's arid Red Sea coastal plain could dramatically increase rainfall.
There is growing interest in the idea of artificially increasing rainfall on the Arabian Peninsula, through techniques such as cloud seeding. There is a lot of water in the air in the region because the Red Sea loses 0.7 teratons of water each year through evaporation, which is equivalent to almost 8% of the mass of all the water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere. On the Red Sea coast, sea breezes circulate this water over land, but it hardly ever falls as rain. Instead, it is transported south toward the equator and the central Indian Ocean.
Georgiy Stenchikov, an expert in climate and atmospheric modeling at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia, is investigating how changing surface albedo – the reflectivity of the earth – in the region could affect water transport, and whether this could change rain patterns.
Stenchikov and his colleagues performed a series of numerical simulations on a regional research model and weather forecast. They focused on three scenarios: extensive forest plantation, albedo increase, and albedo decrease.
Their simulations showed that extended afforestation and increased surface albedo along the Arabian Red Sea coastal plain could reduce rainfall. The region's sea breezes are driven by the horizontal thermal contrast between land and sea. The warmer land and the cooler sea create a pressure gradient that pushes moist sea air toward the land. Models show that afforestation and a more reflective surface cool the land, which dampens sea breezes and reduces the movement of water vapor from the sea to the land.
According to the researchers, solar panels are known to alter the energy balance of the surface by absorbing solar energy and heating up the surface. As a result, the deployment of large PV plants could change the reflectivity of the terrain enough to alter the circulation of air on the coast.
“We find that extended afforestation and increased surface albedo are not effective in triggering rainfall over the Red Sea coastal plains,” Stenchikov said. “Conversely, decreasing surface albedo to 0.2 assuming installation of solar panels over the coastal plains, increases surface air temperature by 1-2 K, strengthens horizontal surface temperature differences between sea and land, intensifies breezes, increases water vapor mixing ratio in the boundary layer above 3 km by about 0.5 gkg−1, enhances vertical mixing within the Planetary Boundary Layer, and generates 1.5 Gt of extra rainwater, equivalent to the annual consumption of 5 million people.”
The research team claimed that this form of regional geo-engineering of the earth's surface, coupled with advanced methods of freshwater collection and underground storage, could offer a feasible solution to mitigate the existing water crisis in arid coastal regions.
The scientists presented their findings in “Sea Breeze Geoengineering to Increase Rainfall over the Arabian Red Sea Coastal Plains,” which was recently published in the Journal of Hydrometeorology by the American Meteorological Society.

US-owned Indian ratings agency ICRA has estimated green hydrogen can be produced for $5 per kilogram at Indian sites where renewables generation capacity and electrolyzers are co-located.
A study, by Gurgaon-based ICRA, calculated the cost per kilogram would rise between 50 US cents and a dollar if electrolyzers are powered by off-site renewables wheeling electricity via intra-state grids, with the cost of such clean electricity estimated at INR3.50/kWh ($0.045), including wheeling and transmission charges.
To minimize the cost of green hydrogen, Berkshire Hathaway-owned ICRA said, battery energy storage and energy banking – a system which offers electricity generators the chance to feed excess electricity into the grid and draw it down at a later point – would need to be available.
ICRA estimated battery-backed round-the-clock clean energy would cost INR4-6/kWh ($0.052-0.078), depending on the extent of storage capacity required.
The report said the green hydrogen policy recently notified by India's Ministry of Power would drive big demand for renewables capacity in the nation, with around 60GW extra needed if the country is to source just 30% of its hydrogen demand this decade from the green form of the energy storage medium.
Most of the 6 million-ton demand for hydrogen in India in fiscal year 2019-20 came from industry, for use in refining, fertilizers and chemicals, and ICRA expects the market to grow 3.5-4% annually to the end of 2029-30. Current demand is almost entirely met by fossil-fuel-powered “grey” hydrogen.
Girishkumar Kadam, senior VP and co-group head for corporate ratings at ICRA, said: “The policy by the Ministry of Power [of the] government of India (GOI) for green hydrogen has various supportive measures and thus, remains a positive step. Even in a scenario of 30% of hydrogen demand to be met through green hydrogen by 2030, [the] incremental renewable (RE) capacity requirement is estimated to remain significant, at about 60GW. This is over and above the RE addition [needed] to meet all India[‘s] energy requirements.
“From the industrial off-taker’s perspective, green hydrogen is currently estimated to remain costlier by about $3.50-4/kg against grey hydrogen. The cost competitiveness of green hydrogen would remain contingent upon the reduction in capital cost, and an improvement in the energy efficiency level of, electrolyzer[s], besides the cost of RE procurement.”
Kadam's fellow VP and co-group head for corporate ratings, Prashant Vasisht, said, of India's current hydrogen demand: “With green hydrogen being, currently, costlier, as against grey hydrogen, [a] switch to the use of green hydrogen by the fertilizer sector will require a commensurate increase in the subsidy support from the GOI to mitigate the higher cost of production. In the case of phosphatic fertilizers, manufacturers may focus on procurement of green ammonia instead of green hydrogen, as [an] ammonia-manufacturing facility may require significant investments, thus providing an opportunity to standalone green ammonia manufacturers too.”

“Rising carbon prices especially in the EU in the last year has indeed substantially increased the competitiveness of renewables and thus even further reduced the policy costs of deployment,” researcher Michael Pahle told pv magazine. “But with increasing shares of renewables the carbon price will depend more and more on their investment costs, and certain factors could invert the current trend of a persistent decrease of these costs.”
They said in “Safeguarding the energy transition against political backlash to carbon markets” – recently published in Nature Energy – that they applied their analysis to the emissions trading system (ETS) of the European Union. They explained that the transition from subsidies to carbon prices is imminent in many renewable energy markets, and that interest rates are on the rise across Europe. These two things combined could decrease the competitiveness of solar, wind, and other renewables and offer fossil fuel assets more oxygen in the current decade, they argued.
Emissions trading systems can only work properly if a reasonable upper limit for emissions is specified and can be maintained politically, even when prices rise steeply. But the scientists said that this trend means that the emissions cap will be softened via the injection of additional allowances, which points to the potential disruption of renewable energy expansion.
“The decrease of competitiveness due to these two effects implies that the allowance price in the ETS grows faster in absolute terms and becomes bent in the later phase,” they said, noting that this price trajectory is described in the scientific literature as “hockey-stick shaped.”
In order to analyze future scenarios, the academics used the LIMES-EU long-term investment model for the electricity sector, which was developed by the PIK itself to assess the European power system at both the national and supranational level. It assumed that the allowance market rules introduced by the European Union in 2018 will be fully implemented. Those provisions include the market stability reserve (MSR), which is a mechanism to reduce supply-demand imbalances by significantly lowering the auction volume of allowances.
“Although this reform only entails a tightening of cap by means of canceling allowances through the MSR, a future reform might also entail in the opposite direction: an injection of additional allowances through the MSR, that is, a softening of the cap,” the scientists said.
They outlined two different scenarios. The first was a low-discount rate (LoDR) scenario, in which interest rates remain at the current level of around 0% and renewables keep being supported by public policies. Their second scenario was a high-discount rate (HiDR) situation, in which discount rates could rise by up to up to 5% and public incentives for renewables would be gradually phased out.
“By 2035, the renewable capacity in the LoDR scenario (1,447 GW) is around 535 GW higher than in the HiDR scenario (911 GW),” the scientists said. “In other words, the level reached in the HiDR scenario by 2035 is already reached around 2028 in the LoDR scenario, implying a ‘deployment time lag’ of around seven years between the two scenarios.”
The current trends of low interest rates and falling technology costs do little to clarify the future trajectory of the European energy landscape.
“Such an approach overlooks that the last decade has been truly exceptional in terms of low and stable interest rates, and conditions are bound to change,” the authors of the paper warned. “Accordingly, the tide may turn against the competitiveness of renewables, which would further be exacerbated by phasing out renewable energy policies. In combination, this could drive allowance prices to a level that triggers political backlash, resulting in a softening of the cap.”
The scientists concluded by suggesting that policies supporting renewables should not continue “in the current form,” given that they have already achieved their primary goal, which was to help clean energy sources become economically and technologically mature. Instead, they proposed “de-risking measures” that address the downsides of market risk exposure and a swing in the general interest rate. However, incentives for clean energy should be reduced from current levels, and more research should be conducted on how carbon price dynamics affect political feedback.
“This work highlights that policymakers and researchers should not be lured into thinking that due to falling renewable energy technology costs, the energy transition is now failsafe and that carbon markets will incentivize renewable energy deployment,” said the scientists.

The Victorian government has announced AU$1.98 million (US$1.46 million) in funding, to be shared between nine community-led renewable projects in the Latrobe Valley area, traditionally Victoria’s coal stronghold.
The funding is part of the state government’s AU$3 million (US$2.21 million) Latrobe Valley Energy and Growth Program, of which AU$1 million was allocated last year.
The projects funded include a floating solar demonstration project at Lardner Park which has been allocated almost AU$210,000 (US$155,000). The solar project, led by the Gippsland Climate Change Network, will use the “under-utilized” lake to ensure viable land for agriculture remains free, simultaneously reducing evaporation and preventing algae growth.
The print edition of pv magazine, which hits the streets tomorrow, will investigate the rapid rise of TOPCon cell manufacturing. While not the only option PV manufacturers have their eye on, TOPCon is already the first n-type cell to claim significant market share. We chart the tech’s progress from laboratory to gigawatt production plus efforts to standardize process flows, reduce costs, and raise performance.
Nearly AU$240,000 (US$177,000) in funding will go to the Earthworker Energy Manufacturing Cooperative to design, develop and manufacture portable solar-battery systems to assist emergency services during extreme weather events. Earthworker has a worker-owned factory – hence the ‘cooperative’ – in Morwell, where solar hot water technology and heat pumps are already being made.
More than AU$390,000 (US$288,000) will also be provided to the Yarram Recreation Reserve to install solar, a battery, and a portable renewable energy system to ensure the local state emergency services, fire authority and Red Cross – which use the reserve – will have access to power during outages and emergencies.
The other projects to receive funding include solar installations for the Yallambee Aged Care Energy Optimisation Demonstration, the Renewable Growth for Heyfield Project, and the Gippsland Employment Skills Training Project.
Two storage projects have also receive a cut, including Sunny Afternoons, which has been allocated more than AU$210,000 to install battery energy storage systems at dairy farms in the Latrobe Valley.
Finally, the Wellington Shire Council has been funded to complete a feasibility study for a geoexchange/geothermal technology system, though no more details of the project, nor the precise allocation of funding are known.
Victoria’s minister for energy, environment and climate change, Lily D’Ambrosio, who announced the funding on Monday, said the nine projects will mean regional Victoria remains “a leader in energy, engineering, and innovation.”
“This is about supporting local businesses to deliver renewable energy systems that not only slash emissions and electricity bills but provide power during extreme weather events [and] improve community resilience,” she added.
State parliament member for Eastern Victoria, Harriet Shing, said the projects would also ensure the coal heartland makes the most of its skilled workforce and transmission infrastructure.
The first AU$1 million round of funding for the Latrobe Valley program went to the Ramahyuck District Aboriginal Corporation to construct a 4.9MW solar farm. The Ramahyuck Solar Farm, announced in September last year, will be the first solar farm wholly owned and operated by an Aboriginal Corporation and the first on Aboriginal-owned land in Victoria.
The Ramahyuck District Aboriginal Corporation also received funding to install install solar arrays atop the Heyfield and District Museum, Coongulla Community Hall, Heyfield Golf Club, and Heyfield Tennis Club.

In August, NASA plans to send a tennis-court sized craft on a 1.5-billion-mile journey to the Psyche asteroid, which the craft shares its name with. The Psyche craft will be winged with two large cross-shaped solar arrays, which will power its measurement devices and propulsion system.
The solar propulsion craft, developed by Maxar Technologies, is currently undergoing testing. Engineers from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory recently demonstrated the solar array’s fold-out capabilities.
About an hour after launch, the arrays will deploy sequentially, first with the center column unfolding, and then the two cross-panels unfurling and latching into place. One wing at a time, the total deployment takes about seven and a half minutes.
It is the largest solar array deployed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said NASA. It is so large that the entire craft could not be unfolded during a test at Arizona State University’s lab in Tempe. ASU has partnered with NASA on the mission, which will observe the suspected unusually high amount of metals in the thickest band of the asteroid.
Psyche will use a Falcon heavy rocket to escape Earth’s gravity, but after that it will rely on the solar array and Hall thrusters to travel. Hall thrusters are propelled by xenon gas and require a small amount of electricity to run.
On Earth, the solar array can generate about 21kW of electricity, but far away from the sun alongside Psyche, it will only produce 2kW – about the same energy demand as a hair dryer. Despite this low amount of energy, it will be sufficient to power the planned three-and-a-half-year journey to the asteroid, and the two years of orbiting and observation of the body. Maxar’s cell technology is not fundamentally different from panels used on Earth, but design considerations were made to keep weight minimal, and resistance to radiation at a maximum.
“Even in the beginning, when we were first designing the mission in 2012, we were talking about solar electric propulsion as part of the plan. Without it, we wouldn’t have the Psyche mission,” said Arizona State University’s Lindy Elkins-Tanton, who leads the mission. “And it’s become part of the character of the mission. It takes a specialized team to calculate trajectories and orbits using solar electric propulsion.”
The Psyche craft is expected to make first contact with the Psyche asteroid in 2026.

For years women have been underrepresented in these areas, making up just 28% of the workforce according to a recent US study. Men not only greatly outnumber women majoring in STEM subjects at university, but their average annual salaries are significantly higher than their female peers – adding the pay gap to the gender gap.

For me, engineering was a natural choice when preparing for university – as it should for any young adult passionate about following their dreams, whatever they may be. At about six years old, I started visiting the factory my father owned which produced metallic accessories for clothing. It was an end-to-end production line: from sourcing the raw materials to designing and creating the molds, to manufacturing the end products – zips and buttons.
Ever since I have been fascinated by how things are made and work. I completed my diploma in Chemical Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens, before leaving for the US to complete a Master of Science in Environmental Engineering and Science at Stanford University, and a Master of Design and Innovation for Sustainability at Cranfield University in the UK.
One of my pledges during my very first steps as an engineer and scientist was to always work towards a greener future. Environmental sustainability will never be accomplished if we do not find a viable solution for energy supply and storage.
We must solve the puzzle of how to provide clean energy without putting an extra burden on our planet – a burden that the environment can simply no longer bear. As an engineer, I believe that anything is possible. If you can come up with an idea, you can make it happen.
The creativity with which we can solve problems is what inspires me on a day-to-day basis. And in order to solve complex problems like that, you need all hands on deck and diverse people who can bring unique and innovative perspectives. We simply cannot afford to do otherwise.
Our sector is not without its challenges. We work in a particularly demanding industry, which is not always straightforward. The hours are long, both at university when studying towards an engineering degree and once you become part of the workforce. But this is the same hurdle for both men and women. There are no strengths or weaknesses between the genders when it comes to hard work and long hours.
However, it must be said the energy sector has been traditionally dominated by men, especially in fossil fuel power generation. Women always had to work harder to get into the industry and, once in, to continue working harder to prove themselves, while men have enjoyed a head start.
The introduction of renewable energy, however, is gradually changing the landscape and leveling the field. More and more successful women are entering the energy sector, and at Sunlight Group I am both thrilled and honored to work with female peers and colleagues determined to create a greener future to tackle climate change. And at the same time, companies – especially innovative and forward-looking ones– are actively embracing diversity and gender balance, by optimizing recruitment processes and creating inclusive working environments.
Women around the world, from older women in small villages to younger women studying and working in big cities, have a story to share of how they plan to change their own world. All the women I have met in my life have a success story of their own to share, an inspiring tale to tell that helps all of us believe we can change things that don’t work anymore.
This is exactly what we need in the energy sector: women who can challenge the status quo, women who believe they can do the impossible. The energy sector needs unconventional solutions that will allow all countries to reach net-zero and preserve natural resources. Historically, women have been the ones to come up with unconventional solutions to big problems. The energy sector needs their out-of-the-box thinking now more than ever.
I would advise women to never give up, be bold, speak up and lead the way, even if you are the only woman in the room, which might still be the case in the energy sector. We are undergoing a huge transition, not only towards greener technologies but towards a different mindset, with gender balance being a definite part of the solution for a sustainable and greener future.
And whenever in doubt, we should always cast our mind back to Rachel Carson who fought fiercely to stop the Silent Spring around the world, while in a male-dominant environment. We, as women in the energy sector, must continue what she started back in the late 1950s with the same passion and diligence. It is what we owe to her generation, our own peers, and future generations alike.

Utility-scale solar and battery energy storage are set to become the dominant new source of energy capacity additions in the United States. Over the next two years, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts that the two technologies will jointly account for 60% of new capacity added to the US grid.
Of the total 85GW of capacity set to come online through 2023, solar and energy storage represents 51GW. The EIA said that in many cases, solar and storage are paired together in the same projects.
Rapidly falling battery prices and rising demand have driven the increase of energy storage attachment and standalone storage projects. Dependent on charging sources and the configuration of a project, battery energy storage units could be eligible for the solar investment tax credit (ITC), which is another driver of growth. The ITC is set to phase down by 2024. It is scheduled to be 26% in 2022, 22% in 2023, and 10% in 2024 and beyond.
Three US states will dominate the total share of new solar and energy storage capacity. Texas is expected to contribute 23% of new capacity with 12GW, while California will come second with 11GW, and New York will rank third with 4GW.
Utility-scale solar accounts for 48% of planned capacity in the United States over the next two years, said the EIA. The 22GW planned for 2022 is dramatically more than the 13GW added in 2021. In 2020 and 2021, utility-scale solar doubled natural gas, adding 24GW versus 12GW, respectively.
Over the next two years, the EIA expects 10GW of utility-scale battery storage capacity to be added, more than 60% of which will be co-located with solar installations. Roughly 3.1GW of battery storage was deployed in 2021.
The remainder of planned projects over the next two years, about 34GW, will come from natural gas (16GW) and wind (15GW). Wind capacity additions have notably dropped.
The EIA also recently said that it expects US energy use to rise through 2050, as population and economic growth outpace efficiency improvements. The EIA’s annual energy outlook for 2022 projects petroleum and natural gas will remain the highest sources of energy consumption through 2050, with transportation being the greatest contributor to fuel use.
