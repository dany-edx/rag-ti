The result, which was confirmed by the Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH), in Germany, improves on the company's previous record of 24.79%, achieved in July. “The record-breaking monocrystalline silicon solar cell was fabricated on a high quality, low defect CZ mono-Si substrate,” the company said in a statement. “Advanced diffusion with highly activated dopant, high-quality surface passivation, JinkoSolar highly conductive passivating contact technologies, and a series of innovative technologies and material upgrade[s] were integrated into the cell process,” the module maker said in a statement.
In January 2020, when the cell had, still, an efficiency of 24.2%, Jinko said its cell was based on its HOT design and featured tunnel-oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) technology. The cell features a 267.72cm2 monocrystalline silicon substrate grown using the Czochralski method.
More details on the cell technology were not disclosed and the company did not say when it could be applied to commercial production.

The lender has devoted the money, from its overseas-funded Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA), to easing the roll-out of off-grid renewable electricity networks across the continent.
The money from the SEFA funding stream – established by Denmark in 2011 and bolstered by public money from Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden the U.S. and the U.K. since – will be devoted to financing standardized mini-grid framework programs for four, unspecified nations; de-risking mini-grid finance; and sharing knowledge, innovation and skills training, according to a press release issued by the AfDB on December 22.
The development lender said the grant would be named the Africa Mini-grid Market Acceleration Programme and would be expected, in its initial phase, to provide 880,000 new electricity access points for 4 million people and to create 7,200 jobs, of which 1,800 would be for women.
Aaron Leopold, CEO of the Africa Minigrid Developers Association (AMDA), said: “Mini-grids are a fundamental but under-supported element of Africa’s energy future. To achieve SDG [sustainable development goal] 7 – the UN’s target for universal energy access – the sector must be radically scaled up and to do this, a holistic and broad-spectrum support program informed by industry needs is required, to bring governments, investors, and of course the mini-grid sector the kind of support that can facilitate fast and efficient progress. For these reasons, AMDA is excited to see AfDB working to bring mini-grid investments in Africa to the next level.”

France's Ministry of Ecological Transition has reported results from the third round of the 282 MW solar tender for non-interconnected zones (ZNI) launched in 2019, which is open to PV projects – including with those with a storage element – ranging in size from 100 kW to 5 MW.
In the round, 47 projects totaling 57 MW were selected in Corsica, Réunion, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte and Guiana. The tender's final average price was €0.0986/kWh, which is lower by $0.10 compared to the average price of the previous round.
Of the allocated capacity, 9.6 MW were assigned to installations with a capacity of between 100 kW and 500 kW on buildings or car park shades while another 13.5 MW were awarded to projects of the same kind with capacity from 500 kW to 1.5 MW. Furthermore, 33.9 MW was assigned in the category for ground-mounted PV plants with a power rating of 500 kW to 5 MW.
“Reunion island secured the largest number of winning projects as well as the greatest cumulative capacity in the round,” said Arthur Omont, from French consultant Finergreen, which analyzed the results of the tender. “The region once again demonstrates its attractiveness for developers with 21.6 MW of allocated power,” he stated. “Guadeloupe follows closely, with 20 MW of allocated capacity.”
The first two winning territories, Réunion and Guadeloupe, accounted for 73% of the total allocated capacity.
The capacity for Corsica was oversubscribed 2.5 times but, by contrast, only 17% of the hoped-for capacity in Martinique was allocated. The results of the third tranche are not yet known for Mayotte and Guiana, where the application period has been postponed because of the health crisis. “So far, 64% of the capacity has been allocated,” the consultant continued.
According to Finergreen, among the ten developers identified, Akuo Energy is far ahead, with 26.2 MW, or 46% of the power to be installed.
French independent power producer Albioma announced that it had obtained 17 projects with a total capacity of 7.6 MW. Finally, Quadran completed the winners' podium with 5.8 MW.
Next in the ranking were nw Energy (3.8 MW), Genergies (2.1 MW), Urbasolar (1.8 MW), Générale du Solaire (1.4 MW), Valeco (1.2 MW), Amarenco (0.9 MW) and Sunzil (0.9 MW).

A report run by the Reuters-linked Zawya Middle East news portal controlled by New York-based private equity group Blackstone – and reproduced by Dubai-based clean energy news site Globally Today – stated the Dabdaba project would be merged into the 2 GW Shagaya renewables field.
Zawya referred to a report carried by Kuwaiti daily newspaper Alanba which yesterday quoted sources at Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) who said the KPC, which had originally tendered the Dabdaba project, had cancelled the procurement and asked the Kuwait Authority for Partnership Projects (KAPP) to merge the solar field – variously reported as 1 GW and 1.5 GW in scale – with the 2 GW Shagaya clean energy site, 100km west of Kuwait City at Al Shagaya.
With KAPP promoting private sector involvement in Kuwaiti infrastructure, Alanba reportedly stated the merger would “serve government plans to expand public-private partnership.”
pv magazine has contacted Kuwait Petroleum Corporation to attempt to verify the report but is still awaiting a reply to a similar request made in July. Six months ago, Zawya – referencing Kuwaiti daily Al Rai – reported the bank guarantees lodged by the four shortlisted bidders to provide engineering, procurement and construction plus operations and maintenance services to the Dabdaba project were due to expire in mid July. The tender for Dabdaba – also described as Dibdibah, in a previous report – was reportedly supposed to have taken place by March 2018.
Yesterday's news report stated the project would be rolled into phase III of the 84km2 Shagaya renewables park. pv magazine reported in June 2013 that a 70 MW first phase of the “government-funded” 2 GW Shagaya development would feature PV, solar thermal and wind power generation and be operational by 2016.

Scientists around the world are looking for post-lithium storage technologies and an interesting option is represented by zinc-air batteries. These storage systems, however, still struggle with a high level of chemical instability, which ultimately leads to electrochemically-irreversible damage.
A group of researchers led by Wei Sun from the MEET Battery Research Center at the Westphalian Wilhelms University in Münster, wants to overcome the technical weaknesses of conventional zinc-air batteries by using innovative battery chemistry based on non-alkaline, aqueous electrolytes.
The results of their research, in which the Fudan University in Shanghai, the University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, the University of Maryland and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory were also involved, have been published in the journal Science. “Our innovative, non-alkaline electrolyte brings a previously unknown reversible zinc peroxide (ZnO2)/O2 chemistry to the zinc-air battery,” explained Sun.
Conventional electrolytes used thus far were strongly alkaline. The new battery chemistry is based on the salt of zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate, which is claimed to have several advantages, Sun said, noting that the zinc anode is used more efficiently thanks to its higher chemical stability and electrochemical reversibility.
The zinc-air batteries developed with this chemistry could be operated stably for 320 cycles and 1,600 hours. The influence of the ZnO2/O2 battery chemistry and the role of the hydrophobic trifluoromethanesulfonate anion were systematically investigated with the help of electrochemical and analytical techniques and with simulations formulated at multiple scales.
The scientists ascertained that the batteries have a higher energy density and that these devices can potentially compete with currently dominant lithium-ion storage systems. “However, this technology needs further, intensive research and optimization before it can be used in practice,” said Sun.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/06/brazil-may-add-9-gw-of-distributed-solar-over-next-two-years/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,BRAZIL",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 6, 2021",Brazil may add 9 GW of distributed solar over next two years,"“With the financial problems of our competitors, Aldo became the largest PV product distributor in Brazil this year”, said the president of Brazil's largest PV product distributor and system integrator, Aldo Pereira Teixeira, in an interview with pv magazine. “Currently, our market share is around 35 to 36 percent.”
Aldo currently focuses on the sale of residential, commercial, and industrial photovoltaic systems and only 3 percent of the company's revenue is concentrated on projects with a power greater than 1 MW, in which remote self-consumption is a priority. The situation of distributed generation in Brazil is still very promising, Pereira Teixeira added. “Brazil has 89 million consumer units and only 330,000 photovoltaic systems connected to the grid; we have a huge space to keep growing.”

The Covid-19 crisis only caused a sharp drop in the market in the months of April and May and it has now already recovered, reaching the same numbers as last year, he said. “And in the fourth quarter the numbers are much higher than last year. Aldo's turnover will grow 50% this year.”
The distributed generation segment, which in Brazil includes all solar power generators not exceeding 5 MW in size, should experience in 2020 a 50% growth compared to 2019. “The forecast is that by the end of 2020, the market will reach 4.5 GW of installed power with 360,000 consumer units, with 180,000 new units added this year alone,” Aldo's head specified. “For 2021, the estimated growth should be at least another 4 GW and 360,000 new consumer units and, for 2022, we estimate it will be another 5 GW of installed power and another 400,000 new consumer units.”
The recent regulatory changes introduced by the Brazilian government, in his view, affected the market mainly in terms of photovoltaic system prices, which fell 40%. “But panel prices have also dropped in China and globally,” he added. “And luckily Brazil decided to eliminate the import tax on the panels, which allowed it to maintain a good breakeven in the investment of 40 or 45 months.” So far, however, the so-called “ex-tarifários”, which reduced the panel import tax by 12%, has had no impact in terms of increased sales.
This is because the government has limited the cost, insurance and freight (CIF) value of this equipment in reais, which has suffered due to the exchange rate variation, with the dollar at the highest rates ever seen. “In the case of inverters, on the other hand, the rate reduction was 14% and this reduction had a positive impact on the final price because the values were not linked to the CIF,” he said. At the moment, what is impacting the final value is the cost of international freight, which has a direct impact on CIF. Although there is now a favorable dollar, freight is what hinders the reduction of values. “The forecast for commercial growth in the sale of panels using the reduction in the rate of the ex-tarifários should happen in the second quarter of 2021, when the international maritime freight costs are expected to be normal,” he added.
The government's action, according to Pereira Teixeira, was adequate not only to solve the import tax issue, but also to answer the question of the unfavorable exchange rate, which is affecting the entire Brazilian economy. “The government could quickly enable the approval of a bill that would serve as a legal framework for the distributed generation in Brazil, bringing even more certainty and, consequently, greater growth to the sector,” he said.
Underlining the difficulties of the residential segment with respect to the commercial and industrial segments in Brazil, the Aldo CEO said the main problem remained the dissemination of information about the technology. “Greater education would allow many homeowners to know that they can take care of their expenses and at the same time the environment, allowing more water to stay in the dams and reducing pollution,” he said.
As for project financing, historically Brazil has never had such a low-interest rate, with the Selic rate (Brazil's basic interest rate) of 2.0% per year. “This is the lowest rate in decades,” he noted. “With lower interest rates than those currently practiced, the Brazilian financial system favors financing to be more accessible for residential and commercial projects.” The conditions are thus very advantageous and guarantee even more development for the sector, he added. “Today, at Aldo Solar, 45% of all sales are made through financing from the financial system.”
When asked if Brazil could become a country that manufactures photovoltaic components, Pereira Teixeira said that the country did not have a semiconductor industry and, therefore, the manufacture of panels would not make much sense. “The same manufacturers that already exist in Brazil have to import all raw materials from Asia,” he said. “In that sense, we can become more product assemblers than true producers.” For this reason, Brazilian photovoltaic products, including inverters, can be 30% more expensive than those imported from China.
Regarding the quality levels of the Brazilian photovoltaic market, Teixeira Pereira said that this issue was a priority for the distributed generation business, where there are no contracts with the state or auctions of any kind. “Aldo's main suppliers are JinkoSolar, Trina, SMA, Fronius, Fimer, Refusol, Growatt, and also BYD, which we know has a panel factory here in São Paulo and also sells batteries,” he said. “We always select quality and value to make projects that have to last between 25 and 30 years.”
According to his estimates, the Brazilian market will soon have a 70 percent majority share of monocrystalline PERC panels, while polycrystalline products will fall further to have a 30 percent share. These weeks Aldo is launching the new high-power modules from major Chinese manufacturers such as Jinko and Trina, albeit in small versions, with a power of around 440 W, which can be used in roof projects. “These modules are a little more expensive than conventional panels, but allow for a lower final installation cost.” Undoubtedly, these panels will be the most sold in Brazil from the first quarter of 2021 and should have an 80% share because they are made exclusively for distributed generation and serve the vast majority of roof projects in Brazil, Teixeira Pereira explained. “These panels are more efficient, lighter and have a longer service life and are already in line with the 182 mm and 210 mm cell technology trend.”
Regarding the possibility of expanding the company's business abroad, Pereira Teixeira said that it would take at least 10 years for the Brazilian market to become saturated. “And until then, we want to continue growing and maintain our leadership here,” he commented. “Brazil is still taking its first steps in solar energy.”

This is the main conclusion of the study On capital utilization in the hydrogen economy: The quest to minimize idle capacity in renewables-rich energy systems, conducted by researchers of Germany's Hertie School of Governance, and Norwegian research institute Sintef Industry, and published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.
In the paper, the scientists outlined four different future low-carbon scenarios, two of which describe green hydrogen from renewables as prevailing over blue hydrogen, from natural gas, and two presenting the opposite outcome.
All the scenarios take into consideration how the intermittency of renewable energy may affect capital utilization across the entire electricity-hydrogen system, including transmission and storage infrastructure. “All elements of this integrated system must be included in the optimization to accurately represent the cost of reduced capital utilization caused by variable renewable energy integration (VRE),” the academics explained. “The main finding is that capacity utilization imposes an important economic constraint on VRE integration using hydrogen, regardless of the chosen system development pathway.”
The research team said that different solutions can be applied to shift the cost deriving from low utilization rates from one part of the energy system to another. “Blue hydrogen scenarios are less sensitive due to less VRE deployment, reducing total system costs by the equivalent of about 1% of GDP relative to green hydrogen scenarios,” it stated, adding that a cost-optimal solution was proposed to avoid idle capital in each of the four scenarios. Referring to green hydrogen and its chances to prevail, the academics stressed that its future will depend on the availability of wind power resources, as producing hydrogen with solar alone would result in higher electrolyzer costs, although PV is projected to become cheaper than wind.
In the green hydrogen scenarios, grid costs were found to influence the attractiveness of co-locating electrolyzers with demand, while renewables-electrolysis co-location was influenced by the costs of electrolyzers, as well as by hydrogen transmission and storage costs.”Optimistic technology cost reductions allow large overbuilds of VRE, electrolysis and transmission infrastructure; but such large capital expansion increases the likelihood of cost escalations from public resistance to wind turbines, transmission lines and hydrogen pipelines,” the researchers emphasized.
The blue hydrogen scenarios face similar constraints, although their sensitivity to capacity utilization is mainly limited to the natural gas price. “Low financing costs are key to the realization of these energy systems, particularly those relying on green hydrogen,” the authors of the study concluded. “High discount rates, reflecting the high risk and uncertainty inherent in a rapid and complete overhaul of the global energy system, strongly increase the cost of low capacity utilization.”

According to Chinese module maker Longi, which supplied its products for the projects, the two facilities, each of which have a capacity of 35 MW, were deployed on the Gia Hoet 1 and Tam Bo irrigation lakes, in the commune of Quang Thanh, located in the district of Chau Duc.
The panel manufacturer said the two plants represent the largest floating PV plant cluster in the Southeast Asia region. Currently, there is only one other operational floating solar power project in the country. Operated by Vietnamese hydropower producer Da Mi Hydropower Joint Stock Co., a unit of Vietnamese power utility Electricity of Vietnam (EVN), the plant has an installed power of 47.5 MW.
The entire project is owned by Vietnamese electric equipment provider Toji Group. “Despite the challenging rainy and stormy conditions made more difficult with COVID-19 related issues, Toji Group was able to complete the 110 kV substation installation, 10.8 km of transmission line development and grid integration in just four months,” Longi said, referring to the Tam Bo plant. “Similarly, the Ho Gia Hoet 1 plant included the solar power station of 35 MWp, 22/110 kV step-up transformer substation and 1.86 km of transmission line running from Gia Hoet 1 to Tam Bo 22/110 kV step-up transformer substation.”
Longi provided 74,469 panels with a power output of 470 W for both schemes, which were likely developed under Vietnam's FIT scheme for solar.

The cell, which is claimed to be suitable for power-generating window applications, was built through a single-stage co-evaporation process characterized by a constant evaporation rate of the elements as well as constant deposition temperature during the film deposition. This, according to the researchers, enables precise control of the film thickness and chemical composition of the deposited ultrathin
CIGS absorber.
“Moreover, the simplicity and speed of this process can increase the uptime of the CIGS deposition system significantly, resulting in fabrication cost reduction and productivity yield improvement,” they stated, adding that the process is particularly designed to develop cells with transparent conducting oxide (TCO) rear contacts.
The Korean group built the cell with two types of TCO rear contacts, one based on a textured 650 nm thick film made of texture F-doped Tin(IV) oxide (SnO2:F) and another one based on a 200 nm thick flat film made of indium tin oxide (In2O3:Sn). “Each elemental metal was deposited simultaneously at calculated evaporation rates, and the thickness of the CIGS films was controlled at 200, 300, and 400 nm by varying the deposition time,” it further explained.
A textured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer with light-scattering and antireflection properties was applied to the cell to improve light absorption. The device with the In2O3:Sn film was found to have the highest fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (VoC) as well as the best performance with the above-mentioned values for conversion efficiency and average visible transmittance. “The textured PDMS layer mitigated large reflection losses on the device surface while improving light trapping within it, resulting in an increase in short-circuit current (JSC) without adversely affecting VOC and FF,” the academics stressed. “The textured PDMS layer has a high haze factor of more than 90%, a high optical transmittance of more than 80% in the wavelength range of 350–1100nm, and a low optical reflectance of less than 10%.”
The cell is described in the paper Semitransparent and bifacial ultrathin Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells via a single-stage process and light-management strategy, published in Nano Energy.

Redflow’s Gen3 battery customer trial, which is already underway and scheduled to be complete by the middle of the month, is one of the final steps before the Australian energy storage company begins producing its latest model. Already boasting the world’s smallest commercially available flow batteries, the ZCell and ZBM2, Redflow are looking to move into mass production techniques for the first time with its Gen3, ultimately lowering cost barriers.
To assess how the Gen3 battery performs in a live environment, Reflow installed two of the new models in doctor James Emmett’s off-grid Mount Tamborine property in Queensland in December.
“After the end of the trial in mid-January, Redflow will take the batteries back to its headquarters in Brisbane to examine their performance compared to its current generation of zinc-bromine flow batteries,” Redflow CEO and Managing Director, Tim Harris, told pv magazine Australia.
“Battery performance will be evaluated from a broad range of measures including battery efficiency, temperature tolerance and discharge curves, allowing Redflow to tweak and refine the Gen3 battery design, if necessary, before going into production in the first half of this year.”
“This is an important development milestone for Redflow’s Gen3 battery to become customer and production ready in 2021,” Harris said.
Reflow’s 10 kWh zinc-bromine flow batteries are designed for deep cycling, long-duration stationary energy storage applications and are able to tolerate harsh work conditions. The company’s Gen3 model has a number of design changes from the previous ZCell and ZBM2 models. These include a side by side tank design and a single, rather than double, stack – both of which the company say will reduce manufacturing costs.
“With Gen3, we are confident of achieving a 30% reduction in manufacturing costs through supply chain and engineering productivity impacts,” Harris said in a statement about the customer trial announcement.

The Minneapolis-based utility is accepting proposals from developers to build solar projects of at least 75 MW that interconnect to the existing infrastructure at the Sherco plant. Proposals will be accepted until 5 p.m. on Feb. 2.
The projects would create an estimated 25 permanent positions, pending approval by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.
Xcel said it expects the solar installations to be running by 2024, following the retirement of the first Sherco coal unit. Xcel plans to fully phase out all coal plants in Minnesota by 2030.
