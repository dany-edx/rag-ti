Augwind, an Israeli air compressor and energy storage business, said it secured a 120 MWh slice of the storage capacity awarded and has signed a memorandum of understanding with the local unit of French energy giant EDF to install its proprietary AirBattery technology alongside a 5 MW solar array.
The state-owned Israeli Electricity Company (IEC) awarded 33 project contracts in the procurement exercise, amounting to 608 MW of solar generation capacity and 2.4 GWh of storage, with the winning bidders securing 23-year IEC power purchase agreements. The solar electricity price secured was ILS0.1745/kWh ($0.0544). The successful projects must be completed by July 2023.
Augwind said its technology reaches 75-81% efficiency for systems of at least 5 MW capacity. That is less than lithium-ion battery storage but compressed air systems are said not to degrade and to therefore benefit from effectively unlimited cycling.
The AirBattery works by using renewable electricity to compress air to seven bars of pressure in underground storage tanks. The air can be released when needed, turning a turbine to generate electricity.
A levelized cost of electricity of $0.05/kWh, plus 75-81% storage system efficiency, are significant landmarks for compressed air storage.
A study produced by the University of Edinburgh into the seasonal clean energy storage capacity of British saline aquifers estimated investment of $16-59 million into compressed air storage facilities would enable 77-96 TWh of renewable electricity to be stored for two months. Based on storage system efficiency of 54-59%, that would mean seasonally stored electricity with a levelized cost of electricity of $0.42-4.71/kWh.
“The data presented by Augwind today is excellent news for the world of renewable energies in general and the world of energy storage in particular, both in comparison with lithium batteries and alternative storage solutions,” said Augwind chief executive Or Yogev. “Augwind's AirBattery system has an energy efficiency that is generally similar to pumped storage stations' efficiency.
Compared to a storage system based on lithium batteries, despite their higher initial efficiency, lithium batteries have an obvious disadvantage in that their efficiency and structural capacity fade over the years and necessitate replacement and upgrade for a new storage system every few years or cycles. In addition, lithium-ion systems contain chemical components, some of which are not recyclable, while Augwind's solution is designed for decades, while also being green, environmentally friendly, and based solely on water and air.”

Net profit is estimated to RMB1.85-2.05 billion (US$308 million). That result would represent a 130% increase from 2019. Sungrow said the positive performance was due to increased orders during the Covid-19 crises and an improvement of its product portfolios.
Module maker Risen will likely ship around 15 GW of solar products this year, according to company president Xie Jian, who was speaking during an investor conference this week in which he also provided an update on the manufacturer's current and projected production capacity. “If everything go[es] smoothly with those projects under construction, Risen will obtain around 20 GW of solar cell capacity and 28 GW of solar PV module capacity by end of 2021,” Jian said.
Monocrystalline module producer Longi has held its wafer prices for February.

The business predicted the period to the end of March would see rising module prices as the result of production costs coming in 10-15% higher.
However, a return to price reductions in the second half of the year would drive another record period for the renewable energy technology, with IHS Markit predicting a 30% rise on the volume of solar project capacity added, compared to last year, with China still cornering 35% of the market.
The market data company also predicted a 5% annual fall in the capital expenditure cost of solar projects in 2021 thanks to “decreasing component prices,” and said conversion efficiency gains would continue to be made, with PERC mono modules passing 22.5% efficiency and hitting 24% by 2022.
Perovskites will become commercially viable “in the next five years,” said IHS Markit on Thursday.
The company also predicted renewables-powered green hydrogen costs would fall another 40% through 2025 thanks to falling renewable electricity prices and electrolyzer costs.
Electric vehicle makers will also lead a new push on recycling this year, according to IHS Markit.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/01/26/3-d-multi%e2%80%90ribbon-interconnection-tech-for-ibc-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BELGIUM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 26, 2021",3-D multi‐ribbon interconnection tech for IBC cells,"Researchers at the Belgian research institute Imec have tested a new 3-D multi‐ribbon interconnection technology in a few sample modules with interdigitated back‐contact (IBC) solar cells and have found that the modules show no significant degradation after 600 thermal cycles and very limited degradation after 800 cycles.
“This is the first time the technology is implemented in multi-cell modules with IBC cells,” Imec researcher Rik Van Dyck told pv magazine. “The technology was first tested using old, inefficient Metal Wrap Through (MWT) in 2019 and now we achieved nice reliable results and used proper IBC back-contact cells to show its potential.”
The proposed interconnection tech is based on a three-dimensional fabric of encapsulant with incorporated horizontal and vertical solder‐coated metal ribbons, which the scientists labeled as “cell‐to‐cell ribbons” and “busbar ribbons,” respectively. “These two layers of metal ribbons are separated by the encapsulant to provide electrical insulation between the different electrical phases,” they further explained. “At certain locations in the fabric, the busbar ribbons are stitched through the encapsulant, overlapping with the cell‐to‐cell interconnection ribbons.”
According to the Belgian team, this overlapping creates a floating connection point, which is a kind of connection ensuring that a connector adjusts its connection point when the shape moves. Each cell‐to‐cell ribbon has just one connection point with a busbar ribbon of each neighboring cell, which ensures lower thermal‐induced stress while increasing the reliability of the cells. “By interrupting the cell‐to‐cell ribbons on specific locations, the fabric gets a tapered design and one ribbon can be used for two opposite polarities, which can save on copper consumption,” highlighted the research group.
The combined lamination and soldering process used allows for soldering the busbar ribbons directly onto the cell fingers without the need for busbar printing on the cell. “This potentially cuts both processing steps and material consumption during cell manufacturing, further reducing the cost of the module,” the researchers stated. The technique must be implemented with relatively low lamination temperatures and a low-melting-temperature solder. “There is some adaptation required on [a] cell metallization level, but the used lamination temperatures and steps are compatible with current processing tools for module manufacturing,” Van Dyck added.
The interconnection technology was tested in one and four‐cell modules with front side and back side glass sheets, each with a thickness of 3mm. Heating and cooling cycles according to the IEC 61215 standard for thermal cycling reliability, were performed. The test showed that the fill factor and power output of both one-cell and four-cell devices was relatively stable, with imperceptible drops after 600 cycles. “These results demonstrate the module reliability in thermal cycling and prove the feasibility of the concept,” the scientists added. “They also prove that the encapsulant can act as a stable insulator between ribbons and cell metallization of opposite polarity.” The encapsulant is a glass-fiber-reinforced thermoplastic olefin.
The researchers are currently adapting standard encapsulation materials to enable their lamination process. The proposed interconnection technology is described in the paper Three‐dimensional multi‐ribbon interconnection for back‐contact solar cells, published in Progress in Photovoltaics.

In the study Providing large-scale electricity demand with photovoltaics and molten-salt storage, published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, the researchers presented a model to integrate solar power generation from utility scale facilities with high-temperature molten-salt storage in regions with low direct solar beam radiation and high levels of global solar radiation.
The PV-plus-thermal-storage (PV-TS) solution proposed by the academics, which is claimed to be “ready for immediate implementation,” due to the “unusually favorable economics” provided by PV technology, represents an alternative to CSP molten salt towers in areas where CSP technology is not considered viable because concentrators cannot exploit diffuse solar radiation. “Rather than aiming for precise answers for specific locations, the objective here is to see if the magnitudes for PV system size, storage capacity, grid penetration levels and cost estimates are feasible,” the academics explained.
In the PV-TS unit, a significant part of the generated solar power would be used to resistively heat molten-salt thermal storage to temperatures over 565 degrees Celsius, and the stored thermal energy would be in turn used to drive high-efficiency superheated steam turbines for power generation.
The simulations conducted by the Israeli-French group showed that in certain areas PV can see its grid penetration rate increase from around 30%, when no thermal storage is used, to around 80% with just 12 hours of thermal storage. “Furthermore, with only a 25% increase in solar input, 90% grid penetration can be attained,” the group further explained. “For the higher-insolation locations, where proportionality can be maintained up to approximately 90%, an extra 25% of solar input can raise grid penetration to about 95%.”
In this kind of project, the PV plant should not be sized as a common facility that needs to meet a particular peak daytime demand and most of the generated electricity should be used for heat storage in the molten salt tanks. “And that stored heat would satisfy the power demand not only at night, but also during daytime periods of sub-peak insolation,” the researchers specified, adding that an average land area of approximately 0.64km2 would be necessary for a terawatt-hour of annual power generation.
According to them, the “unconventional” solution proposed in the study may also be integrated with rooftop PV arrays and large steam turbines already operating in fossil fuel and nuclear power plants that are being decommissioned in several countries.
The findings of the research relate only to the U.S. territory but they could be extended to all regions with similar climatic conditions and utility demand profiles. “For regions with average insolation that is higher than the U.S. – some of which also happen to have electricity demand profiles that are better correlated with solar availability – the PV and storage requirements per terrawatt-hour of electricity consumption will be lower,” the paper notes. “Furthermore, the transition to all-electric vehicles may increase the fraction of electricity demand during daytime hours, when much of the battery charging will be performed.”
Russia, the former Soviet republics, Japan, northern Asia, and mid-to-northern Europe are pointed out as the most suitable areas, along with the United States, for the deployment of PV-TS projects.
The research team is composed of scientists from Israel's Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, France's Aix-Marseille University and Promes, which is the French national R&D laboratory on solar concentrating systems.

That development, on Friday, was followed a little later by the rival solar project business owned by GCL-Poly setting a February 10 date for a meeting to vote on a 430 MW project sell-off which could raise RMB2 billion (US$309 million) towards paying down more than RMB7 billion of debts due by June 30.
pv magazine reported in March that Shunfeng International had agreed to surrender its 59% stake in the LED business to satisfy creditor China Minsheng Banking Corp but that no longer appears to be the case.
Shunfeng announced the potential sale of its holding in the LED company on the last day of the year, with Nanchang Guanggu Group Ltd the buyer, at a price of RMB670 million. The rearrangement means Shunfeng will now have to settle the HK$150 million (US$19.4 million) it owes China Minsheng by June 30.
That appears to be among the less urgent of the company's debt commitments with six payments already overdue to various other creditors.
Sino Alliance Capital Ltd has been owed HK$400 million (US$51.6 million) since the end of 2019 and a further HK$800 million since December 31. An unnamed bondholder has been owed HK$350 million since March 25 and two other debts fell due six days later, with Donghai Securities Co Ltd claiming RMB362 million (US$55.9 million) and True Bold Global Ltd HK$172 million. Chongqing International Trust has been owed RMB666 million since September 30.
The projected sale of Lattice Power is expected to generate RMB391 million for Shunfeng, with the company pledging to use RMB341 million of the proceeds to pay down debt and keep RMB50 million for, apparently much-needed working capital. Shunfeng stated, on December 31, it would continue seeking an extension to debt payments from creditors and would also sell off solar projects, having already disposed of a third of its portfolio – 540 MW – in March.
In addition to the overdue commitments, and the looming China Minsheng debt, Shunfeng will also have to find RMB255 million for Shanghai Chi Yi Investments Management Co Ltd by April 25.
The details of the vote required to approve the Lattice Power sale, originally promised by Friday, will now be published by February 19, Shunfeng told the Hong Kong stock market on Friday.
Meanwhile, GCL-Poly's independent shareholders can be expected to vote through a sale of 18 solar project companies to two funds controlled by state-owned China Huaneng Group at their February 10 gathering. GCL on Friday announced the projected sales would amount to a book loss of RMB183 million but would generate RMB2 billion from the purchase price and receivables and dividends owed by the project companies to the parent.
GCL's update to the Hong Kong exchange said the company had RMB7.16 billion of debts due by June 30 and it had RMB667 million in the bank at the same date last year.
Holders of US$500 million of three-year GCL senior notes due to mature on Saturday had until today to signal whether to agree to postpone settlement of the instruments for a further three years.

French startups Ecosun Innovations and Mascara Nouvelles Technologies are trying to commercialize a PV-powered solution to desalinate brackish water and saltwater. They have described their Osmo-Watt solution as an autonomous, mobile drinking water production unit for isolated areas.
The two startups have combined two of their products in a single 20-foot container. Osmosun is an autonomous solar-powered desalination solution, while Mobil-Watt is a solar container that can be easily deployed in less than two hours.
The companies said the fully equipped container can be rapidly deployed in health, military or natural disaster situations, as it does not require any civil engineering expertise to set up. The reverse osmosis unit can produce up to 100 cubic meters of drinking water per day, which equals the basic needs of 5,000 people, based on the minimum consumption levels recommended by the World Health Organization of 20 liters per day.
The container's solar power system offers complete autonomy from external energy sources such as diesel power generators or grid electricity. It can also hybridize energy sources to produce electricity when the sun is not shining.
The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission recently said that PV is set to become the most cost-competitive way to power desalination. The study found that PV will remain the most economical option up to 2030.

The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill in September seeking to block imports of goods made in Xinjiang province, China due to forced labor concerns. Xinjiang is a major producer of fossil fuel, and supplies around 20% of the world’s cotton, as well as more than 40% of the world’s solar grade polysilicon. The U.S. government has issued orders barring imports of cotton from the region. According to the bills, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection would be required to treat all goods made in whole or in part within Xinjiang as presumptively banned from entry into the United States within 120 days of the law’s enactment.
China’s polysilicon capacity will come in at 452,000 metric tons (MT) at the end of 2020. Of this, 237,000 MT – 52.4% of the total in China and 41.7% of the global polysilicon market – is located in China’s Xinjiang region.
The polysilicon production capacities of Daqo New Energy (75,000 MT), TBEA (72,000 MT), and East Hope (50,000 MT, plus 100,000 MT planned) are located entirely in Xinjiang, as well as 46.5% of GCL-Poly’s 86,000 MT total capacity.
China’s mono-Si Ingot capacity reached 182 GW at the end of 2020, but Xinjiang houses less than 20 GW of the ingot capacity. The few lines of cell and module production that remain in the region have been halted already. It is worth noting that two manufacturers with capacity in Xinjiang are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Daqo plans to raise CNY 5 billion ($773.9 million) for a high-purity semiconductor project with 1,000 MT of annual capacity, and a 35,000 MT solar-grade polysilicon project. It may postpone or build them outside of Xinjiang.
A 42% chunk of JinkoSolar’s 8 GW ingot pulling capacity is in Xinjiang. It had planned to expand this to 14 GW, but may instead add ingot pulling capacity to its Leshan and Xining-based facilities.
In recent years Chinese producers have expanded into parts of western China such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, and Yunnan, where electricity is cheaper, leading to increased concentration of polysilicon capacity.
Yongxiang, Daqo, and GCL-Poly will each ramp up more than 100,000 MT between 2021 and 2022. Others may expand after 2023. Chinese polysilicon producers’ cost advantage will allow them to edge out foreign rivals. The volume of polysilicon imported into China could fall very low as early as 2023.

The United States urged Europe to follow suit after its ban on imports of certain goods from Xinjiang. Considering that Europe has imposed trade barriers against other industries before, polysilicon demand is estimated in three scenarios: U.S. demand alone, demand from the United States and Europe combined, and that all non-China customers stop using Xinjiang-produced polysilicon. The estimate suggests that even if the U.S. government and the European Union impose new sanctions, polysilicon capacity in non-Xinjiang regions is enough to fulfil module demand from these two regions.
Under the worst-case scenario, in which overseas markets no longer use Xinjiang-produced polysilicon, non-Xinjiang polysilicon capacity will fall short of module demand. However, it appears unlikely that all overseas markets will stop using products that contain materials from Xinjiang.
Since Europe and the United States would prefer polysilicon produced outside of Xinjiang, manufacturers may have to move production lines to other provinces, unless they can provide credible evidence that they have no part in forced labor practices.
Vertically integrated companies are negotiating contracts with non-Xinjiang polysilicon suppliers in anticipation of bans. Considering that it is highly complex to verify certificates of origin, wafer makers and vertically integrated companies may opt to source polysilicon from non-Xinjiang regions.
This has pushed manufacturers to sign long-term contracts to ensure a certain ratio of non-Xinjiang-produced polysilicon. This year more than 70% of the world’s polysilicon has been booked, and the share of long-term contracts may increase. This trend also prompts big manufacturers to form partnerships, such as the project signed by Tongwei and Trina.
PV InfoLink says mono-grade and multi-grade polysilicon prices will respectively reach CNY 65/kg and CNY 38/kg at the end of 2021. Factoring in labor concerns and trace of origin, suppliers outside of Xinjiang will have an advantage in sales.
Based on the mono-grade polysilicon price of CNY 70/kg, the estimated module price is CNY 1.5/W. As capacity will have grown significantly across the supply chain in the second half of 2021, the market situation may experience a transition period after the June 30 installation rush, sending module prices slowly downward. By then, unsubsidized projects are likely to get off the ground. Large module manufacturers are expected to initiate price wars, forcing wafer, cell, and even polysilicon manufacturers to react promptly.

A long-abandoned landfill site, located 8 miles south of downtown Houston, will soon become the largest urban solar farm in the United States.
The 240-acre plot of land, located in Houston’s Sunnyside neighborhood, has been approved for lease to a Wolfe Energy subsidiary by Mayor Sylvester Turner and the city council. Each acre will be leased for $1.00/year.
The Sunnyside Solar Project will feature 50 MW of capacity once it reaches operation, which is currently anticipated for the end of 2022. Turner’s office has indicated that a portion of the project will be set aside to serve as a community solar installation, although it is not clear how much capacity will be dedicated to community solar.
The city of Houston is also touting Sunnyside as the nation’s largest brownfield solar installation. “Brownfield” refers to projects developed on environmentally contaminated land. Because of this contamination, the project’s developers, Sunnyside Energy LLC, will be required to complete site remediation before construction can begin.
Sunnyside Energy is a partnership among EDF Renewables, MP2 Energy, and Wolfe Energy. The companies will supply electricity to the Houston-area power grid through MP2 Energy and CenterPoint, meaning that the solar-generated power would be distributed across the metropolitan region.

Back in February 2020, the traditional coal and gas hub of Gladstone, Queensland, put its hand up to become Australia’s hydrogen mecca. The city was selected to host two ambitious projects – a gigawatt-scale green hydrogen-ammonia installation and a gas injection facility – in order to blend green hydrogen into the city’s natural gas network. 
This week, Japan's Sumitomo announced that it has signed a front-end engineering and design contract with JGC Holdings Corp. for a solar-powered green hydrogen production plant in Gladstone. The plant will produce 250-300 tons of hydrogen per year, and could scale up in the future.
It is perhaps not surprising that Sumitomo is turning to green hydrogen, considering the company’s stunning US$250 million loss on its Western Australian Bluewaters coal-fired power station. The loss ensured that 2020 was the company’s worst-ever annual performance. 
The 434 MW Bluewaters coal-fired power station is Western Australia’s newest coal power station, completed in 2009 and generates approximately 15% of the state’s energy. Interestingly, it is the state's only privately owned coal-fired power station. According to a report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), the rapidly accelerating transition to renewables has ensured that Sumitomo is now left holding a stranded asset. 
“(We are) making extensive efforts to expand the use of hydrogen energy, which is expected to be an energy source that does not emit CO2, when burned, and ammonia, which is expected to be one of the most promising hydrogen energy carriers in hydrogen transportation, where there are issues from an economic and safety perspective,” said JSC Group. “In addition, we are proposing a hydrogen production system that will produce hydrogen from synthetic gas made from waste plastics, in order to continue to contribute to the realization of a hydrogen society in Japan and abroad.” 
Competition from Oman
On the same day that Sumitomo announced its plans in Gladstone, it also announced the commencement of a feasibility study on a gray-green hydrogen hybrid project in Oman. 
Sumitomo previously had a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with major Omani oil and gas producer, ARA Petroleum LLC (ARA), and now discussions on the project have commenced with this feasibility study. 
Using natural gas to produce gray hydrogen, ARA hopes to commence operations in 2023, with plans to produce 300-400 tons of gray hydrogen annually. The hybrid nature of the project comes with the addition of a 20 MW solar installation to power the site and hydrogen production facilities. 
Ad van Wijk, a professor of future energy systems at TU Delft in the Netherlands, told pv magazine that Oman has great hydrogen prospects. “Very good solar resources … they have the industry … that’s the interesting thing, due to the gas and other fossil fuel industries the harbour facilities may not be in place for hydrogen as such, but for ammonia they are in place … they make the hydrogen from natural gas and then make ammonia and ship it,” said Wijk. 
Oman already has the industry to service this hydrogen production plant then. At the outset, hydrogen industry has a lot in common with the fossil fuel industry.
“Of course, in a certain sense that (fossil fuel industry) is the enemy,” continued Wijk. “But you could also say this is a lucky circumstance because we don’t have to develop a hydrogen industry from scratch. For example, the solar PV industry had to be developed from scratch because it was not there, but that is not the case with the total supply chain for hydrogen.” 
Oman, like Saudi Arabia, will look to provide Australia with stiff competition in the hydrogen economy throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Initially, said Wijk, gray and blue hydrogen will be able to supply the market more easily and cheaply than green hydrogen, however this advantage will probably only last a few years. Eventually, solar and wind will be so cheap that they will beat fossil fuels.
