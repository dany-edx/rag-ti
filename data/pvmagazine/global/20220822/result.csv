Larsen & Toubro has commissioned 380 kW of an 800 kW green hydrogen plant at its AM Naik Heavy Engineering Complex in Hazira, in the Indian state of Gujarat.
The Indian multinational said the green hydrogen plant, which is spread across 3,000 square meters, will produce 45 kilograms of green hydrogen per day for self-consumption by its Hazira manufacturing complex. It said the operational 380 kW capacity uses an alkaline electrolysis process. The remaining 420 kW capacity will be based on PEM electrolysis technology. 
“The green hydrogen plant is designed for an electrolyzer capacity of 800 kW comprising both alkaline (380 kW) and PEM (420 kW) technologies,” said Larsen & Toubro. “It will be powered by a rooftop solar plant of 990 kW peak DC capacity and a 500kWh battery energy storage system. The 420 kW PEM electrolyzer, along with solar plant capacity augmentation to 1.6 MW peak DC, will be part of future expansion.” 
Larsen & Toubro set up the green hydrogen generation plant and integrated it with the existing manufacturing facilities to use the high-purity green hydrogen (99.99%) and oxygen that is produced. The manufacturing facility will use a blend of 15% hydrogen with natural gas as a fuel. Oxygen will supplement the existing usage in cutting and welding applications. 
The plant design incorporates both active and passive safety systems to ensure safe operation and production. It will be operated through control systems with remote monitoring functionality, the company said. In addition, an integrated data analytics platform designed by Larsen & Toubro will provide insight into the performance of the electrolyzers and the overall plant.
Larsen & Toubro said it aims to play a significant role in accelerating the ecosystem around green hydrogen, with its thrust in both the EPC and build-own-operate models, coupled with the backward integration of manufacturing electrolyzers and grid battery energy storage systems.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/22/the-mobility-revolution-new-tech-reduces-risk-of-electrocution-from-electric-cars/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"AUGUST 22, 2022",The mobility rEVolution: New tech cuts risk of electrocution from EVs,"University of York researchers have developed a new technology that has proven successful in reducing the risk of electrocution with electric vehicles in major road accidents. Presently, the main safety issue in EVs is the high voltage of the DC ‘bus’ – electrical conductors that store power at high voltage and distribute power to other circuits in the car. To reduce power surges during a collision, a circuit breaker is installed to interrupt the connection between the battery and boost converters, which would normally act to lift the voltage to high levels. But while the circuit breaker will prevent power surges, it does not reduce the voltage stored in the DC bus. “The bus voltage in most electric car models is 400 V, which is much higher than the voltage in our home systems at 230 V, as well as industry levels at 380 V,” said Yihua Hu, from the University of York’s School of Physics, Engineering, and Technology. “To significantly reduce the risk of a fatal electric shock in the case of a car crash, we need the voltage to be 60 V or less and to reduce to that level in under five seconds.” New research in IEE Transactions of Power Electronics involved designing a hybrid model of the DC bus that used both the internal mechanisms of the car and the external pathways that allow safe passage of energy. The team developed a system that in the case of circuity damage, would consume any remaining voltage so energy does not build up, increasing the risk of electrocution. The team also devised an energy discharge algorithm that would mean that even in the event of an electrical failure, the DC bus would still be able to reduce the voltage output and protect other circuitry in the vehicle. The technology has now been trialed in a car powertrain testing system and the team showed that voltage is reduced to 60 V in under five seconds in the event of damage to circuits.
Duke Energy said it will explore the vehicle-to-grid capabilities of Ford F-150 Lightning all-electric trucks to learn how they can serve as a grid resource in Florida. The US utility will launch an R&D pilot program in the state to evaluate the viability of the new truck's high-capacity batteries, which serve as backup power supply for homes and small businesses for up to 10 days during a power outage. It will add approximately five Ford F-150 Lightning trucks to its Florida fleet and perform additional testing of the tech, with a focus on homes that have solar and storage. The pilot will focus on real-world use cases with the Ford F-150 Lightning to benefit the grid, such as how the vehicles interact with other customer-owned distributed energy resources, how the batteries power homes during outages, how the vehicles will be used to feed the grid during peak periods, and how such usage might affect the batteries over time.
Geely said it plans to boost the sale of EVs and exports in the wake of pandemic lockdowns and supply-chain hiccups. Shipments of EVs will account for more than 30% of overall sales by the end of 2022 and will continue the upward trend in 2023, Geely CEO Gan Jiayue said. The Chinese automaker will also work to bolster exports to Europe, Middle East, Asia Pacific and Latin America, he added. The company’s export sales volume increased by 64%, but it posted lower-than-expected profit for the first half of the year. It delivered 613,842 vehicles in the first half – just more than one-third of its annual target of 1.65 million. “The group’s sales performance in the first half of 2022 was below management’s expectations, primarily attributable to the disruption to production and sales caused by the pandemic prevention and controls in some cities in China and global shortage of chips,” said the company.
IHS Markit has published a new white paper predicting that the market share of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) among EU passenger cars will increase from 9.8% in 2021 to 67.9% in 2030. This will result in a yearly capacity of 592 GWh battery demand, from just 56 GWh in 2021. The EU passenger vehicle market for lithium-ion batteries is expected to reach nearly 3,000 GWh by 2030. However, battery raw material prices will peak in 2022 and then decline from 2023 to 2024. Nickel prices will continue to see significant volatility before easing in 2021, while lithium spot price movements will stay inflated over the short term due to logistical challenges in China. “The tight supply and demand balance is likely to remain in the future, but the current spot prices are at their very peak and they are expected to ease out from such high levels,” said the research firm. It expects the NCM811 battery chemistry to dominate the EU passenger vehicle market in 2030.
CareEdge said in a new report that EV demand in India over the next three years will grow more slowly than previously estimated. It expects domestic EV sales volume to grow moderately at 75% per year over the next three years. “The large-scale transition to EVs across various categories, which was earlier expected to happen post-2023, is likely to be delayed by at least three years. Two-wheeler EVs will continue to account for over 90% of demand in the interim [given their cost parity with ICE vehicles in this segment],” said the research firm. The analysts said that the switchover to EVs in the car segment will continue to be hampered by relatively high car prices, as well as the lack of charging infrastructure across India. EV demand will suffer due to higher prices of key battery raw materials, including nickel, lithium, and cobalt, arising from supply constraints, they said.
Volkswagen and Mahindra & Mahindra have announced plans to expand their business relationship and help India’s auto market transition to electric vehicles. The companies signed a term sheet regarding the supply of MEB electric components for Mahindra’s new INGLO electric platform, which builds on a partnering agreement from earlier this year. The cooperation intends to have a volume of more than 1 million units over lifetime and includes the equipment of five all-electric SUVs with MEB components. The two companies will also explore opportunities for collaboration, hinting at a broader strategic partnership to speed up the electrification of India’s automobile industry.
The Australian government will seek to introduce fuel-efficiency standards to help push more EVs into the domestic market and improve their affordability. EVs now account for just 2% of new cars sales in Australia – a rate nearly five times lower than the global average. Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen said expanding Australia’s EV market and improving fuel-efficiency standards will be the focus of a new national electric vehicle strategy. Bowen said a discussion paper on it will be released for consultation in September. The government will also look to set a low-emissions vehicle target for the commonwealth fleet of 75% of new leases and purchases by 2025, in a bid to encourage more EV model introductions and to expand the resale market.
Bank of Australia is looking to ditch fossil fuel car loans from 2025 to encourage more people to go electric. The bank’s chief impact officer, Sasha Courville, said the announcement would send a message that “if you’re considering buying a new car you should think seriously about an electric vehicle, both for its impact on the climate and for its lifetime cost savings.” Courville said the bank chose 2025 because the change to electric vehicles needs to happen quickly. “We believe it can with the right supporting policies in place to bring a greater range of more affordable electric vehicles to Australia,” she said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/22/controlling-the-crystals-for-a-17-96-efficient-perovskite-solar-cell/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,TAIWAN,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 22, 2022",Controlling the crystals for a 17.96% efficient perovskite solar cell,"A perovskite solar cell can only be as good as the materials that go into it, and of all the many approaches to improving their performance and stability, and developing processes to produce them at scale, those that focus on the precursor materials that go into the perovskite layer have received comparatively little attention.
A group of scientists led by the Industrial Technology and Research Institute in Taiwan worked on the fabrication of lead-iodide (PbI2), an element in virtually all of the best perovskite solar cells produced to date. They built on earlier research that has shown the purity and formation of this material could be a key factor in performance once it is integrated into a solar cell.
The group’s latest work demonstrates how the crystalline structure and orientation of PbI2 ultimately have a significant impact on cell performance. The researchers also introduce a simple way to control this using temperature during synthesis. They described their findings in “A novel method to control the crystallographic preferred orientation of lead iodide toward highly efficient and large-area perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in RRL Solar.
ITRI/Pei-Ting Chiu
By varying the temperature during synthesis of PbI2 the group noted significant changes in the way the crystals formed, and these had a major effect on the cell performance. “Horizontal planes … are beneficial for black FAPbI3 perovskite crystals while the lateral facets … lead to the formation of δ-FAPbI3 which is known as the yellow phase of perovskites and has no photo-activity,” the group explained.
And when fabricated into cells, PbI2 synthesized at higher temperatures (120 C) was the top performer, with the temperature causing more growth of the desired horizontal facets. Cells made with PbI2 synthesized at 25 C came out at just 8.8% average efficiency, while those with the material processed at 120 C reached an average efficiency of 17%, with a champion cell in the batch measured at 17.96%. And these cells were scaled up to an area of 3.68 square centimeters, achieving 16.08% efficiency, which the group sees as strong potential for its approach to be worth investigating for larger area devices.
“The industrialization of perovksite modules is inevitable,” the group concluded. “Providing reliable and cheap precursors is the key to fabricate PSCs as a competitive product in the solar cell market in the future.”

Neoen Australia said this week that its 400 MW solar farm, which forms part of its AUD 600 million ($414.6 million) Western Downs Green Power Hub, is nearing completion. Testing works are now underway in collaboration with Queensland transmission network operator Powerlink and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).
While final testing and commissioning activities are continuing, Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said in a statement that the project – which is being developed on a 1,500-hectare site near Chinchilla – has already begun generating into the national electricity market.
“A major milestone has been reached on Australia’s largest solar farm under construction with the project now able to export more than 100 MW of clean energy into the nation’s electricity grid,” the statement reads.
Upon completion, the Western Downs Green Power Hub will also include a 200 MW/400 MWh big battery. It is expected to produce more than 1,080 GWh of clean energy per year, or enough electricity to power more than 230,000 Queensland homes.
“This solar farm, the largest of its kind in Australia, will be able to generate power for a region the size of Logan and Redlands combined,” de Brenni said. “And is a major step toward achieving the government’s 50% renewable energy by 2030 target.”
Neoen Australia Managing Director Louis de Sambucy said the team is now working to finish the project as quickly as possible, and to ramp up the capacity in coordination with Powerlink and AEMO. When fully operational, the Western Downs Green Power Hub will add 400 MW of renewable energy into the grid.
CleanCo, a Queensland government-owned energy generator and retailer, is signed up to take 320 MW. CleanCo Chair Jacqui Walters said the power purchase agreement will be used to support commercial and industrial customers to push ahead with their net-zero goals and build their global competitiveness with competitively priced energy.
“CleanCo has committed to bringing 1,400 MW of new renewable energy into the market by 2025 and projects like the Western Downs Green Power Hub are underpinning that, so it’s very exciting to see the project coming to completion,” she said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/08/22/rooftop-pv-for-pre-cooling-of-residential-commercial-buildings/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 22, 2022","Rooftop PV for pre-cooling of residential, commercial buildings","Researchers in Australia have looked at how rooftop PV generation could be used to run air conditioners (AC) to pre-cool residential and commercial buildings.
The scientists defined the proposed concept as “solar pre-cooling.” It purportedly offers benefits in terms of mitigating low minimum demand in electricity networks, flattening the grid's net demand profile, and reducing electricity bills.
“Pre-cooling can be implemented in all kinds of buildings that have an AC unit. Solar pre-cooling in residential, commercial, and office buildings have been studied in the literature and proved to be practical,” researcher Gloria Pignatta told pv magazine.
The scientists considered the thermal mass of buildings as a virtual battery that could be used to shift or shave peak demand caused by AC systems.
“Pre-cooling means charging building thermal mass before peak demand onset by reducing thermal mass temperature and then discharging the coolness during the peak period,” the scientists explained. “This is typically done by reducing the thermostat setpoint a few hours before the expected peak period to force the AC to switch on.”
Pre-cooling can be performed with three thermal mass activation methods: surface activation, forced-air activation, and hydronic activation.
“Whether or not thermal mass activation results in energy cost reduction depends on the AC control strategy that defines the temperature setpoint trajectory or AC schedule,” the academics said.
The identified several factors that could help to reduce energy costs. They include reducing peak power, which is beneficial for commercial and office buildings with a demand charge component in their electricity bills, and shifting AC demand to off-peak hours with cheap electricity prices. Other factors include the reduction of mechanical cooling requirements by using night ventilation, and higher efficiency of air-conditioning units as they operates in lower ambient temperatures.
University of New South Wales (UNSW)
The researchers said pre-cooling can be more beneficial if the surplus PV generation during the day is used to pre-cool the building instead of importing electricity from the grid. This is because the feed-in tariff (FIT) paid for rooftop PV generation is lower than the retail electricity prices, and the future tariff structures might not have a FiT component for exporting to the grid.
“By using the surplus PV generation for solar pre-cooling, households use cheap or free electricity to pre-cool the building, which consequently reduces their imports from the grid during peak hours, when tariff rates are expensive,” Pignatta said. “Moreover, reducing the export of surplus PV to the grid increases levels of self-consumption, lowering PV’s contribution to low network minimum demand and reducing the operational challenges for managing the low minimum demand.”
Although pre-cooling and solar pre-cooling can be beneficial to the network, the potential cost savings and reduction in peak AC demand are not necessarily significant for all buildings, said the researchers. 
“The potential of pre-cooling and solar pre-cooling is based on a range of technical, economic, and behavioral factors such as the energy efficiency of a building, its construction materials, AC unit rated capacity, PV system rated capacity, occupants’ thermal comfort expectations and time-of-use consumption patterns are some of the factors that directly affect the pre-cooling/solar pre-cooling potential of a building,” they said. “A gap in the literature is the lack of thorough investigation in solar pre-cooling using actual monitored household data, including rooftop PV generation, appliance-level demand, and building thermal dynamics. Such studies can reveal the actual potential of solar pre-cooling with more value than simulation-based approaches.”
The researchers described their findings in “Demand response via pre-cooling and solar pre-cooling: a review,” which was recently published in Energy and Buildings.
“It is worth mentioning that the field of solar pre-cooling has the potential for further investigation in terms of cooling technology,” they concluded. “Grid-connected or stand-alone PV-integrated heat pumps, adsorption, absorption, and desiccant cooling systems driven by solar energy can supply cooling to pre-cool the building.”
The research group includes scientists from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia, as well as researchers from the Collaboration on Energy and Environmental Markets and the High-Performance Architecture research cluster.

TotalEnergies said the pilot facility will investigate the impact of solar panels on agricultural yield, as well as the biodiversity, carbon storage, and water quality of the site. The agrivoltaic system relies on bifacial solar modules and vertical mounting systems provided by unnamed manufacturers.
“This demonstrator symbolizes our approach to agrivoltaic projects! We are convinced that the synergies developed between the production of green electricity, biogas and agriculture are one of the answers to guarantee our energy independence and our food independence,” said Thierry Muller, managing director of TotalEnergies Renouvelables France.
In October 2021, TotalEnergies switched on its first 240 kW agrivoltaic demonstrator plant in Channay, northeastern France. The project was developed with the support of German startup Next2Sun Mounting Systems, with which signed an exclusive partnership agreement with TotalEnergies in March 2020.
According to a recent German study, vertical installations could have a beneficial effect in stabilizing the country's grid, while allowing greater integration with agricultural activities than with conventional ground-mounted PV plants. The scientists found that vertical PV systems could shift solar yield into hours of higher electricity demand and more electricity supply in the winter months, thus reducing solar curtailment.

ReNew Power has secured a $1 billion loan for a renewables project in India. The financing came from 12 international lenders, led by Rabobank. 
“As ReNew rapidly builds its total portfolio, this $1 billion loan has been tied up through a special purpose vehicle and will be deployed for its hybrid round-the-clock (RTC) battery-enabled project,” ReNew said. “The interest rate, after hedging, is expected to be lower than the company’s current average cost of debt on its balance sheet.”
ReNew Power is developing the 1.3 GW hybrid wind-solar energy project, which will be supplemented with up to 100 MWh of battery storage. The project will supply 400 MW of round-the-clock power to Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI). It will involve the development of wind and solar farms across the Indian states of Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra. 
“This loan – the single-largest project finance in India’s renewable sector – highlights the interest of global lenders in ReNew as it helps spearhead India’s historic clean energy shift and shows its continued ability to access financing at much lower rates than several years ago, despite the current volatility in the currency markets and a rising interest rate environment,” said Sumant Sinha, chairman and CEO of ReNew. 
Japan’s Mitsui owns a 49% stake in the ReNew Power project. Under the 25-year power purchase agreement, the project will supply electricity in the first year at a tariff of INR 2.90/kWh ($0.036). The tariff will increase by 3% per year over the first 15 years of the 25-year power supply deal, before becoming a fixed payment for the remaining period of the project.

“Our hybrid system can be implemented in any kind of building but the energy content of the gravity storage system increases with the height of the building, which means high buildings offer the largest potential for its development,” researcher Mayurakshi Mondal told pv magazine.
The hybrid system consists of a conventional rooftop PV system, a solar tree, two gravity power modules for building (GPMBs), and a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB), with the three storage systems being charged exclusively by the two solar installations. “The proposed system emphasizes on supplying the essential load demand of a building through renewable energy as much as possible, especially focusing on the reduction of the demand from the grid at peak hours,” the scientists explained. “The system is also focused to flatten the load demand curve of the grid.”
They estimated the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the redox flow battery at $0.424/kWh and that of the GPM at $0.148/kWh. Due to this difference, the battery is used only as a secondary storage system, the said. During the charging phase, the GPMBs work via a motor that drives a pump to push water from the top of a piston in a larger pipe into a smaller one. It then pushes it back to the larger pipe below the piston.
“This pushes the piston upward and the operation terminates when the piston reaches the topmost position of the larger pipe, thereby storing energy in the mechanical form,” the Indian group said, noting that both GPMBs should have a diameter of 1.5 meters each for the larger pipe.
In the discharging phase, the piston in the larger pipe comes down and pushes the water downward, into the smaller pipe. The water flows through the pump/turbine unit operating in the turbine mode and generates electricity with the electrical device operating in the generator mode, the academics said. “The discharging operation ends when the piston reaches the bottom-most point in the larger pipe.”
They considered a 110-meter building with 39 floors and a total floor area of 750 square meters. The two GPMBs have a storage capacity of 96.2 kWh each and the redox flow battery is able to store 300 kWh. The 75.4 kW PV system occupies a surface of 450 square meters, which corresponds to around 60% of the roof area, and five solar trees totaling 57.7 kW are installed in the exterior open-air space of the building.
“After meeting the residential load demand and charging both GPMBs, any extra generated energy is used to charge the VRFB. Thereafter, any remaining energy generated is sold to the grid,” they said.
In the proposed system configuration, two GPMBs only supply electricity within the peak hours 6 pm to 9 pm and 9 pm to 12 pm, in order to reduce the burden of peak hours over the grid.
“The proposed system is able to supply 47.77% of renewable energy to the building as a yearly average and is capable of injecting 48.89% renewable energy to the building along with grid,” the researchers said.
They described the hybrid system in “Solar PV driven hybrid gravity power module—Vanadium redox flow battery energy storage for an energy efficient multi-storied building,” which was recently published in the International Journal of Energy Research.
“Further studies on GPMB are required before practical implementation, like the effect of high starting current devices such as an air-conditioner, water pump and so on over its operation,” the scientists said. “The system also requires a cost optimization analysis.”

The storage systems have a combined capacity of 720 MW and a maximum storage capacity of 1,316 MWh. This compares to 977 MWh of distributed storage capacity at the end of March and 189.5 MW/295.6 MWh at the end of 2020.
The newly installed capacity for the second quarter of this year was 170 MW/360 MWh, which represents the strongest three-month period ever recorded in the country for storage deployment. According to the new figures, most of the devices – 12,425, for a total capacity of 710 MW/1,340 MWh – are based on lithium-ion technologies, with the remaining share represented by lead batteries and other technologies.
Most of the storage systems have been deployed in the region of Lombardy, with a combined capacity of 52 MW/114 MWh. The regional government is implementing a multi-year rebate scheme for residential and commercial storage systems coupled with PV.
Italy's National Integrated Plan for Climate and Energy aims for 50GW of solar by 2030.
