The researchers have also proposed a fabrication procedure, an experimental setup, and a process to measure solar-to-hydrogen efficiency.
University of Malaya researchers and University of the Punjab scientists have jointly investigated the feasibility of hydrogen as a primary combustion fuel for municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration, by designing a vertical shaft-type incinerator that can operate on pure hydrogen. “The hydrogen-based incinerator exhibited the highest performance for homogenous paper and food waste (1 kg) with 60% and 87% moisture content, respectively,” the team wrote in “Hydrogen as potential fuel for solid waste incineration for a sustainable waste management,” which was recently published in Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Access. They fed a pre-mixed hydrogen and oxygen fuel through burners to achieve homogenous heat distribution, with tests on different MSWs, and moisture percentages from 60% and 90%. The maximum recorded temperature of the incineration was 850 C. They said an increase in moisture content of the waste could reduce the performance of the hydrogen-based incineration system.
The European Commission has launched its third call for large-scale projects under the EU Innovation Fund with a budget of €3 billion ($2.9 billion), thanks to increased revenue from auctioning EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) allowances.

SNCF Energie, a unit of French railway operator SNCF, has agreed to buy 207 GWh of annual electricity supplies under a 25-year power purchase agreement from French independent power producer Reden, which is part of Australia's Macquarie Asset Management. It is the largest PPA ever signed by a French railway company.
“With this record contract, we are taking concrete action to strengthen the stability of our supply and our share of electricity from renewable sources,” SNCF said in a statement.
Reden will supply the electricity from four solar power plants it is now building in France. They include a 36 MW facility in Haute-Garonne, a 21 MW plant in Aude, and two plants in Gironde with capacities of 77 MW and 12 MW. The solar parks will be commissioned between 2024 and 2025 and all of the electricity will be sold to SNCF Energie.
SNCF Energie has been piloting a “corporate PPA” program since 2018. It has already signed eight PPAs, including one with French energy giant EDF and one with Switzerland's Axpo.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/04/inverted-perovskite-solar-cell-with-21-85-efficiency-via-surface-modulator/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 4, 2022",Inverted perovskite solar cell with 21.85% efficiency via surface modulator,"Researchers from the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom have fabricated an inverted perovskite solar cell by using a surface modulator that reportedly facilitates superior passivation on perovskite surfaces, increasing overall cell efficiency. As the surface modulator, the scientists tested two organic halide salts known as 4-hydroxyphenethylammonium iodide (HO-PEAI), and 2-thiopheneethylammonium iodide (2-TEAI).
“These modulators can affect the surface energy of the perovskite films,” they explained.
They noted that the two compounds can dramatically reduce non-radiative interfacial recombination. This can have a significant impact on electrical performance in perovskite cells, with implications for open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, fill factor, and ultimately, power conversion efficiency. They reported that “2-TEAI showed a stronger interaction than HO-PEAI, forming a quasi-2D structure on the perovskite surface without further annealing.”
The scientists built the p-i-n structured cell with poly-TPD coated indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a hole transport layer made of carbazole (2PACz), the perovskite layer, the 2-TEAI modulator, an electron acceptor made of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact. The salts were deposited onto the surface of perovskite films through a facile spin-coating process without annealing.
Through different measurements, the research team ascertained that the surface modulator does not alter the absorption spectra of perovskite films.
“The 2-TEAI induces a deeper valence band edge, which is expected to provide a stronger hole-blocking effect at the perovskite/PCBM interface and thus is more beneficial for reducing the interfacial recombination,” the group said. “Based on these results, we believe the 2-TEAI would enhance the open-circuit voltage of manufactured perovskite solar cells.”
The solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 21.85%, which the scientists described as the highest reported efficiency for inverted perovskite solar cells that use 2PACz as the hole transport layer. The device also achieved an open-circuit voltage of 1.2 V, a short-circuit current of 21.93 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 0.83. For comparison, a reference perovskite solar cell without the modulator achieved an efficiency of 19.95 and was able to retain only 53% of the initial efficiency after 180 minutes.
“The findings suggest that the role of the modulator is more than surface passivation,” the scientists concluded. “Our study will provide insight into the selection and molecular design of post-treatment materials for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.”
They described the cell design in “Suppressing Interfacial Recombination with a Strong-Interaction Surface Modulator for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.

The Chinese inverter manufacturer said the 3.3 kW inverters might be the “smallest” in the world.
“Due to the exceptional design dimensions, the inverter is extremely light in weight. The net weight of the whole machine is only 5.4 kg, which is lighter than the majority of inverters in the market,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “It can be easily handled with one hand, which makes it convenient to carry and install.”
The company offers seven versions of the transformerless devices, with nominal power ranging from 0.7 kW to 3.3 kW. Their efficiency ratings range from 97.2% to 97.4%, with a European efficiency ratings of 96.5% to 96.8%.
The maximum input voltage is 500 V and the MPPT voltage range is between 50 V and 480 V. The inverters also feature IP65-rated protection and have cooling systems based on natural convection.
“The inverter features high energy density, high input current, low starting voltage, and wide voltage range which make it the ideal match for the market's PV modules. The S-G2 inverter has a wide range of usage settings, making it suitable for a variety of smaller household projects,” said the spokesperson.
The inverters offer 60 V startup voltage, which reportedly ensures longer work times and optimal PV utilization.

The deal will see Huawei set up 2 GW of rooftop solar capacity in total. All of the factories are owned by BGMEA members.
Combined, the rooftop systems will generate around 2,600 GWh of green electricity per year upon completion. The BGMEA will regulate the process and serve as a communicative bridge between Huawei and the factory owners. 
“Energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon footprint reduction have been one of the core areas of concern for BGMEA to facilitate sustainable growth and maintain competitiveness of the industry in the long run,” said Faruque Hassan, the president of the BGMEA.
Pan Junfeng, the chief executive of Huawei Technologies (Bangladesh), said demand for electricity is rising in the Bangladeshi apparel sector.
“Huawei will work with BGMEA to fulfill the necessity of more power supply through green solutions (solar power),” said Pan, adding that this will help to reduce excess power supply pressure on the national grid.
Bangladesh has the highest number of “green factories” in the world, according to the US Green Building Council. It says that around 500 more apparel factories in the country are now waiting for certification.
Bangladesh currently has the capacity to generate 948 MW of electricity from renewables. The nation now faces a serious electricity crisis, as many power plants remain shut down due to shortages of imported oil and gas.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/11/04/pv-powered-thermoelectric-cooling-for-air-conditioning-in-buildings/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 4, 2022",PV-powered thermoelectric cooling for air conditioning in buildings,"An Australian-Indian research group has looked at how thermoelectric modules (TEMs) and PV could be combined to provide heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) in buildings.
Thermoelectric modules are widely used for the electronic cooling of devices such as personal computer processors, portable food, and beverage storage systems.
“Thermoelectric cooling can be cheaper to operate than many conventional HVAC type systems for small area cooling applications especially if we are coupling it with photovoltaic electricity which is cheaper than conventional electricity for many regions of the world,” researcher Shyam Singh Chandel told pv magazine.
The researchers said that conventional TEMs have only rarely been used in actual buildings due to their low coefficient of performance (COP). The combination with PV, however, could bring them closer to commercial viability in the construction sector, especially if they are used in low-energy-demand buildings, which still rely on conventional air conditioning.
“In the current state of the art, a prototype thermoelectric cooling system may not be cheaper as far as upfront cost is concerned but will provide many advantages like zero or low maintenance, easy repair, zero-noise operation, modularity, precision cooling and is certainly more environmentally friendly than chlorofluorocarbons-based cooling systems which affect the environment due to fugitive emissions, especially during manufacturing and disposal of such systems,” said Chandel.
The scientists developed a novel design for a TEM system powered by building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). The system uses air as the thermal fluid for rooftop PV and a primary TEM wall for room air conditioning.
“The TEM wall system is integrated with thermal energy storage material wall and has the primary function to heat or cool the adjacent room, store excess thermal energy and can also be optimized as a support system to enhance the efficiency of any already installed conventional AC system,” they said. “In the rooftop system, the airflow is sucked by natural convection from the bottom of the air-duct below the PV modules and takes the heat away from the integrated TEM as well as the PV modules.”
With semi-transparent solar modules, the system could be configured as a transparent thermoelectric module wall (TTEM-wall) or semi-transparent thermoelectric module wall (STEM-wall), depending upon the transmittance of the thermal mass. Chandel said the main challenge for the system is its lower efficiency compared to conventional vapor compression refrigeration (VCR) systems. Thermoelectric systems have a coefficient of performance (COP) typically in the range of 0.5 to 3.0, whereas it is 1.2 to 6.0 for VCR systems.
“However, if we look at building cooling requirements and thermal comfort temperature range, there is not always a need for high power cooling and, in such cases, the thermoelectric system can perform adequately even with lower cooling power and for the desired temperature change,” Chandel explained. “Coupling such systems with cheap PV electricity, and optimized design with the help of other technologies like radiant sky cooling panels, phase change materials (PCM) and heat pipes can also even out the field for feasible application of such systems in building applications. Furthermore, new research breakthrough in materials for thermoelectric modules is needed which can further make the technology really competitive with conventional HVAC systems.”
The scientists presented their findings in “Prospects of sustainable photovoltaic powered thermoelectric cooling in zero energy buildings: A review,” which was recently published in the International Journal of Energy Research. The research group includes academics from Shoolini University in India and the University of New South Wales in Australia.
“The novelty of the study is that it presents an updated comprehensive review of the past studies, current state of the art and future development research outcome and analysis in view of global climate change and need for sustainable zero-energy-building (ZEB) technologies,” they said.

The new electrode materials feature redox-active organic molecules, which release and store energy. The polymer particles are dissolved and mixed with carbon additives to make battery electrodes.
“We have developed new polymer electrode materials that combine solution-processability, redox activity, and sub-nanometer pores,” said researcher Anqi Wang. “Our molecular design approach is a synergistic combination of organic electrode materials and porous polymers developed in recent decades.”
The polymer electrode materials possess intrinsic sub-nanometer pores that enable fast Li-ion transport during battery operation. The generation of these sub-nanopores is a direct consequence of their unique macromolecular chain structures that are highly rigid and awkwardly shaped.
The other unique property of these polymers is their solution processability, which means they can be dissolved into an organic solvent and then processed into any forms and shapes as a composite or a stand-alone material. This adds greater versatility and simplicity to their use as battery electrodes.
“The solution processing technique is suitable for integration with the existing battery electrode manufacturing processes already used in industry at large scale,” said researcher Rui Tan.
The new method also leads to significantly better mixing and contact between polymers and carbon additives, including carbon nanotubes. The researchers said such control over interfaces could promote homogeneous current distribution within the electrode, which is something that has been difficult to achieve in conventional electrode materials.
The scientists described their results in “Solution-processable redox-active polymers of intrinsic microporosity for electrochemical energy storage” which was recently published in ACS Publications. They noted that the battery electrodes demonstrated stable cycling performance without any apparent capacity decay over more than a thousand cycles of charging and discharging.

The share of renewables in the country's electricity generation mix could hit 85% by 2050, from around 12% in 2011, said IRENA.
Solar is expected to become the backbone of this transformation, accounting for 798 GW of the total 1,000 GW under the “least ambitious” scenario. PV accounts for up to 840 GW under the “most ambitious” scenario. For that, Indonesia will need to add 66 GW of new solar capacity to its generation mix by 2030.
To achieve this goal, the nation would need to invest $44 billion in solar. Investment in other renewable technologies would amount to $39 billion, with an additional investment of $75 billion on grid infrastructure also being required. Battery storage would need a $5.5 billion investment and EV charging infrastructure would need $22 billion.
Indonesia’s own expectations are still far off from IRENA’s scenarios, however. The country’s 2021-30 electricity plan, released last year, set a renewables target of 23% by 2030, under its “optimum” scenario.  The country currently has around 190 MW of installed solar capacity, according to Apricum.
In May, Saudi Arabian developer ACWA Power won a bid to develop 110 MW of floating solar in water reservoirs, 50 MW on the island of Sumatra, and 60 MW on Java.
In April, Singapore-based Quantum Power Asia and Germany's ib vogt announced plans to invest $5 billion in a 3.5 GW solar and 12 GW storage project.
In January alone, Indonesia installed 51.2 MW of rooftop solar PV capacity, including commercial and industrial (C&I) and residential projects, according to data from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.

SECI has opened bidding to develop 1.2 GW of hybrid wind-solar power projects in India, paired with energy storage. The projects will be installed on a “build-own-operate” basis and will be connected to the interstate transmission network. The minimum bid capacity will be 50 MW.
SECI will sign a 25-year power purchase agreement with hybrid power developers at the tariffs discovered after the e-reverse auction.
“Identification of land, installation, and ownership of the project, along with obtaining connectivity necessary approvals and interconnection with the ISTS network for supply of power to SECI, will be under the scope of the hybrid power developer,” said SECI in the tender document.
For an installation to qualify as a hybrid project, the rated capacities of the solar and wind components must be a minimum of 33% of the total contracted capacity. For example, if the contracted capacity of a project is 100 MW, the rated capacities of both the wind and solar components must be a minimum of 33 MW each.
In addition, the winning developers will be expected to install at least 100 MWh of energy storage system capacity for every 100 MW project that is contracted under a PPA. The energy storage component must be co-located with the PV or the wind components of each project.

The 70 MW renewable energy baseload contract will supply BHP with 24/7 renewable energy from Neoen’s Goyder South Stage 1 wind farm and Blyth Battery from July 2025.
BHP’s Olympic Dam site, 650 kilometers north of Adelaide, is one of the world’s most significant deposits of gold, uranium, and copper. Copper is an increasingly important material in the renewable energy supply chain, and BHP Olympic Dam's asset president, Jennifer Purdie, said the mining giant is focused on producing
“South Australia’s high-quality copper to build renewable technologies and infrastructure … more sustainably,” said Purdie.
A baseload contract means continuous power supply, regardless of whether the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. Such contracts in the power purchase agreement space are increasingly common, especially in Nordic states with extensive wind generation portfolios, but the market is also strong in Spain and the United States.
However, the trend is only just beginning in Australia, and utility-scale battery systems are the reason. Neoen said it will deliver a “24/7 green energy solution to the mine, along with the associated large-scale certificates (LGCs).” And it will do this by firming the intermittent wind resources of its 412 MW Goyder South Stage 1 wind farm with storage capacity from its Blyth Battery.
The Blyth Battery received approval this year for up to 300 MW/800 MWh of storage capacity. In August 2022, Neoen announced storage revenues had grown by more than one-third in the last year due to its Australian battery assets – specifically its Victorian Big Battery.
Neoen said this contract is a demonstration that its portfolio of renewable energy and storage assets means it can now offer, “for the first time, firm delivery of green power.” Louis de Sambucy, Neoen Australia’s managing director, said that the company is convinced of its ability to “combine [its] assets and [its] energy management capabilities to create bespoke commercial offers.”
The company’s chairman, Xavier Barbaro, concurred.
“This first baseload PPA is a significant step forward for Neoen and will serve as a template for future contracts, opening up great market opportunities in Australia and in the rest of the world,” said Barbaro.
The Goyder Renewables Zone, of which Goyder South Stage 1 is an under-construction hybrid wind, solar and storage project. It has approval for 1,200 MW of wind, 600 MW of solar generation and 900 MW of battery storage capacity. Construction began on Aug. 25, 2022, and is expected to be operational in 2024.
This is not the first PPA agreement BHP has signed. In 2021, it signed a PPA with Risen Energy for its Nickel West Kwinana refinery in Western Australia. However, the deal was not a baseload contract.

With just under 1.9 GW of utility-scale solar installed in the third quarter of 2022, the industry experienced its slowest quarter since July-September 2020. This was expected to be a landmark year for solar, but global supply challenges have hampered growth, delayed projects, and driven up prices.  
Despite this, optimism remains. The American Clean Power Association (ACP) said in its quarterly report that the United States might deploy 550 GW of renewable energy by 2030. Solar is expected to lead the charge in this decade of energy transition, representing 59% of active renewable energy projects in queues. Along the way, the United States is expected to cut economy-wide emissions by 40% below 2005 levels. This progress will be accomplished by a clean power workforce of 1 million, said ACP.
“President (Joe) Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law on Aug. 16. This unprecedented national commitment to clean power is the largest policy investment in clean energy on record,” said the report. “The IRA is set to catalyze clean energy growth, ultimately more than tripling annual installations of wind, solar, and battery storage by the end of the decade.”
Despite a slow quarter, 2022 remains the second highest year for solar deployment in history, falling just behind 2021 totals. Quarterly installs were down 23% compared to the same period next year. This slowdown may persist for some time as solar module supply issues remain, and the United States works to inject Inflation Reduction Act funds into a new domestic manufacturing supply chain.
In total, solar installations in 2022 reach just over 7 GW. This brings total utility-scale solar operating capacity to 68 GW. Developers activated 41 solar projects, spanning 18 states and totaling 1.87 GW, said the ACP. California leads in cumulative installed operating capacity with 16.8 GW active, followed by Texas with 9.9 GW. Iowa increased its solar capacity by nearly 40% this quarter by installing 100 MW.
The largest utility-scale solar project commissioned this quarter was Old 300 Solar, a 430 MW facility in Texas. Developed by Ørsted, the project is selling its capacity to Microsoft via a power purchase agreement.
