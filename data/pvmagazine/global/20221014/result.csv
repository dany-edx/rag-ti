The Chinese-Canadian module manufacturer announced its IPO plans in June 2021, with China International Investment Corp. (CICC) as its listing sponsor.
GCL Technology said this week that its board has approved a proposal to move away from the Hong Kong Stock Exchanges to the mainland Chinese stock market, either in Shanghai or Shenzhen. It said that thus far, it has not submitted any official applications yet, as the proposal must be approved by shareholders.
Longi said its revenue for the first three quarters of this year likely ranged from CNY 86.4 billion ($12.14 billion) to CNY 87.4 billion. Net profit attributable to shareholders likely ranges from CNY 10.6 billion to CNY 11.2 billion. The company attributed its performance to higher silicon wafer and PV panel shipments.
Trina Solar has released its forecast for the first nine months of the year. It expects a net profit attributable to shareholders of CNY 2.03 billion to CNY 2.48 billion. It attributed its performance to rising PV module sales.
The original story was changed to show that Canadian Solar’s IPO has been suspended. It may resume its original listing plans if it can meet regulatory conditions.

The agency awarded 23.5 MW of solar capacity, at a price of BRL 0.176 ($0.033)/kWh.
Contracts for solar and wind were closed for a 15-year duration, with supply starting in 2027. The two sources were grouped in the auction, with a ceiling price of BRL 0.28/kWh. Wind contracted 51.8 MW, at BRL 0.171/kWh on average.
Only two distributors contracted energy in the auction – Cemig and Celpa.
In the last auction in which solar projects participated, the A-4 held in May, an average of 39.8 MW was sold at an average price of BRL 0.178/kWh, with the maximum at BRL 0.225/kWh.
In August, the Ministry of Mines and Energy canceled the A-6 auction, which would have contracted energy from 2028, citing a lack of demand from energy distributors. It would have have been held jointly with the A-5 auction. Prior to the announcement, Absolar had filed a lawsuit requesting the participation of solar projects in the A-6, which was not planned.

The UK government is holding meetings with potential hydrogen exporters. “Uruguay presented its priorities and highlighted opportunities for investment and bilateral cooperation in the renewable energy sector, particularly green hydrogen,” the government said after the first meeting of the UK-Uruguay Trade Dialogue.
American Airlines has announced an equity investment in Universal Hydrogen, which is building a green hydrogen distribution and logistics network for aviation. “This investment makes American the first US airline to make two direct investments focused on the development of both hydrogen-electric propulsion technology and the future of hydrogen distribution logistics,” said the Texas-based airline. Universal Hydrogen’s fuel distribution network uses modular hydrogen capsules handled like cargo, eliminating the need for new fueling infrastructure at airports. American Airlines joins Airbus Ventures, G.E. Aviation, and Toyota Ventures as strategic investors in Universal Hydrogen.
The European Commission has approved a €220 million ($214 million) Spanish measure to support Cobra in the production of renewable hydrogen. Cobra, which is still not active in hydrogen production, plans to produce green hydrogen for external industrial off-takers, particularly in energy-intensive and hard-to-abate sectors such as refineries and ceramics in Spain. The two electrolyzers will have a total capacity of 205 MW and will produce about 8,550 tons of renewable hydrogen and 6,840 tons of oxygen per year. The commission said the electrolyzers will be built in stages, with the first set to start operating in 2023.
Enel and Eni  have revealed that two of their joint green hydrogen projects will receive public funding under IPCEI Hy2Use. The two electrolysis systems will be installed at the Eni Biorefinery in Gela, Sicily (20 MW electrolyzer), and near the Eni Refinery in Taranto, Apulia (10 MW electrolyzer).
Smartenergy has secured consent from the Sassari Provincial Industrial Consortium to build a three-phase green hydrogen plant in Sardinia, Italy, which should be completed by 2030. It “will be developed in three phases (target capacity between 20 MW up to 200 MW), with estimated delivery dates between 2026 and 2030,” said the Swiss investment company. “Smartenergy will start permitting activities in the first half of 2023.”
ACWA Power and Korea Electric Power Corp. (Kepco) have signed a deal to develop green hydrogen and ammonia projects in the Middle East and other parts of the world to decarbonize Kepco's operations in South Korea. “The company intends to utilize the end product to operate its power plants in South Korea, on the proviso that KEPCO’s generation companies offtake the green ammonia from the potential project,” said the Saudi investor.
Hydro Havrand and H2 Green Steel have signed an agreement to jointly explore opportunities for large-scale green hydrogen production in Brazil and the Nordic countries. “If realized, the hydrogen production facility will enable approximately 5 million tons of green steel through direct iron reduction, in a plant owned by H2 Green Steel,” said the Norwegian company. 
Saic Maxus officially launched 80 hydrogen fuel cell multi-purpose vehicles on Xiangdao Robotaxi, a shared mobility platform held by Saix.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/14/global-polysilicon-capacity-could-hit-536-gw-by-end-of-2023/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 14, 2022",Global polysilicon capacity could hit 536 GW by end of 2023,"In its PV supplier report for the second quarter of 2022, solar and storage advisory Clean Energy Associates (CEA) said that polysilicon production capacity could reach 295 GW by the end of 2022, and 536 GW by the end of 2023.
CEA said it expects this production capacity to far exceed solar installations next year. While this may suggest that supply problems could begin to be alleviated, CEA said PV module capacity expansion is slowing. Many manufacturers are instead expanding cell production capacity, in support of the n-type TOPCon and HJT manufacturing trends.
Ingot capacity grew almost 30 GW in the second quarter, said CEA. It attributed this to two facilities that brought 23 GW online. Wafer capacity decreased slightly, said CEA, primarily because a major undisclosed supplier retired its multicrystalline wafer capacity. The 17 suppliers covered in the report boosted cell capacity by 22% in the second quarter of 2022, bringing 47 GW of capacity online, reaching a total of 262 GW.
PV module production reached 324 GW in the second quarter. CEA said it expects this could expand by 20% by this end of the year to reach 400 GW.
Only seven suppliers covered by the CEA report are fully vertically integrated from ingot to module production. Most of the others operate at the cell and module link in the supply chain.
“With growing merchant wafer options, there is little need for most suppliers to expand upstream,” said CEA.
It said suppliers are working to optimize wafer sizes after the industry standardized 210 mm (G12) and 182 mm (M10) module dimensions. The “182 mm Plus” (182P) has increased wafer heights to further reduce “white space” caused by intercell gaps to achieve up to 5 W of additional output, said CEA. The “210 mm Reduced” (210R) slashed wafer widths for niche rooftop applications at the expense of power output. CEA said it expects new module sizes for the residential solar market to be introduced.
Many analysts have predicted China will break 100 GW of installations this year. CEA expects slightly lower installations in China during 2022 due to high module prices impacting utility-scale projects. It said many investment decisions have been deferred, as projects could not meet their internal rate of return thresholds.
Most of the polysilicon supply chain originates in China. Outside of China, production capacities are 11 GW of ingots, 42 GW of cells, and 50 GW of modules. By the end of 2023, these capacities are expected to expand to 23 GW, 73 GW, and 74 GW, respectively.
“Policy uncertainties continue to defer expansion plans of suppliers as they remain cautious due to lingering policy uncertainty in the United States surrounding the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and anticircumvention investigation,” said CEA.

TENGs can convert mechanical energy into electricity through friction between different materials. They recently attracted significant attention due to their high instantaneous output power, the broad availability of materials, the sustainable and cheap fabrication process, and the different working modes they offer, depending on the applications.
The cleaning system combines the TENG with an electrodynamic dust shield (EDS), which uses traveling-wave or standing-wave electrodynamic effects to repel dust particles from a surface. The use of the EDS, on the other hand, is not new in solar energy research, as previous scientific works considered its use as a potential anti-dust solution for mitigating soiling loss.
The researchers said that the triboelectric generator they developed can be energized by stomping a foot on it several times. It can also vibrate without losing energy and generate alternating high voltage for periods of about 10 seconds.
“The generator showed a high energy conversion efficiency of about 50.8%, and it was confirmed that it could generate a high level of output to sufficiently operate the dust removal panel with a maximum voltage of 2.6 kV,” the scientists explained, noting that the achieved efficiency is considerably higher than that of similar TENGs.
The South Korean researchers claim that the system was able to remove 79.2% of the dust from a solar panel after 12 foot strikes. They described their results in “Highly efficient long-lasting triboelectric nanogenerator upon impact and its application to daily-life self-cleaning solar panel,” which was recently published in Nano Energy.
“Collectively, this work provides a strategy for harvesting energy from impacts and offers a useful application for self-cleaning solar panels,” they said. They illustrated how the system works in a video clip published on KAIST's YouTube channel.

The CompactFLAT GS mounting structure has a distance to the rooftop surface of 40 cm and is available in two versions, with tilt angles of 10 and 15 degrees.
“While CompactFLAT GS15 has a tilt angle of 15 degrees and is suitable for installing solar systems with south orientation, Aerocompact has designed the CompactFLAT GS10PLUS system with a tilt angle of 10 degrees for east/west orientation,” the company said. “With south orientation, there is no need for a wind deflector that prevents the reflection of light.”
It claims that the new system is easy to install and maintain, as it only consists of a few components, without the need for long rails. It is suitable for solar arrays on foil and bitumen roofs, as well as concrete and gravel roofs.
The new CompactFLAT GS mounting system comes with a 25-year warranty, according to the company.

Gold miner Evolution Mining, in cooperation with financial consultancy ICA Partners, is developing the Mt Rawdon Pumped Hydro Project in the Australian state of Queensland.
The plan is to use an enormous pit dug from decades of mining at Evolution Mining’s Mt Rawdon gold mine as the lower reservoir in the pumped hydro facility. The low-grade gold mining operation there is scheduled for closure in 2027.
The Mt Rawdon project aims to provide 2 GW of energy for 10 hours. The full feasibility study for the project is already underway and is set for completion by mid-2023. Queensland’s Coordinator-General has declared it a “coordinated project,” which will help to streamline and expedite development.
Like all pumped hydro projects, the plan is expected to be expensive, but the company’s executive chair, Jake Klein told The Australian last year that the Queensland government might be interested in acquiring the project, if the feasibility study shows enough promise.

In the second quarter, German PV production equipment providers saw a trend reversal. Incoming orders and sales, which had been limited since the start of the pandemic, rose by 62% compared to the previous quarter. Sales to European solar manufacturers have quadrupled over this period.
For the first time since VDMA began collecting statistics in 2008, incoming orders from European PV manufacturers were higher than those from their Asian counterparts.
“The European orders received in the first two quarters of 2022 have already exceeded the value of all European orders in 2021 fourfold,” the association said.
The industry expects an increase in sales for the third quarter, mainly due to the clearance of bottlenecks in the supply chain. And the biggest growth driver for equipment manufacturers is still the module production business.
Machines in this area accounted for almost one-third of total sales in the second quarter. In terms of sales, Asian solar manufacturers remain the most important source of income for German suppliers, at least for now, says VDMA.
“Although the orders in Asia are lower than in Europe in the second quarter of 2022, Asia is still at the top of the sales volume with a 52% share of the total market,” VDMA said.
In addition, sales in the United States increased from the preceding quarter, but orders fell slightly. According to the association, the current export rate for European PV production kit is 66%.
“In the past, the Asian market was the largest for German PV equipment providers, but orders in Europe have increased since the first quarter of 2022 and are expected to continue to increase,” said Jutta Trube, head of the photovoltaic production equipment department at VDMA. “In general, we expect continued strong demand due to the increasing interest in various countries in new local photovoltaic production.”
Supply chain bottlenecks from the pandemic have still not been completely overcome.
“Incoming orders for PV production machines from the EU increased in the second quarter,” said Peter Fath, managing director of RCT Solutions GmbH and Chairman of the VDMA Photovoltaic Production Equipment department. “The solar machine manufacturers are recording positive sales despite the ongoing pandemic-related supply chain bottlenecks and the shortage of skilled workers.”
Nevertheless, further increases in sales can be expected.
“The manufacturers of PV production equipment in the EU can cope with these bottlenecks and successfully defy these imponderables,” Fath said.
In addition, the political will in Europe to rebuild the solar industry is now tangible. Numerous initiatives are now aimed at reinvigorating the entire PV value chain in Europe.
“Currently, countries like the US and India are introducing very attractive initiatives to boost photovoltaic production; the same is required in Europe,” said Fath.

According to Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy, current spot prices in Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom would all result in payback of 12 months or less. Considering the average monthly spot prices for August in these countries were all well over €400/MWh and the relatively low operating costs of renewables, investing in utility-scale projects appear to be a no-brainer.
For instance, for a generic 250 MW solar project, assuming a long-term electricity price of €50/MWh ($49/MWh), the expected post tax return is approximately 6% with a payback period of 11 years, Rystad calculates. A price of €350/MWh or above results in a payback period of only one year while a price of approximately €180 – the European Commission’s proposed price threshold results in the payback time of five to six years.

Investors are seeing the opportunity. According to Rystad, capital investments in renewables have increased significantly and are set to reach $494 billion in 2022, outstripping upstream oil and gas at $446 billion for the year.
“Capital investments in renewables are set to outstrip oil and gas for the first time this year as countries scramble to source secure and affordable energy,” says Michael Sarich, senior vice president, Rystad Energy. “Investments into renewables are likely to increase further moving forward as renewable project payback times shorten to less than a year in some cases.”
Rise of storage
High energy prices but also newly adopted climate legislation, including the US inflation Reduction Act and European Union’s REPowerEU plan, are expected to give a big boost to the global energy storage market.
In its latest forecast, BloombergNEF says that energy storage installations around the world are projected to reach a cumulative 411 GW/1,194 GWh by 2030. That is 15 times the 27 GW/56 GWh of storage that was online at the end of 2021.
Driven by recent policy developments, BNEF has revised its previous estimates up by 13% from the ones presented in its 2H 2022 Energy Storage Market Outlook. This is equal to an extra 46 GW/145 GWh. While an estimated 387 GW/1,143 GWh will be added from 2022 to 2030, supply chain constraints will cloud deployment expectations until 2024, says BNEF.

The United States and China are set to remain the two largest markets, representing more than half of global storage installations by the end of the decade. Europe, however, is catching up with a significant ramp-up in capacity, driven by the current energy crisis.
BNEF’s forecast suggests that the majority of energy storage build by 2030, equivalent to 61% of megawatts, will be to provide energy shifting – that is, advancing or delaying the time of electricity dispatch. Co-located renewables-plus-storage projects, in particular solar-plus-storage, are becoming commonplace throughout the world, notes BNEF.

“Selenium element is a promising light-harvesting material for solar cells because of the large absorption coefficient and prominent photoconductivity,” the scientists said. “However, the efficiency of Se solar cells has been stagnated for a long time owing to the suboptimal bandgap (> 1.8 eV) and the lack of a proper electron transport layer.”
The researchers built the cell with an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, an electron transport layer (ETL) made of zinc-oxide (ZnO), a Se-Te absorber alloyed by using 70% of Se and 30% of Te, and a gold (Au) metal contact.
“Alloying selenium with tellurium, which has the same crystal structure and a narrow bandgap, can tune the bandgap and increase the melting point, thus expanding the absorption spectrum and improving the quality of the selenium solar cell films,” said lead author Chao Chen.
The research group pointed out the ZnO ETL as another decisive factor contributing to increase the overall cell efficiency. It is reportedly able to slightly react with selenium to enhance its interfacial adhesion and to reduce dangling bonds and thus reduce interfacial defects.
It tested the device under standard illumination conditions and found its power conversion efficiency reached 1.85%.
“The efficiency of ZnO/Se0.7Te0.3 solar cells has more than doubled after nine months in the air,” Chen also said, noting that the next steps in the research will be prepare high-quality Se-Te alloy films, eliminate holes and vacancy defects, and optimize device structure.
The scientists said that, thanks to the Se-Te absorber, the cell open-circuit voltage decreased as expected, while the short-circuit current did not always increase due to the current loss at long wavelengths. In addition, they found the fill factor was rather low because of the cliff at the interface and the leakage according to the small shunt resistance.
“We mainly focused on the device and analyzed its air stability, defect properties and recombination mechanism, for the sake of providing guidance for the further performance optimization,” they said.
They introduced the cell technology in “Fabrication and characterization of ZnO/Se1-xTex solar cells,” which was recently published in Frontiers of Optoelectronics.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/14/us-rooftop-solar-adoption-rising-as-system-value-increases/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"OCTOBER 14, 2022",US rooftop solar adoption rising as system value increases,"From pv magazine USA
Annual rooftop solar installations more than double to 14 systems per thousand households when homeowners earn a net present value, or “profit,” of $1,000 over 20 years, a new study shows. The numbers of systems are based on an average residential rooftop PV system size of 5 kW.
The rooftop solar adoption model was based on solar installation data from California, Massachusetts, Arizona, Germany and Japan from 2005 to 2016. A study presenting the model was published in the journal Renewable Energy.
The Sierra Club used the model, along with other arguments, to persuade Minnesota regulators to require utility Xcel Energy to evaluate, in its next resource plan, incentivizing distributed solar to substitute for more costly types of generation, thereby saving all customers money.
The Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) launched the work with a 50-state model that identifies the likely solar adoption rate in each state, based on state-specific data including solar resources, or insolation, and compensation for distributed solar generation. The spreadsheet model has 50 sheets, one for each state.
The model can be adjusted based on policy change, said John Farrell, an ILSR co-director. By focusing the model on the number of households in Xcel Energy’s service area, and the compensation for solar power sent to the grid, he said ILSR found that Xcel Energy’s forecasts “seemed very low,” at just 276 MW of all types of distributed solar over 15 years. In comparison, ILSR’s model, which counted only residential solar and not other types of distributed solar, projected at least 550 MW of residential solar over 15 years.
ILSR then worked to “figure out how much more solar could you get if the utility were to incentivize local solar at a price point that is lower than they would pay for other resources,” Farrell said, in a webinar hosted by the Sierra Club.
ILSR considered incentive levels ranging from $0.01 to $0.04 per kilowatt-hour of solar generation, beyond existing compensation, over a 15-year period.
Near-term victory
The Sierra Club then challenged, in formal comments to Minnesota regulators, the utility’s treatment of small-scale solar as more expensive than large-scale solar. Although large-scale solar has lower capital costs, the group has noted that individual ratepayers pay most of the capital costs of small-scale solar. “So it’s not reasonable” for the utility to model those costs as being paid by the utility and its ratepayers generally, according to Laurie Williams, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club.
Distributed solar also avoids the need for transmission lines, Williams said, and transmission is “very constrained” in the upper Midwest. Challenging Xcel Energy’s assumption that “they have no control over the level of distributed solar that would be adopted,” Williams said that utility programs, such as rebates, “can incentivize customers.”
The Sierra Club then “made many corrections to Xcel’s modeling assumptions,” Williams said, and conducted its own modeling, including the option for financial incentives to increase distributed solar adoption, and recommending an alternative resource plan that it said would save all consumers money.
Williams claimed a near-term win resulting from its work and that of four other groups, as the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission ordered Xcel Energy, in its next resource plan, to model distributed solar as a resource that can be incentivized, not as a fixed-quantity resource, and to “address” the costs of distributed solar borne by the utility, versus the costs borne by the customer. The four other groups were Vote Solar, ILSR, Cooperative Energy Futures and Environmental Law and Policy Center, which jointly filed separate formal comments with regulators.
The Sierra Club modeled Xcel Energy as having the ability to categorize owners of rooftops according to their willingness to install solar, and to offer the lowest incentives to those most willing to add solar, and the highest incentives to those least willing to do so.
Offering different incentive levels to different customers “could have proven to be a difficult program to administer,” said Will Kenworthy, Midwest regulatory director with Vote Solar, on the webinar. “So one of the lessons we learned during the back and forth with the utility and other stakeholders during the proceeding is that it may make sense to model a single incentive level in each given year.”
The research study used by ILSR is titled “Empirical development of parsimonious model for international diffusion of residential solar.” The study is available for free as an “open manuscript” at this page.
