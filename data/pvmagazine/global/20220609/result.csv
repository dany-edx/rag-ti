The PDL-Greene Solar Power Ltd joint venture set up by Hong Kong business Project Development Ltd and Bangladeshi thin-film solar manufacturer Greene Consortium Ltd is preparing to seek approval for 30 MW of solar generation capacity in the county, or upazila, of Teknaf.
“We will soon submit an application to the government seeking permission to set up the power plant,” PDL-Greene Solar MD Sheikh Abu Mahadi told pv magazine.
The initial project will require a $36.2 million investment and the facility will produce crops and fish, said Mahadi.
The initial development at the site will feature more than 69,000 unbranded bifacial solar modules across 114 acres.
A further 650 acres is available for the planned 170 MW expansion of the solar farm.
“Our funds are 100% secured as our partners have given confirmation,” added Mahadi, who said the developers want the site operational by 2024.
Teknaf is the site of Bangladesh's first utility scale solar site, a 20 MW facility which was switched on in 2018. The area has the highest solar radiance in the country: 1.55 MWh per kilowatt-peak of solar generation capacity per year.
Bangladesh has 788 MW of renewables generation capacity, of which 554.77 MW is solar.
Junior power minister Nasrul Hamid recently said he expects 1.4 GW of new solar capacity to come online by 2025 in Bangladesh.
The nation plans to generate 40% of its electricity from renewables by 2040.
Bangladesh’s first agrivoltaic plant, a 3.77 MW array developed by Solarland China and local company Mostafa Motors, received government approval in December last year.
The developer of that project, Soudia Agro Solar PV Power Plant Ltd, plans to complete the site by October.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/09/redox-flow-battery-based-on-ion-sieving-sulfonated-polymer-membranes/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 9, 2022",Redox flow battery based on ion-sieving sulfonated polymer membranes,"A group of researchers in the United Kingdom has developed a redox flow battery (RFB) based on aqueous organic-based electrolytes which they claim is capable of operating with remarkable stability.
The scientists used ion-exchange membranes with subnanometer ion transport pathways derived from polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), with either a rigid or contorted backbone, for the novel battery design. They utilized, in particular, a spirobifluorene-based PIM polymer (PIM-SBF), which they claim is able to retain high structural rigidity, block redox-active small molecules and facilitate salt ion transport.
These three actions combined are reportedly able to minimize so-called “crossover.” This phenomenon, which can cause capacity losses that can reach up to 50%, occurs during charging and recharging, when battery electrolyte components cross the membrane in the battery cell and the redoxmers – redox-active molecules that can store energy in the batteries' electrolytes – migrate to the wrong side of the device. “Sulfonated PIM membranes enable rapid transport of small salt cations and inhibits crossover of the large anions and anionic redox-active molecules, resulting in significantly improved performance in comparison to commercial ion exchange membranes and ion sieving membranes from state-of-the-art porous materials,” the scientists further explained, noting that they measure the permeability of salt ions and the crossover of redox-active electrolyte molecules through concentration-driven dialysis diffusion tests.
Through the measurements, the British group found that the battery flow cells based on sPIM-SBF membranes have improved energy efficiency and peak power density compared to reference RFB cells using conventional Nafion 115 membranes. The sPIM-SBF cells were able to maintain high energy efficiency and a very low-capacity decay rate of 0.0335% per day, or 0.0000795% per cycle, for about 120 h or 2,100 charge-discharge cycles. “This is two orders of magnitude lower than that of an otherwise identical RFB using Nafion 115 membrane,” the researchers stated. “It should be noted that these laboratory tests using low concentration of electrolyte resulted in multiple cycles each day, yet the results suggested that PIM membrane showed high rate of capacity retention due to minimal crossover over the testing period.”
The researchers also assumed that if the RFB stacks were operated under ideal conditions, such as constant operating temperature and no oxygen penetration, the capacity loss may come exclusively from membrane crossover. “These data allow the prediction that the highly ion-selective sPIM-SBF membrane would maintain 80% capacity performance of a practical RFB utilizing a high concentration of redox-active materials over 29 years, whereas, the same RFB using a Nafion 115 membrane would maintain 80% capacity performance for only 1.5 years,” they emphasized.
They presented the battery design in the paper “Development of efficient aqueous organic redox flow batteries using ion-sieving sulfonated polymer membranes,” published in nature energy. The research group includes academics from the Imperial College London and the University of Edinburgh. “Our study proves that engineering the subnanometer pores of membranes and enhancing the membrane selectivity substantively improves the performance of this class of RFBs,” they concluded.

South Korea-based photovoltaic manufacturer Hanwha Q Cell has revealed that the Dutch Court of Appeal in The Hague has issued a ruling confirming the cross-border injunction against the Dutch subsidiary of Chinese module manufacturer Longi — Longi (Netherlands) Trading B.V. — which was decided by the District Court of Rotterdam on March 15, 2022.
The injunction provided that Longi Solar's Dutch subsidiary may not encourage customers to infringe the EP ‘689 patent in countries where Hanwha Solutions Corporation is the registered owner. Longi Netherlands is not allowed to offer for sale, sell or distribute the modules related to the patent litigation in Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, France, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Austria, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.
Hanwha Q-Cells had sued Longi and other manufacturers for patent infringement of its solar cell passivation technology. The new ruling follows Longi's appeal against Hanwha Q-Cells' first favorable ruling in November 2021.
“Longi NL sought to establish, through execution proceedings, that its recall obligations are only applicable to products held in stock for future sales,” Hanwha Q Cells said in a statement. “The Preliminary Relief Judge of the Rotterdam District Court and The Hague Court of Appeal disagreed and ruled that the recall measure also applies to all products that infringe EP ’689 and that are professionally used by Longi NL’s customers. The infringing products are Longi solar modules of the Hi-M03, Hi-M03m, Hi-M04, Hi M04m, Hi-M05, and Hi-M05m types (except for products referred to by HIH, HIB, and HIBD).”
According to Hanwha Q-Cells, it is clear after the most recent decision that Longi NL must extend the recall campaign to all of its customers, such as PV product distributors, installers, project developers and plant operators, that purchased or use corresponding modules covered by the patent dispute. “Longi NL’s customers may return the infringing products at Longi NL’s expenses for an immediate refund of the purchase price,” the Korean manufacturer stated, noting that, if necessary, further legal action would be taken.
A pv magazine request for comment from Longi about the ruling has so far remained unanswered.
The patent dispute between the photovoltaic manufacturers dates back to spring 2019. In March 2019, Hanwha Q-Cells filed a patent infringement lawsuit in both Germany and the United States, and shortly afterward in Australia, against Longi, REC and a third defendent, JinkoSolar. According to the company, its three competitors illegally used its patented technology in their products. In June 2020, the Regional Court of Düsseldorf in Germany ruled in favor of Hanwha Q-Cells in the first instance. REC and Longi Solar appealed against the decision, whereupon Hanwha Q-Cells initiated the preliminary enforcement of the decision. In Hanwha Q-Cells' view, Longi Solar and REC did not take sufficient measures to comply with the court-ordered recall obligation.

The latest round of Modernisation Fund awards included backing for eight mining-related solar sites in the country.
The town of Rovinari, which hosts a 1,320 MW coal-fired power plant that is being upgraded with a further 500 MW of generation capacity, will receive a total of almost €285 million for four photovoltaic sites on mining waste piles and an ash and slag deposit.
Similar solar sites will be funded at Pinoasa, Bohorelu-Jilt, Isalnita, and Turceni, in a round of awards announced by the European Commission this week.
The Modernisation Fund aims to help coal-dependent EU member states Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia with the energy transition.
The pot is funded by revenue from the sale of carbon emission permits under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Some 2% of revenue generated by permits sold in those member states backs the Modernisation Fund in most cases, although Croatia, Czechia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia hand over more of the receipts.
Romania also secured €10.5 million of the total €2.4 billion disbursed in the latest funding round for smart grid upgrades to the transmission system for a nuclear plant and renewables sites in Dobrogea.
Czechia was awarded €150 million for clean energy projects with a generation capacity of more than 1 MW, €100 million for communally-owned PV projects, and €50 million for solar for small municipalities, with the three prizes to be distributed under the country's RES+ incentives program.
Lithuania secured €2.5 million for green hydrogen production capacity plus €10 million for clean power for energy intensive industries covered by the EU ETS and €15 million for electric vehicle purchase incentives.
Among the other awards, Hungary was allocated €51.4 million for energy storage facilities to back its grid, Croatia landed €40 million for its renewables generation incentives scheme, and Poland was awarded €11.1 million for clean power for its energy-intensive industries.
Each eligible member state is given access to a different proportion of the Modernisation Fund cash, ranging from 43.4% for coal-heavy Poland to 1.4% for Latvia.
Member states have until August 16 to submit non-priority projects for the next funding round, and until September 13 for priority awards.

German insurance and financial services group Signal Iduna and its Hansainvest Real Assets unit have begun construction of what could be the largest solar park in Germany — and Europe — some 30 kilometers south of Leipzig.
The ground-breaking ceremony for the 650 MW solar park took place on Wednesday at the former brown coal opencast mine Witznitz II. The project is expected to require a total area of 500 hectares and a further 150 hectares of compensatory land. The final building permit, however, is still pending.
The project developer and general contractor, Moveon Energy, will be responsible for installing 1.1 million solar modules at the facility, which is expected to come online in the second quarter of 2023. The plant will sell power to undisclosed industrial and large customers by means of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).
The Witznitz energy park will revitalize a previously little-used area. The creation of new bike and riding trails of 13 kilometers each and associated resting places is planned and intended to support tourism in the region. There are also ecological aspects that are expected to be taken into account when realizing the solar park.
Signal Iduen also wants to include agricultural activities below the solar modules on a test area of five to 10 hectares. The company is planning the construction of a solid hydrogen storage facility for its own electricity needs as well as quick charging stations for cars and bicycles. Due to the existing network infrastructure, it is also considering the coupling of solar power generation with electrolyzers for the production of green hydrogen.

Two of the approved projects, with capacities of 150 MW and 90 MW and are located in the municipalities of Tuscania and Vitorchiano, respectively, in the historic Tuscia region, in Latium's province of Viterbo. It is interesting to note that these projects may have been among those whose approval was scrapped by the Italian government in June 2020, at the request of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities. “The location of the two plants between the north of Italy and Rome is strategically advantageous, as these regions have higher electricity prices,” KGAL said.
The Tuscia area is known for having abundant grid-connection capacity due to the presence of Italy's only nuclear power plant, now decommissioned. It also hosts some of Italy’s largest PV plants, including an 84 MW solar facility, completed in 2010, and the country’s first grid-parity utility-scale solar projects – built by UK-based Octopus Investments in 2017.
The third project for which KGAL secured a permit is described as a 140 MW agrivoltaic solar facility, which is planned to be constructed in Pietra Monreale, in the province of Palermo, Sicily, which will host olive trees and vegetable crop growth. “The three plants are expected to begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2024,” the investment firm stated, adding that construction was expected to start soon.
The Italian government said this week that it expected around 3.3 GW of new solar power to be deployed in the country this year. This impressive growth should be triggered by the above-mentioned more favorable authorization processes.
*The headline of the article was amended to reflect that the combined capacity of the three projects is 380 MW.

“We are also planning to launch the production of two new solar modules relying on M12 wafers with a nominal power of 590 W and 650 W, respectively, in the third quarter of this year,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The new module, dubbed SunDay 10, uses 144 monocrystalline half-cut cells based on M1o wafers and busbar technology. It is available in three versions with nominal power of 540 W to 550 W and power conversion efficiency spanning from 20.89% to 21.28%. The open-circuit voltage is between 49.50 V and 49.80 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.85 A and 13.99 A.
The panel measures 2,279 mm x 1,134 mm x 35 mm and weighs 32.8 kg. It is built with 2 mm tempered anti-reflective glass and an aluminum alloy frame. It also features an IP68 enclosure and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The panel has a temperature coefficient of -0.39% per degree Celsius and its operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
The new product comes with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 10-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 2.5% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 83.0% of the nominal output power.
SDN announced plans to start the new module production in September 2021. The company is also active in both the distributed generation and large-scale project development business. It has developed several solar parks across Bulgaria, Japan and its home country. Its shipbuilding division supplies outboard motors for fishing and leisure boats.

“Energy Dome will operate the plant commercially on the Italian grid,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “The commercial demonstration plant is planned to be operated commercially on the electrical grid providing most needed regulation services onto the electrical grid as storage standalone. The power for charging the plant is drawn from the national grid.”
According to the company, the pilot project is currently providing the expected performance in terms of long-duration storage and round-trip efficiency. “The Sardinia demonstration project has proven this innovative process using off-the-shelf equipment available from a globally established supply chain, demonstrating that the rapid global deployment of the CO2 Battery is now possible with no bottlenecks,” it said in a statement, without providing more details on the project.
Energy Dome said, however, that it was planning to build its first full-scale 20 MW/200 MWh commercial plant soon and to finalize its construction by the end of 2023. “To achieve this, Energy Dome has tapped a team of experts in turbomachinery, process engineering and energy, with a proven track record in ventures designing novel turbines and building over 500 MW of energy projects,” it further explained.

The company recently entered into a cooperation agreement with Italian utility A2A for the construction of a 20 MW facility with a five-hour storage capacity. It also signed a deal with the industrial conglomerate Ansaldo to develop and build long-duration energy storage projects in Italy, Germany, the Middle East and Africa.
Energy Dome's battery is based on compressed CO2 and, according to the manufacturer, it requires less space than systems based on compressed air. “The concept is the same as compressed air energy storage (CAES) and liquid air technologies,” Energy Dome CEO Claudio Spadacini told pv magazine in a recent interview.

The system draws CO2 from an inflatable atmospheric gas holder, which the company calls the “Dome,” and stores it under 70 bar pressure at ambient temperature in a high-density liquid state. When the stored energy is needed, the CO2 is evaporated and conveyed through a turbine that produces power. After this process is implemented, the CO2 goes back to the atmospheric gas holder to be used again for another storage cycle, without any emissions to the atmosphere.
Energy Dome's battery was a winner in the Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) Pioneers 2022 technology competition.

EnerVenue, a nickel-hydrogen battery startup that launched at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in the summer of 2020, announced it signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) agreement with Sonnell Power Solutions for Sonnell to procure and deploy 40 MWh of EnerVenue’s EnerStation battery systems in 2023, and 420 MWh in 2024 and 2025 across Puerto Rico.
According to EnerVenue, the batteries will be used to support Puerto Rico’s industrial sector, as many of the Island’s businesses are actively seeking ways to transition their energy supply into a renewable mix. This trend has emerged since Hurricane Maria in 2017 and the persistent power grid deficiencies left in the storm’s aftermath.
“The industrial sector in Puerto Rico faces a crucial and time-sensitive need for more sustainable, affordable, and reliable energy,” said José Rodríguez Varela, president of Sonnell Power Solutions. “EnerVenue fits into our mission to provide the off-grid alternative energy path forward that industrial businesses are so eager to adopt – one that is safe and built to last.”
EnerVenue’s batteries were selected by Sonnell due to their chemistry’s lack of thermal runway or fire risk. The systems also deliver differentiated tolerance to extreme temperatures and environmental conditions, making them optimal for industrial usage.
“We anticipate that EnerVenue will become a cornerstone technology for us, where we are able to fulfill the market’s energy transformation needs now and going forward,” continued Varela.
EnerVenue is betting on the success of metal hydrogen batteries, specifically nickel-hydrogen batteries. This chemistry has proven to be an incredibly powerful energy storage technology for the aerospace industry for quite some time, but was always held back from greater commercial success due to its high price. According to Dr. Yi Cui, chief technology advisor with EnerVenue, the company has been able to achieve commercialization via “a breakthrough competitive price using new low-cost materials.”
Unlike lithium-ion, EnerVenue’s metal-hydrogen batteries are claimed to be able to operate in conditions of extreme heat and extreme cold.
EnerVenue claims that the company’s batteries have a more than 30-year lifespan, can go through more than 30,000 cycles without experiencing degradation and offer exceptional overcharge, over-discharge, and deep-cycle capabilities. The company also claims cost per kWh is as low as a penny, as well as capital expenditure costs that beat lithium-ion.
In May, EnerVenue and Pine Gate Renewables signed a multi-year agreement under which Pine Gate will procure and deploy 2400 MWh of EnerVenue’s battery energy storage systems in the United States to support their growing energy storage project pipeline. EnerVenue’s batteries will be supplied to Pine Gate to provide a choice in storage technology for Pine Gate’s development partners and customers, giving said customers the freedom to choose a technology that meets long-term reliability, energy and capacity needs.

Rooftop solar PV systems and energy-saving upgrades to home appliances are on offer for eligible households across New South Wales (NSW) as part of an AUD 128 million ($91.7 million) initiative included in the state government’s upcoming budget.
The Energy Bill Buster program, which is to replace the Empowering Homes initiative, will allow eligible households to receive the equivalent of up to 10 years’ worth of rebates in an upfront lump sum contribution of approximately AUD 2,850 towards a solar system or home appliance upgrade.
About one-third of NSW households that have a pensioner concession cardholder already receive a low-income energy rebate to help with bills but the Energy Bill Buster program will allow eligible households to apply for an upfront payment instead of the annual AUD 285 subsidy.
Eligible households will be able to use the money to install a 3 kW solar system. The state government estimates the array could save a household up to AUD 600 a year, instead of the annual AUD 285 low-income household rebate.
If the household has access to gas, they will receive an additional AUD 110 subsidy. For those homes not able to install solar, the government is offering access to AUD 4,000 in home appliance upgrades.
NSW Treasurer Matt Kean said the package would help ease cost-of-living pressures as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and supply chain disruptions push up energy prices.
“People living in apartments or renting who can’t have solar installed may be eligible to swap their rebate for a suite of energy saving appliance upgrades, helping to reduce demand on the grid and lower power prices for everyone,” he said.
These appliances include energy-efficient fridges, dryers, air conditioners and hot water systems, as well as energy efficiency upgrades such as window shading and draught sealing.
Climate Council campaigner Louis Brailsford welcomed what he said was a sensible policy, adding that it would provide practical help to households in creating a sustained reduction in power bills while cutting emissions at the same time.
“The surge in gas prices this year should spur governments around the country to speed up the phase out of fossil fuels in favor of affordable renewables. Replacing inefficient gas appliances in homes with electric alternatives is one of the easiest ways to do this,” he said.
“The quickest and cheapest way to increase Australia’s supply of clean affordable energy is to replace fossil fuels with renewables and electrify our households and businesses.”
The NSW government said it would initially provide funding in the budget for 30,000 households to access the upfront payments, at a cost of AUD 128 million, but would consider further spending if there is strong uptake. The NSW 2022-23 budget is to be announced on June 21.
The Energy Bill Buster program replaces the NSW government’s Empowering Homes initiative, which provided eligible homeowners with access to interest-free loans for battery and solar-battery systems. The program promised interest-free loans of up to AUD 9,000 for a battery system or up to AUD 14,000 for a solar and battery system. Applications for the Empowering Homes pilot will close on July 31.
The NSW government’s unveiling of the Energy Bill Buster program comes just days after its South Australia counterpart axed a string of renewable energy initiatives introduced to help homeowners access solar, battery energy storage systems and electric vehicle charging solutions.
The South Australian government last week announced it would abandon the AUD 100 million Home Battery Scheme, the Electric Vehicle Smart Charging Subsidy, and the AUD 4.25 million Switch for Solar program.

The utility-scale solar power plant fleet of the United States has surpassed 50 GW of instantaneous generation. This data comes to us via the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Hourly Electricity Grid Monitor.
EIA’s grid monitoring tool is a sum of most utility-scale electricity generation in the lower 48 United States. Behind the meter solar generation is not accounted for in these values.
The first time that more than 50 GW was produced in the United States occurred on Sunday June 5, 2022 at 4 pm EST, when the online tool registered solar production at 50,157 MW of total output.
 
This was brought to pv magazine USA’s attention by a tweet that referenced the event from Joe Deely.
On Monday June 6, the fleet’s instantaneous generation remained above 50 GW generation for three hours – from 2 to 5 pm EST, peaking at just over 51 GW during the 2 pm hour. As the year’s longest day is June 21, 2022, peak solar generation is expected to occur around this period.
Jason O’Leary, principal analyst, PV intel told pv magazine USA that utility-scale solar also broke another key value on March 2 of this year – meeting 10% of the grid’s electricity generation at 1 pm on March 2, 2022.
Since then, solar has broken that 10% value almost 70 times.

On Monday June 6 at 2 pm EST, when it set the current peak value at over 51 GW, utility solar was delivering 9.3% of all electricity generation. On March 22 at 2 pm EST saw utility-scale solar peak at 11.3% of all tracked electricity generation.
Per the EIA’s tool, last year’s peak solar generation value reached 38.6 GW on June 14, 2021 at 3 pm EST, which means the peak value so far this year grew just over 24%. Total solar capacity deployed in the United States grew about 25% in 2021 over 2020’s value.
Two important volumes of electricity generation are not included in these values. The first volume – Hawaii and Alaska – would have a peak generation time much later in the day, and thus wouldn’t have had much of an effect on the peak value.
The second volume, however, is massive – that being the non-utility- scale capacity in the nation. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the US has over 123 GWdc of solar capacity. About 40 GW of that volume is in non-utility-scale settings, and thus is not accounted for by this tool.

If the nation’s roughly 79 GWdc to 83 GWdc of utility-scale capacity is producing 50 GW at its peak, then small scale solar’s roughly 40 GW of volume would likely be outputting in the 20 to 25 GW range, bringing the nation’s total peak instantaneous solar generation value into the 70 GW to 75 GW range.
