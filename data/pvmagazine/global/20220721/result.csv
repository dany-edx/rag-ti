In the IN2 NEXT project, PV-coated windows from NEXT Energy Technologies were tested against traditional commercial windows, tracking performance based on their respective solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC), an industry-standard performance metric for commercial windows. The results show that NEXT Energy’s technology could lower the SHGC from an otherwise equal window to below .20.
NEXT Energy is a Calif.-based company that is developing transparent energy harvesting window technology. The goal is to enable glass facades to be turned into producers of low-cost, on-site, renewable energy for buildings. NEXT Energy participated in a multi-year photovoltaic window project as part of the Wells Fargo Innovation Incubator (IN2), which measured the overall energy-efficiency performance of NEXT Energy transparent PV windows compared to traditional commercial windows.
Commercial buildings account for 36% of all US electricity consumption at a cost of more than $190 billion annually. Additionally, windows represent 30% of a commercial building’s heating and cooling energy, costing US building owners about $50 billion annually, according to DOE. Considering the potential savings, in addition to energy generation, lowering the SHGC to .20 is significant. SHGC measures the amount of heat, or solar gain, created by sunlight passively entering buildings through windows. Excessive solar gain can lead to overheating within a space and inefficient energy management throughout a building.
“These are extremely significant results for the energy efficiency of insulating glass. Achieving a SHGC below .20 while providing neutral aesthetics has been a monumental challenge for all of us that create vacuum deposition architectural coated glass. Balancing performance and appearance is the heart of ideal harmony and it appears NEXT has done just that,” said Garret Henson, vice president sales and marketing at Viracon, a manufacturer of architectural glass for commercial buildings in North America.
In making NEXT Energy’s windows, the PV technology is enabled by proprietary organic semiconducting materials that are earth-abundant and low-cost, the company reports. This material is coated uniformly onto glass as an ink in a high-speed, low-cost, low-energy process, enabling the glass to harvest the sun’s light and convert it into electricity rather than heat.
“The results of the collaboration with NEXT give us data on how to redefine ways architects and building owners measure the performance of commercial windows,” said Trish Cozart, program manager of IN2 and director of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center at NREL. “If you can generate substantial amounts of electricity with a building’s windows, it can mark a new chapter. Now, the goal is the evaluation of SHGC to account for impacts of power generation as well as solar heat gain.”

Its building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) product portfolio consists mainly of three products – two types of solar tiles with a nominal power of 90 W and 108 W, respectively, and a rooftop PV system. “We use solar panels from the world's top manufacturers for our full solar roof. We add proprietary and patented aluminum technology, called Click-On frame, that turns a conventional solar panel into the weatherproof roofing material,” Solarstone CEO, Silver Aednik, told pv magazine. “The result is an aesthetically pleasing two-in-one solar roof.”
According to the manufacturer, the Click-On kit tackles the main issues BIPV has been facing, which are compatibility, scalability and complexity of installation. The Click-On profiles are reportedly compatible with the products of most Tier-1 solar panel manufacturers. “The profiles can be fitted on-site and even the most complex rooftop configurations can be handled with ease,” the company said.
One of the two solar tiles, dubbed Solarstone 90 W, has a power conversion efficiency of 19.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 11.22 V, and a short-circuit current of 9.58 A. It has dimensions of 1,530 mm x 395 mm x 31 mm and weighs in at 7 kg.

The tile relies on eight cells measuring 156 mm x 156 mm and 3.2 mm prismatic glass.
The second tile, called Solarstone 108 W, has a larger size of 1,824 mm x 389 mm x 22 mm and a weight of 8 kg. It features an efficiency of 19%, an open-circuit voltage of 12.9 V, and a short-circuit current of 8.39 A.

Both solar tiles come with a 10-year product warranty and a 25-year power output guarantee. They are fabricated with an IP65 enclosure and have an operating temperature coefficient of -0.41% per C. The maximum system voltage for both products is 600 V.
The Solar Roof system consists of standard PV panels fitted with Click-on technology and aluminum composite panels (ACPs). “Its size is variable and is suitable for residential projects, carports, and facades,” the company's CEO said, noting that the panels can be installed in either a landscape or portrait configuration.
“Right now, headquarters and factory are based in Viljandi, Estonia,” Silver noted. “As a manufacturing company, we emphasize automation, one of the main areas where we use the investment. Increasing production capacity and robotizing lines will prepare us for increasing demand.”

Yes, I believe so. Solar lights are an affordable, clean and safe solution for people who lack access to light after the sun sets. Our program, Light Libraries, is designed to increase access to solar lights in rural communities for students coming from households which struggle to purchase a light outright. The program is built on the idea of giving students the opportunity to access a solar light through their school. Students are already reporting improved grades.
We are encouraging more organizations to adopt and replicate this model to help reach more people. That is why we are excited to have just launched a new open source Solar Light Library toolkit, which is free to download. The toolkit enables schools and development actors to establish their own solar Light Library. As a sector, we need to step up our efforts if we are to reach universal access to power. Only through sharing, collaboration and partnership will we achieve our goals.
Solar lights have become increasingly affordable over the past 15 years, with prices dropping from over $30 to just $5. This has been made possible with increases in efficiency and a reduction in the cost of the key components – namely LEDs, solar panels, and rechargeable lithium batteries.
However, for the poorest families even the most affordable solar light remains out of reach. Many children are forced to use open flames or toxic kerosene just to study. It was with this in mind that we created Light Libraries in 2019. It works like a book library. For as little as one cent a day, which is much less than families spend on candles, kerosene or batteries, students can borrow a solar light. Each Light Library school is also equipped with a solar system to light up classrooms.
This gives students an immediate safe light to study by in the evening, but it also works as a “try before you buy” model for all, it builds trust in solar products, and ultimately gets solar customers on the first step of the energy ladder.
Yes. When we are speaking to students who have been borrowing a solar light, they tell us that after homework has been done, their parents are also using the light for household chores. Some students have told us their siblings, who may be attending schools which do not yet have a Light Library, are also using the light for their homework.
Access to solar lights benefits the whole family and it means they are suddenly spending less on other light sources that may be expensive and often dangerous, such as candles or toxic kerosene – which also contributes to indoor air pollution.
While lights are more affordable than ever before, with millions of households now accessing solar lights, price is still a barrier for many low-income households. There is a limit to who the market can serve and who can still not afford it. Also, it’s not profitable for many businesses to operate at scale in low income communities – which leads to an access and availability barrier.
This is where our social enterprise SunnyMoney comes in. Through our social enterprise, we are able to deliver lights to last mile, rural communities that the traditional market is not reaching. Through our programs, we are working to ensure we are able to reach everyone within these communities.
The solar Light Librarians are teachers, students, or parent-teacher association members, they do not receive commission from the Light Libraries. However, a proportion of revenue from Light Libraries goes to the local school. Also, each Light Library is twinned with a ‘rent to own’-model which enables the student to own a light, this happens through our local solar entrepreneurs, who are earning income on it.
We have sold over 2.2 million solar lights across Malawi, Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and Senegal. We are currently going deep into Malawi and Zambia, while developing partnerships in Senegal and exploring a partnership in Madagascar. We plan to focus on countries where the access to electricity challenge is the most acute and where we can add the greatest value to local partner NGOs and solar enterprises.
Over the past 12 months, we have powered over 30 health facilities with solar lighting and handheld medical equipment and we are already seeing great impact and improvement in the quality of care delivered. It’s been incredible hearing the testimonies from patients and healthcare professionals. Women who no longer have to worry about giving birth in complete darkness, or healthcare professionals forced to carry out life threatening procedures by candlelight. Early impact from our monitoring and evaluation work is showing that almost all (97%) health care staff and patients (93%) in the clinics in Zambia are saying the quality of care has improved because of the solar powered equipment – that is really fantastic. We are now continuing to work with health authorities in both Malawi and Zambia to scale access.
Generally, people in the rural communities we work in have some knowledge that solar exists – but there is a lack of trust in the product and of understanding for how it works. Normally, when we are just starting to work in communities, we work with building trust in the product. Normally after a few months of working in the area, we notice a difference and we can start building strong connections between our social enterprise and the community.
There are several ways to get involved with SolarAid and to be part of our mission to bring more safe and renewable light to sub-Saharan Africa. People can either get in touch with us on social media (@solaraid), visit our website (solar-aid.org), or get in touch with our Supporter Engagement team to learn how to donate.

According to the scientists, BPs are crucial for optimal water management within the cell, which prevents flooding and improves the cell operation at high current densities. “A properly optimized flow design allows the fuel cell to develop uniform and stable power output and correctly manage spin-off water from the reaction,” they stated.
Through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models and simulations, the Spanish group investigated several bioinspired flow channel structures such as leaves, lungs, or sponges and sought to assess which of them offer the best performance in terms of reactant distribution, pressure, and velocity fields.
The academics created three different flow channel architectures. The first one, named Design A, is symmetric with respect to the BP diagonal and consists of a branch going along the BP diagonal with ramified secondary branches in a perpendicular direction, which in turn are linked via tertiary perpendicular branches. The second flow channel configuration, called Design B, consists of a double serpentine flow channel with a continuous flow from inlet to outlet and a geometrical symmetry with respect to the main BP diagonal. The Design C architecture is based on an inlet collector and an outlet collector connected in parallel with six groups of straight channels in sets of seven channels each.
The performance of the three architectures was compared to that of a reference design with a parallel-serpentine design of 50 cm2 active area from US-based ElectroChem Inc. “The experimental work was conducted with a PEM fuel cell test station, devoted to the experimental testing of PEM single cells and short stacks up to 500 W,” the researchers said.
A slightly modified version of Design C including graphene porous sponge inserts was the architecture with the best performance. It exhibited the most homogeneous velocity flow field, an average velocity of 1.71 m/s), a standard deviation velocity of 2.87 m/s, and a lower pressure drop of 1042.8 Pa.
“Even though lower performance was observed for the biomimetic design in comparison to the parallel-serpentine for lower cell temperatures (4.1% lower), higher cell backpressure (6.2% lower) and higher cathode stoichiometric factor of 3.5 (21.2% lower), the novel biomimetic design showed a better performance when operating at higher relative humidity values of 90%, reaching out a peak power a 6.0% higher, indicating that the proposed novel biomimetic design is particularly suited for improved water management at high reactants humidity,” the academics concluded.
Their findings were presented in the paper Experimental and numerical Investigation on the design of a bioinspired PEM fuel cell, published in Energy.

“For an unknown reason, the grass around the solar park caught fire,” the municipality's fire department said in a statement. “The dry grass and the strong wind contributed to increasing the fire, which burnt a large area.”
According to Zealand's safety agency Zeeland Veilig, the fire brigade was able to control the fire, which hit an area of around 5,000 square meters, in around two hours. “The fire burnt the grass under the panels and the solar panels were not affected,” the agency said.

In the study “Experimental evaluation of compressed air energy storage as a potential replacement of electrochemical batteries,” which was recently published in the Journal of Energy Storage, the UAE group described the experimental setup as a unit combining a CAES system operating as an AC generator that is connected to various loads through an electrical panel. Its performance was compared to that of a 12 V, 70 Ah battery provided by US-based Incoe Corporation, which was connected via a 600 W inverter through an inversion circuit to the same load.
The CAES system consists of an air motor connected to a 3-phase, permanent magnet AC generator supplying 380 V and 5 A. The connection was made either directly or through a 1:2 or 1:4 speed-up gearboxes to compare the discharge time and output energy quality. The system also had a rudimentary heat exchanger – a pipe loop in a water bath – to control air temperature, which affects air density significantly, resulting in better system efficiency. The scientists tested two different motor sizes of 5 hp and 9 hp, respectively.
The performance of both storage technologies was measured in terms of energy stored per cubic meter, costs, and payback period. “In order to assess system performance, three loads are operated, a 6 W fan, 100 W lamp, and a 250 W drill,” the scientists explained. “A No-load condition was also performed to determine the full capacity of the system and compare it with theoretical calculations in terms of voltage and time of discharge.”
The researchers also installed electrical cabinets to receive load cables from the generator in order to investigate the suitability of the CAES system for industrial applications. “These include Industry-standard sockets for single phase and three phases with two different colors, protect against inadvertent electric shocks, provide earth leakage protection and finally the coated panel provides protection against environmental elements,” they emphasized.
The academics explained that the quality of the energy generated by the generator's air motor, which is in turn activated by the kinetic energy coming from the storage air cylinders of the CAES system, is provided by maintaining operation at the rated rotational speed of the generator in order to satisfy the minimum output voltage and operational frequency that will eventually be supplied to the end-users.
According to their calculations, the theoretical maximum output power of the CAES system, at 12 bar pressure, should be 0.048 kW and its theoretical roundtrip efficiency was estimated at 86.6 %. The experimental maximum output power of the system, however, was 27% lower at 0.035 kW and its experimental roundtrip efficiency was around 60%. The battery was found to ensure continuous operation of around 50 minutes, after which the power supplied to the inverter proved to be insufficient and the loads were immediately unpowered.
“The main factors to enhance roundtrip efficiency are the larger air storage volumes to ensure consistent pressure input to the air motors, better thermal management of air temperature, connecting more than one tank to the system and operating them in series or in tandem and finally having an air motor/generator as a single unit to overcome mechanical losses,” Alami further explained. “Simulation and control of system operation allowing input pressure variation to follow demand is another important factor in enhancing operation and scale up.”
In their cost comparison, the researchers considered an 840 kWh/3.5 kW CAES setup and a 1400 kWh lead Acid battery connected to a 3.5 kW battery inverter. The cost of the second setup was estimated at $130,307 and that of the CAES system at $23,780.
“As a rough estimate, breakeven point with a battery storage system can be achieved within 3–5 years depending on charge-discharge cycles required from the battery and no including the price for battery cabinet, air conditioning and the costs of the cooling load,” they highlighted, noting that if the CAES capacity is solely a function of the storage tanks capacity and space available for them, the above-ground footprint of the system is minimal and comparable with a battery enclosure connected to an air conditioning split unit. “The payback period, in this case, would be around 1–2 years,” they said.
The research team is currently considering how to bring the proposed storage technology closer to commercial production. “The system is intrinsically compatible with off-grid solar farms, charging the tanks with high-pressure 100 bar air compressors with a capacity of around 30 kW,” Alami said. “With tanks available and amenable to underground burial, the main technical issues of the system are clear and manageable for such installations. Also, the system can power EV chargers in off-grid locations.”

Cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar panels, famously made by First Solar, are an essential part of the US solar module ecosystem. Aaron Bates, the founder of Toledo Solar, an Ohio-based manufacturer of CdTe modules, told pv magazine USA that the technology has grown from a small fraction of solar projects to the dominant source of modules in utility-scale projects.
Bates came from an institutional finance background, and when he first got involved in solar, he was intrigued by this level of growth and began investigating. He said he was trying to find reasons not to enter the space, and the more he looked, the more CdTe became appealing. Eventually, he purchased an existing CdTe facility in Ohio, which today operates as the module supplier Toledo Solar.
Bates said that 90% of US utility-scale projects last year were CdTe, and the utility-scale sector makes up about 55% of all solar capacity added. About 20 years ago, it represented less than 1% of solar installations. So why all the growth, and why did Bates enter the market?
There are quite a few reasons to support CdTe and US-made solar, said Bates, including technological advantages, bankability, recyclability, supply chain stability, improved labor practices, and more.
Performance
First, Bates said CdTe has a wider range of spectral responses than polysilicon cells, the main source of US solar panels. Unlike polysilicon, CdTe is photoactive to the entire visible light spectrum. This factor is not measured in efficiency ratings, but it is measured in the final kWh output of the panel, said Bates.
Because CdTe is largely used at the utility scale, projects are quite large, making investment and liability high. Due to this, stability and bankability, and decreased risk are important, both in the supply and delivery of planned projects, and the performance in the field.
Bates said the degradation level of CdTe is much lower than polysilicon modules, and they perform better in high temperatures, meaning the technology is a safer bet for investors who sign 20 to 30-year power purchase agreements with large utility off-takers. This is important to utilities, too, which are mandated to supply a reliable, stable source of electricity.
Recycling
Bates credits First Solar for being a pioneer in solar module recycling, an industry that is woefully underfunded and underbuilt in the silicon solar cell space.
“First Solar has been doing this for 25+ years. They lead the world of PV in recycling. There’s a higher percentage, no matter if you want to measure it by weight or components or the cost of said components, there’s a higher percentage of recycled everything in a CadTel module. More recycled material than even what’s in automobiles, which are made of highly recycled materials, whether it’s steel, aluminum, plastics, polymers,” said Bates.
First Solar has already set up recycling centers globally for CdTe modules and has sharpened best practices for using the most material possible from retired panels. Bates said PV is notoriously bad at recyclability, with CdTe being an exception.
Normally, in any manufacturing process there is some scrap or excess material thrown away, but this is not the case for Toledo Solar. “We don’t throw anything away. Everything gets recycled. And it goes back into the supply chain, which not only benefits the industry to keep the costs down, but also helps the planet,” said Bates. “It’s ironic when solar panels are not recycled, or made of recycled material, or are just thrown away.”
Supply chains
Supply shortages have been the dominant problem for the buildout of solar in 2022. For many in the industry, the Department of Commerce’s investigation into Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand for alleged harboring of tariff-circumventing Chinese goods came under the crosshairs as a major reason for the shortage. The potential of large tariffs being retroactively applied to goods shipped from the four nations, which supply about 80% of US polysilicon solar panels, caused many developers to cancel or delay projects due to the uncertainty it caused.
Bates questioned whether these were genuine concerns, or if they were instead talking points to continue to support these international supply chains. He pointed to the fact that the Biden Administration did not increase tariff levels and that Commerce was following laws that had already existed for years.
Bates instead pointed to the fact that global supply chains were already brittle, and that even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns were being raised about the stability and sensibility of sourcing from foreign nations the vast majority of the components that will power the energy transition.
Struggles related to this have persisted in other industries that have largely been shipped overseas, like the glass and steel industries. Major glass supply chains haven’t been built in the United States. since the mid-1980s. It became a massive bane to the automotive industry, as steel and other key components became so far afield, that supply chain issues ruptured the United States’ ability to build cars. Toledo Solar ran into the shortcomings of this reality last year, when major glass suppliers had cut what they provided by 15% across the board last year.
The variable and rising cost of shipping are relevant here, too. Shortly before the pandemic, Bates said shipping costs were $3,800 for a container, steeply rose to $17 to $18k before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and peaked in the high $20k range afterward. Shipping not only raises the cost of solar projects, reducing their competitive advantage and slowing deployment, but it also lowers the environmental sustainability by using large amounts of fuel to deliver the modules across the globe.
“Everything we source in our supply chain is within a 300 miles radius of our facility,” said Bates.
Emissions and labor
Many opponents of the Department of Commerce’s investigation argued that it should be halted because the supply needs to continue or else the United States will fail to reach its climate-driven decarbonization targets. However, Bates challenged this idea, highlighting that polysilicon-based solar modules have higher carbon intensity than US-made ones, and they are built with much different practices.
The Xinjiang region of China, home to almost 50% of the world’s polysilicon supply chain, is known for the encampment and forced labor of Uyghurs. The Biden Administration passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) to tackle this problem, placing a heavy burden of proof on importers of solar goods to show there is no connection to this region. Transparency is easy for Toledo Solar, as its supply chains and operations are local.
From a climate and emissions perspective, silicon photovoltaics have the largest carbon footprint and longest energy payback period, said Bates. Though China is building massive amounts of solar capacity, the nation also brought online as many as 47 coal plants last year. That’s more coal plants that have been brought online than the rest of the world have retired combined last year. Coal-fired electricity is still part of the panel-making process, and when combined with the shipping emissions, the carbon backpack worn by internationally sourced solar panels is heavier than the ones made locally.
Boosting US-made solar
The manufacturing capacity to fully power the US energy transition is not here yet, but Bates is hopeful that the nation can get there. One action by the Biden Administration he believes will make an impact is the invoking of the Defense Production Act.
“The full use of the DPA is still being looked at,” said Bates. He pointed to the procurement requirements of our roads, bridges, and signs. Everything is standardized and US-made, from the beginning of the supply chain to the end-use. This type of procurement requirement, a “tightening of the belt,” could possibly be used to boost US solar.
Like most in the industry both domestically and internationally, Bates also supports the passing of the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, which would include upfront incentives for materials and components throughout the solar supply chain. Major producers like Maxeon and Qcells have expressed interest in bringing their operations to the US if such legislation passes, which could signal a huge boon for the sustainability and stability of the US solar panel supply going forward.

The new AUD 11 million ($7.6 million) plant includes a production line that can produce panels featuring M10 cell technology and has allowed Tindo to expand its suite of solar modules, with the company recently launching a new 545 W large-format panel for utility-scale solar projects.
The newly commissioned factory has the capacity to produce up to 150 MW of solar panels per annum and is more than three times the size of the company’s previous manufacturing facility.
The release of the video comes after the International Energy International (IEA) earlier this month warned of a need to diversify the world’s solar PV supply chain and expand the production of solar modules, suggesting the sector’s heavy reliance on China has led to imbalances that pose risks to its future growth.

China is the world’s largest solar supplier, dominating not only panel manufacturing but the entire upstream supply chain with a special report from the agency showing the nation controls more than 80% of all the manufacturing stages of solar panels.
When announcing the report, IEA executive director Fatih Birol said China’s dominance of PV supply chains poses specific vulnerability and risks to the industry. “We believe this level of concentration in any global supply chain would represent a significant vulnerability; solar PV is no exception,” he said. “It is a must, in my view, to diversify. Otherwise, we may see major challenges in the days, months and years ahead.”
These challenges have already resulted in delays in solar PV deliveries and higher prices with the report revealing solar panel prices have increased by about 20% over the past year. The imbalance of the solar supply chains has also had a marked effect on Australia’s balance of payments with the nation, which once led the world in developing solar PV technology, now one of the largest importers of PV components.

The IEA said in the past five years solar PV imports have reduced Australia’s trade surplus by 4%. During the same period, Australia ran an average trade deficit on solar panels and associated components of more than AUD 10 billion ($7 billion).
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen has backed the calls for an expansion of Australia’s solar PV manufacturing capacity, saying the nation needs to maximize the benefits of its world-leading research and development.
“The solar panels around the world, the technology that’s in them, in no small part was invented here,” he said last month when announcing the Federal Government’s AUD 45 million extension of funding for the Australia Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics. “That’s something we can be proud of, but we’ve got to take it now to the next step. We’ve put 60 million solar panels on roofs in Australia in the last 10 years. One percent of them have been made in Australia. That’s got to change. This is Australian technology, we want to see more of it made in Australia.”
The IEA estimates diversifying the supply chain could attract more than $170 billion (US$120 billion) of new investment in PV solar manufacturing facilities by 2030.
