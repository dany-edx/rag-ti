According to Rolf Heynen, founding partner of trade show organizer Good! Events & Media, visitor registrations for this week’s show beat the 2019 figures by 10-15%. The large solar solutions hall in Haarlemmermeer, near Schipol Airport in Amsterdam, was filled with exhibitors and visitors as the three-day show kicked off yesterday.
Solar Solutions managed to increase visitor numbers at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic is still keeping the world within its grip because of two factors, according to Heynen: The Dutch PV market has grown considerably, even during the pandemic, adding 10,000 full-time positions to catapult the PV workforce in the Netherlands to just under 29,000; and also, in Heynen’s words: “For many people it’s the first trade show in two-and-a-half years.”
The Dutch market has proven resilient in the face of the pandemic. According to the latest Dutch Solar Trend Report, released this month by Good! Events' sister company Dutch New Energy Research, 3.5 GW of photovoltaic generation capacity was installed in the country last year, expanding the total from around 7 GW at the end of 2019 to 10.7 GW at the end of December. Heynen – who is also CEO of Dutch New Energy Research – said all three market segments developed favorably, supported by a long-standing net-metering scheme for rooftop installations and the attractive, technology-neutral SDE+ and SDE++ auction programs, which are premised on the level of support needed and the amount of CO2 reductions offered. The auction system serves as the main driver for commercial and industrial (C&I) solar projects, while the net-metering rules have driven residential PV to new heights, eclipsing the 1 million-system annual installation mark last year.
Specifically, some 1.1 GW of residential PV was installed in 2020 – around a third of the overall 3.5 GW new solar figure. C&I solar also accounted for about a third of the market, with utility scale PV contributing the rest. The thriving residential market not only accounted for most of the new jobs mentioned by Heynen but also provided the key driver for many exhibitors to book a booth at Solar Solutions this week. Those companies include solar thermal installers and other vendors which stand to benefit from increased PV adoption and electrification, such as suppliers of electric vehicle charging systems, heat pumps, and other electric heating products.
Residential batteries, however, have been hard to find at this week's show, since the national net-metering program largely obviates the need to add battery storage at home. That unusual situation is unlikely to change in the next two years, since the Dutch parliament is keen to keep the net-metering incentive in place at least until 2023. However, a proposed amendment to existing legislation is being discussed which would taper down the net-metering allowance over nine years, to end it in 2031.
While no end to the Dutch residential PV boom appears to be in sight, grid constraints could prove an obstacle for the deployment of large scale solar, whether C&I or utility scale. In fact, as the latest solar trend report revealed, grid conditions show “no” and “very limited” capacity in various Dutch municipalities, especially in the north of the country, where the installation of SDE+ projects is more advanced.
As Heynen observed in an interview on the show floor with pv magazine yesterday, the country’s grid operators have been overly conservative in their projections for solar, leading to a gap between the very aggressive rate of PV adoption and the far slower rate at which the grid has been strengthened to accommodate renewables. Grid companies could argue, however, few could have anticipated the heady growth of Dutch solar in the past five years, with annual growth rates of more than 40% in the last four years, starting with 2016-17 year-on-year growth of 41.4%.
For those who cannot make tomorrow's final day of Solar Solutions International, the 2022 edition will take place in mid-March and promises to have even more exhibitors and visitors as the country continues to surprise on the upside.

The former start-up, which also offers biomass-solar systems which process rice farming waste, today announced it had signed a deal with Nigerian public body the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) to install seven solar-plus-storage mini-grids in the communities of Rukubi, Idada, Igbabo, Kiguna, Akura, Gidan Buba, and Sabon Gida.
Solar could disrupt the fossil fuel industry and help with two of the biggest sustainability challenges of our times: biodiversity loss and food production. Earlier this year, pv magazine’s UP initiative shone a spotlight on agrivoltaics. Read our coverage here.
The systems, to be set up in the local government areas of Doma and Lafia, in Nasarawa state in central Nigeria, will feature battery storage and can also include “a very small amount of diesel … as back-up, on rare occasions,” a spokesperson for the company told pv magazine.
Under the terms of the solar hybrid mini-grid performance-based grant program of the Nigeria electrification project financed by the World Bank and the African Development Bank, Husk will receive grants of $350 per connection and a minimum $10,000 per mini-grid. Based on 5,000 connections, the project would be worth $1.75 million to the developer.
Olu Aruike, Husk Power’s country lead in Nigeria, quoted in the press release, said: “Husk Power’s mission is to rapidly scale the electrification of rural communities and continuously spur economic growth for medium, small, [and] micro enterprises in Nigeria and across sub-Saharan Africa. We are grateful for the leadership and support provided by the REA, and look forward to a long-term partnership in delivering power to all Nigerians.”
The press release issued today by Husk to announce the agreement stated the company had already installed more than 130 mini-grids in India and Tanzania. A company spokesperson said solar-plus-storage systems are better for smaller electric loads, with Husk' biomass-solar systems more appropriate for heavier demand.
This copy was amended on 29/09/21 to reflect Husk is an American, rather than an Indian company, as previously stated.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/29/smart-solution-for-dispatchable-solar/,"SPONSORED,MIDDLE EAST,UNITED ARAB EMIRATES",,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2021",Smart solution for dispatchable solar,"From Huawei 2021 Special Edition
The multi-stage and multifaceted Mohammed bin Rashid (MbR) Solar Park in Dubai has been a trailblazer in many ways. Not only has the vast PV and concentrating solar power (CSP) project set the agenda for large-scale solar deployment in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, but it has also set records for low levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) in the process, while fostering the development of large-scale solar throughout the Middle East.
The eventual 5 GW MbR project has also been at the forefront of solar technological demonstration at scale. Once completed it will be the largest solar project in the world. Over its various stages, the MbR project proponents have deployed thin-film module technologies, dual-glass crystalline silicon modules on single-axis trackers, and bifacial technology.
The 950 MW Phase IV of the MbR Solar Park, being executed by ACWA Power, DEWA, and SRF under the Noor Energy 1 PSC project vehicle, is implementing the only two CSP technologies in the MbR solar park, alongside 250 MW of PV. The project is the world’s largest CSP plant, hosting the world’s tallest central tower. Remarkably, it achieves an LCOE of $0.073/kWh for nonstop dispatchable power, making it “a competitor against unsubsidized fossil fuel generated electricity, generating reliable and dispatchable nonstop clean energy through the day and night,” explains Abdulhameed Al Muhaidib executive director, portfolio management at ACWA Power. The 950 MW project will additionally have 12 to 15 hours of energy storage capacity.
These innovations, along with the most bankable of offtakers and access to flat, easily accessible land, has resulted in MbR project stages regularly setting records for world-beating PPA prices for solar. The 200 MW Phase II of the project set a record with a PPA tariff of $0.0561/kWh. Going further still, the 800 MW Phase III of MbR achieved a strike price of $0.0299/kWh – another world record at the time of financial close in June 2017.
Beyond the module, the MbR Solar Park has utilized innovative power electronics, O&M technologies, such as robotic cleaning, and ownership structures to achieve low prices. The 200 MW Phase II was the first in Dubai to be developed via a public-private partnership. Phase III used 1,500 V architecture and inverters – an early application of higher voltages at the time.
The 250 MW PV component of Phase IV also pushed the boundaries of technology innovation. The plant utilizes bifacial modules, delivering impressive power output with the relatively high albedo from the desert sands.
Phase IV is also pushing the envelope in terms of power electronics and digitization.
“When it comes to the inverter and power stations, Noor Energy 1 is adopting the latest technologies from Huawei’s line of products, consisting mainly of the string inverters and Smart Transformer Stations that allow for a more modular system to be built on a fast-track basis,” says ACWA Power’s Abdulhameed Al Muhaidib.
“As we strive for the best-in-class operations, we are optimizing our land use and leveraging digital tools and robotic solutions to ensure sustainable and reliable energy production throughout the lifetime of the plant.”
The decision by Noor Energy 1 to use Huawei’s string inverters for MbR Phase IV, was based on “lessons” and “past experiences” of the previous stages, says Al Muhaidib. In particular, the environmental conditions – which include extremely high operating temperatures and pervasive, fine dust.
“The main advantage that we see with the use of string inverters is the modularity of the system, which in turn allows for higher availability and less down-time for the plants as a whole,” says Al Muhaidib. “Not only that, but the string inverter brings in the advantage of operating at higher temperature thresholds and utilize cooling systems that require minimum attention and maintenance from the operator side – an advantage that truly shows its value throughout the operation of the plant.”
In terms of digitization, the Huawei power electronics platform, including its transformer station, provides advanced data analytics, delivering insights into the solar field’s operation and maximizing power output, reports the ACWA executive. And with Phase IV of the vast MbR Solar Plant poised to provide power for many hours after the desert sun has set, high performance and digitization will be key.

Sharia-compliant ‘sukuk' bonds were first offered direct to investors last month, via initial public offerings (IPOs) but, following a tepid response, the central bank on Monday said Bangladesh's high street banks could invest their special stock liquidity funds into the instruments.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
When prices on the country's two stock exchanges began to fall, in February last year, the government asked lenders to put aside special funds of up to BDT2 billion ($23 million) each, over and above the amount they are usually permitted to invest in stock. Some 29 banks have thus far taken the opportunity to stockpile BDT35 billion ($402 million) in special funds, with around BDT17 billion already invested on exchanges.
With lenders originally given until January 2025 to invest their special funds, they have now seen that deadline pushed back to December 2028 and been told the cash can be used to purchase sukuk bonds which can finance solar and wind power projects and other renewables.
A senior official at the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission described the decision as a “very encouraging move.”
Dhaka-based conglomerate the Bangladesh Export Import Co Ltd (Beximco) announced in March, it intends to raise almost $400 million worth of Islamic bonds to finance the 200 MW Teesta Solar Limited PV project, in Rangpur district, and the 30 MW Korotoa Solar Limited facility in Panchagarh, both in the north of the country.
Beximco said it would raise $87 million through an IPO, a similar amount from its current backers and the rest from a private placement of shares, with the company's Chinese partners, TBEA Xinjiang Sunoasis Co Ltd and Jiangsu Zhongtian Technology Co Ltd, to also invest in the two solar parks.
Withe the government aiming for 40% of Bangladesh's electricity to come from renewables by mid century, the country currently boasts around 766 MW of clean energy generation capacity.

The project is being developed by the special purpose vehicle ATP Palloneva Oy and is currently under review by the local authorities. “We aim to complete the permitting process during next year or in the first half of 2023, which would enable us to secure financing immediately after that,” Ard de Poot, the owner of Netherlands-based De Vrije Wind B.V., which owns a third of the SPV, told pv magazine. “If all goes well, construction on the plant may start in 2023 and completion may be reached in the following year.”
The consortium, which comprises De Vrije Wind itself and Finnish companies Kaskisten Tuulivoima Oy and Kauhanummi Oy, owned by Jaakko Leppinen and Marko Nummijärvi, respectively, also intends to build a 45 MW wind power plant in the area and to invest a total of €400 million in the two facilities together. “But it will not necessarily be a hybrid project and each plant could inject power to the Seinäjoki-Ulvila power line through separate connections,” De Poot further explained.
The consortium aims to bring more investors on board and to secure power purchase agreements (PPAs) from local utilities and large energy-intensive companies. “Securing one or more PPAs for up to 70% of the project capacity will be crucial for its further development,” De Poot stated, adding that the huge facility may also sell part of the power to the spot market, or use it to produce green hydrogen. “We are considering all options at the moment and storage is also being considered.”
The levelized cost of energy of the project was estimated by De Poot at less than €0.04/kWh. “Large scale solar is becoming competitive with wind in Finland and their LCOEs are now getting closer,” he stated.
The project will be located in a swampy area, which would impose a series of technical requirements to deal with the soft surface. “Marko Nummijärvi is already working on developing cost-effective solutions for both foundation solutions, frame construction, and frame installation,” De Poot added.
The solar park would occupy 500ha of abandoned peatland. “The zoning classification of these peat intake areas is related to industrial activities, the impact of the solar PV and wind project is significantly lower, on any aspect, than the impact of the former peat intake activities,” he also explained. “For example, after construction of the power plant, no longer [will] heavy machinery … be entering and leaving the area, resulting in significantly lower heavy traffic.”

The Stockholm Norvik port which entered service last year claims to run entirely on certified renewable energy and to have all its roofs constructed with solar panels in mind.
Pick up your copy of the September edition of pv magazine today for a detailed update on solar and battery storage in the United States, which faces a tough decision between taking advantage of Asian imports, or developing domestic manufacturing at the risk of slowing progress towards decarbonization.
That rooftop-solar readiness has been borne out by the news the port commissioned a 3,600m2, 605 kW solar array last week.
The port, one of the Ports of Stockholm facilities owned by the city, said the latest array is the fifth installed across its properties and will be able to generate 560 MWh of clean electricity per year, enough to power 25 average detached houses, with all of the solar electricity generated to be consumed on site.
A Ports of Stockholm press release about the project stated the panels were installed by Norrköping-based Idola Solkraft.
Fredrik Lindstål, chair of the board at Ports of Stockholm, quoted in the press release, said: “Ports of Stockholm is continuing to invest in renewable energy in accordance with our long-term environment and climate action plan. Stockholm Norvik Port has now been equipped with a roof-installed solar cell system larger than that of any other Swedish port.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/29/how-much-glass-is-needed-for-terawatt-scale-pv/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2021",How much glass is needed for terawatt-scale PV?,"Researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) have tried to estimate how much float glass the PV industry may need to help the world reach the terawatts of installed solar capacity that will be necessary to reach ambitious climate goals and limit global warming to 1.5 C.
The scientists outlined two different scenarios: a conservative one predicting that the world's cumulative PV capacity will reach 20 TW by 2050 and 80 TW by 2100, and a more optimistic scenario envisaging that global PV capacity will reach 80 TW by 2050 and 170 TW by 2101.
For both scenarios, they considered a maximum CO2 budget of 600 billion tons of carbon dioxide for the 2011-2100 period.
“The two scenarios span a plausible range of values for parameters describing the price learning curve of PV, the size of system integration challenges, the upscaling dynamics of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), and the development of electrification of end-use demands,” they explained.
Depending on the two scenarios, the German group predicts that demand for solar glass could be met by an annual output of between 1,000 km2 and 1,300 km2 in 2020 and between 12,000 km2 and 22,000 km2 by 2100. The scientists assumed solar module efficiency at a learning rate of 6.7%, starting from a module efficiency of 20% in 2020.
“Looking at the total area of the active PV capacity, the values increase from 4,200 to 4,600 km2 in 2020 to 252,000 to 466,000 km2 by 2100,” the group said. “To put this in perspective, the values for 2100 correspond roughly to the land area of the U.K. or Sweden, respectively.”
The researchers expect bifacial glass-glass modules to see their share increase in the upcoming decades and the reduction of glass thickness from 3 mm to 2 mm could help to meet the huge demand triggered by this trend.
“A fully double glass-based PV production will require amounts of float-glass exceeding today's overall annual glass production of 84 Mt as early as 2034 for Scenario 2 and in 2074 for Scenario 1,” they said. “In 2100, glass consumption would reach 122 Mt to 215 Mt.”
Available sand reserves for glass manufacturing do not represent an issue for future glass supply, the academics explained, but the PV and glass industries will have to expand capacities over the coming decades in order to avoid bottlenecks and reduce costs. More importantly, PV module efficiencies will have to improve significantly and reach 24.1% and 25.9% by 2030 for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2.
“This roadmap foresees solar cell efficiencies in the range of 25% for leading products of both n- and p-type products of monocrystalline Si-PV,” they added, noting that no specific technological learning is expected for solar glass.
Emerging technologies such as perovskite solar cells and other cell technologies with efficiencies above 25%, if made commercially mature by the industry, might help to considerably reduce the amount of solar glass needed for the current century.
“Just recently, major commercialization efforts have been announced for thin double glass perovskite module, which would reduce glass demand by an order of magnitude,” the German team said, referring to a roll-to-roll printing technique of perovskite PV on glass developed by New York-based startup Energy Materials Corp.
The scientists presented their findings in “Technological learning for resource efficient terawatt scale photovoltaics,” which was recently published in Energy & Environmental Science. The study also analyzes silver and indium demand, the projected costs of PV, and the greenhouse gas emissions of the solar industry.

The 2019-24 strategic plan of Panama's government includes proposals to make distributed generation (DG) a critical factor in the diversification of the national energy mix. The government has now submitted a preliminary version of the national distributed-generation strategy (ENGED) for public consultation.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that for every million dollars invested in solar distributed generation, 10 jobs are created in the construction phase, as well as one job in the operation and maintenance phase. The government estimates that DG will be able to contribute to the creation of more than 3,000 new jobs by 2030 in the renewable energy sector.
According to the National Public Services Authority (ASEP), as of June 2021 the country had 1,172 distributed-generation PV systems, representing an installed capacity of 46.63 MW.
In order to take into account the different development trajectories of DG, the government has presented three future DG development scenarios for the country – best, worst and middle-case scenarios.
 
The conservative scenario foresees that 7% of electricity generation will come from DG, with an installed capacity of 950 MW.
The strategy includes six lines of action, including the simplification and digitization of procedures for DG projects, an increase in installed capacity limits, the sale or commercialization of surpluses, the regulation of remote facilities, the modification of self-consumption, the expansion of limits, and the evaluation, adaptation and implementation of technical standards.
To calculate the market potential of self-consumption systems in Panama, two types of potential have been outlined. The authorities have considered technical potential, dependent solely on the natural characteristics of the site and the self-consumption potential of current customers. They have also looked at the technical-economic potential, which is determined by the number of facilities that are currently economically viable. The government conducted this analysis for each consumer segment – residential, commercial and government, and industrial – as they have different consumption patterns.
The current technical potential (2020) for the installation of self-consumption systems in Panama at the national level is 863,700 installations and 3,851 MWp. This would generate 5.29 TWh per year of distributed electrical energy, which is equivalent to 57% of the energy purchased by distributors in 2019.
The current technical-economic potential for the installation of self-consumption systems in Panama is estimated at a national total of 137,800 installations for 1,453 MWp, as of June 2020. This number of systems would generate, on average, 2.0 TWh per year of distributed electrical energy.

The BIPV installation was developed with monocrystalline solar tiles provided by Swiss manufacturer 3S Solar Plus. The product is available in different gradations of green, blue, terracotta and brown and has a power output ranging from 80 to 170 W, depending on color and size. The short-circuit current ranges from 6.5 to 7.5 A and the open-circuit voltage from 13.3 to 22.3 V.

The size of the panel can vary from 985x720x6.5mm to 1,300x875x6.5mm, and the number of solar cells from 24 to 40. The weight ranges from 10.3 to 16.3kg. The product comes with a 10-year product warranty and a 25-year performance warranty. Its operating temperature coefficient is -0.375% per degree Celsius.
“The tile color ‘terracotta rust’ is just one of many available with MegaSlate Flair,” said 3S Solar Plus CEO, Patrick Hofer-Noser. “Even complex roof shapes are not a problem. We take measurements on-site, and then the roof is totally covered in no time at all.”
The solar tile is said to be an ideal solution for protected historic buildings and the PV system in Zurich is claimed to be the largest colored rooftop PV system in Europe.

Switzerland-based Meyer Burger said it plans to set up a production facility to manufacture heterojunction solar modules in the United States.
The facility’s initial production capacity will be 400 MW, with the potential to grow to multiple gigawatts of capacity. Its startup capacity will include capabilities to manufacture solar modules for residential, commercial/industrial rooftop, and utility-scale applications. Production is expected to begin by the end of 2022, and the facility could create hundreds of jobs.
While a final site has yet to be determined, the company said it made the expansion decision as part of its commitments to produce modules near its customers and source material from regional suppliers. It also said it aims to improve overall sustainability by reducing transportation emissions and optimizing the carbon footprint of its solar modules.
The president of Meyer Burger Americas, Ardes Johnson, said it is critical for the United States to develop its domestic supply chain and derisk itself from heavy dependence on Asia-based equipment suppliers. With supply chain concerns and shipping delays becoming a paramount issue for the solar industry, this approach could ease delivery delays or constraints and provide flexibility for customers.
Meyer Burger said it expects to have a site selected by the end the year. It said its key criteria will include available facilities, regulatory and tax frameworks, state and local economic development programs, access to a skilled workforce, proximity to transportation infrastructure, renewable power supplies, and local commitments.
By the end of 2022, the company wants to increase its solar cell production capacity in Bitterfeld. Germany, from 400 MW today to 1.4 GW. At its second German factory, in Freiberg, a total module capacity of 1 GW is expected to be reached by the end of next year, from 400 MW at present. Both of the German plants only went into operation a few months ago.

Described in the paper Defect detection system for silicon solar panels under all-day irradiation, which was recently published in Applied Optics, the novel technique consists of combining software that applies a modulated electric current to the PV panels and an indium-gallium-arsenide (InGaAs) photodiode detector that takes a sequence of images of the panels.
“Today’s defect detection systems can only be used to find defects at night or on solar panel modules that have been removed and moved inside or into a shaded environment,” researcher Yunsheng Qian stated.
Furthermore, the system includes a filter that is able to limit the detected wavelengths detected to around 1,150nm and to remove some of the stray sunlight from the images. “Using these image data as data sources, a defect display algorithm model is designed,” the researchers explained.

“The very fast imaging speed allows more images to be collected so that a greater number of changes between images can be distinguished,” said Sheng Wu, the paper's main author. “The key development was a new algorithm that distinguishes the modulated and unmodulated parts of the image sequence and then magnifies this difference.”
The technique was tested on several mono and polycrystalline panels and the Chinese group claims it was able to detect faults on modules with irradiances from 0 to 1,300 W/m2, which it said equates to light conditions ranging from complete darkness to full sunlight. “The results show that this algorithm can reduce background interference in an effective way and improve the contrast of defects displayed under high irradiance.”
Looking forward, the research team is planning to develop software to reduce digital noise and improve image quality, so that the detector can collect image changes more accurately. The academics also want to see if artificial intelligence could be applied to the acquired images to automatically identify the types of defects, and further streamline the inspection process.

The findings of an investigation into a fire that broke out during the commissioning of Australia’s biggest battery have finally been released, with the most likely root cause deemed to be a leak within its Tesla Megapack cooling system.
The blaze at the Neoen-owned 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery – one of the largest battery energy storage systems in the world – unsurprisingly led to renewed global discussions around the safety of lithium-ion battery technologies. The multi-party independent investigation into the fire showed that the system in place to detect faults didn’t set off alarms because it hadn’t been given adequate time to “map” the control system, which generally takes around 24 hours. The Megapack that caught fire was switched to offline mode after just 13 hours in service, meaning that the protection systems which should have been operating and providing oversight did not do so.
“The cause of the fire was identified as coinciding short circuits in two particular locations likely initiated by a coolant leak external to the battery compartment,” Energy Safe Victoria said in a statement published this week. “Enabled by this unlikely sequence of events the fault was able to go undetected and initiate a fire in the adjacent battery compartment. Mitigating actions have been put in place at the facility and across Tesla’s global Megapack fleet, including a combination of firmware enhancements, as well as monitoring and process improvements.”
Following the conclusion of the investigations, which additionally involved the Country Fire Authority, WorkSafe Victoria, and the Environment Protection Authority, the regulatory authorities have provided Neoen and Tesla with approval to resume energization testing from Sept. 29.
Action list
In regard to the Victorian Big Battery fire, the following actions have been enforced:
Designers are also working to ensure that Megapacks are engineered to fully mitigate the risk of fire propagation from one unit to another under Victorian climatic conditions, with proposed mitigation procedures to be rolled out to applicable Megapacks globally.
The issue of large-scale battery performance and safety will be a key topic at pv magazine’s upcoming Insight Australia event, which will include a case study of the Victoria blaze.

Based on an entirely new architecture, the DS3 inverter is available in three versions with power outputs of 730, 880, and 960 VA. “The DS3 series is designed to be paired with virtually any choice of PV module type and size, including 60 and 72-cell modules, 120 and 144-split-cell modules, as well as bifacial modules,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The device has a size of 262x218x41.2mm and a weight of 2.6kg. It features an efficiency of 97% and a California Energy Commission (CEC) efficiency of 96.5%.
The new product relies on two input channels with independent MPPT and its nominal MPPT efficiency is 99.5%. It also features standard MC4 connectors with an IP67 enclosure rating.
“The inverter is built with 20% fewer components and offers reduced logistics costs, faster installation, improved communication, and connection features,” APsystems stated, noting that the device is also compatible with its QS1 and YC600 microinverters, as well as ECU-R, ECU-C and ECU-B gateway devices.
The inverter will be sold starting from the fourth quarter of this year and is being showcased at Solar Solutions International, which is currently being held in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands.

Sascha Rossmann: Currently we are focusing on the M6 (166 mm) wafer. Going into next year, we will be migrating to the M10 (182 mm). In terms of power that will mean roughly 400-410 watts on the 60 cell format and 500-550 on the 72 cell format. We don’t see as much innovation in cell technology these days, it’s all about wafer size and cost reduction. If you really want to increase efficiency, you have to go to double or even triple-junction cells, and this is still a long way off.
Absolutely, you need to change the whole production line. The stringers and all the layup for the solar cells need to be upgraded. And you also need higher levels of automation because the alignment of the cells needs to be even more precise with much narrower gaps. This is a challenge for a lot of smaller manufacturers.

Marc Ortmanns: On the market side, when we look at the rooftop segment in particular there is a bit of a conflict of interest. On the one hand, there are manufacturers who want to bring costs down and see larger formats as an effective way to do this. On the other, you have the rooftop PV installers, all of whom prefer smaller dimensions. I think the 400-410 W panels with dimensions of 1.709 x 1.135 mm are a good fit, anything larger simply isn’t practical to install on a rooftop.
Our customers focus very much on private and small commercial PV installations – the average system size that we ship is around 15-20 kW. So size is a key criterion, that is in contrast with many of the larger Asian manufacturers and OEM suppliers that focus on PV modules for large-scale projects. While shifting to the M10 we are still trying to keep the panel as small as possible to be the best fit for European rooftops.
SR: We are working on that, but we don’t have a concrete product yet. Two or three years down the line we expect to see a major migration to n-type, once this current move to larger wafer sizes has run its course. And within n-type, we see that TOPCon is the lowest cost option, but we have found that if you really want to see a significant efficiency increase you have to look at heterojunction. In combination with back contact this will bring module efficiencies up to the 23% mark.
SR: We are working on rapid shutdown (RSD) technology, with some demonstration systems already set up in Taiwan. We have developed our own microchip to control the junction box, leveraging our production base in Taiwan and the island’s leading position in the semiconductor industry. We are testing it in Taiwan as well, because we expect to see a tightening of RSD regulations here, given the high ambient temperatures and the very expensive buildings where solar is being installed: If you install a PV system on a US$10 billion factory, you don’t want that system to cause a fire. And with so many high-tech, expensive factories in Taiwan the government is considering stipulations for RSD.
Currently, RSD is usually managed by the inverter, but by integrating it at the module level we offer customers more flexibility. It’s a valuable additional function for the rooftop market, and you have to develop a whole printed circuit board with all the technical signaling and so on, which is not easy to do.
MO: For us, it’s still Europe. That’s where we started back in 2008, and it’s still our major market, with 50-60% of our capacity being sold in Europe. We have a strong, loyal customer base here, and they appreciate that we have maintained a stable presence in the market for years, with a continuous team, never changing our approach. We have our strongest base in Germany, and we have been expanding into other European regions, for example, BeNeLux, Scandinavia, Poland, and Italy. Outside of Europe, we are strong in Australia, Japan, the United States, and of course Taiwan as well.
SR: In all of these regions we are focused on residential and commercial markets. We have a few megawatt-sized systems but that is quite rare. As a manufacturer, we are very much a niche player, not just from a capacity standpoint but also from our portfolio. We target a narrow group of installers that focus on this private sector. In this segment, we see that the growing ‘green wave’ toward storage and electric vehicles has created a lot of new demand and also a whole new way of selling.
MO: In the past, the panel was the main topic that the end-user was interested in. Now the storage solution is key, and the panel has become just a part of the whole system that is driven, marketing and sales-wise, by the storage solutions. To promote yourself as a PV panel manufacturer in this space, the softer skills of forming long-term customer bonds and being reliable in terms of quality, service, warranty handling, and these other relationship aspects become more important.  This is a strategy that we first started with more than 12 years ago, and the way we take care of the relationships on the installer side today.
