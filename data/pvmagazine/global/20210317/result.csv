The Polish experts expect that new PV systems with a combined capacity of 2.15 GW will be deployed in the country this year and predict another 1.98 GW for 2022. Furthermore, they forecast a newly installed capacity of 2.48 GW, 1.9 GW, and 2.39 GW for the following three years.
By the end of 2025, the country should have reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 14.93 GW. In a previous report, published in June, the IEO had predicted Poland would have reached just 7.8 GW of solar by 2025.
According to the latest statistics from Polish grid operator Polskie Sieci Elektroenergetyczne (PSE), Poland reached 4.08 GW of installed solar capacity at the end of January.
The IEO experts explained that in 2021 the share of distributed solar and utility scale PV plants will be almost equal, and that in the following two years the share of solar parks will increase as more projects selected in public tenders will come online. “The PV market will change from the current prosumer character to sustainable between professional PV power plants and prosumers, including industrial one[s],” they explained.
The research institute has revealed, last month, that PV projects with a combined capacity of 4.4 GW secured preliminary grid-connection approval last year, which shows the increasing interest for large scale solar among Polish and international investors.
The country has also seen its first two power purchase agreements being secured for big solar plants in recent times. Poland's second-largest coal power provider, Zespół Elektrowni Pątnów-Adamów-Konin SA (ZE PAK SA), secured, this week, a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) for a 70 MW solar plant it is planning to build in Brudzew, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in western-central Poland. Moreover, German developer Baywa re in January secured a PPA for the 64.6 MWp Witnica solar park which is set to come online between Poznań and Berlin by July.

The commission yesterday announced it had opened an antitrust investigation into the state-owned power company, and said the alleged conduct, if proven, may have slowed green energy investment.
Margrethe Vestager, the commission executive vice president in charge of competition policy, said yesterday: “We all rely on well-functioning electricity markets. Today we are launching an investigation of PPC's behavior in wholesale electricity markets in Greece, that might have distorted competition and slowed down investment into the generation of greener energy. Greece has recently embarked on an ambitious plan to exit from lignite. Ensuring effective competition is the best way to deliver competitively priced electricity, both for citizens and businesses, as well as to stimulate investment in less polluting energy sources.”
PPC, which is majority owned by the Greek government, is said to hold more than two-thirds of the market for supplying electricity to retail and business customers and owns all of the nation's lignite and hydropower plants, as well as some natural gas and clean power assets.

It added that it could not have predicted the rising polysilicon price and supply shortage that resulted from explosions and floods at poly suppliers last year or that Covid-19 would prompt a rise in selling costs.
Furthermore, the board said the loss is anticipated despite shipment volumes rising 65% from the 4,134 MW of product shifted in 2019 to 6,811 MW in 2020. Revenues also rose last year, up 37% from 2019, from RMB4.43 billion ($681 million) to RMB6.05 billion.
The fact the expected annual loss will be 40% lower than the figure shed in 2019 may not be sufficient to stifle criticism of the directors.
Solargiga will present its annual figures on the last day of the month, along with fellow solar manufacturer Shunfeng and polysilicon maker Xinte Energy.

Their special technique consists of a holographic film, based on prismatic concentrators known as “prismacons,” which are made of a transparent material containing holographic lenses of infinitely small dimensions.
“The internal structure of the holographic film is made in the form of miniature pyramids – prismatic concentrators able to effectively capture light rays and, due to their multiple reflection inside the prisms, concentrate on the surface of the solar module,” said researcher Irina Kirpichnikova.

The holographic film was covered with an ultra-thin layer made of unspecified rare earth metals, which purportedly reflect infrared radiation and transmit visible radiation.
“The working principle of a holographic film lies in the fact that the rays of sun hit the surface of the module, while part of the spectrum – the infrared rays – is reflected from the metalized top layer of the film, preventing the module from overheating,” Kirpichnikova explained. “The visible part of the solar radiation spectrum hits the pyramidal structure of the concentrators, and, being repeatedly refracted in them, due to internal reflection, concentrates on the solar cell, regardless of the angle of incidence of the rays on the solar module.”
The low-cost solution is purportedly applicable to all kinds of solar panels, including thermal-photovoltaic devices.
“This solution increases the efficiency of solar modules even in cloudy weather,” Kirpichnikova said, adding that the technique enables variations in the direction of the light rays.
Holographic films are very thin, flexible plastic films that can be laminated onto different types of materials. They can diffract the usable frequencies of sunlight and direct the generated energy toward the solar cells. Their application in PV research is not new, as several kinds of holographic foils and patterns have already been tested in both PV and CPV devices. However, the technology has not been developed for commercial production thus far.

With solar at the heart of Japan's energy transition, according to a paper commissioned by domestic thinktank the Renewable Energy Institute, more than a third of the 524 GW of solar generation capacity needed by 2045 would be installed on urban rooftops.
The scale of the challenge is represented by the fact researchers from Finland's LUT University; the Japanese thinktank; and German peer Agora Energiewende insisted Japan would have to install the maximum volume of solar project capacity possible, occupying 1.3% of the total free land area available today with utility scale PV plants.
The route to net zero by mid century will require Japan to raise the 18% of its energy mix accounted for by renewables in 2019 to at least 40% by 2030, helping drive a 45% fall in the volume of greenhouse gas emissions at that date–compared with 2010 figures–and a 90% reduction by 2045, at which point imported synthetic hydrogen and methane could complete the goal in the hardest-to-decarbonize industrial sectors.
Japan is not as far down the emissions reduction track as the EU and, with its power sector still offering the biggest carbon saving potential, the authors of the Renewable pathways to climate-neutral Japan study suggested 8.4 GW of solar should be installed annually, to hit 144 GW this decade, including 70 GW of household systems, up from 23 GW last year. Japan added more solar annually–8.5 GW–in the 2014-19 period.
If that new solar target sounds achievable, the requirements of 2031-45 modeled by the researchers called for 25 GW of new solar each year, to attain that 524 GW figure.
Photovoltaics are slated to be the energy transition workhorse based on an expectation the cost of generating solar electricity will fall to an average ¥3.90/kWh ($0.036) by 2050. The ¥17.4 trillion ($159 billion) annual cost of the energy system modeled would be significantly lower than the current ¥24.7 trillion and a renewable energy mix would see only ¥3.8 trillion ($34.8 billion) spent on imports–of synthetic fuels–compared to the ¥17 trillion lavished on fossil fuel imports today.
With governments around the world being urged to formulate green hydrogen strategies, the Renewable Energy Institute-commissioned paper is notable for emphasizing the energy needs of Japan should steer the nation towards the electrification of sectors such as heating, transport and most of its industry, and should keep hydrogen use to a minimum. According to the authors, the wind power capacity required to fuel the domestic production of green hydrogen would place too great a strain on the energy system, so the sustainable gas should be imported and used only in the few sectors where it would constitute the only alternative to fossil fuel dependency.
The report's authors suggest the Japanese government should enshrine its suggested renewables capacity mix figures into concrete climate change targets; phase out coal by 2030–with economics ensuring nuclear falls away by the same point; encourage rapid heat pump and electric vehicle adoption; and apply strict energy efficiency standards in its building codes.

(HPX), has unveiled a plan to build a gigafactory for the production of vanadium redox flow batteries in China.
The company said it has signed a framework agreement for the 1 GW project with the government of Xiangyang–a prefecture-level city in northwestern Hubei province; and Chinese investment firm Xiangyang High-tech State-owned Capital Investment and Operation Group.
The agreement includes the setting up of an R&D facility and the development and construction of a 100 MW solar plant linked to a 100 MW/500 MWh vanadium flow battery in Xiangyang. “VRB Energy’s 100 MW project in Hubei is among a growing number of 100 MW flow battery projects being prioritized in China as part of its national energy storage policy and accelerated infrastructure investment in support of post-Covid economic growth,” the manufacturer said.
The construction of the factory is expected to be started by May. “This project is a massive catalyst for VRB Energy’s global growth and further demonstrates that we are developing the absolute best technologies to support the worldwide green energy revolution,” said the company's CEO, Robert Friedland.
VRB Energy claims its vanadium redox flow storage systems rely on low-cost ion-exchange membrane and bipole material, and long-life electrolyte formulation. The standard battery power module is rated at 250 kW for megawatt-class systems. The modules, according to the company, are combined with electrolyte storage tanks and power conversion systems to form systems from 250 kW/1 MWh up. VRB Energy also claims the device can go through an almost unlimited number of charge and discharge cycles for over 25 years.

The panel was built by connecting seven solar cells in series with an efficiency of 16.71%. Laser-based P1, P2, and P3 scribes were used to connect the anode of a cell to the cathode of the subsequent cell. The cells were then placed on patterned indium tin oxide-coated glass substrates and were spin-coated with zinc oxide (ZnO) precursor solution at 200 C for an hour in the air.
The scientists developed the panel with a quaternary approach by using a commercially available polymer, PM6, and a fullerene electron acceptor known as PC71BM, which is commonly used in the most efficient organic photovoltaic devices. They also used two non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) known as Y6 and ITIC, which have both been applied in previous research on organic PV.
“The PC71BM was added as the third component in the PM6:Y6 system to optimize the charge transport,” the academics said. “The ITIC was further added as the fourth component to maximize the photon harvesting.”
The addition of PC71BM and ITIC to the binary PM6:Y6 blend creates more donor/acceptor interfaces and favors exciton dissociation and charge transport, which results in an increased short-circuit current.
The module, which measures 19.34 cm2, with a geometrical filling factor of 95.5%, has a certified efficiency of 12.36%, an open-circuit voltage of 6.06 V, a short circuit current of 3.07 mA⋅cm−2, and a fill factor of 66.45%.
At an experimental level, the scientists were also able to increase the device's efficiency by 0.89% and achieved an open-circuit voltage of 6.024 V, a short circuit current of 3.11 mA⋅cm−2, and a fill factor of 70.7%. This efficiency is purportedly the highest value for an inverted large-area module to date.
“The excellent performance of photovoltaic devices and large-area modules proves the synergy of multiple components, paving a way to the commercial application of the high-performance photovoltaic cells,” the researchers concluded.
They described the module in “19.34 cm2 large-area quaternary organic photovoltaic module with 12.36% certified efficiency,” which was recently published in Photonics Research.

German chemical group and polysilicon manufacturer Wacker Chemie has reported 2% revenue growth for its polysilicon business in 2020.
The company posted overall revenue growth of 5%, to €4.69 billion last year. In the second quarter, sales fell significantly due to the Covid-19 crisis. In the third and fourth quarters this was partially offset, thanks, in particular, to good demand for polysilicon and from the construction industry. In addition to the overall lower prices and sales volumes, year-on-year, product-mix effects and currency changes also slowed sales development, the company said.
EBITDA reached €666.3 million in the last financial year–a decrease of 15% compared to 2019. The company was also able to swing from an EBIT loss of €536.3 million in 2019 to a profit of €262.8 million last year. Depreciation of €760 million, associated with its polysilicon business, was included in the financial results for 2019. In 2020, depreciation totaled just over €400 million.
According to the balance sheet, sales in the Wacker polysilicon division increased by 2%, to €792.2 million last year. The main reasons for this were higher sales volumes and a better product mix. Segment EBITDA was 92% higher than in 2019, at €4.7 million. However, adjusted for insurance benefits–which were incurred as special income in 2019–it rose by as much as €60.3 million. This was mainly due to further improvements in manufacturing costs.
“In the polysilicon business, we are also assuming slightly higher sales volumes and a better product mix,” said Wacker Chemie CEO Rudolf Staudigl. “The annual average prices for polysilicon are unlikely to decrease compared to 2020.” In view of the strong growth in volumes and prices in the photovoltaic sector in recent weeks, the increase in sales could also be in the low double-digit percentage range, according to Staudigl. EBITDA will be significantly higher than the previous year.
Looking forward, Wacker Chemie said its EBITDA will grow by between 10 and 20% this year, as a result of savings in material and personnel costs. For the first quarter at least, Wacker Chemie is already recording dynamic demand growth in all business areas.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/17/overlooked-supply-chain-enters-australias-green-hydrogen-export-mix/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 17, 2021",Overlooked supply chain enters Australia’s green hydrogen export mix,"From pv magazine Australia
Compressed hydrogen has received little airtime in the future fuels global frenzy, especially in Australia. Determined to remain a global energy provider by switching exports from brown to green, Australia is infatuated with the question of how to get its hydrogen to the jaws of a hungry global market.
Viewed from this angle, liquefied hydrogen–which involves cooling the loose hydrogen gas until it tenses up and becomes a liquid–looks far more attractive, as you can fit five times more of the shrunken molecule in a vessel. Ammonia, which is composed of one nitrogen atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms, is sexier yet–boasting a density of seven times hydrogen gas. “It all comes down to how much you can make and get to your market. That’s what I think is front-of-mind,” Scott Hamilton, senior advisor and consultant at the Smart Energy Council, told pv magazine Australia.
While attention has fixated on hydrogen’s thicker cousins, Western Australia company Global Energy Ventures (GEV) viewed the issue of transport from its own unique lens. Having spent four years designing a ship to transport compressed natural gas, the company’s dozen employees figured: ‘why not apply the same principles for hydrogen?'
GEV released its design for a vessel which would not only transport, but also run on, compressed hydrogen in November of 2020. It then went a step further, commissioning GHD Advisory to undertake a scoping study weighing up compressed hydrogen against ammonia and liquid hydrogen as an end-to-end zero-emissions supply chain. To industry surprise, compressed hydrogen emerged far from the ‘Plain Jane' it had initially seemed.
While the company’s clearest offering is its ship design, it is urging the industry to take a broader perspective when it comes to compressed hydrogen. “This is about the end-to-end supply chain, not just the ship,” said Global Energy Ventures executive director Martin Carolan.
The scoping study found compressed hydrogen to be “extremely competitive” when shipped at less than 2,000 nautical miles. Compressed hydrogen remained competitive compared to ammonia and liquefied hydrogen when transported at distances of up to 4,500 nautical miles–roughly the distance between the northern half of Australia and Southeast Asia.
“That was a revelation for the industry because no one had ever thought that compression, from a shipping perspective, would be in the mix for that distance,” Carolan told pv magazine Australia.
“We’re not trying to dismiss the alternatives. Overall, in the next 10 years I think everyone can get there … the point is that the simplicity and efficiency of our [supply chain] should be considered.”
The crux of the case rests on speed. Compressed hydrogen’s key advantage is that the gas lines and infrastructure used to load and unload compressed natural gas can be repurposed to carry hydrogen.
“That’s why we talk about minimal technical barriers,” said Carolan. “We just need to [get approvals for] the ship. The other components in our supply chain will be there and ready to go.”
Of course, the re-purposing isn’t quite that easy. Traditional gas lines can only carry a blended gas that is up to 15% hydrogen. And for the SEC’s Scott Hamilton, the rosy picture comes with a caveat.
“There’s quite a lot of debate about whether we should be encouraging the injection of renewable hydrogen into existing gas networks,” he told pv magazine Australia. “When we look at the idea of injecting the gas [hydrogen] into existing pipelines, we need to be very cognizant… to make sure we have excellent leak protection and repair systems and processes in place to make sure that we’re not inadvertently causing a major problem.”
Be that as it may, Hamilton is pro re-purposing, at least in the meantime. “I’m encouraging doing that as a short term measure. In the longer term, we’re going to need purpose-built infrastructure and pipelines.”
This infrastructure leg-up is vital. Carolan estimates it would be possible to get a compressed hydrogen supply chain to be up and running in just three to five years. On the other hand, some estimates place commercial liquid hydrogen and ammonia supply chains a decade away.
The reason for that is that we simply don’t yet have all the technology needed to make liquid hydrogen commercially viable, or the ammonia supply chain with zero emissions. “There’s still technical advances needed there,” Carolan said.
Liquid hydrogen needs to be stored at -253 degrees Celsius to remain liquid–no easy feat. Likewise, because ammonia throws a nitrogen atom into its hydrogen mix, customers wanting pure hydrogen will need to ‘crack’ their ammonia at the end of its global journey, essentially snapping the molecule apart.
Transporting a liquid at -253 degrees Celsius across the world and cracking ammonia molecules are both, at this point in time, not technically possible at scale. Neither Carolan nor Hamilton believes the problems are unsolvable, the question is just what time and cost.
Likewise, while the density of ammonia and liquid hydrogen make them more attractive for transport, the characteristic comes at a price: embedded energy.
Unsurprisingly, it takes a lot of energy to shrink molecules and to crack them apart. If the aim of the game is a completely zero-emissions supply chain, Carolan argues ammonia and liquid hydrogen are both on the back foot.
Scott Hamilton is less worried by these elements. He thinks the technical hurdles to commercializing green hydrogen supply chains can, and will, happen “quicker than expected.”
“Similar to how we’ve underestimated how quickly the cost of solar, wind and now batteries would drop, I think we’ll now see the cost of electrolysis, liquefaction also drop,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean there’s not going to be timing and sequencing issues, and it doesn’t mean there’s not going to be a role for different forms and types of hydrogen.”
For Hamilton, green hydrogen’s formational journey is less a story of dogged competition than one of multiple pathways.
“We have to let the 1,000 green hydrogen roses bloom to see what is going to make the best. I think everyone is going to have a view on this, and I really encourage that. What we’ve really got to do is get these projects happening and get this occurring so we can find out.”
With green hydrogen markets expected to grow tenfold in the coming decades, both Hamilton and Carolan believe there will likely be room for the market to accommodate multiple forms.
“I think there’s going to be various markets and demands for renewable hydrogen in different forms,” Hamilton said. “It’s likely to be an ‘and’ not an ‘or.’”

Carolan says he’s been in discussions with a number of European companies which are exploring the possibility of producing green hydrogen on offshore wind platforms when there is extra capacity available. While not far from shore, the green hydrogen will still need to find its way to land.
“There will be instances where a pipeline will work, and instances where a pipeline will not work. So what’s the alternative? We think that compression is ideally suited to that part of the world, with much shorter distances.”
Carolan proposes that it would be quicker and easier for these companies to compress hydrogen and let GEV’s ships ferry it a few hours to shore, instead of undergoing the more burdensome processes of turning the hydrogen into liquid or ammonia, only to shift it back into gas a few hours later.
“It just doesn’t make sense to us that you would run through such extensive chemical capital and energy-inefficient processes just to move the energy source from A to B.”
Yet the supply chain isn’t limited to short distances, Carolan insists. Buoyed by the results of the scoping study, Carolan has his eyes firmly on Southeast Asian markets for GEV’s green hydrogen.
“It’s really not clear how big the market is, but we know that, within a regional context, if it’s, today, a 10 million ton market, then it’s going to grow tenfold.” Global Energy Ventures is keen to get a piece of the pie and is confident it will be able to deliver the green hydrogen countries like Japan, South Korea and Singapore want more quickly and easily, than the projects which are only looking at liquid and ammonia supply chains will. “We’re a three to five-year scenario for having our ship ready.”
While the Smart Energy Council is as excited as anyone about the potential for Australia’s green hydrogen export market, Hamilton noted decarbonizing global shipping alone would be a jackpot for well-positioned companies.
“That’s a huge opportunity for Australia and for companies like [Global Energy Ventures] to be involved in.” As he pointed out, experts expect US$1.9 trillion worth of investment will be needed to decarbonize shipping by 2050.
“I’m happy to be collaborating with these guys, I think they’re really doing some very exciting work in terms of the development of these new technologies,” Hamilton added.
This type of collaboration–or, more specifically, partnership–is precisely what Global Energy Ventures needs to proceed to the next stages of its proposal.
After it revealed the designs for its compressed hydrogen vessel less than six months ago, Global Energy Ventures was approached by fuel-cell manufacturer Ballard Power Systems. “It really solidified for us that we were on the right track,” Carolan said. The two companies are now formally working together to get the ship’s propulsion to be as efficient as possible.
The Western Australia company is yet to sign any agreements with partners in the two other areas it seeks them–namely in the form of Australian green hydrogen production projects and end users.
It is looking to make a deal with a production project located anywhere between the mid-west of Western Australia and Gladstone, in Queensland–including all of the Northern Territory–sometime this year.
The ultimate goal there is to partner with a project that would create at least 30,000 tons of green hydrogen annually, which is what the company believes would be the scale required to warrant the construction of three demonstration ships which it would use to prove–then hopefully commercialize–its compressed hydrogen supply chain.

The investment was made through a Series A financing round that also saw the participation of Netherlands-based sustainable energy innovation engine EIT InnoEnergy and the German development finance institution Deutsche Investitions und Entwicklungsgesellschaft (DEG) subsidiary of German state-owned development lender KfW Group.
Solarworx intends to use the raised capital to expand its product portfolio and sales activities. It currently offers the off-grid photovoltaic solution Solego, which comes with a battery storage system with a capacity of 80 or 160 watt-hours.
The Berlin-based start-up wants to achieve its overarching goal of providing a secure supply of solar power to around 1.2 billion people worldwide without access to the power grid. The off-grid solutions are compatible with all important “pay-as-you-go” payment platforms.
Solarworx sees additional market potential in its direct-current network solution MESH, which is a hardware-independent system that is claimed to be able to distribute solar power to between two and 100 households and small and medium-sized companies. The plan is to launch the product in a pre-commercial stage in the second quarter of the year.
“In Africa, everything is defined by price,” said Solarworx founder Felix Boldt. “Our solution cuts out the need for technicians and can be customized to accommodate individual power demands and available budgets.”
The current core markets for the company are Cameroon, Zambia and Nigeria. Canadian Solar's strong network in Africa, consisting of suppliers, sales channels and logistics, is expected to help Solarworx to further reduce its costs.

The main goal of the agreements is to supply renewable energy for the electric-vehicle value chain. The companies also aim to develop a public charging infrastructure network and build up to six gigafactories in Europe.
In Volkswagen's alliance with Iberdrola, the automaker will source around 1.5 TWh/year of renewable energy for its facilities on the Iberian Peninsula. The agreement is equivalent to one-third of Madrid's total energy consumption.
The alliance, which can be extended to other countries, also includes plans to supply energy with guarantees of renewable origin (GdO), as well as other energy solutions for Volkswagen's final customers and its network of concessionaires.
In addition, Volkswagen and its partners plan to establish up to six battery gigafactories in Europe by the end of this decade, with a total production capacity of 240 GWh. The first two factories will operate in the Swedish city of Skellefteå and in Salzgitter, Germany.
In response to growing demand, Volkswagen has also decided to change an earlier plan related to cell production, so it can concentrate production of its premium cells at the Northvolt Ett gigafactory in Skellefteå, in collaboration with Northvolt. The production of these cells will start in 2023 and will gradually expand until the companies reach an annual capacity of up to 40 GWh.
Volkswagen's operational gigafactory in Salzgitter, Germany, will produce cells from 2025. It is also planning to set up 40 GWh of annual production capacity in Salzgitter.
“This reorientation will provide greater economies of scale and reduce the complexity of production,” the group said.
The facilities will be powered by electricity from renewable sources. Volkswagen said that it is now considering potential partners and sites for the factories. Together with its partners, it also aims to operate 18,000 public fast-charging points across Europe by 2025. This represents a fivefold increase in its fast-charging network by 2025.
Volkswagen said that the rollout will be done through a number of strategic partnerships, in addition to its joint venture with Ionity. The company wants to establish 8,000 fast charging points across Europe together with BP. They will install fast chargers with a charging capacity of 150 kW at 4,000 BP and ARAL service stations in Germany and Great Britain.
In collaboration with Iberdrola, Volkswagen will also cover the main traffic routes in Spain. In Italy, the German automaker will collaborate with Enel to establish a fast-charging network both on motorways and in urban areas.
Volkswagen will invest around €400 million ($476 million) in the entire European program by 2025. It will make other investments via external partners. In addition, the automaker is expanding its public fast-charging network in the United States and China.

Care Ratings analysts estimate that solar power tariffs could rise by about 20% as a basic customs duty goes into effect from April 1, 2022. 
Solar cell and module imports from China, Thailand, and Vietnam are currently subject to a 14.50% safeguard duty, which is due to expire on July 30. While there is some ambiguity around the extension of the safeguard duty, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has confirmed that the Ministry of Finance has approved the proposal to levy a 40% customs duty on solar modules, and 25% on cells, from April 2022. The solar electricity price in India dropped to an all-time low of INR 1.99 ($0.027)/kWh in a 500 MW Gujarat auction held in December.
The proposed basic customs duty structure will be applicable without grandfathering bid-out projects. Accordingly, scheduled projects that are not commissioned by March 31, 2022, would not be entitled to change-in-law compensation. This could directly impact the returns and debt-servicing capability of such projects, according to Care Ratings.
Projects scheduled for commissioning after April 1, 2022, will be eligible for change-in-law compensation, but this has always been a lengthy process. This will also increase power costs for offtakers.
