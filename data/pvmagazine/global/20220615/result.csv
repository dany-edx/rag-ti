On June 5, the Biden administration announced a 24-month tariff exemption on solar modules manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. 
The move comes as a direct response to the industry-wide uncertainty that has unfolded since the Department of Commerce (DOC) March 28 announcement that it would act on a petition filed by California-based solar module manufacturer Auxin Solar requesting that DOC review solar panel imports from Chinese companies working in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, announcing that it was launching an antidumping investigation into those companies. 
Tariff risk for solar goods sourced from the four nations exceeded 50% to 250%, creating an untenable level of uncertainty that cascaded into canceled and delayed projects. The impact was so stark that it led the Solar Energy Industries Association to cut its project deployment forecast in half for the year. 
Paul Wormser, vice president of technology with Clean Energy Associates (CEA) told pv magazine USA that buyers and suppliers were essentially at a standoff, where neither the buyer nor the seller wanted to accept the risk. Neither party felt they could win in a negotiation, but both had something to lose if they didn’t negotiate. 
Wormser said the executive action will be impactful in removing a piece of that uncertainty in the near term. “Most people feel this was a positive move and very helpful to managing some of the challenges on the table right now,” he said. 
The move paves the way for supply contracts to get signed, prices to get better estimates, and factories and shipments from the four nations under investigation to get back on track. 
As for the latent impact from the investigation, Wormser said that projects did not go away entirely. “We did not see ‘demand destruction.’ The demand is still there, it is just unfulfilled. Instead of projects disappearing, a number of projects just changed their schedules. There will be a catch-up in deployment in what we had hoped to see in 2022, but that catch-up will take quite some time,” said Wormser. 
Other threats to supply 
“Unfortunately, there’s still going to be a dip in US deployments this year, versus what most of us would have predicted at the beginning of the year,” said Wormser. “There are ongoing issues with WRO (the Hoshine Withhold Release Order), there are new issues looming with UFLPA (Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act), and even though this particular issue of AD/CVD was ‘solved’ on Monday, it’s substantially towards the middle of the year before we had that solved.” 
Wormser said the UFLPA implementation is something to watch in the coming weeks. The act intensifies the burden of proof on importers, as they must prove that their goods must have no connection to the Xinjiang region of China, which has credible allegations of forced labor to the nation’s Uyghur community. 
He said that Xinjiang is the “center of gravity” for the world polysilicon supply chain, with a little less than half of the global polysilicon supply coming from the region. However, there is little to no wafer or cell manufacturing in the region, and there has never been a lack of absolute supply of polysilicon globally. China has made numerous announcements to move polysilicon production into other regions, so the UFLPA may not be as disastrous to solar module supply as it first appears. 
The WRO has led to the US detaining hundreds of MW of solar modules that were headed for US projects, but Wormser said that this pressure will continue to ease as module suppliers are now aware of what supply chain documentation is needed to clear Customs. 
The glut of undelivered products as a result of the triple-threat to US solar trade may take quite some time to reach US project sites. Wormser said the industry may be playing catch-up with this unserved demand into 2024. In the meantime, jobs have been lost, new jobs haven’t been created, and projects have been delayed. While it won’t be an overnight success, the softening of this trade triple-threat over time will lead to a steady supply flowing again, with US jobs and projects following. 
US manufacturing 
Concurrent with the two-year halt of solar tariffs on major Southeast Asian panels suppliers, the Biden Administration invoked the Defense Production Act and said it is using the full power of federal procurement capabilities to boost US-made solar. Master Supply Agreements will be put in place to enable domestic clean electricity providers to sell products to the US government rapidly, and US-made solar will be given “super preference” in federal procurement efforts. 
Christian Roselund, senior policy analyst, CEA, said the actions in total will likely not be enough to give a meaningful boost to US solar manufacturing. While every bit helps, running a solar module factory is much more costly in the United States than China, Southeast Asia, Turkey, or India, largely due to the wide gap in labor costs. Roselund said significant incentives to address the cost differential are likely the only path forward to make US solar competitive.
He added that CEA is still analyzing what the Defense Production Act means for US solar. He said that in the past, the act has been invoked to order US manufacturers to respond to crises, like making masks and respirators for Covid-19 response or munitions in wartime. 
“But I still haven’t seen anywhere in (the records), where the Defense Production Act has been used in a way that offsets higher operating costs. Because even if you provide grants and loans for the initial building of a factory, that doesn’t address the operating cost. It’s the medium to long term profitability that you have to worry about. What is needed is something to offset that price premium,” said Roselund. 
He said Jon Ossoff’s Solar Energy Manufacturing for America bill would do just that. However, it was tied up with the Build Back Better Act, which Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) shut down last December. Recently Democrats have voiced optimism that Manchin will cooperate on a climate bill, but Roselund said there is no guarantee anything meaningful will get by Manchin’s negotiations.

NREL claims the cell has better thermal stability and efficiency than other tandem devices based on perovskites. The researchers used a hole-transporting material made of phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) and guanidinium thiocyanate to improve cell stability.
“The addition of guanidinium thiocyanate bolstered the carrier lifetime from less than 200 nanoseconds to 1 microsecond,” they said, noting that the use of the compound also resulted in marked improvements in the structural and optoelectronic properties of the device.
They noted that the formation of a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) structure from additives based on mixed bulky organic cations phenethylammonium and guanidinium enables critical defect control. They claim that this significantly improves the structural and optoelectronic properties of lead-perovskite thin films with a narrow-bandgap of 1.25 eV.
“The combined additives also reduced the defect density associated with tin oxidation to a level unprecedented for tin-lead perovskites and similar to the values for lead-only perovskites,” they said.
The solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.5% and was able to retain 80% of its original efficiency after 1,500 hours of continuous operation, or more than 62 days.
“At this tandem efficiency level, the best reported stability in literature is normally several hundred hours,” the research group said. “The new cell also demonstrated an improvement in the voltage generated, at 2.1142 V. In comparison, the best certified tandem device registered 2.048 V.”
The scientists described the cell technology in “Carrier control in Sn–Pb perovskites via 2D cation engineering for all-perovskite tandem solar cells with improved efficiency and stability,” which was recently published in Nature Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/15/vehicle-integrated-solar-to-power-refrigerated-trailers/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,FRANCE,GERMANY",MARK HUTCHINS,"JUNE 15, 2022",Vehicle integrated solar to power refrigerated trailers,"Sono Motors will apply its vehicle-integrated PV solutions to the commercial transport sector, as part of a new partnership with Chereau, a France-based producer of refrigerated vehicles for transport of food, medicines and other deep frozen products.
The partnership will see the two companies collaborate to produce a prototype refrigerated truck integrated with 58.9m² of solar modules, amounting to 9.8 kW of generation capacity. The trailer is expected to be on the show at a transport trade show later this year, and will then undergo further testing to evaluate its suitability for a high-volume production vehicle.
“With this partnership, we are entering a new market for our solar technology,” Lars Löhle, product group lead at Sono Motors told pv magazine. “Our goal is to bring solar on every vehicle and we therefore offer a technology solution that is suitable for high volume series production. According to the innovative technology, energy savings of up to 80% compared to diesel can be achieved.”
In conventional refrigerated vehicles, cooling is powered either by a diesel generator separate from the truck engine, or an additional battery. By instead powering this through an integrated PV array, Sono Motors estimates that it can save 3,400 liters of fuel and avoid 9 tonnes of CO2 emissions per vehicle, per year. Sono has further calculated that production emissions for the solar integrated trailer amount to approximately 6.5 tons, which could be offset after less than one year.
After its unveiling in September, the truck will undergo a trial for several months in use by a Chereau customer in France. One of the goals of this trial is to verify Sono’s calculations regarding the energy yield and emissions reduction potential.
The system will be fitted with Sono Motors’ solar charge controller, which optimizes individual module energy yields to help the installation deal with shading. And the company has developed a manufacturing process specifically tailored to integration into the surface of the trailer, differing from the processes used in its Sion passenger vehicle, where more focus is required on integrating solar into the vehicle's curved surfaces.
“The solar integration solutions provided by Sono Motors are the perfect fit for our trailers. We are pleased to be able to work with Sono Motors to create the future prototype that will be part of our demo fleet of sustainable reefer trailers,” said Damien Destremau, CEO at The Reefer Group and Chereau. “This is a big step towards making commercial mobility more sustainable and reducing emissions.”
Finally, Sono Motors notes that it expects strongly growing demand for refrigerated transport in the coming years, with increasing demand for deep frozen good, fast food and medicines. Increasing fuel costs and growing restrictions/penalties being applied to CO2 emissions make the case for vehicles like this even more compelling.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/15/as-evs-drive-off-with-li-ion-supply-the-push-to-stationary-storage-alternatives-accelerates/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JUNE 15, 2022","As EVs drive off with Li-ion supply, the push to stationary storage alternatives accelerates","Mining and refinement capacity simply cannot keep up. Experts from mining industry prognosticators to Elon Musk foresee a widening chasm between li-ion supply and demand over the next few years. As that gap expands, expect the stationary renewable storage market to adopt emerging technologies more aligned with the needs of the stational market – and expect organizations to diversify well beyond Li-ion to meet energy demands and advance their renewable transformation goals.
Li-ion batteries are particularly suited to electric vehicle (EV) use cases: Li-ion’s energy density is required to make EVs viable. As EV adoption increases over the next decade, so too will Li-ion costs as lithium supply pressures grow in severity. In short, EVs will eat up Li-ion supply out of necessity, while alternatives already better-suited to stationary use cases carve out their own niche.
Such stationary alternatives aren’t just going to be more affordable, they’ll also be matched to their purpose. As a battery technology, Li-ion has been the standard, but it has limits. Li-ion batteries bring comparatively high operating expenses. They supply power for relatively short durations. They struggle in locations with extreme temperatures – which an ever-increasing swath of the world falls into. They’re also limited in their lifespans, and show environmental and safety issues over the long term.
These challenges leave the future open to alternatives more appropriate to stationary applications. While lead-acid and redox flow batteries struggle with many of the same issues as lithium-ion, other technologies aim to improve on where Li-ion falters.
In my view, there are three energy storage technology categories quickly maturing and with a clear potential to lead the stationary energy storage market into the future.
Metal-hydrogen batteries differentiate from lithium-ion by bringing similarly-low-cost materials to longer battery life spans (ergo, promising superior long-term cost efficiency). Those lifespans can top 30 years, and do so without Li-ion’s safety or environmental risks.
Metal-hydrogen is a proven technology that particularly excels in extreme conditions: the battery chemistry is newly adapted from orbital spacecraft such as the International Space Station and Hubble Space Telescope, where metal-hydrogen batteries have now completed more than 200 million cell-hours.
Metal-hydrogen batteries are able to perform 30,000 charge/discharge cycles without degradation, and operate in ambient temperatures ranging from -40° to 60 °C. Because they have no moving parts, they eliminate the need for regular maintenance.
Cost-per-kilowatt-hour cycles for these batteries can reach as little as a couple of pennies. The performance and longevity promise of these batteries will first put them into large-scale stationary renewable energy storage use cases involving harsh climates and remote locations, such as solar plants, wind farms, or micro-grids in deserts or other severe, hard-to-reach environments, but their flexibility portends widespread adoption in a multitude of use cases.
Gravity-assisted batteries leverage towers up to 500 feet that are tethered to systems of cranes, cables, and pulleys that support large bricks of composite materials. Software orchestrating this large and quite-stationary mechanism can elevate the bricks to store energy, and then lower the bricks to send energy out to the grid.
By design, each brick represents an individual store of energy, and multiple bricks can easily be manipulated simultaneously using the puppeteer-like arrangement of pulleys and cranes. In this way, gravity-assisted batteries offer high-speed energy delivery or absorption, with millisecond response times.
The system relies on affordable commodity equipment and offers differentiating benefits to a variety of use cases. These include quickly restoring power to a grid after an outage, providing backup energy, or balancing grid energy—especially that supplied from renewables which deliver energy intermittently.
One drawback to gravity-assisted batteries for some scenarios is that they require a lot of space to operate. While they might not be suited for urban applications, deserts represent a sweet spot for the technology.
Brownfield, Superfund, and old mining or extraction sites have been proposed as ideal locations for gravity-assisted batteries. As the mechanical designs have yet to be proven on a large scale, some uncertainty remains—particularly around the design and cost of O&M. Still, it’s an interesting concept.
The future of sodium-ion batteries is more of a direct replacement to lithium-ion. The technology offers competitive improvements across several areas. Sodium-ion uses sustainable and available materials with considerably less of an environmental impact. At the same time, they are also low cost and project to at least match the energy density of lithium-ion through ongoing iteration.
Existing facilities that manufacture li-ion batteries could be converted to produce sodium-ion batteries, making it a seamless drop-in technology upgrade for stationary energy storage.
Because of energy density and performance similarity to lithium-ion, sodium batteries will likely be allocated to e-mobility applications rather than stationary storage, but they represent a potential, viable alternative to lithium-ion nonetheless.
Li-ion has been a foundational technology, accelerating renewable energy storage to the position it has reached today. That said, Li-ion largely achieved its status as the de facto technology because it was the only one available. Now, a maturing range of technologies has arrived to address needs across an expanding breadth of use cases, and some will serve those applications better than others.
Expect the next decades to witness a more competitive landscape, where the market selects the most powerful and valuable storage technologies for each specific purpose. Use cases will evolve to provide more value with the flexible and simple approaches now available to the market.

Solar manufacturer Premier Energies and renewables developer Azure Power will jointly invest $89.6 million to set up a 1.25 GW solar cell and module facility in the Indian state of Telangana. The factory will produce 540 W mono PERC modules with M10 cells and 660 W modules with G12 cells.
Premier Energies will supply 2.4 GW of solar modules to Azure Power over the next four years. The company said it will build the factory according to global standards.
“Azure will have 26% of the total equity after deducting the debt,” Chiranjeev Saluja, the managing director of Premier Energies, told pv magazine. “Unlike GEF, which is a private equity investor in this facility, Azure is a strategic partner that is not only investing but also has an order book.”
The investment in the Premier Energies facility is part of Azure Power's commitment to work on capacity won under Solar Energy Corp. of India’s manufacturing-linked tender. The developer secured 4 GW of solar projects the auction, in return for committing to set up 1 GW worth of cell and module production lines.
“We have secured order book [from Azure] for four years. Further supply will be mutually extended as the SECI tender mandates Azure to have an equity stake of a minimum of 26% in the manufacturing project for eight years,” said Saluja.
Azure Power developed India’s first utility-scale solar project in 2009. Since then, it has become a leader in developing and operating large utility-scale renewable energy projects in the country.
Premier Energies is purportedly India’s second-largest integrated solar cell and module manufacturer. It has manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, with an operational capacity of 750 MW of solar cells and 1.25 GW of solar modules. It recently raised $25.8 million from GEF Capital Partners.

California-based Enovix said that it has demonstrated the ability of electric vehicle battery cells to charge from 0% to 80% capacity in as little as 5.2 minutes, and above 98% charge capacity in less than 10 minutes.
The cells also surpass 1,000 cycles, while retaining 93% of their capacity. These achievements have shattered the US Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) goal of achieving 80% charge in 15 minutes.
Other goals for USABC at the cell level include a usable energy density of 550 Wh/L, a survival temperature range of -40 C to 66 C, and a cost of $75/kWh at an annual output volume of 250,000 units. A full set of USABC targets can be found here.
The company demonstrated the fast-charge ability in its 0.27 Ah EV cells in its silicon lithium-ion batteries, which it said contain a novel 3D architecture and constraint system. The cells contain a 100% active silicon anode. Enovix said the material has long been heralded as an important technology in the next generation of battery anodes.
Silicon anodes can theoretically store more than twice as much lithium than the graphite anode that is used in nearly all Li-ion batteries today (1,800 mAh/cubic centimeter vs. 800 mAh/cubic centimeter).
“Fast charge capability can accelerate mass adoption of EVs and we’ve been able to demonstrate a level of performance that meets and exceeds many OEM roadmaps,” said Harrold Rust, co-founder, CEO and president of Enovix. “EV manufacturers are in pursuit of batteries that support longer range, while the public and private sectors work to increase EV driver access to fast chargers. We’re proud to support these goals to help electrify the automotive industry and demonstrate our batteries are an exciting option to power long-range, fast-charging EVs.”
“Our unique architecture enables a battery that not only charges in less than 10 minutes, but also maintains high cycle life,” said Ashok Lahiri, the CTO of Enovix. “We can improve battery performance today using the same chemistries, but more importantly, we can accelerate the industry’s roadmap.”
Lahiri spoke this week at the 12th International Advanced Automotive Battery Conference (AABC) Europe in Mainz, Germany. His presentation on silicon-anode lithium-ion batteries for EV applications will provide an update on the company’s EV program. The slide deck can be found here.

The scientists said they have added 15  new results to the new version of the tables since January. They also noted that an appendix describes new approaches and terminology.
Since 1993, when the tables were first published, the research group has seen major improvements in all cell categories.
“Copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS) and multijunction cells have seen the most consistent gains, although perovskites have recently seen similar overall gains compressed into a shorter timescale,” Green told pv magazine in an interview last year.
He said that the most important factor for inclusion in the tables is that all results should be independently measured at test centers on the group's list.
“All of our recognized test centers are carefully vetted prior to inclusion on our list and have been involved in round-robin testing with one another, ensuring consistency of measurements to well within the uncertainty estimates included with the published results,” said Green.

The Australian state of Queensland has announced a AUD 48 million investment, as part of its 2022-23 state budget, to advance two new large-scale pumped hydro energy storage projects.
Queensland Treasurer Cameron Dick said AUD 13 million had been allocated in the state budget set to be tabled on June 21 to accelerate key technical studies to enable a final investment decision on the proposed 1GW/24GWh Borumba pumped hydro project being developed near the southeastern city of Gympie.
Another AUD 35 million has been budgeted to advance a statewide search for a site for a second pumped hydro project to support the switch to renewables with storage seen as the key to unlocking Queensland’s renewable energy resources. Queensland is home to eight coal-fired power stations but the state government has committed to achieving zero net emissions by 2050, including a 50% renewable energy target by 2030.
Dick said growing Queensland’s energy storage capacity through pumped hydro, batteries and hydrogen is crucial to fully realising the state’s renewable energy opportunities and contributing to reliability and affordability.
“Renewable energy now accounts for more than 20% of Queensland’s energy generation, and we’re committed to powering that further,” he said. “Large-scale pumped hydro energy has the capacity to deliver a reliable supply of energy in an economic way.”
Energy Minister Mick De Brenni said the AUD 48 million investment set out a new path to storing renewable energy with pumped hydro to “play a critical role securing the future of Queensland’s energy system with a reliable supply of dispatchable power. As Queensland charges towards its renewable energy target, large-scale storage projects like pumped hydro will enable the continued investment in wind and solar.”
The government’s latest investment includes up to AUD 13 million to fast-track the development of the 1GW pumped hydro project being developed at the 46,000- megaliter Borumba Dam near Gympie.
The state government has already called for tenders for the project, which would feature 24 hours of storage, while work on a nearby 176 MW solar farm has also commenced.
“This funding will support detailed analytical studies that will consider the long-term benefits of this proposed large-scale storage project,” de Brenni said. “Powerlink is managing the design and cost analysis, while extensive community and stakeholder consultation will heavily inform all final decisions.”

Due to increases in efficiency and size, high-wattage solar panels are generating higher electrical currents, and thus an increased probability of heat events. Longi Solar has taken note of this as they develop solar modules, and it has released a brief analysis of its modules and junction boxes.
Junction boxes are placed on the back of solar panels, and are the interface that connects the panels to the outside world. Longi was the world’s largest seller of solar panels in 2021, so naturally they sold more junction boxes than any other manufacturer. They also predict that global solar installations will reach 1 TW each year by 2030.
The company notes that the “hot spot durability and diode thermal performance testing” logic is designed in accordance with the IEC 61215 & 62790 standards.
Longi compares its bifacial Hi-MO5 solar modules series, which has a lower front-side short-circuit current value of 13.9A, to a unit with a current of 18.5A. The company said lower voltages produce long-term product stability by lowering module temperatures, and associated temperature swings. It says that higher currents increase the chance of a fire.
Glass-glass bifacial solar panels do have an opportunity to reach 50 year useful lifetimes. Longi's analysis states that a competing 18.5A module can simply upgrade its junction box to 30A protection and meet a safety margin of 1.25 (accounting for bifacial gains). However, reducing current can limit the number of modules that can be wired on a string, due to lower voltage allowances.
Additionally, the temperature range of this high-current module would place it outside of Longi's suggested potential thermal runaway zone. Higher temperatures carry higher risks.
Longi explains that hot spots and thermal runaway can occur when modules are shaded while operating outdoors (as opposed to highly controlled lab conditions). This shading can be caused by fallen leaves, an accumulation of dust, or anything that blocks enough light to stop and reverse current, leading to thermal runaway. These hot spots can occur under fairly normal conditions, meaning these conditions must be accounted for as a design standard.
Since higher current panels tend to produce higher temperature hot spots and increased heat build up, Longi concludes that heat dissipation gear must be improved, particularly in equipment that doesn’t meet certain standards.
When these local current leaks occur regularly over decades of expected electricity generation, they silently, and permanently, reduce system output. While manufacturers could potentially mitigate the challenges of high currents with fuses and thicker copper wiring, Longi believes that starting with lower currents is the better solution, for now.

Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have voted by 76 votes to 62, with four abstentions, to oppose the commission's delegated act. The subject will now go to a full vote by parliament in a session that starts on July 4.
Opposition by an absolute majority of at least 353 MEPs would force the commission to withdraw or amend the legislation. The European Council, which includes representative politicians from each EU member state, also has until July 11 to veto the legislation.
Mairead McGuinness – the European commissioner for financial stability, financial services, and the capital markets union – defended the inclusion of gas and nuclear on the list of sustainable fuels when she addressed members of the environment and economic committees in March. She said the nuclear projects would only be eligible for consideration as “sustainable” if they adhered to strict measures relating to nuclear waste. She also said that gas projects must become clean or “low-carbon” by 2035 for inclusion on the list. Her appeal largely fell on deaf ears, however.
Committee members have said that any new or amended delegated acts tabled by the commission in the future will be subject to public consultation and impact assessments. The move to define gas and nuclear projects as sustainable, revealed by the commission during the Christmas and New Year break, was fiercely criticized in January by the executive's own advisory body, the Platform on Sustainable Finance.
