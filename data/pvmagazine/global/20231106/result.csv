Chinese battery and solar module manufacturer BYD has recently developed a bifacial photovoltaic panel for agrivoltaics, a company spokesperson has told pv mazagine.
The company developed the new “Bem-te-vi” panel at the BYD module factory located in Campinas, near Sao Paulo, Brazil. It has a power output of 340 W to 355 W and a 16.33% power conversion efficiency. It uses 36 half-cut, 23%-efficient monocrystalline PERC cells and features a multi-busbar architecture.
BYD energy spokesperson, Edson Pozzonbon, told pv magazine that the panel also features a transparent backsheet. “The panels can form greenhouses or enclosures, optimizing the use of space and allowing the passage of light to the crops,” he said.
BYD will deploy these new panels at a 100 kW agrivoltaic array at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) in Brazil.
Pozzonbon said commercially the panels will be offered as an “integrated energy solution” alongside inverters, battery storage systems and electric trucks. The sale of the combination package aims to fix the issue of Frankenstein solar systems, he said, which is a “problem” in Brazil. This is when a solar arrangement utilizes different companies' products and can lead to issues “establishing a connection between different equipment,” Pozzonbon said.
The BYD factory in Campinas reopened in 2022. It was upgraded with production equipment for modules based on multi-busbar, half-cell, and 1/3 cut cells. It has now an annual capacity of 500 MW and produces panels with power outputs ranging from 450 W to 670 W.
The factory opened in 2017 with an annual capacity of 200 MW, with the support of Apex-Brasil, the Brazilian government's trade and investment promotion agency. Solar projects that feature Brazilian-made components can obtain financing from the Brazilian Development Bank and Banco do Nordeste.

French manufacturer Armor Group previously owned Asca BmBG, the developer of organic PV (OPV) film.
According to the press release, Armor Group liquidated ASCA BmbG. Hering Group subsequently bought Asca and renamed it ASCA GmbH & Co. KG.
Asca produces organic PV from facilities in France and Germany. The business claims on its website to have a production capacity of 1 million square meters of film annually.
The acquisition by Hering Group – a centuries-old German construction and engineering company – consists of the Kitzingen production facilities, inventory, intellectual property, trademark rights and patents.
The Asca team will continue to “take care” of the technological developments in Kitzingen, the press release said. Hering Group said it intends to expand the Kitzingen site and “identify potential synergies in the product and construction sectors” which may include projects with railroad companies, municipalities and private customers.
According to an Armor Group press release from Jun. 2023, Acsa was a “largely loss-making” business. Following extensive research and development, roughly €100 million ($100.7 million) in investment, and successes, such as the 64 OPV modules installed on the roof at the Dubai World Expo in 2021, “sales did not take off.”
Armor Group said that the cost and return mix of Asca was “not favorable” and that at the end of June, it had concluded that the conditions “were not ripe” to continue developing OPV-based solar solutions. CSA’s French and German operations would be “restructured,” the press release said.

An Econergy spokesperson told pv mgazine today that the plant will be connected to the grid “in the next few weeks.”
Econergy’s vice president of operations Andrea Loi told pv magazine that the utility-scale project is expected to generate 219.19 TWh per annum and cost a total €102 million ($109 million) to construct. He said the plant is spread across 170 hectares in Rătești, southern Romania, and uses Canadian Solar monocrystalline bifacial and monofacial panels, mixing 655 W and 660 W output classes.
Loi said the park is currently being tested to identify and repair any potential issues, and a company team is developing a “robust” power purchase agreement (PPA) strategy. Once the commercial operation date lapses, Loi said Econergy will “retain the control” of the plant's operation and maintenance activities, as well as facility asset management.
Asked why Romania is an ideal place to do solar-related business, Loi said the nation is a “fast developing and evolving country” for clean energy. “As the nation transitions to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, it holds tremendous potential to become a regional leader in Eastern Europe,” he said.
pv magazine reached out to NoFar Energy for comment but did not get a response.
Romanian Photovoltaics Industry Assocation’s executive director Andrei Manea told pv magazine this utility-scale project “kicks off” a new period of investment for the Eastern European country. “By the end of the year we'll have around 800 MW of new solar parks,” he said.
Manea said this PV plant was Romania’s largest and is located in the country’s south – “one of the best parts [of the country] for PV irradiance,” he said.
Romania had 1,414 MW of solar installed at the end of 2022, according to the latest data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

According to tender documents, the government-owned Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is welcoming bids to develop two 100 MW floating solar plants on the surface of Samanalawewa Reservoir, located 160 km south of the country’s capital of Colombo.
The Samanalawewa Power Station is one of five power plant assets owned by CEB. In 2021, the hydroelectric facility recorded 120 MW installed capacity and generated 405.19 GWh, according to a CEB annual report.
The aim of these twin PV facilities is to “leverage” the reservoir's existing hydroelectric energy generation capabilities by “complementing” it through daytime solar energy production, the tender documents said. Successful bidders will be awarded 20-year power purchase agreements and are expected to connect “early” to the electricity grid.
“Experienced and qualified firms” must only submit one proposal for 100 MW capacity. Proposals must include details about the power plant as well as grid interconnection, such as transmission lines and substations. The deadline for applications is Dec. 13 2023.
Last month the Sri Lankan government announced it was inviting applicants to submit their proposals for the development of three ground-mounted or floating PV projects ranging from 1 MW to 5 MW.
Sri Lanka recorded 714 MW installed solar PV capacity at the end of 2022, according to the most recent data published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

While game theory is concerned with analyzing strategic interactions among rational decision-makers, real options theory deals with evaluating investment decisions in uncertain or dynamic environments.
“There are two reasons why combining game theory with real options theory for modeling,” the researchers said. “Firstly, the auction decision is an investment decision. The real options theory is an important theory for investment decisions. Secondly, investors need to consider the behavior of potential competitors in their auction decision-making. Thus, adopting game theory to guide auction decision-making is also necessary.”
In preemption games, players decide a time to stop and trade off the strategic costs derived from outlasting other players and the gains offered by the passage of time.
“Under the preemption competition, the investor loses all gains if competitors seize the opportunity,” the scientists said. “To avoid losing out to competitors and gain as much investment income as possible, the investor chooses to invest at a smaller investment income than they would have if there are no competitors.”
The academics examined two types of subsidy auctions – one based on production quantity and required subsidy rates, and another with a fixed subsidy amount, with participants competing to provide the best terms. They found that higher subsidy levels in the auctions result in lower final prices.
The two auction forms were modeled under three scenarios. In the first, the bidder has no competitors; in the second, they do have competitors, but they lack information about their investment income; and in the third, they lack information about the competitors' investment costs. The modeling was based on cost, interest rate, and the variability of investment costs, among other parameters.
“It can be found that when there are no competitors, as the investment cost increases, the investor will necessarily choose to invest when they can obtain greater investment income,” the academics said about the first case. “As the safe interest rate increases, the investor likewise chooses to invest at greater investment income. Furthermore, with the same investment cost, as the safe interest rate increases, the investor tends to invest when they can obtain greater investment income.”
For the second and third scenarios, the researchers said that the overall trend of triggering investment is similar to the no-competition scenario.
“This indicates that when the investor does not have access to information on competitors' investment income or investment cost, it can refer to the bidding strategy of the absence of competitors to guide decisions,” they explained.
The researchers also concluded that in the fixed-subsidy auction, the annual power production after the project investment has the most effect on bidding strategies. That is due to the additional steps that have to be done in this strategy to find the investment trigger point.
“The investor can refer to the investment trigger point under the volume-based subsidy form for initial decision-making. Then, by estimating the annual power production after the investment and combining it with the subsidy level under the fixed amount subsidy form, the approximate subsidy level per unit of power generation can be obtained,” the researcher said. “Then, according to the relationship between the subsidy level per unit of power generation under two subsidy forms, a specific bidding decision can be made.”
In both auction formats, the researchers said that higher government subsidies led to lower investor bidding prices and increased investor participation. They presented their findings in “The bidding strategy for renewable energy auctions under government subsidies,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy. The group includes academics from the Shandong University of Finance and Economics and Tongji University in China, as well as from the Technical University of Denmark.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/11/06/solyco-switches-on-vertical-pv-systems-on-green-rooftops-in-germany/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",VALERIE THOMPSON,"NOVEMBER 6, 2023",Solyco switches on vertical PV systems on green rooftops in Germany,"Solyco has deployed its first vertical rooftop PV system at two different locations in Germany.
The Germany-based company described its Solon system as an ideal solution for the residential and commercial flat rooftop market, especially for so-called green roofs, which are rooftops covered with low-maintenance gardens and plants.
One of the two systems is located in Hamburg. The 10 kW project features 68 vertically mounted modules. The second array, in Hannover, includes 79 panels, with a total installed capacity of 12.64 kW.
Both installations have glass-glass bifacial modules made with tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells, installed in a vertical fashion to minimize shadows on the vegetation below. A ballast-supported racking system provides support and avoids drilling into the roof.
The vertical orientation delivers peak power early and late in the day with a valley formed at noon with an east-west orientation, according to the company.
The Solon system relies on frameless custom-designed modules that are smaller than the standard size, measuring 2,011 mm x 415 mm, with a rated power of 160 W. The weight is around 23 kg/m². The panels have 3.2 mm glass sheets front and back with forty-two M10-sized TOPCon cells. The system’s installed nominal capacity is 100W/m², according to the company.
The substructures of the horizontal and vertical aluminum profiles are connected by cross-bracing. Stable connections are secured with a profile connector and bolted with M6 cap screws and safety nuts. The black coating finish on the metal racking and hardware provides the aesthetics reportedly required for this type of application.
Philip Kallenberg, product manager for Solyco, told pv magazine that the main reason it chose TOPCon cells over passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) cells is because they can reach about “85% bifacial coefficients,” which results in “more balanced energy production” throughout the day.
“A vertical PV system in combination with a green roof is the ideal roofing strategy for any flat roof. It combines the ecological advantages of green roofs with the local production of renewable energy,” Solyco CTO Lars Podlowski told pv magazine.
The company's wind tunnel test have confirmed that the system does not experience drag or lift forces. According to Kallenberg, wind loads primarily impact the first and last rows of modules, resulting in fewer required ballast blocks compared to traditional horizontal installations.
“Only the first and last row need ballast bases to prevent displacement,” Kallenberg stated.
Recently installed pilot systems in Hannover and Hamburg follow tests of an earlier version of the system at an outdoor location near the company’s headquarters in Berlin. Solyco developed the technology in cooperation with ISC Konstanz, University of Applied Sciences HTW Berlin, and funded by the country’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) through its program for SMEs (ZIM).
Solyco sells the systems through distributors and partners, such as Germany-based Optigrün International. Certifications include IEC 61215: 2016, IEC 61730: 2016, and a 25-year product warranty and linear performance guarantee.

Documents provided by the West Australian Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) confirm that Fortescue has terminated the approval applications process for the multi-billion-dollar Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub planned for the state’s Pilbara region.
Fortescue had planned to build a renewable energy hub comprising a 3.33 GW solar farm and 2.04 GW wind farm backed by 9.1 GWh of battery energy storage on an 10,000-hectare site approximately 120 kilometres south of the coastal town of Onslow.
Fortescue lodged environmental documents with the EPA early last year but the authority has now confirmed that the company terminated the approvals process midway through last month.
The project had been identified as a critical component of the company’s plan to decarbonize its mining operations in Western Australia by 2030.
Fortescue, which estimates its mining operations generate more than 2.5 million tons of carbon equivalent each year, has forecast it will need to deploy an additional 2 GW to 3 GW of renewable energy generation and battery storage to decarbonize its operations by the end of the decade.
The November issue of pv magazine, due out Thursday, is dominated by the issue of global oversupply and examines the effects of a solar glut in the European Union, the United States, and other markets. We turn the spotlight on PV developments in South Korea, Taiwan, and Africa and update readers on technological progress in thin films, kerfless wafering, and mass produced heterojunction PV.
In a presentation to analysts and investors in October, Fortescue outlined plans to build more than 1 GW of solar, about 1 GW of wind energy, and about 4 GWh of battery storage to eliminate gas and diesel from its mining operations.
The company said one 60 MW solar farm has already been built at Chichester by Alinta, and construction of a 100 MW solar farm at North Star Junction, near its Iron Bridge magnetite operations, is nearing completion and two small battery projects are well advanced.

The system combines a multi-junction organic solar cell with a dual-ion organic battery. “Miniature devices like these being developed under the concept of the Internet of Things require energy sources that are as compact as possible in order to function autonomously,” the scientists explained, adding that IoT environments have strict inherent limitations for size.
The battery has a cathode-active material based on phenothiazine conjugated redox polymer and an anode material based on lithium metal. Its cell voltage is 3.7 V, a value that requires the solar cell used in the system to have sufficient voltage to be able photocharge the battery without any additional external voltage or current.
The 1 cm2 organic solar cell consists of a 5-junction device with an inverted architecture. Each of the five cell units includes a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), an electron transport layer (ETL) made of zinc oxide (ZnO), an organic absorber made of two polymers known as PM6 and PC60BM, a hole transport layer (HTL) relying on PEDOT:PSS, and a silver metal contact.
“The repeating unit was coated several times, with the same parameters as for the single-junction cells,” the researchers said, adding that they used aluminum (Al) tape to connect the two solar cell electrodes to the battery holder electrodes and an insulator film to avoid shunting.
Tested under 1 Sun illumination conditions, the solar cell achieved an open-circuit voltage of 4.2 V, which the group said is one of the highest values ever reached for solution-processed solar cells.
Taking advantage of this high voltage level and careful control of illumination intensity and discharge rates, the photovoltaic dual-ion battery could be charged in less than 15 minutes at discharge capacities of up to 22 mAh/g. The system can also achieve an average discharge potential of 3.6 V, an energy density of 69 mWh/g and a power density of 95 mW/g.
“The photo-battery reported herein, while significantly optimizable, represents a large step forward in the development of compact energy sources for integrated, low power applications and will pave the way for future developments of such devices using organic active materials,” the researchers said.
The scientist presented the battery technology in the paper “Organic photo-battery with high operating voltage using a multi-junction organic solar cell and an organic redox-polymer-based battery,” published in Energy & Environmental Science.
