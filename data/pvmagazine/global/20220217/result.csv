With a clear strategy outlined to reduce its dependence on Asian battery cell imports, Europe is set to host around 35 gigafactories by 2035, according to the latest predictions.
The newest project announcement has come from Anglo-Korean battery maker Eurocell, which yesterday said it will build its first European gigafab. The extraordinary aspect of Eurocell’s plan is that it promises to start manufacturing at scale within just 12 months, thanks to the company's “proven, production-ready technologies.”
With an initial £600 million (€716 million) investment planned in two phases, Eurocell intends to supply European energy storage, automotive, e-mobility and customer electronics industries. The first phase will begin producing battery cells at scale by early next year for existing customers, Eurocell announced. In parallel, a bespoke facility will be constructed on the same site capable of producing more than 40 million cells per year by 2025.
Eurocell says it is looking at potential sites for its European manufacturing base and will make a final choice depending on government support and investment. “We are actively seeking a European manufacturing base and are in advanced discussions with sites in the UK, Netherlands and Spain,” said the company's CEO for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Recardo Bruins. “With the right level of central engagement and support we are keen to take advantage of the rapidly growing European market as quickly as possible.”
In return, the manufacturer said in a press release to announce the fab, the host country will benefit from “the creation of hundreds of direct and indirect jobs, transferring vital skills from Korean battery experts and boosting the economy in a strategic sector crucial to achieving Europe’s net zero ambitions.”
Eurocell has two product lines that it says can deliver better performance than conventional lithium-ion batteries. Its ultra-fast charging “UFC” battery is able to capture any input charge under any condition at a 10C rate, has a long cycle life of more than 5,000 cycles, and is 100% safe in the event of impact, penetration or shocks, so no there is no risk of thermal runaway and self-ignition, the company claims. The UFC batteries have a lithium-titanate-oxide anode which, according to Eurocell, allows for that long cycle life and a 25-year-plus lifespan, and a lithium-nickel-manganese-oxide cathode. The product's weak point is low energy density, which is why lithium-titanate batteries are usually deployed only in bulky vehicles, where space is less of an issue than it is in passenger cars.
The manufacturer's ultra-high capacity “UHC” battery excels at capacity, according to its developer, and is said to outperform conventional lithium-ion batteries by 150% by virtue of its silicone-graphite composite anode. That feature comes at a cost, however, and the UHC battery costs more than 30% more than conventional alternatives. Eurocell says its batteries have a wide operating temperature range, from -20 to 50 degrees Celsius, making them well-suited for use in extreme weather and without a grid network.
Eurocell is by no means alone in its ambition to secure a slice of the European battery market. According to data from the EU's important projects of common European interest (IPCEI) fund, which aims to promote critical projects including battery production in Europe, a massive build-up and expansion of energy storage production capacity is being planned.
Urban transportation is key to modern civilization. But it has come at a cost, contributing to a dangerous carbon footprint, high levels of smog, a growing inequality gap, and the destruction of some of our most fragile environments. Thus, in the first quarter of this year, pv magazine’s UP Initiative will focus on the rise of e-mobility and how it can complement the renewable energy transition. Read our coverage here.
The annual production volume of lithium-ion cells in the EU's member states – plus Norway and EU accession state Serbia – amounted to around 35GWh in 2020, around 15% of the global total. That figure is expected to rise to 600-870GWh – 43% of the estimated world market – by the end of the decade.
The companies leading the charge in Europe are Tesla, Northvolt, and LG Chem, according to Scottish consultancy Delta-EE, which has estimated they will supply 27% of the bloc's li-ion production capacity in Europe by 2030. In terms of where the factories will be built, Germany is the top location so far, with France and Italy expected to become the second and third biggest markets by 2030 in terms of annual manufacturing capacity, overtaking Hungary, which is currently Europe's second largest battery manufacturing state.
While it is hoped enormous demand for li-ion cells in the automotive industry in the years ahead will be met through the planned expansion and development of production capacities, the supply of batteries will also hinge on sufficient availability of semiconductors and raw materials. The first noticeable deficits emerged for nickel last year and shortfalls of up to 50% in cobalt, copper, lithium and graphite are forecast for next year and 2024. As a result, US analyst BloombergNEF's recently published 2021 Battery Price Survey forecast an increase in li-ion cell prices this year after decades of declining prices.
“To counteract the threat of raw material shortages, recycling capacities are being successively built up, the utilization of alternative raw material deposits is being evaluated, and research is being conducted on novel cell chemistries that use fewer or no critical raw materials,” the European Union's IPCEI fund said in its quarterly market analysis.

France deployed 2,687MW of new solar capacity in 2020, thus achieving its best performance ever recorded in terms of new installations.
For comparison, the country installed 973MW in 2020, 883MW in 2018, and 890MW in 2017.
According to new figures released by French renewable energy association SER, the fourth quarter was particularly dynamic, with around 761MW of new PV systems connected to the grid.
As of the end of December 2021, France had reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 13,067MW.
The SER also reported that the electricity produced by PV arrays in France reached nearly 14.3TWh in 2021, an increase of 12.6% compared to the previous year. The Nouvelle-Aquitaine region was the most productive, with 3.8TWh, ahead of Occitanie and the Provence Alpes-Côte d'Azur region (with, respectively, 3TWh and 2.1TWh).
Solar reached, for the first time, in 2021, a 3% share in total electricity consumption, which compares to 2.8% in 2020. From June to August 2021, record levels of more than 5% were recorded.

German football club SC Freiburg has announced that a 2.4MW rooftop solar array is currently under construction on the roof of its Europa-Park stadium.
Swiss solar manufacturer Meyer Burger Technology has provided its heterojunction panels for the project, which is the world's second largest PV system built on a stadium roof to date.
The project was selected in a tender for commercial PV projects recently held by the German federal network agency and will be developed by Badenova Wärmeplus, SC Freiburg's energy and environmental partner.
Around 6,000 high-performance solar modules from Meyer Burger will be installed on a 15,000m2 roof area. Badenova Wärmeplus is investing around €2.3 million in the system, which it will operate over a 20-year period.
“In order to meet the high sustainability standards of the city of Freiburg and the sports club, as well as our own standards, we consciously rely on high-performance modules that are manufactured in Germany,” said Badenova board member Heinz-Werner Hölscher.
“This clearly puts us in the photovoltaic Champions League,” says Moritz Borgmann, chief commercial officer at Meyer Burger. “Solar energy offers a lot of potential to reduce emissions using already built-up areas, to become climate-neutral and to give climate protection more drive with a forward-looking technology – not only for soccer clubs.”
*The article was amended on February  21 to reflect that the PV system planned for the SC Freiburg's stadium is the world's second largest, and not the largest one built on a stadium to date, as we previously reported.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/17/bangladesh-needs-more-labs-to-check-quality-of-solar-imports/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,QUALITY,BANGLADESH",SYFUL ISLAM,"FEBRUARY 17, 2022",Bangladesh needs more labs to check quality of solar imports,"A private sector thinktank in Bangladesh has called on the government to provide the solar equipment testing facilities needed to back up planned legislation mandating quality assurance for imported goods.
With consumers having long voiced concern about imports of sub-standard rooftop solar equipment, government agency the Bangladesh Standard and Testing Institution (BSTI) has prepared minimum performance rules for solar modules, inverters, batteries, and charge controllers. Those regulations are in the process of being incorporated into the import policy order for 2021-24. Inclusion in the policy order will require mandatory testing of the products.
However, there are concerns the small number of BSTI-owned solar equipment testing labs available in the country will not be sufficient to ensure minimum standards are upheld.
Tahmid Zami, additional research director for the Business Initiative Leading Development thinktank, said: “It is now essential to develop [the required] testing and certification capacity.”
The BSTI has three labs suitable for testing solar equipment performance, at the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR); Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET); and Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology. Further facilities, at the Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology and at Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, are preparing to undertake the same services.
BSTI director general Nazrul Anwar said the institution will set up 69 new laboratories by 2041, including 21 capable of analyzing the physical standards of goods for certification. “The BSTI is working with other government institutions, as well as private sector organizations, to upgrade the country’s testing, certification and quality compliance regime in the area of rooftop solar power,” he said.
A year ago, pv magazine reported government body the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority had approved the use of 17 laboratories owned by state entity the Bangladesh Petroleum Corp for testing solar equipment. In addition to the BCSIR and BUET labs, pv magazine reported a senior BSTI official had suggested unspecified “private sector facilities” could also be used for testing.
At present, none of the BSTI-owned laboratories has international accreditation, which could pose problems for Bangladeshi solar manufacturers seeking to export their products.
Mohin Habib, chief executive of Bangladeshi solar manufacturer Rahimafrooz Renewable Energy Ltd, said lowering the lead time for testing solar equipment is a must for the sector’s sustainability.
This article was amended on 17/02/22 to indicate the import policy order which would require testing of solar modules, inverters, batteries and charge controllers is for the 2021-24 period, not the 2021-22 fiscal year, as previously stated.

Researchers from the Zhejiang University in China used commercially available solar cells to create an underwater optimized lens-free system for high-speed optical detection and have found that the PV devices enable a much larger detection area than commonly used photodiodes. “Solar panels are being increasingly used as detectors in underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) systems, as the large detection area can significantly simplify the link alignment,” the scientists explained. “However, the greatest problem in such a scheme is the limited bandwidth of the solar panel, which was originally optimized for energy harvesting rather than communication.”
In the proposed system, the solar cells are connected in series and are able to convert sunlight to an electrical signal. They act as detectors that can ease the transmitter-receiver alignment requirement in an underwater wireless communication system. “Until now, achieving high-speed links using off-the-shelf silicon solar cells has required complex modulation schemes and algorithms, which need intense computing resources that use extra power and create a high processing latency,” said researcher Jing Xu. “Using modeling and simulation of connected solar cells, we optimized the peripheral circuit, which significantly improved the performance of our solar cell-based detector.”
A solar array was tested in a 7-meter-long water tank emulating a 35-m underwater channel and was found to achieve a data rate of 150 megabits per second (Mbps) with a frequency domain equalizer. Mirrors were applied to extend the pathlength of the optical signal. “The system showed reliable stability, low power consumption and high performance,” the researchers stated. “As the size of the solar array increases from 1×1 to 3×3, the −20-dB bandwidth increases from 4.4 MHz to 24.2 MHz.”
The system was presented in the paper Series-connected solar array for high-speed underwater wireless optical links, published in Optica. “Because solar cells are mass produced, the proposed scheme is quite cost-effective,” concluded Xu. “Beyond the underwater world, this type of detector could also be used in visible light communication, a type of wireless communication that uses visible light from LEDs and other sources to transmit data across distances.”
The performance of underwater solar cells was investigated in 2020 by scientists from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science and the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and Defence Materials. According to their findings, submerged cells benefit from lower temperatures and are in an ideal environment for cleaning. “Although there are challenges and limitations, the results obtained show that there is an enormous potential for solar PV technology in underwater monitoring sensors or devices, and various other commercial and defense applications with modern-day power electronics,” the researchers stated at the time.

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar have designed and developed a solar system for water pumping which can easily be moved from one farm to another. The kit is useful for pumping water in remote areas and helps small scale farmers who could pool money to use the equipment on a shared basis.
The technology has already been deployed in hard-to-reach areas of the state of Odisha.
IIT Bhubaneswar academics Srinivas Bhaskar Karanki, of the school of electrical sciences, and Satish D Dhandole, from the school of mechanical sciences, led the project.

Karanki told pv magazine: “We have used a tractor trolley for the movable system. The trolley is designed to have a foldable structure to accommodate six panels. The trolley needs to be attached with the tractor head to move from one place to another. The system works with two different types of pumps, one submersible and the other surface-mounted. The surface-mount is taken along with the movable SPV [solar photovoltaic] system. Further, the movable structure is equipped with an inverter.”  
The system can generate enough power to operate submersible and monoblock-pump AC motors even at low irradiation. The inverter circuitry is designed to achieve maximum solar energy harvesting with single-stage power conversion from DC to AC, thereby increasing reliability and reducing the overall cost.
The system can also be operated from a single-phase grid electricity supply, if needed, and is designed to operate a 2hp AC pump with the inverter able to accommodate up to 5hp loads.
The mobile solar pumps have been installed in 13 locations in districts including Angul, Dhenkanal, Puri, Bhadrak, Korput, Keonjhar, Nayagarh, and Mayurbhaj. Three more systems have been installed in the villages of Podapada, Kanaspada, and Khudupur, with those settlements having been adopted by IIT Bhubaneswar under the government's Unnat Bharat Abhiyan policy, which aims to leverage scientific advances developed in academic institutions in rural settings.
The mobile solar project is funded by the Directorate of Agriculture and Food Production of the government of Odisha under the central government's Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana agricultural development program.

The deal will see Magnora assume control of AGV's more-than-800MW of wind and solar generation capacity after the target company recently signed several land lease option agreements. AGV has already been responsible for some of Magnora’s development activity in South Africa.

Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.

With the South African government targeting the addition of 6GW of solar this decade – plus 14GW of onshore wind farms – under its latest Integrated Resource Plan national energy strategy, AGV has previously stated an ambition to develop more than 2GW of solar and wind in its domestic market.
Magnora explained the acquisition by stating South Africa is an attractive region for solar and wind development as more than 35GW of its coal-fired power fleet will be decommissioned by 2050. The nation currently generates more than 80% of its energy from coal-fired facilities.
Erik Sneve, chief executive of Magnora, said: “We see great opportunities in South Africa both in the short and long term and we expect increased power consumption due to economic development and green electrification. AGV’s approach to attractive [power-]sourcing projects is complementary to our methods and capabilities and we look forward to having them as a part of the Magnora team.”
Torstein Sanness, chairman of the Norwegian business, said: “Magnora is increasing and sharpening its focus on South Africa in light of the current positive developments in the country and we are confident that the AGV organization will prove to be key to develop[ing] Magnora South Africa in the coming years.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/17/irish-senator-proposes-solar-mandate-on-public-buildings/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,IRELAND",MAX HALL,"FEBRUARY 17, 2022",Irish senator proposes solar mandate on public buildings,"A member of Ireland's upper house of parliament has called for solar to be compulsory on all new public buildings during a debate over a Green Party bill moving to exempt panels on farms and public sites from planning permission.
During a committee-stage debate in the Seanad Éireann, the Irish Senate, Fianna Fáil senator Fiona O'Loughlin said the government should also pay for the installation of solar panels on school roofs.
The proposal to exempt panels on schools and other public buildings from the need to have planning consent was tabled by the Green Party in June and the party yesterday welcomed comments reportedly made by the Taoiseach, Micheál Martin, on Tuesday, which indicated the bill could be expected to make progress into legislation within three weeks.
In this month’s edition, pv magazine takes a deep dive into the world of electromobility, with 22 pages of analysis taking in the market growth and expectations for electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide; how electricity networks will need to grow and adapt to make room for the electrification of transport; and the vital role for solar in all of this. We examine the growing trend for residential and commercial EV chargers linked to PV and optimized to make the most of solar kilowatt-hours, and take a look at some of the early movers working on vehicle-integrated PV – from solar sunroofs to full integration in vehicle bodywork. We also consider a range of e-mobility applications, from commercial trucks to family cars to electric bikes and other “last mile” delivery vehicles.
The legislation introduced by the Green Party – which is a member of Ireland's coalition government alongside center-right parties Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael – would also remove a restriction which currently means only half the roofspace on schools, public buildings and commercial properties can be fitted with solar panels outside of the planning regime.
Similarly, the bill proposes permitting ground-mounted PV arrays of up to 100m2 rather than the current 25m2, and would permit such arrays to be up to 4m off the ground, doubling the current restriction for systems outside the planning regs.
Supporters of the bill claim it is of vital importance to back the microgeneration rules recently introduced by environment minister and Green Party member Eamon Ryan, which introduced payments for renewable energy generators who export their excess electricity into the grid.
With Green Party senator Róisín Garvey yesterday indicating electricity payment income would be of crucial importance to farmers facing rising input costs, O'Loughlin, a former chair of the committee on education and social protection, said the same was true of schools, for whom rapidly rising electricity costs are frequently among their largest expenses.
Independent senator Sharon Keogan backed the proposed legislation but warned it must be accompanied by rules ensuring the best possible practices be put in place to ensure the recycling of end-of-life solar panels.
With the debate beginning yesterday, a transcription of the discussion published on the website of Irish government the Oireachtas yesterday closed with the phrase: “Additional debate to follow.”
During the committee debate, Garvey had stressed the importance of prioritizing the legislation by saying: “For the farms of Ireland, for the schools of Ireland, for the community halls all over the country, the 4,000 schools and 2 million homes, this needs to happen as soon as possible.”

“The device could be used in indoor photovoltaics, smart power generation windows, and mobile wearable devices in the future,” researcher Jingxia Wang told pv magazine.
The scientists used a special meniscus–assisted coating (MAC) technique. The method is commonly used in the deposition of semiconducting polymers of different kinds and relies on the use of a dynamic meniscus during the blade-coating process.
“By directionally moving the meniscus, it transforms from a symmetrical shape into an asymmetric geometry under the dual action of the shear force and the adhesion force of the substrate,” the researchers explained. “Finally, a high–quality blend film is deposited on the substrate accompanied by the uniform evaporation of the solute.”
They said it's important to control the liquid advancing speed and maintain the dynamic balance of the transition state between the solution and solid film. They claim this allows the formation of a binary nanofiber network morphology with crystallization enhancement.

This printing strategy, they went on to say, is used to achieve the highly aligned conjugated polymer thin-films for high-mobility organic field-effect transistor and, ultimately, to optimize the morphology of the cell's active layer to achieve higher efficiencies.
They fabricated the device on a substrate made of PEDOT:PSS, coated on indium tin oxide (ITO) glasses, with a polymer donor known as PM6 and a polymer acceptor called PY–IT. They chose these on the basis of their well-matched energy levels and absorption spectra.
Through the meniscus-assisted process, the Chinese group was able to produce a champion solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 15.53%, an open circuit voltage of 0.945V, a short-circuit current of 23.27mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 70.77%. For comparison, a reference solar cell fabricated via common spin coating reached a lower efficiency of 14.58%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.936V, a short-circuit current of 22.54 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 69.10%.
“To the best of our knowledge, the power conversion efficiency of 15.53% from MAC is the highest among the solution-printing-based all-polymer solar cells,” the scientists stated, noting that they were also able to build a larger device with an active area of 1cm2, with an efficiency of 12.55%.
They described the solar cell in “The Meniscus-assisted-coating with Optimized Active Layer Morphology towards Highly Efficient All-polymer Solar Cells,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials.
“This work not only provides a simple and efficient solution printing method for the preparation of all-polymer solar cells, but also gives constructive theoretical guidance at different shear rates,” Wang concluded.

(Kepco), has signed a memorandum of understanding with Hanmaeum Energy, a Singapore-based private equity firm owned by Affirma Capital and Duham Partners to deploy 100MW of solar capacity on idle areas close to highways in South Korea.
The project will be part of a South Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) program that facilitates the development of energy-independent roads. It will be developed in three phases, starting with two 20MW phases. The entire project will be able to generate 130,000MWh per year upon completion.
“KHNP will continue to actively promote renewable energy power generation facilities where environmental damage is minimal and social costs are not incurred,” said KHNP President Jeong Jae-hoon.

The MOLIT currently operates around 319 solar arrays totaling 149 MW at several idle sites managed by Korea Expressway Corp. (KEC), which runs the toll roads of South Korea. It has decided to give privates companies the opportunity to lease other idle sites to deploy their projects.
The surface will have to be leased for a 20-year period and developers will have to pay an unspecified usage fee. The KEC will offer surfaces on the slopes of the embankment of highways, the green areas around junctions, the rooftops of buildings, and parking lots.
The South Korean government aims to deploy around 30MW of solar in 2021 and 243MW by 2025. It also wants to build 50MW of hydrogen fuel cell facilities. In late March, the MOLIT announced a separate plan to build solar using railway infrastructure.

Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), the wholly owned subsidiary of Australian-based iron ore giant Fortescue Metals Group, and natural gas supplier Woodside Energy have made a shortlist of four companies to partner with New Zealand electricity generators Meridian Energy and Contact Energy on their 600MW Southern Green Hydrogen project.
Meridian Energy and Contact Energy are looking to establish a large-scale green hydrogen production and export facility in the country's Southland region using renewable energy supplied by the existing 800MW Manapouri hydroelectric power station.
Manapouri, the largest hydroelectric generator in New Zealand, currently supplies the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter, which consumes about 12% of New Zealand’s electricity. That supply agreement is set to expire in December 2024.
The exit of the smelter, majority-owned by Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto, will free up an estimated 438GWh of renewable energy per year. Meridian and Contact are looking to repurpose that renewable electricity into the emerging green hydrogen industry.
This week, they announced a shortlist of four potential development partners for the project, including FFI and Woodside. Other companies included on the shortlist were UK-based engineering and gas supply company BOC, and a consortium featuring Japan's Mitsui and Eneos.
The Meridian and Contact joint venture said the shortlist was selected after a registration of interest process attracted more than 80 responses. Meridian Chief Executive Neal Barclay said the shortlist is a major step forward in the commercialisation of Southland’s green hydrogen opportunity.
“These shortlisted counterparties all have strong hydrogen supply chain capability and a willingness to invest in the opportunity,” he said. “Their involvement demonstrates that markets for green hydrogen are imminent, and that Aotearoa’s renewable energy resources have substantial potential to help decarbonise our domestic economy and increase export earnings.”
The joint venture said the shortlisted parties would now put together early stage business plans and cases for the large-scale green hydrogen production facility. Their plans are due to be submitted by mid-April. The chosen partner or partners is expected to be announced by the middle of 2022 with development activities to commence in the second half of the year.
Contact CEO Mike Fuge said Southern Green Hydrogen was one of the most advanced large-scale projects in the world in terms of its progress to market.
“It’s good to see things moving forward with the RFP and bring the project closer to fruition,” he said. “There has been a massive amount of interest from leading engineering firms involved with green hydrogen.”
The announcement is the latest green hydrogen project for FFI.
FFI founder and Fortescue Chairman Andrew Forrest has previously announced ambitious plans to build one of the biggest renewable energy portfolios in the world, delivering more than 235GW of renewable capacity. FFI also recently announced plans with AGL to flip New South Wales’s coal generators in the Hunter Valley to green hydrogen, and to  build the  world’s biggest electrolyzer manufacturing plant in Queensland.

The Vistra Energy Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility Phase II set off fire alarms just after 8 p.m. (PST) on Feb. 13. Upon arrival, the local fire department found roughly 10 battery racks that were completely melted. The fire department representatives said that the fire was extinguished.
“We could confirm that it does have a fire suppression system, that the fire suppression system activated, and actually extinguished or cooled the batteries to the point where there wasn’t any flame or fire,” North County Fire District Chief, Joel Mendoza told local media outlets.
Vistra Energy later released an official statement on its website. The company says the onsite fire suppression systems performed as required, at least in the sense that the fire incident was isolated.
The California ISO energy website does show a drop in battery output at 7 p.m., local time. There is no indication this is related to the Moss Landing facility.
Vistra has suggested that the event might be a similar event to a September incident that took down the first phase of the facility. According to a statement from Vistra, that incident involved a cascading series of events which may have started with the failure of a ball bearing in a fan.
The suspected bearing failure is presumed to have set off the very early smoke detection apparatus (VESDA), which in turn armed the heat suppression system. Vistra stated that due to “failures of a small number of couplings on flexible hoses and pipes,” water sprayed directly onto additional battery racks, causing short circuiting and arcing, which damaged the batteries and made more smoke. The additional smoke set off more alarms and caused even more water to spray from the failed couplings.
While the cascading events following the smoke detection can be seen in the data, investigators have not explicitly determined what set off the smoke alarm in the first place.
Vistra says that they had been bringing the first facility back online incrementally, but have now decided to pause those activities. Pv magazine was not able to confirm whether any of the larger facility’s capacity has come back online.
