The module and cell manufacturer operates five production hubs across four Chinese provinces, with a cumulative shipment record exceeding 30 GW, including 14 GW of cells and 12 GW of modules distributed worldwide.
TCL Zhonghuan says it plans to generate CNY 13.8 billion ($1.92 billion) via a private share placement to build a 35 GW super-thin polysilicon wafer factory and a 25 GW n-type TOPCon cell plant in Guangzhou, Guangdong province. All solar cells produced at the factory will be supplied for Zhonghuan's PV module products.
Haitai Solar says it has canceled an investment deal in the city of Yancheng, Jiangsu province, for a 10 GW TOPCon cell factory, citing uncertainty over land-related concerns. Separately, it has signed an agreement with the city of Chuzhou, Anhui province, to construct the same 10 GW TOPCon cell factory, with the investment amount unchanged at CNY 5 billion (equivalent to $695 million).
Fujian Yongfu Power Engineering said it will work with a local partner to build a self-funded PV farm with a capacity of 95 MW in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Yongfu will contribute 87% of the total funding. The project is expected to take approximately one year to build, with a 20-year operational period.
Astronergy has secured TÜV Rheinland certification for its TOPCon modules, which feature zero busbar technology. The Chinese PV manufacturer has also produced the first n-type TOPCon PV cells at its 2 GW facility in China and has launched a 10 GW “third-phase” PV cell production line.
CEEC-ZTPC, a Chinese engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firm, has signed a contract with GameChange Solar, a PV tracker supplier, for a 560 MW project in Egypt.

The H2Hubs aim to collectively produce 3 million metric tons of hydrogen per year, contributing to nearly one-third of the 2030 US production targets. The funds will also support clean hydrogen storage, delivery, and end-use. The seven selected hubs are as follows: the Appalachian Hydrogen Hub between West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania; the California Hydrogen Hub in California; the Gulf Coast Hydrogen Hub in Texas; the Heartland Hydrogen Hub between Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota; the Mid-Atlantic Hydrogen Hub between Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey; the Midwest Hydrogen Hub between Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan; and the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub between Washington, Oregon, and Montana. The H2Hubs selectees are investing $40 billion.
The Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) – in cooperation with RMI, Systemiq, Power2X, and industry leaders – has set up the Transatlantic Clean Hydrogen Trade Coalition (H2TC) to enable the initial shipment of clean hydrogen from the United States to Europe by 2026. H2TC will provide members with access to regulatory and infrastructure requirements analysis, supply and demand matching, and integration with capital markets. The coalition seeks to connect US fuel producers with heavy-industry consumers in Europe, facilitating the first shipment of clean hydrogen-based fuels by 2026. Their aim is to expand transatlantic trade to 3 million metric tons per year by the end of the decade.
ITM Power says it will launch bidding on projects in the US market, offering its electrolyzer stack for both CE and ASME territories. The UK electrolyzer producer says it will pursue a streamlined, asset-light entry into the US market, capitalizing on existing relationships in North America. By standardizing production processes and supply chains, it aims to simplify operations and achieve economies of scale.
SSAB, LKAB, and Vattenfall have completed a month-long commercial test of Hybrit's hydrogen storage on the electricity market. Vattenfall stated that by introducing storage, the variable cost of hydrogen production could be significantly reduced, by 25% to 40%. The mission aimed to produce hydrogen using fossil-free electricity at varying electricity prices, optimizing cost-effectiveness, especially during times of abundant weather-dependent electricity generation. The hydrogen was continuously supplied to SSAB for fossil-free iron production in Luleå, Sweden. The hydrogen storage facility, operational since the summer of 2022, will continue testing activities until 2024. This pilot plant measures 100 cubic meters and contains hydrogen gas pressurized up to 250 bars.
Portugal‘s Secretary of State for Energy and Climate, Ana Fontoura Gouveia, has announced an upcoming auction for green hydrogen and biomethane injection into the natural gas grid, with expectations of the European Commission's opinion on the Portugal, Spain, and France green hydrogen corridor project in November.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/17/german-energy-supplier-switches-on-20-mw-river-heat-pump/,"HEAT PUMPS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 17, 2023",German energy supplier switches on 20 MW ‘river’ heat pump,"MVV Energie AG has switched on an industrial heat pump at a coal-fired power plant operated by Grosskraftwerk Mannheim AG (GKM) in Mannheim-Neckarau, Germany.
The German energy supplier said the new system is integrated into a district heating network and is one of the largest such systems in Europe. The heat pump uses water from the Rhine River and has a thermal output of 20 MW. It will provide heating for 3,500 households. Siemens Energy supplied the heat pump technology and GKM integrated it into the infrastructure of the large power plant for MVV Energie.
MVV Energie said that the water of the Rhine River in Mannheim is up to 25 C in summer and only around 5 C in the winter. This thermal energy is sufficient to evaporate the refrigerant in the heat pump and reduce the temperature of the Rhine River water by around 2 C to 5 C.
The refrigerant vapor is then compressed using an electrically powered compressor to increase the pressure and temperature. The heat generated by the refrigerant vapor is transferred to the district heating water through condensation in a heat exchanger, producing hot water at temperatures ranging from 83 C to 99 C.
The refrigerant liquefies and expands again in the heat exchanger. It then cools down and absorbs thermal energy from the river water at a low temperature to restart a new cycle.
“The heat pump works on the same principle as the home refrigerator,” MVV Energie said in a statement. “While the heat energy of the refrigerator is released from the inside to the outside, the heat pump uses the heat to heat the district heating water.”
The project is part of the “Large heat pumps in district heating networks” initiative, which is funded by the Germany Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection (BMWK),
“The MVV project shows that heat pump technology also works in XXL format to provide climate-neutral supply to entire city districts,” said Thekla Walker, the minister of energy for the German state of Baden-Württemberg. “The river heat pump is an important building block for our country in reducing its dependence on fossil fuels step by step.”

The Chinese manufacturer said the new inverters feature a switchover time of less than 10 milliseconds, guaranteeing a smooth transition to backup power. The devices can also handle a 200% emergency power supply (EPS) overload for up to 10 seconds and can be paired with a wide range of loads.
“The X3-Ultra is designed to seamlessly integrate with all types of PV panels, allowing for a maximum 36 A DC input per MPPT,” the manufacturer said. “This ensures optimal performance and compatibility with a wide range of solar setups.”
The new product has dimensions of 696 mm x 529 mm x 240 mm and weighs 47 kg. It is offered in five versions, with rated power outputs ranging from 15 kW to 30 kW.
The hybrid inverters also offer battery voltages ranging from 180 V to 800 V and a maximum charge/discharge current of 60 A. Solax said its dual battery ports provide the flexibility to connect batteries either separately or in parallel for various energy storage configurations.
The inverters can allocate power independently to each phase, with control down to 0 W per phase, offering a maximum of 10 kW output on a single phase. Solax said that the X3-Ultra can provide 100% unbalanced output, permitting feed-in power down to zero on each phase.
The new inverters also feature isolated sampling, arc fault circuit interrupters, and surge protective devices on both the AC and DC sides.
“The inverter also boasts Intelligent Loads Management, extending support to electric vehicles and heat pumps, making it a forward-thinking choice for the modern energy landscape,” Solax said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/17/australian-researchers-achieve-lithium-sulphur-battery-breakthrough/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 17, 2023",Australian researchers achieve lithium-sulphur battery breakthrough,"From pv magazine Australia
A team of researchers from Monash University’s Faculty of Engineering have developed a new lithium-sulphur (Li-S) battery design featuring a nanoporous polymer-coated lithium foil anode that “significantly” improves the number of times the battery can be cycled.
Lead researcher Declan McNamara said when compared with similar coated lithium anode systems, the polymer coating cell has exhibited outstanding performance across a range of metrics.
“This coating is a step towards highly efficient, easily manufactured Li-S batteries,” he said.
Li-S battery technology continues to prove popular among researchers and commercial developers, with the potential for the metallic lithium and sulphur combination to deliver more energy per gram than lithium-ion batteries.
The technology does however have its limitations. Typically, Li-S batteries contain a lithium anode (negative electrode) and sulphur cathode (positive electrode) with a separating layer. When the battery charges and discharges, the lithium and sulphur react which leads to the formation of polysulfides, rapidly reducing the battery performance.
“Metallic lithium is a bit of a double-edged sword,” McNamara said. “Lithium is packed full of energy, but in a bad battery, this energy is wasted on side reactions. On the other hand, if the energy is channelled correctly, it can make some incredible energy storage devices that are easier to make.”
In this new battery configuration, the researchers at Monash have coated a lithium foil anode with a nanoporous polymer which they say allows the lithium ions to move through while protecting the anode from corrosive sulphur compounds.
“The polymer contains tiny holes less than a nanometre in size, one billionth of a metre, which allow lithium ions to move freely while blocking other chemicals that would attack the lithium,” McNamara said. “The coating also acts as a scaffold for lithium, and helps it charge and discharge repeatedly.”
In their paper, the researchers said that the polymer coated anode had exhibited improved capacity retention over 275 cycles, adding that the new design reduces the amount of lithium required in a single battery and does not require nickel or cobalt, removing the need for minerals that have a significant environmental and social cost.
Mainak Majumder, from Monash’s Faculty of Engineering, said these developments are promising steps toward more widespread adoption of Li-S batteries and other lithium metal-based energy storage systems.
“The study establishes a new framework to protect Li-metal from rapid decay or catastrophic failure which has been an Achilles heel for Li-S batteries,” he said.

The United Kingdom government’s U-turn on some of its net zero commitments has placed an even greater emphasis on the role local authorities can and must play in creating a cleaner, healthier environment.
Members of the Key Cities network have shown a high level of ambition and proactive action in terms of achieving net zero, with many developing strategies, forming strong partnerships between community and private enterprise, and delivering successful projects across various sectors.
Crucial to these efforts is the development of sustainable energy. One technology which has attracted the attention of our Key Cities members has been solar power. Along with wind, solar offers the promise of renewable, sustainable energy and the creation of the infrastructure needed to collect and channel it is almost certain to lead to the creation of thousands of new, well-paid jobs.
Like many people, members of the Key Cities network were interested to hear, earlier in the year, of government plans to back technology which would, in effect, collect energy from the sun out in space using satellite-mounted panels and beam it back down to Earth.
It will doubtless take years to develop but as scientists work on this and other schemes to develop much-needed sustainable energy security, closer to home, Key Cities members have been making their own contribution toward greening our energy and power networks.
As spelled out in our “Levelling Up, Emissions Down: Accelerating Net Zero across the Key Cities” report, the United Kingdom has made significant progress in lowering carbon dioxide emissions in the last 30 years, with a reduction of 73.4% between 1990 and 2021, largely as a result of the closure of coal fired power stations and increased investment in low-carbon energy sources such as solar, wind, and nuclear energy.
There is still much work to be done but many of our network members have already embraced the challenge of creating more sustainable energy solutions. As well as having a significant environmental impact in these areas, these examples highlight the potential of solar power, should it be adopted more widely across the country. The English city of Wolverhampton has worked with the its local National Health Service hospital trust to install a 6.9 MW solar farm on a former landfill site to direct renewable energy to the hospital, meeting 70% of its electricity needs. In the English town of Blackpool, a major solar farm located alongside the city’s airport will provide sustainable energy to a nearby business enterprise zone.
In the Welsh city of Newport, a partnership with the Sustainable Communities Wales initiative driven by environmental charity Severn Wye and the Wales Cooperative has ensured 2,000 solar panels will be installed at the Geraint Thomas National Velodrome. This is expected to reduce the city council’s carbon emissions by 348 tons per year and will generate 1,973,MWh of electricity annually.
Funding secured through United Kingdom government body the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme (PSDS) has enabled the English metropolitan borough of Salford to install 2,562 solar panels on 21 public buildings across the city, generating 778 MWh per year. Four sites have also had battery energy storage systems installed and the 3.79 hectare Little Hulton solar farm, also funded through the PSDS, will triple energy generation.
These are encouraging examples but challenges remain. According to national electricity network operator National Grid, the United Kingdom government’s target of 50 GW of offshore wind by 2030 will require six times the amount of transmission infrastructure that was delivered in the past 30 years.
Local projects also require changes to the grid. One city in the Key Cities network is aiming to deliver 300 MW of renewable energy to meet its net zero targets; to date it has delivered 50 MW, with another 100 MW in the pipeline. Without an upgrade to the grid, however, it is unable to deliver more than this until post-2028 at the earliest, which will result in the city being unable to meet its net zero targets.
The path to net zero is not only being driven by a need to address the encroaching climate crisis. Net zero solutions increasingly offer returns to the economy, over and above the economic benefits of preventing global warming. For example, renewable energy generation increasingly competes in cost terms with fossil fuels while the prices of solar and onshore wind have fallen by 88% and 68%, respectively, since 2010.
Investing in net zero solutions will have a range of other economic and social benefits, including job creation, improved energy security, and improved public health due to a fall in air pollution. Clearly, the road to net zero is not only essential to prevent climate change, but also to support the economies of places around the United Kingdom.
While local authorities are making significant contributions to achieve net-zero, greater autonomy through devolved powers and funding would significantly expedite progress and help overcome challenges such as capacity building across councils and the clarification of roles in the national net-zero transition. This is where the power of the network comes in, enabling Key Cities to harness the talents of both the community and the private sector, leading the charge towards a sustainable energy network and a climate-conscious future.

“Existing fault detection techniques detect faults after their occurrence,” the research's lead author, Ihsan Ullah Khalil, told pv magazine. “Our proposed fault forecasting technique forecasts the fault so that predictive maintenance can be assured. It uses the rate of change of solar cell parameters to identify which fault is occurring.”
According to Khalil, solar cell parameters start changing even before a fault occurs. “The IV curve is divided into 172,000 data points, so we get 172,000 values of I and V,” he further explained. “Then, by using each value of I and V, and the values of Im and Vm, we extract the same number of values for each solar cell parameter. Finally, we model the rate of change of each variable for the first 100 data points. For the first hundred data points, I and V are almost the same up to the first decimal point.”
The proposed algorithm is claimed to be able to extract cell parameters at either no faulty conditions or faulty conditions and to sense fault at its inception level.
Machine learning-based regression techniques are used for the model, which the scientists said is able to detect variation trends of each parameter against each fault at the inceptive stage. The algorithm initially models the initial trend against a single voltage, current, and power value. It then splits the data set and models the variation of solar cell parameters using four variants of linear regression. “Linear regression has given excellent results,” Kahlil said. “One of the major contributions is introducing a lemma for the fault index formula that is not been discussed in the literature before.”
The scientists claim that the results demonstrate that the solar cell extraction method they used offer superior performance compared to existing forecasting techniques, as it analyzses the variation in cell current and voltage for the detection of faults at an incipient stage. “The significance of the proposed algorithm rests in its early fault detection capability, which contributes to the development of adaptive protection systems for photovoltaic installations,” stated the researchers.
Their findings were introduced in the study “A novel procedure for photovoltaic fault forecasting,” published in Electric Power Systems Research.

However, integrating BIPV into design is not easy, given the vast range of data and technical factors to be considered and the difficulties that designers and developers face in choosing and sourcing materials.
“BIPV design and management is a complex process which involves requirements geophysical, technical, economical and environment factors throughout the life cycle of the system, ranging from acquiring architectural visual effects to higher solar insolation in given location, efficient energy generation and economic operation and maintenance of the BIPV system,” Rebecca Yang, a researcher for RMIT’s Solar Energy Application Group, told pv magazine. “Lack of consideration for PV integration of the building envelope in the early design phase is one of the main reasons for complicating the design and construction process of BIPV systems.”
Yang has led the development of a new tool, BIPV Enabler, which is the first of its kind to combine BIPV product, regulation, technical, economic and construction data. The tool was developed with Australian data and features maps, a 3D shape library, solar visualizations, hourly weather data and pricing information for materials and feed-in tariffs.
“The Zero Carbon Australia Buildings Plan promotes BIPV to reach a full uptake on suitable buildings by 2030. BIPV is at Technology Readiness Level 9, but adoption has been slow in Australia because it reframes distributed solar energy as a building product which needs close collaborations between the PV and building industries,” Yang said. “It is difficult to develop a business case for a BIPV project without accessible information and value-for-money solutions.”
Yang said that BIPV Enabler is the perfect solution for building designers and developers looking to select the right solar option, be it for a new build or an existing building, by retrofitting BIPV.
“We’re making integrated-solar a more attractive option to developers, slicing the time it would normally take to research and implement incognito solar devices,” she said. “Our software aims to translate technical complexities into a packaged, user-friendly platform that integrates product, technical, economic and construction data to create the best BIPV solution for individual building projects.”
Yang, the director of the Australian PV Institute and head of the BIPV Alliance, said that the platform serves building professionals in making design choices and enables PV suppliers to showcase the value of their products to clients.
In BIPV Enabler, users have several key functionalities. They include the ability to select building types and project locations with an interactive map. Users can also create building models using the 3D geometric building shapes library or default arch and draft workbenches within FreeCAD. In addition, the platform allows users to visualize the solar irradiance on the building envelope.
Users can also choose BIPV modules from the product database, which enables the generation of a comprehensive report on the energy output of the BIPV designs. This report encompasses economic and environmental considerations. Users can perform both automatic and manual placement of the BIPV modules to suit their specific needs.
Another valuable feature is the ability to estimate wind loads for BIPV design, ensuring safety and effectiveness. Lastly, the platform allows users to optimize their BIPV designs, taking into account factors such as tilt angles, BIPV product options, window-to-wall ratios, and distance-to-length ratios.
The BIPV product database consists of records of about 80 Australian and international BIPV modules. The data are presented with 13 major attribute categories and 136 sub-attribute categories of BIPV products based on local and international building design codes and construction-related regulatory requirements.
The database contains information on the cost of BIPV modules, including their maintenance expenses. Users can choose to create customized BIPV modules if they prefer. Users additionally have the flexibility to select one or more BIPV modules for either the economic analysis or the optimization process.
The BIPV modules can also be organized based on parameters such as the module technology, transparency, color, patterns frame type. The most dominant module technology in the BIPV Enabler database is mono-crystalline, followed by copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe). More than a half of the products are colorful.
The software, funded by RMIT and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, was initailly announced last year and opened to users mid this year. “We provide a one-year usage for free at this stage,” Yang said.
She claimed that with minimum effort and some funding support, the RMIT team could redesign BIPV Enabler to cover other countries. It is now on the lookout for such collaborative opportunities.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/17/new-system-design-for-spectral-splitting-concentrator-agrivoltaics/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 17, 2023",New system design for spectral-splitting concentrator agrivoltaics,"Researchers at the University of Science and Technology of China have developed a new system design for spectral-splitting concentrator agrivoltaics (SCAPV)
The system is based on the spectral separation of sunlight based on the difference in the spectral response of photovoltaics and photosynthesis. According to this principle, red and blue wavelengths are used for photosynthesis as they match the absorption peaks of plant chlorophyll, while all other wavelengths are used for concentrated power generation.
In the study “Large-scale and Cost-efficient Agrivoltaics System by Spectral Separation,” published in iScience, the scientists explained that the proposed system utilizes a dual-axis tracking technology with concentrator modules that optimize the cell components and the concentrating curve.
The 10 kW system occupies a surface of 400 m2 and consists of 128 concentrator modules, each integrating an ultra-white and toughened concentrating curved glass (CCG), a multilayer polymer film (MPF), which the researchers said is the key component for achieving spectral separation. Furthermore, 23%-efficient interdigitated-back contact (IBC) crystalline silicon solar cells with a concentration ratio of 6% were provided by Sunpower.
“These cells were cut into 1/3 strip PV cells (41 mm × 125 mm) and then connected in series using ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) along with PV glass and a backboard, resulting in the formation of PV modules consisting of 24 such strip PV cells,” the scientists said, noting that solar cells with a higher concentration ratio would have resulted in higher system costs. Their selection process also took into account the spectral shift characteristics of the MPF, processing cost, module size, and holder height.
The concentrator photovoltaic panel consists of a back side receiving concentrated sunlight from the concave screen and a front side receiving direct sunlight. The tracking system uses two motors to control the angle of the spotting module for both azimuth and altitude angle tracking.
“The concentrator modules on the entire main beam square tube are driven via a drive shaft,” the researchers explained. “Integral brackets on the lower part of the concentrator module support the weight of the concentrator modules and wind/snow loads, and the weight is transferred to the primary beam through the north-south swing arm rotation shaft and the swing arm weldment.”
The SCAPV system was placed horizontally at a height of 2.5 m to allow small farm machinery to pass below it.
The system was tested in outdoor conditions in Anhui, China, and was found able to produce 107 MWh of electricity per hectare. Its overall system efficiency reached 11.6%, which the scientists said is the highest efficiency ever recorded for the spectral separation technology.
“Field planting experiments showed that five crops (ginger, peanut, sweet potato, bok choy and lettuce) had an average yield increase of 18.4% under SCAPV compared to open-air systems,” stated the research group. “The microclimate at the bottom of the SCAPV system, especially the soil moisture retention capacity in the daytime, was better than in the open air.”
The scientists believe that the costs of the system may decrease by 18.8% if around 1 GW of SCAPV capacity is deployed globally. They noted that the cost of the MPF currently accounts for around 50% of the system costs.
“Nevertheless, the laboratory's four-pronged plan – mass production of an autonomous film processing process, optimization of mechanical structures, development of lightweight modules, and the realization of scale effect – points towards heightened economic viability,” they concluded.

The company says it expects to produce 500 MW of its gallium-doped monocrystalline PERC silicon panels and TOPCon panels in 2023, expanding up to 1 GW in 2024.
 
The company's CEO, Mr. Yasin Guclu, says, “With its vast landscapes, diverse energy needs, and growing environmental consciousness, the United States offers a unique stage for Energate’s sustainable energy solutions.”
 
Energate Solar is one of Turkiye’s leading manufacturers in the photovoltaic panel production industry. The company currently has a production capacity of 1 GW at its two facilities in Kayseri, Turkiye, for solar modules ranging from 370 W up to 670 W in size.
 
The modules have efficiencies between 20.87% and 22.56% for products with monocrystalline half-cut cells and between 21.03% and 22.47% for TOPCon products. Energate’s half-cut panels are available in monofacial, bifacial, and full black options.
 
Guclu says a second manufacturing facility will be established in the West Coast region of the US in 2025 with an initial capacity of 1 GW, so that the company will have a total of 2 GW capacity in the country by the end of 2025. The establishment of the facilities on the East Coast and West Coast are two of the company’s three investment plans for the US. The third investment plan is to start production of solar cells in the country. He adds, “Energate Solar can embrace a pivotal role in shaping renewable energy trends in the US. This venture isn't just about boosting the company's success; it's about driving broader adoption of clean energy solutions on a grand scale.”

In the week of October 9, solar energy production decreased compared to the previous week in the main European electricity markets. The largest drop, 23%, was registered in the Portuguese market. In the other markets, the drop in solar energy production ranged from 19% in Germany to 8.1% in Italy.
Despite the weekly drop in solar energy production related to the seasonal change, when comparing solar photovoltaic energy production in the first half of October 2023 with the same period in previous years, since 2019, the record was broken in all analyzed markets.
During the first half of October 2023, the highest photovoltaic energy production, 2036 GWh, was registered in the German market, an increase of 5.4% compared to the same period in 2022 and 62% compared to 2019. In Mainland Spain, photovoltaic energy production for the first 15 days of October 2023 was 1613 GWh, an increase of 37% and 286% compared to the same period in 2022 and 2019, respectively. The lowest production, 160 GWh, was registered in Portugal, but still represented an increase of 33% compared to 2022 and 228% compared to 2019. For the week of October 16, according to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s solar energy production forecasts, solar energy production is expected to decrease in the analyzed markets.


In the case of wind energy production, the week of October 9 brought a week‑on‑week increase in most of the markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting. The largest increase, 51%, was registered in the French market. In this market, 261 GWh was generated with wind energy on Friday, October 13, which is the highest value registered since the beginning of August. In the other markets, the increase ranged from 8.6% in Germany to 43% in Italy. The exceptions were the markets on the Iberian Peninsula, where overall wind energy production fell by 12% compared to the previous week.
For the week of October 16, AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s wind energy production forecasts indicate that wind energy production will increase in all analyzed markets, except for Germany.

Electricity demand
During the week of October 9, electricity demand increased compared to the previous week in most of the main European markets. Increases ranged from 0.6% in the Belgian market to 6.2% in the German market. In the case of Germany, the rise was related to the recovery of the labor rate after the previous week’s celebration of Germany’s Unity Day on October 3. Something similar happened in Portugal, where Portugal's Republic Day was celebrated on October 5, which favored a 5.3% increase in demand in that market in the second week of October.
On the other hand, demand fell in only two of the main European electricity markets. In Spain, the drop was 7.6%, and it was related to the celebration of Spain's National Day on Thursday, October 12. Demand also fell in the French market, in this case by 0.6%.
During the same period, average temperatures fell in most of the analyzed markets, ranging from 2.0 C in Great Britain to 0.1 C in Germany and Italy. The exception was France, where average temperatures increased by 0.4 C compared to the first week of October.
For the week of October 16, according to AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s demand forecasts, electricity demand is expected to increase in most of the main European markets, with the exception of Germany.

 
European electricity markets
During the week of October 9, prices in all European electricity markets analyzed at AleaSoft Energy Forecasting rose compared to the previous week. The largest percentage price rise, 70%, was reached in the Nord Pool market of the Nordic countries, while the smallest increase, 1.7%, was registered in the EPEX SPOT market of the Netherlands. In the other markets, prices increased between 5.0% in the EPEX SPOT market of Germany and 20% in the IPEX market of Italy.
In the second week of October, weekly averages were below €95/MWh in most of the analyzed European electricity markets. The exceptions were the Spanish, Italian and Portuguese markets. The Italian market reached the highest average, €145.30/MWh. In the case of the MIBEL market of Portugal and Spain, the averages were €125.39/MWh and €125.41/MWh, respectively. In contrast, the lowest average price, €9.25/MWh, was reached in the Nordic market. In the rest of the analyzed markets, prices ranged from €77.92/MWh in the German market to €90.55/MWh in the N2EX market of the United Kingdom.
Despite the increases in weekly average prices, in the second week of October, negative hourly prices were registered in the German, Belgian, British, Dutch and Nordic markets, influenced by high wind energy production values. The lowest hourly price, ‑€7.10/MWh, was reached in the Dutch market on Sunday, October 15, from 14:00 to 15:00.
But in the second week of October hourly prices above €200/MWh were also registered on several occasions in most of the analyzed European markets. This was also the case on Monday, October 16 in all analyzed markets, except for the Portuguese and Nordic markets. On that day, the highest hourly prices were registered from 19:00 to 20:00 CET. In the German, Belgian, French, Italian and Dutch markets, a price of €240.00/MWh was reached. In the case of the French and Italian markets, this price was the highest since August 24. On the other hand, in the case of the Spanish market, an hourly price of €220.00/MWh was reached on October 16 from 19:00 to 20:00 CET, which was the highest price since the end of January. On the same day and hour, the British market also reached the highest hourly price since January, at £241.19/MWh.
During the week of October 9, the rise in the average price of gas and CO2 emission rights, the increase in demand in most markets and the general decline in solar energy production led to higher prices in the European electricity markets. In the case of the MIBEL market, wind energy production in the Iberian Peninsula and nuclear energy production in Spain decreased, contributing to the increase in prices.
AleaSoft Energy Forecasting’s price forecasts indicate that in the third week of October prices in most of the main European electricity markets might continue to rise, influenced by declining solar energy production and increasing demand in most markets. In the case of the German market, the decline in wind energy production might also exert an upward influence on prices.
Brent, fuels and CO2
Settlement prices of Brent oil futures for the Front‑Month in the ICE market remained above $85/bbl during the second week of October. The weekly minimum settlement price, $85.82/bbl, was registered on October 11. On the other hand, the weekly maximum settlement price, $90.89/bbl, was reached on Friday, October 13. This price was 7.5% higher than the previous Friday.
In the second week of October, concerns about the impact of the Middle East conflict on oil supply and OPEC’s global crude oil demand growth forecasts exerted their upward influence on Brent oil futures prices. However, data showed an increase in crude oil stocks of the United States that exerted some downward pressure. On the other hand, in the second half of the week, the United States started to impose sanctions on tanker owners carrying Russian oil at a price higher than the maximum price imposed by the G7, which might also have an impact on supply.
As for settlement prices of TTF gas futures in the ICE market for the Front‑Month, they increased during the second week of October. On Monday, October 9, the weekly minimum settlement price, €43.95/MWh, was reached. This price was already 12% higher than the previous Monday. The weekly maximum settlement price, 53.98 €/MWh, was reached on Friday, October 13. This price was 41% higher than the previous Friday and the highest since mid‑February.
In the second week of October, prices were influenced upward by supply concerns due to instability in the Middle East, labor disputes at Australian liquefied natural gas export facilities and a pipeline leak in the Baltic Sea. In addition, the forecast of cooler temperatures in Europe also contributed to price increases, as these would favor an increase in gas demand for heating.
Settlement prices of CO2 emission rights futures in the EEX market for the reference contract of December 2023 remained above €80/t during the second week of October. The weekly minimum settlement price, €81.75/t, was registered on Monday, October 9, and it was 1.2% higher than the previous Monday. Subsequent price increases led to a weekly maximum settlement price of €85.95/t, reached on Friday, October 13. This price was 6.8% higher than the same day of the previous week and the highest since the end of August.

Task 1 of the IEA PVPS focuses on Strategic PV Analysis and Outreach. For 30 years, the Trends in PV Applications Report offers a comprehensive view of the PV market, policies and key industry developments globally, and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. It is designed to assist those who are responsible for developing the strategies of businesses and public authorities, and to support the development of medium-term plans for electricity utilities and other providers of energy services. It also provides guidance to government officials responsible for setting energy policy and preparing national energy plans. has been recently published.

Market Volumes: A Symbolic Milestone
As the PVPS Trends report reveals, the PV industry has achieved a significant milestone, crossing the 1-terawatt (1 183 GW) cumulative capacity mark. This achievement marks a symbolic turning point in the journey towards sustainable energy. Two thirds of all existing PV plants have been installed in the past 5 years.
In 2022, the annual capacity reached an impressive 235.8 GW, a new record, which could have been even higher, with grid connection issues and lack of installers slowing down the development of PV in numerous locations. Notably, China contributed 45% of this capacity, with the European Union following at 17%. The growth was not limited to these regions alone, as strong expansion was witnessed globally, with a 35% increase in annual capacity compared to 2021. Entering the list of the Top 10 annual PV markets wasn't solely confined to large countries or populations, as demonstrated by the Netherlands, which installed more than 3.9 GW of capacity (see Figure 2). However, the PV market is still concentrated in a dozen of countries globally, with a lot of additional potential for market development.
Image: IEA-PVPS
The report shows that PV capacity was evenly spread between distributed and centralized systems, despite variations in different countries and regions. Some countries, (India, the USA, Spain), showed a dominance of centralized systems, while China exhibited a more balanced distribution. Recently developed markets continue to start with utility-scale development while regulations for distributed systems are more complex to put in place. While the global PV market was on an upward trajectory, some countries experienced slowdowns due to supply issues, grid congestion, and labor shortages. These challenges are expected to persist in certain regions, emphasizing the need for strategic planning to address these issues.
Competitiveness Amidst Challenges
Because of the high cost of electricity in Europe and other locations, caused by events including the Ukraine war, the competitiveness of PV continues improving. Some support mechanisms, for example contract-for-difference arrangements, generated revenue for state governments, buoyed by these high electricity market prices. The Trends report also highlights the continued growth of prosumers (consumers, who are producing part – or all – of their own electricity consumption) policies, underlining the resilience of the PV market.
Industry Investments and Challenges
The PV industry witnessed significant investments in new silicon, cell, and module manufacturing capacity, with at least 700 GW of module manufacturing capacity. Governments around the world (USA, Europe, China, India) are actively supporting local manufacturing and trade conflicts and labor concerns are influencing manufacturing support. The rapid scaling of manufacturing outpaced market development, which resulted in significant module price drops in 2023 due to massive oversupply. With markets developing slower than needed, overcapacities in the industry will cause significant damages to many players and delay the roll out of much needed local manufacturing.
Social acceptance and grid Capacity: two Growing Concerns
As PV volumes surge, grid capacity is becoming a concern in some countries. While some nations are responding with substantial investments in transmission infrastructure, others are using curtailment and other measures at the distribution level. This comes in parallel with increased social acceptance, mostly related to centralized systems, issues which are delaying PV uptake in several key countries.
Conclusion: Shaping the Future Together
The IEA PVPS Trends Report not only provides valuable insights into the current state of the PV industry but also highlights the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. As we celebrate the symbolic milestone of 1 TW of cumulative capacity, market development to reach climate change goals needs more support from policymakers and energy stakeholders. With a wider gap between market and production, a period of lower prices might accelerate PV development, while challenges remain numerous to ensure long term development.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/17/european-parliament-committees-approve-draft-regulation-on-forced-labor/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,EUROPE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 17, 2023",European Parliament committees approve draft regulation on forced labor,"The Internal Market and International Trade Committees of the European Parliament have approved and amended a draft regulation against forced labor prepared by the European Commission. The proposal covers all products and does not target specific companies or industries.
“The draft regulation would put in place a framework to investigate the use of forced labor in companies’ supply chains,” the European Parliament said. “If it is proven that a company has used forced labor, all import and export of the related goods would be halted at the EU’s borders and companies would also have to withdraw goods that have already reached the EU market.”
The members of parliament approved the draft regulation and also made amendments. For instance, the revised version now requires companies operating in high-risk areas, rather than public authorities, to demonstrate that they do not use forced labor.
It also says that prohibited products can re-enter the EU market if the related producer can prove they have ceased using forced labor in their operations or supply chain. The committees also harmonized the definition of forced labor with the International Labour Standards.
“The ban that we have voted for today will be essential in blocking products made using modern slavery and taking away the economic incentive for companies to engage in forced labor,” said co-rapporteur Samira Rafaela. “It will protect whistle-blowers, provide remedy to victims, and defend our businesses and SMEs from unethical competition.”
The European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC), which recently urged the European Union to adopt legislation against forced labor in the PV industry, welcomed the vote. However, it said that it is concerned that it will take too long time until the legislation is enforced.
“We are afraid it will not be as effective as needed,” the association said in a statement.
The ESMC is an industry association that was created in 2019 with the aim of promoting the interests of the European PV manufacturing sector.

Alexis Issaharoff, the chief renewable energy officer for Jubaili Bros, said that the sustainable solar house is designed to teach children and adults about sustainability and renewable energy.
Issaharoff, a renewable energy expert with more than 16 years of executive experience and a board member of sustainability and environmental foundations, also contributes to the United Nations magazine “UN Today.”
He developed the project to educate children and adults about renewable energy, sustainability, regenerative agriculture, and water conservation through the construction of a LEGO kit.
“How could we get parents and kids to learn about something that would benefit them both? By playing together,” he told pv magazine.
After 11 months of work, Issaharoff brought the Sustainable Solar House to life with 4,100 virtual pieces. He entirely developed the project with LEGO Ideas software.

The house is designed to be self-sufficient, producing its own food, water, and energy, making it a ‘Net Zero Plus' House that generates more energy than it consumes. It achieves this through a rooftop solar array featuring bifacial modules with a tracking system and integrated solar modules on the house's facade (BIPV).

The house incorporates a solar cooker, a rooftop solar thermal system to supply hot water, and micro wind turbines. It uses a heat pump for air conditioning.

The house features a battery system, and its exterior and street lighting operate on solar power. It includes rainwater collection, wastewater recycling, a biodigester, and a recycling center.


The roof demonstrates the cooling mechanisms of the house through its use of solar modules (heat absorption), gardens and farming (heat absorption and utilization), and white paint (heat reflection, reducing heat absorption by the house).

The project also includes an organic solar tree, a solar delivery drone, and a solar robot, all integrated into the design.

The absence of a car in the house is due to the expectation that cars will become self-driven in the next decade. They will be readily available 24/7 on the road, as depicted by the red car in the image. There is also a dedicated lane for self-driven electric school buses and cars equipped with wireless electric chargers on the side. To accommodate alternative transportation, there is also a designated lane for bikes, electric bikes, and electric scooters.
The project has undergone actual wind environment studies by environmental design and engineering firm Neapoli.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were also used to analyze indoor and outdoor conditions in the LEGO house, optimizing ventilation and natural cooling for the summer season.

If ‘The Sustainable Solar House' receives 10,000 votes, LEGO will evaluate the possibility of producing it as a real kit. There are more 100 days remaining for voting.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/17/suniva-plans-3-5-gw-us-solar-cell-factory/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 17, 2023",Suniva plans 3.5 GW US solar cell factory,"From pv magazine USA
Suniva has announced plans to restart solar cell manufacturing, after years of lobbying to restrict global solar panel imports into the United States.
Remarkably, it did not resume production even after succeeding in securing tariffs in February 2018. Nor did it make any moves during the record-breaking years of 2020 and 2021 for solar deployment. But in 2023, the company finally broke its silence.
“The Inflation Reduction Act [IRA] and its domestic content provisions, as issued, provide a strong foundation for continued solar cell technology development and manufacturing in the United States,” Suniva CEO Cristiano Amoruso said in a press release.
Suniva plans to reactivate and expand its facility in Norcross, Georgia. It aims to kick off production by spring 2024 with a 1 GW capacity, eventually scaling up to 2.5 GW per year. Earlier this year, Suniva secured $110 million in financing from Orion Infrastructure Capital, which also partnered with Heliene for a $170 million manufacturing expansion.
Although the IRA appears to have fueled the current US solar manufacturing boom, it’s not the only factor. Existing tariffs, and import restrictions, have inflated prices in the domestic solar module market. However, historical data provides valuable context.
Despite past tariffs, the US solar market expanded. The tariffs first imposed in 2012 and 2014 by the Obama administration aimed to counter economic espionage by Chinese military hackers against SolarWorld, the theft of monoPERC technology, and the dumping of solar cells.
According to data from Clean Energy Associates, US solar manufacturing continued to decline after tariffs were introduced, but saw a modest uptick later. Peaking in 2019, 19.8% of all US solar installations used domestically produced modules, according to the Coalition for a Prosperous America.


In that year, the United States deployed 13.3 GW of solar panels, with about 2.6 GW sourced from domestic manufacturers that had approximately 8 GW of available capacity. However, in the following two years, as the US market rebounded and set annual records, the share of modules manufactured domestically started to decline relative to the total number of modules installed.
