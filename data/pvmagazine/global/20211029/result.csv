ZeroAvia is collaborating on the project with Royal Schiphol Group and Rotterdam The Hague Innovation Airport.
A group of 10 researchers has demonstrated a hydrogen (H2) refueling solution capable of delivering pre-cooled, compressed gaseous hydrogen for heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) refueling applications by refueling transit buses over three months under real-world conditions. “The system uses a submerged pump to deliver pressurized liquid H2 from a cryogenic storage tank to a dispensing control loop that vaporizes the liquid and adjusts the pressure and temperature of the resulting gas to enable refueling at 35 MPa and temperatures as low as −40° C, consistent with the SAE J2601 standard,” reads the abstract of the paper, “Liquid pump-enabled hydrogen refueling system for heavy duty fuel cell vehicles: Fuel cell bus refueling demonstration at Stark Area Regional Transit Authority (SARTA)”. The paper will be published on November 11 in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. The researchers used 13 vehicles, completing 118 individual bus fillings. “In our final test, the system successfully completed an endurance test using a single dispenser involving 52 consecutive individual fills over an 11.5-h period, dispensing 1,322 kg of H2 with an average fill rate of 3.4 kg/min and peak rate of 7.1 kg/min, and reaching an average SOC of 97.6% across all fills.”
UK research firm Wood Mackenzie reports that Northeast Asia and Europe are expected to become the main hydrogen importers, accounting for 55% of seaborne hydrogen trade, whereas Australia, the Middle East and, possibly, Russia and the U.S. have the greatest export potential. As a result, hydrogen demand could rise by six-fold to 530 Mt in 2050. “Several countries are hoping to benefit from developing export-oriented hydrogen megaprojects, with blue and green hydrogen projects being developed in Russia, Canada, Australia, and the Middle East. In the burgeoning green hydrogen space, nearly 60% of proposed export projects are located in the Middle East and Australia, principally targeting markets in Europe and Northeast Asia. Over the last 12 months, there has been a 50-fold increase in announced green hydrogen projects alone,” reads the analysis. The consultancy said that experience in exporting natural resources, suitable conditions for low-cost renewable electricity, and the potential for large-scale carbon capture are the three key factors for green hydrogen, adding that Brazil, Chile and Kazakhstan are joining the hydrogen race. Russia and Canada have significant potentials in terms of blue hydrogen, it added. “While no two hydrogen export projects look the same, the most obvious difference in proposed projects is between blue and green hydrogen. But portraying this as an either-or choice is an over-simplification,” Vice Chairman Gavin Thompson said, explaining that exporters will focus on a variable mix of the two. The costs of green hydrogen production, “typically more than three times higher than those of blue hydrogen”, are expected to fall, but “cost declines will not be uniform”. The consultancy did not elaborate on CCUS costs in the analysis. In general, Wood Mackenzie sees Australia in a leading position. “Australia, in particular, stands out from the crowd in its track record of exporting a diverse set of natural resources and minerals, sheer physical scale, solar and wind resources and substantial potential for large-scale CCS,” commented Wood Mackenzie research director Prakash Sharma.
U.S. hydrogen solutions company Plug Power and French renewable hydrogen startup Lhyfe signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to jointly develop green hydrogen generation plants throughout Europe. “The initiative seeks to generate a total hydrogen capacity of 300 MW by 2025, and to start the development of a 1 GW production site,” the companies announced Wednesday. “In North America, we’ve already built a robust ‘hydrogen highway,’ which includes 165 hydrogen fueling stations and stationary power for businesses and institutions, a success we plan to replicate in Europe,” commented Plug Power CEO Andy Marsh. The companies are already working on a 1 MW hydrogen production facility off the coast of Le Croisic, calling it the world’s first offshore hydrogen production facility. Lhyfe has subsidiaries in Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and Spain.
Denmark's Green Hydrogen Systems has as part of a consortium signed a €30 million grant agreement with the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA). The goal of the project is to demonstrate 100 MW of green electrolysis production at the GreenLab industrial park in Skive, Denmark, that can be replicated in the rest of the world, the company said, adding that the electrolyzer module will be demonstrated by the end of 2022. Green Hydrogen Systems has been granted €9 million to develop the test 6 MW module, which is subject to later qualification for a 100MW solution, the company added. Danish green hydrogen infrastructure company Everfuel will oversee the task of scaling the project commercially. French group Lhyfe will supply the control system for the 100 MW plant. Throughout the GreenHyScale project, a 7.5 MW high-pressure electrolyzer for offshore application will be developed. The facility is set to begin operation at the end of 2025.
Meanwhile, ahead of COP26, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reports that several institutions have thrown their weight behind hydrogen, mostly to send clear signals to the private sector, and create collaboration forums. “Over 50 member countries convened today in a Collaborative Framework on Green Hydrogen co-facilitated by Morocco and the European Commission,” wrote IRENA last week, adding that the new Enabling Measures Roadmap for Green Hydrogen will serve as a vehicle to further enhance public-private dialogue. Also last week, the Energy Community Secretariat joined the new Ready for Hydrogen (Ready4H2) initiative powered by distribution system operators (DSOs) from 13 European countries. The Energy Community is a Vienna-based organization aiming to extend the EU internal energy market to southeastern Europe and beyond.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/29/focus-cop26-how-can-africa-attract-more-solar-investments/,"MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,NORTHERN AFRICA,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA",,"OCTOBER 29, 2021",Focus COP26: How can Africa attract more solar investments?,"Africa will be high on the agenda when political leaders and climate negotiators meet at COP26 in early November. No doubt, we will hear strong appeals to put more money on the table to finance clean energy in the south, as well as promises from the rich world to do so. This is important, but Africa doesn’t have to wait for more pledges to attract capital for green energy investments.
Billions of private and public dollars stand ready to invest in solar and other renewable energy projects in Africa. Governments should focus on lifting barriers holding back such investments, both for large-scale power plants and distributed solar plants which is the focus of this article. In a nutshell, these barriers can be summarized as regulation, subsidies, and currency.
Africa’s businesses suffer from the world’s highest electricity costs, and the continent is the only region where the share of renewables in the energy mix has been at a standstill since the signing of the Paris Agreement six years ago. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the share of hydropower, solar, and wind on the continent’s electricity generation is still below 20%. As a result, Africa has become even more dependent on coal, natural gas, and diesel to meet its fast-growing demand for power – fuels that recently have doubled and even tripled in price.
To reverse this precarious development, Africa should aim to triple annual investments in low-carbon energy to at least US$60 billion per year. A major share of these investments will be required to finance large utility-scale solar projects. But equally important are investments for much faster deployment of solar and storage in the private sector. Africa’s governments should study the lessons learned from South Africa and Egypt, and make it easier for businesses to invest in solar energy production for their own needs.
A case in point is one of Empower New Energy’s investments that has now been in operation for over a year. This 0.7 MWp rooftop solar plant in Accra was made possible through a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the client, a local manufacturing company in Ghana.  The tariff paid represents a saving on the energy bill of 20%, and the 800 MWh of clean energy produced equals 400 tonnes of CO2 emissions avoided. In addition, new jobs are created during construction, operation and maintenance as well as indirectly through the improved competitiveness of the client.
Unfortunately, regulation prohibits energy users in most African countries – with the exception of Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, and a few others – from buying solar energy from private providers as in the case cited above. (In Ghana, the possibility is limited to large energy users, so-called “bulk customers”.) For most African countries, the only solar investment option with private off-takers is to enter into a rental or lease-to-own contract. Contracts, where the users pay for the equipment, are generally perceived as less attractive to the energy user than contracts where the client pays for the electricity delivered, which is most commonly used worldwide.
A second regulatory barrier that hinders solar investments in Africa is the absence of net metering. With the notable exception of South Africa, Egypt, and a couple of other countries, energy users in Africa have no possibility to monetize surplus electricity. In most parts of the world, energy users produce their own electricity under net-metering contracts with local distribution companies. This means that in periods when the captive power plant is generating more electricity than needed, during maintenance or holidays, for example, the energy users can “sell” surplus electricity back to the local utility company. The absence of net-metering means that the energy user needs to pay for all unused solar electricity, making the solar investment less attractive.
Subsidized diesel prices and grid tariffs are also a barrier to solar investments, but fortunately less so than before. The cost of diesel in Egypt and Nigeria, for example, is USD 0.5 – 0.6  per liter, about half the price in the U.S. and China, and less than a third of the price in Europe. Only by eliminating fossil fuel subsidies and making sure tariffs cover all costs can governments ensure that solar energy projects will become fully competitive. There are more efficient ways than fuel subsidies to protect the poor and vulnerable parts of the population.
Finally, currency is also a major issue, especially since African countries need to attract billions of dollars in foreign investments. Foreign investors are generally not set to uptake currency risk, offtakers neither. Furthermore, in some markets such as Nigeria, Mozambique, Zimbabwe a.o, access to the U.S. dollar is highly restricted, making foreign investments almost prohibitive. A liquid currency market and a stable and transparent foreign exchange policy are vital for countries seeking solar investors.
What should be done at COP 26, to bring about the urgent need for more solar power to Africa? Supporting governments that seek to make it attractive for businesses to procure their own solar energy is important. More funding to providers of guarantees and soft loans is also vital. But we should be more ambitious. My wish for the Glasgow meeting would be a global agreement to replace the expired CDM (Climate Development Mechanism) with a new, automatic, and unbureaucratic carbon credit for all distributed renewable energies in developing countries. A floor price of, say $30 per ton CO2, would unlock thousands of additional solar investments across Africa, replacing millions of liters of fossil fuels while at the same time creating more than a million new jobs in the countries most in need of a post-Covid jab to the economy.

Mexico's largest event for the PV industry — Solar Power Mexico — will take place at the Centro Citibanamex in Mexico City from 9 to 11 November.
The details of the exhibition and its series were presented in an online press conference that was held yesterday morning.
“In the current situation that the national and international energy agenda is experiencing, the main goal of Solar Power México is to help the country take advantage of its full renewable energy potential through technology transfer and specialized knowledge, the generation of business and investment opportunities,” said Thorsten Hofmann, the director of the fair. “It also wants to provide an ideal space to enable decision-makers to discuss the energy policies necessary to turn Mexico into a global solar energy hub.”
“We join this initiative to develop knowledge, the best proposals and promote political dialogue around innovation and sustainable development in order to seek technical solutions, viability of public policies,” said Hans Blomeier, director of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Mexico.
Israel Hurtado, president of the Mexican Hydrogen Association, said the organization is currently seeking to be part of the solution in the fight against climate change, the promotion of renewable energy sources, the energy transition, and the path towards a circular and hydrogen economy. “Solar Power Mexico may gather all those involved in developing solar energy and hydrogen in Mexico,” he affirmed.
During the virtual conference, it was reported that the event will see the participation of 100 exhibitors from Mexico and other regions presenting the technological innovations and trends in the industry. The conference program will offer more than 40 panels and workshops.

Chinese media reported that Tesla ordered 45 GWh of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from Chinese battery producer CATL. The batteries reportedly will be used for the automaker’s Model 3 and the Model Y.
The reports calculated that the 45 GWh would be enough to support production of 800,000 vehicles, which is more than Tesla’s sales through the first three quarters of 2021 (625,000 units). The news outlet pegged the battery capacity of the two models at 55 kWh and 60 kWh.
On October 28, CATL broke ground on a new lithium-ion battery production base in Yichun, east China’s Jiangxi Province. The first phase of the project involves an investment of around $2.1 billion to build a 50 GWh lithium-ion battery production base.

All the projects are located in China's northern and northwestern provinces of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai and Shaanxi. Gansu is expected to host five projects totaling 12.85 GW and Qinghai 15 projects with a combined capacity of 10.9 GW. There will be around 2 GW of PV projects planned for the deserts of Inner Mongolia, and another 2 GW for Ningxia and Shaanxi, respectively. Most of these renewable energy projects will integrate wind power, solar PV, storage, and ultra-high voltage grid for connection and inter-provincial transmission. Some of the projects will include hydrogen generation and storage.
Module maker Risen Energy announced on Thursday that it will sell a solar park located in Australia, the Merredin Solar Farm, to Solar United Network Pte. Ltd. The total transaction value is around AUD186 million ($139.9 million). The solar farm is located between Perth and Kalgoorlie, and was connected to the grid in August. Risen said the deal would generate a net profit of RMB43 million ($6.7 million).
Chinese electronic engineer TBEA announced on Thursday that it wants to invest in four PV power plants with respective capacities of 102 MW, 50 MW, 80 MW and 20 MW. All the facilities will be located in northwestern China. The company will invest a total of RMB1.45 billion ($227 million) in the four projects — RMB770 million, RMB205 million, RMB363 million, and RMB114 million, respectively.
Glass maker Flat Glass Group announced on Wednesday that the company has purchased two quartz mines thanks to an investment of of RMB2.65 billion ($414 million). Located in Anhui province, the two quartz mines have estimated quartz assets of around 21 million metric tons and an annual supply capacity of 2.4 million metric tons of high-quality quartz.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/29/high-module-prices-make-italy-an-early-victim-of-supply-chain-disruption/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,ITALY",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"OCTOBER 29, 2021",High module prices make Italy an early victim of supply chain disruption,"Italy is the first European country to pay the consequences of the reduced production of solar modules because of the large demand fluctuation over the last months, but the mismatch between supply and demand is progressively becoming global, experts told pv magazine during the third day of the Key Energy event in Rimini, Italy.
“We observe challenges regarding module supplies, to some extent regarding batteries too,” Paolo Rocco Viscontini, president of trade association Italia Solare, told pv magazine. “It is easier to buy inverters, at least for now.”
The pandemic-related logistical complexities, exacerbated by a series of factors in spring, affected the availability of modules, inverters, and batteries. The difficulties to source modules in the market then intensified over the last four months.
Operators, developers, and producers at the trade fair expect the trend to continue, at least till spring. “The delivery of large quantities of unplanned, not ordered modules has to be expected in spring,” Viscontini explained, adding, however, that even large planned orders are sometimes not carried out due to the complexities in the supply chain.
There are fewer module producers at the fair than usual, visitors reported. Chinese module maker JA Solar is one of the very few producers with a stand.
“The problem is that the cost of the materials, particularly silicon, has increased because of the policy in China, where most of the modules come from,” Alastair Mounsey, JA Solar's country manager for the UK, Italy, and France, told pv magazine. China is trying to match energy supply and demand, overcoming the difficulties stemming from a global shortage of natural gas and coal, he explained. “The government had to take action to reduce energy consumption for two reasons: to reach climate targets and more importantly to have energy security for the core industry and the population.”
Mounsey reported that silicon prices went up also for signed deals, which meant that module producers lost money for existing contracts. “All the profit is in the silicon supplier. They have a higher cost, but they are also keeping the profit. As you go down the supply chain towards the cells and the modules, the profit level is very low. It only takes a small cost increase to lose money. When you start losing money in production, you stop producing as much.”
Another problem is that producers often cannot even buy raw materials, which forces them to reduce production even more, Mounsey added.
“Now the situation is becoming a bit more clear and the modules are steadily coming into the market,” he said. Meanwhile, installers expect problems on the supply side, triggering a rush, which is further deteriorating the situation. “It is a bit like the petrol crisis in the United Kingdom,” he stated.
Mounsey agrees with Viscontini on the expected positive developments in spring, but not with the usual prices and under pre-crisis conditions. “There will be a new normal by March, April, meaning that by then you will have information. But we are not going back to the normal low price: we are going to a new, higher normal,” Mounsey said, adding that the availability disruption will equally continue for five or six months. “In terms of capacity, it is not going to be full capacity at least going into Q2, middle of Q2,” he added.
Italy recently passed a series of incentive schemes that increased the expectations for the PV market and created mixed signals. The main scheme has a limited length. According to developers and producers, this created an incentive for distributors to stockpile modules in their Italian warehouses at the beginning of the summer. Several developers explained to pv magazine that they received lower offers from distributors than from producers for the same modules.
“If we go back to six months before, the demand for modules was very high. Then over the summer, everyone in the market was nervous to get the modules. After the summer, I think, Italian buyers realized that they had a lot of modules on the Italian market, while installations were not quite as quick as they expected. Around Q3, they stopped ordering so many modules. Then the crisis happened in China, buyers saw the prices going up, new production prices being 3 to 4 cents above what they have paid. There was a lot of panic in the market,” Mounsey explained.
The lack of a clear long-term planning, combined with very strong temporary incentives, created disruption and triggered confusion, he noted. Producers could not understand the demand side.
“Maybe it is possible that the uncertainty of how the eco-bonus and the super-bonus are running creates a distortion,” Mounsey emphasized, noting that these high fluctuations in demand are not typical of other markets. “Markets hinging on pure grid parity, like private PPAs, are affected by the higher price, but it is a problem that is going to come later. In Italy, they made it harder earlier.”
His comments were in line with other signs. Other module producers at the fair declined questions on the situation, but indicated that their production capacity might be at least equally affected. The supply of modules is still a pressure cooker.
At the Rimini fair, operators said the supply chain also affected batteries, whereas inverters are still available on the market under “normal” market conditions.
Italian energy storage company EEI, whose supply chain is based on a partnership in China, reported that they had no problems delivering batteries. “Speaking about batteries, challenges to the supply chain occurred from May/June through August. Component availability on large volumes is problematic, but it's an issue that can be resolved very quickly. Issues were related mostly to logistics,” Andrea Praticò, EEI's energy storage team leader, told pv magazine.
According to Praticò, logistic complexities were due to a series of events. “Suez created a three-to-four-week delay, but the real problem was related to the blockage of certain ports in China.” He explained that their large warehouses in China have simplified their logistic processes and planning. The company also decreased risks by over-ordering materials when the first signs of market stress emerged.
“The battery cells are produced by Catl, and they are assembled in China, where we produce batteries also for other big players,” Praticò explained. “For now, they say they have not been late with deliveries of batteries.”
Some inverter producers still lamented delays in deliveries of batteries, suggesting that less integrated storage companies tended to suffer more.

Thanks to its relative abundance and its importance to the semiconductor industry, silicon is still the most practical material to work with in large-scale production of solar cells. The structure of a silicon cell, however, means light is absorbed through an ‘indirect bandgap’ – meaning the material is relatively inefficient at absorbing sunlight.
A group of scientists led by the US Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory has theorized that by altering the structure of silicon to create an allotrope – the same element in the same state, but with a different atomic structure – they could improve its light-absorbing characteristics, and performance as a solar cell.
The calculations are described in full in the paper Exceptional Radiation Absorption in a Pentagon-Based Si Allotrope, published in Nano Letters. In the allotrope, Si22, silicon atoms are arranged into a network of hollow, pentagonal structures. The structure is said to be thermally and dynamically stable, and able to directly absorb visible frequencies of light.
Aside from solar cells, the group also calculated that, thanks to the way it vibrates and its performance at very low temperatures, the allotrope could be a useful material for work in quantum computing.
The hollow structure could also be useful in incorporating other atoms – making it potentially interesting in energy storage applications, as well as in carbon sequestration – where the silicon structure would hold carbon atoms within it, keeping them out of the atmosphere.
The properties of this silicon allotrope, however, have so far only been calculated theoretically, and much more work will be required to confirm the behavior and the potential of this material in the ‘real world’. “[This research] has laid a foundation for the potential of the new material, and experimentation would need to follow up to further test the material’s properties,” reads a statement from LANL. “Designing and understanding the properties of the new material is the first step, and the first step is taken.”

Unlike other conventional methods to recycle silicon from PV devices, the new technique is not based on the use of highly toxic chemical hydrofluoric acid, which is commonly utilized in the PV industry for both quartz cleaning and wafer etching. In solar module recycling, the corrosive acid is used for separating silicon from the cell by removing the antireflecting coating, silver, lead, and p-n junction.
The corrosive acid was replaced by the Indian group with three different chemicals: a 10 M solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was applied to the aluminum layer for five minutes at 63 degrees Celsius; a 6 M solution of nitric acid (HNO3) was utilized to remove the silver electrodes and lead; and a solution of 90% phosphoric acid was used to remove the antireflecting coating based on silicon nitride (Si3NA4) for 45 minutes at 70 degrees Celsius.
The outer parts of a solar panel such as glass, ethylene-vinyl acetate glass, copper, steel, aluminum, and plastic were previously removed through thermal degradation.
According to the scientists, the proposed technique is able to deliver recycled silicon with a purity of up to 99.9984%. The recycling cost for 1 kg solar cell with this process is estimated at $68.9 and the total profit after recycling a 1 kg solar cell is calculated to be $185.4. The recovered silicon can be used to manufacture new solar cells or electronic components such as diodes, transistors, and microchips, they explained.
The recycling technique is also said to enable the recovery of aluminum, silver, and lead as aluminum hydroxide, silver chloride, and lead oxide, respectively. It is described in the paper “Recovery of Pure Silicon and Other Materials from Disposed Solar Cells,” published in the International Journal of Photoenergy.

The Indian Ministry of Heavy Industries has invited bids to develop a cumulative 50 GWh of advance-chemistry battery cell manufacturing units in India under its production-linked incentive scheme. The selected bidders will be supported with fiscal benefits in the form of cash subsidies for production.
To be eligible for the government subsidy, the bidders will have to commit to setting up an advance-chemistry cell manufacturing facility of between 5 GWh and 20 GWh capacity within five years from the date of appointment. They must also commit to a minimum 25% value addition to the projects within two years from the appointed date and a minimum of 60% within five years.
State governments will also provide incentives for the projects, through the execution of tripartite agreements they have with a special-purpose vehicle formed to set up the unit and the central government. The bids will be assessed based on technical evaluations, followed by financial considerations.
Bidders will be shortlisted based on the technical evaluation. In the second stage, a financial evaluation will be conducted based on the subsidy support sought by the bidder. The subsidy is capped at a maximum of INR 2,000 ($26.69)/kWh. Any bid quoting a subsidy of more than INR 2,000 will be rejected.
Bids will finally be ranked according to their combined technical and financial scores. The bidder with the highest combined score will be allocated the capacity first, followed by others, until a cumulative capacity of 50 GWh per year has been allocated.
The subsidy disbursement shall commence once the proposed committed capacity and value addition are achieved and the sale of the advanced chemistry cell begins. It shall be phased out over a five-year window, payable quarterly.
Bids must be submitted by Dec. 31, but technical bids will remain open until Jan. 3, 2022, and financial bids until Jan. 21. The letter of award will be issued to successful bidders on Feb. 4.

The procurement exercise's lowest bid of ZAR 0.34425 ($0.02279) was submitted for a 124 MW wind facility planned to be built in Hantam, in the Northern Cape region, while for the solar technology the lowest price was ZAR 0.37479 ($0.02481), which was offered for six 75 MW solar parks expected to be constructed in Tokologo, an administrative area in the Lejweleputswa District of the Free State region.
“The average price for the solar PV projects of $0.029/kWh is about 13% lower than the average price for the 12 wind farms, despite having a lower average size per project,” Chris Ahlfeldt, an energy specialist at Blue Horizon Energy Consulting Services, told pv magazine.”The average solar PV price would have been even lower if Eskom didn’t have to deal with transmission constraints in the Northern Cape which has the best solar resource.”
According to Ahlfeldt, only 2 of the solar PV projects from Round 5 will be built in the Northern Cape, while the rest will be located in other provinces across the country. “It will be interesting to see how these projects plan to meet socio-economic impact goals given the need for local job creation and economic development in South Africa which is still recovering from the COVID 19 pandemic,” he also stated.
The ministry had initially pre-selected 39 wind projects and 63 solar projects to compete in the tender.
Norwegian developer Scatec said in a press release it secured 273 MW of PV capacity in the procurement exercise. “Scatec will own 51% of the equity in the projects with H1 Holdings, our local Black Economic Empowerment partner owning 46,5% and a Community Trust holding 2.5%. Financial close is expected in the first half of 2022 with grid connection and commercial operation by the end of 2023,” the company stated, without providing further details.

Attaching a solar array to a home is a long-term commitment, with many considerations, and one that offers great potential for energy bill savings. A recent addition to the list of options is whether or not to attach a battery energy storage system.
A battery can often add $10,000 or more to the total cost of a residential solar system, according to EnergySage. But it comes with a range of benefits that vary depending on the home’s electricity needs and experience with the utility company. So, what are the benefits?
In part one of this two-part series, pv magazine reviews the benefit of backup power. In the next part, costs, benefits, and timing are evaluated.
Blackouts or power outages occur with varied frequency and for different reasons, depending on location. Some regions experience transmission issues on the grid, weather events can knock out power, and some regions like southern California have scheduled rolling blackouts during high energy-demand periods.
A SunPower-backed survey of 1,500 homeowners found that 40% of respondents worried about power outages on a monthly basis. And one-third of respondents said high-profile outages, like the ones caused by winter storms in Texas this past February, are the top reason for considering energy storage.
The next logical question might be: how much battery to install, and for how long should it provide backup?
Installers typically give the choice between whole-home backup, which often require the installation of multiple batteries, or a partial backup, which allows the homeowner to select specific circuits that are tied to desired appliances or outlets. When selecting specific breakers, homeowners often select the refrigerator, garage door opener, home office, or other kitchen appliances.
To understand a home’s power needs, and to evaluate what is most essential to back-up, homeowners can use the Department of Energy’s Energy Saver appliance energy calculator.
One of the most common home batteries is the Tesla Powerwall, which has a 13.5 kWh usable storage capacity. This means it can provide 13.5 kW for one hour, or 1 kW for 13.5 hours, said EnergySage. A second big energy storage brand is from LG Chem, which has  9.6 kWh and 16 kWh models.
Translated to appliances, EnergySage said 13.5 kWh is equivalent to running a 3,500 W air source heat pump for just under four hours, a 200 W refrigerator for 67.5 hours, or five 20 W light bulbs for 135 hours.
EnergySage said a PowerWall can typically back up essentials like WiFi, phone, refrigerator, and some lights for about 24 hours.
Simulations run by the Energy Department’s Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory of residential solar and storage systems operated for backup power purposes suggest that a system with a 7 kW pv array and 10 kWh of storage could support 60-80% of a customer’s average daily load over the course of a year, depending on the region.
Plus, if the sun is still shining, a battery-connected solar array will continue to produce and store electricity. Solar arrays without a battery must power down during an outage, for safety reasons. Without a battery to store the power, there is no safe place for the power to go, so the system must use a rapid shut down device (the grid is inaccessible as it’s being repaired).
Solar installers will typically work with a homeowner to determine backup needs, and will evaluate the readiness of the home’s main electrical panel to be integrated for backup. In some cases, the installer will call for a main panel upgrade to accommodate the battery, Doing this may come at an additional cost.
In part two, we look at other capabilities, consider costs/benefits, and look at the issue of retrofitting existing systems.

The result, which the company says also represents the world’s highest efficiency for a front-back contact (FBC) solar cell, was confirmed, once again, by Germany's Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH).
“The fill factor (FF) of the certified cells breached the threshold of 86%, reaching 86.59% and achieving the world’s highest level for silicon cells,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “A new process developed by LONGi’s R&D team can effectively reduce the contact resistance of the interface, so as to improve the FF and increase a cell’s current density.”
The cell also showed a current density of 40.49mA/cm². “The microcrystalline N window layer was optimized to further increase current density, with a new intrinsic layer structure developed to enhance passivation performance and increase the open-circuit voltage up to 2mV,” Longi further explained. “From 25.26% through 25.82% to the latest 26.30%, LONGi has now achieved the rare feat of setting HJT cell efficiency world records three times in six months.”
Longi had announced in July a 25.19% efficiency for p-type TOPCon solar cell and a month earlier a 25.21% efficiency for n-type TOPCon device.

Queensland’s largest solar farm, which forms part of Neoen’s Western Downs Green Power Hub and 200 MW/400 MWh big battery, has reached a significant milestone by finalizing its connection to Powerlink’s transmission network.
Neoen Australia Managing Director Louis de Sambucy said the completion of connection works marked an “important project milestone.” The solar farm is expected to commence operations in 2022.
“The team remains mobilised towards finalising construction over coming months and we’re looking forward to delivering affordable renewable energy to CleanCo and Queensland,” he said.
The 460 MWp solar farm, being developed on a 1,500-hectare site in Queensland’s Western Downs region, will generate 400 MW of solar energy, producing more than 1,080 GWh of renewable energy per year.
Powerlink CEO Paul Simshauser said grid connection works involved building new transmission lines and associated infrastructure at the network operator’s existing Western Downs Substation.
“This newly-built transmission line feeds into Neoen’s Hopeland Substation, which has also now been energized to help transport the renewable energy generated at the solar farm to the National Electricity Market (NEM),” he said. “We look forward to working with Neoen to undertake final testing and commissioning in coming months as solar farm development continues to progress.”
The massive Western Downs Green Power Hub has the backing of state government-owned renewable energy generator CleanCo, which has committed to purchasing 320 MW of the solar power produced. CleanCo Queensland Chair Jacqui Walters said the hub would add significant renewable energy capacity for Queensland, generating enough energy to power 235,000 homes while avoiding 864,000 tons of CO2 emissions.
“The 320 MW of solar energy we’ve secured from this project joins CleanCo’s unique portfolio of wind, hydro and gas generation and enables us to offer reliable, low-emissions energy at a competitive price for our customers,” she said. “We have a mandate to bring 1,400 MW of new renewable energy online by 2025 and through projects like the Western Downs Green Power Hub we will do this while supporting growth and jobs in regional Queensland.”
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the solar farm, which had sparked more than 450 construction jobs, is “further proof of Queensland’s credentials as a renewables and hydrogen superpower.” The project is part of Neoen’s ambitions plans to have more than 10 GW of capacity in operation or under construction by 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/29/sunman-unveils-430-w-glass-free-solar-module/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 29, 2021",Sunman unveils 430 W glass free solar module,"Chinese solar module manufacturer Sunman has launched a new panel series with a power output of up to 430 W.
“An innovation combining proven crystalline silicon solar cells with Sunman's patented composite material, eArc has the same durability and robustness of conventional glass modules,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “However, unlike glass, eArc is akin to a flexible ‘solar skin' that is 70% lighter and up to 95% thinner.”
The eArc SMF430F module is available in two versions with nominal power of 425 and 430 W and a power conversion efficiency of 19.0 and 19.3%, respectively. Its open circuit voltage is 49.6-49.8 V and the short-circuit current is 10.67-10.64 A.
The new product has a size of 2,125×1,051x35mm and weighs in at 11.2kg. It relies on 144 half-cut monocrystalline cells, a white backsheet, a frame made of anodized aluminum alloy, and a junction box with an IP 68 rating.
The glass free panel can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,000 V and an operating temperature between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius. The power temperature coefficient is -0.38% per degree Celsius.
The new module, which comes with a 25-year linear power output warranty and a 12-year product guarantee, is manufactured through a process based on the use of glass fiber reinforced plastic (GRP), which the manufacturer says reduces light reflection and opens up new assembly options. As with other products from the company, the new panel can be bonded directly to curved roofs. 
“The eArc modules can be the way to make solar energy usable in the long term and economically, particularly in the case of existing buildings or areas that make conventional assembly uneconomical or, for example, impossible due to a load limit,” the manufacturer said in a statement released.

Electric utility Rocky Mountain Power (RMP) is incentivizing more than 50,000 residential and commercial solar power owners within Utah to install utility-managed sonnen batteries. The company will use the batteries as part of a virtual power plant.
RMP said it will pay solar owners a one-time incentive of $400 to $600 per kW of energy output capacity, based on when they installed solar power. After the larger first-year incentive is paid, the utility will pay an ongoing annual capacity payment of $15/kW.
RMP said it may trim these incentives as needed in the future. Here are the numbers, as provided by the utility.

The utility told prospective customers that it will not use the batteries from November through February, except for grid emergencies. From March through October, the utility may use the batteries daily, given high electricity demand conditions. In its FAQ, RMP stated that it will not discharge batteries below 10%, and also assured customers that it will not discharge customer’s batteries below 50% in the program’s first year.
The incentive program requires that the batteries be charged by the on-site solar power system in order to fully qualify for the 26% solar tax incentives; however, it did not specifically refer to any technical requirement to do so. The utility said that sonnen batteries are to be used in the program. Sonnen offers two batteries: the 10 kWh Core and the Eco. The Eco comes in two flavors, a 20 kWh Eco and a 30 kWh EcoLink.
The Core’s 4.8 kW output will earn an incentive payment of $1,920 to $2,880. The 3-7 kW Eco will earn $1,200 to $4,200, and an 8 kW EcoLinx will receive $3,200 to $4,800.
Sonnen was a logical choice for this program because it created one of the first virtual power plant (VPP) batteries, which launched the sonnenCommunity program. The company’s VPP first came to the United States in 2017 in an Arizona community.
The use of residential solar+storage as a power grid asset has been growing. Sunrun first broke through in 2018 by winning a bid for its projects to be part of the ISO New England capacity market. Since then there have been a number of announcements, including $500,000 saved during heat waves, Tesla in California, and the ConnectedSolutions program in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
As the United States recently passed 3 million solar panel installations, it only makes sense for publicly owned power grids to tap into resources owned by the public. In fact, research from Vibrant Clean Energy suggests that hundreds of billions can be saved by fully realizing the value of distributed solar+storage through 2045.
This is, of course, before we consider the value of resilience to local business and homeowners. The Texas grid collapse in February that killed hundreds, and the ongoing challenges in California have spurred consumer demand for home energy storage.
