“Considering the advantages of low cost, high material stability, tunable bandgap, and high industrial compatibility of CZTSSe solar cells, we believe this solar cell has a promising commercialization prospect, such as BIPV and other suitable applications,” researcher Dongmei Li told pv magazine.
The scientists explained that selenization annealing is a key process in the development of highly efficient kesterite solar cells. In this step, tin(II)sulfide (SnS) is generally added but an excessive presence may result in defects in the CZTSSe absorber.
They also claim to have regulated the kinetic process of phase evolution by tailoring a positive chamber pressure to reduce selenium (Se) partial pressure.
“The collision probability between the precursor and gaseous Se molecule can be decreased at the heating-up stage (200 C to 400 C) of the selenization reaction,” they explained, noting that this has contributed to the reduction of bulk defects by around one order of magnitude.
The research team built a kesterite cell with an interfacial layer made of molybdenum (Mo), the kesterite absorber, a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, a window layer of zinc oxide (ZnO), and an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. They finalized the manufacturing process via the thermal evaporation of nickel (Ni) and aluminum (Al) top electrodes and an antireflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2).
The device has a power conversion efficiency of 14.13%, an open-circuit voltage of 551.20 mV, a short-circuit current of 35.74 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 71.73%. They also internally certified the cell efficiency at 13.8%.
“The highly efficient kesterite solar cell also shows excellent long-term stability in ambient environment without encapsulation,” the academics stated.
The group introduced the cell technology in “Control of the phase evolution of kesterite by tuning of the selenium partial pressure for solar cells with 13.8% certified efficiency,” which was recently published in Nature Energy.
“This work provides a kinetic regulation strategy for further understanding and regulating the phase-evolution process of kesterite, especially optimizing the phase-evolution path to achieve highly efficient kesterite solar cells,” the scientists said. 
Kesterite is one of the most promising light absorber material candidates for potential use in lower-cost thin-film solar cells.

Sinn Power, a German startup specializing in floating PV, has presented its new SKipp mobile, tiltable photovoltaic solution.
The new product does not have to be anchored in the ground and is therefore particularly suitable for deployment in nature reserves and water-protection areas, where no ground anchoring or piling is permitted.
According to Sinn Power, its solar modules remain upright even in strong winds. The modules can be tilted and feature a pendulum weight to ensure they return to their vertical position, even in windy conditions.
“Tipping over can be ruled out, even without anchoring the modules to the ground,” the manufacturer stated.
Systems using this product can use bifacial solar modules oriented vertically in an east-west direction. This boosts output, especially during morning and evening hours, compared to traditional southern-oriented photovoltaic systems. The system also produces more solar power in winter, like other vertical PV installations deployed at high latitudes.
“With SKipp, we have redesigned open ground-mounted and agrivoltaic systems,” explained Philipp Sinn, founder and managing director of the German company. “This photovoltaic solution meets the highest technical requirements and at the same time offers our customers maximum flexibility and optimal electricity yield in terms of location and duration of use.”

Vivasvan Solar, based in India, has created a foldable solar structure that can efficiently power water pumps for irrigation by easily moving within or between farms. The system, which consists of PV panels and a variable frequency drive, is mounted on a trolley.
“In Sangli district, a farmer can have two-three sources of water for irrigation, such as a borewell, open well, and an artificial pond. Our mobile system with variable frequency drive is compatible with different solar pumping solutions, providing farmers the flexibility to pump water from any of these water resources on their farm,” Rahul Chavan, director at Vivasvan Industries OPC, told pv magazine.
Transporting portable solar systems can lead to the development of microcracks, particularly on rough, uneven terrains of the field. To address this concern, Chavan noted that spring suspension has been installed on all four corners between the panel arrangement and the trolley platform, with a rubber dampener lining between solar module frames. These act as shock absorbers to avoid damage to the panels. Additionally, the PV panels use a frame made from mild steel that was developed in-house.
Vivasvan Industries has already installed its portable solar structure on a farm at Kharsundi in the Sangli district of Maharashtra. The PV system consists of 15 Axitec 335 Wp panels. Chavan said that the system can be customized from 1 kW up to 7 kW on a single trolley.

It is successfully coping alone with rapidly increasing levels of solar and wind and is finding it to be remarkably straightforward and cheap.
For northern latitudes, there is excellent wind (mostly offshore). Densely populated regions such as Japan and Indonesia have enormous offshore wind and solar resources respectively. Europe will benefit from terawatt-scale transmission interconnection to carry offshore wind from the North Sea to the south, and southern winter solar to the north.
Currently, Australia procures 38% of the electricity in its National Electricity Market from renewables, mostly from solar and wind. The government target is 82% renewable electricity by 2030 (Figure 3). Australia is finding the task of managing high levels of solar and wind to be easier and less expensive than many people anticipated.

The state of South Australia (population 1.7 million) is tracking toward 100% solar and wind in 2027 on an annual basis (Figure 3). South Australia is relatively weakly connected to other states. Additional gigawatt-scale transmission is under construction, which will allow South Australia to export substantial amounts of solar and wind electricity to the eastern states.

The solar and wind fraction for the month of December 2022 was 85% (Figure 4), with an average price on the spot market of AUD 55 ($37)/MWh. The South Australian grid is highly stable and generally delivers lower electricity prices than other states. South Australia provides compelling evidence that solar photovoltaics and wind is cheaper than fossil gas generation.

Australia does not have any nuclear or geothermal generation and low capacity for hydroelectricity (about 6% of annual generation). Virtually all new generation capacity in Australia is solar and wind.
Energy storage is a solved problem. Australia has three existing pumped hydro energy storage systems. Two new systems are under construction (Snowy 2.0 and Kidston) that have more energy storage than all the utility batteries in the world put together.
Australia (population 26 million) has about 15 GW of pumped hydro that has been announced by the governments of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, with about 700 GWh of combined storage. None involve new dams on rivers. Multi-gigawatt-scale investment in batteries and thousands of additional kilometres of gigawatt-scale transmission is in progress.
Australia is demonstrating straightforward solutions to variability of solar and wind and offers an economically compelling model for rapid removal of fossil fuels from electricity generation.
Solar and wind comprise three-quarters of new global generation capacity (Figure 5). This is compelling market-based evidence that they are the cheapest method of electricity generation. Coupled with the “electrification of everything,” they can do the heavy lifting to reach zero emissions before mid-century. Balancing techniques are off the shelf, comprising storage, transmission and demand management.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/04/20/the-green-jobs-promise/,"EMPLOYMENT,EVENTS,FINANCE,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,TEXAS,UNITED STATES",,"APRIL 20, 2023",The green jobs promise,"From pv magazine Global 04/23
Not all green jobs are created equal but they all address the equity dimension of a just transition. With women representing 32% of the clean energy workforce – more than the 21% present in the fossil fuel industry – there is hope of gender parity. But we need a shift from job quantity to quality and a new way of talking about green employment.
“Houston, we have a problem,” is how the energy transition was framed at the recent CERAWeek, the annual energy conference organized by US-based financial information company S&P Global. The words were uttered by Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and president-designate of this year’s COP28 climate summit, to be held in the United Arab Emirates. That warning should resonate with a global economy that has reached peak oil.
It caused me to reflect on my move from big oil to the huge global potential of renewables as I attended CERAWeek for my second visit to Texas – arguably the world’s energy capital. My choice was less about leapfrogging the energy transition – the topic of my panel session on finance in emerging markets – and more about finding co-benefits instead of trade-offs in my search for regeneration.
CERAWeek is traditionally a tough crowd for energy transition messaging but recent analysis by sustainability research body the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) has spelled out the bare facts: The energy revolution is being televised. We either wake up to that reality now or, as climate change’s impacts intensify, we will soon find out we’re living in a nightmare.
While climate change can sometimes feel like watching “Titanic,” the energy transition is not a movie. And yet, as we’re coming out of Oscars season, it’s worth noting it took films such as “Hidden Figures,” and “The Boy That Harnessed The Wind” to shed light on the key role African-American women played in the moon landing and how a young boy from Malawi imagined a world independent of oil.
Industries such as solar, and fossil fuel-dependent communities may share frustrations. The latter might feel invisible against a relentless energy transition promising, sometimes unconvincingly, like-for-like green employment. Solar proponents may be frustrated those with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics skills crucial for the clean power sector continue to be attracted to better-paid jobs in extractive industries.
The first International Energy Agency report on energy employment revealed more than half of the world’s power sector jobs are now in clean energy but the last International Renewable Energy Agency-International Labour Organization study reported only 12.7 million renewables jobs – 4.3 million in solar. We need 30 million this decade for net zero in 2050.
Appreciating green jobs are not created equally is the first step to understanding the hidden costs to communities of fossil fuel job losses. Similarly, highlighting the benefits of a just transition that goes beyond employment leads to new conversations about true regeneration of fossil fuel-dependent communities. In “Titanic” terms, it took a few shipwrecks for humanity to wake up to the peril of icebergs and the RMI’s green jobs report (see graph below) takes a similar approach.

But where are the icebergs ahead of us? Are they in Asia or Africa? What is beyond doubt is the dwindling role of fossil fuels in the face of a fast-accelerating transition driving the need for a flexible, adaptive global workforce. To adapt in a just, equitable way to a new world and changing climate, the energy transition needs to go well beyond “job incrementality.”
Through a broader lens, it is possible to see this radical energy shift calls for better alignment with worker expectations and needs. As the world increasingly moves toward a sustainable, and even regenerative economy, new opportunities will emerge in the remediation of degraded natural resources, adapting to a changing climate, and building circular material pathways. We also need to go beyond “job inequality,” as workers can then contemplate non-quantitative aspects of fossil fuel compensation: where those jobs are, how long they will last, and what they will pay both now and in a future of oil, gas, and coal stranded assets.
In the Global South, there are structural barriers to community investment that need to be overcome through financial de-risking and technical capacity building, so we must also go beyond how many green jobs are created, to focus on who they are being created for. Following Women’s History Month, I was pleased to see the conversation in Houston increasingly led by women. They represent the population segment most likely to benefit from green jobs, as data shows (see below).

Initiatives including the RMI’s Energy Transition Academy and the Women In Renewable Energy Network offer opportunities to expand the support given to those taking a leap of faith away from fossil fuels. We must find ways to increase the share of women taking technical and managerial responsibility, so they are in the driving seat.

The cell is based on TOPCon cell technology and has an area of 333.05 cm2. The previous world record of 724.9mV had been reported by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Germany.
“The achievement of an open-circuit voltage as high as 730mV for DAS Solar's TOPCon cells indicates a significant breakthrough in the development of passivation technologies, which holds great significance for the continuous improvement of TOPCon cell efficiency,” said Das Solar CTO Song Dengyuan.
“DAS Solar has successfully developed a new type of emitter layer surface passivation technology, called mt-Pass, which upgrades its N-type technology to TOPCon3.0 plus,” Das Solar said in an additional statement. “This mt-Pass technology significantly reduces the emitter's recombination current, which brings the passivation effect close to the backside SiO2/PolySi passivation technology.”

The agency will accept applications from May 2. It has allocated a budget of €3 million for the first round of the scheme. The call is open to homeowners, businesses, public organizations, and energy communities. In the last round of 2022, VEKA selected 169 projects with a combined capacity of 89.59 MW.
The scheme was introduced in January 2021, after the region’s net-metering scheme ended. For solar panels commissioned in 2023, the premium will be reduced to a maximum of €750. The contribution will be €150/kWh for the first 4 kWp and €75/kWh for 4 kWp to 6 kWp.
Flanders has the largest regional share of installed solar capacity in Belgium. The country's cumulative installed solar capacity hit 6.89 GW at the end of 2022.

Argentinean oil and gas supplier YPF Luz has inaugurated a 100 MW solar power plant near the town of Bella Vista, in the northern Argentinean province of San Juan, northern Argentina. The Zonda PV facility is the first phase of a 300 MW solar project that will be finalized at an unspecified later stage.
YPF Luz has invested around $90 million in the 100 MW plant. Part of this sum – $63.9 million – was raised by issuing a green bond.  Construction began in February 2022. The Zonda plant has a capacity factor of 36%, with 170,880 bifacial panels installed across 200 hectares.
The solar plant has already secured approval from Cammesa, the company that manages the country’s wholesale electricity market. It said it can begin operating the first 30 MW and “the last stages of commissioning are being completed so that it will soon begin to operate at 100%.”
The 300 MW project was selected by the national government in the first round of the RenovAr program. It was financed with funds from the Export-Import Bank of China, and a $210 million bond issued by the province of Jujuy, where it is located. Jemse owns an 80% stake in the project, with the remaining 20% split between Power China, Shanghai Electric, and Talesun.

The Australian unit of Philippines-based AC Energy says that work on its second large-scale solar project in Australia is set to commence in the coming weeks. It has called for interested parties to submit expressions of interest (EOI) for 14 new work packages that have now opened for the 400 MW Stubbo Solar Farm.
The project will feature more than 930,000 PV panels mounted on single-axis trackers spread across a 1,250-hectare site, about 10 kilometers north of Gulgong, New South Wales. Construction is scheduled to start in May, with works to be completed by May 2025. It is expected that the project will generate up to 400 jobs during the construction phase. Upon completion, it is expected that the facility will produce 1,000 GWh of renewable electricity each year – enough to power more than 185,000 homes.
The project also has development approval for a 200 MWh battery energy storage system. This will allow it to be adapted to dispatch energy during peak hours and provide critical grid stability services.
ACEN has awarded the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the Stubbo Solar Farm to the Australian unit of Canada-based PCL Construction. A connection agreement has been signed with infrastructure service provider Lumea and a PV module supply contract has been executed, but ACEN said this week that 14 new work packages have opened for EOI registration for the project.
PCL Construction said the main work packages include civil works, ground pile and mechanical installations, electrical installations, construction of the operations and maintenance facilities, the supply of cables and electrical equipment, and fencing installation. The tender process for the various scopes of works will continue into August.
The Stubbo Solar Farm is ACEN’s second utility-scale solar project in construction, with the 400 MW first stage of its planned 720 MW New England Solar Farm officially opening in March. ACEN said it has more than 1 GW capacity under construction, and more than 8 GW capacity under development.

The imaging and electronics company said that the electricity generated by the micro-hydro system could be used to power sewage plants.
“At this time, we have not conducted any testing regarding the combination of our system with PV or floating PV,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “However, we do believe that there is potential for PV to be combined with our system in the future, given the abundance of space available at sewage sites.”
The system features a water turbine that the company designed in collaboration with micro-hydroelectric system supplier Seabell Incorporated and the Kanazawa Institute of Technology. It consists of two generators mounted on a single unit, allowing efficient power generation. In addition, a waterwheel can be placed directly in the existing waterway, eliminating the need for a new bypass waterway. Ricoh provided its 3D printer technology to create the 3D-printed blades used in the system. These are made of biomass-derived materials.
“Compared to a water turbine made from commonly used 3D printer materials, our turbine is more than twice as strong as a metal turbine,” the spokesperson said. “Its strength was maintained even after being placed underwater for a long period of time and could be used for large-scale hydroelectric power generation.”
Ricoh conducted its first demonstration experiments at a sewage treatment plant in Shizuoka prefecture, Japan, in cooperation with Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT). The project is designed to address several issues regarding the use of micro- hydroelectric systems at sewage facilities. These issues include low turbine efficiency, low output, high upfront costs, and the intensive use of human resources.  The electricity generated by the micro-hydro system can be used for backup power supplies at disaster-prevention centers in sewage treatment plants. 
“The system will initially be sold in Japan but we are continuously exploring the possibility of introducing our technology in other regions, including Europe, the United States, and emerging economies,” said the spokesperson.
In March, Ricoh launched a pico-hydro generation system that can be used with factory drainage systems and irrigation canals.
“The system can also be used in combination with photovoltaics and batteries to ensure stable power supply, ” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “Depending on the amount of electricity generated, it can be used for IoT devices such as sensors, lighting devices, and charging systems.”

Ascent Solar, a US manufacturer of thin-film copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) solar modules, has agreed to acquire Switzerland-based thin-film rival Flisom for an undisclosed sum. Flisom currently operates a 15 MW factory in Zurich, Switzerland.
Ascent Solar will remain based in Thornton, Colorado, where it has a research and development center and 5 MW of nameplate production facility. It will immediately start manufacturing from its new roll-to-roll thin-film manufacturing facilities in Zurich, Switzerland. The Flisom deal will triple Ascent Solar's production capacity.
The company said the transaction is a significant milestone in its turnaround plan by delivering new committed contract revenue, increased production capacity, and an international foothold, as European and Asian governments adopt legislation to increase solar energy production and domestic manufacturing capabilities. The Flisom acquisition is also expected to provide Ascent with a new revenue stream in the luxury goods and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) markets.
Modern equipment at the Swiss facility will support Ascent’s focus on operational efficiency and optimization.
“Since coming aboard the company in September 2022, my priority has been to execute an aggressive turnaround plan and to re-establish Ascent as the leading provider of high-performance, flexible thin-film solar modules for use in scenarios where traditional rigid panels don’t work,” said Jeffrey Max, chief executive officer of Ascent. “We are seeing a global push for more solar power production and we have identified unmet demand for alternatives to traditional rigid panels that can be used in scenarios where land, form-factor, or weight constraints exist, particularly in Europe and Asia.”
