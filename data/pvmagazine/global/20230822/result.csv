AGL has turned on the second-largest operational battery in Australia at Torrens Island, just north of Adelaide. The 250 MW big battery is expected to play a critical role in transforming and supporting the reliability of renewables in South Australia.
AGL Chief Operating Officer Markus Brokhof said the battery, eclipsed only by French renewables developer Neoen’s 300 MW/450 MWh Victoria Big Battery, will provide additional firming capacity and flexibility for the grid.
“South Australia has the largest penetration of rooftop solar in Australia,” he said, noting that more than 70% of the state’s electricity is supplied by renewables. “This battery will respond to the requirements of the SA grid in milliseconds providing additional capacity and frequency control services when the system requires it.”
Sized at one hour storage but with the potential to extend the duration to four hours (1,000 MWh) in the future, the battery will initially operate in grid-following mode before transitioning to grid-forming mode (virtual synchronous generation).
“The technology which makes up this battery is remarkable,” Brokhof said.
AGL Chief Executive Officer Damien Nicks said the Torrens Island project forms part of the company’s broader ambition to have up to 5 GW of new renewables and firming in place by the end of the decade.
“This is a significant milestone in AGL’s transition journey as we continue to accelerate the build out of up to 12 GW of renewable and firming capacity by 2035,” he said.
“On this very site in the past four years, we have announced the closure of a thermal power station, built a flexible peaking plant and commissioned the second-largest battery in Australia. This is the energy transition in action. This battery is the second largest battery in Australia. It will provide enough electricity to power approximately 75,000 South Australian homes for one hour.”
Among the company’s other energy storage projects is a 50 MW/100 MWh battery under construction at Broken Hill in New South Wales, and a 500 MW/2 GWh battery planned for the Liddell power station site.
It is also planning a 500 MW battery with four hours of dispatchable capacity next to the Tomago aluminum smelter near Newcastle, and a 200 MW/800 MWh battery to be built at the Loy Yang A power station site in Victoria.

The project will be linked to a 10 MWh battery storage system.
LEC said that both facilities will be connected to the Schieffelin substation situated on the Elwa Highway. This highway serves as a connection between Monrovia and Roberts International Airport.
“The solar PV plant project aims to provide a quick and flexible option for constructing a PV and battery storage power plant and to give the country a low-cost, clean, and dependable power supply,” LEC said in a statement. “The plant is delivered on a flexible leasing arrangement with a five-year initial term.”
The solar facility will be the first large-scale PV plant in Liberia, if it is built.  However, the nation's progress in solar development has been quite restricted up to this point. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the country's cumulative installed PV capacity stood at just 3 MW at the end of 2022.
The country's initial attempt to install solar dates back to 2017. At that time, the government entered into an agreement with Israel's Energiya Global, allowing the Israeli company to secure funding and construct a 10 MW solar plant at Roberts International Airport.

The Chinese battery manufacturer said the Shenxing battery enables a 700 km driving range on a full charge. The performance level is a first for a battery with an output four times the rated ampere-hour rating of its maximum current (4C), according to the company.
Safety features include an upgraded electrolyte, a separator with a safety coating, and temperature-regulating algorithms.
At room temperature, the battery is said to charge to 80% state of charge in 10 minutes. In colder weather, when temperatures are as low as -10 C, its temperature control technology rapidly heats cells to the optimal operating range, enabling a 0 to 80% charge within 30 minutes.
The company also said the battery technology enables quick extraction of lithium ions and rapid response to charging signals, including a graphite innovation that improved the lithium-ion intercalation rate by modifying graphite surface properties to increase intercalation channels, shorten intercalation distances, and reduce resistance.
Furthermore, its electrolyte formula purportedly reduces the viscosity of the electrolyte to improve conductivity, and a thinner solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film also reduces the lithium-ion movement resistance .
“The upgraded electrolyte and the separator with a highly safe coating are used to provide a dual protection of the Shenxing battery,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “By regulating the global temperature field inside the cells using intelligent algorithms, CATL has built a real-time fault testing system that can solve the problems brought about by fast refueling, enabling a high level of safety for the Shenxing battery.”
In April, CATL unveiled a new ultra-high energy battery technology initially slated for aviation, and with an automotive cell under development. The so-called “condensed matter” battery, a type of semi-solid state product with condensed electrolyte and new anode and separator materials, will have an energy density of up to 500 Wh/kg
In the latest, “In Conversation” issue of pv magazine we talk to a range of people about their experience with solar, from a sailor and a pair of overland adventurers to a mountain climber and more besides. We also focus on Africa to consider why a continent with such vast solar resource still lags more developed economies when it comes to widespread PV and energy storage rollout.
In 2021, CATL rolled out its first generation sodium-ion battery with an energy density of 160 Wh/kg and promised an increase to 200 Wh/kg for the next generation.
In 2022, CATL unveiled Qilin battery, the third generation of its cell-to-pack technology, claiming the highest integration level to date. With a record-breaking volume utilization efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg, Qilin is reportedly capable of delivering a range of over 1,000 km and equating to a five-minute hot start and ten minutes of charging to get from 10-80% state of charge.
The Chinese battery manufacturer produced 37% of the world’s electric-vehicle batteries and 43.4% of energy storage batteries in 2022 for a grand total of 289 GWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/22/new-research-shows-renewables-are-more-profitable-than-nuclear-power/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE,FRANCE",MARIE BEYER,"AUGUST 22, 2023",New research shows renewables are more profitable than nuclear power,"From pv magazine France
A group of researchers from the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), the Stockholm School of Economics (SSE), and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) have published new research questioning recent efforts to increase investments in nuclear power, especially in the European Union and the United States – a political choice justified by the desire to decarbonize economies as quickly as possible.
However, the researchers show that in terms of cost and speed, renewable energy sources have already beaten nuclear and that each investment in new nuclear plants delays decarbonization compared to investments in renewable energies. “In a decarbonizing world, delays increase CO2 emissions,” the researchers pointed out.
The researchers considered all planned nuclear capacities and said the increase in costs from the original project proposals is significant.
For example, they found that the delayed Flammanville project in France saw its budget increase from €3.3 billion ($3.6 billion) to €13.2 billion, noting that these figures don't even include the financing costs, which the French Court of Auditors estimated at €4.2 billion against an initial €1.2 billion.
Another example comes from Finland, where the Olkiluoto plant, which was originally planned to cost €3 billion, ended up costing around €11 billion. And this is nothing new. Already in 2014, a study on the comparative costs of electricity infrastructure found that 97% of the 180 nuclear reactor investment projects analyzed experienced cost overruns, with an average cost increase of 117% per project.
“Historically high default risk translates into higher interest rates,” the scientists emphasized. “These two factors make the profitability of nuclear projects highly dependent on financing conditions.”
In France, the national network operator RTE estimates that an electricity system including nuclear will be slightly cheaper than a system based solely on renewable energies in 2050, it is however necessary to take into account its optimism on the projections of investment. “In its calculations, RTE assumes that the investment costs for new nuclear power plants are less than two-thirds of the estimated costs of European pressurized reactor (EPR) power plants in Finland and France,” explained the researchers. “This optimism about cost reduction does not reflect the evolution of the costs of old nuclear reactors in many countries.”
According to the researchers, given the latest EPR projects and investment trends, nuclear costs will tend to increase over the next few years.
“Despite its low profitability, nuclear energy is presented as a good investment to fight against climate change. However, today, the competition for the profitability of nuclear does not come from coal or gas, but from renewable energies,” the scientists stated.
The study also questions the reliability of the nuclear fleet, particularly given the dramatically low availability of French power plants this year – nearly half of the 56 nuclear reactors were closed even though the EU was in a complicated period of electricity supply with frequent peaks in the price of electricity above €3/kWh.
The availability of this electrical source is also questioned in view of the increasingly frequent droughts expected in the coming years, causing, in particular, low river flows and therefore associated problems of cooling power plants.
“Flexibility rather than baseload generation is needed to balance a renewable energy-based power system,” the research team highlighted. “However, the ramp-up of a nuclear power plant is slow and the composition of the cost of nuclear energy does not correspond to the role of a backup technology for electrical systems with high shares of wind and solar energy.”
On a large scale, both renewables and nuclear power will have low electricity prices for much of the year, but very high prices for hundreds of hours, resulting in uncertain and highly variable revenues. According to the researchers, the backup technology in a sustainable energy mix should be a low-capital-cost, high-variable-cost power generation technology, the opposite of a nuclear power plant, which has very high upfront costs. They instead suggest the integration of storage in the form of hydrogen, using batteries or pumped hydroelectricity, based in particular on the Bloomberg analysis, which reports a price of battery storage down from $1,220 to $132 per kWh between 2010 and 2021.
“Given enough time, it may be possible to build a nuclear power plant to the highest safety standards and remain economically relevant, even taking into account the costs of storing nuclear waste for thousands of years,” the scientists concluded. “However, building nuclear power plants requires many years of planning and construction and is expensive, while the climate crisis demands urgency and requires such large investments that profitability is paramount.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/22/saudi-researchers-apply-distributionally-robust-optimization-to-wind-solar-project-siting/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,MIDDLE EAST,SAUDI ARABIA",LIOR KAHANA,"AUGUST 22, 2023","Saudi researchers apply distributionally robust optimization to wind, solar project siting","A group of scientists from the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia has developed a new method for wind and PV project siting that they said provides a “more realistic” modeling of uncertain parameters compared to conventional stochastic approaches.
The new model uses deep learning features for solar radiation forecast and is reportedly able to identify locations with maximal power output and minimal power production variance. Its novelty consists of utilizing distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to account for uncertainties in forecasting solar radiation and wind speed.
DRO generally considers only partial distributional information to evaluate the optimal solution and takes the worst-case over a family of probability distributions of uncertain variables. “The DRO chance constraint optimization model is a less conservative solution than the robust model for representing the forecast uncertainties of the wind turbines and PV system production,” the academics explained.
Furthermore, the model relies on a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a simplified version of the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, which is a kind of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems.
The LSTM technique takes the relevant parts of a pre-trained machine learning model and applies them to a new but similar problem. The GRU performs the same operations but with fewer steps and learns the dependencies between time steps in time series and sequence data.
The scientists applied their new methodology to PV and wind project siting in Saudi Arabia and found it is a “less conservative” approach in forecasting uncertainties than multi-objective robust optimization models.
They investigated 28 potential locations and considered historical weather data collected between 2010 and 2020. “It consists of snapshots that are taken every ten minutes,” they explained. “Each snapshot consists of the following date entries; temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, snowfall, snow depth, short-wave irradiation, and wind speed at 100 m.”
According to the researchers, the result of the test showed that the DRO model forecast trend is closer to the actual recorded data, compared to those recorded by an older and simpler robust optimization model.
“Our approach results in more realistic modeling of the uncertain variables than the deterministic or robust models,” the paper notes. “The results also demonstrated that candidate sites with low wind speeds or candidate sites that are close to each other are highly not recommended in accordance with the map of mean wind speed and the map of global horizontal solar irradiation of Saudi Arabia.”
The novel methodology was presented in the paper “Multi-objective distributionally robust approach for optimal location of renewable energy sources,” published in the Alexandria Engineering Journal.

Sydney-listed Energy One has been targeted in a cyberattack, with the company confirming that “certain corporate systems in Australia and the United Kingdom” were affected.
Energy One, which specializes in energy trading software, said in a statement that it “took immediate steps to limit the impact of the incident,” including disabling “some links between its corporate and customer-facing systems.” It said that it has alerted the Australian Cyber Security Centre and UK authorities of the breach. It noted that “analysis is underway to identify which, if any, additional systems may have been affected by the cyberattack.”
The attack comes after the government-backed Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre (CSCRC) raised concerns that Australia’s use of foreign-made solar panel technology, notably inverters, has made the country susceptible to targeted cyberattacks that could undermine the stability of power grids. In a new report, the CSCRC said that the cyber risks associated with solar inverters has increased as the popularity of smart home energy systems has boomed, with most inverters now web connected for monitoring and control purposes.
The CSCRC said that as the number of homes with solar systems continues to increase, the risk associated with inverters continues to grow with the devices vulnerable to a range of cyber intrusions including “hacking, malware attacks, manipulation and disruption.”
“As internet-connected devices they collect and distribute valuable data and are attractive targets for malicious cyber actors,” the research body said. “In the case of photovoltaic inverters, which play an increasingly vital role in Australia’s power supply, the potential ramifications could be catastrophic.”
While individual attacks wouldn’t affect the grid more broadly, CSCRC Research Director Helge Janicke said a widespread attack could destabilize an entire power grid, leading to widespread blackouts.
“Conceivably such attacks could be so severe that they result in a ‘black start’ event, an effective restarting of a power grid,” she said. “It could take a week to recover from a black start because power plants would be incapable of turning back without reliance on an auxiliary power source.”
The CSCRC has recommended a raft of policy solutions, saying Australia needs to take a more hands-on approach to regulation of cyber security, especially as it relates to the security of critical infrastructure.
The CSCRC said is calling for cyber security impact assessments for all solar inverters sold in Australia and the introduction of mandatory cyber security ratings for solar inverters. It also declared that any inverters assessed as having serious cyber security vulnerabilities should be removed from sale and recalled from use, or appropriate security fixes should be applied if available.
“There is an opportunity to embed cyber security considerations into mandatory standards that solar inverters sold in Australia should be required to meet,” it said.

The series consists of the Compress 5800i AW and Compress 6800i AW heat pumps, which both use propane (R290) as the refrigerant. “The use of R290 requires to implement additional components in regards to safety, due to refrigerant flammability, which are not needed in case of F-Gas refrigerant,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “On the other hand, the R290 refrigerant is not affected by F-Gas regulation and therefore more affordable.”
The manufacturer is offering the new heat pumps with supplementing PV packages. “Especially in the DACH markets heat pump sales are increasingly combined with PV systems,” the spokesperson went on to say. “Bosch Home Comfort is also offering a power meter/sensor enabling the Bosch heat pumps to work with any existing PV system and battery storage solution at home.”
The Compress 5800i AW heat pump is available in five versions with a rated power of 3.9 kW to 6-7 kW and has a maximum flow temperature of 60 C. It also features an integrated 180 L domestic hot water storage tank and a 16 L buffer storage tank.
Furthermore, this product has  3-way switching valve for the generation of domestic hot water, and a footprint of 0.36 m², which the company said makes it ideal for use in new buildings. The wall-mounted version has a height of 71 cm.
The Compress 6800i AW heat pump is also sold in five versions with a rated power of 3.9 kW to 6.7 kW and has a maximum flow temperature of 75 C. It features two heating circuits and an integrated 70 L buffer storage tank concept with a height of 1.2 m, which the company said is ideal for refurbished and new buildings.
Both products measure 600 mm x 600 mm x 1,787 mm and have a weight of 156 kg. They are sound-optimized from the ground up thanks to integrated sound diffusers. The manufacturer claims the new products are among the quietest heat pumps in their class.
“The Compress 5800i AW and Compress 6800i AW are compatible with energy management ready from Q4 2023 onwards,” the spokesperson explained. “The energy management itself must be purchased separately via a one-time license fee that optimizes your energy system and results in saved extra energy costs year by year.”
Bosch Home Comfort is currently selling the new heat pumps in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Luxemburg. “In September we will offer the heat pump in France, Netherlands, Denmark, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Poland,” the spokesperson said. “In November, we will also bring them to Italy and next year we will launch them in further European markets.”
