The 220 MW/440 MWh system uses LFP batteries from Xiamen-based energy storage developer Hithium. It will store energy generated by solar and wind, according to a company statement.
The storage system will provide grid stability services by controlling frequency and peak demand. “When the grid experiences high demand, the stored energy can be directed towards homes and businesses,” Hithium said in a statement. “The project will help ensure the stability of the electricity network, enabling greater volumes of renewable energy projects to be connected to the grid, as China continues to decarbonize,” it added.
Hithium recently presented a 300 Ah battery for rooftop PV applications. It plans to invest $4.71 billion in the expansion of its manufacturing capacity to 135 GWh by the end of 2025. It also made a commitment this month to as many as eight storage projects in Australia alongside local solar developer Sun Valley HK Group.

The team surveyed 80 professionals from 10 professional groups involved in BIPV, including architects, engineers, researchers, PV installers, and property developers, across the globe.
The survey identified methods, approaches, and workflows in BIPV design and analysis under four key areas: solar irradiation, BIPV power output, building performance, and financial and design outcome.
It found that “there’s a lack of awareness among the respondents on the methods and models used to estimate [plane of array], power output, embodied emissions, heat island impact, thermal, daylighting, structural and fire requirements of BIPV projects,” the authors wrote.
With respect to shading, the survey revealed that more than 25% of respondents are unsure of what’s the most suitable method for estimating shading in BIPV projects. The ray-tracking approach was chosen by the largest cohort of professionals, followed by the shading percentage method, and then the far-field shading horizon map tool.
“To do that work right, we need better building design tools,” Rebecca Yang, associate professor at RMIT University in Australia and co-author of the report told pv magazine. Existing building design tools currently use suboptimal shading estimation methods, Yang explained.
First, these tools often lack many PV products in their database, resulting in calculations using inaccurate parameters. Second, the shading estimates are usually done for large surfaces of the building and over a short time interval, rather than at the individual panel level over a long time period. The reason, according to Yang, is that the latter calculations would be very time-consuming and take a large amount of computing power.
BIPV professionals may also lack the technical knowledge to work with the existing tools, according to Yang. Information on how to use these tools is also often not readily available. “A lot of firms don’t use complex building design software, which makes the simulation very conceptual and high level, and cannot provide very detailed simulations,” she said.
The IEA-PVPS report concluded that research and development into the most suitable methods for BIPV shading estimation, among many others, is required to improve its uptake. “Due to the cross-functional nature of BIPV as a building material and an electro-technical device, there’s a need to improve the knowledge and awareness of both the [architecture, engineering, and construction] industry and BIPV industry professionals on the BIPV design and analysis methods and workflow,” the authors said.

The scheme was introduced in January 2021, after the region’s net metering scheme ended, and it currently offers a premium of up to €1,500. For solar panels commissioned in 2023, the premium will be reduced to a maximum of €750. The contribution will be €150/kWh for the first 4 kWp and €75/kWh from 4 kWp to 6 kWp systems.
“We have no problems with [the measure]. It was announced clearly that it was going to happen, and we fully understand that the premium is no longer needed simply due to the high electricity prices,” Dirk Van Evercooren, managing director of Flemish renewable energy association Organisatie voor Duurzame Energie (ODE) Vlaanderen, told pv magazine.
The measure will also impact those who placed their panel orders in 2022 but only have them installed and inspected in 2023. Flemish Energy Minister Zuhal Demir justified sticking with Dec. 31, 2022, rather than the order date as the cut-off point over fraud concerns, which allegedly took place when the region issued green energy certificates. The premium is scheduled to end altogether in Jan. 1, 2025.
The Flemish government also offers a home battery premium, currently providing €225 for batteries up to 4 kWh, €187.5 for 4 kWh to 6 kWh, and €150 for 6 kWh to 9 kWh. It originally announced it would end this premium on July 1, 2023, but it has now brought the end date to April 1, 2023. For battery systems from 6 kWh to 9 kWh, it will end already on Jan. 1, 2023.  That decision was not welcomed by the ODE.
“We do not approve of this [decision]. If there is a path that is announced and suddenly [the premium is reduced and ended] quicker than announced, this causes problems for the sector because sales have already been signed,” said Van Evercooren. From January to April 2023, the premium will be reduced to €150 and €125 for batteries up to 4 kWh and between 4 kWh and 6 kWh, respectively.
Given the premium’s low value, the government’s unexpected decision is nevertheless unlikely to considerably affect Flanders’ home storage market, according to Van Evercooren. Home batteries’ peak shaving services are also expected to become more important in the region in 2023.
“We also see that the [home storage] business proposition for installers has changed. On Jan. 1, 2023, there will be a new capacity-based grid tariff introduced in Flanders. Now the battery systems are not being sold as a complement to the PV installation, but rather [as a way] to lower your grid fee. Batteries will help reduce the peak demand from the grid, which is exactly what this capacity-based tariff is looking at,” Van Evercooren explained.
The premium for heat pump boilers, on the other hand, will be retroactively increased from €450 to €900 for the period between July 1, 2022, and Dec. 31, 2025. It will remain capped at 40% of eligible investment costs for the purchase and installation of the devices, excluding VAT.
“I think heat pumps are one of the future-proofed technologies, and they are now getting the attention they deserve,” Van Evercooren concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/12/21/3d-electronics-printer-has-potential-to-reshape-solar-and-storage/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"DECEMBER 21, 2022",3D electronics printer has potential to reshape solar and storage,"From pv magazine Australia 
Australian National University (ANU) spinoff Syenta has just completed a $2.46 million seed funding raise to help deliver its 3D electronics printers to early customers. After working on the technology for the last three years, co-founder and CEO Jekaterina Viktorova tells pv magazine Australia the startup will shortly be seeking feedback on its initial printer, which can be used to build electronic prototypes.
“We call it a printer for electronics but really its a multi-material additive manufacturing technology. You can literally make anything you want,” says Ben Wilkinson, Syenta's head of research and development.
Syenta prints with electrochemistry, using a purely additive method. “We basically use electricity to deposit patterns of material,” Wilkinson explains.
Syenta prints with electrochemistry, using a purely additive method. This approach holds potential to reshape manufacturing costs due to simplicity, but also because the printer uses what are essentially precursor materials. That is, if someone wants to print with copper, the “ink” would actually be a copper ink. “Our method turns the raw material into copper as we’re printing it,” Wilkinson says.
“The other really exciting thing is that our process can work in reverse. So we [can]  turn the [for instance] copper back into copper salt, and that just becomes new ink that we can reuse,” he adds. “It’s getting much closer to how biology does it – where every resource can be reused again and it’s fully circular.”
For CEO Viktorova that's the beauty of electrochemistry, “It’s reversible and it’s highly efficient compared to other methods.”
The approach strips away many of the process layers associated with traditional manufacturing, thereby reducing the amount of both energy and materials that go into producing electronics. It also liberates technologies from their supply chains, which in the renewables industry is looking increasingly valuable.
The other side of the proposition is what the additive manufacturing can offer to industries like photovoltaics, PCB, antennae, sensor and others. “For instance, we can make much more sophisticated designs faster and have complex geometries which improve performance of solar cells as well as reducing cost,” Wilkinson says.
“The geometry of those two technologies [solar and batteries] very strongly determines the performance. So how far physically do ions in batteries have to move to charge or discharge? Or, in solar cells, what is the resistance of electrons moving through the solar cell? If we can make that really, really small, on a nanoscale, we can dramatically reduce that resistance or time to charge.”
Potential applications aside, Syenta’s current printer – which is focused on enabling its customers to build technology prototypes – fits on a desk. “The next step is actually releasing the product,” Viktorova says. “We’re actually actively looking for people who are willing to prototype using our tech and have this inform our future full product building activity, which will be the product that ends up on our website and shipping worldwide.”
Eventually, the company’s ambition is to target large-scale electronics manufacturing. “We think we can do better at a lot of existing manufacturing steps for electronics,” Wilkinson says.
“The potential of our technology is really high in terms of how fast it can go but at the moment the way we do it is quite slow,” he adds. “It’s focussed on prototyping but we think we can do large scale manufacturing and the process is really suited to that but there’s just a lot of engineering that has to happen to build out that capability.”
To date, the vision of scalable additive manufacturing from 3D printing remains unfulfilled.
The core of Syenta’s tech started with a late night email between Viktorova and her then PhD supervisor – now co-founder – Professor Luke Connal. The next day in the ANU lab, Viktorova started to experiment.
While several academics had tried a similar approach before, Viktorova says no one had done it in quite the same way and, perhaps more importantly, her PhD meant she could dedicate years to refining and testing to get it right.
“The timing and combination of skills was just right for us to get it to the next commercialisation step,” she adds.
Syenta, which recently changed its name from Spark3D, is now separate from ANU, though close collaboration with the university and the research continues.
To explain how the startup’s approach works, Wilkinson points to the chrome hubcaps donned by fancy cars. That plating, he says, is a form of electrodeposition. “What we do differently is we don’t have to use chrome, we can use lots of different materials and also we print in a very small area. We can do complex patterns with this kind of plating of material.”
In terms of the “additive” component, this refers to an approach of only adding materials. This is different from most manufacturing processes, which both add and subtract materials.
“I think that's a unique value proposition in itself,” Viktorova says, referring to the additive approach. “You don’t have as much literal waste.”
Syenta’s current printer prints with metals, alloys, conductive and insulating polymers and semiconductors.
The printer can do a single layer printed circuit “in minutes,” Viktorova says, “as opposed to other developed technologies spending hours doing that.”
Wilkinson points to silicon solar cells and microchips as interesting ways to think through Syenta’s approach. Silicon microchips require high resolution, as in highly complex patterns on a small space, whereas silicon solar cells require far less detailing, making them “low res,” but are manufactured across far larger areas.
“The potential of our technology is to be able to do both of those things at same time – so have the nanoscale, resolution complexity at the speed and area of solar cells,” Wilkinson says.
Viktrova adds that the technology has “quite an interesting relationship between precision of fabrication and speed – it’s quite linear, which is a very unique thing to have. That’s why we believe there is a unique scalability even in our prototyping product that is intrinsic to the technology itself.”
Viktorova describes solar as a particularly interesting market for Syenta thanks to the similarity of set up; “They just use different technology [to manufacture] – usually additive in combination with subtractive. So we’re very keen to save this extra step for someone.”
Beyond solar, the 3D printer has a huge range of other manufacturing applications. “A lot of the designs that people currently make devices in are limited by the constraints of the current manufacturing landscape, or even prototyping landscape,” Viktorova says.
“Imagine you unleash that creativity and allow people to make something they could not make before because they did not have access to the right tool.”
Making more stuff generally translates to more pollution. But Wilkinson says using the emissions scope equation, the Scope 1 emissions from the printer are nothing – at ANU at least the printer runs on renewable electricity.
In terms of Scope 2, the printer’s additive approach means no more materials are used than absolutely necessary. What is deposited is deposited well and fast and in a way that makes it recyclable, meaning each finished, printed product has the least embodied energy it can for its output, he says.
As for Scope 3, Wilkinson notes the technology gives people the ability to make better, cheaper devices that can increase the uptake of renewable technology, whether it be batteries, solar, smart devices or ways to connect to the Internet of Things (IoT). “If that’s really cheap, more people adopt it,” Wilkinson says.
The reversibility component of the technology is particularly important for the startup. “We’re building towards being able to recycle whatever we print in the same product in the same system,” Viktorova says.
In this year’s round of the global Climate Launchpad program, Syenta (then Spark3D) made the global semi-finals – the furthest any Australian startup has progressed. Its success in the competition secured Syenta a spot in the ClimateLaunchpad accelerator program, aimed at helping startups successfully commercialise into businesses.
Syenta will participate in the program in 2023.
In terms of big picture vision, the Syenta team thinks their technology holds much promise for large-scale electronics manufacturing, with Wilkinson saying he believes the “bulk” of electronics manufacturing could be done better using its method.
Europe has a rich printed electronics manufacturing ecosystem, Viktorova says, and this is is something Syenta is hoping to delve into and learn from in the near term.
“We would like to make a product that sits in existing supply chains, or existing production lines that would be faster and cheaper and has this resolution patterning benefit,” Wilkinson says. “I’m sure it will happen, but it just takes time and effort to get that done.”
It will also require a fair amount of resources and financing, something not lost on the team. Building on the recent seed capital raising, Viktorova says the company will look to fundraise for the next commercialization stages in the coming years.

Germany’s Federal Network Agency allocated 104 MW of solar for buildings and noise barriers on motorways out of the tendered 202 MW in its latest auction. Despite going partially unsubscribed, the tendered volume had already been significantly reduced in advance compared to the 767 MW auctioned in previous rounds.
The volume-weighted average award value fell slightly compared to the previous round. According to the authority, it was €0.0874/kWh, compared with prices between €0.0809/kWh and €0.0891/kWh in December 2021.
The auction also included an innovation tender for 400 MW. That too went unsubscribed, receiving only one bid from a combined PV and storage power plant in the Bavarian district of Kelheim. However, that is all the information that was made available. “Only one bid was accepted. Publishing the values would reveal the bidder's trade and business secrets,” says the authority’s website.
The deadline for the next tender for solar rooftop systems is Feb. 1, 2023, with a planned volume of 217 MW. For ground-mounted systems, the date is March 1, 2023, for a planned volume of 1,950 MW. The actual tender volume has, however, not yet been published. The planned volumes could still be adjusted by the Federal Network Agency, as could the applicable maximum value.
The current print edition of pv magazine visits Ukraine to examine the extent of damage caused to the nation’s energy infrastructure, including its solar plants, and includes coverage of how PV has been affected in the newly-liberated region of Kherson.

Origis Energy announced it contracted Mitsubishi Power Americas to supply batteries for the development of three battery energy storage systems in the southeast US. The projects total 150 MW/600 MWh of capacity and will be co-located at solar facilities.
The projects will include Mitsubishi Power Emerald batteries and are planned to come online over the next two years. They will use Mitsubishi’s energy management system and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to control charge and discharge cycles, monitor the system’s status, send alarms and alerts, and enable long-term data storage. The company has more than 2.5 GWh of utility-scale battery energy storage projects in various stages of deployment globally.
“The Emerald storage solution technology we’re delivering for Origis follows rigorous NERC CIP and IEC 62443 Security Development Lifecycle Process policy and processes aligned to industry best practices,” said Alejandro Schnakofsky, vice president of global strategy, energy storage solutions, Mitsubishi Power Americas. “It is imperative in everything we do to protect energy systems and operators with the strongest level of cybersecurity possible,” he added.
The grid-scale energy storage projects offer services like arbitrage, energy market participation, transmission and distribution deferral services, renewable capacity support, curtailment avoidance, grid frequency regulation, and voltage support.
Origis has over 1.5 GW of operational and contracted projects in the US southeast, and over 4 GW across the country.

The academics removed the solvent dimethyl-sulfoxide from the commonly used dimethyl-formamide/dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMF/DMSO) solvent preparation method. They introduced dimethylammonium chloride (DMACI) as a crystallization agent instead, creating a fabrication method they called DMF/DMACI.
They claim that this allowed them to more effectively control the intermediate phases of the perovskite crystallization process, including texturing, orientation, and the crystallinity of the perovskite.
“By utilizing DMACl as a crystallization agent, we can gradually transition via the hexagonal face-sharing perovskite polytypes (2H, 4H, 6H) toward a 3C corner-sharing perovskite, resulting in highly crystalline and textured thin films with a face-up perovskite unit cell orientation,” the scientists explained.
They subjected 138 sample devices to accelerated aging and testing processes at high temperatures. The formamidinium-caesium perovskite solar cells created with the DMF/DMACI process reportedly outperformed the control group and demonstrated resistance to thermal conditions, humidity, and light degradation.
The best device operated above the T80 threshold for over 1,400 hours under simulated sunlight at 65 C, where T80 is the time it takes for a solar cell to reduce to 80% of its initial efficiency. Beyond 1,600 hours, the control device fabricated using the conventional DMF/DMSO method stopped functioning, while devices fabricated with the DMF/DMACI design retained 70% of their original efficiency, under accelerated aging conditions.
The scientists performed the same degradation study on a group of devices at 85 C, with the new cells again outperforming the control group. They determined that the new cells age by a factor of 1.7 for each 10 C increase in temperature, which is close to the twofold increase expected with commercial silicon devices.
“I think what separates us from other studies is that we've done a lot of accelerated aging. We've aged the cells at 65 C and 85 C under the whole light spectrum,” said David McMeekin, a scientist at Oxford University.
Using 138 prototypes in the study is also significant, according to McMeekin.
“Most studies only show one curve without any standard deviation or any kind of statistical approach to determine if this design is more stable than the other,” he said.
The researchers said they expect additional improvements by gaining a better understanding of the intermediate phases of perovskite crystallization “and the mechanism by which they impact the crystallization kinetics and grain orientation of perovskite films.” They described their findings in “Intermediate-phase engineering via dimethylammonium cation additive for stable perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Nature Materials.

The energy ministers of the European Union reached an agreement earlier this week to limit the price of gas imports from Russia to €180/MWh – the same value as the price cap on renewables. The cap will apply to transactions linked to the Dutch TTF index.
The measure, which stems from what is known as the “Iberian exception,” was supported by Germany, with the Netherlands and Austria abstaining, and Hungary voting against it. It is expected to go into force on Feb. 15, 2023.
The mechanism will be activated when the gas price exceeds €180/MWh for three consecutive days. A price limit will then go into effect, but it will be automatically deactivated when global prices dip below €145/MWh for three consecutive days.
Similarly, the cap could be suspended due to emergencies in the natural gas sector, instability in financial markets, declines in LNG arrivals to the European Union that affect the security of supplies, or significant jumps in gas demand.

Researchers from Empa have developed a new low-temperature production process that produces CIGS bifacial thin-film solar cells with efficiency yields of 19.8% for front lighting and 10.9% for rear lighting.
“It is very difficult to obtain good energy conversion efficiency for solar cells with transparent conductive contacts at the front and at the back,” said Ayodhya Tiwari, the leader of Empa’s thin-film PV lab.
High-efficiency CIGS solar cells are generally produced by a high-temperature deposition process. At temperatures above 550 C, a chemical reaction occurs, resulting in a gallium oxide interface layer that blocks the current flow generated by sunlight. This reduces the energy conversion efficiency of the cell.
The Empa team developed a new low-temperature deposition process that produces far less gallium oxide, paving the way for higher cell efficiencies. They used a tiny amount of silver to lower the melting point of the CIGS alloy and achieve absorber layers with good electronic properties at a deposition temperature of only 350 C. They analyzed the multi-layered structure using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and did not detect any gallium oxide at the interface.
The cell achieved efficiency values of 19.8% for front illumination and 10.9% for rear illumination. The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) independently certified the values by using the same cell on a glass substrate, according to Empa.
The team also succeeded in fabricating a bifacial CIGS solar cell on a flexible polymer substrate. The scientists said they hope this will widen the spectrum of potential applications for such cells, given the lightness and flexibility of the materials.
The researchers also produced a bifacial GICS-perovskite tandem cell. They published their findings in “Efficiency boost of bifacial Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin-film solar cells for flexible and tandem applications with silver-assisted low-temperature process,” which was recently published in Nature Energy.
“Bifacial CIGS technology has the potential to produce energy conversion efficiencies greater than 33%, opening up new possibilities for thin-film solar cells in the future,” said Tiwari.
He is now trying to set up collaborative relationships with key laboratories and companies throughout Europe to accelerate the development of the technology and its industrial production on a larger scale.

The 8.2 kWh, 256 V battery uses LiFePO4 as the cathode material and has a round-trip efficiency of 95%. Up to six modules can be combined to accommodate up to 49 kWh of energy storage. Each battery module measures 579 mm × 228 mm × 795 mm and weighs 81 kg.
The inverters come in 7.6 kW or 9.6 kW versions and can be AC or DC coupled. They measure 414 mm x 790 mm x 175 mm and weigh 32 kg. They have an efficiency of 97.6%.
The system has a maximum PV input voltage of 600 V. It has an operating voltage range of 80 V to 550 V. It comes with a 10-year warranty backed by insurer Munich Re and can purportedly operate for more than 10,000 cycles. It operates in temperatures ranging from -35 C to 60 C.
The modular Alpha-ESS is compatible with new-build solar installations and retrofits to existing solar projects, according to Emporia.
“The Emporia system identifies when excess solar power is being generated, and users can configure their system to automatically turn on loads,” the company said. “Conversely, it can also be connected to draw from the grid to pre-charge ahead of when utility rates may be surging or there’s an interruption to the power supply due to weather or ongoing grid stress.”
The system is currently available in select US states.
