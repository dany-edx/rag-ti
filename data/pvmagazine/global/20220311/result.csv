Spain-based Sener has launched the Oruga software, a new tool for solar power plant design on terrains with complex orography.
“Oruga is the most advanced tool on the market for designing the most profitable photovoltaic plant on a given piece of land,” said Arturo Basurto, innovation manager at Sener. “It is capable of accurately calculating both the power production and the cost of the thousands of possible installations within a plot, selecting the most profitable configuration or providing the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE), thanks to two advanced algorithms for optimization of civil works and 3D backtracking.”
According to Sener, the Oruga software has two differentiating characteristics: the ability to accurately calculate groundworks, associated with each of the possible implementations within the plot; and the 3D backtracking algorithm allows the trackers to be positioned at the optimal angle to maximize electricity production, minimizing shadows between panels throughout the day.
In addition, the software is said to be able to analyze different combinations of panels, trackers or tables, inverters and batteries, as well as construction costs, depending on the market situation at any given time and customer preferences.
Moreover, the new tool is equipped with a catalog of components and their associated prices updated to the market. It offers, through a graphic interface, the possibility of migrating to a building information model (BIM) environment for 7D control of the project, which represents the state of the art in the digitization of energy asset management, the company said.
Ainhoa Arribas, software developer and civil engineer at Sener, explained that even with an increase in profitability of only 1% the investment in the software would be fully repaid.
Oruga is entirely developed by the company's digital solutions team and has received funding from the Basque government through the Hazitek 2020 business R&D support program.

The ministry said it will promote a series of new policies and standards for building designing and construction.
Wafer manufacturer Shangji Automation has secured a long-term wafer supply agreement from cell maker Aiko Solar. Under the terms of the agreement, Aiko will buy a total of 552 million wafers from Shangji during the 2022-2024 period. Based on current wafer prices, the contract value is estimated at around RMB3.6 billion ($568.3 million). The price will be negotiated on a monthly basis.
China's second-largest wafer maker, Zhonghuan Semiconductor, reported record revenue of RMB41 billion for fiscal year 2021 and with a YoY increase of 115%. Net profit grew 305% year-on-year to RMB3.86 billion. According to Zhonghuan, the company experienced great challenges due to the cost rise of upstream material, namely polysilicon, in 2021. However, the company maintained the business chain with both customers and suppliers with long-term contracts.
Footwear and materials science company Golden Solar has said just two months of income from its nascent mono cast wafer and heterojunction cell and module business may have pushed its operations into a profit for shareholders last year of around HK$15 million (US$1.92 million). The business yesterday reported unaudited sales of HK$377 million (US$48.2 million), up 180% from HK$125 million (US$16 million) in 2020, for expected gross profits of HK$106 million (US$13.6 million), up from HK$20.2 million (US$2.58 million). The new solar entrant said its PV business brought income chiefly in November and December, despite electricity rationing by the authorities. In an update to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Golden Solar said: “The group expects that the new business will become the main business of the group and would become the driving force of higher profit growth for the near future.” The manufacturer also said it benefited from less Covid-related business disruption in China as footwear customers turned to its original equipment manufacturing business from their usual Southeast Asian and Indian suppliers.
Module manufacturer Solargiga has said it expects profits attributable to shareholders of RMB157-207 million (US$24.8-32.8 million) from last year. The company had posted a loss of RMB216 million (US$34.2 million) in 2020 as it exited the cell manufacturing segment and yesterday said the turnaround was down to increased production capacity in its remaining, non-cell solar production operations plus related economies of scale and rising selling prices for silicon wafers in particular.
GCL-Poly appears to have backtracked on its plan to rename the business GCL Technology. The polysilicon maker and solar project developer on Wednesday told the Hong Kong Stock Exchange the extraordinary general meeting planned in Hong Kong on Thursday, to approve the company name change, would now be held in GCL premises in China on April 1, due to Covid restrictions in the special administrative region. GCL made no mention of the proposed name change it had suggested to shareholders last month and instead said the rearranged EGM in Jiangsu would consider a new share options scheme for staff. That news came a day after GCL had announced an offer to buy back up to US$53.4 million worth of an outstanding US$497 million of three-year, 10% senior notes issued by the company in June. An announcement to the Singapore Stock Exchange outlined the offer, which would pay investors $0.975 plus accrued interest for each dollar’s worth of the senior notes held, with the offer due to close on Tuesday.
Fellow poly manufacturer Daqo New Energy on Wednesday told the Shanghai Stock Exchange it expects its Xinjiang Daqo subsidiary will sell 37,000-38,000 tons of polysilicon in the first three months of this year, up 72-77% on the 21,471 tons it shifted in January-to-March last year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/11/the-mobility-revolution-swappable-lithium-ceramic-solid-state-battery-for-two-wheelers/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,HIGHLIGHTS,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"MARCH 11, 2022",The mobility rEVolution: Swappable lithium ceramic solid-state battery for two-wheelers,"While the technology remains relatively unproven, many legacy automakers have invested heavily in solid-state devices, including Toyota and Volkswagen. Meanwhile, in Taiwan, electric scooter maker Gogoro has unveiled a prototype lithium ceramic solid-state battery for two-wheel battery swapping. The prototype was jointly developed with Taiwanese solid-state battery specialist ProLogium, which has recently teamed up with German luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz to codevelop a range of passenger vehicles powered by this type of batteries. Touted as the world's first of its kind, Gogoro's solid-state batteries have an estimated capacity of 2.5kWh, far exceeding current exchange batteries with lithium-ion technology and liquid electrolyte, which currently stand at 1.7kWh. The prototype announcement is particularly important for the market in Taiwan, where Gogoro Battery Swapping is powering 95% of all electric two-wheelers. Gogoro's new prototype can be integrated with the manufacturer's existing vehicles and battery swap network, which comprises over 10,000 battery swapping stations at over 2,300 locations servicing more than 450,000 riders. According to the manufacturer, the number of its swapping stations nearly equals the one of petrol pumps in the country, and is likely to exceed it in near future.
A study led by the US Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) has tackled a long-held assumption that adding some liquid electrolyte to solid-state batteries would make them unsafe. Instead, the research team found that in many cases a small amount of liquid electrolyte did not compromise the safety of solid-state batteries and could in turn fix one of the chemistry's main problems — the solid electrolyte interface. Namely, adding a bit of liquid electrolyte could greatly increase performance while only having a negligible impact on safety, and thus help bridge the gap to commercialization in the EV and energy storage industries. It is often claimed that solid-state batteries are safer than lithium-ion ones, and the SNL researches have found this to be true under external heating failure scenario. However, as they probed the upper bounds of heat release and temperature rise across several cell-level failure scenarios and battery configurations, the researchers also found that Li-metal anode solid-state batteries are not necessarily safer under short-circuit failure scenarios or if the solid electrolyte integrity is compromised. What is more, in configurations involving Li-metal anodes, solid-state batteries were found to experience higher temperature rises than LIBs because the same amount of heat is generated over a smaller mass and volume.
Another rechargeable battery concept this time for EVs comes from US-based lithium-metal battery specialist Sion Power. Earlier this week, the company announced it had reached a development milestone with its Licerion EV battery technology demonstrating more than 2500 cycles to 70% of initial capacity. The results were achieved by a multilayer R&D pouch cell, charged in 180 minutes (C/3 rate), and completely discharged (100% depth of discharge) in 45 minutes (4C/3 rate). Sion Power describes Licerion as a hybrid between today’s lithium-ion and tomorrow’s solid-state batteries. Its technology utilizes several levels of lithium protection and can be paired with common cathode materials, including LFP and NMC. The current version of Sion Power’s 6 Ah large-format Licerion EV cell has exceeded 800 cycles as validated by an independent test laboratory under the identical conditions of C/3, 4C/3. The same 6 Ah cell can also be fast-charged to 80% capacity in less than 15 minutes. The Licerion-EV, 17 Ah cell has been independently verified with an actual (not projected) specific energy of 400 Wh/kg and energy density of 780 Wh/L.
Meanwhile in California, General Motors (GM) and Pacific Gas & Electric (PGE) are readying to test the use of EVs as on-demand power source for homes. Their pilot aims to demonstrate how EVs can serve as a backup power option at home and more broadly as a resource for the grid, leveraging the capabilities of vehicle-to-home (V2H) bidirectional charging. The pilot will involve collaborating on both the bidirectional hardware and the software-defined communication protocols that will enable power to flow from a charged EV into a customer’s home, automatically coordinating between the EV, home and PG&E’s electric supply. Multiple GM EVs will be included in the pilot, although the auto giant did not specify which. The companies aim to test the technology by this summer, and open larger customer trials by year's end.
With its roadmap to full electrification still in the works, British luxury car maker Aston Martin has teamed up with EV battery start-up Britishvolt on development of  battery cell technology for high-end performance cars. Aston Martin plans to launch its first battery EV in 2025 and to provide an electrified powertrain option to all new product lines by 2026, with a target of displaying a fully electrified core portfolio by 2030. Under the new collaboration, a joint research and development team from Aston Martin and Britishvolt will design, develop, and industrialize battery packs, including bespoke modules and a battery management system. The two organizations will work together to maximize the capability of special cylindrical high performance cells being developed by Britishvolt, which is currently working on its 45GWh manufacturing site in Cambois, Northumberland, which is expected to be fully operational in 2027. In January, Britishvolt secured $2.3 billion in UK government funding for the project, with the goal to establish mass production of batteries with high nickel content and more energy dense materials.
Another battery cell partnership was announced this week between Indian lead-acid battery major Exide Industries and China-headquartered EV battery maker SVOLT. Under the the agreement, SVOLT will grant Exide an irrevocable right, license to use, exploit and commercialize necessary tech and know-how owned by them for Li-ion cell manufacturing in India. Additionally, SVOLT will provide the support required to set up a state-of-the-art greenfield manufacturing plant on a turnkey basis. Exide plans to set up a multi-gigawatt factory equipped to manufacture cells across two popular chemistries and three formats, catering to the diverse requirements of customers in India. 
Meanwhile, on a global scale, an extraordinary surge in oil prices to the highest levels in 14 years is already driving up demand for electric vehicles (EVs), but surging raw material costs, made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, are set to trigger price increases. On Wednesday, Tesla raised prices of its U.S. Model Y SUVs and Model 3 Long Range sedans by $1,000 each and some China-made Model 3 and Model Y vehicles by 10,000 yuan ($1,582.40). While price increases for the most affordable Model 3 and Model Y versions happened a dozen times last year, this time around the U.S. carmaker has only increased the price of vehicles with nickel in their batteries. The price of nickel has been sent on a wild ride by the war in Ukraine and both the London Meta Exchange the Shanghai Exchange were forced to halt trading in certain contracts related to nickel earlier this week. In a separate announcement, Tesla confirmed that deliveries of Model Y vehicles built at Giga Berlin in Germany, which received its environmental approval last week, are starting on March 22.
But there is more to the supply concerns than just the nickel price surge. The ongoing tight supplies of semiconductors and other raw materials, as well as Covid-19-induced shipping delays that have left inventories at low levels, are making it difficult for the EV industry to keep up with the bullish demand. On Friday, Rivian, the best-funded EV startup in U.S. history, said that ongoing supply chain issues mean it will have to halve its production outlook and only build about 25,000 pickups, SUVs and delivery trucks this year. The California-based automaker said losses during its initial year of electric truck production were nearly $5 billion. It reported a $4.7 billion loss and annual revenue of $55 million, coming from deliveries of just 920 of its high-end vehicles. The company has orders for about 83,000 R1 T pickups and R1 S SUVs. Amazon, an early investor, is also waiting to get 100,000 electric delivery trucks.

By using nanomaterial deposition to engineer the interface between the electrode and the water, the team created a material that combined high electrical conductivity with a high surface area covered with abundant active sites for molecular oxygen (O2) production. The material also proved to be robust, with no drop-off in performance detected after 50 hours of continuous use,” the researchers wrote on Thursday, adding that this could present an opportunity to avoid the use of electrodes made from rare and expensive metals.
Norwegian fuel cell producer Nel ASA is ready to increase its electrolyzer production capacity to meet the European Union's raised ambitions for renewable hydrogen “Our brand-new and fully automated electrolyzer manufacturing facility at Herøya is already producing at three shifts. We are reaching new production records every week and will start a site selection process for additional production capacity in Europe,” commented Nel CEO Jon André Løkke. Nel's electrolyzer plant at Herøya can reportedly provide 500 MW of capacity to the market with the possibility to expand up to 2 GW.
Kuala Lumpur-based Petronas Hydrogen (PH2SB) and Japanese petroleum company Eneos have signed a joint feasibility study agreement (JFSA) to advance the studies for commercial hydrogen production and conversion project in Kerteh, Terengganu. “Under the JFSA, both parties will pursue detailed technical and commercial feasibility studies for the production of low carbon hydrogen from Petronas' existing facilities, production of green hydrogen from a new hydro-powered electrolyzer facility, and hydrogen conversion into methylcyclohexane (MCH). The agreement is part of the long-term memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed last August for the development of a clean hydrogen supply chain between Malaysia and Japan,” Petronas wrote on Friday.
State-owned energy company Israel Electric and United Arab Emirates-based sustainable investment company Energroup inked a preliminary deal to develop blue and green hydrogen generation last week, Israel Electric confirmed to pv magazine. The two companies will jointly develop and operate green and blue hydrogen projects.
The UAE is flexing its hydrogen muscles, and not only in the Middle East. On Sunday and Monday, Austria's Federal Chancellor Karl Nehammer visited the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to reduce dependence on Russian natural gas in the medium to long term. “Green hydrogen from the United Arab Emirates could be an alternative,” the office of the chancellor wrote on Monday. During the talks, Austrian Federal Minister Elisabeth Köstinger signed a corresponding declaration of intent on the Austrian-Emirati hydrogen alliance with the UAE's minister of industry, Sultan Bin Ahmad Sultan Al Jaber. The Austrian government spoke about green hydrogen as a possible solution in the medium to long term.
On Thursday, the governors of Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Arkansas announced that their states have entered into a three-state partnership to establish a regional hub for development, production, and use of clean hydrogen as fuel and manufacturing feedstock. “These states are perfectly situated to demonstrate the entire value chain of hydrogen and uniquely situated to tackle the hard-to-decarbonize sectors like industrial, manufacturing, and transportation. The partnership builds upon existing advantages, such as an inland seaport system that runs from Oklahoma through Arkansas and down the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana, existing intermodal rail, existing pipeline infrastructure that runs from Oklahoma through Arkansas to the Gulf of Mexico, and some of the most valuable interstate freight highways in the United States,” reads a note published by the government of Louisiana.
On Tuesday, the European Commission unveiled its plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well before 2030. “The quicker we switch to renewables and hydrogen, combined with more energy efficiency, the quicker we will be truly independent and master our energy system,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen commented. The EU will focus on renewable hydrogen production and imports. Two weeks ago, the EU said that it would provide €300.5 million as part of its Clean Hydrogen Partnership to support projects that “boost renewable hydrogen production, reduce its costs, develop its storage and distribution solutions, and stimulate the use of low carbon hydrogen in hard to abate sectors, such as energy intensive industries, aviation or heavy duty transport.”
The European Investment Bank (EIB) agreed to €543 million of new financing to support business financing in Italy, corporate innovation and expansion of the Fira de Barcelona exhibition centre, alongside other clean energy investment, as part of its Strategic European Security Initiative. “Among these projects are €53 million financing for a new solar powered, large-scale green hydrogen plant in Spain that will provide a clean energy alternative for energy intensive industrial production,” the EIB announced on Thursday.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/11/italian-solar-sector-defines-standards-for-agrivoltaics/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 11, 2022",Italian solar sector defines standards for agrivoltaics,"Italian renewable energy associations ANIE Rinnovabili, Italia Solare and Elettricità Futura have released a joint position paper defining a series of standards for agrivoltaic projects.
The document identifies with extreme precision the area that is allowed to be used for power generation in the two most common agrivoltaics configurations — solar arrays with elevated solar modules and PV systems deployed between crop rows.
“The calculation of this surface is different in the two categories of agrivoltaic systems identified and is consistent with the high volume of agricultural activity guaranteed by each model,” the three trade bodies said in a statement. “In order to help identify a clear perimeter for this type of system, the paper identifies the minimum and incremental requirements that distinguish different levels of integration between the agricultural and photovoltaic sectors.”
As for the first category, the Italian association specified that these can be built with either fixed structures or solar trackers, and that the solar modules should be placed at a minimum height of 2.1m in order to ensure full agricultural activity and, at the same time, ensure the creation of a micro-climate that is colder than usual in the summer and warmer in the winter months.
The PV systems deployed between crop rows, which were defined as inter-rows systems, may also be constructed with both fixed structures and trackers and be developed with different project designs, including vertically mounted panels. “The inter-rows systems can also be designed to have multiple rows of modules in order to optimize agricultural yield,” the paper reads.
Furthermore, according to the document, a photovoltaic project combined with agriculture, in order to be compatible with the proposed standards, should comply with three main requirements: the authorization of experts such an agronomist or a zootechnician, depending on the farming activity; the adoption of a monitoring system for the agricultural yield; and limiting the area for the non-agricultural activity to up to 30% of the total project area.
The three associations added that projects relying on elevated modules should be prioritized, as their deployment allows full agricultural continuity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/11/the-solar-tech-check-pv-in-space-and-thin-films-stride-forward/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MARCH 11, 2022","The Solar Tech Check: PV in space, and thin films stride forward","In the United States, a three-year project investigating causes of voltage loss in cadmium selenide telluride thin films published its discovery of a new way to measure and track the mechanisms causing voltage loss within a device.
Working both with modules produced in the lab at Colorado State University, and by Ohio headquartered manufacturer First Solar, the group measured a characteristic called external radiative efficiency, that allowed it to better understand mechanisms behind voltage loss. “We learned that the main mechanism limiting voltage is not necessarily linked to defects within the bulk of the cell nor at the interfaces between different materials comprising the cell,” says Arthur Onno, assistant research professor at Arizona State University, who led the research. “That’s usually what is assumed in the CadTel community. But instead, it’s an issue with selectivity, which is when electrons within the cell go the wrong way and cancel each other.”
The group has published an explanation of the method and its use for a full analysis of CdTe devices in Nature Energy. With a fuller understanding of what limits the voltage, they were also able to suggest doping and other approaches to achieve higher efficiencies. The group also states that its measurement approach could also be applied to other cell materials including silicon and perovskites, and that it is already working on industrial applications. “We’re also focused on getting this technology into the hands of industry,” says Zachary Holman, an associate professor of electrical engineering in the Fulton Schools. “We have already built replicates of this measurement technique for a couple of domestic solar cell and module manufacturers.”
Ahead of a planned launch in August, NASA this week announced that it has completed the construction of the solar arrays that will power its Psyche spacecraft on a 2.4 billion kilometer mission to study a metal-rich asteroid.
“Seeing the spacecraft fully assembled for the first time is a huge accomplishment; there's a lot of pride,” said Brian Bone, who leads assembly, test, and launch operations for the mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “This is the true fun part. You're feeling it all come together. You feel the energy change and shift.”
After launch, the solar arrays will deploy, and provide all of the power for the spacecraft’s 3.5-year journey to the asteroid, located between Mars and Jupiter. The cross-shaped solar arrays measure 75 meters, and with them fully deployed the spacecraft is roughly the size of a tennis court. Near Earth, the full array’s capacity is around 21kW, but this will be reduced to just 2kW closer to the mission’s destination. “These arrays are designed to work in low-light conditions, far away from the Sun,” explained Peter Lord, Psyche technical director at Maxar Technologies where the panels were designed.
While NASA is preparing to launch a foldable solar array into space later this year, research continues into making these cells even more powerful, as well as lighter and flexible – to potentially allow an array to roll up into an even smaller space before deployment.
Working with high efficiency materials used in solar cells for space and satellite applications, scientists led by Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE simulated various cell designs, each based on a flexible triple junction layer approximately 10 microns thick. The cells were divided into three ‘generations’ and tested under “AM0” irradiation, to represent the light spectrum outside of Earth’s atmosphere, before and after being particle irradiation similar to what the cells would be exposed to in space. The cells and testing process are described in full in a paper published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
“The power-to-mass ratios of the presented solar cells of 3.0 W/g [before irradiation, or beginning of life] and 2.6 W/g [after irradiation, or end of life] are already three to four times higher compared with space solar cells on thin germanium substrates and can compete with best published values for thin-film solar cells,” the group says, further noting that its fabrication process is based on a reusable substrate, with potential for further cost reduction.
Scientists in Spain and the UK worked with silver-bismuth-disulfide (AgBiS2), to fabricate a device less than 1000 nanometers thick. Their devices achieved 8.85% efficiency certified by an accredited lab in the US, and themselves measured a top efficiency of 9.17%.
While silver is a rare and expensive material to work with, the group noted that other thin-film solar technologies rely on rare materials such as indium or tellurium, and their approach uses no toxic materials and does not require temperatures higher than 100 C, bringing potential for low-cost manufacturing.
The cells are described in full in a paper published in Nature Photonics. Key to fabricating a device so thin was a mild annealing process that allowed them to engineer particle distribution on the surface of the device, and optimize its light absorption properties. The group says it will now work on further optimizations to reach higher efficiency. “the devices reported in this study set a record among low-temperature and solution processed, environmentally friendly inorganic solar cells in terms of stability, form factor and performance,” said Gerasimos Konstantatos, professor at the Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology. “We are thrilled with the results and will continue to proceed in this line of study to exploit their intriguing properties in photovoltaics as well as other optoelectronic devices”.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/11/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-weighing-on-moldovas-pv-sector/,"COVID-19,FINANCE,GEOPOLITICS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,EASTERN EUROPE,EUROPE,MOLDOVA,UKRAINE",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"MARCH 11, 2022",Russian invasion of Ukraine weighing on Moldova’s PV sector ,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine has already had a significant impact on the region's PV sector, including in Moldova. The ongoing military clash has had negative repercussions because it has driven uncertainties for potential investors, both internationally and at the local level. The first months of this year pointed to a boom in the Moldovan PV sector, but the initial consequences of Russian aggression are already visible. 
“We are already seeing the decline. Some potential investors are taking time, while at the same time cooperation with some suppliers, partners and industries in Ukraine has stopped completely,” Vitali Zveaghintev, the founder of Zaw Energy Srl, told pv magazine. 
Ukraine, a regional powerhouse in industries such as steel production, has played a key role in the regional PV sector.
“We, in the photovoltaic sector, mostly import the metal support structures for ground mounting systems,” he said.
Zveaghintev returned to Moldova in 2018 to contribute to his country's development. His company – a distributor and a contractor – has worked with the likes of Enel Green Power on projects in Chile. It reportedly has accounted for around 50% of all new PV installations in Moldova over the past three years.
Moldova's current law for PV development features three support schemes. A net-metering program has been in place since the law went into force in March 2018. The nation also has the feed-in-tariff for installations up to 1MW, and then power purchase agreements (PPAs) for installations above 1MW in size.
“With regard to the feed-in-tariff, there has been an attempt to divide up the quotas that the government allocated in 2020. It was 15MW for solar, a derisory share. In two years, only 30% to 40% of those projects were implemented. Political instability and a lack of interest in allocating new quotas for the renewables sector slowed everything down,” explained Zveaghintev.
PAS, a pro-EU political party, won an absolute majority in the 2021 elections on a platform promoting change. Its rise has triggered new, unprecedented interest. 
“In the autumn, the new pro-European government started implementing the strategies that Moldova had already defined when it made commitments with the European Union and the European Energy Community. In December, the government allocated many more allowances for renewables – hundreds of megawatts for PV, wind and biomass,” said Zveaghintev.
The feed-in-tariff procedure is set to start at the beginning of April. Auctions for PPAs are expected to begin by the end of the year.
“The ministry is working on secondary legislation to create the commissions and rules to organize the procedures. The year was off to a very good start, especially with the rise in gas prices,” he said. “This increased the interest of the private sector, individuals but also small and medium-sized industries. Many planned investments in renewables. Everything was going well until a fortnight ago. Now everything is on stand-by because priorities have changed.” 
Despite other priorities, government sources have told pv magazine that they remain firmly committed to renewables, despite the current difficulties.
“We are planning to review the renewables law this law. So far, we have already allocated 200MW capacity for renewables. For now, we have just 3% of the consumed electricity coming from renewables,” they said, adding that the parliament has started a campaign for prosumers.
Logistical issues
The war in Ukraine has damaged the prospects for a third reason.
“Our suppliers not only want to change the delivery point to Constanta or Varna, but they also don't even want to enter the Black Sea,” said Zveaghintev, noting that suppliers leave deliveries in Greece or Holland, so transport costs will increase dramatically. “Now we are trying to increase cooperation with Turkey.”
This development adds to the pandemic-related rise in costs of logistics and raw materials. Since the start of the pandemic, companies in the region have reported problems with supplies from China.
“Transport costs have skyrocketed. We have minimized our collaboration with China, and we have established partnerships in Turkey, Romania and Ukraine – countries that can be reached by truck, not by ship,” said Zveaghintev “We have partly solved the problem.”
However, Ukraine is now out of the equation. 
Over the past 30 years, since its independence, Moldova has done little to update its energy infrastructure. Government sources have confirmed that they are aware of that. 
“Intermittency issues are there. We cannot allocate more, despite the political and financial interest, because we don’t have storage capacity nor transmission capacity,” government sources told pv magazine. “We need interconnections to Romania and storage now to avoid intermittency issues to invest in renewables as a country. We want to allocate 235MW quotas for renewables by 2025, of which 70MW for renewables.”
According to official documents, the tariff for PV is now MDL 1.88 ($0.10)/kWh.
Zveaghintev said old infrastructure affects solar development.
“The transmission grids and substations are old. There have been many requests for connection over the years. So many, that they have exceeded the theoretical capacity of all the grids. Now the theoretical capacity of the networks is exhausted,” he said.
In this context, synchronization with the European network would play a significant role. The Ukrainian and Moldovan systems work in isolation from the Russian grid. Since Feb. 24, the day before the start of the Russian invasion, a test exercise was conducted, indicating that Moldova was ready to connect to the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E).
“One of the most important projects is the construction of the 400kW high-voltage network between Chisinau and Vulcanesti in the south of the country, where there is already an existing substation and transmission line connected to Romania – the Vulcanesti–Isaccea power line. By building this 400kW line to the capital and connecting to Romania, we will partially solve the problem of energy independence,” said Zveaghintev.
The timeframe is three years and feasibility studies have been completed. An award agreement was signed years ago, but the project was reportedly frozen due to political disputes. Development stopped until the new government came in, when the project was immediately unblocked. It is now in the design phase, with work set to start next year. 
Corruption concerns 
“I know about two PV companies in Moldova – one owned by former Prime Minister Chiril Gaburici, the second by former Economy Minister Christophe Bridé, a dual Moldovan-French citizen. The second has been involved in a huge corruption scandal … big banking fraud,” Valeriu Pasa, president of think tank WatchDog.MD, told pv magazine.
Zveaghintev said he disagrees, at least to a certain degree. 
“I am not really aware what happened before 2018 in energy sector in Moldova because I was part of diaspora. What I know is that Mr. Gaburici was prime minister and after that Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure. He knows very well the situation in energy sector and as per my understanding he is really interested in development of renewables in Moldova,” he said. “Why we didn’t see progress in this direction during his mandate as PM or minister remains an open question for me. He contribute to the construction of the first nearly 1MW photovoltaic park in operation since 2018. Right now he is busy with development and consulting on the plants; he is not active in construction.” 
Security considerations
Moldova is the country with the highest number of refugees as a proportion of the local population, at around 4%. The percentage is below 2% for Poland, Hungary and Romania. This is putting a strain on public finances. 
Pasa claims that the local banking system has significant funds, and he does not know how to mobilize them. That makes private funds a faster way to invest.
“The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank have some impact, but not much. Any process to get European funds would take at least three years,” he said.
Pasa argues that European funds have overly complicated procedures.
“There are so many costs like consultancy which are completely exaggerated. You can use these programs in Romania, where the funds are huge, but less so here,” he said.
He added that many EBRD-funded projects lag; sometimes, they do not even start.
“We have found cases of energy efficiency investments in newly built houses, or not even built. From 10 million euros, they just invested half a million. We need something replicable, instead,” said Pasa.
Zveaghintev said governments have implemented subsidies through European funds, via the AIPA government agency.
“This is helping to partially compensate for investments that farmers make in their sector, for example, a grain store or a cold store. This fund compensates farmers up to 50% from 2019,” Zveaghintev told pv magazine.
However, some local industry observers said the quotas for renewables are relatively limited.
“We will not have dramatic changes in the renewable energy sector. The government is not investing a lot, but private investment is growing,” said Pasa, adding that the best results would be achieved via investments in energy efficiency.
Everyone pv magazine spoke to agreed on the need to diversify electricity sources and reduce dependence on Transnistria's Kuchurgan station, which is owned by MGRES, a unit of Moscow-based Inter RAO. The Kuchurgan gas power station provides around 75% of the electricity consumed in Moldova.
However, at this point the war and security concerns will have to be factored into investment decisions. External support will also have to be considered, and every decision will need to be made on the basis of the war in Ukraine, which is Moldova's fourth-biggest trading partner. 
“Our country is small. The difference in irradiation between north and south is small; we are talking about few percentage points … almost irrelevant,” said Zveaghintev. “The southern region is slightly more interesting, especially for PPAs, which do not exist at the moment. For large plants over 5MW to 10MW, it would make sense. There are already feasibility studies for plants bigger than 10MW in the southern part of the country.”

Chinese inverter manufacturer Sungrow recently inaugurated its expanded scale of manufacturing capacity in India. The company, which started manufacturing solar inverters in India in 2018, has scaled the India factory to 10GW/annum capacity as it looks to better the reach to its customers locally and globally with lesser lead time and better service experience.
Bhagwanth Khuba, India's minister of state for new and renewable energy, virtually inaugurated the manufacturing unit. 
Sungrow, which had over 224GW installed worldwide as of December 2021, has supplied more than 11GW of inverters to India since entering the Indian solar market in 2014. With its 10GW manufacturing unit, Sungrow can cater to different customer segments, including residential, commercial, industrial and utility-scale levels, both locally and worldwide. 
“I appreciate this step of Sungrow, as well as its long-term development plan, which can help to realize our ambition of renewable energy mission,” Khuba said. “In the future, I hope Sungrow can keep leading this market and set the benchmark for the Indian solar industry, for the success of ‘Make in India’ Initiative.”
At the inauguration ceremony, Sungrow launched its new products in string and central inverter categories, including the SG350HX model and the 1+X modular inverter. 
SG350HX multi-MPPT string inverter for 1500 Vdc system features a maximum output power of 352 kW, supporting large-format high-efficiency and bifacial PV modules.
The 1+X modular central inverter solution for large-scale utility solar plants boasts modularization at the inverter level, the system level and the component level. With three-level modularization, it makes power plant design more flexible and post-O&M more convenient in the future.
Sunil Badesra, country head of Sungrow India, said, “Sungrow is very proud to be the only company which manufactures all types of PV plus ESS equipment domestically for the Indian market, and it also creates enormous opportunities for investment attraction and employment. In the future, we will work even harder to strengthen the supply chain further and assure the stable and efficient delivery for our customers.”

“Our system design is cost-competitive compared to a ventilated façade made of ceramic tiles,” the research project's corresponding author, Carlos García-Gáfaro, told pv magazine. “The additional costs for the photovoltaic system and its connection to the heat pump are amortized by the increased efficiency of the building energy system,” he also explained, noting that the overall system costs may be up to 20% higher compared to a system without the PV installation.
The system was simulated as being deployed at the Quality Control Laboratory of the Basque Government Building (LCCE) in the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz in northern Spain. The Paslink test cell and methodology were used to assess the thermal response of the building element in exterior conditions.
The PV-FVF is an architectural solution proposal consisting of a base wall with an insulating layer that is covered with a ventilated façade with a forced airflow chamber and PV-glass elements in the exterior layer. The ventilated façade had six 0.65 cm-thick 5%-efficient opaque photovoltaic glass layers based on amorphous silicon inserted between glass plates that were integrated with the building's structural load-bearing parts with an air gap of 10 cm. The connection between the PV-FVF and the heat pump is possible with normal metal ducts from the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) industry. The provider of the PV glass technology is Spanish specialist Onyx Solar.
In the proposed system configuration, the heat pump is expected to cover building heating demand at all times, regardless of the performance of the PV-FVF unit. “When the PV-FVF airflow extraction is running at a high velocity, the heat pump will function with greater efficiency. On cloudy days or at night, the PV-FVF functions on a low flow basis of 10 l/s. In such periods, the heat pump uses exterior air mixed with the said small flow coming from the PV-FVF,” the scientists explained, adding that the entire building is used as a thermal storage system by the setpoint temperature schedule, using one strategy named Tadaptive. “Its objective is to transfer the maximum thermal energy possible to the building when the façade is obtaining a higher solar thermal gain,” García-Gáfaro stated.
When airflow is induced through the wall's ventilated chamber, the PV-FVF element is able to act as a heating tunnel. The outer surface of the insulating layer is warmer at nighttime and the inner side of the PV layer is warmer during daytime periods. This, according to the scientists, has a positive effect on the convective processes of the airflow, as the convective heat transfer coefficient of the warmer surface is higher. The airflow was found to quickly reach the developed flow condition, both in temperature and velocity.
The system was simulated in a 54-dwelling residential building equipped with a heat pump for both space and water heating located in Madrid. “The results obtained indicate that the integration of PV-FVF and heat pump, combined with an underfloor heating system, reduces heating energy consumption by at least 19.9% and, coupled with the photovoltaic generation of the outer layer, reduces the annual total energy consumption, including domestic hot water, by at least 20.7%.”
The proposed system configuration is introduced in the study A photovoltaic forced ventilated façade (PV-FVF) as heat source for a heat pump: Assessing its energetical profit in nZEB buildings, which was recently published in Energy and Buildings. “Our model indicates that the extra costs represented by the PV system may be repaid in only four years,” García-Gáfaro concluded. “Further research is planned for this system. First, the assembly and monitoring of a prototype in an office building would be carried out. Later, the use of the airflow after passing through the heat pump as support of the heat recovery ventilation system will be evaluated.”

The PV system, when completely unfolded, can reach a surface of up to 80m2 thanks to the “butterfly wings” that can be deployed on both its sides. “The SolarButterly is being constructed with highly advanced materials including waste plastic gathered at sea and transformed through a unique process to be used as the main building material of the Butterfly,” the university said in a statement.
The solar modules for the SolarButterfly wings were supplied by Chinese manufacturer Longi, which is a major partner in the project.
The SolarButterfly is expected to travel around the world from May and to visit more than 1,000 locations hosting projects focusing on slowing climate change. The project will be implemented in phases starting with 22,000 kilometers across 32 countries in Europe,” the statement reads. “According to the planned route, the SolarButterfly will then visit five other continents finishing in Paris on December 12, 2025, just in time for the tenth anniversary of the climate agreement.”
During the trip, the SolarButterfly will also integrate a small TV studio to record and disseminate reports on sustainable solutions and pioneers via social media. “It will also be a highly energy efficient space with solar heated water and rainwater collection and purification for drinking,” the university explained.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/11/solar-plus-food-in-ethanol-fields-could-fully-power-the-united-states/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 11, 2022",Solar-plus-food in ethanol fields could fully power the United States,"From pv magazine USA
Ethanol emits more greenhouse gasses than the gasoline it is supposed to replace. Additionally, ethanol (corn) farms greatly under-utilize land, which is one of the greatest resources in the United States.
Of the 92 million acres of corn planted in the United States every year, roughly 40 million acres (1.6% of the nation’s land) are primarily used to feed cars and raise the octane of gasoline. If this land is repurposed with solar power, it could provide around three and a half times the electricity needs of the United States, which is equivalent to nearly eight times the energy that would be needed to power all of the nation’s passenger vehicles were they electrified.
However, if the nation were to transition this 40 million acres of fuel to solar-plus-food (agrivoltaics), it could still meet 100% of its electricity needs, while also powering a nationwide fleet of electric vehicles.
Recent research by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory suggests that utility-scale solar power in the United States generates between 394MWh and 447MWh per acre per year. Thus, just 1 acre of solar panels provides enough energy to propel America’s most popular electric vehicle – the Tesla Model Y – nearly 1.3 million miles per year.
In a good year, 1 acre of corn is expected to generate around 328 gallons of ethanol. Since ethanol contains only ⅔ the energy of gasoline, a comparable crossover SUV averaging 30 miles per gallon would travel only 6,600 miles per year on that acre of corn.
That’s not a typo – solar panels produce roughly 200 times more energy per acre than corn. This striking figure makes an ironclad case in favor of converting vehicles to electricity – and that’s before we take into account the environmental and health benefits which would result from the profound reduction in emissions.
The “recent” news that US ethanol emits 24% more emissions than gasoline, is in fact old news. Politics in the United States, influenced by agricultural industries, fossil-fueled fertilizer manufacturing, and perhaps a well-intentioned ulterior motive of underwriting food for national security, has led to a massive subsidy program for corn growers.

In fact, since 1980, pretty much all of the additional acres used to grow corn have gone towards fueling vehicles, not humans. We need not point fingers at farmers – they simply produce what the market demands. But these demands, which our civilization imposes on our soil, have resulted in far-reaching consequences.
Corn is particularly adept at siphoning nutrients from our soils. Restoring these nutrients requires fertilizers sourced from fossil-fuel feedstocks and produces more CO2 emission than any other human-driven chemical process on earth. Meanwhile, solar can help alleviate our nitrogen-fixation emissions crisis as well, by pulling fertilizer out of thin air.
With these factors in mind, we propose a new national security initiative – one that combines solar electricity generation with food production in order to solve many issues in one fell swoop. We urge landowners, developers, and legislators to prioritize the replacement of ethanol field corn with agrivoltaic operations. These operations should specifically target locations with the highest risk for fertilizer runoff. It’s time to bring our agrarian society into the 21st century.
And, just for the sake of fuel security, let’s incorporate some hydrogen generation into the picture as well.
#AgrivoltaicsforEthanol
About 40 million acres of ethanol field corn could be used to generate 14 petawatt-hours of solar electricity, if deployed in standard, highly efficient installation techniques. A reminder – that’s 3.5 times more energy than the current US electricity consumption.
However, that is not the goal. Even though the United States is still in the nascent stages of agrivoltaic development, it’s fair to say that solar-plus-food facilities will generate at least half the amount of electricity per acre as we leave space for farming machines. Analysis from Germany showed that potatoes could be grown at 80% of their initial volume, while electricity could also reach 80% of its potential.
In the scenario where we only get 50% of the solar output from the land, our repurposed acres would generate around 7 petawatt-hours of electricity per year. That’s eight times the amount of electricity required (~0.88 PWhrs/year) to push 3.26 trillion passenger car miles in the US every year, and enough left over to electrify the nation 1.5 times over.
Of course, we don’t need (or probably want just yet) to power the United States only via solar power. Thus we suggest powering the nation with only 50% solar – thus setting our electricity for our cars and our general power use around 16-21 million acres.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/11/trina-solar-launches-425w-rooftop-module-with-21-9-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 11, 2022",Trina Solar launches 425W rooftop module with 21.9% efficiency,"From pv magazine Australia
China's Trina Solar has unveiled a new addition to its Vertex solar module range. Its new Vertex S+ panels have a power output of up to 425W, with a maximum efficiency rating of 21.9%.
The new product, which uses 210 mm wafers and features double-glass design in place of the conventional glass-and-backsheet structure, has been specifically designed for residential installations and commercial and industrial (C&I) rooftop arrays.
Trina Solar Asia Pacific President Todd Li said on Thursday that the double-glass panel has been designed to resist performance degradation and delivered greater efficiency and durability, particularly in hot and humid environments.
“The Vertex S+ module we are launching today is ideally suited to Australia,” he said. “It is the very first 425W module in Australia that comes with double-glass, rather than backsheet. Double-glass is more durable, allowing the module to perform even in very hot or very hot and humid environments.”
Trina said the panel combines innovative technologies such as its N-type PACO Cell technology, 210 mm diameter wafers, multi-busbar (MBB), non-destructive cutting and high-density packing. Li said the installer-friendly Vertex S+ weighs in at 21.5 kg, making it ideal for Australian rooftops.
“The module has been designed for easy-to-handle installation thanks in part to its light weight and the fact it is compatible with existing mainstream mounting systems, optimizers and inverters for residential and C&I applications,” he said, noting that the Vertex S+ module comes with a 25-year product warranty and a 30-year power warranty.
Trina said the new, more powerful Vertex module is aligned with the trend in the Australia rooftop segment for more powerful systems. Li added that Australian households are now turning to higher- power modules to meet their needs, while C&I companies are turning to rooftop solar to offset rising electricity prices.
Trina expects to begin shipping the panels in April, with the first batch likely to arrive in Australia later that month. Li said the decision to launch the new module in Australia was deliberate, as it looks to “reinforce our position as Australia’s No. 1 solar module brand and to capitalise on the tremendous growth in the commercial, industrial and residential solar market here”.
“We anticipate that following today’s launch, we will further increase our lead in Australia as the country’s number-one brand of solar module,” he said.
Figures published in February by solar market research company Sunwiz show that Trina was Australia’s most popular module brand in 2021. In a recent report, Sunwiz said that Trina had increased its market share to 14%, as the nation rolled out a record 5.2GW of PV. It enjoys high market share across the residential, C&I and large-scale segments.
Trina launched its 670W Vertex panel in March 2021. A month earlier, it released the  390W-405W Vertex S panel in Australia.
