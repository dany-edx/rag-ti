The announcement was made during SolarPower Europe's annual summit in Brussels and aims to give Ukraine a steady supply solar materials.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked a solar rush across Europe as people sought to combat rising costs of energy with rooftop solar. In Ukraine, however, the energy system has been bombarded, leaving schools and hospitals in desperate need of solar and battery storage systems.
“In war, it is always the most vulnerable who suffer the most,” says German solar associations BSW co-president Jörg Ebel.  “This is why the German solar industry wanted to contribute to this campaign and kick off our ‘Solar Aid’ initiative so that we could equip schools with an improved electricity supply system.”

Russian missile strikes frequently target energy infrastructure, ensuring power outages are commonplace nationwide. “We have seen that the war caused tremendous energy poverty among the population,” said Director of Global Affairs at SolarPower Europe Maté Heisz. “And solar can really help to alleviate this energy poverty.”
The resulting demand for backup power sparked action from SolarPower Europe, the German solar power industry associations (BSW) and Ukrainian counterpart (ASEU) to launch the Solar Supports Ukraine donation campaign. 
Since the war began, numerous European companies have started donating truckloads of modules, batteries, inverters, and cables into the area. The new initiative aims at providing a coordinated platform and logistical plan for donations. 
Ukrainian organizations including Energy Act for Ukraine Foundation and the Repower Ukraine Foundation will enable and organize the implementation of the projects. The groups understand the needs of hospitals and schools and can conduct preliminary project assessments. The two organizations seek donors who fund specific projects and tender the implementation to Ukrainian electric installers.
To ensure transparency, corporate donors can view the detailed calculations of the selected project. “The donors can take guardianship over an entire project and this allows for an efficient delivery by enabling Ukrainian installers” explains Jochen Hauff, director of corporate strategy at BayWa re, among the first corporate donors of the campaign.
Rather than donating some modules or an inverter, a company can implement a complete PV system. Hauff explains that this saves on the coordination of component delivery and compatibility when a single installation can include donations from five or six different donors.
SolarPower Europe's Heisz said the deployment of solar to Ukraine needs to be accelerated, “hence we need to make it simple and empower our Ukrainian partners to scale up.” Heisz added that this call is already being heeded, with more than €70,000 donated from private donors before the summit.
“Currently, in unprecedented power shortages surgeons had to rely on headlamps to continue to operate,” says Artem Semenyshyn, CEO of the Solar Energy Association of Ukraine. In 2022, ASEU member companies installed battery storage systems at a hospital in Kharkiv. Semenyshyn says doctors from that hospital are pleased with the performance of their solar battery backup system. Considering diesel gen-sets need one minute to fire up properly and the donated battery system can provide uninterrupted power supply, this is no surprise. 
But there are many more hospitals where that came from. Since the invasion, Ukraine’s government has mandated hospitals purchase backup power supply systems but left open whether to use diesel gen-sets or solar battery systems. Some 4,500 larger hospitals require backup power. If equipped with a diesel gen-set, each would use about 200 liters of fuel daily and would not have uninterrupted power supply functions.
Eventually, Semenyshyn is convinced that if the government can see the resilience and usefulness of solar, he can make a great case in favor of rebuilding the country with the help of photovoltaics.
And for that, he needs more installers. But Semenyshyn has a plan. Apart from keeping the lights on, the program can also help injured civililians and soldiers too wounded to return to the frontlines, or those who are likely to lose their jobs. The CEO of ASEU says those who are wounded and traumatized can be retrained to install solar systems and help rebuild the country with solar power. 
At present, the project pipeline comprises three projects relating to schools and hospitals, one of which has been readily installed in Irpin, one is under construction, and one has been financed and is poised for construction in a few weeks. 
“We appeal to our members and to energy industry stakeholders for more donations to this cause,” says Ebel. “Every contribution will go a long way.”

“The Airfinity rooftop air-to-air units combine heating, cooling, and ventilation all in one package, for simplified installation and operation,” the Irish manufacturer says on its website. “They are suitable for a wide range of applications, particularly where low initial cost and easy installation are important.”
The new Airfinity S series is designed to connect directly to ductwork, with or without a roof curb, according to Trane.
The device is available in five different sizes, with heating capacities of 14.5 kW, 18.0 kW, 22.7 kW, 30.9 kW, and 37.4 kW, and cooling capacities of 16.5 kW, 20.2 kW, 24.6 kW, 32.9 kW, 38.4 kW. Their coefficient of performance (COP) is 3.82, 3.75, 3.72, 3.68, and 3.60, respectively.
The smallest heat pump measures 1,310 mm x 2,062 mm x 1,170 mm and weighs 393 kg. The largest measures 1,723 mm x 2,655 mm x 1,832 mm and weighs 697 kg.
The new device can purportedly be adapted to cold-climate applications by adding complementary heating sources such as electric heaters or hot water coils. “The smart Trane CH536 unit controller automatically manages multiple heat sources depending on climate conditions and the building load,” Trane stated.
It uses a scroll compressor that works in a circular motion, as opposed to up-and-down piston compressors. The units are designed to adapt the fan rotation speed according to building load and ventilation requirements, according to Trane. “Not only does this improve comfort for occupants by preventing cold drafts, it can also reduce energy consumption by 60% over the lifetime of the unit,” it added.
The device uses low global warming potential (GWP) R454B refrigerant.

French wind and solar energy company Valeco has published its first results from an agrivoltaic project combining solar generation with fodder production launched at the end of 2021.
The project is located in the French department of Saône-et-Loire and is being developed in partnership with local farmer Pôle ovin de Charolles, the Agricultural High School of Charolles (Eplefpa), and the Chamber of Agriculture of Saône-et-Loire. Its aim is to investigate how the presence of solar panels affects the quantity and quality of fodder growth and how sheep behave in an agrivoltaic environment.
The facility was divided into three units: an area hosting solar panels with module rows at a distance of 2.5 m, a second area with solar modules at a distance of 4 m between the rows, and a reference area without PV panels.
According to Valeco, the first year of testing has revealed that the shade provided by the solar panels makes it possible to protect the meadow from extreme climatic conditions. “The presence of the panels tends to smooth the annual curve of grass growth,” explained Michaël Floquet, director of operations at Eplefpa.
As expected, the trial showed that fodder growth under the panels slows in the spring. “But there is no lack of grass during this period on all the other plots and this is often under-exploited by the breeder,” Floquet said noting that, by contrast, there is more grass in winter and summer with food quality maintained longer.
Valeco found that the grass forms little or no ears under the panels, which makes it more digestible for the animals and allows it to maintain good nutritional quality for longer. What is more, autumn growth was unaffected by the panels, and between the rows the grass is of better quality than that growing in the control area without panels because it receives more direct light.
The trial showed no negative impact on sheep grazing either. On the contrary, sheep take advantage of the protection of the panels to rest, especially in summer when they seek shelter from heat or rain.
“The shade provided by the panels is definitely an asset to relieve the animals when the sunshine and the heat are too strong,” said Chamber of Agriculture of Saône et Loire Technical Manager Laurent Solas. “We can also identify improvements, in particular for a better distribution of rainfall under the panels. Testing is very relevant to adjust the configuration and create the best conditions for a perfect coexistence between the production of electricity and farming.”
Valeco is planning to build more agrivoltaic facilities with this configuration to test its validity on different crops and farms.

“The RW M6.1 series is especially suitable for application scenes of high power, limited installation space, restricted load-bearing, and long cycle life,” the manufacturer said.
Up to 32 battery modules can be connected in parallel, with capacities ranging from 6.14 kWh to 196.48 kWh. One module has a nominal voltage of 51.2 V, measures 460 mm x 720 mm x 143 mm, and weighs 55 kg. It is suitable for wall- or floor-mounted installation and has a depth of 160 mm with its hanging board.
“The low-voltage battery is a backup energy resource for household electricity usage application,” Deye stated. “The large-capacity storage is designed to provide homeowners an opportunity to maximize solar energy self-consumption, reducing power input from the grid and increasing the extra power output generated from the battery and PV solar.”
The new battery discharges at ambient temperatures ranging between -20 C and 55 C, and charges at temperatures between 0 C and 55 C. It comes with a 10-year warranty and reportedly has a lifecycle of more than 6,000 cycles.
The new product is IP65-rated and has been approved according to IEC 62619, and UN 38.3 certifications.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/13/greece-deployed-1-36-gw-of-new-solar-in-2022/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"MARCH 13, 2023",Greece deployed 1.36 GW of new solar in 2022,"According to preliminary figures made available to pv magazine by the Hellenic Association of Photovoltaic Companies (Helapco), Greece connected 1. 36 GW of new PV capacity to the grid in 2022. Of this, 341.5 MW was connected to Greece’s transmission grid and about 1020 MW was connected to Greece’s distribution grids. 
These figures are preliminary because Greece is yet to officially announce the number of its new PV deployments for 2022. The nation's renewable energy sources operator, Dapeep, has only published data covering the period until the end of September 2022. Dapeep’s data show that Greece installed 932 MW of new photovoltaic capacity in the first three quarters of last year, but does not include installations under net metering, which are announced separately by the country’s distribution grid operator Hedno.
Helapco's more complete statistical look at the PV market shows that net-metered systems comprise only a small fraction of the 1.36 GW of newly installed solar. 
Indeed, according to Helapco, Greece’s mainland grid connected 109.4 MW of net-metered PV, while Greece’s small isles, which operate stand-alone networks, added a further 1.4 MW of net-metered PV capacity. Interestingly, 5.4 MW of the net-metering capacity installed in 2022 on the mainland grid comprises virtual net metering systems.
Given the fact that commercial net-metered system installations more than doubled that of residential systems, the Greek government wants to boost the residential segment by introducing a new generous rebate scheme aiming specifically at residential solar-plus-storage. The government said the new scheme will be published shortly, possibly before the end of March, 2023.
Fixed tariffs continue driving growth
The newly installed PV capacity for 2022 is at least three times more than the 422 MW of new photovoltaics added in 2021. It comprises systems awarded premium tariffs via competitive tenders, small solar farms up to 500 kW that are entitled to feed-in tariffs, and net metered systems.
Helapco said that of the new systems connected to the grid, 200 or about 20 MW are connected to low voltage, 1,602 systems or about 890 MW are connected to medium voltage. and about 341.5 MW are linked to high voltage.

The event is the country's largest green energy trade show, and despite Indonesia's relatively small solar market, the event highlighted the region's increasing interest in new solar investment.
“We think Indonesia is still in the starting years and utility companies are now beginning to develop their first PV projects,” said Jimmy Shen, brand manager at Chinese module maker JinkoSolar, who added that while the show attracts fewer visitors than other countries, potential clients can still be found.
According to Lorca Wei, ASEN marketing manager at Chinese inverter manufacturer Sungrow, most of the Indonesian companies active in the solar business were present at the event. “We invited and met our major clients at this trade show, which we hope may have a higher number of visitors next year,” he said.
Growatt Sales Manager Anna Kang told pv magazine the event is an opportunity for the company to meet new and existing clients and, at the same time, showcase some of its new technologies. “We are among the three largest inverter suppliers in this country and we will definitely come back to this show next year,” she said.
The event also showed the attractiveness of Indonesia for solar module manufacturing. “We see the government as ready to transform the energy sector and the renewable energy industry,” said Elaine Zhu, marketing manager at Chinese PV production equipment supplier Autowell. “We also already have some clients here.”
Irene Li, sales manager at Chinese mounting system provider Mibet, added that Indonesia is an interesting market for floating PV, for which demand is constantly growing. “This event is a good platform to understand what Indonesia really needs.”
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Indonesia had around 211 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2021. The agency expects that the country may reach 66 GW of solar by 2030.
According to recent data published by IESR based on the solar resource mapping of NREL Re Explore, Indonesia has the technical potential to deploy up to 655 GW of cumulative rooftop PV capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/03/13/renewables-merger-and-acquisition-strategies-are-shifting/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 13, 2023",Renewables merger and acquisition strategies are shifting,"From pv magazine USA
CohnReznick Capital Markets shared that the 2o23 U.S. renewable energy market is expected to be defined by the the juxtaposition of tremendous momentum from recent changes in U.S. policy and uncertainty stemming from upheavals in global markets.
As the International Energy Agency expects 2,400 GW of renewables to come online through 2027, the world will add as much renewable energy capacity in the next five years as it did over the last two decades. With this market evolution comes the opportunity for significant merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, and the profile of this activity is expected to shift.
Throughout 2020 and 2021, M&A activity for renewables surged as valuations for platforms, which included project portfolios and corporate development teams that manage them, reached all-time highs. Now with increasing capital deployment rates, there is a shift from majority platform M&A activity to transactions in which investors could take a minority stake.
“Investors are providing growth capital in the form of a minority stake, often receiving preferred equity in a company that has the potential to grow and expand in the post-IRA world, in which company value could increase substantially over the next few years,” said CohnReznick in a whitepaper.
There is a growing trend of international players acquiring experienced U.S. developers with strong project portfolios, and CohnReznick said it expects this trend to continue in 2023. International independent power producers and infrastructure funds see acquisition as an efficient tool to enter or expand their presence in the growing North American market. Corporate M&A activity that includes developer experience and a portfolio of projects offers scale and transaction efficiency that the acquisition of individual projects aren’t able to match.
Now that the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit have been extended for projects that begin construction before 2034, independent power producers and infrastructure funds are looking to access a much larger project pipeline through acquisition, according to CohnReznick.
As the ITC now includes energy storage, this category is expected to drive more M&A activity as well. Mercom Capital reported there were 23 energy storage M&A transactions through the first three quarters of 2022 compared to 15 in 2021, a trend that is expected to continue as the energy storage market matures.
FTI Consulting said in a whitepaper that notable 2022 M&A transactions included Brookfield Renewable’s pair of acquisitions of Scout Clean Energy ($1 billion) and Standard Solar ($540 million), Enbridge’s acquisition of Texas wind developer Tri Global Energy for $270 million, and German energy producer RWE AG’s acquisition of Con Edison’s Clean Energy Businesses for $6.8 billion.
FTC Consulting said renewable investors not only continued to move up the value chain in search of financial returns but also diversified into emerging subsectors, such as renewable natural gas (RNG), alternative fuels and standalone storage. Notably, RNG transaction volume more than doubled in 2022, spearheaded by transactions like BP acquiring Archaea Energy for $4.1 billion.
FTC Consulting said that 2023 deal flow is expected to remain strong, but creative solutions and investor flexibility will be needed as the market navigates persistent supply chain challenges, long interconnection queues, and high inflation rates, all of which will apply downward pressure on asset sales.
To meet these challenges, investors are expected to seek right-priced deals and move towards emerging technologies and subsectors to receive a digestible risk-adjusted rate of return. FTC Consulting said corporates may look towards divestiture of non-core assets as a means to free up cash flow for more strategic investments or other operational drivers.
The report said it may take four to six months for guidance to be issued on specific aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act, and developers and asset owners will require time to assess the relative value of their investments and to implement financing plants to make the most of the IRA’s incentives.
“With patience, we anticipate strong M&A activity in traditional renewable assets, platforms and emerging technologies trending toward the second half of 2023 and into 2024 as greater clarity and increased value creation are established,” said the whitepaper.

The new method, which they defined as a one-stone-for-two-birds strategy, utilized a ligand known as 3-amidinopyridine (3AP) to pin anions in the device. Anions can control the nucleation and growth of the perovskite crystals and act as a passivating agent to improve the crystallinity, thus ensuring improved efficiency.
The scientists claim the 3AP molecules deposited on the perovskite layer are able to form strong chemical bonds with the cell's lead(II) iodide (Pb–I) interlayer and, as a consequence, create a sustainable pinning effect.
“We found that 3AP molecules were arranged in parallel and anti-symmetrically between Pb–I frameworks with a short interlayer distance of 3.45 angstrom (Å), which is much shorter than that obtained for previously reported ligands, leading to unique coordination within the crystals,” they explained.
The researchers built the cell with a substrate made of tin oxide (FTO), a titanium oxide (TiO2) electron transport layer, a halide perovskite known as α-formamidinium lead iodide known as α-FAPbI3, a spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer, and gold (Au) metal contact.
They evaluated the performance of the device via density functional theory (DFT) calculations and compared it with that of a reference cell utilizing commonly used large organic ligands such as 2-phenethylammonium (PEA) and n-butylammonium (BA).
The group found that the 3AP-based cell achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 25.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.181 V, a short-circuit current of 26.04 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 82.21%. The reference cell without 3AP molecules reached an efficiency of 22.76%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.123 V, a short-circuit current of 24.94 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 81%.
Through further measurements, the academics also ascertained that a 3AP-based cell without encapsulation was able to retain 92% of its initial efficiency after 5000 h exposure at ambient conditions. “The anion-vacancy defect engineering via strong molecule–perovskite coordination provides an effective and simple solution for increasing both the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells,” they stated.
They presented the new anion defects control strategy in the study “One-stone-for-two-birds strategy to attain beyond 25% perovskite solar cells,” published in nature communications. “Our findings offer an effective chemical strategy for the facile fabrication of high-performance stable perovskite solar cells and are potentially applicable to other perovskite optoelectronic devices,” they concluded.

The company said it will retain a majority stake in each tendered project and that the plants will be located in the islands of Java and Bali, as well as in the Aceh semi-autonomous province on the northwest part of Sumatra Island.
“Furthermore, in line with the direction of the Ministry of Industry to support the development of the national Solar PV industry, PLN IP would also support the invitation of Tier-1 Solar PV manufacturers who intend to set up factories in Indonesia to contribute towards meeting the local content requirements,” PLN IP said in the tender document.
Interested investors and manufacturers will have time until March 16 to submit their proposals.
In January, PT PLN Nusantara Power, another unit of PT PLN, launched the pre-qualification process for a tender to deploy a 100 MW floating solar plant. In 2020, PLN tendered two floating PV projects with capacities of 60 MW and 90 MW. The final prices came in at $0.0374/kWh and $0.0368/kWh, respectively.
Indonesia began supporting large-scale PV via a law issued in April 2017. The country’s cumulative installed PV capacity remains negligible, at roughly 211 MW by the end of 2021, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
