In a Series C funding round announced this week, the Chinese unicorn (an unlisted company valued at or above $1 billion) said that it has raised more than CNY 4.5 billion.
The company will primarily use the funds to expand production capacity, procure advanced equipment, conduct tech R&D, and further develop market opportunities.
The round was co-led by investors China Life Private Equity Investment and BFS Capital, along with BOC Financial Asset Investment, Goldstone Investment, CS Capital, China Venture Capital Fund (CVC), CICC Capital, CDH Investments, and China-US Green Fund.
Additional investors include CDI New Energy Investment (Shenzhen), Hefei Innovation Scitech Venture Capital, as well as existing shareholders Hainan Fenghe Private Equity Management, Matrix, ABC International, and ZBGT.
Established only four years ago, the company is expanding from 15 GWh to 70 GWh by the year’s end, and up to 135 GWh by 2025. It has attracted a long list of investors, which is not publicly available.
“More than 50% of them are institutional investors and the rest is coming from strategic investors, such as downstream application and mining companies,” Hithium VP for Sales and Marketing Mizhi Zhang told pv magazine at Intersolar 2023.
He said Hithium, which does not make EV batteries and solely specializes in stationary energy storage systems, has attracted funding by virtue of its innovative technology. Its lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathodes are designed to slowly release lithium ions, resulting in lower cell degradation.
“Unlike other LFP cells, Hithium’s 300 Ah battery cell displays less than 2% of degradation in the first 1000 cycles,” Zhang said.
This can in turn expand the battery lifespan to more than 12,000 cycles, and if operated properly that could translate into 20 to 25 years of service.
Outside of Xiamen, Hithium has more locations for production, research, and sales in Shenzhen, Chongqing, Munich, and California. Manufacturing in Europe is also in the cards, Zhang told pv magazine.
Reuters reported that Hithium has also approached officials and industry managers in Vietnam to potentially invest up to $900 million to build a plant on more than 30 hectares of industrial land.
The company has shipped 9 GWh of battery capacity to date, with 5 GWh delivered in 2022 alone. It said it expects to deploy more gigawatts, in the single digits, globally this year.
More than 85% of its system are deployed in China, including in a 220 MW/440 MWh system  in China's Ningxia region. It is reportedly the country’s largest standalone grid-connected battery energy storage system to date.

Elera Renováveis inaugurated a 1.2 GW solar complex this week in Janaúba, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The project is the largest operational PV facility in the Americas.
Prior to the commissioning of the plant, the largest operational PV project in North and South America was the Villanueva project, which consists of the 427 MW Villanueva I and 327 MW Villanueva III installations in the Mexican state of Coahuila.
Elera Renováveis said it invested BRL 4 billion ($819 million) in the Janaúba project, which consists of 20 solar parks spread across a surface of around 3,000 hectares. The Brazilian renewables developer began construction in January 2021.
In 2021, Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES), approved BRL 1.47 billion of financing for 14 plants in the complex, equivalent to 72% of the total planned investment of BRL 2.04 billion.
The complex features tracking systems from US-based Nextracker.
Janaúba has one of the highest concentration of utility-scale solar projects among Brazilian municipalities. It has published a video clip to show the first images of the huge facility on its YouTube channel.

The French government is currently defining its roadmap for the revival of nuclear power. However, some members of the scientific community oppose its plans to accelerate the development of new sites and facilitate the maintenance of existing power stations.
A newly launched platform of around 800 scientists is now calling for the end of the new French nuclear program. The state plan involves the construction of six new nuclear reactors at a total estimated cost of around €60 billion ($65.35 billion).
“This would divert for a long time the means necessary to face the combined challenges of the climate crisis, the collapse of life, generalized pollution, and the depletion of resources,” the oppositions scientists said.
The signatories have also drawn attention to the problematic management of nuclear waste and the monopoly of nuclear power in energy development policies.
“Today, any criticism of nuclear technology, subject to double industrial secrecy and military, has become extremely difficult within the laboratories and institutes linked to it,” they said.
The scientists also warned about the notion that nuclear power is a sustainable source of energy in the context of the climate emergency.
“The scarcity of fresh water and the reduction in the flow of rivers linked to a soon-to-be chronic drought in France, as well as the risks of submersion of coastal areas, due to the rise in the level of the oceans and the multiplication of events extreme weather conditions, will make the operation of nuclear facilities very problematic,” they said, noting that the cooling of nuclear power plants is the third-biggest source of water consumption in France.
According to data from the Ministry of Ecological Transition, nuclear energy currently require around 12% of water resources, behind agriculture and the consumption of drinking water.
“Betting on new reactors, the first of which would at best be commissioned in 2037, will in no way enable us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions today and drastically, as the climate emergency requires,” the scientists said.
On June 21, the Constitutional Council validated the law to revive nuclear power. However, the institution found critical aspects in 10 of the 30 articles of the law. In particular, it rejected the modifications to the energy code, which aimed to take low-carbon hydrogen into account in the objectives of the national energy policy and in the multi-annual energy program.
However, the council acknowledged that the proposed nuclear development is justified by its contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and that it is of major interest for the protection of the environment and the energy independence of France.
“The Constitutional Council recalls, in this respect, that it is not for it to determine whether the objectives set by the legislator could have been achieved by other means, since the methods adopted by law are not, in the state of scientific and technical knowledge, manifestly inappropriate for these purposes,” they said.

Throughout that period, solar had the highest share among renewable energy sources, followed by onshore wind (14.2%), offshore wind (8.6%), biomass (7.8%), and hydropower (0.1%). Collectively, renewables accounted for 49.6% of the electricity mix, up from around 43% in the preceding year.
“In June, PV scored a new peak, with more than a third of all electricity,” said the Nationaal Klimaat Platform. “June had approximately 140 hours when sustainable electricity production from solar and wind was greater than the total electricity demand in the Netherlands.”
The agency said that the increase in the share of renewable energy was mainly due to a decrease in total electricity consumption throughout the first half. It noted that clean energy could soon surpass the 50% mark, as more wind and solar power plants are expected to go online by the end of this year.
The rise in electricity production from renewables did not lead to negative prices, the agency said, adding that demand from neighboring contries helped to prevent such a scenario from materializing. 
The Netherlands could reach between 100 GW and 180 GW of total installed solar capacity by 2050, according to a new report by Netbeheer Nederland, the Dutch association of national-regional electricity and gas network operators.
The country hit 16.5 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity at the end of June 2022, according to the most recent figures from CBS, the national statistics agency. It said the nation installed 3,803 MW in 2021 and 3,882 MW in 2022.

The rebates will be available to installations that operate under the country's net metering scheme, which was introduced in December 2021. Prior to the latest announcement, rebates were only awarded to residential PV systems below 6 kW in size.
The rebates for commercial and industrial systems will range from €2,700  to €162,600 and will cover up to 30% of the funds needed to buy and install solar arrays.
“The amended scheme will operate on an introductory basis to the end of 2023 following which it will be assessed and subject to the normal budgetary process into 2024-25,” SEAI said, noting that the new rebates will cost up to €15 million in 2023. “SEAI will implement the necessary changes and will open for applications under the amended scheme guidelines in mid-July.”
“This move by government shows Ireland’s continued commitment to supporting all of our citizens, businesses and community organizations – to be part of our journey to a cleaner, cheaper and renewable energy future,” said Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/06/utilities-can-you-dg-it/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",,"JULY 6, 2023","Utilities, can you DG it?","From pv magazine 06/23
Two of the biggest solar markets, the United States and China, expanded their distributed-generation capacity by more than 65% in 2021 and 2022, against a 4% fall and an 18% rebound in utility scale PV. That means a qualitative shift in financing, in particular to back the integration of mass, networked, distributed-energy resources (DER) under virtual power plants (VPPs) and traditional utilities. Rethink Technology Research believes that utilities, especially in the United States, plan to participate in mass distributed-solar rollout. We think they will offer to partner with residential and commercial and industrial (C&I) property owners and act as a bridge to finance.
While net metering payments and reduced electricity sales might spook utilities, electric companies have tremendous balance sheets to borrow against and can recruit “full scale” distributed-generation (DG) customers, equipped to their maximum solar roof and energy storage potential.
The first power company to embrace this change will be imitated by others because the alternative is to be abandoned by customers wealthy enough to go full scale distributed alone, free from grid reliance. Utilities that rent roofs back to customers unable to purchase PV arrays outright will open the market to more solar customers and safeguard themselves from falling energy prices while retaining control of power generation.
With half of the world’s electricity to come from solar in future – and half of that DG arrays – utilities will have to embrace the VPPs expected to become widespread in the US in the next two years, and later in Australia, parts of Europe, and, potentially strong DER markets such as Japan.
The Rocky Mountain Institute, a sustainability thinktank, announced a virtual power plant partnership in January with General Motors. It also announced agreements with Ford, Sunpower, Sunrun, home-automation specialist Google Nest, and the OhmConnect energy-efficiency program. In addition, it started working with Olivine, an energy demand-response specialist, and SPAN, which provides home energy-consumption panels. It also collaborates with VPP developer SwitchDin and Virtual Peaker, a residential electric demand software platform.
Utilities in the United States and elsewhere are already obliged to enable VPPs on their grids, meaning they must track and model VPP grid participation. More than two-thirds of US electricity meters at the end of 2021 were smart devices, with 120 million now installed.

Independent aggregators are now pushing VPPs, meaning more generation and storage is taken out of the hands of utilities until they join the market. If more than 60% of solar capacity is small scale, a similar volume of storage capacity can be expected, paid for by homeowners or whoever paid for the systems, and will be attached to a revenue-generating VPP.
Despite rising solar prices, Rethink Energy estimates the global PV industry grew 30% last year, with 221 GW added, and will rise 50% this year and in 2024, based on 330 GW of annual solar manufacturing capacity last year, plus 45 GW per month more this year.
We estimate rooftop panels accounted for 57% of the solar added last year and will stay above 50% through mid-2025, with DG numbers rising in the US, China, and most other big markets. While high module prices and other supply chain issues affected utility scale plants, war in Ukraine prompted people and businesses to go solar to safeguard energy security.
Rethink Energy expects the pendulum to swing back to utility from 2025 to 2030, as manufacturing bottlenecks ease and module prices – which make up around 40% of project costs – return to the price decline curve which prevailed until mid-2020. Prices topped $300 per kilowatt of generation capacity in late 2021 but have now subsided below $240/kW, before shipping, and will reach $200/kW in 2025.

DG systems will retake the crown from 2031, to hit 63% of all new installations in 2050. Both will boom and while hundreds of gigawatts of capacity in Australian and Chilean deserts alone will power green hydrogen, DG’s potential will be even greater, driven by energy prices.
Distributed solar has so many cost factors that the price spike in polysilicon – which still accounts for more than 25% of module costs – barely changed the financial formula, enabling small-scale PV to dominate. Many countries have boosted rooftop solar with new policies but these are simply riding the wave, not causing it.
In 2027, utility-scale solar will, for a brief moment, once again enjoy the 57% share of new installs it held before the pandemic. From that point on, multiple long-term trends will work in favor of distributed PV – with one of them being the “next big limiting factor” of the solar industry – transmission. In 2031, the two sectors will return to parity, as distributed prepares to take over for the second time.

Prasham Greens, an Indian PV module cleaning specialist, has designed water-draining clamps to remove water from the edges of the solar panels after rain or water-based cleaning sessions.
Water accumulation at the edges of solar panels can cause the build-up of mud and dirt, resulting in reduced panel lifespan and power generation due to hotspots, scaling, and shadowing effects.
Prasham offers water-draining clamps that can be easily installed on the panel frame to prevent soiling. According to the company, these clamps can enhance power generation by 2% to 10%.
Made of a high-tensile strength ABS-based composite material, the clamps are resistant to physical impacts and chemical corrosion. They are also cost-effective, nontoxic, and environmentally friendly when recycled.
“Only ABS material is not enough to sustain for a long period in sunlight as it gets brittle. So, we add four types of different chemicals to improve its lifespan to around 10 to 12 years,” Prasham Greens CEO Jainam Shah told pv magazine.
The clamps are available in sizes suitable for 35 mm and 40 mm PV panel frames.

In the study “Optimal ground coverage ratios for tracked, fixed-tilt, and vertical photovoltaic systems for latitudes up to 75°N,” published in Solar Energy, the scientists said the new guidelines are applicable to projects based on both monofacial and bifacial modules that are located at latitudes between 17°N and 75°N.
They selected, in particular, 31 locations in Mexico, the United States, and Canada.
“Where possible, the locations represent multiple diffuse fractions within a given latitude range, with diffuse fraction defined as the annually-averaged ratio of diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI) to global horizontal irradiance (GHI),” they specified. “The analysis we have presented has been conducted for North American locations, but covers a wide range of operating conditions, including diffuse fractions between 0.23 and 0.55, average GHI-weighted ambient temperatures of −4 C to 31 C, average GHI-weighted albedos between 0.10 and 0.65, and city elevations between 1 and 1600 m.”
The Canadian group used PV performance prediction software Duet, an open-access cloud-based solar project designing tool developed by the University of Ottawa itself, to create 3D models including mounting structures and multiple rows.
“Optical calculations are then completed considering direct beam radiation, anisotropic diffuse sky radiation, and ground-reflected radiation by segmenting the modules, ground, and diffuse sky-dome into patches,” the researchers explained. “A shading algorithm is implemented using a deterministic ray intersection method to capture the effect of objects in the 3D scene.”
The academics said that Duet software is able to translate the irradiance profiles into per-timestep cell I–V curves through a temperature and irradiance-dependent single-diode model, noting that they calculated the effect of ground coverage ratios between 0 and 1 on both monofacial and bifacial fixed-tilt and horizontal single-axis tracked (HSAT) systems.
The research group found that GCR may vary consistently between 0.15–0.68 for fixed-tilt systems and less significantly between 0.17–0.32 for HSAT systems, and said for both cases values depend strongly on latitude. “Similarly, the optimal tilt of fixed-tilt arrays varies widely from 7° above latitude-tilt to 60° below latitude-tilt, depending on the latitude and GCR,” it highlighted, adding that vertical systems are less sensitive to latitude.
The scientists also found that bifacial PV systems require GCRs up to 0.03 lower than monofacial GCRs. “Since latitude was the dominating factor affecting inter-row energy yield loss, our results should provide an estimate of the performance of equivalent PV arrays across the globe,” they concluded.

“Power plants built in 2009–2010 have reached the end of their lifetime today,” is the astonishing conclusion drawn by the researchers. “In the years 2009–2010, the expected lifetime of PV power plants in the Czech Republic was 20–25 years. Today, after about 12 years, it turns out that this estimate was too optimistic and the real lifetime is about half.”
The academics said all the facilities are monitored via the same monitoring system – Solarmon-2.0 – and explained that the plants showed very similar results, noting that the main cause of panel degradation was delamination. They said the modules used at the facilities were provided mostly by Tier 1 manufacturers without providing their names. They also noted that most of the modules had glass/EVA/TPT laminate design and are installed with an inclination of 35 degrees.
They also explained that the main cause for the reduced lifetime of the solar farms was not only due to a poor estimation of the technical possibilities of the PV panels at the time of planning and installation, but also to a profit-led approach aimed at lowering the costs of the projects. “For example, weaker frames or a smaller distance between the PV cells and the grounded frame of the PV panel are used,” they added. “At the same time, the electrical voltage increases in a series-connected string of PV panels.”
Through its analysis, the group ascertained that the performance of the plants was quite in line with expectations for the first 10 years, but it discovered then that the frequency and number of failures increases considerably from the 11th year. “After the 11th year, the performance of the panel without the use of siloxane renovation (or another repair means) decreases so much that it needs to be replaced completely,” it emphasized.
In the latest issue of pv magazine we turn the spotlight onto European solar with a comprehensive review of the state of the PV industry across the region’s key markets and a look at the legislation which aims to drive a solar rooftop boom. We also examine the difficulty of establishing a solar panel recycling industry in Australia, where industry backbiting isn’t helping matters.
The researchers also conducted an economic analysis of the results provided by the monitoring data and found that the plants were still profitable, although with much lower margins than originally planned. “With the current relatively high electricity prices (end of 2022), the payback period of power plants falls significantly below 10 years, which in the current situation, would be enough to cover investment costs,” they stated. “However, any decrease in the lifetime of the panels results in a lower return on these investments.”
Their findings were presented in the paper “Reduced real lifetime of PV panels – Economic consequences,” which was recently published in Solar Energy. “The new information could be helpful for owners of PV power plants to get a more realistic estimation of profits,” they concluded.

Its latest report suggests that this year, the nation will add approximately 5,981 MW, followed by 4,392 MW in 2024 and 3,996 MW in 2025.
“The most remarkable change and growth are expected in the segment of large-scale farms and among commercial prosumers,” IEO researcher Agata Krzyżanowska told pv magazine. “Temporarily problems with full access to the grid and very high electricity prices for commercial consumers will facilitate faster development of business prosumers' investments in small installations up to 50 kW or bigger under the net billing scheme, focusing on green power auto consumption.”
The IEO said renewable energy auctions in the 2016-21 period were a success and a stimulus for the development of mostly large PV projects. They provided support for 6.8 GW of solar power and 5.3 GW for wind power.
“However, in the years 2021-22, a decreased interest in the auction support instrument could be observed, since the PV technology is considered as matured and energy prices grew during Russia’s gas blackmail and the power crisis,” Krzyżanowska said. “Investors decided to build farms on fully commercial principles, through the energy sale on the market, including [power purchase agreements].”
In the last auction of 2021, investors offered only a portion of the capacity, leaving a significant portion for PPA contracts. With the introduction of a price cap for PV and wind in 2022 and the decline in power prices in 2023, the upcoming autumn auction is expected to be more attractive. However, it is expected that the auction volume will be diversified in the future.
During the 2016-22 period, energy prices contracted in the auction system for PV farms decreased by 18%, while average selling prices of electric power on the competitive market in Poland increased by 68%. In contrast, solar module prices experienced a significant increase in 2021 and 2022.
“According to surveys conducted by IEO among PV market participants, in 2021, PV module prices in Poland increased by 7%, and in 2022 – by 12% and the inflation is still over 10%,” said Krzyżanowska.
Krzyżanowska said that developers of PV projects are also dealing with serious grid connection issues in Poland. However, these constraints do not represent a true barrier to solar deployment.
“The constraints caused by more often rejections since 2022 of applications for grid connection are expected not to slow down the PV industry's development pace until at least 2025,” she said. “There is still a 6 GW pipeline of projects with grid connection permits, and grid operators plan to expand grid connection capacities for hosting PV in the coming years.”
Krzyżanowska mentioned that the Polish government will offer financial incentives for grid modernization through the National Reconstruction Plan and the EU Cohesion Fund. System operators are also expected to adopt a new approach that considers economic needs and embraces technical solutions like cable pooling, hybrid installations, direct lines, and the use of batteries and other energy storage methods.
“Such measures were approved in June by Polish Parliament,” she explained. “Also, the ongoing RES auction system will remain open until 2027, which will undoubtedly contribute to the mobilization of financial institutions and further growth of large-scale PV investments in the Vistula River country.”

Cleantech Solar has signed long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) for 60 MWp of solar PV projects in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
The developer said leading commercial & industrial (C&I) customers will buy the energy from these projects to power their operations in the state. Cleantech is developing these projects at its state-of-the-art solar park in Tirunelveli district, Tamil Nadu.
Singapore-based Cleantech Solar is a pan-Asia supplier of renewable energy to corporates. It has numerous solar and wind projects across India and Southeast Asia, covering approximately 1 GWp of assets in operations, construction, and development stages. This includes installations in India, Singapore, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The company is backed by long-term strategic shareholders including Keppel Corp., Keppel Asia Infrastructure Fund, and Shell Singapore.

Ausgrid said that a 30 kVA/60 kWh EcoStore pole-mounted storage system in Maitland, Australia, will support all properties connected to the local distribution network, helping to maximize the value of rooftop solar energy while also improving grid reliability.
The EcoStore battery energy storage system, supplied by Queensland-based manufacturer EcoJoule Energy, features three pole-mounted cabinets, each containing a 10 kVA/21.9 kWh battery coordinated to operate as a three-phase system. Ecojoule said the system is fitted with in-built network support technology which can improve the voltage delivered to consumers as well as reduce phase unbalance.
The Maitland battery is the first of several pole-mounted community battery energy storage systems that Ausgrid plans to deploy with additional pole-top batteries to be installed at strategic locations across its distribution network in the coming weeks.
Ausgrid said the trial of pole-mounted batteries will complement the network operator’s larger community battery program and will improve its understanding of solutions to support the growth of renewable energy in its networks.
Junayd Hollis, Ausgrid’s asset management executive general manager, said he expects the trial to demonstrate the ability of pole-mounted battery energy storage systems to improve network hosting capacity, reduce voltage imbalance and manage peak loads.
“Pole-top batteries will play a crucial role in integrating more renewable energy into the grid,” he said. “They can store excess energy generated during periods of high production and release it during times of low production or high demand.”
Hollis said that if successful, the pole-top battery systems could eliminate the need for more extensive network augmentation that would otherwise be necessary to address network constraints.
The installation of the pole-top battery comes just days after Ausgrid announced that it is partnering with the federal government to deliver six new community batteries for Sydney and Central Coast communities.
The projects are being jointly funded and planned in partnership with Ausgrid and the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water’s Community Batteries for Household Solar Program. The batteries will be installed in Bondi, Cabarita, Cammeray, Narara, North Epping, and Warriewood.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/07/06/californias-electricity-duck-curve-is-deepening/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 6, 2023",California’s electricity duck curve is deepening,"From pv magazine USA
The phenomenon of the “duck curve” is an electric grid operation concept that signifies the mismatch between peak solar generation (midday to afternoon) and peak electricity demand (late afternoon and evenings). Shaped like the outline of a duck, the curve shows the peaks and valleys of this mismatch throughout a typical day.
The experience of a duck curve can cause stress on the grid and challenges for the electricity market, causing California and other solar-friendly states to boost adoption of energy storage to meet these challenges.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) shared that as solar adoption grows in California, the “duck curve” is deepening. The midday dip in net load is getting lower, making it more difficult for the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to balance the grid.
The swing in demand for electricity from conventional power plants from midday to late evenings, when energy demand is still high but solar generation has dropped off, means that conventional power plants like natural gas-fired peaker plants must rapidly ramp up electricity production to meet demand. That rapid ramp up makes it more difficult for grid operators to match grid supply with grid demand in real time, a mechanism that balances the grid both physically and in the wholesale marketplace.
Additionally, if more solar power is produced than can be used, operators may have to curtail, or deliberately shut off, solar assets to avoid over generation. The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) curtailed 1.5 million MWh of utility-scale solar in 2020, representing 5% of total production, according to EIA. Solar is by far the most dominant source of energy that undergoes curtailment in the state. EIA said 94% of power curtailments in 2020 involved solar energy.
Curtailments reach a peak in the spring months, where demand is relatively low and solar output is relatively high. For example, in the early afternoon hours of March 2021, an average of 15% of utility-scale solar was curtailed, CAISO data showed as reported by the Energy Department.
EIA also warned that the duck curve scenario also challenges traditional, dispatchable energy sources by making it uneconomical to operate them around the clock. This harm to a given facility’s revenue may lead to a retirement of the facility without a highly dispatchable replacement, the EIA said.
“Less dispatchable electricity makes it harder for grid managers to balance electricity supply and demand in a system with wide swings in net demand,” said the EIA.
However, the duck curve has opened the door for energy storage to meet the grid-balancing needs of California and other renewables-based economies.
“The large-scale deployment of energy storage systems, such as batteries, allow some solar energy generated during the day to be stored and saved for later, after the sun sets,” said the EIA. “Storing some midday solar generation flattens the duck’s curve, and dispatching the stored solar generation in the evening shortens the duck’s neck.”
Battery energy storage in California has quickly grown from 200 MW in 2018 to nearly 5 GW today. Operators plan another 4.5 GW of storage capacity in the state by the end of the year according to EIA data, suggesting the solar-plus-battery boom has only just begun.
Despite its higher total project costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price, said global risk assurance firm DNV. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive. 
“PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants,” said DNV.
In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects worldwide will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.
