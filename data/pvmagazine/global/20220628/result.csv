The company, which is the largest manufacturer of heavy trucks in China, claimed the fuel cell engines have a peak efficiency of 60%.
Yunnan University researchers and scientists from Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting and Finance have released a report claiming that liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) are among the most important emerging hydrogen storage materials of recent years. The report, published in Frontiers in Energy Research, noted that proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have “stronger development momentum,” followed by solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). The researchers said the technological solutions with the highest combined utility value are hydrogen-inorganic salts-SOFC, hydrogen-carbon nanomaterials-SOFC, and hydrogen-metal hydrides-SOFC.
AEG Power Solutions has revealed that it will deliver eight Thyrobox DC-3 systems to Siemens Energy. The DC systems, each consisting of four power modules, will provide power for hydrogen production at the CEOG (Centrale Électrique de l'Ouest Guyanais) project. It described CEOG as the “world's largest power plant,” combining PV with up to 128 MWh of green hydrogen energy storage in French Guiana. The hydrogen yield of 860 tons per year will be produced by a 16 MW electrolysis platform, stored under pressure in hydrogen storage tanks. AEG Power Solutions claimed that by the second quarter of 2024, the plant will start providing 24/7 electricity via high-power fuel cells in a reverse electrolysis process at a competitive price to local thermal power plants.
Ceres Power has agreed to deliver a megawatt-scale solid oxide electrolyzer (SOEC) demonstrator to a Shell facility next year in Bangalore, India. The UK company said it aims to produce hydrogen at efficiencies ranging up to 90%, partly by using waste heat in industrial processes. Shell said the pilot will help to turn SOECs into a commercially mature technology on an industrial scale.
Linde claims that its newly completed hydrogen train refueling station in Bremervörde, Germany, is one of the biggest such facilities in the world. Fourteen Alstom trains will use the station to travel through Lower Saxony. Linde and Alstom are set to discuss the filling station and the trains in a webinar on June 29.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/06/28/california-moves-closer-to-opt-in-dynamic-pricing-to-balance-renewables/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"JUNE 28, 2022",California moves closer to opt-in dynamic pricing to balance renewables,"From pv magazine USA
Energy division staff of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) have proposed that the commission should launch a rulemaking proceeding on opt-in dynamic pricing of electricity.
For customers that have equipment that can automatically respond to price signals, opt-in dynamic pricing would shift some electricity consumption to times when prices are low – for instance, at times of high renewable generation – while reducing consumption when the grid is under stress and prices are high. The staff proposal envisions that the CPUC, by acting on dynamic pricing, could drive widespread customer adoption of technologies that can respond to price signals.
Following a successful dynamic pricing pilot funded by the California Energy Commission, the CPUC recently approved two more dynamic rate pilots. Customer equipment eligible for the pilots has included air conditioners, heat pumps, electric vehicle chargers, battery storage, agricultural irrigation pumps, and industrial process equipment.
The CPUC favors cost-based dynamic rates that improve grid resource utilization and “equitable” grid integration of DERs, the staff proposal says, citing the CPUC’s DER Action Plan. The staff proposal would achieve “fair” compensation for customer-owned DERs that is “linked to avoided marginal costs,” the proposal says.
With an opt-in dynamic pricing program, both participants and non-participants would save money on their electric bills, according to a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory modeling study described in the CPUC staff proposal. Customer bills would be reduced 10% to 17%, and savings from nationwide adoption would range from $33 billion to $50 billion per year, PNNL’s modeling showed.
DER industry support
Nine DER providers and advocacy groups supported a draft version of the CPUC staff proposal, in joint informal comments submitted last year, following a CPUC workshop, according to a summary provided in the staff proposal. Their joint comments said that the scope of a rulemaking should include the “method for crediting exported energy at retail price, and interaction with reforms to net energy metering being contemplated” under a CPUC rulemaking. The nine parties were Enel X, California Energy Storage Alliance, California Solar & Storage Association, Sunrun, Vote Solar, Tesla, EDF Renewables, Nuvve, and Stem.
Customer protection
Dynamic prices under the CPUC staff’s proposal would include several price components, beginning with the location-specific real-time wholesale price of electricity.
The proposal discusses the extremely high wholesale electricity prices in Texas in February 2021, when extreme cold weather led to multiple days of large-scale outages. The high wholesale prices were passed on to the real-time pricing customers of Griddy, a retail electricity provider. California dynamic pricing customers would be protected from extreme prices, the staff proposal says, in part because California has grid connections to neighboring regions, while the Texas grid is isolated, and because California has a resource adequacy program, or capacity market, which is designed to help ensure an adequate reserve of generating capacity, and which Texas does not have.
The staff proposal recommends that a CPUC rulemaking should explore assurances of customer protection during such reliability events.
Bidirectional pricing
Other electricity price components, besides the location-specific real-time wholesale price, would be a dynamic capacity charge based on real-time grid utilization, and price components to recover costs of generation, transmission and distribution services and other fixed costs.
Ultimately, the proposal envisions “bidirectional” electricity prices, with customers importing or exporting energy at the same dynamic composite price.
The California Energy Commission has created an online, universally accessible customer rate database known as MIDAS, and has proposed to adopt regulations that would facilitate the use of MIDAS for a dynamic pricing program, the CPUC staff proposal says.
California has reached this stage of preparedness for dynamic pricing at a time when solar provides more than 25% of the state’s electricity, and wind power provides nearly 8%.
The CPUC staff proposal, which incorporates a white paper discussing the need for demand flexibility and the limitations of current approaches, is titled “Advanced strategies for demand flexibility management and customer DER compensation.” A workshop on the proposal is planned for July 21, 2022.

A joint recall with Health Canada, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (US CPSC) and SunVilla Corp. has been issued for all 10-foot solar LED market umbrellas. The umbrellas have LED lights on the arms of the umbrella that are powered by a lithium-ion battery charged with a small solar panel.
The recall was issued after reports of batteries overheating and causing fires in the United States and Canada. In three reported incidents, the solar panels caught fire while charging via the AC adapter indoors.
Lithium-ion batteries have been known to cause fires in the past. Last year, LG Energy Solution Michigan issued a recall for its RESU 10H batteries in the US market that affected about 10,000 storage systems.
“The home batteries can overheat, posing a risk of fire and emission of harmful smoke,” the manufacturer said at the time.
Battery manufacturers are increasingly turning to less hazardous solutions. After its recall, LG transitioned from nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery chemistry to lithium iron phosphate in its future products.
Briggs & Stratton’s SimpliPHI Energy Storage System uses lithium-ferro-phosphate chemistry, which does not use cobalt, a metal associated with health hazards, and a key culprit in battery fires. And a new Canadian company, Salient Energy, developed a zinc-ion battery, which is a water-based chemistry that the company says eliminates the risk of fire, making the batteries more applicable for residential energy storage.
The umbrellas affected by the recall are made in China by SunVilla and sold at Costco in the United States and Canada. Consumers can return them to any Costco Warehouse for a full refund. SunVilla and Costco are also attempting to contact known purchasers.

In early 2020, the R&D center of Spain's Tecnalia, the University of Eindhoven, and France's Engie announced the creation of an industrial startup, H2SITE, in Biscay, Spain, to promote the on-site production of high-quality green hydrogen.
One hurdle to the widespread adoption of hydrogen is the difficulty of transporting it over long distances. By contrast, ammonia is a molecule with a very high hydrogen density that is easy to transport and store on-site. And H2SITE's technology could allow ammonia to be turned into hydrogen with high levels of efficiency.
The Tyseley Ammonia to Green Hydrogen initiative was led by H2SITE in Birmingham, England. Its objective is to create the most efficient ammonia-to-hydrogen conversion unit in the world. The pilot plant will produce 200 kg of hydrogen per day to feed an existing hydrogen refueling station.
The initiative, financed with €7.8 million ($8.2 million) from the UK Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, is part of a commitment to reach a hydrogen production capacity of up to 10 GW in 2030. Projections show that hydrogen will represent 35% of the total energy consumption of the United Kingdom by 2050.

“The long-term research goal of the KAUST's KPV-LAB is to develop a realistic high-efficiency photovoltaic solution for sunny and hot climates and our device is in line with this goal,” researcher Erkan Aydin told pv magazine.
The cell has a p-i-n structure and relies on an interlayer that provided high transparency, high stability, and good thickness control.
“We demonstrated that the charge transport and recombination interfaces could be carefully tuned with MgFx interlayers, enabling a certified efficiency of 29.3%,” the scientists said.
Currently, the most powerful perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell is a 29.8% device that was recently developed by scientists at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) in Germany.
The Saudi scientists fabricated the cell with a sub-cell based on crystalline silicon wafers with double-side texture, which they say reduces front reflection while improving light trapping. They also placed the MgFx interlayer at the electron-selective top contact.
They used buckminsterfullerene, a molecule which is also known as C60, for the fabrication of the HTL, and added a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) layer and an indium tin oxide (IZO) top contact. The Sno2 layer acts as a buffer against damage from the sputtering of the IZO top contact. This IZO-perovskite structure, according to the researchers, supported a very slow carrier decay process and improved charge extraction.
The scientists tested an encapsulated solar cell built with this architecture at the CalLab of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) in Germany. The device achieved a steady-state power conversion efficiency of 29.3% and a reverse-scan efficiency of 29.4%. It also achieved an open-circuit voltage of 1.85 V, a short-circuit current of 19.8 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 77.9%.
“The device statistics corroborated that the power conversion efficiency improvement was mainly the result of enhanced open-circuit voltage and fill factor,” they explained.
The cell went through damp-heat testing and was able to retain 95.4% of its initial efficiency after 1,000 hours.
“The open-circuit voltage even improved slightly, indicating that the perovskite itself and the interfacial layers were sufficiently tolerant to thermal stress,” the research team said.
The academics presented the cell in “Efficient and stable perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells through contact displacement by MgFx,” which was recently published in Science.
“Looking forward, our overall goal is to enhance the efficiency and stability as much as possible and drive down the [levelized cost of electricity] below the current mainstream crystalline silicon solar cells,” Aydin said.
In December 2021, the same research group achieved a power conversion efficiency of 28.2% for a tandem solar cell with an area of around 1 square centimeters, based on an n-i-p perovskite stacked on top of a silicon heterojunction. The performance was achieved through a novel strategy to suppress halide segregation and reduce nonradiative recombination loss. The method involves the use of carbazole, a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic molecule, as an additive for the cell perovskite precursor.

Sunlit Sea, a Trondheim-based startup that was established in 2019, has patented a design that consists of two aluminum sheets welded together with a solar panel laminated on top. It claims the prefabricated nature of its floating solar system drives down cost for customers and reduces the environmental impact on installation sites.
The company's website states that the startup's first prototype was developed in 2020 and a fifth iteration was deployed in an “exposed location” in 2022. A timeline on the Sunlit Sea website indicates that the company plans to install its first commercial project, a 936 kWp system, at some point this year.
The floats are supplied in strings and are unfolded on site before being towed out by boat and connected to host larger solar modules. The panels have a peak generation capacity of 537 W each, according to Sunlit Sea. It claims that its product has a minimum guaranteed lifetime of 25 years.
“Sunlit Sea's solution offers excellent cooling, reduced panel degradation, and rapid deployment due to pre-fabrication,” said Sunlit Sea CEO Per Lindberg.
Sunlit Sea said it works closely with the University of Oslo, Norwegian testing facility Stadt Towing Tank, and the Institute for Energy Technology, which started life as Norway's nuclear research entity.
DNV said global floating solar installations will rise from 3 GWp at present to between 20 GW and 25 GW within this decade.

“The generator has passed key tests to directly run 100% hydrogen and 100% ammonia fuels at high efficiencies,” said company spokesperson Maria Amundson. “It may be used to displace intensive diesel generators at data centers, hospitals, grocery stores, and in behind-the-meter applications as well as in large grids and microgrids.”
The company says the linear generator can ramp up and down quickly via solar. It also has the ability to dynamically switch between different kinds of fuels.
In order to make the generator work with hydrogen and ammonia, the company created a new design incorporating new power electronics.
“Our generator automatically adapts to the composition of incoming fuels and responds accordingly with precise control of the reaction to maximize efficiency,” said Amundson.
Mainspring Energy offers the solution in 230 kW packages with two linear generator cores. It claims the generators can be linked with similar devices to reach a capacity of up to 15 MW.
“Projects greater than 1.5 MW can be optimally designed with the use of external inverters,” it sad. Each generator measures 20.5 meters x 8.5 meters x 9.5 meters, weighs 20 tons, and can operate at temperatures ranging from -20 C to 50 C.

The generator, like its previous version running on natural gas or biogas, uses a low-temperature reaction of air and fuel to drive magnets through copper coils to produce electricity. The electrically controlled linear motion of oscillators embedded in the system compresses the fuel and air mixture until the mixture reacts uniformly and instantaneously without a flame or burning.
This reaction drives the two oscillators carrying magnets through copper coils and produces electricity through linear motion. Outer springs are then compressed to return the oscillators for the next cycle.

That about wraps us up for day one of pv magazine‘s Roundtables Europe event, although there's plenty of group sessions going ahead as we speak.
Feel free to join in, otherwise, join us tomorrow for more solar fun and japes!
Realistic deployment of solar modules on car bodyshapes – and panels for more heavy-duty vehicles – can extend range, removing the potential frustration of trying to find the nearest charging station, as well as making for a more enjoyable journey thanks to solar-powered air con.
No one's asked Lightyear solar engineer Emanuele Cornagliotti how many of the company's employees will be able to afford its first model, mind…
#RTEU22
Now it's time for the session devoted to whatever the clean-energy equivalent of petrol-heads are.
Jonathan Gifford and electric vehicle industry experts will peer into the future to find out what the cars of tomorrow (or even today) might look like, and the services they'll be able to offer us.
If you're just dropping in for our afternoon session, Nicola Rossi, of Italian energy company Enel, and Norsun's Carsten Rohr have been talking us through existing plans to get solar production lines on the ground in Europe.
Now though, we're on another short break before we return with the PV on wheels session, so get networking!
#RTEU22
Representatives from German solar manufacturing equipment suppliers Von Ardenne and Isra Vision are discussing what sort of tech will form the basis of European-made solar panels in the years ahead.
Von Ardenne's Sebastian Gatz explained European manufacturers will find it difficult to compete with Asian rivals because they will lack the 400 GW of annual silicon wafer production capacity available in China; because of the cost of Perc cell production, which Chinese manufacturers have screwed down through big economies of scale; and because Perc cells and modules are already almost at their theoretical efficiency limits.
Therefore, he added, “n-type technology is entering the game.”
Asked by pv magazine‘s Jonathan Gifford which n-type technology will prevail in Europe, heterojunction (HJT) or TopCon (tunnel oxide, passivated contact), Gatz pointed out the former has the lower carbon footprint.
Solar star Walburga Hemetsberger, of trade body SolarPower Europe, is fleshing out how the industry lobby group can help the EU get 20 GW of annual solar manufacturing capacity installed across the bloc by 2025.

But there's plenty going on at our Roundtables event in case you're at a loose end until the 2pm restart. Why not have a look and explore the links below the broadcast screen.
Ciao for now!
Worryingly, for people like me who haven't worked out how to switch on Netflix from their TV remote yet, we're now into territory such as real-time energy consumption and pricing and houses crammed full with smart appliances and such.
Jaron Schaechter, from Israeli inverter maker and energy storage business SolarEdge, has just predicted the mobility revolution is expected to bring vehicle-to-home deployment first of all, with the far more complex business of harnessing electric cars for grid back-up to arrive further down the line.
We are into our third session of the day, entitled How to decarbonize homes today, and Insan Boy, of Chinese PV manufacturer Seraphim Solar has been offering us an insight into the technological trends we can expect from module manufacturers in the months and years ahead.
What are they? Sign up here and join the event!
#RTEU22
Now there'll be a short break, indicated on screen by this charming elevator music, for you to get involved in our networking sessions before we head into the next event: How to decarbonize homes today.
“Manufacturers will consider sustainability quite carefully in their future production,” said University of New South Wales (UNSW) Sydney professor Alison Lennon.
That's thanks to the looming threat of legislation such as taxes on carbon content, whether applied directly at source or by export markets, such as the EU and its plan for a catchily-titled Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, or Cbam.
Professor Lennon was discussing the huge amount of silver that would be required to hit global new solar estimates, using current panel designs.
As Ines Monroy, of German energy company Steag pointed out, small measures – such as reducing the size of solar panel frames – can have big impacts.
Trina's Adele Zhao has been illustrating how the Chinese solar giant is delivering on the ESG promises made in its corporate documents.
Having shipped more than 100 GW of solar modules to date, and developed more than 5.5 GW of utility scale solar plants, the photovoltaic panel manufacturing process used by the company could have a huge environmental impact.
Adele showed us the figures to illustrate how the business is trying to bear down on that issue, with Trina claiming it reduced its natural gas consumption per megawatt of solar panel generation capacity manufactured by 50.92% from 2020 to 2021. For the same period, water consumption per megawatt also fell, by 46.19%.
Handily, the means Trina is also saving on its utility bills, neatly displaying the commercial rationale for effective ESG policies.
Becky Beetz has opened our second session of the day, which will consider what truly environmental, social and governance policies can do to improve solar industry standards.
Are they a credible method of improve the industry's practices or just a load more greenwash?
#RTEU22
Meyer Burger's Moritz Borgmann has pointed out the irony of ramping up solar for European energy security motives by sourcing it from China.
“How do we get from today, where we have basically zero PV industry,” asked Borgmann, who acknowledged his own employer is encompassed by that underwhelming assessment, “… to a fully developed, world scale PV industry, including all the suppliers and all the materials that it requires?”
And that's not just silicon feedstock, he pointed out, but “also the [backsheet] films, the cables, the junction boxes etc.”
Pablo Collado, of Spanish power company Iberdrola, has hailed the success of the European Union's attempts to streamline the permitting of solar parks but warned: “I don't know if we have time for a formal [EU] process, I think we need something in between … and, in parallel, to work with Brussels.”
While the rush to roll out solar at record-breaking pace is completely understandable, Meyer Burger's Moritz Borgmann has emphasized we also need to think about where those panels are manufactured – and how.
Michael Fuhs and Jonathan Gifford are getting us under way in the studio.
We've learned German state secretary for economic affairs and Oliver Krischer cannot attend today, so that's a climate politician failing to deliver – who'd have thought?
This year, pv magazine‘s European Roundtables will focus on the role of decarbonization right throughout the European continent and economy. More than 60 speakers will join us across two days and 10 sessions to address key topics including meeting ESG criteria by raising solar manufacturing standards, solar electric vehicles, novel solar applications, and high efficiency PV cell and module manufacturing concepts.

Hanwha has issued a press release detailing its appeal against a decision made by the interim relief judge of the Tribunal judiciaire de Paris on June 7. The judge ordered the withdrawal of a patent dispute-related evidentiary seizure made at Hanwha’s request in February 2021 at the premises of a Longi distributor in France.
Hanwha said it had appealed the decision in the Court of Appeal of Paris. It also rejected allegations made by Longi, and reported by pv magazine, that it had “purposely misled” the French court and had sought to “obtain highly confidential, sensitive information from its competitor.”
Hanwha claimed that it did not intentionally mislead the court.
“Hanwha believes that it had disclosed all relevant information to the tribunal when it requested an evidentiary seizure in February 2021,” it said in a statement. “After the evidentiary seizure took place at the premises of a Longi distributor in France, Hanwha cooperated in good faith with the Longi distributor and redacted information deemed confidential from the seized documents.”
Hanwha also cast doubt on another claim by Longi, reported by pv magazine, that the recent French court ruling could affect a separate lawsuit between the two parties in the Netherlands. Longi Solar has yet to comment on the matter.

The team of 14 partners and five EU countries is working to integrate a new heat and power plant (CHP) primary fueled by forestry residues, with the addition of a hydrogen production-storage-consumption system. 
The European consortium aims to launch the first plant’s commercial operation in 2030. It is exploring two sizes. The small one would have 50 MW of fuel input, 25 MWh of electricity, and a hydrogen capacity of 34 MW, or 960 kg/hour. The biggest facility could reach 300 MW of fuel input, 150 MWh of electricity, and a hydrogen capacity of 192 MW, or 5,760 kg/hour.
The plant could use forestry, agricultural and demolition waste streams to produce power, heat, and hydrogen. The latter could then be stored for days or weeks, whereas the carbon dioxide could be permanently removed. Energy prices, hydrogen prices, and demand for heat will be the three main factors defining a plant’s operating mode.
“Bio-FlexGen plants don’t necessarily have to be close to wind and solar installations. But they should be in the region. It should be suitable to have these plants in the same electricity grid area,” Henrik Båge, the CEO of Stockholm-based Phoenix BioPower, told pv magazine.
Båge said the plants will be distributed. They will be close to large renewable facilities, as well as large consumers of syngas and hydrogen, like steel producers and refineries. Low-carbon steel initiatives in Sweden are expected to require large quantities of electricity, amounting to around 50% of the country’s current electricity consumption.
“Bio-FlexGen can supply electricity, but also hydrogen from forest waste streams. We can decouple the price of hydrogen from the price of electricity to a very large extent, by using biomass that comes at a very stable cost and flow, as it is a waste from the Swedish and Finnish forestry industry,” said Båge.
The project provides hourly, daily and seasonal flexibility. Stored hydrogen from the plant’s storage or hydrogen brought through an external pipeline can be used to start the gas turbine-based power generation within an hour when the power is needed quickly.
The plant can adapt the biomass feedstock to power consumption needs within two hours to provide daily flexibility. Seasonal flexibility relies on the fact that the plant can produce power and heat when the heat demand and electricity prices are high, while producing hydrogen and syngas in summer. 
The plants could also participate in the ancillary services market, said Båge, adding that this technology became even more relevant after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, given the industry’s need to replace Russian gas while refraining from coal consumption increases.
“In the EU and the UK, there is enough biomass to produce more than double the electricity that produced from Russian gas in the EU,” said Båge.

Alion Energy’s single-axis tracker racking product was originally designed to be deployed in regions where heavy installation equipment was more challenging to access, but labor might be more available.
One aspect of this design philosophy is that the system is light and can be easily carried and assembled, and doesn’t require metal pilings to be driven deep into the ground. And interestingly, this carries over to commercial rooftops.
Mark Kingsley, Alion Energy CEO, said in a post on LinkedIn that a commercial real estate group had installed a standard rooftop, 10-degree fixed tilt monofacial solar array, as well as a competing Alion Energy system.
The results were as expected – 37.5% greater generation on a per watt basis from the single-axis tracker, on a pristine white thermoplastic roof versus standard modules. Of course, the real breakthrough is that they were able to get single-axis trackers installed on a commercial rooftop at all.
The rooftop in their example has a lot of skylights, and the overall structure is not facing due south. In this configuration, Alion Energy suggests that it can fit 4.55 MW of modules on the Maryland structure with a standard 10-degree installation. This system is projected to generate 1.34 kWh per watt each year.
 
Alion has designed a system that is 5.4 MW – a full 18% increase in wattage due to systems ability to be installed directly over skylights without needing the standard setback. Additionally, this hardware is projected to generate 1.54 kWh per watt installed per year.
In this case, that works out to 37% more electricity from the same rooftop. And when the trackers are directly attached to the roof – a 2.15 pounds per square foot dead load. Add in one Alion’s customized robotic cleaners, and the company says the levelized cost of electricity from the system falls to 4.67¢/kWh and generates 40% more electricity than a standard rooftop solar install.
 
And while this rooftop was selected to show off their hardware, it’s still an interesting best case scenario for us to consider.
