From 2026, the terminal will import green ammonia from Saudi Arabia. Air Products will produce the ammonia and distribute it to end users in Germany, mostly for conversion into hydrogen. “[This] is a strong signal for the entire hydrogen market in Germany and Europe,” said Robert Habeck, the federal minister of economics and climate protection. The terminal will be built at Mabanaft's existing tank terminal at the Hamburg port.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said in its latest report that several of the G-7 leading industrial nations support hydrogen for light-duty fuel cell vehicles, power generation, and residential heating. “Despite hydrogen's great potential, it must be kept in mind that its production, transport and conversion require energy, as well as significant investment,” IRENA said. “Indiscriminate use of hydrogen could therefore slow down the energy transition.” It added that governments should set clear priorities to avoid waste. It said those priorities include existing hydrogen applications, basic chemicals, primary steel production, shipping, and aviation.
Masdar and its consortium partners have signed a framework agreement with several Egyptian state-backed organizations to develop a 2 GW green hydrogen project in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. They are targeting 4 GW of electrolyzer capacity and 480,000 tons of green hydrogen output by 2030. Egypt also signed a second agreement with AMEA Power to deploy a 1 GW green hydrogen project, as well as several other agreements, bringing the total value of its plans to $85 billion. Separately, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said it would lend $80 million to develop Egypt's first green hydrogen facility.
Ballard Power has signed a purchase order with repeat customer Solaris Bus & Coach for 25 hydrogen fuel cell engines. The 70 kW fuel cells will be installed in 12 Solaris Urbino hydrogen buses and will be sent to Polish public transport operator MPK Poznań in the second half of 2023, said Vancouver-based Ballard Power. 
The California Air Resources Board has updated its climate action proposal, which supports hydrogen as a mitigation tool. Teresa Cooke, the executive director at the California Hydrogen Coalition, said that hydrogen would be used in fuel cells for zero-emission transportation, transit, goods movement, industrial activities, and power.
The European Investment Bank has signed a joint declaration with Namibia for a potential loan of up to €500 million ($517.5 million) to finance renewable hydrogen and renewable energy investments.

Singapore-based Sembcorp Industries (Sembcorp) has agreed to acquire Mumbai-based renewables producer Vector Green Energy for SGD 474 million ($345 million). Its wholly owned Sembcorp Green Infra subsidiary has signed an agreement with India Infrastructure Fund II, a fund managed by Global Infrastructure Partners India, to acquire a 100% stake in Vector Green Energy.
Vector Green is a private-sector power producer with a renewables portfolio of 583 MW across 13 Indian states. The portfolio includes 495 MW of solar capacity and 24 MW of wind capacity in operation, with 64 MW of solar projects under development. With the acquisition of Vector Green’s assets, Sembcorp’s gross renewables portfolio in India will total 3 GW, including 1 GW of solar assets and 2 GW of wind assets.
“Sembcorp remains committed to growing its renewables portfolio in India, one of the fastest growing renewables markets in the world,” said Wong Kim Yin, group president and CEO of Sembcorp Industries. “This acquisition is aligned with the Group’s brown to green transformation strategy. With the completion of this acquisition, Sembcorp’s gross renewable energy capacity will increase to 8.5 GW, pushing us closer towards our 2025 target of 10 GW.”
Sembcorp will fund the acquisition through internal cash resources and external borrowings. The acquisition is expected to complete by the first quarter of 2023.
“This acquisition brings significant utility-scale solar capacity to our India business, which will complement our existing wind portfolio,” said Vipul Tuli, CEO of South Asia for Sembcorp Industries. “It also broadens and deepens our renewable energy capabilities and presence across states in India, and positions us well for further green growth in the country.”

The described their findings in “Lightweight and flexible Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar minimodules: toward 20% photovoltaic efficiency and beyond,” which was recently published in Flexible Electronics. They said that their work was largely limited to panels that can be used on rooftops where severe weight restrictions are applied. However, they also used rooftops with curved surfaces and surfaces on which conventional crystalline silicon (c-Si) panels cannot be used.
“Among thin-film photovoltaic technologies, CIGS-based solar cells are an attractive option owing to their advantages of relatively high energy conversion efficiency, long-term stability, relatively short energy payback time, and small carbon footprint of products,” the scientists said.
It will be crucial to improve the control of alkali metal doping on the CIGS film, in order to help the CIGS solar module technology reach an efficiency of over 20% at the module level. They said this depends on the alkali metal species and the doping methods and processes.
“In addition to alkali-metal doping, silver (Ag)- and sulfur (S)-alloying for the modification and control of the energy band structure in CIGS devices, improvement in the bulk crystal quality, and surface and back interface modification are the current topics of interest in the CIGS community,” the scientists explained, noting that these techniques could help to increase the average efficiency of CIGS flexible panels from around 18.5% at present to more than 20%.
The scientists said the suppression of carrier recombination at the interface and in the bulk of a CIGS cell is one of the factors that must be improved to obtain higher efficiency. They identified scribed edges of CIGS photoabsorbers as one of the possible causes leading to recombination issues.
“Nevertheless, to date, there have been only a few discussions on the effect of mechanically scribed edges on photovoltaic performance,” they said. “Therefore, in this section, the effect of mechanical scribing (MS), which has been used as a standard technique, on photovoltaic performance is comparatively studied with photolithographically formed edges.”
The review also investigates the variations in CIGS performance with light intensity and suggests the usefulness of CIGS photovoltaic devices under low illumination conditions.
“For further development, the improvement of CIGS single-cell performance is essential,” they concluded. “Approaches based on material science and device physics, including modification of surface and interface, and bulk crystal quality by alloying with Ag or S, or other elements as well as doping control of alkali metals, are expected to bring further progress in CIGS photovoltaics.”

The consortium has secured €7.8 million in funding from the Dutch government.
The installation will feature six interconnected platforms mounted on synthetic anchors. It will be built to withstand extreme offshore conditions. The pilot project is expected to demonstrate that offshore floating solar can be safely installed between offshore wind turbines.
SolarDuck will design a “pop-up” assembly line for in-situ construction of future commercial-seized Merganser units. These will have a capacity of at least 5 MW and fit in containers for efficient transport.
The research institutes will test the solar platform and electrical systems for corrosion resistance, UV degradation of the synthetic anchor, and marine growth on the floaters. The group will also conduct research on the social acceptance of offshore floating solar.
“When the project delivers the expected results, it can easily be upgraded to gigawatt scale, making it ideal for coastal (mega)cities’ energy needs,” the consortium said in a statement, noting that he project will be compeleted by the end of 2024.
“We are very proud to have the DEI+ subsidy on board to build a scalable floating solar energy solution,” said Don Hoogendoorn, the CTO of SolarDuck. “Together, we’ll make this project successful and make sustainable offshore solar energy commercially viable much faster.”
SolarDuck was recently selected to build another 5 MW offshore floating solar project in the North Sea.

Several companies have tried to deploy solar modules along cycling paths over the past few years. However, the feasibility and economic viability of solar roads remain controversial. The problem is that the modules in recent projects were installed on the pavement, exposing them to excessive mechanical stress from bicycles and pedestrians.
With this in mind, German system integrator Badenova has decided to install the solar panels above the cycling paths, on a roof-like structure. It has deployed a total of 912 glass-glass modules over a 300-meter section of a cycling path. The municipal government provided the land and supported the project with funds from its climate-protection fund.
The 282.7 kW solar system, mounted on 38 galvanized steel roof segments, will generate around 280,000 kWh of electricity per year. The leaseholder of the system is the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems.
The project uses solar modules from German manufacturer Solarwatt. Together with Clickcon's newly developed “Click Plain Pro” mounting system, the modules form a closed rooftop structure. Fraunhofer ISE said it wants to use the electricity generated by the pilot project for its laboratories.

Comunidad de Regantes de Águilas, a Spanish irrigation community, recently completed the installation of a floating PV plant on one of its irrigation ponds in the municipality of Águilas, in the southern Spanish region of Murcia.
The 786 kW floating array features 4,256 Isifloating 4.0 floats from Isigenere. The floating structures support 1,728  solar panels, each with a nominal power of 455 W.
Due to the dimensions of the pond, a flexible joint has also been designed along the entire floating platform. In addition, the PV installation is directly attached to the outer slopes of the pond via aluminum profile supports. This installation, together with the floating one, provides electricity to the pumps to lift the pond and part of the desalination plant.
The installation is the second floating PV project to support water pumping in Spain. In September, the Sur-Andévalo Irrigation Community in the southern province of Huelva completed the installation of a 1.6 MW floating solar plant for this purpose. The system, which was built on a pond in the municipality of Cartaya, features floats provided by Isigenere and 3,584 solar panels, each with a rated power of 450 W.
In March, the Spanish government submitted a royal decree to regulate the installation of floating PV plants. According to its estimates, around 7.5 GW of floating solar capacity could be deployed on public bodies of water.

Modeling specialist Vibrant Clean Energy (VCE) has proposed a transmission “overlay” for the contiguous United States, with about 210 underground high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines, 70 nodes, and underwater lines along nearly the entire coastline. HVDC transmission can deliver power over long distances more efficiently than alternating current (AC) transmission.
“This is the system built in our zero2050usa study,” said VCE CEO Christopher Clack on LinkedIn, adding that a report describing the study will “come soon.” The study modeled a net-zero emissions economy for the contiguous United States, including an HVDC “macrogrid” built by 2025.
In the least-cost scenario, installed solar capacity would exceed 830 GW by 2050, while wind capacity would exceed 1130 GW, with onshore wind predominating. VCE modeled 10 scenarios using its WIS:dom-P model.
Previous solar and wind capacity projections from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s “Interconnection Seams Study” showed that HVDC could economically transmit solar power from sunnier regions to less sunny regions. However, it added that HVDC transmission would not result in more solar overall. Rather, it could lead to more solar development in sunnier regions but less solar development in other regions, leaving the total approximately unchanged.
VCE’s modeled transmission system would cost $400 billion if financed over 30 years at a 3% interest rate. That translates to a cost of $7.50/MWh, which would enable reduced electricity costs of $25/MWh. It would save 4.5 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. At an 8% interest rate, it would cost $700 billion. Costs were based on cost numbers from “Tier 1” vendors and construction companies likely to do the work, with some “padding” because the numbers “might be a little optimistic,” Clack said.
The US Department of Energy (DoE) is conducting a National Transmission Needs Study, and will release the draft 2023 study by year end for comment and feedback. To date, the consultation draft has been presented to Native American tribes. The DoE has identified transmission along highways and other rights of way as a research and development opportunity.
The proposed SOO Green HVDC Link transmission project will transmit wind power from Iowa eastward. It has been gaining investors and partners for a 349-mile, 2.1 GW transmission line, largely along railroad rights-of-way and entirely underground.

Equis Development has committed to invest $1.27 billion to develop the Melbourne Renewable Energy Hub (MREH) north of Melbourne in the state of Victoria after acquiring the battery energy storage project from Australian renewables developer Syncline Energy.
The project, previously known as the Melton Renewable Energy Hub, was first unveiled in August 2021 by Melbourne-based Syncline. The original design featured a 600 MW/2,400 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) backed by a 12.5 MWp solar farm to supply the battery’s ancillary cooling loads and ensure low-cost, “net-zero” operations. But Equis, which assumed full control of the project earlier this year, has since rebranded and resized the big battery.
The MREH, to be built on a 90-hectare site just 25 kilometers northwest of Melbourne, has been boosted to include a 1,200 MWh battery system, while the storage capacity will remain at 2.4 GWh. The massive facility will connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via the state’s main 500 kV transmission link and will collect excess energy, store it, and then release it back into the grid to satisfy demand.
Equis said it is expected the battery will be capable of stabilising about 1.6 GW of solar power or 1.2 GW of wind generation.
“Fully developed, MREH will be … the largest such system in Australia and Asia,” the company said. “MREH is Australia’s only BESS above 200 MW in capacity that connects to the NEM’s high-voltage 500 kV transmission system, allowing a volume of electricity to be rapidly dispatched unmatched by other battery storage systems.”
The MREH, which has received all necessary planning approvals after being fast-tracked by the Victorian government as a “project of state significance,” will be rolled out in two 600 MW stages, with construction of the first phase scheduled to begin in early 2023 with operations anticipated to commence in 2024.
The battery project will utilize lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry batteries provided by Finnish technology group Wartsila.
Equis said the MREH had been “uniquely developed” with six separate 200 MW points of connection to the NEM, allowing the battery to satisfy different uses and grid responses simultaneously. The company said the project has been designed with innovative inverter technology to support the transmission grid's voltage and frequency and replace “system inertia” that is lost when coal and gas-fired power stations retire over the next decade.
“The scale and uniqueness of MREH’s approvals and development mean it will be capable of providing both short and long-hour storage and response services catering to the changing demands of the National Electricity Market,” Equis Managing Director David Russell said.
Equis anticipates the project will also facilitate the development of a large-scale battery recycling hub and hydrogen production facility.
Syncline, which is to remain involved with the project until major construction starts, said the battery is ideally sited because of its proximity to the main 500 kV line. It expects the positioning to allow it to support Victoria’s Murray River, Western Victoria and South Victoria renewable energy zones.
“Four years ago, Syncline combed Victoria for the ideal location to build a large-scale grid storage battery which would partially replace the state’s ageing fleet of coal generation plants,” Syncline Managing Director Phil Galloway said. “We needed enough space to operate safely and to minimise the impact on the community. It also had to be at the metropolitan load centre, to ensure that we could improve the reliability and resilience of the grid and materially support regional wind and solar energy.
“Finally, we had to connect at 500 kV to deliver the volume of energy that is required when Australia’s large thermal generators retire over the next 10 years. MREH was the ideal location.”
The MREH project is just one of 39 renewable energy, battery storage, and waste infrastructure projects worth more than $4.4 billion that Equis, which is backed by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, is currently developing in Australia. While the MREH is the biggest of its battery projects, Equis has also announced plans to develop a 300MW/1,200MWh battery near Tamworth in New South Wales, a 200 MW/800 MWh energy storage system near Brinkworth in South Australia, and two battery projects totaling 250 MW in Queensland.

Longi Green Energy, the world’s largest solar panel producer, has been instrumental in driving solar to become the “cheapest energy in history,” according to the International Energy Agency. The company is now joining a wide field of competitors as it sets its sights on hydrogen electrolyzers.
Looking at the confluence of technological breakthroughs and rapidly growing investments in hydrogen, one cannot help but wonder if the price of the world’s lightest energy storage medium might soon collapse, much like the price of solar cells. BloombergNEF’s hydrogen market outlook recently published a chart showing what looks to be the beginning of a dramatic S-curve. Remember – everyone underestimates the rate of change.

Longi expects to have 85 GW of solar module assembly capacity built by the end of the year.  pv magazine USA briefly conversed with Longi at RE+, where we asked the company about their green hydrogen plans.
The company has launched three electrolyzer models. At the company’s booth it was suggested that the 5 MW alkaline water electrolytic bath – the LHy-A1000 – was the most efficient of the three models. The unit generates approximately 90 kg of hydrogen per hour.
Longi stated that it hopes to expand its Wuxi manufacturing facility to 1.5 GW by the end of 2022, and to produce 5 GW to 10 GW of electrolyzers by 2025. These targets imply a growth of multiple gigawatts per year.
The company began thinking hard about hydrogen in 2018, as wind and solar prices plummeted, and renewables expanded massively across China. Since electricity comprises 60% of the cost of producing hydrogen, excess solar was thought to be the perfect partner.
Meanwhile demand for net zero industrial processes has been looming. Longi cited some of the key industries: cement, fertilizer, and oil refinement.
At its booth, pv magazine USA pried for pricing data for Longi’s electrolyzers, asking whether they were below $1,000/kW. The company replied that their products cost less than $500 per kW. Bloomberg NEF recently reported that alkaline electrolyzers produced by an unnamed Chinese manufacturer were less than one-third the price of those manufactured in the United States, at only $343/kW.
Because Longi is the largest producer of electrolyzers, it is likely to be the manufacturer of the $343 electrolyzer. However, since six companies are already producing more than 1 GW of capacity each year (per the chart, below), we’re not sure who is leading these cost reductions.
Bloomberg NEF’s analysis also predicts that we should expect an additional 30% reduction in costs due to scaling by 2025. However, some of those gains will be offset by increases to the price of labor and commodities.
This scaling process is still in its early stages, so it is still very likely that the 20% price decrease, associated with each doubling of capacity, should greatly outpace the relatively small increases to labor pricing that can be expected. External forces are playing a strong role in these developments, too. The US Inflation Reduction Act pays $3/kg for green hydrogen. And as other forces cause energy pains, like the war in Ukraine, it appears likely that manufacturers will find new markets for these components.

“The new module also meets the 2-square-meter restriction of the building authority approval in Germany,” said the manufacturer.
It can operate with a system voltage of 1,500 V and comes with a 15-year product guarantee and a 25-year performance guarantee. End power output is guaranteed to be no less than 85.28% of the nominal output power, while degradation in the first year should not exceed 2%.
