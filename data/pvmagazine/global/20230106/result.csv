https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/06/why-solar-needs-to-slim-down-on-silver/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JANUARY 6, 2023",Why solar needs to slim down on silver,"Solar cells use silver to conduct the electric charge out of the cell and into the system. Each cell produced today requires just a few milligrams of the precious metal, but this quickly adds up and plenty of recent studies have illustrated how the rapidly growing solar industry could exhaust much of the world’s known silver reserves by 2050 or even earlier.
Even before the alarm began to be raised about availability of silver, cell makers were keen to cut their consumption of it anyway, as one of the most costly materials used in solar manufacturing. New research from Australia’s UNSW, however, shows that silver reduction efforts need to ramp up significantly to avoid a supply problem, particularly with the introduction of new n-type technologies that require more silver than the PERC cells that still represent more than 80% of the market today.
The UNSW group’s latest paper, “The silver learning curve for photovoltaics and projected silver demand for net-zero emissions by 2050,” was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. It examines the impact of different PV technology pathways on silver demand.
“The results show that the current rate of reduction in silver consumption is not sufficient to avoid increasing silver demand from the PV industry and that the transition to high-efficiency technologies including TOPCon and SHJ could greatly increase silver demand, posing price and supply risks,” said the researchers.
The key conclusion is that increased investment is needed in research and development of “silver-lean” PV technologies, and recent achievements with copper plating are presented as particularly promising.
“Although plating requires a major change from existing manufacturing practices, copper plating represents a promising opportunity to accelerate the reduction of silver usage by the PV industry, while overcoming any physical constraints imposed by printing technology,” the group said.
Over the longer term, the recycling of older solar modules could provide a significant source of silver. However, further investment and research is needed here, and it may still be several decades before the volume of PV waste processed each year is enough for more than a marginal contribution of new silver.
The scientists further warn against relying on the possibility of increased silver production, noting that the most accessible silver resources have already been mined. They said that opening up new mines will likely mean digging deeper or processing lower quality ores – all of which leads to increased energy consumption.

The company originally submitted its IPO application in June 2021 and passed the SSE listing evaluation in  December of that year. The IPO was then temporarily suspended in September 2022, as Canadian Solar reportedly failed to provide required updates.
The IPO prospectus shows that Canadian Solar plans to issue 541 million shares, accounting for 15% of its total post-issuance capital stock. It expects to raise net proceeds of CNY 8.8 billion ($1.26 billion) and said it wants to invest the funds to expand its wafer, cell and module capacity. It said it also wants to invest in a new research institute in Jiaxing, Zhejiang province.
Canadian Solar is the only major Chinese PV company without a listing on a Chinese stock market. JinkoSolar, JA Solar, and Trina Solar have already moved from the New York Stock Exchange to the SSE.

Guyana’s Parliamentary Committee of Supply recently approved $1.7 billion to help Linden Electricity Co. to mitigate higher fuel prices and provide some relief to the utility’s customers.
Dillawar told Guyana’s Department of Public Information that the program would effectively free up government capital that could be “reprogrammed for the people of Linden.”
In line with Guyana’s Low Carbon Development Strategy 2030 (LCDS 2030), the GUYSOL program will invest more than $83 million in eight utility-scale solar systems in Linden, Essequibo, and Berbice. The program aims to facilitate the country’s transition to renewable energy sources and the diversification of its economy. LCDS 2030 builds on a strategy that was originally introduced in 2009, with the aim of expanding the country’s economy fivefold over a period of 10 years, while also keeping energy emissions flat.  
According to the US International Trade Administration, state-owned Guyana Power and Light loses approximately 26% of the power it generates due to inefficiencies in power grids and transmission lines, which drives the country’s push for the development of microgrids for outlying regions. Prime Minister Mark Anthony Phillips stated in 2022 that the government has budgeted $5.04 million for projects in less populated areas in the off-grid hinterlands, away from the coast.
In October, the Guyana Energy Agency announced the completion of solar PV installations at nine public buildings in the Barima-Waini region, including three schools, five health facilities, and a radio station, for a combined capacity of 69 kW. The region is a mainly forested highland with a low population density, and that makes it a suitable target for renewable energy microgrids.

Damodar Valley Corp. (DVC) has identified 2 GW of floating solar potential across reservoirs at its Maithon, Panchet, Tilaiya and Konar dams in the Indian state of Jharkhand.
The state-owned company has sought approval from India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy to set up the capacity under the Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Parks (UMREPP) scheme. DVC has already secured approval for 990 MW of 2 GW from the ministry. It will soon tender some of that 990 MW, according to a DVC official.
The capacity will be built across three reservoirs and will presumably be set up in a joint venture with NTPC Renewable Energy Ltd. DVC has also signed a memorandum of understanding with NTPC Renewable Energy Ltd to develop renewable energy projects on the reservoirs of its dams.

“Normally, the efficiency performance progress of solar cell development is measured as a function of time,” the scientists said. “However, what is important, is not the time that has passed, but the research effort required to achieve an efficiency improvement.”
They noted the need to quickly identify the potential of non-crystalline silicon technologies, in order to estimate the real possibility of achieving significant cost reductions. They used the cumulative number of technical publications as a proxy for R&D efforts and assumed that each new publication advanced the field in a similar way. They found that the number of researchers and the effectiveness of research, as well as time and available resources, are strictly correlated to efficiency increases.
“Our analysis suggests that the average efficiency return on effort, at least by those motivated by publishing R&D results, are very similar for halide perovskites, CdTe and CIGSe,” the scientists explained. “This implies that exponential growth vs. year is driven more by exponential growth in researchers and efforts expended than the technology being qualitatively different than these other high-efficiency polycrystalline thin film technologies.”
They also discovered that solar cell efficiency increased by 5% for every order of magnitude of published articles.
“Which means that to go from 5% to 10% efficiency one hundred publications are required, whilst to go from 10 to 15% one thousand publications are required, and so on,” they concluded.
They presented the new learning curve methodology in “Efficiency versus effort: A better way to compare best photovoltaic research cell efficiencies?,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
“While learning spillover from non-PV technologies, cross-pollination from other PV technologies, and hidden commercial effort are not accounted for by this metric, this analysis still yields useful and novel insights into PV technology trajectories,” they concluded.

CES is among the largest tech events in the world, with numerous advancements in renewable technologies such as solar this year.
Growatt, for example, unveiled two portable battery banks with LiFePO4 chemistry for off-grid use. The Vita 550 is the most portable option, featuring a 538 Wh battery capacity, 600 W AC output, and 11 outlets of various configurations that allow users to power most devices. 
The devices offer 1.6-hour AC charging speed and support up to 800 W of solar input. They can be fully charged on solar in 2.5 hours, with customizable features like adjustable lighting and optional fast and slow charging. The Watt+ feature allows the banks to extend beyond their 600 W limit and power devices up to 1,050 W. 
Growatt said the Vita 550 can power a light bulb for 15 hours or run a 70 W fan for 6.5 hours. The company said the device is durable through 3,000 charge cycles. 
For a larger, yet still portable battery bank, the Jackery Solar Generator 3000 Pro offers several features for off-grid flexibility. The devices can be charged with six SolarSaga 200 W panels, charging in three to four hours on solar and about two and a half hours with AC input. The solar cells are built with interdigitated back contact (IBC) technology to boost production on cloudy days, early mornings, and late evenings.
The battery houses 3,024 Wh of power and offers 3,000 W of AC output. It can produce a maximum of 8,500 Wh per day. The battery can operate in rugged conditions, discharging at temperatures as low as -4 F (-15.6 C).
The 3000 Pro has an updated cooling system controlled by high-precision chips and nine sensors, which Jackery said improved heat dissipation efficiency by 30%. The battery banks operate quietly below 30 decibels when charging in silent mode. They are also equipped with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to communicate with mobile devices. 
Geneverse, meanwhile, has unveiled the HomePower PRO Plus, a portable solar generator that can be converted to an on-grid generator system for home backup. The devices can be controlled through an app to perform grid services such as peak demand shaving. 
They come with 4,838 Wh of capacity, 4,400 W of rated power, and 8,800 W of surge power. The surge outlet supports up to 30 A, offering a useful alternative power source for contractors and RV travelers.
The PRO Plus is housed in a motorized “cart” for easy portability and contains 18 outlets hidden beneath sliding panels. The system features two modular Geneverse batteries that can be removed for flexible use. The product will be available in the second quarter. 
The batteries can be charge from an AC wall outlet in under two hours, or by solar in two to four hours. Geneverse also offers a Solar Pergola, a fold-out canopy that provides shade and powers the battery bank.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/06/storing-solar-power-with-compressed-air-storage-air-conditioning/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UNITED ARAB EMIRATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 6, 2023","Storing solar power with compressed air storage, air conditioning","Scientists at the University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates have developed a way to use compressed air energy storage (CAES) for cooling purposes in hot climates, where electricity demand is significantly driven by air conditioning.
“The proposed cooling system in this research stemmed from a system for compressed air energy storage,” researcher Abdul Hai Al-Alami told pv magazine. “The system operates by routing excess energy from solar PV farms to an air compressor that fills out storage tanks to high pressures at around 20 to 30 bar. Whenever energy is needed, during times of absence of solar radiation, the air is released into an air turbine that is coupled to an electric generator.”
The researchers described the system as an ancillary installation to an existing compressed air energy storage setup and said that its activity is comparable to that of a commercially available compression cooling air conditioner. It uses commercially available air sources, pre-filled nitrogen tanks with a 50 L nominal capacity and a nominal pressure of 3,000 pounds per square inch.
“Since nitrogen makes up 79% of air, the gas properties are taken for nitrogen to simulate the behavior of air,” they said.
For the charging phase, the system relies on cylinders linked to a 9-horsepower air motor that is used to convert the potential energy of the compressed air and kinetic energy in the flowing air to mechanical rotational motion. The air motor is coupled to a 1:8 ratio gearbox, which is coupled to a 3.5 kW permanent magnet electrical generator.
“To resemble the actual performance and response to loads, the generator powers two 100 W lamps, a drill of 250 W, and a vent fan of 6 W rating and a total supplied current of 1.7A,” said the scientists.
For the discharging phase, the system uses a 9.2-meter serpentine polyethylene to carry the air into pneumatic devices, the pipe is then rolled into four 40 cm concentric loops that are submerged in a 23.6-liter water bath held in a container measuring 53 cm in diameter.
The scientists said the system can produce chilled water for air conditioning purposes at a temperature of around 5 C. They also said that the energy storage process showed a 4% higher roundtrip efficiency by employing the air heating by chilling the water for air conditioning purposes.
“In hot climates, this system would fit perfectly, not only to replace battery storage, but also to provide air conditioning through the chilled water circulation,” Hai Al-Alami said. “The compressed air energy storage system also had a 26% efficiency boost, which is a great advantage. Add to this that the cooling provided by the expanding air significantly reduces the energy demand imposed by air conditioning compressors, since the only requirement is a heat exchanger to harness the cooling effect from the expansion, which although undesirable for the storage part of the system, is a great side effect of the process from an air conditioning vantage point.”
The research group presented the system in “Cooling potential for hot climates by utilizing thermal management of compressed air energy storage systems,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports.
“The proposed system is cheap and requires no special refrigerants or power intense compressors,” the scientists concluded.

The new provisions establish a standardized collection system for each of the country's major regions. It aims to ensure a waste panel recycling/reuse rate of more than 80%, in line with current EU levels, over a period of three years. The scheme also lays the foundations for the creation of a statistical system for the sector.
The scheme is designed to encourage solar module reuse before the recycling option becomes the final choice. It will also introduce certifications under the Eco-Assurance System (ECOAS) framework, which restricts the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.
The South Korean government said it expects 1,222 tons of solar module waste by 2025, 2,645 tons by 2027, 6,796 tons by 2029, and 9,632 tons by 2032. The country reached an installed solar capacity of around 22 GW at the end of December 2021. Newly installed PV capacity for 2021 was around 4.4 GW.
South Korea plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030.

Solar and storage dominated IHS Markit's latest annual report on clean-tech trends for 2022. Distributed generation (DG), which the research firm defines as PV systems below 5 MW in size, grew by an estimated 20% in 2022.
The segment continues to demonstrate strong resilience in a challenging, high-cost environment, it said. While many projects at the utility scale have been delayed or canceled over the past two years, distributed generation did not lose traction.
“This difference reflects both the DG policy push of individual markets and many consumers’ concerns over high electricity prices and the climate footprint,” said IHS Markit.
About 60% of the DG growth occurred in China and Germany, which are pursuing policies to make DG a central part of their renewables targets. Brazil is another high-profile DG market, as net-metering systems installed through 2023 remain exempt from grid charges. Conversely, the segment may recede considerably this year in the United States, as net metering is stripped from many major state markets.
“Even at higher capex levels, DG systems generate electricity that remains competitive with retail electricity prices across many markets, meaning the DG segment is less price sensitive than utility-scale PV,” said IHS Markit.
Rising capex
Despite higher-than-expected capital expenditures in 2022, a new paradigm of renewables growth emerged. Renewables are already the cheapest source of new power generation globally, and cost declines due to technology evolutions and policy advancements have triggered further capacity additions and price declines.
Solar investors have come to expect continuously lower capital expenditures, but as the technology has matured, capex has declined at a slower rate. This, combined with supply chain hurdles and rising shipping and materials costs, has led to higher-than-expected capex for solar projects in 2022.
As the penetration of renewables increases, the focus is not so much on costs, but on the value provided to systems. “In a moment of high volatility, the predictability in operating renewables is valued,” said IHS Markit. 
Investors also value investments in renewables as a way to meet climate commitments and de-risk portfolios. IHS Markit said consolidation in renewables banking and a strong push for green financing has brought down the cost of capital for renewable power projects. Recent volatility and spikes in electricity prices have improved the captured prices for renewables.
“These perceived values counterbalance the industry’s higher-than-expected capex and underpin the continued build-out of new renewables capacity,” said IHS Markit.
Supply chain woes, trade barriers, and geopolitics have been driving PV manufacturing capacity closer to the end user. IHS Markit said supply chain tightness could persist for some time, but there have been some positive developments: 
Announcements of new ingot, wafer, cell, and module capacity in India, the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia will continue in 2023, as the supply chain grows and adapts to the new international trade environment.
