According to the consultancy, global trade and diversified transport infrastructure are crucial for unlocking the full potential of the green hydrogen market. Deloitte's outlook suggests that by 2050, major regions engaging in global trade could generate over $280 billion in annual export revenues. In 2030, Asia is expected to capture 55% of the market, driven by soaring demand in China, India, and Indonesia. The report notes the need for more than $9 trillion of cumulative investments in the global clean hydrogen supply chain to achieve net-zero compliance by 2050. It also says that clean hydrogen presents a significant sustainable growth opportunity for developing countries.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen met with Namibia's President Hage Geingob to discuss energy cooperation. The purpose of their visit is to explore opportunities for signing energy agreements with Namibia, particularly in relation to the country's multibillion-dollar green hydrogen projects. Rutte noted their intention to enhance cooperation on green hydrogen, accompanied by companies and knowledge institutions. Additionally, the two European leaders are visiting South Africa and Morocco to engage in discussions about hydrogen collaboration. In May, Namibia initiated the feasibility stage of the green hydrogen project through an agreement with Hyphen Hydrogen Energy.
University of Alberta researchers have studied small modular nuclear reactor power plants (SMNRPPs) and their influence on hydrogen supply costs. Their findings indicate that in electricity markets with high fossil fuel-dependence, hydrogen supply costs can range from CAD 1.77/kg ($1.34/kg) to CAD 3.36/kg, while in low fossil fuel-dependence markets, the range is estimated to be CAD 2.11/kg to CAD 2.77/kg. Their analysis, outlined in the paper “Assessing the cost competitiveness of electrolytic hydrogen production from small modular nuclear reactor-based power plants: A price-following perspective,” involved combining economic dispatch and leveled cost analysis models. The researchers also considered the adaptability of SMNRPPs to adjust power output based on fluctuating electricity market prices. They emphasized that the SMNRPP-electrolysis system proves more cost-effective than fossil fuel-based hydrogen production at a capital cost decrease of CAD 4,700/kW, with the capital cost accounting for 75% of the hydrogen supply cost variance. The study was published in Applied Energy
Iqony Energies has announced its intention to construct a 53 MW electrolysis plant in Saarland, Germany. The company aims to facilitate the decarbonization of industries in the region, including the steel industry and the mobility sector. Anke Langner, managing director of Iqony Energies, said that waiting for a sufficiently efficient European hydrogen pipeline network could hinder the industry's rapid adoption of hydrogen.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/20/iea-pvps-releases-global-benchmark-for-solar-irradiance-data/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JUNE 20, 2023",IEA-PVPS releases global benchmark for solar irradiance data,"Solar irradiance plays a crucial role in managing PV assets throughout the world. Numerous institutional and commercial providers offer modeled solar irradiance data, making it challenging for users to determine the most suitable providers for their specific applications and locations.
Now, IEA-PVPS Task 16 has produced a worldwide benchmark of modeled solar irradiance data to help the solar industry to make better-informed decisions about solar resource assessments.
The study gives a point of reference for model-derived direct normal irradiance (DNI) and global horizontal irradiance (GHI) data, using 129 high-quality ground-based radiation measurement stations across the globe from 2015 to 2020. It then compares DNI and GHI estimates from 10 solar radiation datasets, either public-domain or commercial, against this reference point. The datasets are ACCESSG3, DWDSARAH, CAMS v3.2, KNMISEVIRI, CAMS pre-v4, METEOTEST, CERES, NSRDBGOES, CSIROHIMAWARI, and Solargis.
The comparison is conducted at hourly temporal resolution and the performance of the modeled information is analyzed with respect to different regions and climate zones.
IEA-PVPS says the quality of the reference database is assured by selecting data based on a “comprehensive set of best practices and newly implemented quality-control procedures. These include automatic and manual data quality-control tests carried out by a team of experts for all stations and result in flags describing the quality for each time stamp.” Of the total 129 stations, 31 are in Africa, 31 in Asia, 27 in North America, 20 in Europe, 13 in Australia, five in South America, and two in Antarctica. The report calculates the mean bias deviation, root mean square deviation, and standard deviation between the benchmark and each station across the 2015-20 period.
“The benchmark results have shown noticeable deviations in performance between the various modeled data sets,” the report says. “In particular, it was found that the most appropriate data set actually depends on both site and climate or continent of interest. Some stations are especially challenging for some models, as evidenced by the high deviations observed for several data sets in difficult environments (e.g., high mountains or coastal areas).”
The report showed that the model errors and the differences between the various modeled data sets are much higher for DNI than for GHI, because of the former’s higher sensitivity to aerosols, clouds, and elevation, among other factors.
As for dataset-specific results, the study shows that CERES had significantly higher deviations than all other satellite-derived datasets, likely due to its coarser resolution. Solargis showed the lowest average deviation metrics and was also the best performer at many individual stations, according to IEA-PVPS.
“From a methodological standpoint, this benchmark underlined the importance of the reference data quality. Without a stringent quality control procedure, no real validation can be done, with the risk of obtaining invalid results,” the researchers concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/20/greece-launches-1-gw-storage-tender/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,GREECE",ILIAS TSAGAS,"JUNE 20, 2023",Greece launches 1 GW storage tender,"RAAEY – Greece's newly formed regulatory authority for waste, energy, and water – has revealed that the country will allocate 1 GW of new energy storage capacity. The program consists of three separate auctions, with capacities of 400 MW, 300 MW, and 300 MW.
Greece’s energy storage program will draw €341 million ($372.3 million) from the European Union’s post-pandemic recovery fund, which was approved last year by the European Commission.
The program’s first and second tenders will focus on standalone energy storage projects connected to the Greek electricity transmission network. The tenders exclude the island network of Crete, which was linked to Greece’s mainland power grid in 2021.
Greece's energy storage scheme allows projects from the European Economic Area (EEA) outside of Greece, provided there is an electricity interconnection and fully coupled power grids between Greece and the EEA country. Currently, only Bulgaria meets these expectations. The eligible energy storage capacity from Bulgaria for Greece's first and second tenders depends on energy trading volumes and other criteria, with a limit of 31 MW.
The third tender of Greece's energy storage program focuses on standalone projects in designated energy transition areas, such as former coal mining regions. These projects will be connected to the transmission network.
The application process for the first tender closes on July 10, and the list of qualified bidders will be published on August 10. The auction date will be announced later this year. In addition, the application process for the second and third energy storage tenders will open by the end of this year.
Capex support
Greece's subsidy support for winning energy storage projects in the upcoming tenders is generous.
During the construction phase, all winning projects will receive a one-time payment of €200,000 per MW, which serves as a capital expenditure subsidy. Market sources suggest that this subsidy can cover approximately 40% of the battery project's construction costs at current prices.
In addition, winning projects will be granted contracts for difference (CfDs) that guarantee a certain income for 10 years. The CfD prices will be determined through the tenders. For the first energy storage auction, the regulator has set a capped CfD price of €115,000 per MW per year.
As a result, winning projects must participate in the energy market, such as Greece's wholesale electricity trading and secondary balancing services market. Each year, the government will assess the projects' market earnings. If the earnings are lower than the CfD price, investors will receive a top-up payment to bridge the difference. Conversely, if the earnings exceed the CfD price, the surplus must be returned to the state.
Energy storage projects participating in Greece's program are prohibited from engaging in the energy derivatives market and are unable to enter power purchase agreements (PPAs) with private investors.
Tender rules
To qualify for Greece's energy storage tenders, projects must possess an energy storage license, ensure a minimum 2-hour capacity duration, provide a minimum 1 MW injection capacity, and commence construction after a tender concludes.
The regulator has implemented rules to ensure competitiveness. The tender's subscription rule is set at 100%, meaning that at least 800 MW of energy storage capacity must compete for selection to award 400 MW of capacity. This rule maintains the auction's competitiveness, according to the regulator.
In the latest issue of pv magazine we turn the spotlight onto European solar with a comprehensive review of the state of the PV industry across the region’s key markets and a look at the legislation which aims to drive a solar rooftop boom. We also examine the difficulty of establishing a solar panel recycling industry in Australia, where industry backbiting isn’t helping matters.
Each tender must include a minimum of four independent participants with no business ties. Additionally, a participant cannot bid for more than 25% of the energy storage capacity offered in the auction. In Greece's energy storage program, a participant is limited to a maximum of 100 MW in the combined first and second tenders.
Tender participants face strict financial requirements, limiting bids to major players. Qualified participants must provide the regulator with three letters of guarantee from banks and financial institutions, demonstrating financial robustness: participation letter of guarantee (€35,000/MW), letter of guarantee for timely business performance (€250,000/MW), and letter of guarantee for quality operation (€200,000/MW). An application fee of €2,500 per submission to the regulator is also applicable.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/20/rooftop-pv-system-design-to-improve-yield-under-partial-shading/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 20, 2023",Rooftop PV system design to improve yield under partial shading,"Researchers from India's Department of Electrical Engineering have proposed a new PV system design that reportedly reduces mismatch losses and enhances power generation under partial shading conditions.
The novel design, which the scientists describe as a cost-effective and easy to control, combines conventional TCT techniques for PV systems with PPPCs.
“We are currently working on designing the hardware for the proposed concept,” researcher Subhash Vitthalrao Murkute told pv magazine. “TCT is the most preferred and widely used PV module interconnection in PV array, as it offers improved performance over all types of partial shading.”
However, the power enhancement capacity during partial shading conditions is limited by bypass diodes and blocking diodes. Advanced array reconfiguration techniques can increase this power output limit, but they also introduce higher system cost and complexity.
The research group referred to the use of PPPCs, stating that their application allows for processing only the mismatch power between the PV modules in the series string during partial shading conditions. The proposed system is based on the interconnection of PV arrays using TCT techniques and incorporates the use of a switched capacitor converter for partial power processing.
“This topology requires two switches for each row of parallel connected PV modules in array,” the academics said. “The main disadvantage of this scheme is it requires more hardware and also a complicated closed-loop control for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control to maximize power output.”
The system uses a resonant switched capacitor converter (RSC) in combination with a switch inductor converter (SLC). The researchers said this particular combination reduces the number of switches to only one per row instead of two.
They tested a 5 kW rooftop PV system with 20 solar panels under various partial shading conditions. They also compared its performance with that of the conventional TCT and series-parallel (SP) approaches.
“Results show that the power conversion efficiency of proposed system was between 95-99 percent for all shading conditions which is higher than S-P and TCT,” the Indian team said. “It shows that the proposed system under any partial shading condition, gives higher output power.”
The group said that power yield improvement compared to S-P and TCT was 4% to 30% and 0.5% to 19% higher, respectively.
“Results show that the proposed hybrid system improves the PV system performance under all types of shading conditions,” they concluded.
The researchers described the proposed system design in “New high performance PV system architecture for mitigation of partial shading effects,” which was recently published in e-Prime – Advances in Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/20/triple-cation-perovskite-pv-cell-with-etl-tiniv-oxide-hits-17-1-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,QATAR",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 20, 2023",Triple cation perovskite PV cell with ETL based on tin(IV) oxide hits 17.1% efficiency,"A research team led by Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU) in Qatar has developed a perovskite solar cell that uses an electron transport layer (ETL) based on tin(IV) oxide (SnO2). They say it could improve electron mobility in the device.
The scientists said in “Moderate temperature deposition of RF magnetron sputtered SnO2-based electron transporting layer for triple cation perovskite solar cells” that perovskite solar devices often use titanium oxide (TiO2 i) as the primary contributor to the light-induced degradation observed in perovskite solar cells.
“Unlike TiO2 material, SnO2 can be processed at much lower temperatures using different deposition technologies, including solution processes, electrodeposition, electron-beam, atomic layer deposition and magnetron sputtering,” the researchers said. “Among all these thin fabrication methods, magnetron sputtering (MS) is one of the most promising technologies due to its advantages related to cost-effectiveness and uniform large-scale SnO2 thin films.”
The research group sputtered the SnO2 material through high-energy argon-plasma ions on a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and glass. The cell also utilizes an absorber made of a perovskite material known as Cs0.05MA0.10FA0.85Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, a hole transporting layer (HTL) made of Spiro-OMeTAD, and a top electrode based on gold (Au).
The scientists said the SnO2 thin film showed high crystalline quality, as it incorporates more oxygen due to an air-thermal-annealing treatment.
“The SnO2 films have shown rather a high optical transmittance in the visible range which is higher than 80%,” they said. “The thermal annealing process has clearly enhanced the electrical conductivity by significantly increasing the electron mobility and this finding is matching with the increase in crystallite size after the annealing process.”
They compared the performance of the device with that of a reference cell with an ETL based on SnO2 deposited without the thermal annealing process. The latter achieved a power conversion efficiency of 15.07% and the former of 17.1%. The new cell also achieved an open-circuit voltage of 1.045 V, a short-circuit current of 22.01 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 74.3%, while showing an average operational lifetime over 200 h.
“Sputtered SnO2 as ETL was demonstrated to enable a good PV device performance, stability and lifetime and could serve as a promising route for further development and integration of sputtered SnO2 films into large-scale and cost-effective perovskite PV modules,” the research group concluded.

Solar Fast
One such announcement is the Green Prosperity Plan, which promises clean energy jobs and infrastructure buildout for £28 billion ($35.4 billion) per year.
Did I say £28 billion? It’s actually only £20 billion of new spending, according to left-leaning newspaper The Guardian, which reckons £8 billion of it has already been pledged by current PM Rishi Sunak.
As a solar technician, I’ve been asked many times how I feel about the spending plans. The simple answer is: I honestly don’t care – yet.
Throwing money at an industry does not prosperity make. At best, it provides a short-term, expensive boost that fast-tracks some projects that probably would have happened anyway. At worst, it becomes a public spending headache, and the money might not even be sent where it needs to go. Just ask Spain and China.
The spending is nowhere near as important as a plan, developed with us, the industry.
As climate scientist Michael E Mann constantly reiterates: Action comes from both a feeling of urgency (the need to act soon to secure a decent future) and agency (a feeling of being able to make a difference). I see urgency as the stick and agency as the carrot.
Green infrastructure policy must take both elements into account. If a company has no agency, it cannot pursue solar, usually due to expense. If a company has no urgency, solar will be kicked down the road.
Excellent green policy transforms business models to de-risk investment and set up a welcoming environment for sustainable industry.
The turbulent reign of Boris ‘Partygate’ Johnson brought policies which combined carrot and stick surprisingly well.
Carrots including the Super Deduction Tax of up to 130% for first-year capital spending, for businesses, and 0% VAT for domestic solar installs reduced payback times and initial costs, making PV more accessible.
Soaring energy costs and alarmist headlines were sticks that pushed a 114% increase in solar installs this year on top of consistent annual acceleration.
By comparison, Australia saw a deceleration in PV installations last year, despite a federal election dismissing an environmentally-destructive coalition government.
Newly-elected Labor PM Anthony Albanese raised green industry hopes but little has changed other than discourse at the top.
Australia’s 2022 Climate Change Act may have enshrined more ambitious emission reduction targets in law but it provides nothing for the solar industry to sink its teeth into.
The nation is limited to state-level tax incentives and grants. All carrot, no stick. That’s why a UK Labour government may not be a silver bullet for the problems of solar.
Few are paying attention to Australia anyway when The White House is throwing hundreds of billions of dollars around. US president Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has prompted a serious reaction from an EU keen to protect its green industries.
IRA is the first significant climate legislation to pass both houses of Congress.
Labour’s £28 billion pales alongside Biden’s $385 billion of clean energy tax breaks and incentives, right?
Again: it’s what you do with the cash that counts.
Tax incentives are great for utility-scale projects in a stable, Congress-approved policy environment but I believe the solar revolution will primarily be a war of attrition, targeting untapped rooftops and promoting decentralized, localized grids.
Otherwise, we’re simply asking for grid trouble as we require huge extra spending to cope with variable generation from solar and wind plants. This is something that hadn’t even started to be tackled in the US until permitting reforms were smuggled into the deal signed off between Biden and house speaker Kevin McCarthy recently to raise the nation’s borrowing ceiling.
Here are some ideas about what should be included in the next UK government’s green spending plans.
Firstly, tariff reform.
As UK network operator National Grid spells out in its “Live Report,” surges in electricity demand at peak times drive spikes in fossil fuel generation, as well as wasted generation at off-peak times, when the sun shines but demand is low. Few energy companies incentivize off-peak usage, other than for electric car owners. Labour should encourage them to push this, to increase renewable energy demand.
Tariff reform could be developed alongside an education program informing the public it’s not just about building more but about manipulating peak usage to maximise consumption of what already exists.
That would help harmonize the relationship between the grid and solar developers, to foster a more welcoming permitting environment.
Secondly, more should be done to discourage fossil fuel generation.
Increasing taxes on the public, such as fuel duty and carbon levies, is rarely popular, as has been seen in Canada and France. Labour will need to tread carefully but a stick is essential. A new government must illustrate the catastrophic effect fossil fuels have on consumer and business electricity bills by highlighting the disparity between energy sources.
Labour must decouple year-ahead energy prices from fossil fuels so suppliers who procure cheaper, cleaner energy pay significantly lower wholesale prices, which can then be passed on.
If this can be achieved, fossil fuels would quickly be deemed financially unviable.
Finally, photovoltaics should be accessible to all.
Solar is a huge investment out of reach for commercial and residential customers without significant savings. This leads to an “us and them” situation in which green investment is seen as a middle-class luxury, benefiting those who need it least.
That is where Labour’s money should be spent. The party could give the, state-owned UK Infrastructure Bank a mandate to provide very low-interest loans to those who install solar, with return payments based on electricity bill reductions. That would mean customers and businesses would have no risk from upfront cost or rising energy costs. It would be a no-brainer.
Those suggestions, fleshed-out effectively, would be a wonderful mix of carrot, stick, and business-model reform, rather than focusing on headline-grabbing numbers. They may not be as flashy but that is what would get me excited about the next election.

The Committee of Permanent Representatives of the European Union (Coreper) has approved its redesign. The vote was preceded by almost two years of negotiations at all EU levels.
The European Parliament and the European Commission approved the package at the end of March. The new provisions are now legally binding.
The package includes doubling the expansion target for renewable energy, aiming for a 45% share in the union's energy mix by 2030, compared to the previous target of 32.5%. In order to achieve the new ambitious target, wind power and PV systems with capacities of more than 100 GW will have to be installed in the European Union every year.
Under RED III, the legal obligations include expanding renewable energies in the heating and transport sectors. In the building sector, the aim is to cover 49% of the heating requirement in new buildings with renewable energy. The goal is to increase this coverage by 0.8% per year until 2025 and by 1.1% in the subsequent years.
The EU has raised the renewable energy target for transport from 14% to 29%. It has also addressed the question of whether e-fuels from nuclear power should be included in the sector targets. The clarification states that while such fuels can be produced, they do not count toward the transport sector target.
By 2030, 42% of the hydrogen consumed in the industry should also be “green.” By 2035, this proportion is set to rise to 60%.
The legal definition of “green hydrogen” has now been established. It states that the electricity used for electrolysis must be fed into the grid and consumed simultaneously with the operation of the electrolyzers in the same grid area. In addition, faster approvals have been agreed upon. Part of the RED III also provides for an acceleration of the approval process for renewable energy.
Last year, the EU emergency regulation declared the expansion of renewable energies as a project of exceptional public importance. Consequently, a maximum approval period of 12 months was established. Designated priority areas may also be identified, eliminating the need for a secondary assessment of environmental and species protection at the project level.

Neoen has secured a contract with AEMO to supply most of the first-stage capacity for its 1 GW/4 GWh big battery in Collie, Western Australia. The battery project aims to address the solar duck curve and ensure smoother energy supplies.
The initial capacity of the Collie battery project is set to be 219 MW/877 MWh, with 197 MW of storage capacity contracted to AEMO. The agreement stipulates that the battery will charge during the day, leveraging high solar generation, and discharge during the evening peak demand.
With this contract under its belt, Neoen has now given the green light to technology partner Tesla and construction contractor UGL, owned by CIMIC Group, to start construction for the first stage. Neoen has said the first stage is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2024, but given that the AEMO contract goes into effect from Oct. 1, 2024, this would appear to be a hard deadline.
A Neoen spokesperson told pv magazine Australia that it opted to size the battery with more capacity, 22 MW over the contracted 197 MW, in order to provide “reasonable buffer” to ensure that the contracted power will be delivered at the point of connection.

“They are the result of a special cell arrangement that enabled Sunova Solar to come up with efficiencies of up to 22.9%, the highest currently in the market among modules made of TOPCon cells,” said the manufacturer.
The new panel design consists of 182 mm x 186 mm cells, according to a Sunova Solar statement. The Thor 5X modules feature 144 n-type monocrystalline cells and weigh 32.5 kg. They measure 2,333 mm x 1,134 mm x 35 mm. The open-circuit voltage ranges between 52.25 V and 52.97 V and the short-circuit current is between 15.52 A and 15.67 A. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The panels feature a junction box with an IP 68 rating and a frame made of anodized aluminum alloy. Both sides of the modules are covered with 2.0 mm glass. They have an operating temperature ranging between -40 C and 85 C, and the temperature coefficient is -0.32 % per degree Celsius.
“Like all Sunova Solar’s TOPCon modules, they are offered with a 30-year performance and 15-year product warranty,” the company stated. “Mass sales will commence in October, by when the modules will be fully certified.”
The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power. Sunova Solar claims a bifacial gain of up to 30%.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/06/20/bangladesh-improves-conditions-for-domestic-independent-power-producers/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,BANGLADESH",SYFUL ISLAM,"JUNE 20, 2023",Bangladesh improves conditions for domestic independent power producers,"The government of Bangladesh has implemented measures to help domestic IPPs to increase their share of the renewable energy market.
The new rules allow Bangladesh's IPPs to hold a 100% stake in companies owning renewable energy projects, removing the previous 80% limit that required a foreign investor for the remaining percentage.
Under the previous rules, domestic IPPs were also allowed to submit projects through international consortia and to take a 51% share in them, while foreign developers were limited to a maximum share of 20%.
“These new rules will bring more entrepreneurs in renewable energy business at the time when Bangladesh is reeling under severe power crisis that seriously hampered industrial production and brought misery in people’s life due to prolonged load shedding,” said a government spokesperson.
The decision has been submitted to the IPP cell of Bangladesh Power Development Board for necessary changes in bidding criteria.
“We have sent our decision to the IPP cell of Bangladesh Power Development Board for necessary changes in bidding criteria to facilitate the generation of renewable energy,” said Nirod Chandra Mondal, a joint secretary at the Ministry of Power.
However, Imran Chowdhury, the head of business development-Bangladesh for Total Eren, expressed concerns about the execution of projects without experienced operating partners as shareholders.
“The changes in the qualification criteria may help mainly the local sponsor to pass the qualification criteria easily, but a key concern can be how they can execute the project smoothly without having any experienced operating partner in the project as shareholder,” said Chowdhury.

The comprehensive solution, developed with SolarGik, includes mounting structures, inverters, power optimizers, a dedicated tracker per structure, and a monitoring platform.
Arnold Bourges, France sales director for SolarEdge, said that the structure's height allows agricultural machinery to pass by, while the spacing of pillars can be adjusted to minimize the ground footprint. Each structure is independent, enabling panels to be oriented differently based on field location or terrain variations.
SolarEdge is already implementing the technology in major projects throughout the world, although specific details were not provided.
The company has also introduced a storage system for commercial buildings in the C&I solar sector. The DC-coupled system has a 58 kWh capacity and supports indoor use.
It allows the connection of up to eight batteries per inverter, with a total capacity of 464 kWh. The DC-coupled architecture reduces losses compared to AC-coupled alternatives by eliminating two AC-to-DC conversions.
The storage system is expected to become available in the second half of 2024.
