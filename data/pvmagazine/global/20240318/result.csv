The state-run agency said that 134 MW of PV projects were selected in the procurement exercise. It was Japan's nineteenth auction for utility-scale solar and was expected to assign 349.3 MW of generating capacity.
The 29 selected projects range in size from 550 kW to 29.9 MW.
The lowest bid was JPY 0.0/kWh, the highest was JPY 6.98 /kWh, and the average final price was JPY 5.11 ($0.034)/kWh. The ceiling price was set at JPY 9.28/kWh.
A bid of JPY 0.00/kWh was submitted for a 19 MW PV project submitted by Japanese developer FS Japan Project 41. According to local reports, the project has already secured a private power purchase agreement for the sale of electricity and participated in the auction to secure a grid connection.
The lowest bid was the reason behind the surprisingly low average price of JPY 5.11/kWh of the auction. In the last five auctions, the final average price ranged from JPY 8.55/kWh to JPY 9.73/kWh.
In the 18th auction, finalized in November 2023, the Japanese authorities allocated 105 MW of PV capacity, with the lowest bid reaching JPY 7.94/kWh.  In the 17th exercise, held in late August 2023, the lowest price came in at JPY 8.95/kWh, with 69 MW of allocated capacity.
In the 16th auction held in July 2023, the allocated power was 119.7 MW and the lowest bid came in at JPY 9/kWh. In the 15th solar energy auction, which concluded in March 2023, the Green Investment Promotion Organization only allocated 16.2 MW of the 175 MW tendered. The lowest bid offered in the auction was JPY 9.48/kWh and the average final price was JPY 9.56.
In the 14th exercise, held in November 2022, the Japanese authorities assigned 137.2 MW of PV capacity, out of 175 MW tendered. The lowest bid came in at JPY 9.65/kWh and the average final price was JPY 9.73/kWh.
In the 12th procurement exercise, which was finalized in June 2022, the assigned PV capacity was 153.7 MW. The lowest bid came in at JPY 8.85/kWh. In the 11th auction, held in March 2022, the assigned PV capacity was 268.7 MW and the lowest bid was JPY 8.99/kWh.
In 2021, the Japanese government allocated 675 MW of PV capacity across three different auctions. In previous auctions, it allocated 942 MW.

Endesa, through its Enel Green Power Spain unit, has commissioned an energy storage system based on vanadium redox flow batteries at the Son Orlandis solar plant in Mallorca, Spain.
The 1.1 MW/5.5 MWh battery is the first energy storage plant that the company has built in Spain with this technology. It claimed that it is the largest vanadium flow battery to be paired with a PV plant in Europe.
“This type of battery has the advantage of having a useful life of over 20 years without suffering any degradation, which makes them very interesting to guarantee long-term storage, in this case, more than siy hours,” the company said in a statement. “In addition, they offer enormous security benefits.”
The storage system is linked to a 3.34 MW solar plant. The system's capture and discharge operations are optimized based on renewable production and network needs, so demand peaks can be met.
The Son Orlandis battery system has been made in collaboration with Canadian manufacturer Largo, which provided its Vcharge cooling system. The system's electrolyte has an “infinite” useful life and can be easily reused at the end of its useful life without degrading and without a negative impact on the environment, said Endesa.
Endesa won 72.4 MW of solar capacity in the latest renewable energy auctions for the Balearic Islands. The Orlandis PV plant is one of the awarded projects and was commissioned in 2022.

The figure consists of 1.1 GW already in operation, producing 1.5 TWh of electricity per year. Another 400 MW will be commissioned by the end of this year, said the company.
The PPAs are in place with more than 600 industrial and commercial customers throughout the world. TotalEnergies said that by solarizing its customer’s sites, it is supporting the energy transition of the agrifood, automotive, cement, digital, manufacturing, metals, mining, retail, and warehousing industries.
TotalEnergies said it develops, finances, builds, and operates solar panels installed on rooftops, carports, and vacant industrial sites. It then sells the renewable electricity through long-term PPAs. The company's distributed generation solutions are currently present in more than 30 countries, across all continents. 
“In an unstable market with high energy prices, we provide our customers not only decarbonized energy but also visibility and operational excellence throughout the duration of the PPA”, said Vincent Stoquart, senior vice president renewables for TotalEnergies.
At the end of last year, the company’s gross renewable capacity stood at 22 GW installed. It has set a target of 35 GW in 2025, alongside ambitions to get to net zero by 2050.
In December 2023, research firm Mercom said that TotalEnergies was the largest, global utility-scale solar developer from July 2022 to June 2023. 
Over the past year, the company has acquired French agrivoltaics specialist Ombrea and independent power producer Total Eren.

The minister said in a statement that groundworks on the first facility are already being carried out at the chosen locations, and the resources for their assembly and completion are guaranteed, “once they arrive in the nation.”
The minister expressed hope for the country to recover from its delay in reaching a 24% penetration of these technologies by 2030, without elaborating on the announced projects.
“We have opted to get out of the crisis with our own resources, despite the energy situation we are facing,” said the minister. “We had very bad months on the Island due to the lack of fuel. However, the maintenance carried out by the Electrical Union to recover the technical condition of the thermoelectric plants has made it possible to reduce breakdowns.”
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Cuba had 258 MW of installed solar power by the end of 2022.

The Samarkand and Jizzakh solar power plants, located in eastern Uzbekistan, were developed and built by Masdar and contracted by International Cooperation Co Ltd., a subsidiary of Dongfang Electric Corp.
The plants feature 11,248 sets of Vanguard 1P trackers, supplied by Chinese manufacturer TrinaTracker.
TrinaTracker said its Vanguard 1P tracker is adaptable to diverse terrains, delivering high energy yield and reliability while reducing investment costs. It claims the contracted tube design and patented spherical bearings cut installation times by 20%.
Once fully connected to the grid, the Samarkand and Jizzakh plants will generate 1.12 billion kWh a year, powering 240,000 households and cutting carbon dioxide emissions by more than 1 million tons a year.
Historically, Uzbekistan has been reliant on thermal power and has faced frequent power outages, but its solar deployment has accelerated in recent times.
Figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency show that Uzbekistan had 3.5 MW of installed solar in 2020, 103.5 MW in 2021, and 252.5 MW in 2022. The country aims to deploy 8 GW by 2030.
In March 2023, Saudi Arabian energy giant ACWA Power said it had secured several power purchase agreements totaling 1.4 GW of solar power and 1.5 GWh of storage capacity in Uzbekistan.

Solar Brother has announced the launch of SunAéro, a solar heating system that heats and renews the air in rooms measuring 20 m² to 60 m².
The system combines PV and thermal energy to heat, renew or dehumidify the air in the rooms of a home. It reportedly allows homeowners to lower their traditional heating thermostat by 3 C to 5 C.
“SunAéro is a complete kit that incorporates a large number of electronic components,” Gilles Gallo, president of Solar Brother, told pv magazine France.
It includes a controller, a 32 W solar panel from US-based Maxeon, a ventilation grill, a connecting duct, a Wi-Fi connection, a 103 cm x 76 cm x 7 cm aerothermal heat pump panel, cassette filtration, and a fixing system, available in white, black, or anthracite.
The filtration cassette captures and filters outside air and the aerothermal unit absorbs heat and warms the circulating air. The latter is “the brain of the system,” as it drives the flow of hot air toward the interior of the space that must be heated.
The 600 W SunAéro aerothermal heat pump panel features tempered glass, lacquered aluminum frame and is light and ultrathin. The insulation used has a thermal resistance of about 0.5 m²/kW.
The aerothermal panel with the filtration cassette weighs 20 kg and, according to the manufacturer, can be easily handled by a single person during installation. For larger spaces, installers can combine two or three solar panels with a single controller.
The SunAéro unit is completely autonomous thanks to the photovoltaic panel. Depending on the settings, the fan of the aerothermal system blows between 50 and 200 m3 per hour of hot air into the house. The injected air is between 20 C and 40 C higher than the outside air temperature at an airflow rate of 3 m/s, which provides 3 C to 5 C of heat to the room.
The system turns off automatically when the sun sets. For maintenance, the cassette filter can be cleaned once a year with a little water.
SunAéro is a plug-and-play system that can be installed vertically or horizontally on the exterior of a home facing the sun, using modular panels that are mechanically fixed to the wall with quick-release fasteners. It takes between one and three hours to complete a turnkey installation, depending on whether it is deployed on wood or concrete.
Solar Brother is based in Caroles, southeastern France.

7,https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/03/18/scientists-identify-new-promising-absorber-material-for-thin-film-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-03-18,Scientists identify new ‘promising’ absorber material for thin-film solar cells,"Researchers led by Dartmouth College in the United States have identified zintl-phosphide (BaCd2P2) as a potential new absorber material for thin-film solar cells after conducting a high-throughput (HT) computational screening among 40,000 promising inorganic materials.
“Based on its dopability, this material could be used as a p-type absorber layer for pn junction cells or as an intrinsic absorber layer for p-i-n cells,” researcher Zhenkun Yuan told pv magazine.
The group selected the inorganic materials from the Materials Project database, which is an open-access database describing material properties that can be used to accelerate the development of a given technology by predicting how new materials, both real and hypothetical, can be potentially utilized.
Through the screening, the scientists initially identified materials that offer a suitable band gap, small effective masses, and promising defect properties. “Among these promising candidates, we select the zintl-phosphide (BaCd2P2) and explicitly show that the computed nonradiative recombination rates in BaCd2P2 are better than or comparable with those in high-efficiency solar absorbers such as the halide perovskites,” they explained.
After identifying the material, the group found that zintl-phosphide can be very stable both in air and water. “You can put it out for six months and it will stay the same,” added the research's corresponding author, Geoffroy Hautier. “When you don't have to worry about moisture and air contamination, that significantly reduces your costs.”
By conducting bright photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC), it also found the material has a potential energy bandgap of 1.45 eV and a carrier lifetime of up to 30 ns.
“All of these results indicate that BaCd2P2 is a promising high-performance solar cell absorber with the potential to open a new avenue in PV for an entire family of Zintl AM2X2 solar absorbers, where A and M are +2 ions and X is a pnictogen,” the researchers said.
“We won't have it as a solar panel tomorrow,” added Hautier, “but we think this family of materials is exceptional and worth looking at.”
Their findings were presented in the paper “Discovery of the Zintl-phosphide BaCd2P2 as a long carrier lifetime and stable solar absorber,” published in Joule.

The scientists analyzed, in particular, the behavior of solar irradiance in a south-oriented facility hosting a tree crop in hedges planted in the same direction and found there is geometric space between the panel rows where the crop would not shade the modules.
The proposed methodology is specifically intended to identify these non-shading zones between the two-axis solar trackers. “Based on this analysis, an innovative method is proposed to estimate the maximum available space that could be occupied by crops within photovoltaic plants with rectangular collectors on dual-axis trackers with backtracking,” they explained.
In the study “Methodology for the estimation of cultivable space in photovoltaic installations with dual-axis trackers for their reconversion to agrivoltaic plants,” published in Applied Energy, the academics said the novel methodology initially defines the West, South, and Azimut vectors that characterize the PV system.
It also considers the latitude of the place and the solar declination, as well as the hour angle given by the angular rotation speed of the Earth, the time with respect to solar noon, and the unit vector directed towards the solar disk at all times.
“Once the azimuth and the elevation of the solar collectors are known, it is possible to determine the unit normal vector to the surface of the collectors at each instant,” the academics explained, noting that the proposed approach analyzes the behavior of the vectors as a consequence of the movement of the collectors that depends on the position of the sun at each instant.
The novel methodology was applied via a simulation to the Molino photovoltaic plant, which is located in Cordoba and is equipped with dual-axis solar trackers, in an effort to identify pentagonal arable space between the collectors.
This analysis allowed the researchers to identify, along the North-South direction, several trapezoidal profile streets available for cultivation. These have a width of 10.5 m, a minimum height of 1.31 m in the lateral areas,  and a maximum height of 2.81 m in the middle area.
The scientists said the curve of the percentage of the maximum cultivable area is a function of the crop height. “The actual cultivated land will be lower as this maximum cultivable area may be adapted to the typical and appropriate alignment and geometry for the specific crop selected, as well as to the constraints imposed by the farming operation of the crop,” they specified.
They found that the Molino plant offers up to 74% of arable land in the space between collectors, and said that this space decreases as the height of the crop increases. “Therefore, the agricultural production of the agricultural plant and its yield will depend on the crop finally selected,” they emphasized.

In remote areas, it can guarantee stable power supplies and even almost replace public grids with strong power fluctuations, as well as diesel generators.
The company said the system can also be used as an electricity supply in case of extreme weather conditions. The modular platform combines multiple containers with battery and energy storage systems, ensuring easy transportation with standardized ISO 668 container dimensions and a permanent “CSC badge” for security.
The container measures 6 meters x 2.4 meters x 2.9 meters and weighs 20 tons. It consists of 240 solar modules placed on a folding system that can be removed and stored.
The system has a capacity of up to 140 kW and can extend over a total length of 120 meters (60 meters per side). The result is a maximum possible solar area of around 720 m². This two-sided deployment concept allows the length of cables between the panels and the inverter to be shortened, increasing the efficiency of power generation.
Once the rail system and transport unit are installed, the container is virtually invisible when the fully wired module frames are extended. The container therefore does not cast a shadow on the mobile PV system.
SolarCont GmbH is an Austrian joint venture set up in 2022 by container technology specialist Gföllner and Austrian PV system supplier Hilber Solar.

Construction has begun on the 500 MW/2,000 MWh Collie battery energy storage system in Western Australia’s (WA) southwest as the state moves towards emissions-free power generation in 2030.
Synergy said the four-hour battery energy storage system – scheduled for completion before the end of 2025 – will help to prepare the state’s power grid for the retirement of coal-fired power stations by improving system security and support increased renewable energy generation in the South West Interconnected System (SWIS).
Western Australian Energy Minister Reece Whitby said the battery will absorb excess energy generated by rooftop PV systems when the sun is shining and discharge when demand for electricity peaks, usually in the evening.
“This is an exciting milestone for Western Australia’s decarbonization journey,” he said. “When complete, this battery will support reliability and more renewable energy on WA’s main electricity grid.”
Synergy is building the AUD 1.6 billion ($1.05 billion) Collie big battery approximately 200 kilometers southwest of state capital Perth, just north of the existing coal-fired Collie Power Station that is to be retired by 2027. The facility will connect to the SWIS via Western Power’s existing 330 kV Schotts Terminal.
Collie-based earthworks specialists Cardinal Contractors has been awarded the contract to complete site preparation earthworks for the battery facility, with up to 500 jobs expected to be created at the peak of construction.
The Collie battery will be Synergy’s third large-scale battery energy storage system with the government-owned energy generator and retailer planning to build 3 GWh hours of storage by 2025.
Synergy said the 100 MW/200 MWh first stage of the Kwinana Battery Energy Storage System, built at the site of the decommissioned Kwinana Power Station about 30 kilometers south of Perth, has been providing power to the SWIS since it was completed in May 2023.
Work is continuing on the 200 MW/800 MWh second stage of that facility and is due to be completed in late 2024.
The WA government has estimated that the SWIS may need about 50 GW of new renewable electricity and storage infrastructure to support increased demand over the next 20 years.
Synergy’s big battery is one of two grid-scale energy storage systems being constructed at Collie.
French renewables giant Neoen is in the process of building the first stage of a planned 1 GW/4 GWh battery at Collie with the developer predicting the facility will be operational “by or before 2025.”

“The reason we added a module with a framed structure and glass thickness of 3 mm to our Solid line, which is normally frameless, stems from market demand, especially from installers,” Solitek CEO, Julius Sakalauskas, told pv magazine.
“A framed structure offers easier installation, while ensuring the extreme durability of our modules, thanks to the robustness provided by the thicker glass, which can withstand heavy snow loads and hail resistance.”
The module is categorized as overhead glazing according to German Institute for Building Technology (DIBt) code. It has hail resistance of class 4 and fire class A rating and can withstand snow loads up to 10,500 Pa and up to 5,400 Pa of wind load.
Made with 60 p-type monocrystalline M6-sized PERC cells, the 370 W module has 19.57 % power conversion efficiency. It weighs 32 kg and measures 1782 mm x 1061 mm x 35 mm. The open-circuit voltage is 40.50 V and the short-circuit current is between 11.18 A. The maximum system voltage is 1,000 V.
The panels also feature a junction box with an IP 68 rating and a frame made of black anodized aluminum.
Both sides of the modules are covered with 3.0 mm glass. The front side has PV glass with antireflective coating while the backside utilizes float glass. They have an operating temperature ranging between -40 C and 85 C, and the temperature coefficient is -0.32 % per degree Celsius.
Solitek offers a 30-year product warranty and the 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87% of the nominal output power.
