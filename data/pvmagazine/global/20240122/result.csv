Native grass and wildflowers were planted at the two solar facilities, operated by Enel Green Power North America, in early 2018. Between August 2018 and August 2022, the research group conducted 358 observational surveys of flowering vegetation and insect communities.
They found that total insect levels tripled, with native bees showing a 20-fold increase in numbers. The most commonly observed insect groups were beetles, flies and moths. An increase in native plant species was also noted, while pollinators from the solar sites were seen visiting and pollinating soybean flowers in adjacent crop fields.
Lee Waltson, a landscape ecologist and environmental scientist who was the lead author of the study, said the research “highlights the relatively rapid insect community responses to habitat restoration at solar energy sites.” 
“It demonstrates that, if properly sited, habitat-friendly solar energy can be a feasible way to safeguard insect populations and can improve the pollination services in adjacent agricultural fields,” said Waltson.
The Argonne National Laboratory said the findings suggest that habitat-friendly solar sites could play an important role in conserving biodiversity and mitigating land-use conflicts associated with the conversion of farmland for solar energy production. It noted that this could be particularly beneficial for the future development of ground-mounted solar.
However, they warned that additional research is needed to understand the feasibility of habitat-friendly solar across different regions and to meet ecological goals such as conserving target insects or wildlife species.

Reliance Industries is selling REC Solar Norway to Elkem ASA, an Oslo-listed silicon-based materials supplier.
Reliance Industries’ subsidiary, REC Solar Holdings, has signed a share purchase agreement with Elkem ASA for the sale of its 100% equity stake in REC Solar Norway AS (REC Norway) for $22 million.
Upon completion of the sale, REC Solar Norway will cease to be a subsidiary of the company. REC Solar Holdings AS and its subsidiaries, engaged in the business of manufacturing and sale of solar PV HJT cells and modules, will continue to be Reliance Industries' subsidiaries.
REC Solar Norway, a wholly owned subsidiary of REC Solar Holdings AS, manufactures kerf-based polysilicon in its home country. In November, it closed its polysilicon production operations in Kristiansand and Porsgrunn.
“We have reached the point where it is unfortunately not possible to make the production of high-purity silicon in Norway viable,” REC CEO Jan Enno Bicker said at the time.
Reliance Industries said it will retain the technology and intellectual property rights for kerf-based polysilicon.
REC Norway had a turnover of NOK 1.1 billion ($104.9 million) in fiscal 2022.
“The above transaction is subject to certain regulatory and other customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed by April 2024,” said Reliance Industries.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/22/the-rise-of-back-contact-cell-architecture/,"SPONSORED,WORLD",,"JANUARY 22, 2024",The rise of back contact cell architecture,"For a long time, solar cell efficiency gains have been the main means of improving module output power not only as an important performance attribute, but also as a sales metric.
Higher module efficiency reduces the balance of system (BOS) costs, thus reducing the overall final PV system costs. After commercializing various cell technologies, leading PV manufacturers now are once again moving back to putting most or all contact elements on the rear of the cell – but now using advanced cell architectures.
These new architectures don’t just boost the efficiency and power output of solar modules, they also result in system-level advantages ─ such as better low light response, temperature coefficient, and degradation rates ─ that increase the energy yield. Every technology advancement that boosts efficiency helps reduce the final levelized cost of electricity generation (LCOE), making solar energy more cost competitive.
High efficiency led the move from traditional back surface field (BSF) cell technology to PERC and other cell types, while TOPCon is currently the technology of choice in the mainstream. However, back contact cell architecture has consistently proven its worth in terms of efficiency.
The underlying principle of back contact technology is the placement of the positive and negative contacts on the backside of the cell, which provides numerous benefits. With both contacts at the rear, the front surface remains unobstructed, maximizing both the cell's exposure to sunlight and its light absorption. This structure minimizes the surface area where recombination can occur, leading to improved electron flow and increased efficiency. Variants of this technology include Emitter Wrap-Through (EWT), Metal Wrap-Through (MWT) ─ where only the busbar is placed at the rear ─ and Interdigitated Back Contact cells (IBC).
Of the above, IBC is the most promising. In 2022, the most efficient commercial IBC solar module first achieved the 23% efficiency level, and a back-contact based solar module made in China recently even reached the 24% level. In both cases, the module was manufactured by AIKO.
IBC operates on the principle that the charge carriers generated near the front surface can still be collected at the rear side of the cell. The resulting benefits, in short, are:
Creating alternating regions on the rear side with n- and p-doping is the most critical part of realizing IBC. Depending on the emitter doping type, n- or p-passivation materials can be selected ─ such as silicon nitride for the n-surface and aluminum oxide or silicon oxide for the p-surface.
Back contact solar cell technology isn't new. It was invented in the late-1970s, but it took until the first decade of this century until it was commercialized. Advancements in materials and manufacturing processes have allowed for noteworthy gains in the efficiency levels of IBC cells. Over the last few years, there's been a significant uptick in the number of companies that have mastered this technology. Among the four most efficient solar modules, three are based on back contact cell technology, and all of them have at least 23% module efficiency.
It is noteworthy that the IBC structure can be adapted to either p-type or n-type wafers and can even be implemented onto different cell architectures, such as TOPCon or HJT. However, the best commercial cell efficiencies so far have been attained by combining the back contact layout with the n-type TOPCon architecture – the approach AIKO has chosen to follow. In its recent World Energy Investment 2023 report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) states that n-type cells will lead the market by 2033. AIKO calls its current technology ABC, which stands for ”all back contact,” and has attained mass production efficiency of 26.5% for its cells.
AIKO began developing its ABC cell architecture in 2021. This marked a turning point that enabled the company to venture into module-making, and ultimately, to evolve into a one-stop solution provider for downstream customers. Building on this achievement, in 2022, AIKO launched its first-generation ABC module with an efficiency of 23.6%, which has now increased to 24% as announced in 2023.

The key to mastering IBC technology is interdigitated doping of the solar cell. AIKO developed a procedure to isolate and fabricate the interdigitated carrier-selective collector regions to maximize high minority carrier lifetime, and it mastered the rear surface passivation, handling the presence of the opposite polarities of dopants on the backside of the solar cell. The approach safeguards efficiency while also simplifying an otherwise complex and costly process. Another significant cost reduction step taken by AIKO is to employ copper for the cell’s metallization, instead of the more expensive silver common to most other cell technologies.
The back contact structure also presents a unique interconnection opportunity. Since the contacts of both polarities lie on the same side, the ribbons don’t have to be connected from the back of one cell to the front of the next; they can run straight, which avoids bending and allows the cells to be densely packed, improving the utilization rate of the module area.
The superior attributes of back contact architecture include high power density, which reduces costs associated with mounting hardware, cabling, and labor ─ contributing to a cut of about 7% in BOS costs. A temperature coefficient of -0.26%/℃  adds to gains in the power yield. While less efficient solar modules are offered with 25-year performance warranties, there is no one offering back contact cell-based modules with performance warranties under 30 years.
A solar panel built with back contact cells comes with a very uniform look, undisturbed by front contacts, especially when complemented with a black backsheet and black frame. This makes the product highly valued in residential applications. However, the technology can be adapted to all mainstream applications. For example, AIKO currently has in its portfolio four products for residential applications, four for C&I, and one for utility-scale power plants. The residential products are available in dual glass and single glass configurations and are offered in two variants: the black series, which the company says has superior aesthetics, and the white series with higher output power. Within the C&I series, products include glass backsheet modules in both black and white variants, a dual-glass product, and a lightweight module. The company’s 72-cell dual-glass bifacial modules are part of its utility product portfolio.
The Intersolar AWARD 2023 honored AIKO’s achievements for designing the world’s most efficient commercial solar module using back contact cell technology. With the top module efficiencies relying on back contact cells, moving backwards has meant a big leap forward, demonstrating that solar cell technology roads will likely lead to back contacts.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/22/investor-group-warns-of-revenue-risk-for-pv-farms-in-southwestern-australia/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 22, 2024",Investor group warns of revenue risk for PV farms in southwestern Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
The Clean Energy Investor Group (CEIG) has predicted that intra-regional loss factors for generation projects in southwest New South Wales (NSW) and northwest Victoria could decrease by up to 10% compared to the 2023-24 financial year after the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) released its preliminary marginal loss factors (MLFs) for 2024-25.
“The preliminary MLFs will deliver a blow to solar farms who had finally been able to increase their output after Transgrid made some fixes to the transmission network in southwest NSW,” said CEIG Policy Director Marilyne Crestias.
AEMO said the MLFs outlined in the Preliminary Marginal Loss Factors: FY 2024-25 report are “indicative” and intended to provide an early indication to stakeholders of the potential direction and the extent of movement in MLFs across the National Electricity Market (NEM).
MLFs represent the transmission losses within each of the five regions of the NEM and depend on factors such as the amount of existing and new generation, electricity flows, and supply and demand. An MLF of 1.0 indicates that all of the output is credited, but an MLF of 0.75 means projects could potentially lose 25% of their revenue.
Crestias said because of the way they are calculated, MLFs can change materially year on year and any changes directly translate to the revenue that generators receive for their output.
“MLFs have a direct impact on the revenue received by generators, and this volatility and lack of predictability create risk for investors,” she said. “This is not just an issue for generators and investors – lack of revenue predictability adds risk, which ultimately impacts the price and make-up of the electricity used by consumers.”
AEMO preliminary calculations show that MLFs in southwestern New South Wales have decreased materially, driven by a notable increase in the generation capacity within this area and a reduction in the level of congestion within the area.
“Congestion has been less than that anticipated, which has resulted in increased production by impacted generation,” the market operator said. “This increase in generation has impacted MLF outcomes in two ways, by concentrating generation toward the middle of the day and increasing flows.”
The AEMO said northwestern Victoria has also seen notable reductions, due to an increase in local generation and a decrease in local load resulting in increased net exports from this area.
Some of the Victorian generation projects facing MLF cuts include the Bannerton Solar Farm which is set to have its intra-regional loss factor reduced from 0.8947 to 0.8349 while the Gannawarra Solar Farm faces a reduction from 0.9413 to 0.8965. The Kiamal Solar Farm is set to have its MLF reduced from 0.8755 to 0.8144 while the Karadoc Solar Farm faces a cut from 0.8877 to 0.8235.
In southwest NSW, the Sunraysia Solar Farm faces a reduction from 0.8255 to 0.7524, the Broken Hill Solar Farm is set to have its MLF cut from 0.8324 to 0.7467, and the Finley Solar Farm faces a cut from 0.9255 to 0.8738. The Limondale solar farms 1 and 2 also face reductions, from 0.8255 and 0.8310 to 0.7524 and 0.7585, respectively.
In contrast to southwest NSW and northern Victoria solar farms, generators in Queensland are forecasted to enjoy MLF increases, those Tasmania are also winners in this draft document while MLFs in South Australia have, on average, seen little variation.

S-5!, a specialist in solar attachments for metal roofs, has introduced its new MLPE Mount product.
The company describes the MLPE Mount as a universal, cost-effective method for attaching module level power electronics (MLPE) directly to solar module frames. The MLPE Mount is designed to secure optimizers and microinverters along the underside of the module frame at desired locations. According to S-5!, this simplifies wire management and electrically bonds the equipment together to comply with grounding requirements.
The MLPE Mount can be used with most solar modules as well as with all S-5!’s solar attachments, including in rail-based installations or paired with the PVKIT rail-less solar mounting solution for direct attachment to metal roofs, S-5! reports. A tab feature makes it less likely for the mount to rotate during installation, enabling one hand to position the MLPE device on the frame, while the other hand tightens the bolt to secure it.
“We were looking for a simple and cost-effective way to quickly secure optimizers and microinverters to PV frames for rail-less solar installations,” said Ricardo Barroso, director of research and development at S-5! “With its unique teeth and tab design, S-5!’s MLPE Mount secures MLPE devices to module frames with ease without rotation; then penetrates anodization layers and embeds into the frame for superior grip, electric bonding, and grounding (earthing).”
The MLPE Mount, which is UL2703-certified, is designed for solar developers, EPCs, installers and end-users who are looking for an MLPE mounting device for solar module frames, without attaching to rails.
S-5! is exhibiting this week at Intersolar in booth 3027.

The proposed system utilizes two current comparators, two NPN transistors, and a current mirror circuit. These devices are integrated through an automatic switching mechanism, which the scientists said eliminates the need for conventional bypass diodes, as it provides a dynamic response to fluctuating thermal conditions.
In the proposed system configuration, the current comparator identifies anomalies in the current flow indicative of potential hotspots, while the current mirror circuit reacts to these anomalies by gauging the current flow. “This design allows for precise control of the input and output current via a purely resistive element, promoting a more stable and efficient operational environment for the PV module,” the researchers explained.
The current comparator operates in two stages. First, it assesses output currents from the first and second PV sub-strings. Then it juxtaposes the differential current obtained from this assessment with the last PV sub-string. The final step is described by the researchers as the critical passage ensuring homogeneous current across all sub-strings, which they said prevents the occurrence of hotspots.

The electronic circuit can operate by sourcing electricity from the solar modules themselves and, according to its creators, its energy consumption is minimal.
Through a series of validation tests exposing the circuit to high current loads, the research group found that it could ensure sufficient thermal stability within safe operating limits. “This robust performance indicates the circuit's suitability for a broad range of PV installations, from small-scale residential to large-scale industrial applications,” it explained, noting that the device lowered hotspot temperatures “significantly” from the “dangerous” 55 C threshold.
The scientists also found that using the system may result in a higher energy yield ranging from 3% to 5.35% in solar panels affected by adjacent and non-adjacent hotspots. However, they also warned that, although the system ensures a more uniform distribution of current, it is not able to correct the power losses at the site of defects.
“While the circuit significantly reduced hotspot temperatures, bringing them closer to those of healthy cells, it did not entirely normalize them,” they concluded, hinting at the current limitations of the device.
It was described in the paper “Photovoltaic hotspots: a mitigation technique and its thermal cycle,” which was recently published in Optik. The research team included scientists from the University of York in the United Kingdom, the US Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories, and the University of Naples Federico II in Italy.

Terra-Gen and Mortenson have announced the activation of the Edwards & Sanborn Solar + Energy Storage project, the largest solar-plus-storage project in the United States. Mortenson served as engineering, procurement, and construction contractor for the project. 
The project is a true renewable energy behemoth, spanning 4,600 acres, comprised of 1.9 million US-made First Solar panels. It holds a capacity of 875 MWdc solar, and nearly 3.3 GWh of energy storage. It has a 1.3 GW interconnection capacity. 
California’s grid is expected to receive enough electricity to power the equivalent of about 238,000 homes from the project. This leads to an estimated 320,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions abated annually. 
The energy storage is made up of LG Chem, Samsung, and BYD batteries. This feat of engineering required 98 miles of MV Wire, over 361 miles of DC wiring, and 120,720 batteries. 
Edwards & Sanborn is partially located on the Edwards Air Force Base in Kern County, California, a hub for many of the largest solar projects in the United Staes. It represents the largest public-private collaboration in US Department of Defense history. Since 2020, more than 1,000 craftworkers contributed to the project, and it was executed with more than a million hours of injury-free labor.
“Only in America can we take barren land, embrace the power of the sun, and create an engineering marvel,” said Brigadier General William Kale, Air Force civil engineer center commander. “So, take the time to reflect, see the great work that was done, and understand the significance of this project and what it can lead to. Hopefully, this is just the spark.”
The active project supplies power to the city of San Jose, Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric, the Clean Power Alliance, and Starbucks corporation, among others.
The project’s first phase added 346 MWac of solar modules and 1.5 GWh of battery storage. Financing for the the first phase was closed in 2021 and included $804 million senior secured credit facilities. This includes $400 million construction and term loan facility, a $328 million tax equity bridge facility, and a $76 million construction and revolving letter of credit facility. J.P. Morgan is providing the tax equity commitment for the initial phase of the project, with Deutsche Bank leading the construction and term financing.
In 2022, Terra-Gen closed a nearly $1 billion project financing for the second phase of the project. It included $460 million construction and term loan facility, $96 million construction and revolving credit facility, and a $403 million tax equity bridge facility. BNP Paribas, CoBank, U.S. Bank, ING, and Nomura led the funding.
In total, the two financing rounds for the project totaled more than $1.7 billion.

Germany deployed 14.28 GW of new PV systems in 2023, according to the latest statistics released by the country's Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur).
Germany's new PV additions reached 7.19 GW in 2022, 5.26 GW in 2021, 3.94 GW in 2019, 2.96 GW in 2018, and 1.75 GW in 2017. At the end of December 2023, around 3.67 million PV systems were operating in Germany with a combined capacity of 81.3 GW.
The Bundesnetzagentur said that new PV additions for December totaled about 880 MW, which represents the worst performance registered for the whole of 2023. This is a significant monthly drop from October and November, when new capacity reached 1.37 GW and 1.25 GW, respectively.
Around 422.2 MW of the capacity deployed in November comes from PV systems up to 1 MW in size, operating under the country's subsidy scheme.
About 109 MW of PV projects, awarded in Germany's auctions, went online in December. However, this figure is considerably lower than those registered in October and November, when 538 MW and 390 MW were installed, respectively.
The statistics also show that a total of 5,993 solar systems with an output of 21.2 MW were dismantled last year. Most of them were in North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria.

The company attributed the decision to soaring production costs, triggered by the closure of the US and Indian markets to Chinese solar panels. This led to a surplus in the European market, causing a drop of more than 50% in module sales prices, adversely affecting its business, despite its niche market focus.
“This resulted in negative margins and the standstill of new home construction in Europe, our main market, reinforced this negative impact,” said the manufacturer.
The company said it secured an unspecified amount of funds last year from the Netherlands' National Growth Fund (NGF), in partnership with Dutch consortium SolarNL.
“Despite this subsidy, the persistent bottom prices of Chinese solar panels make it difficult to realize these plans,” it said. 
The company currently employs 24 people and operates a factory in The Hague. In 2015, Exasun launched commercial operations with its first pilot production line for black glass modules at the manufacturing facility, as it secured funds in 2012.

Digital twins are used in engineering science to define digital counterparts of existing physical assets. They are conceptually different from multi-scale simulations and are commonly used to assess the physical assets' current and future state via real-time sensors and physical models.
“We attempt to connect high-throughout experimentation and theory,” the research's corresponding author, Ian Marius Peters, told pv magazine. “The particular digital twin that we envision goes beyond a mere representation of the experimental infrastructure we have, it becomes itself a part of it. The challenge we want to tackle is to devise entirely new materials for photovoltaic applications, from the molecular design all the way to the integrated solar cell. To achieve this, we must be able to quickly sort through many different molecules, processing conditions, layer stacks and operating conditions.”
According to Peters, the key is combining high-throughput (HT) experimentation and theoretical modeling. “Mathematically, this becomes an optimization over several connected processes with different time- and length scales,” he went on to say. “The digital twin now is a combination of various models and optimization routines such as Bayesian optimization and Gaussian process regression. These are fed with experimental data at the different stages to allow this optimization.” 
This tool is being conceived to allow researchers and manufacturers an information flow across all stages. “For example, if we want to have a material that is intrinsically recyclable with a  certain process, we feed this information into the digital twin, which allows us to start the design process of the molecules with the boundary conditions provided by the need to facilitate this recycling,” Peters added.
In the study “A digital twin to overcome long-time challenges in photovoltaics,” published in Joule, Peters and his colleagues explained that innovations are often found in photovoltaic research through “serendipity” and said disruptive discoveries will be less frequent in the future. The proposed digital twin is expected to help increase the number of discoveries by reducing the gap between first-principles calculations and experiments, as it enables “informed” decision-making without direct information on a given asset.
The most important features of the proposed digital twin are redundancy rejection, uncertainty quantification, and real-time prediction. It relies on the materials acceleration platforms (MAPs), which divide the experimental space into molecules, films, and devices, and also utilizes.
“The digital twin aims at attaining inverse molecular and process design capacity to discover design principles and new materials with unseen properties, matching currently contradicting requirements,” the research group explained. “The digital twin will allow us to exploit HT, capable, and fast proxy experiments, using cascading surrogates to predict properties across scales and extracting optimized solutions.”
Looking forward, the scientists said merging across labs and scales will be crucial to improve data validation and parametrization of first-principle modeling, respectively. Furthermore, they want to establish optimized processes for material designs. “By enhancing the digital twin’s ability to optimize under uncertain conditions, we can ensure that it is capable of leveraging knowledge while also delivering efficient and reliable solutions for designing high-quality materials,” they concluded.

Called MSAN8-Y Mini VRF, the new product uses DC inverter technology for both the compressor and fan motor and a plate heat exchanger as a secondary intercooler to boost refrigerant subcooling. “Using a plate heat exchanger as a secondary intercooler can increase refrigerant subcooling by up to 15 C, thereby improving heat exchange and energy efficiency,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The new series has an output of 7.2 kW to 15.5 kW. It has dimensions of 1,038 mm x 864 mm x 523 mm and a weight ranging from 80 kg to 109 kg, depending on the capacity.
The manufacturer ensures that the power consumption in standby mode is reduced to as low as 3.5 W and said its seasonal coefficient of performance (SCOP) spans from 3.80 to 4.80. It can reportedly operate from -15 C up to 52 C in cooling mode and from -20 C to 30 C in heating mode.
The heat pump has a sound power level ranging from 70 dB(A) to 74 dB(A) and an airflow rate of up to 5,200 m3/h. A refrigerant printed circuit board (PCB) technology is used to cool the electric control box, which purportedly decreases the average temperature of electrical control components by around 8 C, according to the manufacturer.
“The MSAN8-Y Mini VRF replaces equivalent sizes of the current Mini VRF MSAN-XMi series, represents the first step of the new V8 platform introduction, presenting significant technological improvements and new functionalities,” the company said. “Designed with a single single-fan chassis for all sizes, the new series also offers remarkable benefits throughout the entire lifecycle, from the installation to the maintenance and use. Additional optional safety devices, such as the R32 refrigerant leak sensor and the Shut-off valve, complete the offer.”
Clivet is headquartered in Feltre, in the Italian northern province of Belluno. It also produces boilers, chillers, and air-handling units.
