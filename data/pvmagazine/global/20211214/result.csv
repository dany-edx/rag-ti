The news service has run an article based on an interview with Wang Yingge, deputy general manager of Longi’s hydrogen energy technology unit. Longi reportedly plans to build 1.5 GW of production capacity of electrolyzers next year, up from 500 MW today, to account for more than 60% of global electrolyzer installations next year. The Bloomberg article emphasized, however, Chinese companies are lacking the public support they received to trigger the nation's solar and wind industries.
U.S.-based Air Products has awarded Germany's Thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers a contract to supply a more than 2 GW electrolysis plant for a green hydrogen project at Saudi Arabia’s new city, Neom. “Under this contract, Thyssenkrupp will engineer, procure and fabricate the plant based on their large scale, 20 MW alkaline water electrolysis module,” the German business said yesterday. “Upon commissioning, the project partners – Neom, [Saudi energy company] ACWA Power, and Air Products – will operate the facility, which will produce hydrogen to be synthesized into carbon-free ammonia for export exclusively by Air Products to global markets.” The start of production is scheduled for 2026. “With our large scale standard module size and gigawatt cell manufacturing capacity per year, together with our joint venture partner [Italian sustainable energy company] De Nora we are able to deliver large-capacity projects today,” said Denis Krude, CEO of Thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers.
U.K.-based green hydrogen energy company Protium has announced it will deploy its first 100 kW electrolyzer in the U.K. by April. The electrolyzer will be sourced from German manufacturer Enapter. “Dubbed project pioneer, the project will see Protium deploy the Enapter Electrolyser 2.1 which will be the largest integrated Enapter electrolyser in the field in the U.K.,” wrote Protium today, adding the generation of electrolytic hydrogen at scale will happen at Cardiff University’s newly established Hydrogen Propulsion Centre, in South Wales. Protium recently announced £2.65 million (€3.1 million) funding to decarbonize operations at the Bruichladdich distillery, on the Hebridean island of Islay. The company is also working on a 40 GW project in Teesside, England by 2026.
Australian green energy company Port Anthony Renewables’ oversubscribed capital raising exercise has put a fresh AU$3 million [€1.9 million] directly into its commercial scale hydrogen precinct ahead of a planned Australian Securities Exchange listing next year. “The investor enthusiasm not only highlights excitement around the strategy at Port Anthony but the growing, global interest in hydrogen – especially green hydrogen – as the clean fuel of the future,” Port Anthony wrote yesterday. “The company had originally sought to raise [AU]$2.5 million but subscriptions totaled some [AU]$6 million just 48 hours after launching the cap[ital] raise.” Port Anthony is developing a commercial scale green hydrogen manufacturing and export hub less than 200km east of Melbourne and 78km from the Gippsland Basin natural gas pipeline network which carries domestic gas as well as fuel for export. Australian hydrogen companies, including Aviation H2, are seeking to raise capital. Several listings of Australian hydrogen companies are planned for 2022.
Netherlands-based chemicals producer Nobian and Australian multinational Macquarie’s Green Investment Group (GIG) are joining forces to form the Hydrogen Chemistry Company (HyCC). “Through this partnership, the companies are taking a unique step by creating a company that is specialized in water electrolysis to produce green hydrogen from renewable power at an industrial scale,” wrote GIG today. “With Nobian’s experience in large scale electrolysis and GIG’s resources and project development experience, HyCC will be able to accelerate investments and the development of more large scale projects.” HyCC will launch with a pipeline of more than 400 MW of electrolysis projects. The biggest is in Rotterdam, to replace fossil-fuel-powered hydrogen. GIG and Nobian will each have a 50% share in HyCC. The deal is expected to close in March.

The new investment round will be the third of the so-called “cap and floor” regime and will be aimed at doubling existing interconnector capacity by 2030, a target Ofgem wants to synchronize with the goal of quadrupling offshore wind capacity by the end of the decade.
“Project developers and consumers will benefit from Ofgem’s ‘cap and floor' regime,” the authority said in a statement. “This sets a maximum ‘cap’ on revenues and a minimum ‘floor,’ to ensure an adequate return for investors while keeping costs down for consumers.”
More details were provided on which locations should be interconnected and on the neighboring countries the interconnectors may be linked to. Ofgem said, however, that multiple-purpose interconnectors for offshore wind farm clusters will be tendered for the first time.

The planned interconnectors are expected to generate revenue in the wholesale market from congestion revenues, which depend on the existence of price differences between markets at either end of the interconnector. These revenues reflect transportation costs equal to the difference between what customers pay, and generators receive, for transported energy.
In the previous two rounds of the scheme, held in 2014 and 2018, Ofgem contracted around 8.5 GW of transmission capacity that is now under development or construction.
Currently, Britain has an electricity interconnector capacity of 7.5 GW that comes from six projects: the 1 GW BritNed cable (to the Netherlands); the 1 GW Nemo Link (to Belgium); the 500 MW Moyle project (to Northern Ireland); the 500 MW East West interconnector (to Ireland); the 2 GW IFA interconnector (to France); and the 1.4 GW North Sea Link (to Norway).
*The article was updated on December 16 to add the 2 GW IFA interconnector to the list of the existing subsea cables.

Clean energy division Shell New Energies announced the move today in a press release issued on the Cision PR platform, but did not specify how much the acquisition will cost or how the deal will be structured.
The Anglo-Dutch energy business will buy Savion from the Green Investment Group owned by Australian investor Macquarie.
Shell said its planned new subsidiary boasts a pipeline running to more than 18 GW of solar power generation and energy storage projects across more than 100 projects in 26 U.S. states.
Quoted in today's statement, Wael Sawan, integrated gas and renewables & energy solutions director for Shell, said: “Savion's significant asset pipeline, highly experienced team, and proven success as a renewable energy project developer make it a compelling fit for Shell's growing integrated power business.”
Shell in October announced it wants to halve its CO2 emissions – compared to its 2016 performance – this decade, including the removal of emissions from all its owned or controlled assets and from electricity it purchases. The company in February announced a plan to attain net zero carbon operations by mid century.

The company's containerized Release by Scatec system will be installed in Maroua, the regional capital of the nation's Far North area, and in the city of Guider, near the border with Chad, where Scatec has also announced it will add solar capacity.
In Cameroon, the 36 MW of solar generation capacity and 20 MW/19 MWh of battery storage that will be added at the two sites will be leased to power company ENEO, which is controlled by London-based investor Actis and in which the Cameroon government holds a 44% stake.
pv magazine is holding a webinar on Thursday to consider the advances and future potential of agrivoltaic systems. Join Becky Beetz and our partner Soltec to find out more from 5 p.m. (CET) on Thursday. You can register for the From Sun to Fork, Circular Agrivoltaics event here.
Scatec said, in a press release about its latest African plans released yesterday, the International Finance Corp (IFC) private-sector arm of the World Bank would pay 10-20% of the total project costs for the two Cameroon sites. Scatec did not state the total costs nor the criteria which would determine how much the IFC will contribute.
Raymond Carlsen, chief executive of the clean power developer, said the shipping container based power systems would provide reliable electricity in a region where hydroelectricity supplies are being affected by drought.
The developer said power will start flowing from the first of its Release by Scatec installations “around year-end 2021,” with further phases leading up to completion of the projects by the middle of next year.
The company also said it will install 7.7 MWp of solar generation capacity across five mini-grids in Chad. Those networks, which Scatec said would supply power to 300,000 people in five provincial cities, will be up and running next year.
The solar plants are being installed for private Chadian power company ZIZ Energie, which is financed by the Energy Access Ventures fund backed by public money from the U.K., France, and the Netherlands; EU lender the European Investment Bank; the governments of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; and French electrical business Schneider Electric.

The manufacturing facility will have an annual capacity of 20 GW and will produce n-type large-size wafers. The total investment is estimated to be around RMB6.56 billion (US$1.03 billion). Dong Xingxue, former CEO of solar manufacturer LDK Solar, will be chairman of the company and will lead the management team.
China's largest polysilicon manufacturer,Tongwei, has announced its factory in Yunnan has successfully commissioned new production capacity of 50,000 metric tons. With the additional output, the company's total polysilicon production capacity has reached 180,000MT. According to Tongwei’s official website, the company has three main production bases for polysilicon manufacturing: in Leshan, Sichuan province; in Baoshan, Yunnan; and in Baotou, Inner Mongolia. The company plans to further increase capacity to 330,000MT and 430,000MT next year and in 2023, respectively.
China’s largest silicon metal and silicone producer, Hoshine Silicon, has signed an agreement with the government of Urumqi City, in Xinjiang autonomous region, for the construction of a vertically integrated solar module factory. It wants to invest around RMB35.5 billion (US$5.58 billion) in the project with construction scheduled to start in March.
State-controlled solar panel glassmaker Irico New Energy has fleshed out the capital costs of its planned expansion in production capacity ahead of a vote to back new purchasing agreements from sister companies. Irico Group New Energy Co Ltd plans to approve up to RMB160 million (US$25.1 million) spending on packaging, unspecified PV-business raw materials, and other services next year from the wider, state-owned Irico Group Co Ltd which owns 34% of the glassmaker. That figure will rise to RMB186 million (US$29.2 million) in 2023 and RMB191 million (US$30 million) in 2024, providing independent shareholders back the plan, on December 31. A second purchasing agreement concerns property investment unit Xianyang Zhongdian Irico Group Holdings Ltd, which is 72% held by state-owned Irico parent China Electronics Co, and 28% by Irico Group Co. Under that arrangement, the glassmaker would spend up to RMB185 million next year, including RMB119 million (US$18.7 million) on new production lines; rising to RMB246 million (US$38.6 million) in 2023; and RMB234 million (US$36.8 million) in 2024, as the manufacturing facility spend changes to RMB90 million and RMB 26 million (US$4.08 million), respectively. Under the second arrangement, the raw materials to be supplied were specified as coating solution, ink and thinner.

The device is intended for applications in solar windows and, according to its creators, may easily reach commercial production as the low–temperature, two–step manufacturing process they developed is compatible with existing window glass manufacturing technology.
The process consists of manufacturing semi-transparent and oxide-free thin films of crystalline Sb2S3 through ultrasonic chemical spray pyrolysis (USP), which is an alternative to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for the preparation of micro or nano-thin films. “Considering the potential benefits of the capability of ultrasonic spray pyrolysis for large scale production, extensive cost savings could be achieved by depositing all component layers in the Sb2S3-solar cell by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis, further accentuating facile integration in solar window glass production,” the research corresponding author, Malle Krunks, told pv magazine.
The device was built on a substrate made of glass, an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, titanium dioxide (TiO₂), with the Sb2S3 layer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a hole transport layer (HTL), and a gold (Au) metal contact. Sb2S3 films with thicknesses of 30, 70, 100, and 150nm were tested to find the optimal size and the cells made with 70nm films achieved the best fill factor, of around 57%, while the highest power conversion efficiencies were achieved with films ranging from 70 to 100nm.

A cell with a 1.7mm2 area achieved an efficiency of 5.5% and another device with a 7.1mm2 cell area reached 4.7%. Both values are described by the scientists as top performances in the last five years, and close to the record efficiencies of planar solar cells based on pristine Sb2S3.
This remarkable result was achieved, they went on to say, thanks to the optical spacer effect, which usually occurs in solar cells with a very thin HTL and absorber. “The optical spacer effect can have a strong influence on the efficiency when the thickness of the absorber is around 100nm or less,” the academics specified. “Holes photogenerated near the electron‐transporting material/Sb2S3 interface, which must travel the farthest towards the HTL, face mobility issues when traversing the thickest (150nm) absorber layer.”
The cell also showed average visible transparency of 26%.
“It is a bit difficult to compare the cost due to the fact that one needs to account for the scaling up of the fabrication process and that is a bit cumbersome to forecast precisely but, based on the current cost of material and processes involved, and assuming an efficiency of 5%, I expect a price that is between $550 and $650/kW,” researcher Matteo Chiese stated when asked about the cell costs. “This is quite comparable with the rooftop PV module cost in Germany for the fourth quarter of 2019 – $500/kW. If we manage to reach an efficiency of 6% we are going below the 2019 module cost per kilowatt published by Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE.”
The solar cell architecture was unveiled in the paper Semitransparent Sb2S3 thin film solar cells by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis for use in solar windows, published in The Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology. The research team includes scientists from the Tallinn University of Technology, in Estonia; the University of Nevada, in the United States; and Germany's Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).

Scottish company Smarter Grid Solutions was tasked by Spanish-owned electric utility Avangrid with accommodating an extra 2.6 MW of solar generation capacity into the latter's network in Spencerport after three 5 MW solar farms applied for grid permits.
Get the latest edition of pv magazine today to read about the kinks in the global supply chain which, like the mixed-bag outcome of COP26, have kept a significant portion of this year’s progress tangled up. We find more to celebrate than condemn, however, for 2021 was another record year for solar installations, and the forecasts for 2022 look even more promising.
The energy software company's Flexible Interconnect Capacity Solution (FICS), which has been successfully deployed on U.K. grids, ended up being able to accommodate all 15 MW of extra solar capacity which would otherwise have been unable to be hosted on the distribution system.
And with the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) having predicted the FICS software could have the potential to treble the capacity of grid networks without any need for costly infrastructure investment, Smarter Grid Solutions is hoping the success achieved by its distributed-energy resource management system (DERMS) in the U.K. can be rolled out worldwide.
Graham Ault, of Smarter Grid Solutions, explained how the real-time electricity flow management system is already helping to integrate more than 400 MW of renewable energy generation capacity into grids which would otherwise have been deemed as having no free capacity.
“The FICS solution works in the same way as traffic lights and speed controls on public roads,” said Ault. “You can avoid building lots more roads and still achieve the maximum throughput of vehicles if you regulate the flow of traffic with smarter approaches like dynamic use of extra lanes, dynamic speed limits and traffic lights. That’s how the saving in grid infrastructure investment works – making the most out of existing infrastructure by monitoring traffic flows and deciding when to apply the different controls.
“The SGS software monitors the flow of power in the grid and compares that to grid capacity – like monitoring flowing and standing [or] jammed vehicles on roads – the sources of … problems. For the grid that’s the solar generators that are exporting at high power; on roads that’s … side roads, lanes, etc. [FICS] then [issues] signals to make everything flow better. For FICS, that takes the form of an instruction to a PV site to regulate the export of power upwards or downwards.
“Achieving a solution that achieves that on a second by second basis, 365 days a year is quite complex but our system now manages over 400 MW of renewable generation for grid operators with excellent results.”

Mondragon Assembly, a Spanish PV production equipment supplier, has developed a new tabber and stringer ECA machine for the interconnection of heterojunction (HJT) solar cells.
It developed the new production tool in partnership with France's National Solar Energy Institute (INES), a unit of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).
The machine can purportedly produce 2,600 HTJ cells per hour. The company says it offers better performance in terms of conversion efficiency, loss reduction, and commercial competitiveness.
It handles independent printing for the two sides of the cell and can manufacture strings of up to 15 busbars ,with cell sizes up to M 12 (210 mm). In addition, it can handle thin cells of up to 110 µm. It is also compatible with gapless and paving technologies.
“Thanks to the multiple vision controls it has been fitted with, this new machine guarantees the precision and quality of the manufactured strings, which allows to increase the efficiency of the machine and obtain better manufacturing results in less time,” the Spanish company said.
Mondragon Assembly is currently developing a welding solution for HJT. It is known that HJT cells cannot withstand very high temperatures, but the equipment manufacturer aims to offer related solutions in the future.

“Grid capacity has already been greatly expanded by installing more transmission lines and transformer stations … however, that is not fast enough, as solar parks, for example, are being built faster than grid operators can build,” the association said in a statement.
Netbeheer Nederland stressed that the map's colored areas are those with the highest grid congestion levels. That does not mean, however, that grid issues will not be present in the non-colored areas and renewable energy project developers in those areas should not expect a guarantee of immediate grid availability.
“The network operators are making an urgent appeal to the future cabinet to speed up the processing times for permits and to make clear choices about which parties should be given priority and at which locations,” the association stated, noting that the current rule is prioritizing projects on a first-come, first-served basis.
Dutch electricity transmission system operator (TSO) Tennet recently developed an interactive online map showing the locations in the country where the power grid is most congested. Tennet specified that this map will be updated on a quarterly basis and that changes may occur if additional capacity becomes available due to an expansion of infrastructure or if a station has reached its maximum capacity due to new grid-connection requests.
In November 2020, Netbeheer Nederland and the Dutch renewable energy associations De Nederlandse Vereniging Duurzame Energie (NVDE) and Holland Solar signed a preliminary agreement to ensure faster and cheaper grid connection of large scale solar power plants, in an effort to reduce pressure on the network.

Grid-stabilizing devices connecting renewables to distributed energy resources,"Synchroinverters are a special kind of smart inverter that mimics a synchronous generator and are able to avoid grid voltage frequency fluctuations and faults by responding dynamically and autonomously to changes in the grid by software means, and providing an inertial response in an extremely short time. These devices have been developed mostly at the research level to date and are considered an optimal solution for integrating renewable energy with distributed energy resources such as storage and electric vehicles.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Israel’s Ministry of Energy (MoE) announced they have agreed to support, through the Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) Energy program, a consortium formed by Israeli software provider Synvertec and U.S.-based power conversion and energy management systems provider Rhombus Energy Solutions to develop a new synchroinverter, which the DOE described as a dynamic and autonomous inverter utilizing a unique control algorithm, allowing 100% of renewable generation by providing grid stability solutions for inverter-based applications.
“These new inverters are totally autonomous but can also respond to direct commands from the grid operator, when necessary,” a spokesperson from Rhombus Energy Solutions told pv magazine. “The solution is highly scalable, with the synchroinverter able to control inverters ranging in size from kilowatts to megawatts.”
According to the company, the devices are interoperable among themselves without compromising the expected performance of each of them separately and are able to provide grid stability services in less than 16.67 milliseconds. “The inverter will react to any changes in the grid in the same way a generator would; just much faster, in a cost-effective way, and [they] thereby play an active role in grid stability,” the spokesperson went on to say. “It is important to stress that the provision of frequency and voltage support is done simultaneously.”
The new inverter technology will rely on an agnostic algorithm developed by Synvertec that can be embedded into any three-phase inverter. The algorithm will be integrated into Rhombus Energy Solutions' 125 kW bi-directional inverter, which the manufacturer describes as a device that can support power flow to and from the grid, allowing integration with power storage and non-grid renewable power resources. The device can be used either as a grid-tied, utility-interactive inverter or as a PV inverter.
The 125 kW-inverter is currently used by the company in the RES–DCVC125–480 EV DC Fast Charging unit developed by Rhombus. During grid-tied operation, the inverter's site circuit breaker is closed and, when the battery is in discharge mode, the inverter injects current into the grid and supports critical loads. During standalone operation, the smart communication board is opened and the inverter, along with a battery, maintains power to critical loads.
The inverter also features an integrated standalone cooling unit, DC over-current protection, DC over-voltage protection, grid failure detection and protection, AC overcurrent protection, enclosures for over-temperature warning and under-temperature handling, and a hardware thermal protection circuit. “The 125 kW platform is a mass-production unit deployed across the USA and Canada and has a proven track record,” the company stated. “At its core, the switching power stage has been in production for more than 20 years and there are hundreds of units deployed in various configurations that are still in operation.”

The Northern Territory government has granted “Major Project Status” to “water-from-air” technology company Aqua Aerem to develop its AUD 15 billion ($10.7 billion), 10 GW Desert Bloom Hydrogen project in Tennant Creek, Northern Territory, with ambitious plans for commercial production by 2023.
Around the world, large-scale green hydrogen projects are being touted for highly irradiated regions looking to use solar resources for the future green hydrogen economy. However, it is often the case that highly sunny places are also places of high water scarcity. And this is exactly the hurdle that Desert Bloom could avoid.
According to Aqua Aerem, for every 1 kg of hydrogen produced, 9 liters of water are required. Aqua Aerem’s patented proprietary technology captures water from the atmosphere in arid environments using off-grid solar energy, with no waste other than air. This commercial quantity of water can then be used in solar electrolysis, with water split into its constituent parts, namely hydrogen and oxygen.
Aqua Aerem CEO Gerard Reiter said the project was “transformative” in the way it managed to overcome water supply and solar/electrolysis integration problems that have thus far held back global renewable hydrogen production.
“With today’s announcement, the pathway for green hydrogen becomes a reality,” said Reiter. “Our air-to-water technology, which solves this previously intractable water supply problem, is a world first; invented and developed here in Australia. This technology will open the door for green hydrogen projects to be located where the best renewable power sources are available, which is generally in the driest areas of the planet.”
From March, the company ran a 12-week pilot project at just such a dry area, Tennant Creek, close to existing gas pipeline infrastructure. It is now moving to a commercial construction phase in 2022, with plans to produce approximately 410,000 tons of green hydrogen annually by 2027 at a price point below $2/kg.
Like other large-scale green hydrogen projects, Desert Bloom is being planned as a series of interconnected modular and portable systems, in this case, 2 MW hydrogen production units (HPUs) that will each generate water, heat, electricity, and of course hydrogen. If everything goes according to plan Desert Bloom will comprise around 4,000 HPUs.
According to a statement, Aqua Aerem’s majority owner, Sanguine Impact Investment, will be providing the capital for the project, and already has agreements with a large unnamed Japanese gas buyer and NT power utility Territory Generation.
“The project has multiple competitive advantages,” Reiter continued. “It uses proven technology and has its own water supply. It benefits from the world’s best solar resources, does not require large sunk costs before it begins producing, and it is located at the ‘energy corridor’ of rail, road and gas pipeline infrastructure linking directly to Darwin Port. It also offers the most direct, cost-effective route to Asian export markets.”
For these reasons, Reiter believes the project will reach the US$2/kilogram hydrogen goal, the closest project outlook yet to Australia’s National Hydrogen Strategy target of $2/kilogram.
Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner said the development of projects such as Desert Bloom Hydrogen would see the territory play a leading role in the emerging renewable hydrogen market.
“Being the ‘comeback capital’ means diversifying the projects we have in the Territory – and Desert Bloom now marks the territory’s 14th major project that’s in the works,” said Gunner. “Territorians will see the benefits on the ground in Central Australia and in the Top End with around 1,000 jobs and AUD 1 billion a year in export revenue from this project alone – it’s good news for the territory.”
“Desert Bloom Hydrogen technology provides an innovative approach to secure a sustainable water supply, which is an essential in the development of renewable hydrogen and will be particularly valuable in arid areas,” said NT Minister for Renewables and Energy Eva Lawler.
Major Project Commissioner Jason Schoolmeester also noted the potential of Desert Bloom to supply renewable power to regional industries “including mining and agribusinesses.” Schoolmeester said it “will provide a competitive advantage in a world that is increasingly focused n sustainable supply chains.”

The U.S. grid is a network of power generation plants, transformers, wires, sensors, and poles that carry electricity far and wide. When we have power, we don’t give the grid much thought. But that is now changing.
Much of the nation’s grid is old, with the average age of power plants being over 30 years old – most transmission lines and transformers are more than 25 years old. In that time period, much new technology has been added to the grid, including solar and energy storage.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is serious about the potential threat of cyberattacks on the nation's energy resources. In a speech to the Department of State in early February, President Joe Biden announced an “urgent initiative” to improve U.S. capabilities, readiness and resilience in cyberspace.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) is continuing its efforts to shore up the solar industry’s resilience against cybersecurity threats. Recently, SEIA and the Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) hosted a half-day virtual summit on the state of cybersecurity in the industry, with an emphasis on how these threats must be taken into account from the initial design phase.
SEIA advises that it is more cost-effective to mitigate risks now than to pay the price after the fact by taking just a few, simple, low-cost steps for businesses to take to strengthen their cybersecurity and prevent future attacks. Such measures include password protection solutions, multi-factor authentication, and keeping software up to date.
SEIA also advises companies to actively implement strong data governance strategies. Information can fall into the wrong hands if it isn’t handled properly, and it is recommended that companies dispose of older, unnecessary data. Tips for small business security can be found in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) cybersecurity toolkit.
What is needed is an industry-wide approach. SunSpec and the Sandia National Laboratories lead a distributed energy resource (DER) Cybersecurity Workgroup to create an industry standard for cybersecurity from the competing frameworks. Interested companies can join the working group to contribute to the development of these critical industry standards and best practices.
Clean energy companies can join a public-private partnership to work together with other businesses and the government to identify vulnerabilities, triage cyber issues, and develop scalable solutions to secure the grid. The Department of Energy’s Cyber Testing for Resilient Industrial Control Systems (CyTRICS) is one such partnership between many of the national labs and private businesses.
