The change will take effect from the next CfD auction, which is planned to be held in March next year.
The decision, announced by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) on Wednesday, contained few details of what form future auctions will take but it was welcomed by UK renewables umbrella trade body the Association for Renewable Energy and Clean Technology.

Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.

The association's policy director, Frank Gordon said: “We and others have called for more frequent auctions for a number of years, most recently in response to the energy bills crisis. More power will be needed as sectors decarbonize and moving to renewable, domestic energy supplies is ultimately the only way to prevent us being exposed to volatile international fossil fuel prices that drive bill increases, while enabling [a] net zero [economy].”
Under the CfD bidding rules, clean power generators agree a strike price, via auction, which determines the income they will receive from the sale of the electricity they generate. The power is sold on the day-ahead wholesale market and when the market price is below the agreed strike price, the government makes good the difference. When power prices are above the strike price, generators bank the receipts before returning the difference to the government.
Quoted in the BEIS announcement heralding the change in frequency of the auctions, Dan McGrail, chief executive of wind and tidal power trade body RenewableUK, said: “Moving to annual CfD auctions is a major step forward which will significantly accelerate the speed of our nation’s transition to net zero. It’s good news for consumers too, as it means the UK will be reducing its vulnerability to volatile international gas prices and increasing the volumes of low cost renewable energy in our energy system. There’s a huge appetite among renewable energy developers to invest in building more projects, which will help to grow the UK supply chain at a faster rate. This will enable us to maximize the economic benefits which this sector offers to everyone, especially in parts of the country which urgently need leveling up.
“We need [to] build up to 4GW of new offshore wind capacity every year to stay on track for net zero, which means quadrupling our current annual rate. Similar increases in onshore wind, solar and other clean power sources are vital too, as well as ramping up the roll-out of innovative technologies like floating wind, green hydrogen and marine power.”
Solar and onshore wind were ineligible for CfD auction incentive support between 2015 and the latest round, where they have been readmitted, although only £10 million (€11.9 million) of the £285 million (€341 million) budget for the procurement round has been allocated for the mature technologies.
The government held a fact-finding exercise a year ago which potentially foreshadows a tapering down of subsidy support for CfD-backed projects, with industry opinion sought on proposals including reducing the length of CfD payment contracts, whether extending and repowering projects should qualify for subsidy, and whether the auctions should be used to nudge clean power projects to less advantaged parts of the UK.

The pipeline has a capacity of 10-12GW so it is already suitable for the further roll-out of green hydrogen production to [a] gigawatt scale in the North Sea.” The partners said they intend to start a feasibility study in the second quarter. The companies will also proceed with “an accessible knowledge platform.” The details of a second stage of the project have yet to be finalized, with the partners adding: “For that phase, a tender methodology has yet to be defined.”
Researchers at the RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science (CSRS), in Japan, have published a paper on a “new sustainable and practical method” for producing electrolyzers using cobalt and manganese. The team, led by Ryuhei Nakamura, wrote that the new catalyst does not require platinum and iridium and focuses on a combination of active cobalt oxides and stable manganese oxides to avoid physical decomposition. “The team overcame these issues by trial and error and discovered an active and stable catalyst by inserting manganese into the spinel lattice of Co3O4, producing the mixed cobalt manganese oxide Co2MnO4,” read a study published in Nature Catalysis. According to the researchers, Co2MnO4’s activation levels were close to those of state-of-the-art iridium oxides. “Additionally, the new catalyst lasted over two months at a current density of 200mA/cm2, which could make it effective for practical use. Compared with other non-rare metal catalysts, which typically last only days or weeks at much lower current densities, the new electrocatalyst could be a game changer.” The team will now work on ways to extend the lifetime of the catalyst and increase its activity levels. 

Dutch data center company NorthC has said its Groningen facility will install a 500kW hydrogen cell module that runs on green hydrogen, becoming the first data center in Europe to do so. “The hydrogen cells in Groningen are expected to be operational by the middle of June,” the company wrote on its website, highlighting a partnership with Dutch polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell company Nedstack. The project will help NorthC investigate whether the hydrogen tech can replace emergency diesel generators at its other data centers, to achieve climate-neutral operations by 2030 as agreed by the European data center sector. NorthC is also considering running its existing generators on hydrogen. As demand for data center services increases, companies are studying other circular economy solutions such as using their residual heat to warm nearby buildings. 
The European Union and several of its member states are voicing interest in stronger hydrogen collaboration with Africa. The seventh EU-Africa Business Forum, organized by Greece’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, yesterday underlined African potential in the hydrogen sector, potentially opening the door to new announcements at the European Union-African Union Summit planned in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. “Greek shipping is the largest cross-trader and thus, a vital component of global commerce,” said Greek foreign minister Nikos Dendias. “Greek shipping is willing and ready to become a clean and competitive low-carbon fleet.” The minister said hydrogen and green shipping are key “green energy transition opportunities for [the] African-EU partnership.” 
Norwegian start-up Aker Clean Hydrogen and Swiss maritime logistics business Kuehne+Nagel are collaborating on green container transport. The companies envision the expansion of Kuehne+Nagel’s hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol business. “The first vessels with engines that can run on these fuel alternatives are in production and expected to hit the waters in 2024,” the partners wrote on Friday. “In the early days of such first generation fossil-free engines, the sourcing of these fuels will present a challenge. Through this partnership, both companies want to help scale fossil-free shipping early on. While Aker Clean Hydrogen will secure access to green fuels, Kuehne+Nagel handles the booking of contracts for environmentally friendly containers in cooperation with their carrier partners.” The companies also reported advanced discussions with container ship owners.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/15/solar-power-prices-rising-with-demand/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"FEBRUARY 15, 2022",Solar power prices rising with demand,"From pv magazine USA
BloombergNEF has reported that global procurement of renewable energy contracts by corporations has set a new record of 31GW of capacity. Most of that capacity was procured in the Americas, with 17GW coming from the United States and 3.3GW from other nations in North and South America.

Europe, in the grip of a massive run-up in electricity pricing due to natural gas issues with Russia, signed 12GW of capacity. Asia actually saw a significant drop from 2020, with just 2GW in 2021.
BloombergNEF reports that most of the capacity was solar power. Amazon and Microsoft led the procurements with 38% of the total, and 8.2GW of that capacity was solar power.
All of these record purchases occurred despite steadily increasing pricing in the solar industry. LevelTen Energy’s recent “Q4 2021 PPA Price Index” shows prices increasing 5.7% to $34.25/MWh.

However, the price increases varied by region. For instance, California’s CAISO stayed flat, while PJM & SPP increased 15% and 15.1%, respectively. Year-over-year pricing increases were immense, averaging 12.1% for all US regions. Texas’ ERCOT region saw the lowest increase of 6.9%, while SPP prices were up more than 20%.
A LevelTen developer survey suggests that the price increases began in early 2020 due to increased demand, macroeconomic fluctuations, supply chain issues, and a confluence of other factors.

One might suspect that the increases in global electricity pricing are driving the ever-increasing demand for solar, but BloombergNEF suggests otherwise – and its data follows. It reports that 67 companies joined the RE100 last year – making for a total of 355 companies now committed to 100% renewable energy, totally offsetting their electricity use.
Of course, when we review the chart at the top of the article, it becomes apparent that corporate procurement volume had already been increasing at a consistent rate. Large increases began long before the solar hardware price increases in 2020 or the electricity pricing increases in 2021. For US solar developers, it might speak positively on the opportunity to continue selling solar power projects at pricing that pays respectable development fees.
One final factor worth considering: renewable procurements in the United States may be motivated in part by our increasing exports of US Liquid Natural Gas. According to the US Energy Information Administration, these exports have led to today’s higher natural gas prices, as a result of the country's exposure to global pricing of the fuel.

pv magazine reported in July that Nairobi-based installer PowerGen had already built seven of a proposed 28 solar mini-grids with the financial backing of multilateral lender the World Bank and three European investors.
At that point EU development body Electrifi, which aims at providing universal access to electricity, stated the aim of the project was to deliver sustainable power to 55,000 people via the mini-grids, the remainder of which would be installed by the middle of this year.
In this month’s edition, pv magazine takes a deep dive into the world of electromobility, with 22 pages of analysis taking in the market growth and expectations for electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide; how electricity networks will need to grow and adapt to make room for the electrification of transport; and the vital role for solar in all of this. We examine the growing trend for residential and commercial EV chargers linked to PV and optimized to make the most of solar kilowatt-hours, and take a look at some of the early movers working on vehicle-integrated PV – from solar sunroofs to full integration in vehicle bodywork. We also consider a range of e-mobility applications, from commercial trucks to family cars to electric bikes and other “last mile” delivery vehicles.
European development finance institution (EDFI) Electrifi was showcasing a business model which saw it and two Dutch backers – microfinance lender Oikocredit and impact investor Triodos Investment Management – commit $9 million to the mini-grid construction costs on the understanding they would be purchased, upon completion, by African mini-grid finance entity CrossBoundary Energy Access.
With Powergen supplying any additional construction costs, the World Bank is backing the scheme by funding grants of $350 for each consumer connected to electricity, with the money disbursed by the state-owned Nigeria Electrification Project.
A project update published on the EDFI Electrifi website yesterday, however, indicated only “around 20” mini-grids would be installed, with no new local networks established since July, although six more are operational and will be commissioned “soon.” In terms of delivery, the EU body reported the networks will be commissioned “by the end of 2022.”
The mini-grids will also include battery energy storage systems, according to the project announcement in July, which stated a total of 4.5MWh of capacity would accompany what was then reported would be a total mini-grid solar generation capacity of 2.1MW. EDFI Electrifi in July said the first seven networks had a generation capacity of 460kWp and storage of 1,157kWh.
The CrossBoundary Energy Access fund which will buy the completed mini-grids was set up by Nairobi-based financial services entity CrossBoundary and backed by the Shell and Rockefeller foundations, Anglo-American impact investor Ceniarth, and lottery-funded Netherlands investor Stochting Doen, with Massachusetts impact investor Blue Haven Initiative later coming on board.

The company will supply its fully integrated battery storage systems to four, undisclosed developers out to 2024.
Under the framework agreement, Powin will provide fully integrated battery energy storage facilities including cells, stacks, enclosures, cabling, transformers, inverters, battery management, and all software and controls systems.
As an up-and-coming player in the battery market, Powin develops products and software including battery modules, packs, and turnkey systems, as well as battery and energy management systems and cloud-based monitoring and control set-ups.

As part of pv magazine’s UP Initiative, we have focused on raw material sourcing in the energy storage industry. Read about material sourcing for batteries, lithium extraction in Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and the development of raw material recycling, and contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.

The company uses its proprietary software controls and ancillary equipment to hook up battery cells sourced from China. Its scalable storage systems utilize lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells mainly from CATL and EVE.
Powin’s manufacturing capacity is based in multiple locations including China and Taiwan. In 2020, the company announced plans to expand Taiwanese production from 700MWh to 2.5GWh, and it recently publicized a near-shoring deal to establish manufacturing nearer its U.S. end users and to reduce exposure to logistical problems.
In an announcement last month, Powin said it would be near-shoring fabrication of its modular Centipede lithium-ion battery systems to Monterrey, Mexico, in partnership with manufacturing and supply chain business Celestica. As confirmed last week, the majority of the new 5.8GWh supply agreements will utilize Powin’s Centipede product from that site.
Launched in November, the Centipede consists of pre-integrated modular units containing batteries, thermal management equipment, and other safety features. According to Powin, Centipede requires half the time to procure and deploy – and uses 30% less space – than rival modular storage systems, while also reducing lifecycle costs.
The product integrates multiple Powin Stack750E BESS (battery energy storage system) units, which are designed for two-to-four-hour applications, and supports more than 200MWh of energy storage capacity per acre. The third-generation battery module was updated with new thermal controls, a change Powin said will create an anticipated 80% reduction in service times.
Prior to the newly-announced supply deal, Powin said it had already secured more than 2GWh of contracts for the Centipede from multinational independent power producers and utilities. Under the new orders, the company will be responsible for commissioning the battery systems and for long-term services including on site operations and maintenance, battery augmentation, and 20-year extended warranties.
“With the significant strides that Powin has made as a company in the previous 12 months, these agreements signify that we have built a superior level of trust within the energy storage industry,” said Powin CEO Geoff Brown. “These agreements are with some of the industry’s most well-respected developers, with healthy pipelines of projects located near some of the largest power hubs throughout the American West and Northeast, as well as Asia.”

State-owned solar panel glassmaker Irico New Energy today announced a strategic co-operation agreement with PV manufacturer Jinko Solar that will see Irico prioritize supply, and Jinko the purchase of, the former’s glass. Irico said the deal, to October 2024, would be worth around RMB3.6 billion (US$566 million), with the actual volumes of glass shipped subject to future purchase orders and a framework agreement.
PV module supplier Trina Solar today said it has signed a major purchase contract with wafer maker Shuangliang Eco-Energy for 210mm products. Under the agreement, Trina will buy 1.89 billion pieces from Shuangliang to the end of 2024. Based on the latest 210mm wafer prices collated by Tainwanese analyst PV InfoLink, the Trina contract would be worth around RMB16 billion. Trina will this year buy 392 million pieces from Shuangliang, under the purchase order, with 600 million to follow next year and 900 million in 2024.
In a separate development, the solar manufacturer's Trina Storage unit yesterday announced completion of its first battery energy storage system in the United Kingdom, a 50MW/56.2MWh lithium-ion facility in Burwell, England, for Scottish smart energy infrastructure company SMS plc. Trina said it installed, commissioned and tested the battery system for a project constructed by the Ethical Power unit of Hampshire-based renewable business Hive Energy. The battery will provide grid balancing services to utility National Grid, Trina said.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/15/large-scale-solar-reaches-e0-02737-04939-kwh-lcoe-in-sweden/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,SWEDEN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 15, 2022",Large scale solar reaches €0.02737-04939/kWh LCOE in Sweden,"The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of utility scale solar power plants built without subsidies in Sweden reached a value of €0.02737–0.04939/kWh in 2019–20, according to a recent study from Chalmers University of Technology and Uppsala University.
“This is possible thanks to very low cost of capital and the good financing conditions offered by lenders in Sweden,” the research's corresponding author, Johan Lindhal, told pv magazine.
The research group analyzed, in particular, the economic parameters of six solar parks commissioned in the Scandinavian country between 2019 and 2020. The six facilities were built with a capex ranging from €603.20 to €776 per kilowatt installed and a yearly fixed operations and maintenance cost of €4.20 to €9.10/kW installed. Their installed capacity spans from three to 14MW and their expected lifetime is estimated at between 20 and 45 years.
The average debt financing level of the six commissioned PV parks was about 70% with average nominal interest rates of, on average, 2%, which resulted in a nominal cost of capital of about 3.4%, on average, which corresponded to a real weighted-average cost of capital per annum of 1.4%, under a 2% inflation assumption. “In all recent long-term scenario modeling studies done by Swedish authorities and academics, the real interest rates of PV have been assumed to be 5–7%. A 5% and 7% cost of capital – instead of 1.4 % – would increase the LCOE of the studied PV parks from the average of €0.04079/kWh to €0.05785/kWh and €0.06899/kWh, respectively,” Lindhal further explained. “Such a high LCOE for PV parks in Sweden would indeed make them economically unattractive in future power system scenario modeling.”
The scientists specified that the average LCOE value is the result of the individually calculated LCOE values for each plant and not the result of an LCOE calculation with the averages as inputs. Furthermore, the owner of the plants considered a solar module degradation rate varying between 0.2% and 0.4% per year for the six projects, which are located in different geographical areas and across three electricity trading areas.
The project with the lowest LCOE, of €0.02737/kWh, is a plant with an expected lifetime of 45 years, a 2% annual degradation, a capex of €703,758 per megawatt installed, a yearly fixed operations and maintenance cost of €11,277/MW, and a nominal weighted-average cost of capital per annum of 0.2%. The long lifetime, according to the owner, will be possible to reach by two rounds of inverter replacement reinvestment and one reinvestment in a new transformation station, under the lifetime.
By contrast, the solar park with the highest LCOE, of €0.04939/kWh is a facility with a significantly higher nominal weighted-average cost of capital per annum of 3.1% and a life expectancy of 20 years – the lowest among the six projects. Furthermore, it has an estimated annual degradation rate of 0.3%, a capex of €662,912/MW installed, and a yearly fixed operations and maintenance cost of €4,546/MW.
“Size is an important factor for the capex but what this study found out is that, for example, the choice of location and site preparation had a larger influence on capex than size, and that the cost of capital was the most important factor of reaching a low LCOE,” Lindhal emphasized.
“When comparing the LCOE values from six of the PV parks commissioned between 2019 and 2020 in Sweden with the revenues obtained from the spot market and tradable green certificates in 2019 and 2020, we conclude that the profitability of PV parks can be achieved, but are not assured, under a merchant PV business model,” the paper concluded. “This suggests that there must be other direct or indirect economical values obtained through the different ownership structures or business models applied, and indeed, all six parks in the interview study have either been realized under corporate PPA or cooperative ownership business models.”
 The findings of the research were presented in the paper “Economic analysis of the early market of centralized photovoltaic parks in Sweden,” published in Renewable Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/02/15/topcon-vs-perc-a-battle-between-fast-learning-curves/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WEBINAR PARTNER JINKO SOLAR,WEBINAR PARTNER JINKO SOLAR",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 15, 2022",TOPCon vs PERC – a battle between fast learning curves,"TOPCon photovoltaic technology is constantly gaining new market share across all segments and is the most serious candidate to challenge the primacy of PERC solar panels. However, success will depend on several variables that are still difficult to decipher.
“The TOPCon PV tech has a very high-efficiency potential achieving already 26% in research that explains its current uptake,” Stefan Gunz, the head of division photovoltaics – research at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE, told pv magazine. “However, the PERC panel technology has also a very fast learning curve and the balance between them will depend on which one will be able to increase its efficiency or reduce cost faster than the other one.”
He said TOPCon products will have more opportunities to gain ground in the race if their average efficiency, which is already comparatively higher than that of PERC products, is further raised.
“There are still margins for TOPCon manufacturers to reduce costs, especially regarding the deposition of intrinsic/doped polysilicon,” he said. “But the real step forward may be taken by further increasing their efficiency, which would ensure that the possibly slightly higher costs related to TOPCon production will be more than justified, as TOPCon panels have higher efficiency and energy yield.”
However, it remains unclear how much their efficiency should be increased.
“Manufacturers are not very transparent about their current achievements,” the German scientists said. “And this doesn't make it easy to understand which new TOPCon panels may really resemble PERC products in terms of a good trade-off between costs and performance.”
Fraunhofer ISE
The future also remains difficult to forecast.
“As always, predicting the market share of TOPCon is a look in the crystal bowl, however since PERC, as the dominating cell technology, has a large technological overlap with the TOPCon route, the change can be quite smoothly similar to the transition from aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) solar cells to PERC devices,” said Glunz.
Glunz and other scientists from the Fraunhofer ISE and University of Freiburg in Germany described the trajectory of the TOPCon technology in “Silicon-based passivating contacts: The TOPCon route,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
The study dates back to the 1980s, when the first attempts to use polysilicon layers under the contacts to reduce recombination in silicon solar cells were published.
“No details of the fabrication process of these passivating contacts have been published. Given the respective expertise of SunPower demonstrated by their patent portfolio, it appears likely that poly-Si/SiOx contacts were used,” the paper reads.
The first TOPCon cell, for which the use of poly-Si-SiOx contacts was officially unveiled, is a 23%-efficient device, with a high open-circuit voltage of 698mV, built by Frank Feldmann from the Fraunhofer ISE in 2013. It was a both-sides contacted device that was very similar to the current industrial cell structures.
“The recombination properties of the first n-type TOPCon cells were mainly limited by the recombination at the front contacts,” the researchers explained, noting that the technology has experienced a renaissance in the past decade. “In fact, the introduction of a local p++ boron diffusion under the front contacts and other improvements led to a record efficiency of 25.8% (Voc = 724 mV) on n-type TOPCon cells.”
Glunz also noted that a recent TOPCon cell structure featuring a back junction on p-type silicon even resulted in an efficiency of 26%, with an open-circuit voltage of 732mV.
The research group identified four research topics that are currently being addressed to improve the technology: the need for re-parametrizing intrinsic recombination in the silicon due to the excellent surface passivation of TOPCon structures; improving control of diffusion of dopants through the intermediate SiOx layer to optimize passivation and transport properties; the single-sided deposition of the poly-Si layer to reduce process complexity for industrial TOPCon cells; and the utilization of silicon-based tunnel junctions in perovskite–silicon tandem cells based on a TOPCon design.
“Especially the singe-sided deposition of the poly Si layers, or the corresponding single-side etch in case of both-side deposition, together with a lean metallization route for TOPCon cells are currently of high importance for the industrial introduction of TOPCon,” Glunz said.
He added that the TOPCon PV technology will possibly co-exist with PERC and heterojunction modules in the current decade.
“Since TOPCon and PERC cells share a lot process steps, we might see a quite big market share of this TOPCon in the future,” he said.

Solar cells built with these nanocrystals have so far reached efficiencies of up to 6% and their optoelectronic overall properties have been found to change drastically as their composition and size are changed. Their fabrication can be performed in air at low temperatures using low-cost solution processing techniques and inexpensive production equipment. Furthermore, AgBiS2 NCs have very low toxicity compared to other materials used for thin-film solar cells, such as cadmium telluride and cadmium sulfide itself.
With this in mind, a group of researchers from the Institute of Photonic Sciences in Spain has developed an AgBiS2 PV device with potential applications in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), vehicle-integrated solar, and internet of things (IoT) devices.
“Currently, this technology could have applications where environmental friendliness and compatibility with restrictions on hazardous substances is a big problem, like in consumer electronics,” the research's corresponding author, Gerasimos Konstantatos, told pv magazine. “It could also find applications where form factor is an issue so, in cases where low weight and flexible PV are needed and, as the performance may improve, this technology could even outcompete crystalline silicon photovoltaics in large scale applications.”
The scientists used a low-energy and scalable annealing process to produce an AgBiS2 material with an absorption coefficient that is claimed to be 5-10 times greater than any other material currently used for PV technology, across a wide spectral range from 400 to 1,000nm. “With the high absorption coefficient of our films, an ultra-thin layer of AgBiS2 NCs would be sufficient to absorb most of the light in the visible range,” they stated.
The researchers engineered the layer of nanocrystals in the cell with an unconventional approach described as cation disorder engineering, through which they tuned the atomic positions of the cations within the lattice of AgBiS2 nanocrystals to trigger a cation inter-site exchange and achieve a homogenous cation distribution. Mercaptopropionic acid was used as a passivating ligand to preserve the material quality upon annealing. “Our theoretical investigations of the thermodynamics and optical/electronic effects of cation disorder in AgBiS2 revealed both the accessibility of cation re-distribution and the strong impact of this on the optoelectronic properties,” said research co-author Seán Kavanagh. “Our calculations revealed that a homogeneous cation distribution would yield optimal solar cell performance in these disordered materials, corroborating the experimental discoveries as a testament of the synergism between theory and experiment.”
The solar cell was built with AgBiS2 nanocrystals that were deposited layer-by-layer onto a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO). It was then coated with a solution based on poly(triaryl)amine (PTAA), which is an excellent hole transporting and electron blocking material.
Tested under standard illumination conditions the device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 9.17%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.495V, a short-circuit current of 26.75mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 63%. “It is really exciting to see that 30nm device gives such a high short-circuit current density up to 27mA/cm2 and an efficiency up to 9%,” said research co-author Yongjie Wang. “After grasping control of the process and optimization of the full stack, including optimizing electron and hole transport layers, we finally found a highly reproducible structure for efficient solar cells with improved stability.”
According to Konstantatos, the proposed manufacturing process is compatible with roll-to-roll techniques like those used for organic and perovskite cells and may be immediately reproducible on an industrial scale. “The cost related to the absorbers is only a fraction of the cost of the cell,” he told pv magazine. “The material cost is less than $10/m2 whereas the total estimated cost of the cell is around $120/m2. The biggest cost component is the encapsulation technology needed for all these types of thin-film PV devices and, with improvements on this, the total cost is envisioned to drop even more.”
The solar cell was described in the paper “Cation disorder engineering yields AgBiS2 nanocrystals with enhanced optical absorption for efficient ultrathin solar cells,” published in nature.

Grenoble-based company Rosi Solar has developed a novel solution for recycling and reusing raw materials from the photovoltaic industry.
In particular, the start-up has set up a thermal and chemical separation process to recover ultra-pure silicon and other metals lost during the production of photovoltaic cells and at the end of the life of solar panels.
Rosi Solar was launched in 2017 and, since then, it has attracted the interest of many companies and institutions that now support it: French environment and energy agency Ademe, the French national investment bank BPIFrance, French environmental services provider Veolia, and European Union programs in particular.
The company's technology is based on a pyrolysis process that makes it possible to isolate the different metals from the cells. Pyrolysis is generally used for temperature decomposition of organic material in the absence of oxygen. This process is known to provide excellent rate capability and high cycling stability. It is used in the chemical industry to produce ethylene, carbon and chemicals from petroleum, coal and even wood, in addition to producing coke from coal.

“Silver represents less than 0.1% of the components of a solar module but it constitutes a big portion of its value,” Yun Luo, co-founder and president of Rosi Solar told pv magazine, noting that the same concept applies, to a lesser extent, to silicon, copper or even glass when it is of superior quality, or rather, high purity. “Our innovative process separates the metals and cells in a way that retains the purity of the material,” she stated.
Rosi Solar has not worked only on the development of a mild thermal and chemical treatment allowing the extraction of high-value metals and materials but also on the process, now patented, for the reintegration of silicon into different industries. Supported by Ademe for the proof of concept, the company utilized the results of its own research to carry out the purification of silicon, “in particular, from those of our first project, focused on the quality of the silicon recovered from the scrap resulting from the cutting of the wafers,” explained Luo. In 2019, the second extraction project was carried out in collaboration with Veolia for the proof of concept, and with Ademe for the co-financing of the industrial prototype. Rosi Solar's customers are all potential users of these materials, particularly in the chemical industry.
After several years of research and partnerships the company is now moving to the industrial deployment of its low-environmental impact recycling solution. With national players and, often, within European initiatives, it aims to promote its technologies for the purification of silicon and silver from used PV cells so as to create a market around the recovery of high-purity materials in the solar industry.
In France, its breakthrough technology, associated with the logistics and pre-processing services of Envie 2E Aquitaine, was selected by Sorem in July 2021 in a call for tenders to upgrade end-of-life photovoltaic (PV) modules. In its new plant at La Mure in Isère, the company will process laminates without glass, to extract silicon and metals. “This is our first major commercial contract,” said Luo, adding that the construction of the site began in July 2021, for commissioning planned by the fourth quarter of 2022. Eventually, the plant could recycle around 3,000 tons of solar panels per year, which corresponds to about three tons of silver and 90 tons of silicon.
In Germany, Rosi Solar is participating in the ReProSolar project led by a Veolia subsidiary in Germany, with the participation of Flaxres, Evonik, Technalia, and the French National Center for Scientific Research, which aims to separate, for the first time, all the components of PV modules in order to demonstrate the challenge of high value-added recycling of solar panels on an industrial scale. The EU is notably supporting the project with a contribution of €4.8 million via EIT Rawmaterials, which aims to significantly enhance innovation in the raw materials sector by sharing knowledge, information and expertise.
“We are at the beginning of a tsunami with regard to the PV module recycling market,” explained Luo, who foresees growth.

Last week, Argentina's Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, Luis Manzur, and the president of Argentinian oil and gas company Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF), Pablo González, participated in the groundbreaking ceremony of a 300 MW solar plant in Bella Vista, in the Iglesia Department, in the country's northern region of San Juan.
The Parque Solar Zonda project is expected to be built in three 100 MW phases and to require a total surface of 300 hectares.
The construction of the first phase of the project should take 14 months and require an investment of $90 million.
The oil company recently issued a $63.4 million green bond with an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 10 years to finance the project.
When built, the 300 MW solar facility will raise the share of renewables in the San Juan Province to 25% and will equal the capacity of Argentina's largest PV plant – the Cauchari solar project.
This project was selected by the Argentinian government in the first round of the RenovAr program and was financed with funds from the Chinese state-owned Export-Import Bank of China, and a $210 million bond issued by the province of Jujuy, where it is located. Argentinean energy provider Jemse owns an 80% stake in the project, with the remaining 20% split between Power China, Shanghai Electric and Talesun.

With a population of about 25 million, Australia now has nearly 1kW of PV installed per person – easily retaining its world-leading status.
By the end of 2021, there were more than 3.04 million PV installations in Australia, with a combined capacity of over 25.3GW, the Australian PV Institute noted.
Australia’s solar market has gone through surging periods of growth since the government’s Renewable Energy Target (RET) scheme commenced on April 1, 2001. Between 2001 and 2010, the solar market’s growth sat around 15%, before a period of far more rapid growth from 2010 to 2013.
After stabilizing between 2014 and 2015, the market is trending upwards, driven by residential installations. Rooftop solar today plays an important role in Australia’s energy mix, contributing 7.9% to the National Electricity Market (NEM) demand in 2021, up from 6.4% in 2020 and 5.2% in 2019.
According to figures published by the Climate Council in February, renewable energy generation in the National Electricity Market increased by almost 20% in 2021, with renewables supplying 31.4% of electricity generation last year.
In South Australia, these percentages are far more staggering. In the final days of 2021, the state ran for almost one week on renewable energy. South Australia’s 156-hour stint powered by wind, rooftop solar and utility-scale solar farms, firmed by fractional amounts of gas, was considered record-breaking for comparable grids around the world.
