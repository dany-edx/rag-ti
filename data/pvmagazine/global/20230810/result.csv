The initiative aims to support the deployment of commercial and industrial PV systems.
Businesses will be granted solar-related loans, backed by a 20% first-loss guarantee from the South African Reserve Bank.
“The EBB aims to generate 1,000 MW in additional generation capacity as well as facilitate resilience to loadshedding for micro and informal businesses,” said the authorities.
The measures for enhancing resilience include power storage assets like batteries and inverters, even without direct generation capacity.
The program will operate through three distinct mechanisms: loan guarantees for small- and medium-sized companies, loan guarantees for energy service companies (ESCOs), and working capital loans for businesses in the rooftop solar supply chain.
Participating companies must have a maximum turnover of ZAR 300 million ($15.9 million), with a maximum borrowing limit of ZAR 10 million. The program is set to expire on Aug. 30, 2024.

The Port of Valencia is testing a vertical PV system on the Dique Norte breakwater to assess the feasibility and efficiency of such installations.
The pilot run could potentially lead to the development of the first large-scale vertical photovoltaic park in Spain. SunnerBox, a local startup, has introduced its IT3 solution for the pilot project.
It uses a matrix system of solar panels on a mesh anchored directly to the breakwater through stay cables and tensioners. This approach maximizes existing infrastructure, streamlines installation, and reduces costs while facilitating maintenance.
The system, with a total installed power of 8.6 kW, consists of 21 solar modules, each with a capacity of 410 W.
The Port Authority of Valencia (APV), in collaboration with the Center for Research in Project Management, Innovation, and Sustainability (PRINS) at the Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV), is currently conducting a two-month, real-time testing phase.
This phase aims to measure both energy generation and structural behavior using a range of sensors, with the additional function of powering the sensor system through the generated energy.
Following the successful completion of the testing period, the APV plans to secure funding for a larger-scale installation on the breakwater.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/10/green-hydrogen-offtakers-can-shape-the-industrys-development/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",,"AUGUST 10, 2023",Green hydrogen offtakers can shape the industry’s development,"Casting doubt on green hydrogen’s utility is a popular sport. High capital costs and the vast spaces needed for associated renewables are cited as the main reasons preventing this clean energy source being commercially viable.
Hydrogen’s potential as a clean energy source has been widely discussed in recent years, driven by events such as the war in Ukraine. Hydrogen’s popularity stems from its ability to store and release energy without greenhouse gas emissions when extracted from water using renewable energy – or with carbon sequestration when the gas is produced using fossil fuels.
This has made hydrogen a critical component of energy planning as a “low to no”-CO2 fuel source for hard-to-electrify segments of the transportation and heavy industry sectors.
The $2/kg mark is generally thought the sweet spot for hydrogen to become a commercially viable alternative fuel. Estimates suggest hydrogen could be produced at $2 at the factory gate by 2030 in countries with good renewables.
In Australia, we can quite easily reach the magical $2 mark – or less – by 2030, with growing demand in domestic and export markets. The federal government’s Hydrogen Headstart program, announced in May’s budget, showcases Australia’s commitment to the industry’s development. The strategy makes it clear Australia won’t be missing out on the benefits of hydrogen as it will stay on track with developments across other markets including the US, Canada, and Germany. Many Australian industrial organizations estimate the current cost of delivered hydrogen as well above $7/kg, however. Where is the cost differential coming from?
The key to successful hydrogen adoption is a systems approach to project development. Rather than viewing each component of the hydrogen production and delivery system in isolation, it is vital to consider the entire supply chain and to design the system as a whole. This holistic approach will minimize cost, while optimizing performance.
Three levers will dramatically reduce the cost of large-scale systems.
Large-scale clean hydrogen production is still in its infancy, with many new projects announced but limited actual development. As a result, customers with large orders can have significant input into the design of hydrogen systems.
For example, customers seeking to build multi-gigawatt projects can engage directly with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to secure tailored technical specifications and get accurate prices.
These prices should consider future delivery timelines as the cost of renewables and electrolyzers are likely to significantly decrease in the coming years.
Balance-of-plant costs are often neglected but can take up a significant portion of the expense of renewables and electrolyzers. A deep dive into this component can reveal plenty of opportunity for cost reduction.
Companies should start with clarity about their hydrogen requirements and design systems accordingly. For example, an export project will need hydrogen (or a hydrogen carrier) ready to load on a ship upon arrival whereas an iron smelter needs a constant, reliable, daily supply. The various elements of the hydrogen delivery system should be put together with offtake requirement in mind.
As seen on many occasions in South Australia, having electrolyzer capacity on site can be useful when costs from the grid go negative, meaning businesses have the opportunity to turn their hydrogen production to generate a profit. This may make hydrogen production a smart addition to the overall system but a set-up wholly reliant on the grid is unlikely to cost-effectively meet the requirements for continuous, reliable hydrogen supply.
To ensure a constant, reliable supply of hydrogen, project proponents must focus on the entire supply chain to safeguard success. When designing large systems, it is tempting to break them up into different components and have people in the team (consultants, engineering firms, or OEMs) design them separately then put them back together. Instead of reducing costs, this approach will lead to higher expense.
Let’s say you need 1 GW of renewables input. The temptation is to design a renewables farm that delivers 1 GW of energy at all times but this is not necessary and is likely to result in high cost. The sun does not shine all the time so an engineer designing the renewable energy supply is likely to add storage (batteries or pumped hydro) or firming through the grid, adding substantially to the cost of electricity, and thus the cost of hydrogen.
Whole-system consideration of energy supply tells us running an electrolyzer at a lower capacity factor – with reduced energy costs – can optimize the price of hydrogen. There are multiple and frequent opportunities in the supply chain to firm output at a lower cost. It is important to understand how elements interact rather than focusing on maximizing utilization of any single component.
These three strategies could deliver hydrogen for less than $2/kg, based on experience working alongside organizations across the hydrogen supply chain and taking a systems approach to project development. This will be the key to our future energy security, as indicated by a joint Japanese and Australian consortium comprising governments, universities, and energy institutes.
While there are significant balance of trade opportunities for Australia when it comes to green hydrogen, it would be wise for local industry (with government support) to prioritize the domestic market and then use its learnings to move into export. Not only will this assist with our own decarbonization and create more jobs per kilo of hydrogen, it will also decrease the cost of hydrogen before moving into big export projects.
Exporting is inevitable, however. For example, Japan's interest in co-firing ammonia in coal plants creates hydrogen demand. Unlike Australia, where electrification is cheaper than using gas for households, Japan's high electricity prices will keep many households on gas.
As Australian industry reaches scale, and with the support of growing technical knowhow, prices will undoubtedly decline. It will be exciting to see hydrogen follow a similar cost-reduction trajectory as has been witnessed for solar and wind power.

The project site is in a port area close to the futuristic Neom City project.
Once it is completed, the solar plant will be the largest PV array in the Middle East. It will power a $8.7 billion green hydrogen plant that NGHC is also building in Oxagon.
“NGHC will produce carbon-free hydrogen using solely renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power to produce up to 600 tonnes per day of carbon-free hydrogen by the end of 2026,” Sungrow said.
The Chinese inverter supplier noted that it has also agreed to provide the project's engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor, India-based Larsen & Toubro, with 400 MWh of energy storage systems and 536 MW/600 MWh of DC capacity.
“The solution is an innovation combining the advantages of both central and string inverters, featuring a 1.1 MW single unit as the minimum, and the maximum capacity can be expanded to 8.8 MW by combing eight units together,” Sungrow said, in reference to the inverters for the 2.2 GW plant. “As a result of the optimal IP65 high protection capability, the solution is resilient to sandy, dry, and windy conditions. Due to the smart forced air-cooling technology, the inverter solution can work stably in extremely high temperatures.”
NGHC is an equal joint venture between Saudi energy giant ACWA Power, US-based hydrogen company Air Products, and Neom, a wholly owned subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. It is financing the hydrogen project in Oxagon with non-recourse financing from 23 local, regional financial institutions.
In May, NGHC said that it had obtained an exclusive 30-year offtake agreement for all of the green ammonia that will be produced. The project secured its industrial operating license from Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources in January.

In the United Kingdom, Octopus Energy’s generation unit and investment firm Legal & General Capital have jointly committed GBP 70 million ($89 million) to Kensa Group, a specialized ground-source heat pump producer.
Kensa Group plans to use the funds to expand its operations and facilitate the installation of 50,000 heat pumps per year by 2030. This expansion is expected to create more than 7,000 green jobs in the United Kingdom. The investment aims to enhance accessibility to heat pumps for various properties, encompassing retrofits for social housing, terraced housing, and non-domestic buildings.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/08/10/distributed-solar-as-an-antidote-to-illegal-roof-dwellings/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,TAIWAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 10, 2023",Distributed solar as an antidote to illegal roof dwellings,"Researchers at the National Taiwan University have proposed to use rooftop solar power generation as an antidote to the so-called rooftop slum, which consists of building illegal housing on the rooftops of apartment buildings in cities and countries with a high population density and low land availability, such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, and South Korea.
The scientists proposed a market-based incentive scheme for rooftop PV in an effort to encourage Taiwanese property owners to shift away from illegal rooftop dwellings. They claim 711,109 illegal constructions of this kind have been built in the country to date, most of which, 84% or 595,478 cases, are located in six cities, namely Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung.
“Addressing the issue of illegal rooftop dwellings becomes crucial not only from a regulatory standpoint but also in unlocking the full capacity of urban rooftops for solar PV deployment,” they stated, noting that some significant action to demolish part of these illegal dwellings was already implemented by the island's authorities.
The group said the country's feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme in place for rooftop solar does not represent a real incentive for owners of illegal rooftop dwellings as they usually rent them out to increase their income.
Their analysis considered demolition costs, solar panel capital and maintenance costs, rental income loss due to the removal of illegal additions, and benefits from solar FITs. “Government incentives are strategically devised to bridge the gap between rental income derived from illegal additions and the net expenses associated with solar deployment,” they stated, adding that filling the gap created by the rental income loss represents a substantial share of the overall transition costs, significantly influencing the decision-making of property owners.
The researchers emphasized that an incentive scheme aimed to replace illegal roof dwellings with rooftop PV arrays will have to inevitably include funds to compensate the owners of the roofs for the income losses. The required government subsidy should be calculated based on market supply curves for illegal rooftop rental housing based on real-world rental data.
Their findings were presented in the paper “Transitioning from illegal rooftop dwellings to solar PV: Market-based incentive design and techno-economic analysis,” published in Energy Strategy Reviews. “Our study provides a practical framework for market-based incentives in the context of Taiwan's four largest special municipalities, it is essential to acknowledge that its applicability and effectiveness may vary in different geographical settings,” the researchers concluded.

During the first half of this year, a survey conducted by consultancy Greener shows that Brazil imported 7.8 GW of PV modules, marking a 21% decline from the corresponding period in 2022, when the import volume was 9.9 GW.
Greener said that the demand for large-scale utility PV projects counterbalanced the sluggishness in the distributed generation market from January to June, offsetting the reduction in imports. In the distributed generation sector, constituting two-thirds of the Brazilian PV market, system sales volume experienced a notable drop of 60% to 70% in the first quarter, according to Greener.
Lower sales have prompted equipment distributors to accumulate larger inventories, which, coupled with the decrease in polysilicon and module prices, could trigger cost reductions and potentially revive demand in the rooftop segment.
In July 2023, the price of polysilicon plummeted to levels below $9.00/kg, representing a staggering decline of over 70% from the peak of $30.80/kg in February, as indicated in the report. This significant price shift could have a substantial impact on lowering the costs of photovoltaic systems in the medium term, considering that silicon constitutes roughly 60% of photovoltaic module expenses, which in turn account for 38% to 50% of the final system price.

The country's first auction will be launched by the end of this month, with successful bidders to be announced in November.
The Romanian Ministry of Energy started seeking expressions of interest for its first renewables auction in December. At the time, it said that eligible facilities should have a minimum capacity of 5 MW.
“The scheme, inspired by the UK model, will support onshore wind and photovoltaic projects with a total capacity of 5,000 MW split in two auctions, with the first auction in 2023 for 2,000 MW and the second auction in 2025 for 3,000 MW,” Mihaela Nyerges, managing partner at law firm Nyerges & Partners, told pv magazine. “In both auctions, capacity will be equally split between the two technologies.”
She said that the timeline for the 2023 tender is quite ambitious, with final objective to sign the CfD contracts by the end of this year. The bidders must include in their bids the target commissioning date, project capacity, and strike price expressed in euros per megawatt-hour.
With regard to eligibility requirements, Nyerges notes that projects with storage capacities behind the meter will not be considered as well as those benefiting from other support schemes (for example National Recovery and Resilience Plan or Modernization Fund).
Furthermore, a technical connection permit must be already obtained, with a connection date no later than December 2026. Should the delays exceed 24 months, the CfD contract will be terminated.
Finally, projects for which the engineering, procurement and construction contracts or equipment supply contracts were concluded are still eligible to the extent such contracts were concluded after July 20, 2022.
“Importantly, the scheme beneficiaries will not receive the CfD payment for the intervals where the market reference price is negative,” Nzerges says. “This severely affects the stability given by the CfD contract and its bankability, especially considering that we have already seen negative prices earlier this year and such cases are expected to become more frequent once new capacities are commissioned.”
The Ministry of Energy and other local authorities are now working with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to create the necessary legal and regulatory framework for the CfD support scheme. The final information note to bidders is to be published ahead of the official launch of the auction and will be made available on the Romanian Ministry of Energy’s website.
Two-way CfD schemes like the one which will be implemented in Romania are designed to incentivize investments in renewable energy by providing revenue stability to developers and strengthening the market integration of renewables.
“This new CfD scheme awarded through auctions is critical to unlocking private-sector investment and to ensuring the transition to a resilient and green energy sector,” said Mark Davis, EBRD Regional Head of Romania and Bulgaria.
The forthcoming auction represents the first round of a multi-year plan, which envisages the award of CfDs for a total of 10 GW of onshore wind power and PV capacity by 2030.
The procurement exercise is designed in line with the country’s Recovery and Resilience Plan milestones to have the first capacities supported by this mechanism up and running by 2026 and its renewable energy targets.
Last year, Romanian Energy Minister Virgil Popescu told Reuters that the scheme will translate into “an explosion of renewable energy development.” However, he noted that CfDs would also be used “to finance conventional energy such as nuclear.”
The country has committed to phasing out coal by 2032 and replacing it with nuclear, gas and renewable energy. It has also vowed to restructure lignite-fired holding CE Oltenia by 2026 and replace its old capacity with 725 MW of solar power and some gas.
According to the Romanian Photovoltaic Industry Association (RPIA), at least 3 GW of renewables are to be added by 2026, with solar accounting for around 2 GW of the total. The latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Romania had 1,414 MW of solar installed at the end of 2022.

Data from Rystad Energy Senior Analyst David Dixon shows the operational charging capacity from utility batteries in the National Electricity Market (NEM) now stands at 1,451 MW, outstripping the 1,340 MW attributed to pumped hydro.
The ascension of grid-scale batteries comes after the energisation of Genex Power’s 50 MW/100 MWh Bouldercombe Big Battery project near Rockhampton in Queensland and French developer Neoen’s 100 MW/200 MWh Capital Battery in the Australian Capital Territory. Both projects are now working through the commissioning stages.
The batteries are the latest in a slew of big battery projects to connect to the NEM in recent months. These include French renewables giant Engie’s 150 MW/150 MWh Hazelwood battery in Victoria, and the 250 MW/250 MWh Torrens Island and 41 MW/412 MWh Tailem Bend batteries in South Australia. Edify Energy’s Riverina Energy Storage System, a project combining three separate battery facilities totalling 150 MW/300 MWh in New South Wales, has also been energized.
Dixon said he expects the gap between battery storage capacity and pumped hydro to increase further over the next few years with “several more utility battery projects expected to enter the market.”
“By 2026 the operational capacity of utility batteries in the NEM will be greater than 6 GW,” he said.
Among those projects set to enter the market are Akaysha Energy’s 850 MW/1,680 MWh Waratah Super Battery project, and the 460 MW/920 WMh first stage of Origin Energy’s planned 700 MW/2,800 MWh Eraring Battery, both in New South Wales.
Neoen is also continuing to grow its energy storage portfolio, having commenced construction of the 200 MW/400 MWh Blyth Battery storage system in South Australia and the 200 MW/400 MWh Western Downs Battery in Queensland.

In assessing the negative effects of heat on FPVs, the researchers found that “each 1-degree Celsius rise in operational temperature resulted in a 0.5% drop in Photovoltaic module electrical efficiency.”
To combat this problem, the group conducted experiments using two distinct submerged heat sink designs, one with perforated fins (PSAPFs) and one with solid fins (PSASFs). They assessed the thermal and electrical performance compared with a reference FPV array without cooling (FPV-R). The report specifies that the goal was “to identify the optimal productivity of the FPV module in terms of heat sink designs, module operating temperature, wind and water current speeds.”
With a surface water current of 0.3 m/s and wind of 5 m/s with a direction of 60 degrees, the researchers found that the use of PSAPFs resulted in a 28.11% increase in electrical efficiency and a 33.31% reduction in operating temperature compared to the FPV-R. The use of PSASFs resulted in a 22.82%  increase in electrical efficiency and a 28.39% reduction in operating temperature compared to the FPV-R.
“The generated power of the FPV-PSASF and FPV-PSAPF modules enhanced by 18.14% and 22.77%, respectively, in comparison to the FPV-R module, achieving average values of 56.59 W and 58.81 W, respectively,” the group said, noting that all systems were operating under the same conditions.
The academics used two arrangements of aluminum-angle U-shape fin arrays that were each 900 mm long. Each array featured 12 angle fins, with 600 mm on the backside of the FPV exposed to ambient air, and the other 300 mm submerged in a large water basin that simulated the actual body of water. The fins expanded the heat transfer surface area of the FPVs, removing heat via convection.
The researchers chose aluminum as the fin array material “due to its good thermal conductivity, lightweight, and low cost.” Researchers bonded the fins to a flat aluminum plate before using resin to affix them to the backside of the modules under investigation. This method enabled easy installation or removal of the fin arrangement.
According to the group, “The economic assessment revealed that the LCOE of the PSAPF-FPV module with the optimized condition decreased by 17.70% to 0.068 ($/kWh) while attaching the partially submerged angle solid fins PSASF reduced the LCOE by 12.50%, comparing to the referenced FPV module, to 0.072 ($/kWh).” The perforated fins not only provided better results than the solid fins, they also reduced the material fin weight by 15% in comparison.
The researchers’ conclusions appeared in “An innovative cooling technique for floating photovoltaic module: Adoption of partially submerged angle fins,” published in Energy Conversion and Management: X. The authors include members of the faculty from Port-Said University, as well as a researcher from Egypt’s Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy.
“Future studies will look at the quantified rates of water conserved as well as the overall reduction in evaporation. These, as well as other related cooling strategies, should be researched further in the future,” the authors concluded.

This time, ETIP PV is presenting its Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA), published in collaboration with the European Energy Research Alliance for PV (EERA-PV).
The SRIA presents five core challenges for the research and innovation sector (in Europe) and additionally outlines comprehensive strategies and clear targets for each of them. The SRIA is a valuable source for anyone interested in PV research and innovation at scale, and especially for research institutes and a forward-looking PV industry that seeks to capitalize on R&D.
For the first challenge, the SRIA elaborates that the levelized cost of electricity (LCoE) can be lowered even further via three possible objectives: higher efficiency of the PV modules, appropriate system design, and digitalization of PV. The first objective in particular requires a strong focus on research and innovation – especially in Europe – where R&I remains the backbone of the European efforts to create a competitive PV supply chain. In addition to establishing a strong industrial base of today’s best available technologies, doing R&I at scale must be implemented hand-in-hand with more basic as well as industry-oriented programs, to prevent the risk of investing only in technologies that will one day be obsolete, especially now that innovation cycles have significantly accelerated in the past decade.
Although PV already has a comparatively small environmental impact per unit of electrical energy generated, the huge role that PV needs to play in the energy transition implies that enormous amounts of energy and materials must be consumed for its manufacturing. Therefore, through five different roadmaps (Reduce, Repair, Recycle, Sustainable Manufacturing, and Eco-Labeling), the second challenge in the SRIA discusses how to lower, among other factors, the carbon footprint of PV manufacturing and reach a nearly 100% recyclable and circular PV technology.
The third challenge is dedicated to PV integrated in buildings, vehicles, agriculture, (manmade) water surfaces and the built environment (infrastructures), especially since many of the integrated PV solutions are so far mostly based in Europe, creating a valuable export opportunity for the European energy sector.
The main objective of the fourth challenge is to elaborate how through various R&I roadmaps – such as more intelligent distribution, dependable and openly available forecasting tools, improved efficiencies by integrating PV systems in DC networks, and hybrid systems – the reliability of the energy system based on a very high penetration of PV can be improved.
The fifth challenge discusses how via co-working with regulatory and administrative stakeholders for innovative regulatory and administrative approaches, exploration of the role of PV in promoting behavioral changes, or educating and engaging with citizens on all levels, one can better understand the main drivers behind the public opinion about PV. Thus, one can raise awareness about the economic and sustainability benefits of PV and finally, create a paradigm shift in public support, and move from declarative to on-spot actual support.
ETIP PV is continuously updating and expanding the SRIA, e.g. by its newly published “White paper on PV Manufacturing in Europe”. The updated version of the SRIA is expected to be published in 2024. Finally, ETIP PV working groups will present their recent findings at the upcoming EU-PVSEC conference in Lisbon and organize interactive parallel sessions on e.g. digital grid PV, LCoE, as well as reliability and circularity.

Swift Current Energy has secured project financing for the 800 MW (DC)/593 MW (AC) Double Black Diamond solar project. Once operational, it will be the second largest solar project in the United States. More than $779 million in project financing was closed for this project, making it among the largest solar project financings in US history.
Located 30 miles west of Springfield, Illinois, the project is currently under construction and is expected to reach commercial operation in 2024. It is expected to produce enough electricity to provide the equivalent of 100,000 homes and will offset an estimated 1 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.
Approximately 450 construction workers are employed at the site, and McCarthy Building Companies is operating as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner. First Solar modules, the majority of which are manufactured in the United States, and US-made Nextracker solar trackers were selected for the project.
“Double Black Diamond Solar is a transformative project, not only for our team, but also the American workers it is employing, the massive amount of emissions-free energy it will produce, and the stable revenue it will provide for the communities in Sangamon and Morgan counties,” said Eric Lammers, chief executive officer of Swift Current Energy.
The project is expected to provide $100 million in tax revenue to Sangamon and Morgan counties in central Illinois.
