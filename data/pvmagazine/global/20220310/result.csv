The study published by the UK government's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) stated “gross electricity consumption” consisted of the volume of electricity generated in Scotland plus electricity imports and minus exports.

Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights.

Dampened demand for electricity in Scotland as Covid-19 measures bit in 2020, plus favorable weather conditions, ensured the nation exported a record net 37.3% of its electricity to England and Northern Ireland, according to the study of electricity generation and supply in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales from 2016 to 2020.
The BEIS publication, issued yesterday and based on statistics released by the government on December 23, said Scotland sourced 87.6% of its electricity from low-carbon – defined as renewables plus nuclear – sources in 2020. The figure for England was 55.9% with nuclear-free Northern Ireland and Wales generating 45.6% and 36.1% of their electricity, respectively, from low-carbon plants.
The report noted the closure of the 1,725MW generation capacity Aberthaw B coal-fired power station in Glamorgan, South Wales in 2020 ended more than 125 years of coal-fired power in the nation, which joined Scotland as coal power free. England plans to shutter its last coal-fired plants by October 2024.
The BEIS document noted coal-fired power production rose 16%, however, in Northern Ireland two years ago.
A separate, quarterly update of UK renewables capacity in the July-to-September period of last year – published by BEIS alongside the 2016-20 document – said the country had added 269MW more solar generation capacity than it had recorded a year earlier.
Unfavorable weather conditions last year, however, ensured the UK generated only 1.8% more solar power than it had during the third quarter of 2020.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/10/rocket-lab-unveils-space-solar-cell-with-33-3-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 10, 2022",Rocket Lab unveils space solar cell with 33.3% efficiency,"US-based aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider Rocket Lab USA Inc has presented a new space-grade solar cell based on a cell technology developed by space solar cell maker Solaero, which it acquired in December.
The new product, dubbed IMM-β, is an evolution of Solaero's inverted metamorphic multi-junction (IMM) solar cell, based on indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) and developed by scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
“The IMM-β solar cell is expected to be the highest-efficiency space solar cell technology in high-volume production,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The cell boasts an average 33.3% beginning of life (BOL) efficiency, up from 32% for the IMM-α that is currently in volume production.”
According to Solaero's website, the IMM-α solar cell has a thickness of 150μm and a mass of 49mg/cm2, which represents a 42% reduction as compared to conventional multi-junction, space-grade solar cells.
The new cell can be used in applications in the civil, military and commercial space markets. “The IMM-β is also a radiation-hard cell with a power remaining factor of 87% after exposure to 1-MeV electrons at a fluence of 1E15 e/cm2 or equivalent of about 15 years life,” Rocket Lab stated. “Now undergoing final space qualification testing, the cells are expected to be ready for commercial use later in 2022.”
“In partnership with our colleagues at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), we’re not only commercializing the world’s highest efficiency and lightest weight space solar cell, we’re doing so at the most competitive cost of any IMM technology to date. IMM-β's impact on solar array and launch mass will make it a compelling option for satellite integrators,” said Solaero CEO Brad Clevenger.
Solaero operates an 11,000m² manufacturing facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where it produces different kinds of space solar cells.
These include a 30%-efficient four-junction device on a germanium substrate; a 30.2%-efficient triple-junction solar cell optimized for low earth orbit (LEO) applications; a 29.5%-efficient, standard triple-junction cell based on indium gallium phosphide (InGaP), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) and germanium (Ge); a 29.4%-efficient triple-junction device based on a germanium substrate; and the above-mentioned IMM-α cell, with an efficiency of 32%.

The Institute of Home Automation and Energy Efficiency and the University of Malaga (UMA), in Spain, are developing a circular economy project to improve water supply in southern Spain via solar-powered water desalination.
Named Agua+S, the research project is aimed at combining a desalination plant, a pumping station network, and an onshore, floating photovoltaic plant in a single project design.

Circular manufacturing has been under the spotlight of our UP Initiative. We considered whether adopting circular approaches could create a competitive edge and reap financial and reputational rewards, in addition to investigating what is already being done in the solar industry. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.

The desalination unit should be located near the sea at the mouth of a river, and the pumping station would be built in the riverbed and would transfer the water from the desalination plant to a swamp reservoir. The floating photovoltaic plant should be deployed on the water of a reservoir less than 20km from the sea, and should supply all the electricity needed to carry out the entire desalination process.
“Usually, desalinated water has to be mineralized, since consuming this pure water is detrimental to health. Therefore, we choose to pour it into a swamp reservoir where the mineralization process can be implemented,” explained researcher Salvador Merino.
According to the research group this is the first time that these three facilities have been combined together in a fully reproducible design that could be replicated in any river basin that has a reservoir and is close to the coast, to produce fresh water for both irrigation and human consumption.
“Agua+S would allow the production of 20 cubic hectometers (hm3) of water per year,” said Merino, noting that the project will rely almost entirely on existing water and electricity distribution networks.
According to its developers, the project could be implemented in less than a year at a cost of around €60 million. Its payback time is estimated at between three and four years. The brine generated by the desalination process will be used for the production of salt, chlorine and other chemical derivatives.

Renalfa yesterday announced it will supply 20GWh per year of solar electricity to Mexican-controlled telecoms company A1 Bulgaria.
The latest edition of pv magazine investigates the rapid rise of TOPCon cell manufacturing. While not the only option PV manufacturers have their eye on, TOPCon is already the first n-type cell to claim significant market share. We chart the tech’s progress from laboratory to gigawatt production, plus efforts to standardize process flows, reduce costs, and raise performance.
As part of the corporate PPA deal, Renalfa business Toki.bg will act as an intermediary between Renalfa's 33MWp solar field in southern Bulgaria and A1, ensuring the latter has the electricity it needs even when solar panels are not generating and assuming any risks associated with topping up the power supply when needed. In return, A1 will pay Toki.bg a sleeving fee.
“Corporate PPAs are the backbone of the clean energy transition and we are happy to announce the first ‘sleeved' PPA on the Bulgarian market,” said Renalfa executive director Yuri Katanov in a press release issued by A1 and the renewables developer yesterday.
Renalfa did not reveal how much A1 will pay for the solar electricity.
The telecoms company's parent, A1 Telekom Austria Group – which is itself controlled by Mexico City-based América Móvil – has set a target of reaching net zero operations this decade, according to the press statement.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/10/senec-remotely-switches-off-its-residential-batteries-after-explosion-in-germany/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"MARCH 10, 2022",Senec remotely switches off its residential batteries after explosion in Germany,"From pv magazine Germany
German battery provider Senec announced this week its residential storage systems were automatically switched to a regulated stand-by mode.
The remote shutdown relates to three products from the company: the Senec.Home V3 hybrid; Senec.Home V3 hybrid duo; and Senec.Home V2.1. The manufacturer describes the move as a “purely precautionary measure,” in a notice to the system operators published on its Facebook page. “This is a voluntary and preventive measure. There are no indications that there are any technical problems with our systems,” said Senec.
The background to the remote shutdown is three reports of explosions in houses in which Senec storage systems were installed. The fire department of Bodnegg, in Germany's southern region of Baden-Württemberg, reported an explosion in an apartment building last week.
“When the first forces arrived, a house covered in smoke and a roof window that had been torn out, were explored,” says the report from the fire brigade. A heavily smoky boiler room was discovered in the basement. As it turned out, the battery storage installed in the basement detonated due to a technical defect and subsequently caused a smoldering fire in the basement. The pressure wave pushed several windows and doors outwards, and the entire roof structure was lifted,” the fire department said.

A technician from local utility EnBW switched the building off, a master electrician pulled the fuses and then the battery was dismantled. “The battery was carried out of the basement by five people wearing breathing apparatus and it ignited again in the open air. There it was extinguished and later placed in a vat of water to cool down. The house is currently no longer habitable,” the Bodnegg fire department continued.
Since there were no people in the building, no one was injured, and no one was injured in the other incidents either, according to Senec's letter.
“Since the issue of safety is our top priority, we have, nevertheless, decided to take this clear step,” the Leipzig-based company stated. “The cause of the events has not yet been conclusively determined. There are no indications that the battery was the cause of the explosion. Even external experts who were immediately involved do not assume that the storage devices led to the explosions,” Senec writes to its customers.
“We assume that we will maintain the standby mode for a few days,” the company went on to say. Remote shutdown is not possible for storage devices that are not connected to the internet. In this case, operators should contact their specialist partner or the Senec hotline, on +49 341 870 570.
Despite the remote shutdown, according to Senec, the photovoltaic inverter is still active and direct consumption and the feeding of solar power is therefore possible. “The only thing that does not happen in the stand-by mode is that battery power is not stored and drawn as it is galvanically isolated from the power flow,” the company said in its letter to customers. Senec promises specific information on restarting as soon as there is more clarity about the facts that led to the deflagration.
Senec was initially unable to obtain further information on the specific number of storage systems that had been shut down and the locations of other incidents. An inquiry from pv magazine has remained unanswered.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/10/solar-cells-based-on-2d-carbides-nitrides/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 10, 2022","Solar cells based on 2D carbides, nitrides","An international research group has conducted a review to investigate how two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides known as MXenes could be used as materials for solar cells.
MXenes compounds take their name from their graphene-like morphology and are made via selective etching of certain atomic layers from a bulk crystal known as MAX.
“Recently, MXenes have shown promise for use in PV technology owing to their unique optoelectronic properties, such as their large charge carrier mobility, excellent metallic conductivity, high optical transmittance, and tunable work function (WF),” the scientists said, noting that an MXenes compound known as titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx) has already been used for applications in solar cells.
The scientists said that MXenes materials exhibit good conductive behavior, but a few of them with suitable surface terminations can also exhibit semiconductor-like behavior.
“The superconductive, conductive, or semiconductive-like characteristics of MXene are entirely dependent upon the surface terminations. Without surface terminations, all MXenes are expected to behave as metallic conductors, where the transition metals are the charge carriers,” they said.
The first attempt to use MXenes in solar cells dates back to 2018, when Ti3C2Tx was used as an additive in the absorbing layer of a MAPbI3-based perovskite cell. This resulted in enhanced grain size and raised device efficiency from 15.5% to 17.4%.
“The large crystal size enhanced the light absorption ability of the perovskite layer,” the scientists said. “Additionally, the high electrical conductivity and mobility of Ti3C2Tx were found to be advantageous for boosting the charge-carrier transfer inside the device.”
In other research, ultra-thin Ti3C2Tx quantum dots (TQDs) were considered for use in perovskite absorber films, electron transport layers (ETLs) and hole transport layers (HTLs) to build perovskite-based, organic and crystalline silicon PV cells. The 2D compound was also used to develop highly transparent and conductive electrodes (TCEs).
“The high transparency of the TCEs allows more photons to be harvested, thus leading to increased absorption. The high cost of carbon-based electrodes limits their application in PV technology,” the academics said.
They have called for more simulation and theoretical studies to optimize the properties of Ti3C2Tx and other MXenes materials, as several challenges and limitations still need to be addressed to make them viable for long-term practical applications. They also noted that Ti3C2Tx flakes are toxic and that a roadmap for their integration on an industrial scale should be properly considered.
Another issue for MXenes solar cells might be their long-term stability. However, Ti3C2Tx has thus far demonstrated relatively higher stability.
“Its long-term exposure to the ambient environment degrades the device performance, mainly because of the oxidation of Ti3C2Tx flakes,” the researchers explained.
They presented their findings in “2D MXene: A Potential Candidate for Photovoltaic Cells? A Critical Review,” which was recently published in Advanced Science. The research group includes scientists from Dongguk University, Korea University, and Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU).
“This systematic review is both expected to provide a way to realize the diverse nature of MXene composites from a different perspective, and open new directions to find solutions for next-generation PV applications,” the scientists said.

The Eco Cute solution includes a heat pump and hot water storage unit that purportedly saves energy by maintaining bathwater temperatures at a constant level. It also helps homeowners to save energy at night by using heat from their bathwater. In addition, the device reduces energy and water use.
The product features a solar charging function that uses surplus electricity generated and stored from PV sources. It can use electricity to boil water during the night or day, said Panasonic.
The new product also has an “emergency boiling” function that is activated when disaster warnings or bad weather warnings are issued. This means the water continues to boil automatically, so the tank is always filled with hot water.
“Therefore, hot water can be secured in case of a power outage or water outage,” said Panasonic.
The new product was developed with Tepco Energy Partner, an electricity retailer owned by Japanese utility Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco). Panasonic said the heat pump is compatible with a new Tepco electricity rate plan for solar self-consumption.
“A normal heat pump water heater boils hot water at night, but the EcoCute product heats water with electricity generated in the daytime,” said Panasonic.

India installed 1.7GW of solar in 2021 – its highest-ever annual rooftop solar capacity additions to date.
Installations rose 210% year on year, according to a new report by Mercom India Research. The residential and commercial segments accounted for 35% and 33% of all installed rooftop solar capacity, respectively. Industrial rooftop solar installations accounted for 26% of the total, while the remaining 6% came from the government segment.
“The rooftop solar market in India had its best year, largely due to the pent-up demand from 2020, which experienced a severe decline due to Covid-19. Certainty around net metering regulation helped along with demand from consumers across all segments – residential, commercial, and Industrial. An increase in component costs will dent demand in 2022, but we still expect positive growth this year,” said Raj Prabhu, chief executive officer of Mercom Capital Group.
According to the report, India’s cumulative rooftop solar installations surpassed 7GW by Dec. 31, 2021. The state of Gujarat has the most installed rooftop solar capacity, followed by Maharashtra and Rajasthan.
Rooftop solar installations reached 402MW in the fourth quarter, down 10% from the 448MW added in the third quarter of 2021. However, fourth-quarter installations rose 41% year on year.
Mercom analysts said installations could have been higher in 2021 if not for price increases in components, commodities, and raw materials. The hike in the goods and services tax (GST) rate also dealt a big blow to installers.
Average rooftop solar system in 2021 cost 14.75% more than in the fourth quarter of 2020 as installers increased prices to match the 12% GST hike and high material costs.
