That would have been enough to install an additional 95 GW of solar capacity during the period, in terms of the industry's pre-supply-chain-shock prices, the Paris-based body has calculated.
As usual, the report presents a glass-half-full, glass-half empty appraisal, with the IEA anticipating the world will have installed a record volume of solar this year, spelling out how it would be possible to unlock an additional 25% of renewables plants on top of the huge volumes expected to 2026 … and then pointing out that would still not keep the world on track for net zero in 2050.
pv magazine Australia will be examining the outlook for large scale solar Down Under in a webinar on Wednesday. The team, with our partner Risen Energy Australia, will kick things off at 7 a.m. (CET) on Wednesday and you can sign up for the event here.
The international organization believes a record, near-160 GW of solar will have been added worldwide this year, with 17% more added than came online in 2020, and predicted the world will be adding 200 GW per year of photovoltaics in five years' time. Dealing with the familiar list of solar industry grumbles out to 2026 – sluggish permitting, grid integration issues, social acceptance, inconsistent policy, insufficient financial incentives, and costly developing-world finance – could raise that number to almost 260 GW per annum by the time the 2026 numbers are tallied, estimated the IEA.
The report's authors spell out the sort of effort required to achieve its ‘accelerated case' outlook for solar: China must define how its renewable portfolio standard – requiring generators to produce a specified volume of clean power – and the green certificates for renewable energy will function, and must support residential arrays after their feed-in tariff (FIT) is wound down this month. Even without those remedies, the IEA said, China will continue to lead the way with 1.2 TW of solar and wind capacity by 2026. That would be enough, wrote IEA executive director Fatih Birol, to ensure the nation “could well achieve a peak in its CO2 emissions well before 2030,” as a government target stipulates.
Elsewhere, to further ramp solar deployment, according to the IEA, the U.S. should extend the investment tax credit for solar; India should get the finances of its power companies in order, extend grids and better incentivize small-scale, ‘distributed-generation‘ arrays; the EU should smooth permitting rules for participation in big solar capacity auctions, and expand the ambition of the procurement rounds, and could also support rooftop systems with its post-Covid recovery and resilience funding; Japan must smooth the transition from FITs to premium payments topping up the wholesale electricity price; and governments in the Middle East and North Africa could hold capacity auctions more often and expand their grids faster.
Even if that perennial wish list remains unfulfilled, the report's authors stated, the world can be expected to add almost 1.1 TW of solar over the next five years.
In the best of all worlds for solar, however – an ‘accelerated-case' jamboree of friction-free permitting, bags of cash for rooftop solar, and grids accelerating at a rate of knots – the extra 25% of solar panels that would be installed would still have to double to keep the world on track for net zero in 2050.
And that's not to mention the IEA's fear a year of continued high panel prices – driven by more costly polysilicon, steel, copper, aluminum and shipping costs – could wipe out three year's worth of cost reductions, not to mention the threat of central banks raising interest rates and, thereby, project finance costs, or the plethora of trade measures imposed on solar imports. Those listed in the IEA study ranged from the duty slapped on solar panels by the U.S. in 2022 through to India's plan to apply a 40% duty on foreign panels and a 25% charge on solar cells, from April.
So the question remains, is our glass half-full or half-empty?

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/02/socomec-on-capturing-multiple-energy-storage-value-streams-resilience-in-power-supply/,"SPONSORED,WORLD",,"DECEMBER 2, 2021","Socomec on capturing multiple energy storage value streams, resilience in power supply","Gilles Ramzeyer, ESS Business Unit Director, Socomec: In the early stages of the business, the greatest demand was for remote microgrids, and we deployed containerized solutions all over the globe. About five years ago, our biggest demand was for on-grid storage, mostly in the U.S., because it represented a very lucrative investment. Today, the most relevant application for our customers is resilience in power supply. But we see demand for both functions together. From our perspective, we’ve come full circle. Today, customers want on-grid energy storage for economic returns, and they also want backup power when the grid may go down.
There are other important factors besides project economics. Decarbonization is very important, and energy storage can clearly help with that, especially when paired with photovoltaics. Still, economic returns are part of almost every conversation about energy storage, so it’s important to capture multiple value streams like Demand Charge Management, Time of Use Management, Capacity Resource payments, Tax credits, and state incentives, etc. It’s a long list.
We are also seeing increased interest in energy storage to support electric vehicle charging. Here also, it’s a question of multiple revenue streams, the systems need to capture as many revenue streams as possible, while they support an EV charging installation. As the green energy transformation continues, there will almost certainly be new applications, and we will do our best to address them as they arise.
Storage systems are expensive assets that can generate substantial savings depending on usage. It is, therefore, necessary to prioritize deployment for profitable applications, to guarantee owners a maximization of revenues and a fast return on investment.
We have thus targeted three main applications:
It’s not so much about “trendy”, as it is an effort to design the next generation of products to address what the market is really looking for. Our offer is an outdoor system based on two main cabinets: C-Cab, a converter based on 50kVA power modules; and B-Cab, a 186kWh battery – both of which are really flexible and can allow a high variety of configurations.
Clearly, safety must be a top priority. So, we had a non-negotiable requirement at the beginning that our battery partner had to have a strong result on the UL’s new large-scale fire test before we would even begin commercial discussions.
The next thing is that the system had to deliver superior throughput. It’s a common shorthand in this industry to compare products on dollars per nameplate kilowatt-hour basis when what really matters is the lifetime throughput of each of those nameplate kilowatt-hours. In other words, how many MWh can be delivered over the life of the system?
We also knew that we needed a service structure that would allow a commercial & industrial (C&I) energy storage system to freely do the variety of things they really do in the field. Most systems bigger than residential sizes are for the utility market, where the systems will do mostly the same thing, on most days. C&I is very different, in that the systems may do very different things on different days to capture the maximum value, and the system warranty linked to the maintenance offer has to allow for this great variety in operation.
Safety is always the top priority, so it makes sense to do as much of the assembly in the factory and have a bare minimum of assembly in the field. At the same time, the modules are small enough to be moved about the job site with large forklifts.
Doing more of the assembly in the factory makes for a more rapid installation. The battery cabinets, for example, arrive fully assembled. The battery modules are already in their racks, and all the wiring inside is already in place. The install crew has little to do beyond bolting the cabinet to the pad and running the DC and comms cables to the converter.
The last difference is flexibility, and we’re hearing this is even more important than we’d thought. There’s a great variety of real-world projects, and the ideal system size also varies from project to project. Our solution is based on a fully-integrated conversion cabinet that integrates not only conversion but also all the control, communication, IoT devices for remote access as well as protection devices. Each cabinet can be filled with up to six power modules of 50kVA each, so the cabinet can reach up to 300kVA.
This power can be increased by putting two cabinets in parallel per system. The batteries can also be installed in parallel from one cabinet – 186kWh – to six cabinets – 1116kWh per system. After systems can be installed in parallel as well. So, we are able to offer our customers dozens of different combinations of kilowatts and kilowatt-hours, our systems being able to reach the ideal size for each project.  That keeps costs down, and savings up.  It also means that our footprint is often much smaller too.
We’ve been in the power conversion business since the moon landings, as we’ve been building uninterruptable power supplies or UPSs, since 1969. We are also known for our measuring and switching solutions. It’s good to have people on our team that have been designing and manufacturing these for decades. That experience enabled us to branch into energy storage about a decade ago.
We started out building pre-packaged microgrids, to be sent to the far corners of the globe. In some of these places, we are the local grid – so these simply must work. The experience of building all those microgrids permeates all we do. At the same time, our UPS business gives us economies of scale, allowing us to manufacture energy storage systems of high quality, in industrial quantities.
The North American market is the most dynamic market on the planet right now, so of course, we find it to be quite interesting. All the new products are designed to meet the latest North American standards, including the additional requirements for the biggest markets, like California and Hawaii. But we will always be an international company, so we also offer energy storage in IEC configurations for Europe and the rest of the world too. As the green energy transformation continues, there will be new markets opening around the world with new requirements, and we will be watching closely, and adapting our products accordingly.

Some 490 MW of the total 607 MW generation capacity of the Ibri II project consists of TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivated contact) bifacial solar panels supplied by Jolywood, the company said today.
Via the UP Initiative, pv magazine is diving deep into the topic of what it means to be truly sustainable in the solar industry; looking at what is already being done, and discussing areas for improvement. Quarterly themes have thus far covered the use of lead in solar, raw material sourcing for batteries, green finance, circular manufacturing, PV module recycling, agriPV, and workers’ rights. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
Oman's largest solar project, near Ibri, the capital of Dhahirah governorate, covers around 1,154 acres, cost $400 million and began generating last month, according to Jolywood. It was developed by a consortium of Saudi Arabian, 50% state-owned developer ACWA Power, which will own half of the project; the Gulf Investment Corp owned by the governments of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi and the UAE, which will hold 40%; and clean energy developer Alternative Energy Projects Co (AEPC), in which the ruling family of Kuwait is the majority shareholder. The AEPC has a 10% stake. ACWA Power, on its website, describes the Ibri II project as costing $395 million and having a generation capacity of 500 MWac and Jolywood, in May last year, described the facility as having a total capacity of 575 MW. In January, the company told pv magazine the project would have a total capacity of 500 MW.
The 1.3 TWh the facility is expected to generate annually will be bought by state entity the Oman Power and Water Procurement Company and should be able to power up to 33,000 homes in the sultanate.
Jolywood said it had been chosen to supply panels to the project because of its products' ability to operate in harsh conditions including windy sand which can cause wind erosion, and huge temperature differences in desert areas.
The manufacturer said its J-TOPCon 2.0 Niwa solar module offers bifaciality of more than 80% and added, a third party which tested its equipment had certified the modules offered a 16% power output gain versus rival products operating in desert environments.
With a low temperature coefficient of -0.32%/W, Jolywood said its Niwa bifacial panels reduce degradation and risk caused by high operating temperatures so the module can operate normally at 70 degrees Celsius.
The Chinese business said it had worked with German brand Munich Re to offer a 12-year warranty for materials and workmanship and a 30-year linear performance guarantee.
Jolywood VP Liu Zhifeng said: “Although the construction schedule of the project was seriously affected by Covid-19, [the] Jolywood team [overcame] many difficulties and completed the delivery of customer products as [per] the agreement, and [provided] professional technical services and support for the project, so that the project was successfully put into operation [on] schedule.”
The solar manufacturer claims to have delivered more than 5 GW of TOPCon cells and modules, with 1 GW of them shipped to the Middle East.

Shunfeng had agreed to sell the projects to Chongqing Future Investment Co Ltd on December 16, 2015, just 11 days after opening a line of credit with Chongqing worth up to RMB1.5 billion (US$236 million).
On the day the sale agreement was signed, Shunfeng drew down an initial RMB700 million in loans from Chongqing and used RMB294 million (US$46.2 million) to pay itself and other creditors sums owed to them by the project companies which were set to transferred. Five days later, Shunfeng repaid RMB200 million (US$31.4 million) back to the lender.

Contact up@pv-magazine.com to learn more.
When the proposed solar project sale fell through, the parties signed a termination agreement, on June 21, 2016, which committed Chongqing to transferring the shares in the projects back to Shunfeng upon receipt of RMB650 million from the latter, plus a further sum stipulated by the terms of the walkaway deal.
Shunfeng subsequently devoted RMB400 million of the RMB700 million (US$110 million) it had initially drawn down from Chongqing towards the RMB650 million it had to hand over after the deal collapsed, but the cash-strapped developer told the Hong Kong Stock Exchange today, RMB33.5 million (US$5.26 million) of that return fee remains to be settled.
On September 25, 2017, Chongqing and Shunfeng subsidiary Shanghai Shunneng agreed that the stock in the holding company of the solar projects, plus five of the nine project companies themselves, be pledged to Chongqing to guarantee Shunfeng honor its debts to the latter.
With that arrangement in place, Shunfeng borrowed a further RMB750 million from Chongqing four days later, and immediately used RMB500 million (US$78.5 million) of it to settle principal and interest owed from the previous loan.
On September 30 last year, the monies owed by the solar developer to Chongqing – amounting to RMB666 million (US$105 million) – became overdue. The solution settled upon by Chongqing, it was announced yesterday, is to force the sale of all nine solar project companies to Xinjiang Silu Qianyuan Energy Co Ltd in a cash and stock deal worth RMB1.1 billion (US$173 million), with cash making up RMB686 million of the purchase price.
That is around RMB651 million less than the book value of the projects but would remove liabilities of RMB990 million (US$155 million) from Shunfeng's books. The value of the deal will also leave a cash surplus of RMB356 million (US$55.9 million) over and above what Shunfeng owes Chongqing.
The RMB666 million owed by Shunfeng to Chongqing is similar to the HK$800 million (US$103 million) it has owed Sino Alliance since the end of last year. The last statement of Shunfeng's borrowings issued indicated the developer has owed HK$172 million (US$22 million) to True Bold Global Ltd since November 2019; HK$351 million (US$45 million), also to Sino Alliance, since the end of 2019; and RMB330 million to investors in a 2015 corporate bond, since March last year. The company missed a deadline, on October 25, to repay RMB255 million (US$40 million) owed to backers of a 2016 corporate bond, and the deadline for settlement of HK$175 million owed to Rainbow Fort Investments was due to expire two days ago.
The company – which is hoping to sell off seven different solar projects, with a generation capacity of 283 MW – also has to find HK$300 million (US$38.5 million) for China Minsheng Banking Corp by the end of the year.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/12/02/mauritius-unveils-new-home-and-business-rooftop-solar-programs/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,MAURITIUS",MAX HALL,"DECEMBER 2, 2021",Mauritius unveils new home and business rooftop solar programs,"Mauritius' state-owned electric utility has opened two schemes to drive the deployment of up to 20 MW of household and commercial PV systems, with half of it linked to the home and business charging of electric vehicles (EVs).
In line with pledges made in the national budget speech in the summer, the Central Electricity Board (CEB) has opened a household solar program which will pay for all the electricity generated by rooftop arrays with a generation capacity of up to 5 kWp; and an EV-linked scheme open to domestic and commercial customers, which has a 10 kWp DC maximum system size.
Pick up the latest edition of pv magazine to read about the many software solutions driving the energy transition. From big data and artificial intelligence taking the hard work out of operations and monitoring, to the move toward international standards and a consensus in ensuring electricity networks are secured against cyber attacks and other digital threats; the bits and bytes of software solutions play a complex and central role in the energy system.
Each program aims to allocate 10 MW of generation capacity, to help the government towards its aims of securing 35% of its electricity from renewables by 2025, and 60% by 2030.
In each case, all of the electricity generated by the solar systems will be bought by the utility for MUR3.73/kWh ($0.083) in this fiscal year, with that tariff to be re-evaluated annually over a 20-year payment period. In cases where grid electricity is already supplied to the consumer at a lower price, the tariff paid will be calculated from the difference between the two figures, weighted according to how much electricity is generated by the solar panels and how much grid power is used by the home or business.
The CEB trails the fact all power or, in the case of EV charging, excess power, will be exported to the grid under the ‘gross metering‘ approach – without any self-consumption – as a positive aspect of the program as it ensures consumers will not have to buy an energy storage system.
With the EV-linked program already open, the CEB yesterday opened the application process for its household solar scheme. Non-commercial users of the EV-linked system will be eligible for time-of-use electricity tariffs at some stage, the CEB stated on its website, although the details of the tariffs has yet to be worked out.
The electric company said the purchase of solar arrays could be financed through ‘green' loans offered by local banks thanks to funding from French development agency the AFD (Agence française de développement) or with 2%, concessionary-rate loans offered by the Development Bank of Mauritius up to a value of MUR100,000 ($2,240). With a MUR2,000 ($45) registration fee applying to the two programs, the CEB said “eligible customers” could deduct the full cost of solar systems from their income tax bill under the government's Solar Energy Investment Allowance.
The two solar deployment initiatives follow the introduction of a 60 MW program by the utility in October which was aimed at incentivizing renewable energy projects with generation capacities of up to 15 MW, to be developed by public sector entities.
If fully subscribed, the three programs could drive 80 MW of new solar capacity in a nation which had only 83 MW of grid-connected solar a year ago, according to an International Renewable Energy Agency estimate.

Solar cells based on DJ perovskites, however, have shown comparatively poor performance compared to their 3D counterparts.
Researchers at Nankai University in China recently developed a DJ two-dimensional perovskite solar cell. They claim it exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 18.82%, as well as remarkable light, thermal, environmental, and operational stability.
“(The) 2D or quasi-2D perovskites have better environmental and structure stability in comparison with 3D perovskites,” researcher Yongsheng Liu told pv magazine. “We mainly focused on improving the device stability and efficiency using a conjugated organic spacer.”
The researchers presented their results in “Highly Efficient and Stable Dion−Jacobson Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Extended π-Conjugation of Organic Spacer,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials. The cell was built with a spacer made of fused-thiophene, also known as formula thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2,5-diyldimethanaminium iodide (TTDMAI), as the bulky organic spacer for the 2D DJ perovskite.
“The TTDMA spacer with extended π-conjugation length exhibits high film quality, large crystal size and preferred crystal vertical orientation induced by the large crystal nuclei in precursor solution, resulting in lower trap density, reduced exciton binding energy and oriented charge transport,” the scientists said in their paper. A conjugated system is a system with p orbitals with delocalized electrons in a molecule, with the p orbitals lowering the overall energy of the molecule and increasing stability.
They fabricated the cell with an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) layer, a hole transporting material based on PEDOT:PSS, a perovskite layer, an electron acceptor made of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and a silver (Ag) metal contact.
The research team took dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements to analyze the impact of the extended π-conjugation length of the spacer on film morphology and crystal growth orientation of the perovskite films. They found that large grains size with enhanced crystallinity and vertical orientation were formed, which resulted in improved film quality.
Further analysis confirmed these results and showed that the better crystal orientation should be attributed to the strong intermolecular interaction of organic spacer, which is said to stabilize and tighten the framework and induce crystal growth with enlarged grain sizes. The solar cell showed a power conversion efficiency of 18.82%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.03 V, a short circuit current of 22.38 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 81.64%.
“The high efficiency could be attributed to the enlarged short-circuit current and fill factor thanks to the high film quality of TTDMA-Pb film with large grain size and vertical crystal,” the researchers said. 
They also looked at the stability of the device and found, through a nitrogen-filled glove box, that it can retain 94% of its  original efficiencies after 740 hours.
“The remarkable stability could be attributed to the intrinsic structure stability of 2D DJ perovskites with aromatic spacers,” Liu said, adding that more work needs to be done to reach industry-scalable PV applications.

Tata Power Solar Systems, India’s largest private-sector, integrated solar company, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Power, has received a letter of award from state body the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) for the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) of an INR945 crore ($126 million), 100 MW solar project with a 120 MWh battery in Chhattisgarh.
The project is set for completion within 18 months. Tata Power Solar’s work scope includes engineering, design, supply, construction, erection, testing, commissioning, and operation and maintenance of the facilities.
Tata says its utility scale EPC order book now stands at 4.4 GWdc of generation capacity with an approximate value of more than $1.2 billion, emphasizing its position as India’s leading solar EPC.
The latest win has strengthened Tata Power Solar’s battery storage portfolio in the renewables segment. The company is already executing a 50 MW solar project with a 50 MWh battery in the Leh district of the Indian union territory of Ladakh.
Tata Power chief executive and MD Praveer Sinha said: “We are glad to receive this prestigious order from SECI to build solar EPC projects, along with India's largest utility scale BESS [battery energy storage system] project. This is the second grid scale solar plant with BESS [built by Tata Power Solar] and is recognition of Tata Power Solar’s pioneering work in project execution capabilities in the solar energy domain.”
The company has a portfolio of more than 7 GW of ground-mounted utility scale solar capacity and more than 750 MW of rooftop and other small scale generation projects in India. It has installed more than 55,000 solar water pumps in the nation. Tata Power Solar has a solar manufacturing unit in Bangalore which has an annual production capacity of 580 MW of modules and 530 MW of cells.

The battery's special feature is a new kind of electrode made of a mixture containing dispersed manganese dioxide (MnO2) particles, shot through with an electrically conductive additive, carbon black. The latter was used to add the pigment and the electric punch to the semisolid compound.
“This compound reacts with a conductive zinc solution or zinc plate at the stack, enabling efficient electrochemical energy conversion,” the scientists said. “The fluid properties of this battery are far removed from the watery solutions used by other flow batteries.”
The battery went through tests that showed that it offers an optimal electrochemical mix.
“These systems have to be able to flow under reasonable pressures, but also have a weak yield stress so that the active MnO2 particles don't sink to the bottom of the flow tanks when the system isn’t being used, as well as not separate into a battery/oily clear fluid phase and a dense paste of carbon particles and MnO2,” said researcher Gareth McKinley.
The scientists were surprised by the results of a techno-economic analysis that compared the performance of the battery with an equivalent electrochemical battery and hydrogen backup.
“We performed a comprehensive, bottom-up analysis to understand how the battery’s composition affects performance and cost, looking at all the trade-offs,” said researcher Thaneer Malai Narayanan. “We showed that our system can be cheaper than others, and can be scaled up.”
According to the research, when the compared batteries discharge for more than 24 hours, the semisolid flow battery beats out lithium-ion batteries and vanadium redox flow batteries. “This was true even when factoring in the heavy expense of pumping the MnO2 slurry from tank to stack,” they said.
“The next step is to take our battery system and build it up,” added Narayanan. “Our research also points the way to other chemistries that could be developed under the semi-solid flow battery platform, so we could be seeing this kind of technology used for energy storage in our lifetimes.”
The researchers described the battery in “Low-cost manganese dioxide semi-solid electrode for flow batteries,” which was recently published in Joule.

“At present … self-consumption projects developed by third parties for commercial and industrial clients are not widely spread in Russia, due to a few reasons,” a company's spokesperson told pv magazine. “First, not many commercial and industrial clients pay high tariffs for electricity. Second, there is a regulatory risk in [the] case of a self-consumption project – if it is structured as a pure PPA – that even in [the] case the plant is on-site, the regulators will enforce to pay [an electricity] transportation charge and, in such case[s], a project becomes become economically not viable.”
The solar array will cover around 30% of the electricity needs of a Leroy Merlin hypermarket in Volzhsky, in Russia's Volgograd region. Leroy Merlin said it might build similar facilities in other cities in southern Russia.
At the end of April, three solar-linked bilateral deals had been sealed in Russia. These deals, however, differ substantially from the deal secured by Vershina, as they imply the use of the power network.
According to Anton Usachev, president of the Russian Solar Energy Association, the three bilateral agreements involved Anglo-Dutch multinational consumer goods company Unilever, Belgian brewing giant AB InBev, and Russian state-owned lender PJSC Sberbank. “Voluntary bilateral agreements follow the same mechanisms as green certificates and are similar to PPAs in their basic form,” Usachev said at the time. “They are concluded between an independent power producer and a buyer searching for consumption of electricity generated by renewables for its manufacturing facility.”
The group of Austrian companies includes Soge Solar Generation Holding GmbH, Terawatt Holding GmbH, Eco Energy Rus Holding GmbH, and Energoeffect Holding GmbH. The EPC contractor for the project is Vershina Engineering LLC.
*The article was amended on December 3 to reflect that the deal secured by Vershina differ substantially from the bilateral deals awarded by Unilever, AB InBev, and PJSC Sberbank.

A 3 GW green hydrogen facility planned for Queensland, Australia, could be powered by solar PV after state-owned Stanwell Corporation and Acciona Energia, a subsidiary of Spanish conglomerate Acciona, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on future energy supply for proposed hydrogen production and export.
Stanwell has teamed with a consortium of Australian and Japanese energy companies to develop a large-scale electrolysis plant at Aldoga, about 20 kilometers north-west of Gladstone, with the view to producing green hydrogen for export to Japan and use in local industry. Since the CQ-H2 project was unveiled, land has been secured at Aldoga, a planning study completed, a feasibility study announced, and now an MoU has been signed that allows for a direct connection to be established between the hydrogen production facility and Acciona’s proposed Aldoga Solar Farm.
Originally slated as a 250 MW project, the Aldoga Solar Farm is expected to reach a capacity of 600 MWp after Acciona recently received approval from the Queensland government for a significant expansion of the project.
Acciona Energia Managing Director Brett Wickham said the company was excited to provide the Stanwell-led CQ-H2 consortium with “renewable energy supply to their innovative hydrogen project.”
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the agreement marked a major milestone for the CQ-H2 consortium which includes Japanese companies Iwatani Corporation, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Kansai Electric Power Company and Marubeni, and Australian energy infrastructure business APA Group.
“A direct connection would see Queensland’s largest solar project providing clean and renewable energy to Queensland’s largest renewable hydrogen project,” he said.
The proposed CQ-H2 green hydrogen project is expected to commence production in the mid-2020s with the project to scale up to more than 3 GW of electrolysis capacity by the early 2030s.
The project, which has attracted financial support from the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), aims to produce up to 36,500 tons per annum of renewable hydrogen and export to Japan from 2026, scaling up to 328,500 tons per annum in 2031 to meet forecast demand.
Stanwell CEO Michael O’Rourke said the MoU would allow for the consortium to push ahead with its plans but said more renewable energy will be needed to deliver the project in full.
“We will leverage the direct connection to the Aldoga Solar Farm to power stage one of the proposed CQ-H2 hydrogen facility,” he said. “(But) our proposed facility will require substantially higher quantities of renewable energy to support the development of stage two.”
The Aldoga Solar Farm is due to commence construction in September 2023, with generation output scheduled to commence in December 2025.

Malta, developer of electro-thermal energy storage systems, announced its partnership with Bechtel, an engineering, construction and project management firm.
Malta’s system, developed in partnership with Siemens Energy, is energy-source agnostic, able to collect and store energy from solar, wind, or fossil fuels. Its long-duration capability of 10-150+ hours is particularly well-suited to support renewable energy, storing and dispatching power during the intermittent cycles of generation (day to night), and can perform other grid services.
First, energy is gathered, and then moved through a heat pump, converting electrical energy into thermal energy by creating a temperature difference. The heat is stored in molten salt, and the cold is stored in a chilled liquid. When it is time to dispatch the power, the temperature difference is converted back to electrical energy with a heat engine. Finally, it is distributed back to the grid as needed.
“The lack of long-duration energy storage solutions remains a key challenge for the renewable energy industry,” said Bechtel renewables sector lead Scott Austin. “There is no silver bullet for decarbonization.” A similar sentiment was shared in the pv magazine Roundtables USA 2021 session, where it was discussed that a mix of distributed generation and shorter duration storage with large-scale renewable deployment and long-duration storage would offer the fastest path to decarbonization.
Malta said its solution has applications in replacing retired fossil-fuel assets like coal-fired power plants, with the ability to reuse existing infrastructure. Additionally, it can be used as an alternative to transmission system updates, also using existing infrastructure, said the company.
