German storage system manufacturer Tesvolt has launched a storage system for commercial applications that integrates an inverter and an energy management system. The TS-I HV 80 battery, according to the company, is able to shave load peaks thanks to registering load profile measurement, optimizing self-consumption, and supplying back-up power.
The device can operate both in off and on-grid mode and is claimed to be black-start capable. It is also said to react to power requirements from the power network within milliseconds and to be suitable for recharging electric cars.
“The integrated energy management system is essentially the brains of the storage system,” said Thomas Scholz, EMS product manager at Tesvolt. “It captures the energy flows of all consumers and generators and controls them as efficiently as possible–in real time.”
The manufacturer said the new device should better adapt to the individual needs of commercial and industrial customers and save more electricity costs. However, no specific figures were provided. “There are so many different applications for the new storage system that it is difficult to quantify the cost savings,” the company told pv magazine.
In addition, according to Tesvolt, the so-called power quality technology ensures good and uniform power quality. This means that voltage and frequency are stabilized and unbalanced load, reactive power, and harmonics in the power grid of the commercial customer, are reduced. “We achieve this via an active line filter and thus have a real unique selling point on the market,” said Tesvolt product manager Christian Löffler.
Tesvolt CEO Daniel Hannemann told pv magazine that the improved power quality should extend the service life of the battery, which is why the storage system could quickly pay off for industrial companies–within five years. According to the company, the TS-I HV 80 is available from 76 kWh and can be modularly expanded to several megawatt-hours. The integrated three-phase inverter has an output of 75 kW. In addition, the storage system delivers up to 340 kW on a footprint of just half a square meter, and requires little space.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/01/gcl-poly-continues-to-ramp-production-capacity-commitments/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",MAX HALL,"MARCH 1, 2021",GCL-Poly continues to ramp production capacity commitments,"Polysilicon maker GCL-Poly on Sunday announced it will be the majority partner in a RMB18 billion (US$2.79 billion) project to develop a new factory in Inner Mongolia.
The announcement came despite the fact the manufacturer recently suffered a cross default and on Friday was forced to slash the price of concessional shares offered as incentives to employees, because of the travails of its stock price.
GCL said it will hold a 65% stake in a planned joint venture with PV applications company Shangji Automation Co Ltd to develop a 300,000-ton-annual-production-capacity facility in the Chinese autonomous region.
The fab will developed in three stages, starting with a RMB3.6 billion first phase. GCL-Poly stated the 65-35 split in the JV would not necessarily indicate how the projected investment would be weighted. Such ratios would require RMB2.34 billion from GCL for the first phase of an eventual RMB11.7 billion commitment.
The announcement was made on the same day the company revealed details of a further RMB1.95 billion of commitments related to the development of a 60,000-ton-capacity poly production line in Leshan City, Sichuan.
An update published on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Sunday, and dated Friday, explained a complex workaround which will involve GCL-Poly subsidiary Zhongneng Polysilicon Technology Development Co Ltd surrendering majority ownership of the project company associated with that planned fab–Sumin New Energy Technology Co Ltd. GCL also made fresh commitments to the Zhongping Polysilicon Photovoltaic Information Industry Investment Fund Partnership (Limited Partnership) of which it is a partner.
Under the arrangement, GCL subsidiary Zhongneng will raise RMB600 million from selling 3.848% of its 9.623% stake in polysilicon business Zhonghuan-GCL to the fund–to which it has already agreed to contribute RMB1.5 billion. As part of the deal, the fund can require the GCL unit to buy back the stake if Zhonghuan-GCL is not sold off to a third party within five years.
GCL-owned Leshan polysilicon fab project company Sumin New Energy will see 86.67% of its ownership pass to the fund for a nominal RMB1 (US$0.15) as part of the arrangement. The fund will, in return, raise its contribution to Sumin New Energy's registered capital from RMB1.3 billion to RMB1.9 billion. At the same time, GCL-owned Zhongneng agreed to raise its contribution to Sumin New Energy from RMB200 million to RMB1 billion. The Guangyang Technology Development Partnership held on behalf of Zhongneng by two of the latter's employees, also agreed to contribute RMB245 million to the polysilicon project company.
GCL's heavily-indebted solar project business GCL New Energy on Friday announced the proposed cancellation of 214 million share options, provided the non-director grantees who have thus far failed to take up the options agree. The company has already secured agreement from grantees to cancel a separate 141 million of share options because the prices at which employees could have bought the stock–HK$1.1798 (US$0.15) or HK$0.606 (US$0.08)–were significantly more costly than the price available on the open market.
GCL New Energy has instead issued 381 million new share options at a discount price of HK$0.00416 (US$0.0005).

Germany’s federal network agency, the Bundesnetzagentur, has reported 536 MW of new PV systems were registered in January, marking a slight increase from December, when new additions totaled 525 MW; and a slight drop from January 2020, when newly installed PV capacity was 579 MW.
Most of the December capacity–493.3 MW–comes from PV systems not exceeding 750 kW in size, of which 406 MW is represented by PV systems under the country's FIT scheme and 87.3 MW of projects selected through tenders that have not been awarded feed-in premium payments. Furthermore, the Bundesnetzagentur registered the grid connection of 43 MW of projects selected through tenders that have been awarded feed-in premium payments.
The cumulative capacity of all subsidized PV systems in Germany reached 54.1 GW at the end of January.
Starting from today, tariffs for PV systems will fall 1.4%. The FIT for rooftop systems of up to 10 kW capacity will fall under the €0.08/kWh threshold for the first time, to reach €0.0792/kWh. The payment for installations with a capacity between 10 and 40 kW will be €0.077/kWh.
Systems with a capacity of 40-100 kW will receive €0.0604/kWh from today. The payment for projects with a 40-750 kW capacity will be €0.0544/kWh. For other systems up to 100 kW in size, there is a fixed FIT of €0.04/kWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/01/pumped-hydro-with-desalination-powered-by-renewables/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHILE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 1, 2021","Pumped hydro with desalination, powered by renewables","Oceanus Energía y Agua de Sudamerica SpA, a unit of US infrastructure developer Oceanus Power & Water, has signed a deal with French energy giant EDF to build the world's first integrated pumped hydro reverse osmosis clean energy system (IPHROCES).
The project, which will be built at an unspecified location in Chile's Andes region, will combine a pumped hydro storage station that uses saltwater with a desalination system to be powered by wind and solar. The system will pump seawater into a storage reservoir at an upper level using conventional reversible pump-turbines, based on power produced by on-site renewable energy facilities or grid electricity.
The water in the upper reservoir will be sent back to the shore, where the reverse osmosis system is located, and used to produce freshwater. The water that is not used for desalination purposes will be used to produce hydropower for between eight and 12 hours per day during peak demand periods, with fast response times.
“This hydraulic pressure eliminates the need for additional electricity to be provided to drive the desalination facility, greatly reducing both the capital expenditure and operational expenditure associated with standalone desalination facilities,” Oceanus said.
This process purportedly offers better brine management, as pumped storage outflows dilute desalination waste brine. The system also has a better energy footprint, as it reduces reverse osmosis energy consumption, Oceanus claimed.
“The result is a low salinity concentration mixture that is sent back to the ocean, minimizing the impacts on marine life,” the company said.
In a report of the Chilean Ministry of Finance in 2018, Oceanus said that the energy consumption of the system would be the lowest in the market for reverse osmosis. The reverse osmosis process starts with around 400 pounds per square inch (PSI) of pressure, without the need for pumps.
The system will purportedly produce freshwater at a lower cost than other desalination projects that rely on reverse osmosis, due to lower operational costs, Oceanus said. It said that its pumped storage solution will generate power at peak times, with response times of less than five minutes, in order to ensure network stability.
“The integration of these technologies results in significant economic and environmental benefits that cannot be profitably achieved independently,” Oceanus said. “The IPHROCES concept is well suited to helping regions and countries proactively address some of the growing challenges posed by climate change, on a large scale and without the need for new, unproven, expensive technologies.”
Joan Leal, president of Oceanus Sudamerica, said that he has long wanted to deploy IPHROCES in Latin America to address water shortages.
“IPHROCES can significantly benefit the region by providing low-cost clean water and renewable energy, as well as helping to reactivate the local economy and create jobs,” he said.

The novel material is composed of porous nanostructured microspheres made of copper, iron, and iron oxide with the formula Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4.
The microspheres were synthesized through a one-step spray pyrolysis method, which is a technique used for temperature decomposition of organic material in the absence of oxygen. This process is known for providing excellent rate capability and high cycling stability and is used in the chemical industry to produce ethylene, carbon, and chemicals from petroleum, coal, and even wood, as well as to produce coke from coal.
An aqueous solution with ions of the special metals was converted into fog through an ultrasound technique and the water was evaporated at 1200 degrees Celsius, which decomposed the original metal salts. The process enabled the formation of micron or submicron spheres with the levels of porosity that are required for lithium-ion storage.
The new anode material is claimed to provide three times more capacity than current commercially available batteries and increase the number of charge-discharge cycles by five times compared to other promising alternatives to graphite. “This improvement is achieved due to a synergistic effect with a combination of a special nanostructure and the composition of used elements,” said researcher Evgeny Kolesnikov.
“The synergistic effect among the different cations, as well as the nano-dimension coupled with a hollow interior and surface porosity of the electrode materials, not only facilitate li-ion and electron transportation kinetics but also accommodate large volume expansion,” the research team explained. No information was provided on the cost of the novel material and the manufacturing process.
The new material was presented in the study Hollow-structured Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 as a novel negative electrode material for high-performance lithium-ion batteries, published in the Journal of Alloys and Compounds. The members of the research team came from Russia's National University of Science and Technology (NUST), the Seoul National University of Science and Technology in Korea, India's SRM Institute of Science and Technology, and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

The latest statistics revealed 8.9 GW of approved projects are sitting in the grid-connection queue, including 3 GW with grid-connection approvals.
The Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Occitanie, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Côte d´Azur regions accounted for 63% of the newly connected power in the country in 2020. These are the four regions with the highest installed capacities, representing 69% of the total solar power connected in France at the end of 2020.
Last year, production from solar photovoltaic sources amounted to 12.9 TWh, compared to 11.6 TWh in 2019. This sharp increase is mainly due to excess sunshine in France in April and May, in addition to the increase in installed capacity. Solar production currently represents 2.9% of French electricity consumption, an increase of 0.4% compared to that of the previous year.

The scientists used titanium sheets with 99.4% purity, 1 mm thickness, and a length of 50 mm. The cell was fabricated with a two-step electrochemical anodization process and was then encapsulated with Cs nanoparticles, after being doped with a Cs-based solution. The C2-TiO2 nanotubes were then annealed at 450 C. The solar cell is based on methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3),  which is a perovskite with high photoluminescence quantum yield.
The researchers fabricated the nanotubes with a regular, ordered structure, which they say is necessary to achieve high levels of power conversion efficiency in the solar cell. This efficiency is proportional to the length of the nanotubes themselves.
“If the nanotube length is in between 1 micrometer (μm) to 20 μm then the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) increases and reaches up to 80% at 20 μm length resulting in an increase in the efficiency of perovskite solar cells,” they said, adding that 20 μm is a reasonable distance for an electron to travel and to achieve higher efficiency.
The academics said that the metal ions of the dopant material they used to produce the nanotubes have a better ability to accept electrons.
“The doped metal can easily trap the conduction electrons enabling the reduction in electron-hole pair recombination,” they said.
They used ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) to compare the performance of their solar cell with a similar cell designed with TiO2 nanotubes without Cs doping. The thermal performance of the two devices was measured through thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The thermal assessment showed that the doped nanotubes have excellent thermal stability under temperatures ranging up to 800 C. They also found that they lose roughly 1% of their weight at around 150 C.
The analysis showed that cesium atom doping effectively facilitates electron transport by reducing recombination reactions. The researchers said that the Cs-TiO2 based perovskite solar cell exhibited superior performance, resulting in an 18.67% jump in short-circuit current and a 22.28% increase in power conversion efficiency from the reference cell. “The doping process can be performed at a low cost, as we used an optimized concentration of cesium of only 0.05 M,” research principal author, H.M. Asif Javed, told pv magazine.
“The improvement in solar cell parameters can be attributed to enhanced extraction of the photo-generated charge carriers in the device,” the researchers concluded.
They described the cell in “Encapsulation of TiO2 nanotubes with Cs nanoparticles to enhance electron injection and thermal stability of perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Surfaces and Interfaces. The research team included scientists from Pakistan's University of Agriculture Faisalabad and the National University of Sciences and Technology, China's Xi'an Jiao Tong University and Jiangsu University, and King Saud University in Saudi Arabia.

IKEA said last week that it has completed a 1.35 MW solar carport at one of its locations in Baltimore, Maryland, and plans to build seven more similar projects at other U.S. stores, in partnership with New York-based Distributed Solar Development­­ (DSD).
The solar carports will help IKEA move toward its goal of being powered by 100% renewable energy, while also increasing energy efficiency by 2025. DSD designed and built the Baltimore carport. Initial results indicate the location has seen an 84% decrease in its purchased energy requirement between September and December 2020, equating to a 57% cost savings for the store.
The Baltimore project is the first of eight projects totaling 7 MW that DSD will develop for IKEA stores in Maryland and California. The other arrays are on track to be done this year. In January, DSD closed on a $300 million debt facility financed by Credit Suisse. It also hinted that it will have more deals to announce in the near future.
The solar carports are expected to generate a total of 10.7 GWh of electricity per year. Five of the projects include energy storage systems, with a collective capacity of about 5 MWh.
In the United States, the company currently owns 104 wind turbines, two geothermal properties, 240,784 solar panels, and 143 electric vehicle charging stations across 51 properties. Last year, Ingka Group, a partner in the IKEA franchise system, committed more than $700 million to support the shift to a net-zero carbon economy. As part of these efforts, Ingka Group has invested in two solar parks, totaling 403 MW of capacity, in Utah and Texas.

Infrastructure Australia, the Australian government’s independent infrastructure adviser, has formally recognized the world’s biggest solar and storage project – a planned 13 GW solar farm and 27 GWh battery storage facility.
The proposed project, which will generate, store and transmit solar energy to domestic and international markets, was included on Infrastructure Australia’s annual Infrastructure Priority Initiative List last week. In announcing the project’s inclusion, Infrastructure Australia acknowledged the potential for large-scale solar generation to transform the energy landscape in northern Australia. It said the Northern Territory has a distinct advantage when it comes to utility-scale renewable energy projects, noting the territory’s large land mass, solar resource, and proximity to other Indo-Pacific energy markets.
“There is an opportunity to harness this advantage by developing large-scale, dispatchable renewable energy generation in the Northern Territory, with transmission infrastructure to supply domestic and export markets,” Infrastructure Australia said.
The proposed Australia-ASEAN Power Link includes a 13 GW solar farm to be developed on a 12,000-hectare site at Powell Creek, near Elliott in the Northern Territory. If built, it will be coupled with 27 GWh of battery storage. The project is expected to supply power to the Darwin region and to Singapore via a 4,500 km high-voltage direct-current transmission network, including a 750-kilometer overhead transmission line, from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800-km submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore, via Indonesia.
Sun Cable said it was “delighted” the project has been added to the priority list and said its inclusion is consistent with the 2019 Australian Infrastructure Audit, which found Australia could develop new industries based on renewable energy, including large-scale solar and wind.
“There is an opportunity to harness abundant renewable energy resources for domestic electricity supply, growing Australia’s capacity to contribute to the whole global value chain of renewable electricity, including zero emissions manufacturing, as well as creating an intercontinental renewable electricity transmission export industry for Australia,” said Sun Cable CEO David Griffin. “Sun Cable’s vision is to create a world-class renewable electricity grid across the Indo-Pacific region, which will decouple economic growth from global greenhouse gas emissions.”
Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner welcomed the inclusion of large-scale solar generation on the priority project list. “(It) will make the territory a renewable energy superpower,” Gunner said. “Renewable energy from Sun Cable delivered at scale into Darwin will be the catalyst for growth in existing and emerging industries, including low-emissions manufacturing and zero-emissions data centres and digital services.”
The announcement comes just weeks after Sun Cable signed a project development agreement (PDA) with the Northern Territory government. The Australia-ASEAN Power Link has also been afforded Major Project Status by the Australian and Northern Territory governments.
Sun Cable said it will now pursue the next stage of the process with Infrastructure Australia. The Singapore-based company said it is working on a Territory Benefits Plan and predicted that the 70-year project would create about 1,500 jobs during construction and 350 during operations. It said financial close is expected in late 2023, with the first electricity to Darwin by 2026 and Singapore from 2027.
The Sun Cable solar project is one of 44 initiatives included on Infrastructure Australia’s 2021 Infrastructure Priority List. The provision of dispatchable energy storage for firming capacity in the National Electricity Market (NEM) has been included among the High Priority Initiatives. Noting the transition to a new electricity mix in the grid, Infrastructure Australia said the NEM will require significant investments in dispatchable energy storage to support growing renewable energy generation and the future retirement of coal-fired generators.
