Bipyridine and chlorine ligands surround Co and Pt ions, respectively. The heat treatment then causes the bipyridine ligand to thermally decompose into a carbon shell that can protect the growing Co-Pt alloy nanoparticles. “In the nanocatalyst developed by the group, Co and Pt atoms were arranged in a regular way called the ‘intermetallic phase,’ where the unstable Co atoms are stabilized by the surrounding Pt atoms,” the researchers said in “Scalable production of an intermetallic Pt–Co electrocatalyst for high-power proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells,” which was recently published in Energy & Environmental Science. “When nitrogen was effectively doped onto the carbon support, ionomers (proton conductors) were homogeneously dispersed over the entire catalyst layer in the fuel cell, which better facilitated the supply of oxygen gas to the surface of the Co-Pt nanocatalyst.” The team said that the “simple and scalable method” offers enhanced fuel cell power performance with lower platinum use. Compared to state-of-the-art fuel cell catalysts, it “showed almost twice the power performance per platinum use,” said the researchers.
UNSW Sydney researchers have developed an algorithm that produces high-resolution modeled images from lower-resolution micro X-ray computerized tomography (CT) to enhance images of hydrogen Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). They aim to control water flows within fuel cells. “An advancement in water modeling is achieved using X-ray micro-computed tomography, deep learned super-resolution, multi-label segmentation, and direct multi-phase simulation,” said the researchers. The PEMFCs can become inefficient if the water cannot properly flow out of the cell and subsequently “floods” the system. “Until now, it has been very hard for engineers to understand the precise ways in which water drains, or indeed pools, inside the fuel cells due to their very small size and very complex structures,” the team said. They reported that the algorithm improves the field of view by around 100 times compared to the high-res image. The same scanner needs to take the low-res and high-res images. During training and testing, the algorithm achieved 97.3% accuracy when producing high-res modeling from low-res imagery and created a high-resolution model in just one hour. The researchers described their findings in “Large-scale physically accurate modelling of real proton exchange membrane fuel cell with deep learning,” which was recently published in Nature Communications. 
Germany and Belgium have agreed to link their hydrogen networks by 2028. “We want to deepen our dialogue on the production of hydrogen, inside and outside Europe, for trilateral cooperation, and on regulatory work within the European Union,” the countries stated. They said they will jointly examine possible cooperation in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. 
Dutch, German and Australian companies have expressed intentions to participate in TrHyHub, a joint hydrogen hub in Western Australia. “The Port of Rotterdam Authority and Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) confirmed their intention for further partnership,” said the Port of Rotterdam. About 20 companies plan to focus on the development of policy, standards, certifications, technologies, and supply chains. 
Lhyfe has obtained a construction permit for its second green and renewable hydrogen production site in the Morbihan region of Brittany, France. “Lhyfe Bretagne, which should be operational by the second half of 2023, will mainly supply hydrogen for transport in the region and the industrial processes of regional companies,” said the French hydrogen producer. It will begin civil engineering work at the end of February to produce up to 2 tons of green hydrogen per day (5 MW) next to a wind farm. Clients will be within a radius of about 150 km. The company aims to install more than 3 GW of capacity by 2030.
Tevva has performed a range test of a hydrogen-electric prototype truck, driving a total of 1,000 km. “The return journey saw the truck cover almost 350 miles (563 km) alone, without needing a single stop for recharging,” said the UK-based company. “This was made possible by the truck’s hydrogen fuel cell which tops up the range-extended (Rex) vehicle’s lithium battery when needed.”

Large-scale PV projects have been delayed in several Latin American countries due to well-known supply chain issues in the solar manufacturing industry. This has made module and inverter supplies critical in markets with traditionally weak currencies, high-interest rates, and scarce financing.
But as these chain supply issues start to fade, activity in the utility-scale PV segment has resumed in recent months, with several delayed projects now being completed.
Italy's Enel, for example, said this week that it has completed the 375 MW Campos del Sol project in the Antofagasta region of northern Chile. The $320 million facility, developed by its Enel Chile unit, features close to 1 million bifacial solar panels.
Enel originally started construction in August 2019. At the time, it was destined to become the largest solar plant in Chile. The company said completion was scheduled for the end of 2020. 
Enel also said this week that it has started building the 486.7 MW Guayepo I and II solar plant on a piece of land of more than 1,110 hectares in Ponedera and Sabanalarga, in Atlántico department, Colombia. The company said it will use more than 820,600 bifacial 595 W panels for the tracker-based project.
In early February, Enel said it had started working on the 29.87 MW Baco solar plant in Panama. It will be built in the province of Chiriquí, next to the 30.88 MW Madre Vieja solar park and 3 km from the other solar projects that Enel Green Power has in operation in the area.
The new plant will feature more than 50,400 solar panels with capacities of 595 Wp each. It will occupy a maximum area of 32 hectares and will have nearly 470 mounting structures.
Also this week, US-based Verano Energy (formerly Verano Capital) said it had secured an environmental permit for a 100 MW project in Majes, Peru. The investment partner for the project is Yinson Renewables, which is part of Yinson Holding Berhad Group.
In January, the Dominican Republic's National Energy Commission (CNE) signed an agreement with Emerald Solar Energy for 25 MW Canoa II Solar Park. The project will be built in Vicente Noble, Barahona province. The new concession for the Canoa II Solar Park is an amendment to a contract that allowed the company to build the first phase of the power generation project with a capacity of 25 MW. The first part, Canoa I, was completed in 2019.

To achieve this, the company relied on its patented Kavian platform, which was developed to enable commercial-scale production of a wide range of battery technologies, from lithium-ion to lithium metal and all-solid-state batteries.
“The platform can customize the form factor of the battery – whereby the battery itself can become part of product design via customized shapes and sizes,” Karl Littau, chief technology officer at Sakuu, explains.
Sakuu’s patterned battery cells were made with patterned openings for thermal management in a fully dry process. Namely, the achievement of patterned battery printing enables more effective use of battery cell volume with new pathways in thermal dynamic regulation.
This allows integration of fixturing, sensors, and thermal transport pathways, as well as regulation through the patterned design – especially when thin sub-cell battery structures are stacked with identical patterned openings for thermal management in alignment, according to Sakuu.
The company's fully industrialized process for printing batteries using a proprietary multi-material, multi-layer approach in a parallel and dry process stands in opposition to layer-on-layer printing or screen-printing, which are inherently wet processes that require significant energy to remove unwanted solvents and are susceptible to poor printing quality and unreliable production.
Founded in 2016, Sakuu has already achieved important milestones. Last year, it announced the benchmark energy-density achievement of 800 Wh/L in its first-generation non-printed lithium metal battery. In addition, the first-generation lithium-metal battery demonstrated high energy retention at 97% after 200 cycles. Sakuu’s battery, while remaining dendrite-free, is expected to record 80% retention at 800 cycles once cycling has been completed.
Sakuu’s stated goal was to make fully 3D printable solid-state batteries capable of greater than 1200 Wh/L by 2023, substantially surpassing lithium-ion batteries found in today’s top-selling EVs that function in a range of 500–700 Wh/L.
The company's latest achievement is described as first-of-its-kind in battery manufacturing and an important step towards the company’s planned commercial scale production of next-generation SwiftPrint batteries, including solid-state batteries, from its Kavian platform in gigafactories worldwide.
“We believe we have the only known solution for manufacturing solid-state batteries at scale with our novel Kavian platform,” Sakuu Founder and CEO Robert Bagheri said. Sakuu’s Kavian™ platform will be sold to other battery manufacturers as well as to automotive, e-mobility, and aerospace manufacturers.
In addition, Sakuu plans on licensing its own battery chemistries, both Li-metal and solid-state, to be produced with either traditional roll-to-roll manufacturing or in gigafactories using Kavian manufacturing.

Gentari Renewables Australia has completed its purchase of Wirsol Energy and its assets from Germany-based renewables group Wircon.
Wirsol Energy, which entered the Australian market in 2017, owns and operates renewable energy and storage projects across the Australian states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. Its portfolio includes 422 MW of operational solar and storage projects and nearly double that in development.
Gentari’s purchase of the portfolio, understood to have been priced at just under AUD 1 billion ($705 million), marks the company's entry into the Australian renewable energy market. It is also the latest milestone in the path towards Gentari achieving its target of 30 to 40 GW in renewable energy capacity by 2030, increasing its overall renewables portfolio to approximately 1.6 GW of installed capacity in Malaysia, India, the United Arab Emirates, and Australia.
The company said it plans to expand its solar capacity and battery energy storage capabilities, and to position itself as a green hydrogen producer, with Australia as a strategic market to achieve these goals. Gentari Chief Executive Officer Sushil Purohit said the acquisition of Wirsol is a key building block for Gentari in Australia.
“Australia offers strong market potential, underpinned by supportive government policies and a robust financing ecosystem, making the investment into Wirsol Energy a natural choice for Gentari,” he said. “This addition to Gentari’s portfolio will enable us to continue our efforts in building capacity for delivering integrated sustainable energy solutions, to help customers make the journey to net zero emissions.”
Wirsol’s Australian assets include the 90 MW Clermont Solar Farm in Queensland and the 110 MW Wemen Solar Farm in Victoria. Its development pipeline includes the 445 MW Maryvale Solar and Energy Storage project being developed in New South Wales, and has acquired the land rights to develop the 75 MW to 85 MW Barnawartha Solar Farm in Victoria.

Recombination can have a significant impact on electrical performance in perovskite cells, with implications for open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, fill factor, and ultimately, power conversion efficiency.
The researchers used what they call a “physics-based method” to create a film based on a type of LHP known as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). They deposited that directly on a plasmonic substrate made of hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) with a high local density of state, via spin coating. They fabricated the multi-layered HMM with four pairs of alternative 10 nm thick layers made of silver, aluminum sulfate, and ozone (Ag-Al2 O3) by electron beam evaporation.
“The metal layer serves as a mirror, which creates reversed images of electron-hole pairs, weakening the ability of the electrons to recombine with the holes,” the scientists said, noting that they used a momentum-resolved imaging technique to characterize the film's transition dipole orientation, which is the key factor enabling control over exciton recombination processes.
They claim that the interaction between the in–plane dipole of the LHP and its image formed on plasmonic substrate results in a tenfold decrease in the recombination rate, without any chemical treatment, optical cavity, and photonic band–gap engineering.
“Furthermore, image dipole interaction enables us to substantially improve the device performance of photodetectors by achieving more than 250% increase in the photoresponsivity,” they added.
The academics presented their findings in “Gigantic suppression of recombination rate in 3D lead-halide perovskites for enhanced photodetector performance,” which was recently published in Nature Photonics.

“The Tongwei Terra shingled panel adopts Thermal Laser Separation (TLS) technology through which the whole cell is cut into several cell strips and interconnected using conductive adhesive to achieve flexible connection,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “This can optimize the solar panel structure and achieves zero cell spacing, which effectively increases the light-receiving area of the panel.”
Shingled panels feature a busbar-free structure in which only a small proportion of cells are not exposed to sunlight. The cells are bonded to form a shingled high-density string and the resulting strips are connected through a conductive adhesive. The reduced number of busbars reduces shadowing losses.
The monofacial monocrystalline panel is available in six versions with power outputs ranging from 400 W to 430 W and a power conversion efficiency between 20.1% and 21.7%. The open-circuit voltage is between 41.2 V and 41.8 V and the short-circuit current is between 12.41 A and 13.05 A.
The modules measure 1,812 mm x 1,096 mm x 30 mm and weigh in at 20.8 kg. They are fabricated with 3.2 mm tempered glass, an anodized aluminum frame, and a junction box with an IP 68 rating.
The new product can operate with a system voltage of 1,500 V and temperatures ranging between -40 C and 85 C. It features a temperature coefficient of -0.34% per degree Celsius. The manufacturer offers a 25-year product warranty and a 25-year power output guarantee for 84.80% of the initial yield.
“Tongwei Terra meets the needs of European customers in many ways and is popular in the high-end market of Europe,” claimed the Chinese PV manufacturer. “The shingled panels are all designed from the perspective of architecture. With architectural aesthetic characteristics, they fully meet the buildings’ waterproof, windproof, fireproof, wind, and snow-resistant features and provide extra eco-friendly attributes to the buildings.”

They claim it has lower ripple content and better system performance.
Aalborg inverters are devices that were originally created by scientists at Aalborg University in Denmark. They are known to offer several advantages, such as high efficiency, a wide range of input voltages, and minimum voltage drops for the filtering inductors. Their inventors have described them as “Boost in Boost, Buck in Buck” inverters, in reference to the fact that only one power stage works at a high frequency to achieve the minimum switching loss.
The scientists described their findings in “Design of advanced Aalborg inverter for extracting maximum power from renewable energy sources tied with autonomous grid system,” which was recently published in IET Power Electronics. They explained that Aalborg inverters are most suitable for integrating power grid systems with photovoltaics. The devices have a lower number of switches than conventional, voltage-source inverters and can reportedly enhance PV system performance by reducing switching losses.
The proposed inverter design is purely based on the buck converter and boosts converter operation.
“The inverter works on the single-phase inverter topology with DC/AC transformer with fewer operations,” the scientists said. “In this phase, the system's power stage starts to work at a minimum voltage drop across the inductor coil, and frequency at a higher level is attained by enhancing the system's efficiency and reliability.”
The device uses an input LC filter to create the conditions for the ripple present in the DC input source to be always lesser than that of a conventional inverter.
“The total input value of the capacitance starts to decrease with the support of the LC filter,” the academics said. “At higher inputs, the smoothing capacitor will be inserted across the system to support the energy balance at the system for a double line higher frequency.”
The research team includes scientists from India's Kumarasamy College of Engineering, the Islamic Azad University in Iran, the University of Santiago in Chile, and China's Harbin Institute of Technology.
“The effectiveness of the inverter can be analyzed by testing the Aalborg inverter with various irradiance levels of the solar photovoltaic array,” the scientists concluded.

In a joint statement, the two companies said they reached a patent licensing and transfer agreement over their intellectual property.
“The agreement allows both parties to use each other’s solar patents and respectively drop all pending cases between the two companies,” they said. “To meet the needs of customers, each company will continue to offer and support their respective products in various markets.”
Trina Solar said in a patent infringement lawsuit against Hanwha Qcells (Qidong), a Chinese unit of  Hanwha Qcells, that the South Korean company had unlawfully exported and sold solar modules that infringed upon a patent granted to the Chinese manufacturer by the China National Intellectual Property Administration in 2016.
“The lawsuit involves the core cell technology commonly used in Hanwha's current modules produced in China and sold globally,” a Trina Solar spokesperson told pv magazine at the time. “The alleged infringing products include Q.PEAK DUO BLK M-G11A+, Q.PEAK DUO M-G11 and other key products.”
If Trina Solar had succeeded in proving its claims in China, Hanwha Qcells could have been prohibited from producing and selling the infringing products in China and other countries. It may have also faced high infringement compensation costs for past production and sales.
The latest edition of pv magazine is devoted entirely to energy storage, with topics ranging from how battery suppliers can avoid supply-chain related policy risks, to the plans Russia hatched to be a hydrogen superpower – before it invaded Ukraine.
In December, a German court issued a preliminary injunction that ordered Trina Solar to stop selling its Honey and Vertex X solar modules in Germany, as they allegedly infringed upon the patented passivation technologies of Hanwha Qcells.
In late October, Hanwha Solutions filed a preliminary injunction request in which it claimed that Trina Solar (Germany) had been improperly selling solar modules in the German market. It said that the Trina Solar panels infringed upon one of its own patents for its proprietary Q.ANTUM passivation technology. It said the technology plays a key role in improving the performance of silicon-based solar cells.

Ongoing supply chain disruptions, shifting renewable energy procurement goals, and a global energy crisis took hold in 2022. This year, some of these trends are evolving to a new stage in the energy transition, says S&P Global.
After two years of feeling the effects of tightened supply chains, raw materials and shipping costs are declining in 2023. Global shipping costs have lowered to pre-pandemic levels. However, S&P Global says this cost relief won’t immediately translate to lower coverall capital expenditures for renewable energy projects. 
S&P Global says land access and grid connections are proving to be the biggest bottleneck for the industry. This is leading to an unintended consequence of driving up development costs, as investors rush to deploy capital in markets where interconnection availability is insufficient, and investors are willing to pay premiums for faster, construction-ready projects. 
Another change pushing prices upward is the shortage of skilled workers, causing a rise in construction labor costs. This, along with a rising cost of capital, will likely prevent any noticeable price declines in project capex in the near term, says S&P Global. 
PV module prices have fallen faster than expected in early 2023, as polysilicon supply becomes more abundant. This relief will likely trickle down to module prices, though it is expected to be offset by manufacturers looking to recover margins. 
Further down the value chain, installers and distributors are expected to increase their margins. S&P says this will likely lead to less cost relief benefits to rooftop solar end-users, while utility-scale developers will benefit from lowered costs more. S&P projects utility-scale demand to intensify globally, particularly in cost-sensitive emerging markets. 
In 2022, distributed solar consolidated its position as a mainstream electricity supply option in many established markets. In 2023, S&P Global expects the technology to spread to new consumer segments and gain ground in new markets. New types of households and small businesses will gain access as shared solar options become available, and PV systems are expected to increasingly be attached with energy storage. 
Among households, upfront cash payments remain the most common investment option, though electricity distributors continue to push for a more diversified landscape that includes rental, lease, and power purchase agreement contracts. These financing models are expected to spread beyond the United States, where they have been deployed extensively over the past decade. 
As liquidity becomes a major concern for many businesses, commercial and industrial customers are expected to increasingly adopt third-party financing as well. For the providers of third-party financed PV systems, the challenge is to secure contracts with credit-worthy offtakers, says S&P Global. 
The overall policy landscape is expected to favor more distributed generation, either through cash grants, value-added tax reductions, tax rebates, or feed-in tariffs. 
Supply chain challenges and national security concerns have led to an increased focus on local manufacturing of solar and energy storage, particularly in the United States and Europe. An emphasis on reducing reliance on imported gas has caused renewable energy to become the center of energy supply strategies. 
New policy like the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and REPowerEU in Europe are drawing in large investment in new manufacturing capacity. It will also lead to a boost in deployment. S&P Global expects a 2023 global buildout of close to 500 GW of wind, solar, and battery energy storage, over 20% more than the amount installed in 2022. 
“However, concerns persist over Chinese dominance of the manufacturing of the equipment – particularly for solar and batteries – and the various risks involved in being over-dependent on a single region to supply the required goods,” says S&P Global.

The Dutch government will ban the sale of standalone central heating boilers from 2026, with all households required to install hybrid heat pumps using the heat from boilers as a secondary heat source. In 2022, the Hybrid Heat Pump Action Plan resulted in a 130% surge in sales for such heat pump technologies.
The number of installed air-water heat pumps increased by 100% to 73,000 in 2022. Of these, at least 23,000 were hybrid models, according to the DHPA.
“The fact that the growth rate of hybrid heat pumps is probably even higher than the number measured is because models of air-water heat pumps have also been installed that can run as both all-electric and hybrid, but are not registered as hybrid,” said DHPA Chairman Frank Agterberg.
To accompany the technology’s growth, “the sector is investing heavily in production lines, import capacity, and stocks,” says Agterberg. “At the same time, we are working with Techniek Nederland on the installation capacity. For example, we are setting up a national training program with suppliers and installers,” he added.
Last year’s remarkable growth in the Dutch residential heat pump market was mostly concentrated in wealthy households. “Making the less wealthy households gas-free is now the challenge,” said Agterberg.
This year, the association also wants to focus on expanding the photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) heat pump market.
“We do not yet have concrete figures for this [source], but you can notice that it is growing rapidly,” Agterberg said.
