Hong Kong-based green hydrogen company InterContinental Energy, the CWP Global renewables company owned by Luxembourg-registered venture capital group PostScriptum Ventures, and the Mirning Green Energy organization associated with the Mirning indigenous people whose ancestral lands stretched into western and southern Australia, have unveiled plans for a Western Green Energy Hub.
The AU$100 billion (US$74.7 billion), 15,000km2 project could reach 50 GW of solar and wind power generation capacity to produce 3.5 million tons of green hydrogen or 20 million tons of green ammonia annually.
In a press release about the plans issued today, project chair Brendan Hammond said: “The Western Green Energy Hub is historic on two fronts. First, the scale at which we will be able to deliver green fuels to markets and customers around the world, helping to move us all towards a net-zero future. Second, and possibly more importantly, the way in which we are working with the Mirning People, the original owners of the land, to create a truly long-term and sustainable, multi-generational partnership.”
Anglo-Dutch energy company Shell has signed a memorandum of understanding to explore using gas from the Nyhamna processing plant in Aukra, on the Norwegian Sea, to generate ‘blue hydrogen‘ – powered by gas and featuring carbon capture and storage tech – at the planned Aukra Hydrogen Hub. Shell signed the agreement with the Aker Clean Hydrogen unit of Norway's Aker Group fishing, construction and engineering business and with Bergen-based energy infrastructure company CapeOmega, partners in the Aukra hydrogen project.
“Together we have got what it takes to develop, build and operate the Aukra Hydrogen Hub safely and cost-efficiently,” said Aker Clean Hydrogen CEO Knut Nyborg yesterday. Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field on the Norwegian continental shelf and is technical service provider at the Nyhamna gas plant. The company is also a partner in the Northern Lights CO2 storage joint venture being driven by Norwegian state-owned energy company Equinor.
That deal was announced after Italian state-backed research body the Agenzia nazionale per le nuove tecnologie, l'energia e lo sviluppo economico sostenibile (ENEA) and Shell Energy Italia last week signed a three-year agreement to work together to develop hydrogen technologies with a focus on decarbonizing energy-intensive industries, including “steel, cement, glass, ceramics, paper and aluminum,” according to a press release issued to announce the development. The partnership will also examine hydrogen storage and how Italy's well-developed gas infrastructure can be harnessed for hydrogen.
Shell Energy Italia president Massimiliano Mannino, quoted in the note, said: “We are convinced that thanks to ENEA's many years of experience and our knowledge of the market … we can concretely launch innovative and sustainable solutions for the energy transition as well as promote a structural change in final energy consumption.”
Siemens has begun construction of the 8.75 MW Wunsiedel green hydrogen plant in northeast Bavaria which aims to produce up to 1,350 tons of the fuel per year. Featuring an electrolyzer supplied by the Bavarian brand, the facility is being developed to feed hydrogen demand in the German regions of Upper Franconia, Upper Palatinate, Thuringia and Saxony, as well as Western Bohemia in Czechia.
A statement about the project, issued on Friday, said: “The plant will be constructed at Wunsiedel Energy Park and connected to the existing Siemens battery storage facility and adjacent industrial enterprises. These can use waste heat or the oxygen split off during electrolysis. This connected infrastructure will serve as a model for the whole of Germany.”
Helsinki-based municipal energy company Keravan Energia and compatriot energy tech business Q Power are starting a power-to-methane pilot plant as part of a plan to construct the first full-scale methanation plant in Finland.
“The fuel will be produced from carbon dioxide captured from [a] bioenergy plant smokestack and clean hydrogen,” said the project partners in a note yesterday. Keravan and Q Power conducted a pre-feasibility study this year to determine the project's potential and will work towards a 4-10 MW installation. “The production of synthetic methane will be commenced in September 2021 in a small-scale pilot, designed to validate the methanation process with the specific flue gas composition,” added the statement. “In tandem with the pilot, a feasibility study will be started … The goal is to start the commercial production of synthetic methane in 2024.”
New York State-based fuel cell vehicle company Hyzon Motors has signed a memorandum (MoU) of understanding with French energy giant TotalEnergies to intensify cooperation to develop hydrogen refueling and vehicle supply solutions for long-haul transport in Europe.
“This MoU strengthens the existing commercial relationship between one of the world's largest energy companies and a leading supplier of hydrogen commercial vehicles,” read a note released yesterday. TotalEnergies made a direct investment in Hyzon last year to support the U.S. company's manufacturing and engineering centers in the United States, Europe and China. Under a second agreement, the companies will aim to produce 80 hydrogen fuel cell-powered trucks for TotalEnergies' French customers by 2023.
Global chief executive grouping The Hydrogen Council yesterday announced 14 new members to take it to 123 representatives of utilities, chemical producers, energy companies, engineers, mobility providers and bankers. The organization said, in a press release yesterday: “The Hydrogen Council now includes four new steering members: Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), Honeywell, Sasol, and Wood; eight new supporting members: Cellcentric, Howden, Indian Oil Corporation, John Cockerill, Komatsu, MAN Energy Solutions, Parker Hannifin Corporation, and TÜV SÜD; and two new investors: Barclays and FiveT Hydrogen.” reads a note released on Monday. The group also announced Tom Linebarger, CEO of U.S. energy engineer Cummins, will take over as co-chair from Toyota chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, to sit alongside Benoît Potier, chief of French industrial gas supplier Air Liquide.
A cross-party group of MPs has called on the U.K. to back the HyNet North West project to produce clean hydrogen for industry, transport and homes and to drive the energy transition in the North West of England and North Wales. The facility, which is also intended to capture carbon emissions from industry, is aiming to be starting operation in 2025. A statement issued by the parliamentarians on Friday said: “Justin Madders, Labour MP for Ellesmere Port, and Andy Carter, Conservative MP for Warrington South, have joined HyNet North West as co-chairs of the cross-party coalition group that is urging the government to select HyNet in the first phase of approvals and avoid delays that could hit businesses across the region.”

Polysilicon maker and inverter company TBEA has said the soaring polysilicon price driven by shortages of the solar panel raw material this year will lift its first-half profits to more than treble the amount booked in January-to-June last year, with the company expecting RMB3-3.2 billion (US$463-494 million). While TBEA also credited income from its solar and wind power plants, polysilicon is the main driver in the profits leap, with the company's Hong Kong-listed subsidiary Xinte Energy predicting its profits will rise from RMB1.74 million (US$269,000) in January-to-June last year to RMB1.15 billion (US$178 million) this time around.
Manufacturer Trina Solar has secured permission from the China Securities Regulatory Commission to issue convertible bonds worth up to RMB5.25 billion (US$811 million), with the proceeds to be spent expanding its production capacity of 210mm-wafer-based solar cells and modules.
PV developer and manufacturer Canadian Solar has secured the tender for a 45 MW/45 MWh energy storage facility in Barranquilla, northern Colombia, with the plant expected to enter operation by June 2023. The tender was held by the Ministry of Energy and Mines of Colombia and Canadian Solar secured 15 years of contracted income from the facility.
Hong Kong-listed renewables investor Kongsun Holding announced plans at the weekend to sell seven solar farms, with a total generation capacity of 209 MW, to state-owned entity China Xinhua Power Development Co Ltd for RMB1.29 billion. The deal will book a net loss of RMB346 million (US$53.4 million) for Kongsun but will reduce its liabilities and enable it to pay down debt. The transaction will leave the project developer with a 620 MW solar portfolio.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/13/bringing-the-noise-for-better-solar-cell-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,UNITED STATES,UTAH,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JULY 13, 2021",Bringing the noise for better solar cell efficiency,"As today’s silicon solar cells move closer to their theoretical efficiency limit, and the manufacturing industry continues to scale up, even tiny increases in efficiency can add up. And as the industry begins to look to new technologies that promise even higher efficiencies from complex structures, gaining a deeper understanding of the processes at work within the material will always be of value when it comes to improving their performance.
This was on the minds of scientists led by the University of Utah (UU) in the United States, as they sought to measure tiny fluctuations in electrical current as solar cells and pinpoint the sources of electrical noise, accompanying likely efficiency loss, within a silicon solar cell. Many other studies delving into solar cell materials at this level have relied on microscope imaging techniques to observe the processes at work within the cell. However, in this research the group took a different approach, using a technique called cross-correlation noise spectroscopy to pinpoint sources of electrical noise as a charge is generated through the various cell layers.
“Measuring noise on an object is relatively simple. You can just buy devices that do it. But the problem that plagues us is that these devices also have noise,” explained UU associate instructor of physics Kevin Davenport. “This cross-correlation technique allows us to not only measure the noise of the device, but to also measure the noise of our detector and remove it so that we can see much, much smaller noise signals.”
The technique is described in full in the paper Silicon heterojunction solar cells explored via noise spectroscopy: spatial selectivity and the influence of a-Si passivating layers, published in Applied Physics. The group applied its technique to silicon heterojunction cells, and was able to identify several key areas within the cell where noise was generated and further research could lead to better efficiencies.
“We see this wide spectrum of different noise signals and different positions along the frequency axis. We can say, ‘OK, this part of the note that we see, we can attribute to this physical process and this part is a different physical process,’” said Davenport. “But the device is full of these processes that all generate noise and it’s really difficult to un-entangle them—like pulling out a single voice in a 200-person chorus. This technique allows us to remove a lot of the unwanted portion of the signal.”
One key area they identified was the interface between the silicon layer and the transparent electrode, where deposition of the indium-tin-oxide electrode layer somehow modifies the silicon beneath and creates efficiency-reducing defects. A similar noise signal was detected at the interface with the hole transport layer at the rear of the device.
With the ability to monitor the devices and detect sources of noise at this level, the group hopes its work will open up pathways for further research understanding and mitigating their effects on device performance.

The solution is a combination of the company's three-phase hybrid inverter and a battery with a modular configuration. Between three and eight battery modules could be combined to form a storage system with a capacity of between 9.6 and 25.6 kWh.
According to Sungrow, each battery module weighs 33kg and no cabling is required between the individual modules. The product comes with a 10-year guarantee. It relates to the entire system, including both the hybrid inverter and battery.
The manufacturer said the new solution is designed to optimize solar self-consumption. The system features a maximum discharge current of 30 A, load control for emergency power, and a switchover that can be activated in less than 20 milliseconds.
The home memory is updated and the data checked in real-time via a new “WiNet-S” communication module, which is part of the delivery package, Sungrow specified.
The company, initially, did not provide any information on the price or the start of deliveries of the new home storage system in Europe.

The company said that result, which improves the device efficiency by o.03% compared to the last measurement, taken in June, was confirmed by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin, in Germany.
“Huasu has successfully equaled the world record for the efficiency of HJT solar cells recently,” the manufacturer's CTO, Wang Wenjing, stated. “But under the same efficiency, the area of Huasun’s cells is larger, which is one of the mainstream sizes in the market.” According to him, the champion cell is second only to the HJT cell developed by Japanese chemical company Kaneka in 2017. That 180cm² crystalline silicon device, which featured heterojunction and back-contact technology, achieved 26.63% efficiency.
“The most difficult issue of HJT solar cells is that it is hard to increase the current,” Wang further explained. “This time we increased the current but at the same time, the open-circuit voltage is still high, which finds a new way to improve the efficiency of HJT solar cells in the future.”
The cell exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 745 mV and a fill factor of 0.8454.
Huasun is currently operating a 500 MW module factory in Xuancheng City, in the southeast of China's Anhui province. Most of the production equipment was provided by China-based suppliers, such as Maxwell and Zonchow.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/07/13/india-could-install-8-5-gw-of-solar-in-fiscal-2022/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 13, 2021",India could install 8.5 GW of solar in fiscal 2022,"From pv magazine India
India is set to see a surge in solar installations in fiscal 2022 and will likely add up to 8.5 GW of PV capacity in the fiscal year, according to ratings agency ICRA.  
ICRA expects an aggregate 10.5 GW to 11 GW of fresh renewables capacity in fiscal 2022, with solar accounting for 8.5 GW, wind about 2 GW, and the rest coming from small hydro, biomass, and other sources. This compares to just 7.4 GW of new renewables (including about 5.5 GW solar and 1.5 GW wind) in fiscal 2021.
The installation recovery in fiscal 2022 will be led by a strong project pipeline of 38 GW (including about 9 GW wind). More than 20 GW 0f renewables projects are now in the tendering phase from various nodal agencies, providing visibility for capacity additions over the medium term, said ICRA. 
“The RE sector is expected to witness investments of INR 3.5 trillion over the next four years, increasing the share of RE capacity to 34% of the overall installed capacity by March 2025 from 25% as of March 2021 led by the solar power segment,” said Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president and co-group head of corporate ratings at ICRA. 
Delays in signing power purchase agreements and bid cancellations in expectation of reduced tariff rates remain key challenges for the renewables sector. 
However, Kadam sees PPA activity for the earlier tenders to pick up, as solar bid tariffs are expected to rise in upcoming auctions. This will be in line the rise in module prices and the imposition of basic customs duty (BCD) on imported solar cells and modules from April 2022.  That said, solar power tariffs are expected to remain below INR 3/kWh.
ICRA expects the demand outlook for domestic solar manufacturers to remain favorable. Strong policy support through BCD imposition on solar imports, the notification of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, and a strong order pipeline of about 35 GW to 40 GW over the next three to five years under various schemes mandating the use of domestic modules are factors working in favor of domestic manufacturers. Delays in including overseas suppliers on the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) will further support demand for domestic module makers in the near term. 
“The policy push for the promotion of domestic module manufacturing is expected to improve the cost competitiveness of domestic OEMs and has led to new capacity announcements of more than 15 GW by various OEMs,” said Vikram V, vice president and sector head of corporate ratings at ICRA. “The timely commissioning of these new capacities remains important to meet the growing demand from the developers, given the current capacity constraints. Moreover, the ability of the OEMs to achieve backward integration and build economies of scale would be important to remain competitive against the overseas suppliers on a sustained basis.”

Presented in the paper Efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells with very high fill factors via incorporation of star-shaped polymer, recently published in ScienceAdvances, the cell has a “p-i-n” layout and is based on a perovskite material known as CsMAFA modified with a polymer called polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane-poly(trifluoroethyl methacrylate)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) or, more generally, PPP polymer.
“On the PPP polymer branches, there are multiple chemical anchor sites including carbonyl (C═O) and CF3, which act as 3D skeleton templates to passivate defects at the grain boundaries (GBs) and interfacial surfaces, inhibit nonradiative recombination and charge-transport loss, and improve stabilities under moisture, thermal, and illumination stress,” the Chinese-Swiss group explained. CF3 is a donor material that is commonly used to improve the performance of organic solar cells.
The PPP-modified perovskite is described as a densely packed, high-quality film with an average grain size of 350nm, which compares to 260nm of the same perovskite without the new polymer. It also showed improved steady-state photoluminescence (SSPL), which the academics attributed to the PPP molecules that can mitigate the trap density and passivate grain boundaries and surface defects. The PPP polymer was also found to reduce nonradiative recombination, charge-transport losses, and ion migration.
The solar cell achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 22.1% and a fill factor of 0.862, which the research group defined as astoundingly high. “Surface recombination is likely to be the dominant recombination mechanism in the PPP-modified device,” the researchers explained. “Thus, it appears feasible to further boost the fill factor close to its Shockley Queisser limit of 0.904 by passivating defects in interfaces.”
An encapsulated version of the device also showed good operational stability with almost no change in efficiency after 1,000 hours of maximum power point tracking under one-sun illumination at 45 degrees Celsius.

“These novel shapes can be widely used in domestic areas (streets and solar farms) without the requirement of tracking systems,” the scientists explained. “On the other hand, these towers have a lateral area which has been covered with a solar panel and equals … twice the infrastructure area, which is very suitable for urban areas.” They specified that similar panels may be particularly suitable for regions near the equator where relatively homogeneous sunlight may hit all lateral surfaces of the panels' vertical structure.
The three panel typologies were all conceived with a cooling system based on forced airflow circulation. Under the proposed configuration, the air enters into the modules from the trapdoor at their bottom side and the heat flux exits from another trapdoor placed at the top of each shape.
The performance of the panels was analyzed through open-source CFD software, which is computational fluid dynamics simulation software that engineers and analysts use to intelligently predict how liquids and gases will perform. “To simulate different hours of a day, three different amounts of heat flux were applied on the lateral surface of each panel,” the group specified. “The solar panels were cooled at … constant heat flux, via air, with three mass flow rates.” The inlet air temperature was assumed to be constant, at 20 degrees Celsius.
Among the three shapes, the conical solar panels achieved the minimum back-side temperature. “The maximum temperature difference between the proposed shapes was between the conical-shaped and pyramid-shaped solar panels, and the difference was approximately 10.9 degrees Celsius,” the academics emphasized. “The maximum temperature difference was observed for the case with a heat flux and air mass flow rate of 750 W/m2 and 0.24kg, respectively.”
The superior thermal performance of the conical panels was explained by the research group with the fact that the heat transfer coefficient depends on the flow characteristics and geometrical properties of the surface, and that their flow streamlines create the conditions for better air circulation. “The streamlines get denser form in this shape and [that] causes … more increment in the turbulence intensity of the flow,” it further explained. “The maximum temperature of the conical shaped solar panel is less than those of the other two structures for all the cases with varying heat fluxes and mass flow rates.”
Furthermore, the scientists ascertained that the conical panels showed 8.4% and 5% higher efficiency than the pyramid-shaped and hexagon-shaped modules, and that the former also achieved a higher power output.
The findings of the research were presented in the study Thermal, efficiency and power output evaluation of pyramid, hexagonal and conical forms as solar panel, published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering. The research group includes scientists from King Khalid University and Yanbu Industrial College, in Saudi Arabia; GLA University, in India; Ton Duc Thang University, in Vietnam; the American University of the Middle East, in Kuwait; and Çankaya University, in Turkey.

The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) decreased 2.5%, while the S&P 500 increased by 1.1% and the DJIA decreased by 1.8%. The top five performing solar stocks in the US all saw gains: Sunnova Energy International, Inc. (23.4%), Generac Holdings, Inc. (23.3%), Enphase Energy (20.0%), Sunrun, Inc. (18.9%), and SunPower Corp. (10.0%). The index performed marginally better relative to the past couple months (April – 8.7% decline and May 6.4% decline).
The industry still faces many challenges: Rising equipment costs, supply and labor shortages, and constraints on the supply of Chinese polysilicon products. But demand remains strong and is expected to continue through H2 2021, provided federal and solar tax credits persist. Installation companies are experiencing 30-35% YoY growth; but as an unnamed industry executive puts it, “the question is how much can be delivered given the industry wide supply chain and labor challenges.”
Prices for racking and modules have increased ~8%. The residential market is expected to feel less impact given its higher margins compared to utility scale; the total price change may only be $0.05/W. Contractors may have greater ability to absorb increases in supply costs.
Polysilicon prices are expected to increase to around CNY 225/kg (US$35) in Q3 before coming back down to CNY 175/kg (US$27) at year’s end due to the slow purchase volume from module manufacturers in H1 2021.
On June 10th, US Congress requested immediate action from customs after detailed allegations of prevalent forced labor in Xinjiang, where around 50% of the world’s polysilicon production is located.
The Biden administration has now ordered a ban on polysilicon imports from Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. and three other Chinese companies in Xinjiang, a move that may impact the US solar industry and undermine the White House’s aggressive climate change goals.

China currently leads the race in Li-ion cell manufacturing, accounting for around 70% of total production worldwide. At the same time, Europe accounts for a mere 8% of annual global production capacity, at 62 GWh.
Europe has outlined a clear strategy to become less dependent on importing cells from Asia with the creation of the European Battery Alliance, positioning itself as an emerging competitive market globally for the coming years. Its core objectives are ensuring that industries are financially aided throughout the value chain; research, innovation and training; and the creation of a “battery passport” to prioritize domestic manufacturing as a key point to start a circular economy around EU-made Li-ion cells. To this end, it created the Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) Fund, supporting seven member states with €3.2 billion in activities, from mining for raw materials to recycling used battery units.

Big plans
European Li-ion cell production capacity should increase tenfold by 2025, with 25 gigafactories planned for that year, and a further five already announced for 2030. This translates into a total annual production capacity of around 591 GWh already in 2025.
We have identified six gigafactories currently operational in the EU, equivalent to a total production capacity of Li-ion cells of 62 GWh. By 2025, this is expected to increase to 25 plants and a production capacity of around 591 GWh, and reaching 664 GWh by 2030.
This capacity is likely to increase further, as some projects have announced their installed capacities, but not yet their commissioning dates. These are estimated to add a further 120 GWh of manufacturing capacity by 2030, placing the total at 784 GWh.
Germany has both the highest number of planned gigafactory plants by 2030 (nine projects) and a planned capacity almost three times larger than Hungary, the next largest. Tesla, Northvolt and LG Chem are expected to grasp 32% of the total share of European Li-ion cell capacity by 2030, with further potential for Northvolt involvement in future projects for Skoda.
Stationary storage
Li-ion cell production from European gigafactories is estimated to be heavily weighted to the EV market, although this varies by state.
The milestone of 30 million EVs on the road by 2030 is a huge leap from the present 1.8 million electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Considering that an average EV battery pack is currently around 60.7 kWh, the total capacity necessary for these new vehicles would be at least 1,700 GWh.
Therefore, there is a clear drive to ramp-up local production capacity of Li-ion cells in order to meet that future demand. The cumulative output for the EV industry will be just under 4,500 GWh by 2030. By contrast, stationary storage applications will represent a much lower market share, despite substantial growth during this decade.
From 2023, the focus of Li-ion cell production for the automotive sector starts to decrease, stabilizing at around 90% of total capacity. The FREYR and Northvolt gigafactories in the Nordics are expected to provide the bulk of the capacity for stationary storage. Gigafactories planned in other countries will predominantly supply Li-ion cells to automotive manufacturers.
Continental market
Even though Europe will see a tenfold increase in its Li-ion cell production capacity in just four years, project funding will be largely dependent on securing long-term supply deals for cells.
Car manufacturers are securing supply through long-term contracts with cell manufacturers. These agreements translate into the bulk of the required funding for gigafactories. There are three strategies used by the majority of EV automakers to ensure their long-term production targets can be met.
The latter two options enable developers to secure the bulk of the funding necessary to construct and commission a gigafactory. Additional capacity can then be allocated to the production of cells for stationary storage applications, leaving an even smaller margin free for shorter-term contracts.
Cost reductions
While 90% of cell production capacity from EU gigafactories will supply the automotive industry by 2030, the market for stationary storage is also growing. Increasing levels of renewables, improved local resilience and grid independence, and enhanced savings from dynamic retail tariffs are the main factors driving the near sixfold increase of production capacity for stationary storage by that year.
With the scale of this increase in supply, it is expected that cell and battery costs will keep falling to 2030, with the automotive industry being the main driver. Cell costs are expected to record a further 27% drop by 2030, from the 2023 estimates. Contributing to this decrease are reductions in shipping expenses and material costs from enhancing the cell’s efficiency levels and adopting lower cost compositions.
Our European Market Monitor on Energy Storage forecasts that stationary battery storage will reach nearly 30 GWh of cumulative installed capacity by 2025. On the other hand, the total annual European production capacity not yet committed for EVs will exceed 60 GWh by the same year.
Although the industry will be competing against further growth in EV take-up for this capacity, the potential supply of Li-ion cells for stationary applications is projected to be 10 times the market demand in 2025.

Not in Singapore, though. The city-state – which is already home to the world’s largest offshore floating PV (OFPV) farm, as well as the world’s largest FPV testbed at the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) – is now home to an operational 60 MW FPV array on the Tengeh Reservoir.
Sembcorp Floating Solar Singapore, a unit of Sembcorp Industries, began construction on the system back in June 2020. Now the system’s 122,000 Trina Solar 210 Vertex dual-glass modules, which cover a surface area the size of 45 football fields, are in full commercial operation and delivering green energy from Singapore’s main reservoir of drinking water via a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Public Utilities Board, Singapore’s National Water Agency. The PPA will see approximately 7% of its energy demand provided by the FPV array. 
At the Virtual Leaders Summit on Climate in April, convened by US President Joe Biden, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that in order for Singapore “to overcome (its) small size and lack of resources, and achieve (its) emission reduction goals, Singapore must also innovate and use technology extensively.” But Singapore is certainly not all talk – it can walk the walk, and more than that, it is doing its walking on water. 
The system will generate 77,259,302 kWh of clean electricity per year, which is enough to power 16,000 average Singaporean households. 
“The application of Trina Solar’s 210 Vertex modules in Singapore’s floating project has been a successful showcase,” said Zhao Lei, Trina Solar’s project leader in the China region. “After the Singapore project, more and more country markets show confidence and recognition of the quality of Trina Solar’s 210 Vertex modules. Our brand has earned its wider reputation overseas.” 
The Public Utilities Board said in an earlier statement that it was seeking double-glass PV modules like those supplied by Trina Solar, because they needed to be durable enough to perform in wet and humid conditions for 25 years. The panels themselves are supported by high-density polyethylene (HDPE) floats. The floats are UV-resistant, which is a necessity to protect them from degradation. 
Singapore installed its first FPV system as a 1 MWp testbed on the Tengeh Reservoir in 2016. Now that this large-scale FPV is now successfully in operation, Singapore will look to repeat the process across its many reservoirs and other bodies of water.

CWP Global and InterContinental Energy, two of the main proponents behind the recently rejected Asia Renewable Energy Hub, have announced a proposal for a new, even more ambitious project in the Goldfields–Esperance region, in the southeastern part of Western Australia. 
The proposed Western Green Energy Hub plan is designed to scale to a massive 50 GW of solar and wind. The electricity would be used to produce millions of tons of green hydrogen or its derivative, green ammonia. Project costs have been estimated at AUD 100 billion ($74.9 billion), with the infrastructure to be built across 15,000 square kilometers in the Shire of Dundas and the city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder.
Western Australian Minister for Hydrogen Industry Alannah MacTiernan said she “welcomed the announcement” and confirmed that the project’s proponents have secured a licence to collect data in support of feasibility studies. The proposal comes less than a month after Australia’s federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, rejected environmental approvals for the 26 GW Asia Renewable Energy Hub, which was proposed by a consortium that included CWP Global and InterContinental Energy. When it was revealed in June, Ley’s decision triggered controversy, but the consortium has said it will work to amend its plans so the project can still go ahead.
The chairman of the Western Green Energy Hub’s (WGEH) board, Brendan Hammond, has described the project as “historic” in terms of its scale and its partnership with First Nations Land Owners. According to the project group’s statement, Mirning Green Energy Ltd. – a wholly owned subsidiary of Mirning Traditional Lands Aboriginal Corp. – will have a “meaningful carried equity stake” in the project and a permanent seat on the project’s consortium board.
The project has been proposed for the state's Goldfields-Esperance region. “The region provides an optimal diurnal profile for renewable energy, with consistently high levels of wind and solar energy over a 24-hour period,” the group said.
The consortium plans to build the project in phases, eventually scaling up to produce 3.5 million tons of zero-carbon green hydrogen or 20 million tons of green ammonia per year, for domestic use and for export.
“Green fuels produced at the site will meet massive future demand from multiple sectors, including in co-firing in power generation, the shipping sector, heavy industry such as steel, chemicals and mining, as well as the aviation sector,” the group added.
MacTiernan said the proposed Western Green Energy Hub would be one of the world’s largest renewable energy projects. “Importantly, this project is a powerful collaboration between the Mirning traditional owners and industry, and would be a transformational opportunity for the community,” she said.
MacTiernan has previously said that the state government wants to have 200 GW of renewables to produce green hydrogen by 2040.

German inverter manufacturer SMA will pair its Sunny Design tool with mounting-system specialist Renusol's PV-Configurator 3.0 platform via a new interface to make work processes for installers more efficient.
They said layout changes will be more easily implemented. Multiple data entries will no longer he necessary with the new interface.
PV-Configurator 3.0 allows PV system planners to create complete project reports to plan solar systems with all components. More than 100,000 PV modules are recorded in a database according to size, frame thickness, performance data, and the associated datasheets for each product.
Via the new interface, the system parameters can be automatically transferred to the Sunny Design configuration tool and transmission errors are excluded, the two companies said.
All location-related aspects, such as voltage and legal framework conditions, are already recorded in the software. According to the underlying data, suitable solar inverters can be selected for the planned designs. Sunny Design also supports installers in determining the optimal cable dimensions and selecting the most suitable battery storage systems.
“By networking the two tools, planning solar systems is now even easier and more convenient for skilled installers,” said Thomas Straub, senior product manager for Sunny Design at SMA.
