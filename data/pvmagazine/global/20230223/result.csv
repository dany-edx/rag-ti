It aims to develop a 50 MW project in Rangunia, a 20 MW array on a pond at a coal mine in Dinajpur district, and a 7.6 MW installation in Rangamati district, in southeastern Bangladesh.
The state agency published advertisements on Feb. 16 announcing that it is seeking international partners for the construction of the power plants, which will be financed from “cash foreign exchange under power sector development fund of BPDB.” The agency wants to commission the grid-tied plants within 12 months of signing contracts. The government will provide land for the plants.
According to BPDB officials, the 20 MW solar power plant will be set up in a polluted zone, on a pond that was created after extracting coal for years. The pond, according to a recently conducted feasibility study, has the capacity to host a floating solar power plant with 40 MW to 50 MW of capacity.
The 7.6 MW solar power plant will be set up on a plot of land near the 230 MW Karnafuli hydropower station, about 50 kilometers from the port city of Chattogram. The BPDB said it wants to build the new power plant near another 7.4 MW PV array that went online in 2019.
Bangladesh currently has the capacity to generate 958 MW of power from renewable sources, including 724 MW from solar.

The US Department of Energy’s Grid Deployment Office released a request for information (RFI) this week to gather feedback from stakeholders in Puerto Rico on how to allocate $1 billion managed through the Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund (PR-ERF).
After recent hurricanes and decades of underinvestment in the island’s electric grid, the new funds will be developed to increase energy resilience and reduce the energy burden on the Caribbean island’s vulnerable residents. The investment is also aligned with Puerto Rico’s public energy policy to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2050, as well as the US government's commitment to improving the island’s energy system.
After Hurricane Fiona in October 2022, President Joe Biden visited the island and committed to leveraging the technical support of federal agencies to support improvements to Puerto Rico’s electric grid. In December, Biden signed the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act into law, which includes $1 billion for the PR-ERF funding to drive key investments in renewable and resilient energy infrastructure in Puerto Rico.
The PR-ERF package will be managed by the Grid Deployment Office, in consultation with the Federal Energy Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The agency is requesting information from Puerto Rican stakeholders about short- and long-term energy solutions, including residential rooftop solar deployment, community and critical service energy resilience, non-profit partnerships, and workforce training to sustain the island’s clean energy economy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/23/airport-in-tokyo-to-host-180-mw-of-solar/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 23, 2023",Japanese airport to host 180 MW of solar,"Tokyo Gas has revealed that it plans to build a 180 MW solar plant at Tokyo's Narita International Airport in Japan's Chiba prefecture.
The Japanese gas supplier will take a 50% stake in Green Energy Frontier, the special purpose vehicle that has been created for the project. Narita International Airport Corp. (NAA) will hold the remaining share. The facility will sell power to NAA under a long-term supply contract.
Tokyo Gas said it has already identified 200 hectares of land for the PV plant. It said the first 75 MW should go online by the end of 2030, with the remaining 105 MW scheduled for commissioning by the end of 2045.
“We have set a goal of reducing CO2 emissions from the energy used in airport facilities and commercial vehicles to virtually zero by 2050,” the companies said in a joint statement. “We plan to deploy large-scale solar power generation facilities and next-generation decarbonization technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/23/nanovue-offers-self-cleaning-solution-for-solar-panel-soiling/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 23, 2023",Nanovue offers self-cleaning solution for solar panel soiling,"From pv magazine Australia
Nanoveu has created a hydrophilic self-cleaning nano-coating for solar panels that it claims can mitigate potential-induced degradation while delivering reduced cleaning costs in PV power systems in dry, humid environments.
The ASX-listed Nanovue said it has successfully expanded its Nanoshield product suite that purportedly includes the E-series hard coat, an antimicrobial coating that is self-maintaining, anti-fouling, anti-static, and hydrophilic.
The transparent coating, which was developed from the company’s antiviral products, has been designed initially to inhibit the growth of algae and lichen on solar panels. It said algae growth is a major issue for solar systems deployed in tropical conditions and if left unchecked, can cause up to 26% energy loss in the module’s generation capacity. In addition to preventing algae growth, the company said the E-series coating’s hydrophilic and anti-static properties inhibit sand, dirt and all other surface contaminants clinging to panels.
Nanoveu Managing Director Alfred Chong said the coating’s self-cleaning properties mean contaminants wash away with rainwater.
“As opposed to water-repellent coatings, the hydrophilic effect reduces the angle of water droplets, allowing penetration beneath the contaminant,” the company said. “Antistatic, larger particle sized debris such as dirt and sand simply slide off the surface.”
Chong claimed that the unique properties of the coating makes it suitable as a self-cleaning solution for solar systems in both humid and dry climates.
“With this new and unique development, we will work towards establishing Nanoveu as an attractive solution to enhance the performance of solar assets worldwide,” he said.
Soiling of solar panels remains a major issue for the industry with the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA-PVPS) estimating that lost revenue from PV module soiling amounts to more than AUD 4.67 billion ($3.2 billion) per year.
IEA-PVPS estimates that in 2018, soiling caused at least a 3% to 4% loss to global annual energy production from PV. This is expected to increase to around 4% to 5%, and $6 billion to $10 billion this year.
Nanoveu is currently testing the efficiency of the Nanoshield product in the Philippines, with 55 MW of solar projects identified as suitable sites for the technology. The results of the trials are expected to be published in the first half of this year.
Nanoveu said Nanoshield could be applied to other applications, such as ships and boat hulls that constantly require treatment.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/02/23/netherlands-raises-fee-for-solar-module-recycling/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 23, 2023",Netherlands raises fee for solar module recycling,"The Dutch government has announced plans to raise the fee for solar module recycling from July 1.
“Originally, the fee was €6.50 per ton of sold panels, but it will be increased to €40 per ton,” Jan Willem Jehee, manager operations at Stichting Zonne-energie Recycling Nederland (ZRN), told pv magazine, noting that the new rate will apply at least up to the end of 2025. “The fee will be used for solar panel recycling, so it will not be used to subsidize anything. It is meant as a buffer to be able to keep stable pricing in the future, when the waste streams will rise sharply.”
PV module importers will have to pay the fee to the OPEN Foundation, which is a Dutch nongovernmental organization.
“OPEN Foundation will establish the guarantee fund in line with the conditions that were agreed with the market,” ZRN said in a statement. “One important precondition in this is that a level playing field is created. This means that Open will take the steps required to ensure that each Dutch manufacturer or Dutch importer pays the recycling charge.”
An unspecified research agency has provided OPEN Foundation with a list of Dutch importers. All of the unregistered importers on the list will be approached by OPEN Foundation, in order to reach full compliance. In addition, preparations are being made for the introduction of a visible recycling fee.
“A visible recycling fee entails having a separate line on the invoice that specifies the amount paid for recycling,” said Jehee.
ZNR claimed that the guarantee fund will help the sector to meet the conditions of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive.
“One of the legislator’s demands is that there are always enough resources to pay for the recycling of solar panels,” ZNR added. “In now establishing this guarantee fund, this demand is met and the rates in the future can remain stable and predictable.”
