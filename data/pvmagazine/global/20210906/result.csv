Commissioner Simson described photovoltaics as a “golden thread running through each of the [EU's climate] policies,” at this morning's opening session of an event which is this year chaired by João Serra, of the University of Lisbon.
With the online conference and exhibition to run until Friday, the first of four panel discussions took place today, with a two-part subject to open the expert forums.
The European event is dedicated to solar research, technology and PV applications and the first panel discussion today – Managing performance and sustainability at the terawatt scale – examined how leaps in computing power are influencing solar cell modeling, manufacturing, maintenance, site selection, forecasting and modeling entire energy systems.
A second session – Resource efficiency of PV in production, use and disposal – considered just how sustainable solar power can claim to be.
With the panel discussions available for viewing at the EU PVSEC website, tomorrow's gathering of experts will look ‘Towards ultimate single-junction silicon cells – industry perspective.' Representatives from Chinese solar giants Longi and TrinaSolar, German solar production line equipment maker RCT-Solutions and Swiss and Taiwanese universities EPFL and NTU, respectively, will ponder whether PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell tech) will remain the dominant single-junction cell format in the multi-terawatt solar era; whether 182mm or 210mm wafers will prevail; and which of TOPCon, heterojunction and interdigitated back-contact will carve out a bigger market share.
Wednesday's panel will discuss how a PV-backed transition to a 100% renewable energy system can be achieved and Thursday's event concerns tandem solar cells and their potential to be the ‘game-changer' technology so many PV commentators are predicting they will be.
With so much innovation due to come under the spotlight, pv magazine will be in attendance to bring you developments as they happen.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/06/co-evaporated-perovskite-solar-cell-with-19-5-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2021",Co-evaporated perovskite solar cell with 19.5% efficiency,"Scientists from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany have developed a 19.5%-efficient perovskite solar cell via the thermal co-evaporation method, which involves a thin layer coating. The source material evaporates in a high vacuum chamber.
Compared to solution-based techniques, which the research group described as highly sensitive to solvent choice, process conditions, and even process atmosphere, the co-evaporation process is said to require fewer process parameters. The scientists said that the choice of substrate material and the crystallographic properties of the co-evaporated perovskite thin film are also decisive for the chemical reaction between lead(II) iodide (PbI2) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) in forming the cell perovskite absorber.
Controlling and monitoring the growth and composition of these two elements during co-evaporation is the main challenge of this manufacturing step.
“Columnar grain growth is identified as highly substrate dependent and as the key characteristic for high-quality co-evaporated perovskite absorbers,” the academics explained. “Perovskite thin-film morphologies without horizontal grain boundaries are commonly preferred.”
They fabricated the device with an undoped vacuum-processable hole transport material (HTM) called 2,2“,7,7”-tetra(N,N-di-p-tolyl)amino-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-TTB).
“The co-evaporation of the perovskite absorber in this layer stack sequence results in the desired homogenous columnar grain growth of the perovskite thin film,” the researchers said, noting that this was the decisive factor in achieving a stabilized efficiency of 19%.
They claimed that the simplified device architecture on the hole transport layer (HTL) side and the use of a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer between the fullerene layer and the rear electrode, which facilitated better charge carrier transport and extraction, which in turn resulted in high values for fill factor and open-circuit voltage.
“These devices are among the best reported all-evaporated perovskite solar cells without a solvent-based step in any of the utilized functional layers,” they said.
The best solar cell build under this configuration achieved a power conversion efficiency of 19.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.08 V, a fill factor of 83.0%, and a short-circuit current of 21.6 mA cm.
Researcher Tobias Abzieher said that the commercialization of perovskite-based PV is on its way. He said he is confident that the vapor-based route will be of significant importance for this step.
“While the general process equipment itself is already available from other thin-film technologies and should at least partially be able to be transferable to the deposition of perovskite-based semiconductors, the exact process engineering is still something that requires some research effort, which is however under heavy research these days,” he told pv magazine.
The scientists described the solar cell in “From Groundwork to Efficient Solar Cells: On the Importance of the Substrate Material in Co-Evaporated Perovskite Solar Cells,” which was recently published in Advanced Functional Materials.

In 2021, we can expect further reshuffling of positions in the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) ranking, as soaring system costs lead to delays and contract renegotiations for some PV projects. Even EPCs in the United States may struggle to complete individual projects this year as a result of the latest blockage on some PV module imports.
For EPC providers, the location of the business determined its success in 2020. The Covid-19 lockdowns brought back a concentrated PV market, in which more than half of the world’s non-residential PV additions were located in mainland China or the United States. Adding on Vietnam, where the commercial segment soared in 2020, the top three markets contributed to 61% of added non-residential PV last year. In contrast, non-residential PV installations declined by 17% in the rest of the world, compared to 2019. The result was that among the 10 largest EPC providers, four conducted all or the majority of business in mainland China and another four were solely focused on the United States.
In sharp contrast to mainland China and the United States, India experienced a drastic 52% year-on-year decline in installations. The market contraction resulted in a slow-down for most locally active players and a subsequent loss of global market share. No Indian companies were among the 10 largest in 2020 and only two – Sterling and Wilson and Tata Power – remained among the 30 largest in the ranking.
Source: IHS Markit
Out of the 30 largest PV integrators in 2019, 21 installed less capacity in 2020, and 13 even fell out of the top-30 ranking. While many were struggling globally, six companies actually grew to surpass one GW of installations for the first time. Mainly thanks to strong market growth in China and the United States, they joined the seven integrators that were already in the gigawatt league. In all, the 30 largest EPC providers installed 36 GW of nonresidential PV systems, representing 28% of the global PV market. This is a continued increase from 27% in 2019 and 21% in 2018. Of those 30 EPC providers, 16 executed projects in several markets. The rest concentrated on projects in singular markets, most often in their home markets.
PowerChina kept its position as the leading integrator of PV systems in the world, installing more than twice the PV capacity of the runner-up, China Energy Engineering Group. By exceeding 6 GW of installations in mainland China and another gigawatt in overseas markets, PowerChina grew its global market share to 6% in 2020, up from 3% in 2019. Blattner Energy and Swinerton Renewable Energy rose to third and fourth position as they shared a fifth of the EPC market for PV plants in the United States. Spain’s Prodiel took the fifth position by being the largest EPC provider both in Spain and Latin America.
For several years now, the business of providing EPC services for PV plants has been challenging for many companies. As the industry has grown around expectations of sharp system price reductions, the margins across the value chain have diminished, often squeezing the EPC provider. Clients have increasingly absorbed module procurement, leaving less revenue for the EPC. At the same time, the EPC providers have needed financial strength to navigate the construction process. In several cases over the past years, poorly timed cashflows have sunk entire companies. To counteract the risks and raise profitability, many major EPC providers have branched out to develop projects over the years, leading to a trend of more integrated developer-EPCs gaining positions in our ranking. In 2020, however, pure-play EPC providers performed more strongly than the vertically integrated companies.
The strong performance of pure-play EPCs can be attributed to the strong U.S. market where developers show a preference for third-party turn-key contracting. Banks that finance PV projects in the United States often want a single counterparty to take on the construction risk. Overall higher system pricing also helps to preserve margins across the U.S. value chain. We will see if pure-play EPCs will continue to dominate the U.S. solar PV market in the coming boom years, or if a possible lack of qualified providers will instead push developers to build up in-house EPC departments.
In the rest of the world, we project a continued trend of more EPCs expanding their development capabilities to gain control of the pipeline and boost margins. Developers and financiers that aim to minimize the total project costs often see less value in the EPC role but are not that interested in taking on construction and performance risks. To improve business, EPC providers will need to convince clients of their contribution to project performance and the value of proper risk allocation. Companies that will position well in our future rankings will either follow the vertical integration trend and build in-house developed projects or gain contracts with investors that have acquired project rights and are ready to pay for turn-key construction. We may also see a few EPC providers absorbed by utilities and large IPPs that insource project construction.
In most major PV markets across the world, last year’s sharp increase in PV system prices has directly hit the EPC contractors as they carry the procurement risk and need to meet contract deadlines. The exact impact on projects and companies hinges greatly on procurement and project delivery conditions. Many developers, EPCs, and suppliers have been renegotiating contracts to ensure the timely completion of projects planned for 2021. As for the future pipeline, the uncertainty regarding system prices paralyzed new procurement of components and services for several projects at the start of this year. Next year’s EPC ranking will reveal which companies successfully – through a combination of skills and luck – completed projects in 2021.

Swiss company Energy Pier has developed a new concept to build hybrid wind and solar plants along highways.
According to Laurent Jospin, an engineer at the company, the proposed solution is based on proven technology for rooftop PV. “The modules are designed in such a way that they have the highest possible degree of efficiency and can be replaced several times during the service life of the system so that the entire system always stays up to date with technological progress,” he explained.
Regarding the wind power unit, the company said that its load-bearing structure is designed in such a way that it creates an acceleration effect of air movement that is then used by its own AnemoGen, small scale wind generators, which are installed on both sides of the supporting pillars of the PV system deployed along the highway. “The rotor blades could absorb energy even with low air currents, and generate electricity via the generator,” the company explained. “The AnemoGen system is available in different sizes and is able to use both upstream and downstream air flows.”
Energy Pier believes that, with this approach, between 22,000 and 30,000 solar modules, and up to 320 AnemoGen generators, could be installed on every kilometer of a four-lane motorway. In addition, 162 pillars, to sustain the roof, should be deployed.
The company also emphasized the other advantages of its solution. For example, the protective wall and the roof ensure a considerable reduction in noise and the roof also protects the street from snowfall and sun. In summer, this offers protection from excessive heat and UV radiation, and in winter it makes snow-removal superfluous. In addition, the roof areas could also be used as rainwater collectors. The supporting structure, in turn, offers space for cables and other installations, such as emergency charging stations.
According to the company, which is already planning the first two demonstrators, the construction of the photovoltaic-and-wind combined power plants is also possible without interrupting traffic. One is being built in the municipality of Fully, in the canton of Valais. It is expected to have a length of 1,609m and to deliver around 50 GWh of green electricity per year.
The two pilot projects are planned in the Knonauer Amt district of the canton of Zurich. They will occupy a total area of 2,500m and generate around 78 GWh of solar and wind power annually.

The two parties last week revealed details of a tie-up which has already closed an €800,000 first round of fundraising and had, at the time of publication, raised almost €472,000 of their second, €630,000 slice of finance.
Gothenburg-based Trine offers small scale investors the chance to back solar projects with stakes of as little as €25. Gauteng-headquartered PV leasing business Solarise Africa installs solar arrays to generate power for commercial customers. Solarise retains ownership of the panels and is paid by the customer for the electricity consumed.
A spokesperson for Trine told pv magazine the initial €800,000 round of credit would finance five installations in Nairobi and Lake Victoria, in Kenya; and in Johannesburg and Polokwane, in South Africa. Although specific project details could not be disclosed, for commercial reasons, the spokesperson said the projects would have a total generation capacity of 2.5 MW, with a 1.8 MW system to be installed in addition to four 700 kW arrays.
Trine and Solarise Africa intend to extend the partnership into Ghana and Rwanda – where the latter already operates – with solar systems expected to be installed in those two countries from next year.

And though the batteries are needed to achieve decarbonization goals, the materials and processes used in battery manufacturing come with their own set of environmental concerns.
Battery electrodes are commonly manufactured using wet chemical processes requiring evaporation of toxic solvents, as well as drying at elevated temperatures requiring energy and space. The new process, developed by scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam Technology (IWS), offers an alternative that promises to be solvent-free with considerably lower energy consumption.
The new process proposed by Fraunhofer IWS deposits a film of lithium (or another electrode material) between two and twenty microns thick onto a current collector. The raw materials are similar to those used in current large-scale battery manufacturing, though solvents are replaced with a binding agent.
The materials are fed as a dry mixture into a calender gap – two rollers rotating in opposite directions, one faster than the other. The force generated by this forms a fine film on the faster moving roller, and is transferred onto a current collector foil. This can then be coated with carbon to reduce resistance, cut to size and stacked with the other components to form a full battery cell.
The group estimates that its process would require just one-third the equipment of space of solvent-based processes, as well as moving the energy-intensive drying process from battery manufacturing. They have set up prototype machinery for the process, which it calls dry transfer electrode coating, or DRYtraec, and say they have demonstrated its applicability for large-scale production.
DRYtraec can also be applied to a range of different battery materials and chemistries. “The range of possible uses for the technology is not limited to a particular cell chemistry,” explains Benjamin Schumm, group manager for chemical coatings technology at Fraunhofer IWS. “It could equally be used on lithium-ion cells as on lithium-sulfur or sodium-ion cells.”
The group says it is in discussion with various automobile and battery manufacturers about establishing pilot systems to test and refine the process in an industrial setting. Schumm further notes that the process could also be suitable for use in manufacturing ‘next generation’ energy storage technologies, such as solid-state batteries. “These [solid state batteries] will be increasingly important in the future, but the materials cannot tolerate wet chemical processing,” he says. “Thus, DRYtraec allows to offer a very promising solution.”

That will give the company “the largest output in the world for motive power lead-acid-flooded products,” said Sunlight, adding the investment would see the lead-acid output capability of its fab in Xanthi, northern Greece, rise from 4 GWh to 5.3 GWh per year.
Sunlight also has a 25,000-tons-per-year recycling plant for lead-acid batteries in Komotini from which it aims to source 60% of its lead-acid material requirements. The business owns battery assembly facilities in Verona, in Italy; and in North Carolina, in the U.S.

We considered whether adopting a circular approach could create a competitive edge and reap financial and reputational rewards. pv magazine also investigated what is already being done in the solar industry. Contact up@pv-magazine.com to find out more.
The balance of the €50 million cash injection will go into lithium-ion battery output, with Sunlight describing itself as a lithium-ion supplier on its LinkedIn page. That €20 million is set to fund 1.7 GWh of annual lithium-ion battery assembly capacity, in the form of three “assembly lines for lithium modules and complete lithium battery systems, as well as one assembly line for prototyping and R&D purposes.”
The raised lithium-ion assembly capacity is expected to enter production before October next year and Sunlight said it has reserved space to more than double its annual output to “almost 4 GWh.”
The Greek government will provide €49.9 million towards the cost of Sunlight's planned lithium-ion R&D center in Athens – with some likely to come from EU funds – after the European Commission’s directorate-general for competition last year approved the subsidy, under the EU's state aid rules.

“Definitely, some solar panel arrangements are better than others,” Merel Soons, professor of plant dispersal ecology and conservation at Utrecht University, told pv magazine. “Our study only included south-oriented solar panel arrays, which are much better for soil and vegetation than east-west oriented solar panel arrays, where light and water are limiting plant growth and soil functioning.”
The analyzed solar parks are located on greenfield land; conventional grassland; terrain pre-sown with flowery herbs; and terrain sown with grassland species. “For the Netherlands, it is the first time that these impacts were evaluated for a broad range of solar parks with different initial land uses,” Pita A Verweij, associate professor in land use and biodiversity at Utrecht, further explained. “In particular, in intensively used pastures and other low-biodiversity starting conditions, we found a biodiversity gain. Initial land use, therefore, matters.”
The two scientists recommend a distance between panel rows of at least 1.5 times panel height. “This would be enough [to leave] sufficient space for vegetation to develop naturally in between panel arrays,” Verweij also stated. “Rather than a lack of moisture or rainfall, the limiting factor for plant growth appeared to be light.”
In the study, the Dutch group explained that the vegetation cover, the species richness, and the Shannon diversity – which characterizes species diversity in a community – were reduced, compared to solar parks' surrounding areas. It also found that daytime temperatures and temperature fluctuations were lower under the PV modules, and that soil and air moisture levels were higher, compared to the surrounding areas.
The academics also found the species richness and Shannon diversity were reduced on the northern side of the solar panels and vegetation was taller, with a higher vegetation cover, which they linked to higher soil moisture. “South of panel arrays, vegetation and soil parameters were comparable to the control situation without solar panels,” they emphasized.
They also ascertained that lower species richness was strongly dependent on previous land use and was highest in parks with high initial biodiversity value. “It is therefore advised to avoid such areas in solar park allocation,” they highlighted. “By contrast, our findings suggest that enhancement of biodiversity is possible by planning solar parks in areas with low initial biodiversity value, and proper solar park design and management.
In August, the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) presented a new approach for building east-west oriented solar parks, which it claimed can prevent soil deterioration and offer the same yield as south-oriented PV plants.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/06/rooftop-pv-for-water-heating-a-residential-super-saver/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2021",Rooftop PV for water heating – a residential super saver,"From pv magazine Australia
Self consumption of rooftop solar-generated electricity is Australia’s cheapest electricity bet, never mind that sucking up the solar onsite helps electricity networks manage grid voltage and power quality at times of peak solar generation.
Although batteries are the logical answer to saving lunchtime solar for later, they’re still too pricey for most homeowners. A new study led by Dr. Baran Yildiz of the University of New South Wales’ School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering (SPREE) shows that storing excess lunchtime solar in a giant thermal battery – an electric hot water tank – can save them an extra AUD 100 ($74.35) a year on their electricity bills for minimal upfront investment.  And homeowners can still have 20% to 30% of their excess solar to play with.
“Hot water storage tanks can store more energy than a Tesla Powerwall, in thermal form,” Yildiz tells pv magazine Australia. And although that energy is not recoverable as electricity, it serves a relentless residential need – water heating typically makes up around 25% of a household’s electricity demand.
For the purposes of the study, Yildiz and the Collaboration on Energy and Environmental Markets (CEEM) team developed an intelligent water-heating control (IWHC) tool in collaboration with Solar Analytics, which channels excess rooftop generation into household water heaters. The IWHC makes its decisions based on a household’s PV generation characteristics, electricity consumption and hot water use patterns, and real-time energy monitoring.
The IWHC – a complexity of algorithms in a simple piece of hardware – was pitted against two commercially available tools: timer-based switching of excess solar energy into water heating, and more sophisticated diverter technology, which has so far not been widely adopted. The three technologies were each installed and tested in around 10 households and the resulting data was validated and parlayed into simulation models that were then applied to a broader set of electricity data from 380 Australian households in the greater Brisbane, greater Sydney, and greater Adelaide areas.
Although the diverter tech came out on top in terms of savings delivered, at an average of AUD 170 a year, its higher upfront cost means that the cheaper IWHC, delivering AUD 100 average savings, is a more cost-effective solution. The timer came in at AUD 80 of average annual savings.
The results indicate that “on average, households can utilize 2.4 kWh, 1.8 kWh and 3.4 kWh, of daily excess distributed-PV generation for water heating, using the IWHC, timer and diverter, respectively,” Yildiz says in his paper, “Assessment of control tools for utilizing excess distributed photovoltaic generation in domestic electric water heating systems,” which was published in the Oct. 15 edition of Applied Energy.
The outcomes were surprising to Yildiz on a number of fronts. Firstly, he says the research showed that “we can provide 48%, almost half, the daily requirement of energy for heating water using excess solar generation while providing 100% customer comfort.” That is, you’ll always get a nice hot shower.
Then, he says the fact that there’s still residual – between 20% and 30% – excess solar, opens up the possibilities of further deploying this cheapest energy source for other household duties, such as “pre-heating or pre-cooling the house, or for charging electric vehicles,” or for timely use of an electric pool pump or pool heater.
Professor Alistair Sproul, the head of school at SPREE, emphasizes the benefits of using excess solar to keep hot water topped up compared to the now old-world idea of heating water with off-peak energy – at night, when demand used to be at its lowest.
Off-peak electricity tariffs (discounted between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.) were introduced “when New South Wales had an abundance of coal-generated electricity and it wanted to keep them running – you don’t want to ramp these things down too much overnight,” Sproul told pv magazine Australia.
Off-peak electricity tariffs, he explains, were introduced to push gas-fired hot-water heating out of the game. “They were deliberately designed to cannibalize the gas industry, so the electricity industry could flourish,” he said.
Despite the fact that demand is now often overwhelmed during the middle of the day by an abundance of PV generation, and wholesale electricity prices can spin into the negative, electricity retailers are still propping up night-time demand by offering “off-peak” rates.
“The off-peak electricity tariff in New South Wales is probably now 12 to 14 cents per kilowatt-hour between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.,” said Sproul. “But what’s the lifecycle cost of PV coming off your roof?”
He calculates that rooftop PV, installed at even AUD 2,000 per kilowatt (which is at the higher end of the range) “is about seven or eight cents a kilowatt hour – to the consumer who uses it.”
“Baran’s paper shows that if you can avoid buying electricity from the grid, even at 12 cents a kilowatt-hour off-peak, by using your PV excess in the middle of the day to heat your water, you can make savings,” said Sproul.
Self consumption of rooftop solar also has environmental benefits in that the electricity generated is immediately used on site rather than being exported to the grid for use elsewhere. That is, any transmission of electrons results in losses along the line, whittling away at the original bounty of renewable energy.
Yildiz said the outcomes of SPREE’s hot-water-as-a-super-solar-soaker study have already informed the Australian Energy Market Commission’s plans to better integrate energy storage systems into the National Electricity Market. And energy distribution network service providers, such as AusGrid, Energy Queensland, and Endeavour Energy are keen to apply the IWHC technology, which will likely be scaled up in the near future.
“With this paper, we wanted to show that it’s fine to invest in batteries,” said Yildiz. “But we already have hot water heaters – why don’t we implement this easy, low-hanging fruit first?”

Indian automotive components manufacturer Lucas TVS has partnered with U.S.-based 24M Technologies to manufacture semi-solid lithium-ion cells based on 24M’s technology in India. The two companies recently announced the signing of a license and servicing agreement to set up the cell giga-factories.
The first plant will be built in Thervoy Kandigai, Gummudipundi, near Chennai in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Production at the Chennai plant is expected to start in the second half of 2023. 
Lucas TVS plans to grow the capacity of the Chennai plant to a globally competitive scale of 10 GWh in two stages, according to a company statement. It also plans to build plants throughout India to support the growing energy storage, electric mobility, and lead-acid battery replacement markets.
Massachusetts-based 24M describes its SemiSolid manufacturing process as a simple, space-efficient, low-cost, modular approach to lithium-ion battery manufacturing. The process, designed around the use of standard lithium-ion supply chain materials, is expected to produce greater than 50% capex savings versus conventional manufacturing lines.
The process, protected by more than 80 issued and 100 pending patents, enables the production of a thicker electrode, increasing energy density and reducing materials costs. Beyond its cost advantages, 24M’s patented cell design enhances safety, reliability, and traceability by virtually eliminating potential metal contamination, the most common cause of shorts in conventional lithium-ion cells. In addition, the SemiSolid electrode eliminates the use of binders and thereby enables the simplest and most efficient recycling of rejected or end-of-life cells. 
The SemiSolid platform offers innovative solutions to the fast-growing storage and electric mobility markets and the emerging lead-acid battery replacement markets. The U.S. company is already planning large capacities in Japan, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations region, Europe, and the United States. Lucas TVS will be the first to introduce SemiSolid lithium-ion batteries produced in India and specifically designed for the Indian market.
Lucas TVS plans to build products using different chemistries, in Pouch and Prismatic cell formats, with high energy density. The products will meet customer needs in e-mobility, stationary energy storage – including grid-scale markets – and lead-acid battery replacement. Lucas TVS will also offer complete battery solutions.
“Lucas TVS believes in investing in the next-generation technologies, which is why we chose to partner with 24M,” said T.K. Balaji, chairman and managing director of Lucas TVS. “We are confident that their innovative SemiSolid platform technology will enable us to provide our customers affordable e-mobility, lead-acid battery replacement, and storage solutions with improved quality and best-in-class safety.”
Naoki Ota, chief executive officer of 24M, said that the company's SemiSolid technology and ongoing R&D investments will support plans by Lucas TVS to take the lead in the energy storage space for mobility, lead-acid battery replacement, storage and grid-scale markets in India.

The two sides signed a $27 billion framework agreement on Sunday.
The agreement includes three contracts between the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and the French Company Total, and the fourth contract for the solar energy project between the Ministry of Electricity and Total.

France24, citing Agence France-Presse, reported that the three contracts signed with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil are related to a seawater pipeline extending from the Persian Gulf to the country's southern oilfields, an increase in production at the Artawi oilfield, and the construction of a complex to exploit production from the sector's gas fields. The news outlets did not reveal any other details about the PV project, however.
The plant will add to two giant solar projects currently under development in the country. State-owned Power Construction Corp. of China (PowerChina) is planning to build 2 GW across several locations. And UAE-based developer Masdar signed an agreement with Iraq's government in June to build a 2 GW solar project.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Iraq has just 216 MW of installed PV capacity, despite having huge solar potential. No additional solar power has been deployed in the country over the last three years. In 2017, Iraq’s installed power generation capacity – mainly based on fossil fuels – stood at around 11.3 GW, versus demand estimated at about 17 GW.
