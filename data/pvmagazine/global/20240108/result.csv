Germany-based solar project developer BEC-Energie Consult GmbH has developed a self-supporting mounting structure for ground-mounted PV projects.
The company said it is now testing its patented “BECU” system at a 7 MW pilot facility in Sonneberg, Germany.
“The core idea of the patent is to exploit the self-supporting capacity of the photovoltaic module frame through the simplest, most stable, low-maintenance and space-saving installation possible in rows or blocks,” the company said.
The structure is south-oriented, with an incline of 9 degrees to 10 degrees.
“The holder reinforcing bar system, which leaves a gap of between 10 cm and 20 cm between the rows of modules depending on the design of the holder, consists of a galvanized reinforcing bar and 10 specially developed module holders,” said BEC-Energie Consult.
The reinforcing bars are driven into the ground up to 1.3 meters deep using a ram or caulking hammer, depending on the quality of the soil.
BEC-Energie Consult claims that its transport costs are lower. It said that its structures could also be used in ground-level agrivoltaic projects, if designed appropriately.
Livestock could be kept below the modules, said BEC-Energie Consult. It is now working on enabling ground-level vegetable cultivation with the help of small, autonomously operating robots.
In a classic ground-mounted system with the “BECU” substructure, system owners could achieve 1.45 MW of output per hectare, according to the company. For ground-level agricultural PV systems, 1.2 MW per hectare could be achieved.

The scientists explained that silver-alloyed CIGS (ACIGS) PV devices require a production process that needs lower evaporation temperatures and enables lower energy bandgaps.
“This investigation aims to explore the impact of fabrication conditions, such as the processing temperature or amount of silver (Ag) added,” they stated. “Our objective is to enhance the current density for fabricating high-efficiency perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells with the potential to achieve efficiencies exceeding 30%.”
The research group fabricated different cell samples, in which copper (Cu) and selenium (Se) were evaporated at substrate temperatures ranging from 340 C to 470 C. The fabrication process, across all samples, started with an ultra-thin layer of Ag. Then, a three-stage co-evaporation process was initiated. In its first stage, indium (In), gallium (Ga), and Se were supplied at a temperature of approximately 340 C.
The second stage consisted of evaporating Cu and Se at substrate temperatures ranging from 340 C to 470 C until a Cu-rich CIGS phase was formed. In the third and final stage, In, Ga, and Se were evaporated onto the substrate at the same temperature as in the second stage.
After completing the three-stage process, the films were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis.
The scientists fabricated the cell with a glass substrate, a buffer layer made of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), the ACIGS absorber, a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, a window layer of zinc oxide (i-ZnO), and an aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO) window layer.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the cell, processed at a temperature of 340 C, reached an efficiency of 15.4%.
When processed at temperatures of 440 C, the device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 17.7%. “The cell's short-circuit density can be controlled by the processing temperature in the ACIGS configuration,” they stated. “These results emphasize the significance of understanding the deposition temperature and its impact on the properties of ACIGS films, paving the way for further advancements in solar-cell technology.”
The solar cell design was presented in the paper “Exploring the deposition pathway in the notch region of double-graded bandgap ACIGS solar cells,” published in the Journal of Science: Advanced Materials and Devices. “This study demonstrates correlations between element diffusion behavior and notch-point formation in ACIGS films, which ultimately influence the resulting current circuit voltage and fill factor,” the scientists concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/08/chinas-floating-pv-potential-estimated-at-862-6-gw/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",BERNADETTE GEYER,"JANUARY 8, 2024",China’s floating PV potential estimated at 862.6 GW,"A team of researchers from China has assessed the potential for floating photovoltaics (FPV) in China and found that the technology can address regional differences in land and water availability for PV systems while simultaneously helping to meet the country’s growing energy demand.
According to the scientists, the installation of terrestrial PV (TPV) projects in places where demand is highest faces serious constraints due to low land availability and high rental costs.
“The emergence of floating photovoltaics (FPV) provides an alternative to solve the tension between increasing solar energy demand and the constraint posed by land availability, especially in eastern China,” the researchers noted. “For the three northern areas, there are abundant land resources while limiting the potential for FPV. For east and south China, where economic activity is more developed, FPV can largely alleviate the land constraint in developing solar power.”
For the evaluation of the potential for TPV systems, the team used the GIS-based multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to estimate available land area, selecting areas with an altitude less than or equal to 3000 m and with total radiation greater than or equal to 1,600 kWh/m2, 1,300 kWh/m2, and 1,100 kWh/m2 for three different China's macro-regions dubbed Class I, II, and III solar resource areas, respectively.
The researchers excluded natural lakes from consideration since FPVs can block sunlight from the water surface and damage their ecological environment. Therefore, to estimate the potential for FPV installed capacity, the paper includes 875 representative reservoirs – 76% of China’s total.
The results of the assessment show that the higher power-generation efficiency of FPV more than compensates for the higher initial investment cost compared with TPV. This means that in areas of China where electricity tariffs are higher or solar is more abundant, the lifetime economic payback of FPV can outperform that of TPV.
Researchers found the potential installed FPV capacity could reach as high as 862.6 GW with a potential annual power output of up to 1,423.8 TWh. It was also estimated that FPVs could reduce water evaporation by about 5.8 km3 per year, while conserving 7,117.3 km2 of land. “On average, FPV systems located in Tibet, Guangdong, and Hainan gain the highest economic payback,” they said, noting that the Hubei, Guangxi, and Jiangsu provinces have the greatest potential for FPV due to their abundant water resources.
The team noted that the abundant hydropower resources would make co-deployment with FPV advantageous in Sichuan and Guangxi in particular. This coordination could stabilize PV energy output and compensate for seasonal fluctuations in hydropower output.
As for the paper’s assessment of TPV resources, the researchers recommend differing targeted promotion types among the provinces for distributed solar PV (DSPV). For example, in developed urban areas – such as in Guangdong and Jiangsu – DSPV for the commercial and industrial sectors should be prioritized, while populated provinces could focus on residential PV in rural areas.
“The total carbon emission reduction potential derived from FPV can reach 1078.6 Mt per year,” the paper states. “Guangxi, Hubei, and Hunan would gain the greatest carbon emission reduction benefits due to their high potential installed capacity. For Henan and Jilin, their thermal power carbon emissions are relatively high, so these two provinces also gain considerable carbon emission reduction benefits.”
The scientists introduced their findings in the study “Assessment of floating solar photovoltaic potential in China,” which was published in Renewable Energy. The paper’s authors included researchers from Beijing Normal University, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, and the Shenzhen Oriental Fortune Capital Investment Management Company Limited.

According to the Environmental Registry of Ontario, the government of Ontario is proposing to “accelerate” new electricity generation in the renewable-rich province, which installed 2.7 GW of solar in 2022.
Changes center on commercial and industrial customers being able to offset their electricity demand by establishing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with renewable generation facilities, spanning wind, solar, biofuel, battery storage and hydropower less than 10 MW.
OFA submitted written feedback to the policy change, which included seven recommendations.
The OFA said regulators prioritizing energy and storage infrastructure sited on commercial and industrial land should “discourage” projects sited on land with certain soils; “prime” agricultural areas, as well as lower priority agricultural lands and rural land, should be considered as a last resort for renewables to protect “Ontario’s finite and declining farm lands”; and developers should be “contractually obligated” to restore environments and land after a renewable project is decommissioned or in the case of a “system failure event.”
Programs establishing net metering systems “must” include collaboration between developers, landowners, local government and the public; and there should be improved public engagement to “encourage compromise between grid capacity restrictions limiting site options, and host site objections,” the OFA said.
Community consultation ran from Nov. 2 to Dec. 17, 2023, with the proposed start date for the amendment change slated for May 1, 2024.
The amendment follows the release of the government’s Powering Ontario’s Growth plan in 2023, which aims to procure 4 GW of new electricity, support new investments, electrify the economy and power 1.5 million new homes to house the province’s growing population. Planning the state’s next competitive electricity procurement process – focused on wind, solar, hydroelectric, batteries and biogas – is one of the policy prongs.
Meanwhile, the Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanREA) last month welcomed the news that the Government of Ontario’s Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) would procure 5 GW of new wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy in a new tender exercise. The move will provide “long-term procurement certainty for the market,” according to CanREA.
“This announcement provides a clear signal to our members that Ontario is ready for new renewable projects,” said CanREA’s director for Ontario, Eric Muller. “This procurement will be a significant opportunity for our members to develop low-cost wind, solar and energy storage in Ontario to meet the province’s growing needs.”
Canada recorded 4.4 GW of solar installed capacity at the end of 2022, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

The new prosumers generate an additional 37.935 MW of capacity from renewable energy facilities, which the ERC says supports their own consumption or, if there is any excess, is exported or sold to the distribution system.
Most (3,200) of the new registrations are located on the country’s largest island, Luzon, while 722 are on Visayas, and 202 are on Mindanao.
The ERC has entered into an agreement with electric power distribution company Meralco and the City Government of Pasig, and another with More Electric and Power Corp. and the City Government of Iloilo, to set up one-stop shops increasing public awareness of the net-metering programme and facilitating applications to the scheme. It plans to continue this work in 2024.
“The Net Metering Program is one of the cornerstones of energy democracy,” said ERC Chairperson and CEO Monalisa C. Dimalanta. “It allows for consumers to produce their own power and even supply others with electricity beyond their own needs.”
“We are committed to enabling all our consumers to have a greater hold of our energy destiny as we continue to streamline the permitting requirements and make it easier for end-users to enjoy the benefits of the programs.”
Since the implementation of the net-metering programme in 2015, the ERC has issued a total of 11,707 COCs, equivalent to 101.251 MW of capacity.
In November 2022, Philippines increased its net-metering size limit to 1 MW, up from a 100 kW threshold introduced in 2008.
The Philippines aims to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030, according to a 2022 report by the International Renewable Energy Agency.

Researchers from the Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science based at RMIT, Monash University, and Australia’s national science agency, CSIRO, say they have been able to remove the element of human error with the help of artificial intelligence in rapidly developing perovskite solar cells.
Perovskites are thin-film semiconductors with well-documented challenges in commercialising and scaling up their production. While high efficiencies have been produced in lab conditions, these have proved difficult to replicate in production.
These easily synthesized materials are considered the future of solar cells, with properties ideal for enabling low-cost, efficient photovoltaics. Perovskites are also predicted to play a role in upcoming electric vehicle batteries, sensors, and lasers, among other things.
The research team has been able to create reproducible perovskite solar cells with power-conversion efficiencies of 16.9%, which is the best-known result manufactured without human intervention.
“A reproducible 16.9% power-conversion efficiency is better than an irreproducible 30%,” explained Dr. Nastaran Meftahi, lead author of the study that has just been published in Advanced Energy Materials. “What we have achieved is the development of a method for rapidly and reproducibly making and testing new solar cells, where each generation learns from and improves upon the previous.”
The researchers have shown that the model will be capable of predicting huge volumes of promising chemical recipes for new perovskite solar cells.
Dr. Adam Surmiak at Monash University and Professor Udo Bach at the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics and CSIRO will lead a new facility currently under construction to run the new model automated system for solar cell manufacturing.
“Critically, our machine learning model represents the starting point for further optimisation, both in terms of power-conversion efficiency and stability,” Meftahi said, adding that this machine-learning model and automated system has the potential to process data and run tests on other types of solar cells, including those made with silicon or organic materials.
“We are keen to work with partners in industry to further test and prototype our work so that it can be possibly commercialised in a range of applications,” she said.

This creates a complex landscape where it becomes vital for manufacturers and suppliers of BIPV products to understand and adhere to a multitude of standards in different markets, and to recognize that the fire safety testing of conventional PV products is already deficient.
With this in mind, a group of scientists at the Norwegian institute Rise Fire Research has developed a fire test for both small and large-scale BIPV façades. “Large-scale system tests of BIPV systems are lacking and this should be requested from more BIPV projects,” Rise researcher, Reidar Stølen, told pv magazine. “More experiments in realistic scales would be very interesting to see. So if anyone can share information from other tests of complete systems, this can be a way forward to see which parameters are crucial to designing truly fire-safe BIPV façades.”

The scientists concluded that the test results showed the importance of details in mounting BIPV façades and proper documentation from relevant fire tests of such systems. “Despite complying to IEC EN 61730 and EN 13501-1, the complete façade system failed to prevent modules from falling from the façade and vertically propagating fire in the cavity,” Stølen explained. “The cone calorimeter tests also show that the amount of combustible materials is limited in the modules, but that it ignites quite easily and burns with a high heat release rate.”
In another recent work, RISE researchers conducted a series of experiments indicating that the distance between solar modules and rooftop surfaces could be a crucial factor in PV system fires. A similar study, published by the University of Edinburgh and the Technical University of Denmark, showed similar results. The scientists analyzed fire dynamics and flame spread on the substrate beneath panels. They concluded that the shorter the distance between the panels and rooftop, the higher the probability of larger and more destructive fires.

Tindo Solar plans to increase in its manufacturing capacity more than six-fold, outlining plans to build a AUD 90 million ($60 million) to AUD 100 million facility in eastern Australia that will produce about 2 million panels per year, equivalent to 1 GW of capacity per annum.
The South Australia-based company, which currently operates a 150 MW factory at Mawson Lakes in Adelaide’s northern suburbs, has yet to settle on a location for the new facility but said sites in regional New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria are being considered.
Tindo said the new plant, which is expected to be operational by the end of 2025, will have the capacity to produce 7,000 panels per day, helping meet the estimated 22,000 PV panels which the company predicts will need to be installed each day to meet Australia’s 2030 decarbonization targets.
“There is a clear need for Australia to build sovereign capability in renewables manufacturing, and to ensure there is more Australian-made content in the vast amount of clean energy infrastructure required as we decarbonise our electricity system,” said Tindo Chief Executive Officer Richard Petterson.
As well as supplying panels across Australia, Tindo said output from the facility would be used to increase its export market, boosting Australia’s presence in the renewables market.
Petterson said the plant has been developed in response to federal and state government calls for more domestic renewables manufacturing and the scale of the proposed facility will help catalyse a domestic upstream supply chain.
“Governments across the country have recognised that now is the time to be putting in place the right mechanisms to make Australia a renewables manufacturing superpower,” he said, adding that government support is needed to help Australian companies to compete with international rivals.
“The United States’ Inflation Reduction Act and China’s ongoing support for its renewables manufacturers show that some level of price support, possibly through a production credit, is critical to help industry scale,” he said.
Petterson said this type of short-term support would unlock huge investment in Australia, create thousands of jobs and ensure the nation shares in more of the benefits of the global energy transition.
“We want Tindo’s gigafactory to be at the heart of this domestic strategy, supplying Australian-made, high-quality solar panels to developers and installers, while sourcing component parts from local suppliers,” he said.
Tindo said it is already in talks with local manufacturers of glass, aluminium and other components that would be needed to support the new gigafactory and has secured Letters of Intent from potential offtakers and has attracted interest from strategic partners.

The key feature of the system is a larger distance between the solar modules compared to conventional solar tree designs. This approach is intended to reduce shading losses between the panels while improving cooling and heat dissipation.
The prototype has a total diameter of 660 mm and relies on solar modules based on cells provided by Shenzhen Xiangxinrui Solar Energy Co., Ltd. China. Each panel has a size of 180 mm x 60 mm x 3 mm and an efficiency of 22%.  The solar tree also relies on a stem measuring 1800 mm in height and a flat wooden sheet segmented into fifteen branches.
In order to validate the proposed design, the scientists compared its performance with that of a flat PV system with the same characteristics. “Both the solar tree and the flat module were integrated and configured within the same electrical circuit, featuring six rings connected in parallel,” the scientists explained. “Each ring consisted of three modules connected in series, resulting in a total of eighteen PV modules.”

Both the solar tree and the flat PV system were tested with a south orientation and tilt angles of 20, 30 and 45 degrees.
The tests revealed that with the 45-degree angle the solar tree recorded a maximum temperature of 38.05 C and the flat system had 49.8 C. As a result, the solar tree configuration yielded a maximum power output of 14.54 W, while the flat system produced 11.8 W.
Under the 30-degree tilt angle configuration, the flat system reached a temperature of 51.3 C and the solar tree reached 40.75 C. The latter achieved a maximum power output of 13.84 W, compared to 11.05 W for the flat system. With the 20-degree tilt angle, the solar tree reached a maximum temperature of 33.95 C and the flat system of 43.86 C. The former produced 14.05 W and the latter 11.4 W.

“Empirical results indicate that the flat PV module's temperature exceeds the solar tree's by over 10 C, owing to the less efficient convective heat transfer,” the academics stated, adding that the temperatures of the ground shaded by the solar tree were reduced by 3–7 C compared to the unshaded ground. “The efficiency of the solar module configuration proposed herein witnessed an increment of 16–23 % relative to the flat module.”
The researchers also observed that the solar tree offers a land footprint reduction of 96 % compared with the conventional PV systems.
“An examination of the ground footprint revealed that the sunflower PV module afforded 85 % land savings relative to the flat PV module,” they stated. “The area under the solar PV tree can be used for parking and agriculture purposes.”
Their findings were presented in the study “Sunflower solar tree vs. flat PV module: A comprehensive analysis of performance, efficiency, and land savings in urban solar integration,” published in Results in Engineering.
Researchers from the Korea Maritime Institute recently proposed the use of solar trees to build photovoltaic plants in mountainous forest areas in land-scarce South Korea. They defined the new concept as forest-photovoltaic and explained that it would both maintain carbon absorption activities under the solar trees and produce solar power on the upper part of forest land.
Other researchers from Amity University, Noida, in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, recently developed four different designs for solar photovoltaic trees that purportedly require less physical space than conventional PV systems in urban environments.

Tesla has released an API for solar, Powerwall battery energy storage systems, and electric vehicle chargers.
An API is a software intermediary that allows applications to communicate with each other. The new API will enable third parties to interact with software controlling home energy components.
The company released an API in October for electric vehicle fleet management. Now, its API supports the coordination of distributed energy assets.
Tesla has increasingly been implementing software plans to coordinate distributed energy assets in programs like virtual power plants (VPP).  Developers can find the API here.
Tesla’s Powerwall will be a key component in VPP program implementation and fleet management. The company announced its third-generation Powerwall in September 2023.
The new battery has an energy capacity of 13.5 kW and offers continuous on-grid power of 11.5 kW. The system measures 110 cm x 61 cm x 19.3 cm and weighs 130 kg.
The battery includes an inverter featuring six solar inputs with maximum power point trackers (MPPTs). The device has reportedly a solar-to-grid efficiency of 97.5%. The new product comes with a 10-year product warranty.
“PW3 is optimized for ease of installation & high power, which means that a single Powerwall can serve as an uninterruptible power supply for most homes,” said CEO Elon Musk. “This is a big deal for ensuring that the lights stay on and you can power all your devices in the event of a power outage.”
