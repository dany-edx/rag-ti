Developers recently commissioned two different agrivoltaic projects linked to wine production in Europe.
Iberdrola commissioned a 40 kW array at the vineyards of Gonzalez Byass and Emperor Group in Guadamur, Spain. The installation will use trackers controlled by an AI algorithm capable of determining the optimal position of the solar panels. The degree of inclination will be established based on information collected by the sensors in the vineyards, which record information related to solar radiation, soil humidity, wind conditions, or thickness of the vine trunk, among others.
González Byass and Grupo Emperador will use the electricity production from the solar array for its wineries located nearby. Iberdrola will monitor the results of the project over the next year and states that it plans to replicate the project in other wine farms in Spain.
Techedge and PVH, a manufacturer of trackers and mounting structures, have also worked on the project, which is being handled by Perseo, Iberdrola's startup program.
In a separate development, France's TotalEnergies and Ombrea said they have switched on their first agrivoltaic pilot on the Rivals wine estate in Aude, in southern France. The 85.6 kW project extends over an area of approximately 3,000 square meters. It features Ombrea's agrivoltaic system, which is controlled by an algorithm based on meteorological and agronomic data collected through sensors.
The pilot will shed light on plant physiology and photosynthetic activity, due to agronomic monitoring conducted in partnership with the French Institute of Vine and Wine (IFV), SudExpé and the Aude Chamber of Agriculture. The two companies said the first visual results for plant growth, water requirements, and temperature variation will be ready by as early as January 2023.
The companies plan to follow up on the research within five years.
“Thanks to the data collected and analyzed on this pilot, we will be able, with Ombrea, to refine our knowledge and offer operators high value-added solutions,” said Alexandre Morin, development director for TotalEnergies Renouvelables France.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/04/european-ppa-prices-rise-to-e0-1078-kwh/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"OCTOBER 4, 2022",European PPA prices rise to €0.1078/kWh,"An unprecedented year – that's how Swiss consultancy Pexapark has defined the 12-month period that started in September 2021. The gas crisis has turned into a broader energy crisis, triggering price uncertainty and pushing market volatility to stratospheric in August 2022. In Germany and France, one-year electricity contracts surpassed €1,000 ($987)/MWh for the first time, while in the Netherlands, it was negotiated at more than €300/MWh.
However, it seems that the intervention in the electricity markets that was recently approved by the European Commission has caused prices to drop significantly. In Germany, for example, prices are now below €500/MWh. However, as a consequence, 10-year PPAs for solar, onshore wind and offshore wind technology have doubled in price this year to an average of €107.80/MWh.
Higher risks and growing margin and collateral requirements are limiting the ability of market players to trade over the long term, with many refraining from signing new long-term PPA deals. Nonetheless, around 6.81 GW of capacity has been announced under PPAs since September 2021, compared to 5 GW in the same period a year earlier.
Volatility and tension in energy markets are expected to continue into the winter, with gas and electricity prices remaining high in the short to medium term. That will continue until significant new supplies are added, if demand eases, or if a major recession fundamentally changes the outlook.
That said, market intervention could lead to two different outcomes. In the best case scenario, it could help to reduce volatility and bring supply and demand into balance. In the worst case scenario, rapid, unilateral actions by countries could create additional uncertainty, which could cause investors to lose confidence and slow renewables expansion at a time when Europe needs it most.

The company is betting on the biological production of hydrogen in the subsurface through the consumption of trapped or abandoned resources. “Cemvita scientists increased microbe performance by six and a half times the rate needed to produce hydrogen at $1/kg, a key milestone necessary to advance the program toward commercialization,” said the Texas-based company. “The subsequent field trial was completed in the Permian basin with a partnering company, where the team successfully measured hydrogen concentrations three orders of magnitude above baseline.”
Deutsche Bahn and Australia's Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) have agreed on a cooperation plan. For their first project, the partners are working on modifying diesel engines for locomotives and traction vehicles to operate with ammonia and hydrogen. “The advantage over a pure hydrogen engine is that ammonia has a higher energy density than liquid hydrogen and is easier to transport and store,” wrote Deutsche Bahn. The ammonia-hydrogen engine features a cracker from Germany's Ammonigy. The cracker splits a small part of the ammonia outside the engine into hydrogen and nitrogen. The hydrogen produced is mixed with the remaining ammonia as an ignition gas. The first prototype of the engine is currently being tested on an engine test bench. 
Alberta‘s government has started talking to a number of Japanese companies about collaborating on LNG, hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol, said Dale Nally, the associate minister of natural gas and electricity in the Canadian province. “Alberta is committed to being a global leader in hydrogen and liquefied natural gas,” Nally said, noting that the province now accounts for about 90% of Canada's total oil sands production. Nally recently traveled to Japan to participate in Japan's Hydrogen Energy Ministerial Meeting and visit the Fukushima Hydrogen Energy Research Field. Canadian companies are currently in talks with Japanese companies such as Itochu and Mitsubishi. 
Argus has launched a suite of new hydrogen cost indicators on the economics of hydrogen production in the context of carbon capture. The price reporting agency said that it now publishes hydrogen costs and prices for more than 400 locations throughout the world. The decision comes at a moment when several companies, like ICIS, are increasing hydrogen reporting. 
The European Commission has approved a €134 million ($133.1 million) German measure to support BASF's production of renewable hydrogen under EU state aid rules. The objective is to decarbonize its chemical production processes and promote hydrogen use in the transport sector. The direct grant will support the construction of a 54 MW electrolyzer at BASF's site in Ludwigshafen, Germany. Operations are scheduled to start in 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/04/heterojunction-solar-cell-based-on-new-black-silicon-achieves-7-5-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,RUSSIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 4, 2022",Heterojunction solar cell based on new black silicon achieves 7.5% efficiency,"Scientists at the Institute of Automation and Control Processes in Russia have fabricated a heterojunction solar cell based on a novel kind of black silicon. The material reportedly has a higher near-infrared (NIR) light absorption and is better adjusted to absorb solar irradiance in the 1.100 nanometer to 1,800 nm range.
The solar cell is based on an absorber layer made of magnesium silicide (Mg2Si), which is an inorganic compound consisting of magnesium and silicon with an energy bandgap 1.5 eV, and is built on stainless steel (SS) substrate.
“This is the first practical demonstration of the applicability of the black magnesium silicide in solar cells,” researcher Alexander Shevlyagin told pv magazine. “In addition, we tested another concept relying on a semimetal transparent top electrode made of calcium disilicide.”
The scientists directly integrated the black silicon layers into a textured rare reflector made of an SS substrate that also served as a back electrode. Through a two-step wet-etching protocol, they covered the textured SS surface with iron oxide (Fe3O4), which they said acted as an effective diffusion barrier during silicon overgrowth.
“The resultant SS/Fe3O4/Si templates demonstrated competitive antireflection properties without needing to deposit any intermediate layers,” the scientists said.
They tested the cell under standard illumination conditions at ambient temperature. They found the device demonstrated an averaged reflection (AVR) of 15% in the spectral range of 200 nm to 1,800 nm and a power conversion efficiency of 7.5%.
“We assume the cell could beat 10 % efficiency by optimizing surface texturing of the stainless steel, for example by replacing wet chemical etching with full spectrum laser texturing,” Shevlyagin explained. “In doing so, careful optical modeling by means of finite element calculations could be very helpful.”
He said the proposed and tested concept offers a very low-cost solution for direct integration of the light-absorbing layers and textured constructive substrate.
“One of the main cost-reduction factors resulted from the implemented bottom-up approach in the production of the silicon layers on textured steel, as there are no needs in silicon wafer thinning and high silicon consumption,” he said. “In addition, our approach allows skipping the deposition of the diffusion barrier layer saving some time and resources. Finally, one can further reduce production costs by testing this idea on the battery, packaging or construction steels instead of the high-gloss steel used in the current investigation.”
The Russian team also noted the importance of using earth-abundant materials such as silicon and magnesium.
“This is why the relatively low efficiency achieved by our cell may be easily compensated by very low production costs,” said Shevlyagin.
The academics introduced the cell technology in “Textured Stainless Steel as a Platform for Black Mg2Si/Si Heterojunction Solar Cells with Advanced Photovoltaic Performance,” which was recently published in State-of-the-Art Functional Materials and Nanomaterials in Asia 2021–2022.

Germany added 640 MW of new PV capacity in August, according to the latest figures from the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur). This compares to 434.5 MW in August 2021 and 535 MW in July.
In the first eight months of 2021, developers connected 4.8 GW of solar to the grid, compared to 3.6 GW in the same period a year earlier. The country's cumulative solar capacity surpassed 60.5 GW at the end of August.
About 516 MW of the monthly new additions were represented by PV installations that were built under the country's incentive schemes for renewables. The rest of the capacity came from PV systems built outside of such incentive programs.
The Bundesnetzagentur also published new compensation rates. The fixed feed-in tariffs for rooftop systems will range between €0.086. ($0.085)/kWh and €0.113/kWh, depending on the size.

“Panasonic began sales in Europe in 2008 of its A2W Aquarea, developed based on energy-saving technology refined with its Eco Cute and air conditioners,” the company said. “Key features include its heating function which remains unchanged even in cold regions and can be used for cooling in warmer areas. Remote monitoring services are provided via the cloud.”
The heat pumps can supply domestic hot water, heating and cooling from a single, integrated unit. They are currently available with a power of 3 kW, 5 kW, 7 kW, and 9 kW for all-in-one configurations and 5 kW, 7 kW, and 9 kW for the mono-bloc variants. It can also synchronize with PV panels with Panasonic's own technology printed circuit board (PCB) technology CZ-NS4P and smart-grid compatibility.
The product features a non-flammable control box, a power box cable ground with a sealed connection, and a refrigerant separator. It also has a seasonal coefficient of performance (SPOC) rating of A+++.
According to the manufacturer, the system can be easily integrated along existing radiators, with a high water flow temperature of up to 75 C, and is able to reach up to 60 C water outlet. Furthermore, it claims the system allows a degree of flexibility in installation thanks to a piping length of up to 50m between indoor and outdoor.
“Its 598 mm x 600 mm footprint, standard size of other big appliances, facilitates the integration and an easy and neat installation in the kitchen,” said the Japanese company.
“Panasonic will invest approximately JPY 50 billion ($345.5 million) up to fiscal year ending in March 2026 to boost production and enhance technology development and marketing to meet the active demand for A2W in Europe,” the company said. “In the medium term, it will broadly expand its production capacity, aiming for a structure capable of 1 million units. Up to fiscal year ending in March 2026 the company will expand 50% of its training centers and showrooms to supply installation workers with the necessary techniques and know-how for R290 and other natural refrigerants to form a comprehensive program.”
In September, Panasonic announced a plan to increase annual production of heat pumps at its facility in Czechia to 500,000 units by March 2026. It started production of air-to-water indoor heat pumps in Plzen, Czechia, in 2018. It also launched an Internet of Things-based maintenance business in Denmark in the last fiscal year.

The facility is located in Heerhugowaard, in the province of North Holland. It features a 10 MW battery system and a 3 MW flywheel system, which are both connected to a nearby wind farm.
“The hybrid storage facility, batteries and flywheels can also support PV production facilities,” a spokesperson from ABB told pv magazine. “They can be used to curtail and smoothen the PV power profile on a short-term basis, within 15 minutes.”
The storage system has a storage capacity of around 9 MWh and relies on ABB's regenerative drives and process performance motors, which power the Kinext energy-storage flywheels developed by S4 Energy. Each Kinext unit includes a flywheel with a mass of 5,000 kg and a large diameter. The companies said it is able to spin relatively slowly, at 1,800 rpm, but it can reach a maximum speed of around 950 km per hour.
“If necessary, a Kinext unit can provide more than 1 MW of power,” said S4 Energy. “Kinext units can be used as standalone storage systems or as part of a larger set-up, in which one or more Kinext units work together with other storage technology such as battery systems.”
ABB's motor and drive use surplus power from the electricity network to speed up the rotation of the flywheel, which stores power in the form of kinetic energy and releases it back into electricity within milliseconds.
“With flywheel storage, charging and discharging is very fast. Flywheels also have a long cycle lifetime, as they do not suffer any degradation in their capacity and do not require high maintenance costs. In addition, they typically have a low environmental impact,” an ABB spokesperson said. “The levelized cost of storage (LCOS) depends on the application, but is between €0.020 ($0.020)/kWh and €0.12/kWh.”
ABB says that flywheel storage enables fast charging and discharging. Flywheels also have a long cycle lifetime, as they do not degrade and do not require high maintenance costs. In addition, they typically have a low environmental impact. S4 Energy claims its flywheel system has a cycle efficiency of more than 92% and a lifetime of over 20 years, or more than 1,000,000 cycles.
“There are similar projects in the pipeline, and other potential applications for the flywheel. For example, a flywheel peak shaving application for a harbor crane is currently being installed in the port of Rotterdam, Netherlands,” the ABB spokesperson said. “The pilot was aimed at the development of the algorithms to smoothen the wind power profile, in order to produce a profile that is similar to the forecasted production profile of the wind turbine.”
S4 Energy currently has 19 MW of storage facilities in operation and another 6 MW under construction.

The Australian state of New South Wales has officially opened its first auction for renewable energy and long- duration storage contracts. The move marks the beginning of a 10-year program which will see auctions held every six months.
New South Wales Energy Minister and Treasurer Matt Kean said the tenders, and the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap they are part of, have been designed to replace four of the state's remaining five coal power stations, which are scheduled to retire in the next 11 years. Kean has previously said that he expects all coal generators to exit the Australian market within the decade.
The first tender round, which remains open from today until Oct. 28, focuses on the Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ). The tender program is being managed by AEMO Services, which noted in an email that “early registrations have demonstrated significant interest in the tender.”
AEMO Services also said it expects “nearly all” of the 3.6 GW of projects committed or anticipated since the launch of the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap would be eligible to participate in the first tender round, suggesting a broader scope than simply the Central-West Orana REZ location.
“Many more projects have also sufficiently progressed through the development pipeline and are likely to be eligible,” said AEMO Services. “We expect this will deliver strong competition in Tender 1, and competition will only further intensify as REZ access schemes are enlivened over the course of our 10-year tender plan.”
Bidding generation projects will be required to achieve commercial operation by January 2025, while long-duration storage projects have until the beginning of 2027. The tender pack also includes stipulations about community engagement and benefits, regional jobs and land use considerations.
Successful projects will be able to participate in the state’s “Long-Term Energy Service Agreements” scheme – a mechanism for the government to underwrite projects and provide financial security.
AEMO Services previously said the desired size of the round one tender would be 2,500 GWh for annual renewable generation and 600 MW of long-duration storage, although it noted at the time that generation and storage will be considered if it is “in the long-term financial interests of NSW electricity consumers to do so.
The NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap is expected to attract AUD 32 billion ($20.9 billion) in private capital and is an enormous undertaking, balancing the massive energy demands of the most populace state with a dramatic U-turn away from coal dependency towards integrated renewables in a tight timeframe.
The New South Wales roadmap largely hinges on the establishment of five renewable energy zones: Central-West Orana, New England, Illawarra, Hunter-Central Coast, and South-West.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/10/04/how-long-do-residential-energy-storage-batteries-last/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 4, 2022",How long do residential energy storage batteries last?,"From pv magazine USA
In the first two parts of this series, pv magazine reviewed the productive lifespan of residential solar panels and inverters. Now, we examine home batteries, how well they perform over time, and how long they last.
Residential energy storage has become an increasingly popular feature of home solar. A recent SunPower survey of more than 1,500 households found that about 40% of Americans worry about power outages on a regular basis. Of the survey respondents actively considering solar for their homes, 70% said they planned to include a battery energy storage system.
Besides providing backup power during outages, many batteries are integrated with technology that allows for intelligent scheduling of the import and export of energy. The idea here is to maximize the value of the home’s solar system. And, some batteries are optimized to integrate an electric vehicle charger.
Although deployment of energy storage is on a steady climb, attachment rates of batteries remain low. In 2020, 8.1% of residential solar systems attached batteries, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL).
Many options exist with multiple battery chemistries available for home energy storage. But the bottom line is that in the United States, two brands dominate the space. More than 90% of the market is served by LG Chem and Tesla Powerwall, which are lithium-ion batteries, according to LBL. Tesla has more than 60% of the entire market share.
The Tesla PowerWall has a limited warranty that says the device will be free from defects for 10 years following installation. It also warrants that the PowerWall will start its life with a capacity of 13.5 kWh, and will retain energy capacity based on a degradation schedule.
LG says that its system will retain at least 60% of its nominal energy capacity (9.8 kWh) for 10 years. The battery must operate between -10 C and 45 C to remain covered by warranty. Total throughput of energy within the warranty is limited to 27.4 MWh.
Battery life
Solar installer Sunrun said batteries can last anywhere between five to 15 years. That means a replacement likely will be needed during the 20 to 30 year life of a solar system.
Battery life expectancy is mostly driven by usage cycles. As demonstrated by the LG and Tesla product warranties, thresholds of 60% or 70% capacity are warranted through a certain number of charge cycles.
Two use-scenarios drive this degradation: over charge and trickle charge, said the Faraday Institution. Overcharge is the act of pushing current into a battery that is fully charged. Doing this can cause it to overheat, or even potentially catch fire.
Trickle charge involves a process in which the battery is continually charged up to 100%, and inevitably losses take place. The bounce between 100% and just under 100% can elevate internal temperatures, diminishing capacity and lifetime.
Another cause of degradation over time is the loss of mobile lithium-ions in the battery, said Faraday. Side reactions in the battery can trap free usable lithium, thereby lowering capacity gradually.
While cold temperatures can halt a lithium-ion battery from performing, they do not actually degrade the battery or shorten its effective life. Overall battery lifetime is, however, diminished at high temperatures, said Faraday. This is because the electrolyte that sits between the electrodes breaks down at elevated temperatures, causing the battery to lose its capacity for Li-ion shuttling. This can reduce the number of Li-ions the electrode can accept into its structure, depleting the lithium-ion battery capacity.
Maintenance matters
It is recommended by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to install a battery in a cool, dry place, preferably a garage, where the impact of a fire (a small, but non-zero threat) may be minimized. Batteries and components around them should have proper spacing to allow cooling, and regular maintenance check-ups can be helpful in ensuring optimal operation.
NREL said that whenever possible, avoid repeated deep discharging of batteries, as the more it is discharged, the shorter the lifetime. If the home battery is discharged deeply every day, it may be time to increase the battery bank’s size.
Batteries in series should be kept at the same charge, said NREL. Though the entire battery bank may display an overall charge of 24 volts, there can be varied voltage among the batteries, which is less beneficial to protecting the entire system over the long run. Additionally, NREL recommended that the correct voltage set points are set for chargers and charge controllers, as determined by the manufacturer.
Inspections should occur frequently, too, said NREL. Some things to look for include leakage (buildup on the outside of the battery), appropriate fluid levels, and equal voltage. NREL said each battery manufacturer may have additional recommendations, so checking maintenance and data sheets on a battery is a best practice.
