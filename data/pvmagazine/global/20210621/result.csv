France-based start-up Energiestro has developed a storage technology for residential PV based on a flywheel system based on concrete.
A flywheel system is able to store electricity by converting it into kinetic energy using a motor to spin a rotor. The flywheel rotates at such a high speed that the electrical power is transformed into mechanical power.
The proposed solution consists of a hollow or solid cylinder that is rotated around an axis and connected to an electric motor and generator. “When you have the energy to store, the engine drives the flywheel, which accelerates,” said the company's co-founder and general director, André Gennesseaux. “In the other direction, the motor can act as a brake to discharge the electricity.”
To date, according to the manufacturer, most of the flywheels used for this kind of storage were made of steel. “But steel flywheels have a limit: their price, while stationary storage users are looking, above all, for the best costs,” Gennesseaux explained. “Some companies are also developing carbon cylinders, which are much lighter but, again, very expensive while our approach is not to work primarily on the weight because in this type of applications, it does not matter.”
According to the general director, carbon flywheels currently cost around €250/kWh, steel flywheels €200/kWh and concrete ones around a few euros. “The particularity of our patented technology is that the concrete cylinder is pre-stressed by a winding of fiberglass and is held in a vacuum to avoid friction,” Gennesseaux stated. Thanks to this, maintenance operations are reduced because the mechanical part is sealed and the lubricating oil is also in a vacuum environment, without risk of oxidation.
The flywheel is guaranteed for 30 years and a change of its inverter is expected after 15 years. “At the beginning, we chose concrete for price reasons, but we quickly found that its life cycle analysis was also positive,” Gennesseaux went on to say. “We are around 10 grams of CO2 per kWh, while lithium-ion batteries are around 40g CO2/kWh, at the same level as steel flywheels.”
Currently, Energiestro offers a standard storage solution with a nominal power of around 10 kW, which corresponds to a charge and discharge cycle in one hour.
The flywheel has a diameter of one metre and weighs three tonnes, and can be placed in the garden of a private house.
The system capacity should be increased, initially, to 20 kWh, and then 50 kWh, to eventually reach 24 hours of storage. “The size limit will be given by logistics as we have to find cranes capable of burying the flywheels in the ground, which is why we are limiting ourselves to 50 kWh in our current business plan,” Gennesseaux added, noting that the solution will be initially offered in France's overseas territories and Africa.
The French company received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program. “As a beta-test, we have a demonstration project with Voltalia in Guyana,” Gennesseaux said. “In this context, we will install a 10 kWh flywheel which will manage fluctuations on the network for one hour if a cloud passes.”
According to him, in hot and humid regions, the flywheels are much more robust and reliable than lithium-ion batteries. The company is also working in partnership with Engie on the Thémis solar power plant project in the Pyrénées-Orientales (3.4 MWp) where several 10 kWh flywheels will be installed with the objective of verifying the effect of this technology in frequency regulation, compared to lithium-ion batteries.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/21/the-case-for-microinverters-in-indian-rooftop-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INVERTERS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 21, 2021",The case for microinverters in Indian rooftop solar,"From pv magazine India
pv magazine: The slow uptake of rooftop solar in India is itself a challenge to solution providers. Why has rooftop solar not taken off in a big way in India?
Sunil Thamaran: The number one issue that we have seen in India is the change in policy from time to time and the lack of awareness about the changes. For example, earlier, we had a net metering policy. Now we have a gross metering policy. Changes have been proposed back and forth at various times in different states. And when this happens, training and awareness are lacking at the implementer level, like Discoms or even the installer.
To give you an example, in Bengaluru, we faced many challenges when we went to rural areas. We had to get the Discom involved, giving them advice or sharing experiences to make sure that they understood what they were doing and approved the systems.
The second issue is lack of finance as solar is a very capital-intensive market. The unavailability of finance at a lower interest rate has been a problem for the customers.
Lastly, a majority of the rooftop market is actually supplied by low-cost players who cannot provide long-term reliability. It’s been either a five-year warranty or a maximum of 10 years for inverters. That causes a problem as customers need to factor in the replacement costs for a product.
pv magazine: Inverters play a crucial role in the performance of a solar installation. What are the inverter solutions available for rooftop solar? 
There are typically two types of inverters being used for rooftop installations. String inverters capture a majority of the market. In string inverters, many panels get connected in a string on the roof, and this string is then connected to an inverter box, a large box placed somewhere in the building.
The other solution that we do is module-level power electronics (MPLE), which is what the microinverters or the power optimizers stand for. Here an inverter is connected right behind every panel, and then at that roof level, the outputs from all these inverters are combined in one cable that comes down to the meter box. That way, microinverters are safe to use as DC-AC conversion happens on the panel level, and there is no high-voltage power traveling through your system.
pv magazine: How do microinverters compare with string inverters in terms of performance? How do the rooftop size and shading affect the inverter selection?
The inverter selection depends on the overall generation and the total cost of ownership, or energy cost.
Talking about the parameters, the first thing that people should look at is the system’s generation efficiency. Typically, string inverters are efficient anywhere from 95% onwards. There are some which are 96 or 97% efficient. So they all play around at that level.
On the other hand, microinverters offer 98% and above efficiency. To explain to you, it’s a ‘one inverter, one panel’ solution. That means, for a building with 10 panels, you will have 10 inverters. So, if one inverter goes down for some reason, the other nine will continue to work, and you will still have power in the building. In other words, it is not the complete power loss with microinverters.
On the other hand, with string inverters, there will be one inverter for all 10 panels. So if that inverter failed, the entire system is down until you replace or repair the inverter.
Further, as each panel has an inverter connected to it, the conversion is optimized at the panel level. This maximizes the overall conversion efficiency. We could say microinverters will be more efficient even if there was an issue with some panels.
This is where the shadow element comes into the picture.
In a system using string inverters, even if one panel has some issue like shadow, dust, or bird dropping, it will limit the performance of the entire string. On the other hand, with microinverter, only the panels under the shading will produce less, and the rest will continue to produce at a high level.
Microinverters don’t just pay off in the first or second year as they are priced more, but their overall benefits in 20 years will be much greater than with string inverters.
The installation is pretty simple. The microinverter is a very small device, weighing just about 1 kg. It’s a plug-and-play kind of system where the cable plugs in like a USB, and there are not many screws.
pv magazine: You talked about panel failure and the resultant impact on performance with microinverters and string inverters. How is the failure of microinverters themselves taken care of?
In India, you can buy a warranty of up to 25 years for Enphase microinverters.
We have a continuous monitoring system that is available on the mobile app and also on the web. Each inverter communicates to the cloud through the Internet of Things (IoT). So every customer, including the service provider, can log in and access. We provide login access to the customer and also the service provider. We can monitor every system on the field from our office.
pv magazine: There are not many players in microinverters. What’s the main reason?
Enphase is leading microinverter solutions today in the world. In the US market, we have close to a 50% market share. But there have been small players coming in from China. I would say the number one reason is the ability to provide a long-term warranty for 25 years, given microinverters are a costly solution. It requires a lot of engineering, a lot of quality-conscious design to provide that kind of a solution.
pv magazine: What are the microinverter companies’ main challenges in design, and what are they working on? 
One obviously is the price, as every customer will compare the [microinverter] price with the string inverters. That is a huge challenge for us as microinverters are priced two to three times more.
The second challenge is being able to catch up with the module technology roadmap. Solar panels continue to evolve, from 400 W to 500 W, and now even higher outputs. We have to improve the performance or mechanism of our microinverters accordingly so that they can be paired with the higher-wattage panels. That means, in general, design has to change, the power output has to change, and so on. But that is only one vector that we are driving.
We are investing heavily in enabling microinverters for high-wattage panels. We are coming up with the IQ8 inverter, which can be paired with 450-500W panels.
In terms of application areas, the residential rooftop sector is the primary focus as the microinverter is a small system. But one adjacent market is the small commercial segment. For commercial sector applications, the cost difference will be huge when using microinverters. We are addressing that challenge by coming out with a dual solution to pair two panels with one inverter. That will reduce the per-watt price as one can pair, say, two 400 W panels or address the requirement for 800 W with one device.
pv magazine: What are your India plans?
We are manufacturing microinverters from India too. We have three manufacturing plants globally, one in China, the second in Mexico, and the third in Chennai, India. Our India plant can ramp up to 1 million units per quarter, but we have done about 400,000 units per quarter. It started operating in October last year. It is an export unit from where the units are shipped to the US market. We are also applying for the BIS certification. Once that is satisfied, we will be able to supply to the Indian market as well.

The battery cell pilot plant that Phi4tech is building in the Noblejas municipality, in the province of Toledo, in Spain's central region of Castilla-La Mancha, will be operational this year.
The company had announced the project for the manufacturing facility in March, in a joint statement with the regional government of Extremadura, where lithium for the factory will be extracted at the Las Navas mine, starting from early 2023.
The facility is expected to begin battery cell production, with an initial capacity of 300 MWh, by the end of this year. Its capacity is planned to be scaled up to 2 GWh in 2023, 10 GWh in 2025 and, eventually, 20 GWh in 2027.
The cathodes for the battery cells will be manufactured at another manufacturing facility currently under development in the province of Cáceres, which is also located in Extremadura.
The construction of the two factories will require an aggregate investment of around €1 billion and will help create more than 1,600 direct jobs.

Telangana-based solar manufacturer and engineering, procurement and construction services contractor Premier Energies has started trial production of high-efficiency solar cells at its new factory in Telangana.
The facility, at Electronic City near Hyderabad’s airport, is an INR483 crore ($65 million), 25-acre greenfield project. It has an annual cell and module production capacity of 750 MW.
The manufacturing unit can produce 19.2%-efficient multi-crystalline cells using metal-catalyzed chemical etching (MCCE), textured black silicon and can also manufacture 22.5%-efficient mono PERC cells. The products are based on 158.75×158.75mm silicon wafers but the factory is also equipped to process 182mm and 210mm-wafer-based cells.
Chiranjeev Saluja, founder and managing director of Premier Energies, said: “As more technologies emerge and the existing technologies evolve to meet market demands, our R&D efforts are focused on continuously innovating to introduce the highest efficiency and [most] reliable products, with an unwavering focus on a higher return on investments for our customers. With the commencement of production, we have further strengthened our product portfolio, which caters to a wide range of customers.” 
Formal inauguration of the plant is expected next month, if the Covid-19 situation eases.
“The ISO 9001 [and] ISO 14001-certified manufacturing facility uses state-of-the-art production systems such as TQC (total quality control) and SPC (statistical process control) quality control,” said Premier Energies. “This launch will, therefore, increase the availability of highest-quality, made-in-India solar cells and contribute to the government’s atmanirbhar Bharat initiatives.”
Premier Energies is one of India’s leading solar cell and module manufacturers and says it provides end-to-end solar power solutions to organizations in more than 30 countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia.

Junior power minister Nasrul Hamid made the declaration yesterday, at an inauguration ceremony for Bangladesh's largest solar rooftop, a $16 million, 16 MW array in Chittagong. The government in March said it would reformulate its renewables policy after it fell well short of a target to generate 10% of its electricity from clean power by last year. Around 3% of Bangladesh's power came from clean sources at that point.
“Renewable energy will be the main source of energy in the future,” the minister said on Sunday, emphasizing the benefits offered by commercial solar rooftops. “The share of renewable energy is increasing in [the] fuel mix,” said Hamid, in part thanks to the rising popularity of net-metered solar arrays like the one installed at an export processing zone owned by Korean clothing and textiles company Youngone Corporation. Export processing zones are areas with less onerous customs and tax charges where manufacturing takes place solely for export.
The minister said plans to expand the Chittagong array to 40 MW next year would encourage other businesses to follow suit.
The politician stressed, however, that the big land requirements of large scale, ground-mounted solar plants would mean wind, tidal and energy-from-waste facilities would also have big roles to play in reaching the government's 2041 target.
Youngone Corporation intends to expand its Chittagong project to around 40 MW of generation capacity, with 4.3 MW due to come online before November and the balance expected next year.
The intention is for all 34 factories at the Youngone export processing zone to be powered entirely by the eventual 40 MW of solar capacity. With the rooftop array net-metered, any excess power generated will be exported to the grid.
Lee Jang-Keun, South Korean ambassador to Bangladesh, said of the rooftop array: “This is how businesses can get along with nature and reduce the threat of climate change.”
Bangladesh has around 746 MW of renewable energy generation capacity and the first stage of the Chittagong array has taken the nation to 40.72 MW of net-metered rooftop solar.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/21/carbon-neutrality-and-solars-role-in-asean-nations/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,ASIA,PHILIPPINES,THAILAND",,"JUNE 21, 2021",Carbon neutrality and solar’s role in ASEAN nations,"A key milestone has recently been made by Indonesia, the fourth largest coal producer in the world, which announced the cessation of new-build coal power plants from 2023. This announcement is an encouraging sign that sustainable development and growth are underway in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and that countries should collectively build on the momentum in driving the low-carbon transition sooner.
From boardrooms to courtrooms around the world, we have witnessed an increased pace along the sustainability pathway. ASEAN can accelerate its transition towards a sustainable global economy through a combination of positive policies, mechanisms, and stakeholders’ responses that include net-zero goals, carbon markets, smart urbanization, sustainable funding, and resource optimization.
According to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), energy demand in Southeast Asia will grow by 60% over the next two decades. The power sector will be responsible for just under half of the region’s carbon dioxide emissions in 2040, up from 42% in 2019.
Climate change is a huge concern for ASEAN as the Philippines, Myanmar, and Vietnam are ranked in the top 10 globally in terms of how badly they will be affected by climate change. In many ASEAN nations, rising sea-levels pose worrisome threats to low-lying coastal cities, and extensive agricultural lands are at risk of floods.
To propel the growth trajectory of green efforts, ASEAN should commit to net-zero and carbon neutrality goals sooner. With carbon neutrality having an effect on de-risking and enhancing the competitiveness of businesses, this will increase attractiveness for foreign direct investments and promote the growth of green finance.
While goals and appropriate mechanisms must be set, the pathway towards carbon neutrality will require efforts from a range of stakeholders – governments, companies, and the community.
An immediate quick win of energy transition is the harnessing of solar power from an abundance of resources in the region. Governments in ASEAN have prioritized solar power as the alternative fuel to displace fossil fuel in recent power development plans. In particular, rooftop solar power and other distributed power resources have its merits of providing energy resilience in the community, limiting energy transmission loss, and overcoming the broader challenge of integrating more renewable energy to support the pathway towards carbon neutrality.
Rooftop solar power is cost competitive in serving concentrated demand across cities and industrial parks in ASEAN, as well as demand in remote areas. Adequate regulatory policies and incentives including net-metering will be required to encourage supply from producers and prosumers to step up on rooftop solar panel deployment, and potentially promote behavioral changes to conserve energy, thereby feeding excess power back to the grid.
To further optimize the integration of renewable energy, governments should encourage investments in other supporting energy solutions, such as utility-scale or behind-the-meter energy storage.
Navigating the carbon neutrality route will require ASEAN to develop a concerted carbon market, starting with the implementation of carbon taxes and mechanisms to support a net-zero pathway.
In ASEAN, the carbon market is in its early stages, with only Singapore having an economy-wide carbon tax implemented. Vietnam recently passed the revised Law on Environmental Protection that will legalize an emission trading scheme, taking effect on January 1, 2022. Other ASEAN nations are also gravitating towards the same direction – Thailand is considering enacting a carbon market, and Indonesia has drawn up proposals for the implementation of carbon tax.
In Europe, carbon prices have more than doubled from a year ago as carbon emission regulations continue to tighten. Drawing this as a reference point for ASEAN, increased pressure on corporates to make green commitments and transparency in reporting can further ensure efficiency in the carbon market.
As ASEAN urbanizes, governments should implement the concept of smart city development to optimize outcomes – limiting carbon footprints through the efficient use of resources. Sustainability has become a key feature of urbanization and masterplans for ASEAN’s major cities, incorporating features such as green spaces, renewable energy, smart energy management, and district cooling.
For instance, Thailand’s smart cities masterplan aims to address the high cost of energy by transitioning towards incorporating renewable energy into the supply, while implementing policies to reduce and reuse waste, as well as deploying other smart solutions like smart grids, district cooling systems, and promoting co-generation facilities.
Countries should also adopt smart technologies such as Internet of Things, mobile devices, artificial intelligence, and sensors that can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of solving day-to-day issues like traffic management and tracking carbon emissions. ASEAN countries can mitigate environmental risks by deploying such technologies to capture and analyze real-time data, while simulating scenarios to optimize solutions.
With the establishment of ASEAN Smart Cities Network in 2018, 26 pilot smart cities have been identified, with the objective to improve overall quality of lives through smart and sustainable urban development that is enabled by technology.
Since then, major ASEAN countries have made ambitious development plans: Thailand aims to achieve 100 smart cities by 2024; and Indonesia aims for 100 smart cities in its masterplan. These encouraging smart city trends should continue to expand and encompass sustainability as ASEAN strives to accelerate its economic growth.
According to the Asian Development Bank, for Asia to maintain growth momentum and eradicate poverty while responding to climate change, the region must invest US$1.7 trillion a year in infrastructure through 2030. However, only about 2% (US$40 billion) is expected to be allocated to climate risk adaptation. As Covid-19 puts a further strain on public finances, there are opportunities for public-private partnerships and private investments to drive sustainable development projects.
One encouraging sign is the rise of corporate power purchase agreements (PPA) for renewable energy in ASEAN. In Singapore, Sunseap Group signed PPAs with tech giants such as Facebook and Amazon, to supply 100% renewable energy to power operations in this region.
Non-ASEAN power players have also penetrated the ASEAN market to serve the growing renewable energy demand. Japanese renewable energy startup, Shizen Energy, in partnership with Constant Energy, signed corporate PPAs with Japanese companies operating in Southeast Asia, for example.
As more corporations commit to sustainability and net-zero goals, corporate PPAs and renewable energy investments will continue to grow, which are essential in meeting future carbon neutrality pledges for ASEAN countries.
Notably, a collective initiative from global organizations such as RE100 encourages more commitments to 100% renewable energy and incorporation of low-carbon solutions across supply and value chains. Given the demands to reducing scope 3 emission, which is all indirect emissions in a company’s value chain, these suppliers will be required to comply and make the transition towards carbon neutrality.
Finally, the involvement of local communities to engage in the activities of “Reduce, Re-use and Re-cycle” is essential. Consumer behavior towards the efficient use of resources and utilization of energy-efficiency technologies can be cultivated. This is seen from a slew of ASEAN programs that encourage switching out of old electric appliances and equipment that are not energy efficient.
The culture of reusable packaging has also been promoted in Singapore and Malaysia in recent years and discouraging the use of single-use plastics will help reduce carbon footprints and lighten the burden of waste management.
Recycling remains challenging in ASEAN as municipal waste collection and management remain the top concern for waste-to-energy projects, but this will likely improve as more public awareness and educational efforts are being carried out.
The road towards carbon neutrality is one that requires immediate efforts from a multitude of stakeholders utilizing a broad range of solutions. An ASEAN carbon neutral pathway presents many opportunities for governments, businesses, and consumers to make strategic choices that will ensure economic relevance in years to come, as the changing tides of a greener world will become inevitable.

Australia’s and perhaps the world’s largest green energy and hydrogen project, the 26 GW, $50 billion Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) slated for the Pilbara region of Western Australia was last year granted Major Project Status by the Commonwealth government; last week it was stamped by the same government as “clearly unacceptable” on the grounds that it impacts wetlands near Eighty Mile Beach, which are designated as having international significance under the 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.
Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley rejected the latest plans proposed for AREH — which shifted required infrastructure to suit production and export of green hydrogen and ammonia, rather than the original plan which mooted export of most of the project’s prodigious electricity output via underwater cable to Asia — on the grounds that they would pose a risk to threatened bird species that inhabit the wetlands.
The minister found that “the marine component of the infrastructure corridor would disrupt tidal movement and processes, and this would seriously impact the habitats and life-cycle of the native species dependent on the wetland,” a ministerial spokesperson said.
AREH consortium members include Intercontinental Energy (one of the world’s biggest green hydrogen developers); renewable energy developer CWP Global; Vestas wind-turbine system manufacturers; the Nyangumarta traditional owners; and the Australian National University’s Energy Change Institute.
In response to last week’s rejection, the group issued a statement saying, “We will take concerns on board as we continue to work on the detailed design and engineering aspects of the project.”
In October 2020 AREH was deemed to dovetail with the federal government’s Technology Investment Road map, which highlights hydrogen (renewable or fossil-fuel derived) development as an investment priority.
The government’s decision comes at a time when its coalition is under pressure from leadership ructions in the National Party, which coalesced late last week into virulent rejection of a pending federal government commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050.
This morning those ructions turned into a spill that reinstates anti-net zero emissions populist Barnaby Joyce as head of the Nationals, and as deputy prime minister.
Ley’s decision predates today’s demonstration of the Nationals’ discontent, but seems to have caught other supporters of the AREH project unawares.
Allanah MacTiernan, the Western Australian minister for regional development and the hydrogen industry, said, “We’re very surprised at how quickly the decision was met, and it appears that there wasn’t a lot of discussion with the proponent.”
She also suggested that coal-based hydrogen projects, which often have significant environmental impacts related to emissions, have easily negotiated federal government approval.
Development of the AREH proposal began in 2014, and Lead Agency Status was granted by the Western Australian government in 2018, followed by the Federal Major Project Status conferral last year.
“Major Status” assumes fast-tracking — though not sidelining of environmental and other responsibilities — of the project in anticipation of the benefits it will bring to a region, or to the country as a whole.
A land parcel of 6,500 square kilometres has been secured for the combined wind and solar generation of the AREH through the Western Australian Department of Lands, and the project was identified as a major diversifier of the Pilbara economy, generating some 20,000 jobs during its 10 years of staged construction, and thousands of permanent jobs as operations come on line from 2027.
Some 3 GW of output from the vast project are earmarked for large energy users in the Pilbara region which may include new or expanded mines and downstream processing of minerals, enabling a value-added component to Australia’s export of resources.
The Western Australian government approved the first 15 GW stage of the AREH, in 2018, based on the recommendation of the state’s Environmental Protection Authority.
Back in 2017, the Australian Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment had also conditionally approved AREH’s then proposal.
The conditions related to several impacts, on terrestrial, marine and wetland habitat, but with regard to wetlands in particular, included: “To avoid and mitigate the impacts of infrastructure on threatened shorebirds and migratory birds the approval holder must: space wind turbines such that individual turbines in each row are separated by at least 800m and each row is separated at least four kilometres from the next row” and that the proponent should “not undertake construction or cable installation activities within the Eighty Mile Beach Ramsar Site boundary during peak migration periods for threatened shorebirds and migratory birds (1 October through to 31 March in any year)”.
AREH plans, more recently amended towards large-scale export of green ammonia, are understood to include development of pipelines to transport ammonia and the construction of a new town between Broome and Port Hedland to house workers.
With limited detail available, it is hard to fully understand how the project now warrants a decision that declares it “unacceptable” and therefore unapproved.
The Clean Energy Council (CEC) released a statement this morning saying it understands, “that the Federal Minister for the Environment has rejected the expanded proposal for this project prior to the completion of detailed environmental studies”.
The renewable energy industry body is now “seeking urgent clarification” and for Ley to “address the perception that this decision is inconsistent with well-established processes or with the treatment of non-renewable projects”.
In a report by ABC News this morning, MacTiernan said, “We need to be very clear about where the government stands with hydrogen.”
She, too, alluded to the approvals of “quite controversial coal projects” in the push to develop hydrogen of any hue.
She added, “Everyone, theoretically, has signed on to the notion that we will be ultimately replacing our natural gas exports with hydrogen exports. We’re going to need to work cooperatively to find a way in which this can be done.”
Asked by the ABC to comment on the rejection of AREH’s proposal this morning Professor Andrew Blakers from the ANU’s Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions emphasised the importance of locating and building renewable energy projects to high environmental standards, but added that he would like to see “all mine sites in the future” run “primarily from solar and/or wind”.
In the light of AREH’s potential to enable such ambitions for Australian minerals extraction, he hoped the project would be able to work around the issues raised by the federal government approval process.
“Firm adherence to guidelines means most of the potential environmental downsides will already have been thought out and ameliorated,” he said.
In its statement, the CEC says it expects the Commonwealth to work in partnership with the AREH consortium and “provide the necessary guidance to appropriately assess and address any environmental impact” of the project under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.
It describes the AREH as “a transformative economic opportunity for Australia, making a significant contribution to local and global decarbonisation efforts.”
Has decarbonisation been taken off the National agenda as the government heads towards an election with the emissions-breathing Nationals in tow?

The Chinese manufacturers will each hand over RMB315 million (US$48.8 million) for a 9% stake in the Inner Mongolia Xinte unit of TBEA-owned poly manufacturer Xinte Energy. With the parent company injecting a further RMB2.81 billion (US$435 million), the subsidiary's registered capital will rise from RMB60 million (US$9.29 million) to RMB3.5 billion (US$542 million), provided Xinte Energy shareholders approve the plan.
An update issued by Xinte to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Friday revealed the manufacturing facility will, in return for the investment, “prioritize the supply of polysilicon to the investors,” with a poly supply deal due to be drawn up by July 18.
Under the planned investment, Jinko and JA Solar will have the right to demand Xinte repurchase their 9% stakes if the manufacturing plant produces less than 50,000 tons of polysilicon per year in successive years. Xinte said such a development would cost it no more than RMB857 million (US$133 million).
Xinte said details of when and where the shareholder vote on the proposed tie-up will take place will be published by August 6.

Interested developers will have time until August 19 to pre-qualify for the tender.
Namibia had around 145 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2020, according to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency. No new PV capacity was deployed in the country in the past year.
Namibia’s state-owned electric utility, NamPower, is aiming to install 220 MW of renewables capacity, including 40 MW of solar.
In 2019, the World Economic Forum’s global future council on energy revealed, the governments of Namibia and Botswana had started discussing a plan to develop 5 GW of solar capacity over the next two decades.

The development emerged after the Ukrainian ministry responded to questions asked by member of parliament Liudmyla Buimister, a member of the nation's ruling Sluha Narodu (Servant of the People) party.
Lithuanian renewables company Modus Energy International BV has lodged an €11.5 million claim against the government of Ukraine after the state reduced clean energy payments by between 2.5% and 15%, from August, to ease financial demands on the public purse.
The latest edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT solar, co-location for green hydrogen production, price movements amid the polysilicon shortage, and the trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
Modus – which Russian news agency Interfax has previously reported was among renewables companies in Ukraine which did not sign up to the FITs proposal – claims the reduction in payments breaches its rights under the Energy Charter Treaty international agreement to which Ukraine and Lithuania are both signatories.
The case is due to be heard at the Stockholm business group but the Ministry of Justice told MP Buimister it is challenging that tribunal's jurisdiction to hear the case. A copy of the ministry's response was published by the MP on her Facebook page and pv magazine has seen sections of the reply which were translated by London-based legal and tax consultancy CMS Cameron McKenna Nabarro Olswang LLP.
The ministry response anticipates detailed legal claims and responses in the case will emerge next year and has asked for oversight of all official statements made by Ukrainian officials which relate to the case, in part “to prevent the state budget from suffering losses as a result of losing investment disputes.” The letter continues: “This is especially important now, as the said case is the first one in the ‘green energy' sector and any positive or negative experience may affect arbitration in respect of the future, similar disputes and cases against Ukraine.”
CMS has previously referred to the minutes of a Ukrainian government cabinet meeting which indicated Modus' claim relates to three solar plants in the country with a total generation capacity of 47 MW. The London firm said the renewables business had been hit by the maximum reduction in FIT payments of 15%, which will affect income which had been contractually guaranteed until 2029.
MP Buimister is experienced in legal and industrial matters and in ensuring Ukrainian legislation complies with international agreements. With experience in the wind power sector, she is a member of the Ukrainian parliament's economic development committee and head of its sub-committee for competition policy.
This copy was amended on 24/06/21 after the lawyer representing Modus in the case confirmed the estimated damages concerned are €11.5 million.

These storage systems have a combined capacity of 189.5 MW and a maximum storage capacity of 295.6 MWh. This compares to 115.9 MW/186.3 MWh of distributed storage capacity at the end of December 2019.
With the exception of one standalone system, all the deployed batteries have a capacity of up to 10 kW. Around 96% of the installed storage capacity is represented by systems based on lithium-ion technology. The figures show around 99% of the devices have a storage capacity of less than 20 kWh.
Most of the storage systems are deployed in the region of Lombardy – some 12,169 units with a combined capacity of 51.8 MW/85.4 MWh. The regional government is implementing a multi-year rebate scheme for residential and commercial storage systems coupled with PV. The scheme is open to two different kinds of projects – installations of PV systems linked to storage systems, and the deployment of standalone storage systems linked to existing solar arrays. For the first project category, the rebates cover 50% of purchase and installation costs. This percentage could go up to 90% for projects developed by small municipalities.
The Veneto region, which is also supporting distributed storage deployment through an ad hoc scheme, has the second-largest volume of storage capacity, at 30.4 MW/51.4 MWh.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/21/black-perovskite-solar-cell-with-15-efficiency-via-thermal-evaporation/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 21, 2021",Black perovskite solar cell with 15% efficiency via thermal evaporation,"Researchers at the Dresden University of Technology (TUD) have fabricated a solar cell based on all-inorganic cesium-lead iodide (CsPbI3) perovskite, which is also known as black perovskite.
“Our choice to study the CsPbI3 was motivated by the fact that it shows superior stability as compared to the commonly used organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites,” TUD researcher Yana Vaynzof told pv magazine. “Considering that stability is one of the key challenges preventing perovskite photovoltaics from being widely applied in industrial applications, we chose to focus on the most promising and stable perovskite composition.”
The German group decided to deposit the perovskite layers onto the cell by thermal evaporation, a technique it describes as having many advantages in terms of both economic and environmental aspects. “First of all, thermal evaporation is a well-established fabrication method in industrial settings, suggesting that evaporation of perovskite solar cells can be easily performed using existing facilities in the industry without the need for further investment,” Vaynzof explained. “Secondly, deposition by thermal evaporation is easily scalable — this stands in contrast to the common deposition of perovskite solar cells by solution processing, which is mostly optimized for small area devices only.” Lastly, thermal evaporation is a solvent-free deposition method that has additional benefits in terms of lowering costs and due to the fact that such solvents are toxic to humans and the environment.
Lead(II) iodide (PbI2) and cesium iodide (CsI) were co-evaporated at a low temperature of 100 degrees Celsius with a small amount of phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI), which is an ammonium salt used to improve stability and optoelectronic quality in perovskite cells. “The PEAI containing thermally evaporated γ-CsPbI3 perovskite films exhibit a far better film microstructure and a preferential crystal orientation,” the scientists stated, noting that this results in a substantial decrease in defect density.
The solar cell showed a power conversion efficiency of 15% and an open-circuit voltage of 1.1 V. “Moreover, this performance surpasses that reported for solution-processed PEAI containing γ-CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on the same composition, illustrating that thermally evaporated PSCs can compete and even outperform most PSCs deposited from solution,” the researchers further explained.
The cell was also able to retain around 90% of its initial performance after 215 days of exposure to dim light at room temperature. “The development of efficient and stable thermally evaporated solar cells is of key importance to their future integration into industrial applications,” Vaynzof emphasized. “Due to the low temperature of processing (<100C), these devices can also be deposited on flexible substrates and thus find a broad range of applications for renewable energy generation.”
The details on the novel evaporation process can be found in the paper “Efficient Thermally Evaporated γ-CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells,” published in Advanced Energy Materials.
The research on black perovskite has seen increasing interest in recent years. In March, an international research team led by the Soochow University in China developed a 15.1%-efficient flexible quantum dot solar cell based on CsPbI3. The researchers built the cell by integrating quantum dots (QDs) with high surface areas into a thin hybrid interfacial architecture (HIA) and by adding phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), which is one of the best-performing electron acceptors commonly used in organic photovoltaic devices, into the CsPbI3 quantum dot layer.
Another interesting research project was conducted in 2019 to uncover the secrets of black perovskite. According to the study, which involved scientists at 11 research centers on three continents, the interface between perovskite and substrate that is formed during annealing at high temperature remains even after a return to ambient temperature. If the temperature drop is quite steep, perovskite can retain the crystal mesh of the interface and adapt to it.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/21/solar-101-it-all-comes-down-to-curb-appeal/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 21, 2021",Solar 101: It all comes down to curb appeal,"From pv magazine USA
When it comes to buying residential solar panels in the United States, the most important factor is curb appeal.
U.S. home equity collectively represents the largest savings account in the country. And because aesthetics are among the most important factors in determining the value of a home, America’s residential solar consumers tend to get a bit, well, persnickety.
So what is it, exactly, that makes a solar panel attractive? At pv magazine USA we believe that all solar panels are beautiful. But we are aware that grumpy neighbors and local HOAs have opinions, too.
The residential solar industry has taken notice of the demand for beautiful, hidden panels, and is now exploring techniques to provide creative and attractive designs.
Tesla answered the call by designing a new roofing product – Solar Glass – to hold the solar cells. This product is drop-dead gorgeous, though, sadly, it seems to have been made from unobtanium. So far, Tesla has been struggling to deliver these roofs on time, and growing pains have resulted in startling price increases.
Other manufacturers are experimenting with the “solar shingle” form factor, including Luma Solar and Certainteed. These groups are seeking to replace the standard asphalt shingle with a shingle that contains a solar panel.
GAF Energy is installing a standard solar panel, but adding refinements to smooth the hard edges, and replacing the shingles, but not other roofing material layers. In mid-June, the company said it had finished work on its largest-ever residential solar roofing system, a 31 kW system in California that is expected to produce 50,455 kWh of energy annually.
In Europe, Viridian Solar panels attach flush to the roof, completely replacing roofing material. Sadly, these clever panels are not yet available in the U.S. And for now, nearly all of these designer panels are still niche products.
Standard solar panels with finer aesthetic qualities – thinner, black frames and black backsheets – remain the most common product available.
Installations like Solaria’s, above, represent some of the cleanest lines to be found. The company’s shingled solar cells make it so you only see the black surface of silicon and aluminum framing.
One leading solar panel for residential customers is manufactured in Georgia at the Hanwha Q Cell factory. They’re available, reasonably priced (no import tariffs), and they offer adequate specs and aesthetics.
The Solar Marketplace Intel Report from EnergySage provides a list of potential pieces of hardware to buy. Note that EnergySage’s data does not represent 100% of the residential solar market, although it does offer a solid cross section of higher quality components.
Beyond looks, the reasons to choose one panel over another vary greatly. Efficiency, price, panel size, availability, country of origin, and even the environmental impacts of a panel’s manufacturing process all factor in.
Because the price of solar power systems has fallen, with solar panel prices decreasing even more so, pricing has stopped being the most important factor in a solar purchasing decision. The most important factors today are a combination of efficiency and product quality.
In the most recent Tracking the Sun report from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, we see a few the trends emerge as prices drop and efficiencies rise:
However, there is still a premium paid for more efficient solar panels. Sunpower’s Maxeon has  always been the most efficient, and typically the most expensive. Others, like the REC Alpha, LG’s Neon series, Solaria, and soon Meyer Burger’s heterojunction product, are moving into the same higher tier of efficiency greater than 22%.
After this tradeoff of looks vs. efficiency vs. price vs. availability, we turn toward less tangible factors such as location of manufacture, the specific technologies used, and even how much CO2 was emitted during the manufacturing process. These factors lead to the broad variety of panels we see in the market today. Because there are hundreds of different solar panels in the market, it is tough to cover all of them.
For instance, solar panels can be bought from many countries in the world, including the U.S. Some companies exclusively manufacture solar panels, while others – like LG or Panasonic – are part of international conglomerates. You could even buy a solar panel with polysilicon made via mostly hydropower.
Since 2014, the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research has shown the viability of painting the surface of a solar panel painted with nano-materials in the factory. And the company Sistine Solar sells its “solar skin”, a custom graphic overlay that preserves 92%-99% of a solar panel’s efficiency while matching the aesthetic of any building.
One final consideration is how much space you have available.
Those with limited roof space may want to take a close look at panel dimensions in order to maximize energy production. Residential panels tend to be roughly 65” long by 39” wide, but sizes are not written in stone (or polysilicon). For example, Sunpower has manufactured 425W panels that measure 72.2” by 40”. And Solaria’s PowerXT 400W panel is extra wide, at 64.72” by 47.4”.
If you’re sketching various configurations, add about 1” between panels for mid-clamps. Also remember that most states require panels to be set back 36” or more from the roof’s ridge. Some states like Massachusetts and Florida do not have any setback restrictions, which allows installation right up to the edge of your roof. Your local building inspectors and contractors should know exactly how much setback is required.
With all of these variables, you can get overwhelmed with choices; it’s kind of like buying a car.
One of the better pieces of advice might be to find a contractor you like and trust, and have her or him recommend products for your home. Lessons you’ve gleaned from this article will help you vet those panels.
