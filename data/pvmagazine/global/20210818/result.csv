Through its Strömma offer, the company and its Swedish partner, Svea Solar, will soon begin selling electricity produced exclusively by photovoltaics and wind to all kinds of residential customers, regardless of whether they live in a house or an apartment, and at a “low price.”
The electricity will be supplied by wind and solar facilities that cannot be older than five years, the company said in a statement, noting that this is aimed at creating pressure for new investment in renewable electricity production.
The offer implies the payment of a monthly fixed tariff of SEK39 ($4.40) plus a variable cost that depends on electricity consumption. The cost of the guarantee of origin is added to each kilowatt-hour used by the customer and is variable depending on the purchase price at which Svea Solar buys wind and solar power.
Ikea is currently active in the PV sector in Sweden, through the sale of its “Solstråle” PV modules. The Solstråle service is already offered in other countries where Ikea has signed partnership agreements with local installers to enable the sale of complete, turnkey home solar rooftop systems. It is currently available in France, Australia, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Poland and the U.K.

Symbio, which bills itself as the “UK's lowest priced electricity supplier” on its website, was due to have paid the money a week ago, with its quarterly contributions determined by the volume of electricity supplied.
However, the Watford-based supplier, which began operations in March 2019, has told Ofgem it will not be able to pay the money until September 3, more than three weeks late.
With Symbio having previously missed payments and failed to respond to a request from the regulator to see its cashflow forecasts, Ofgem today said it is also conducting the standard three-week consultation period before issuing a final order compelling the energy company to respond to the request to see its figures. If Symbio does not comply, Ofgem said, it could lose its operating license and face other penalties.
Symbio's website states: “Energy Freedom [sic] for all UK residants [sic] is our aim.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/18/tracing-the-roots-of-fill-factor-degradation-in-perovskite-silicon-tandem-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SAUDI ARABIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 18, 2021",Tracing the roots of fill factor degradation in perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells,"A group of scientists at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), in Saudi Arabia, began operating a testing field facility for small perovskite-silicon tandem cells in November of last year with the aim of collecting data on the performance of different devices. The findings, the researchers said at the time, should allow those working with perovskites to optimize their designs, and it will be these results that ultimately make or break their progress toward a commercial breakthrough.
Since then, the research group has analyzed data on performance and, more recently, it unveiled the results of a six-month outdoor test on the stability of the tandem cells. “It is one of longest [tests] ever carried out on the stability of this kind of cells and it has provided a large dataset to understand the mechanisms behind their degradation,” KAUST researcher Michele De Bastiani told pv magazine.
The academics analyzed, in particular, the diurnal and long-term evolution of three identical encapsulated, bifacial perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with an efficiency of around 23%, in a difficult climatic environment in terms of temperature, humidity and soiling. “We chose, here, the bifacial tandem configuration which mandates the use of narrow-bandgap perovskites, implying enhanced device stability thanks to their lower bromide content,” they specified, noting that the bandgap of the perovskite was 1.59 eV.
The six-month measurements showed that the devices exhibited negligible variations in open-circuit voltage and small losses in short circuit current density. By contrast, the cells' fill factor (FF) dropped from around 80% initially, to about 50% after six months.
In order to understand the reasons for the FF degradation, the Saudi group compared the hourly device performances during the first and last day of the dataset and found that its value was highest in the early morning and gradually declined throughout the day. “This reduction is concomitant with the rising of the ambient temperature, and hence, of the device,” it also explained. “Toward the evening a slight increase in FF (around 5%) can be seen, which suggests that during the day, the current matching between the top and bottom cells is altered, likely caused by variations in the albedo, resulting in higher FF values with increased current mismatch.”
The scientists identified two forms in which the FF dropped. The first one was described as ‘reversible decay', over the day, that recovered overnight, and was linked with ion migration in the perovskite; and the second one was presented as a steady and irreversible degradation mechanism, caused by corrosion of the silver metal top contact, with the formation of silver iodide.
Several strategies were suggested to resolve these two issues, including the use of new encapsulant materials and lamination processes, among others. All the details of these strategies and the testing can be found in the study Toward Stable Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Photovoltaics: A Six-Month Outdoor Performance Study in a Hot and Humid Climate, which was recently published in ACS Energy Letters.

An article published on the DEWA website yesterday – to announce the inauguration of the initial, 300 MW slice of the park's fifth phase – stated the utility expects 217 MW of the fourth phase of the park to become operational this year, in addition to the previously stated CSP generation capacities of 100 MW, from the world's tallest solar tower, and 200 MW in the related parabolic trough.
Pick up your copy of pv magazine today for an in-depth look at batteries big and small; how they’re changing and how they’re changing the world. What do batteries have in store for us? The August edition of pv magazine has answers to the big questions surrounding the battery energy storage revolution.
Mohammad Abunayyan, chairman of Saudi energy company ACWA Power – which is developing the fifth phase of the eventual 5 GW solar field along with regional body the Gulf Investment Corporation (GIC) – was quoted in the DEWA article as stating the first section of the stage was completed in “record time” of less than a year, helping explain why its first panels have started generating before any of the 950 MW fourth phase of the project.
pv magazine in June reported DEWA expected to commission the first 300 MW of phase V of the project last month and DEWA did not reveal yesterday whether that project milestone had been achieved, with the inauguration ceremony having been attended by the ruler of Dubai and vice-president and prime minister of the UAE, after whom the field is named.
DEWA said in June, it expects to commission the 100 MW solar tower in September with the parabolic trough to follow by the end of the year and the utility said yesterday, a further 217 MW of solar panel capacity would also be added this year, to ensure clean power facilities will make up 13.3% of the emirate's energy mix as Dubai aims for 75% by mid century.
ACWA Power, which is 50% state owned, and the GIC held by the states of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, won the contract to develop the AED2.06 billion ($561 million), 900 MW fifth phase of the solar field and will own 40% of the facilities installed, with DEWA retaining the balance. The development partners agreed to accept a then-world record low solar tariff of $0.016953 for each kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by the project's fifth phase.
The fifth phase is set to be completed by 2023, DEWA said yesterday. The 950 MW fourth phase of the site has an investment price tag of up to AED16 billion ($4.36 billion), pv magazine reported in June.

The technology, which is currently being developed with the support of the Japanese Ministry of Environment and the Mitsubishi Research Institute, should be able to inspect the solar modules and provide data on the traceability and components used, as well as verifying that these data were not modified or tampered with.
The use of this transparent technique, according to Next Energy, will enable the identification of a larger amount of modules that can still be reused or recycled, which would result in a reduction of the amount of waste in landfills and, in the case of modules being reused, would also lower their carbon footprint.
No more technical details on the inspection technology were provided.
Next Energy has been active in the PV module recycling business with its ‘Reborn' set of standards since 2005. It claims to have inspected more than 140,000 used modules to date.

The glassmaker reported the numbers yesterday as it announced its first-half figures, and said China had made 238,000 tons of polysilicon in the first half of the year, as well as 105 GW of silicon wafers, 92.4 GW of solar cells and 80.2 GW of solar modules.
Luoyang said those figures were “recently released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology” and amounted to a 57% year-on-year rise in cell output, a 51% hike in module production, a 40% uplift in wafer manufacturing and 16% growth in polysilicon output.
The bumper effect of solar panel glass prices which continued to rise into the first quarter of this year was illustrated by a first-half net profit of RMB222 million ($34.2 million) from Luoyang's new energy glass unit, a rise from RMB68.8 million in January-to-June last year. The 2021 six-month figure came from new energy operating income of RMB1.4 billion ($216 million) – up from RMB822 million ($127 million) a year ago.
By contrast, Luoyang's other main business, providing glass for information displays, posted a first-half net profit of RMB25.6 million ($3.95 million), from operating income of RMB195 million ($30 million).
The manufacturer said two new solar module glass production facilities in Hefei and Tongcheng remain on track to start operations next month and in November, respectively, and added plans are progressing for another new fab, in Yixing.

In June and July of this year, photovoltaics in the European Union delivered a total of 39 TWh of electricity, according to the British climate protection thinktank Ember – which operated under the name Sandbag until 2020. This production corresponds to about 10% of the region's total electricity demand. Germany and the Netherlands were able to reach 17% and Spain 16%.
Hungary has quadrupled its photovoltaic share since June-July 2018 and this summer produced more solar than coal electricity for the first time – 12% versus 10%. In the Netherlands, Italy, France, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Greece and Portugal, more electricity was generated from the sun than from coal this summer.
The Netherlands and Spain have doubled their photovoltaic share since 2018. In Estonia and Poland, three years ago, photovoltaics contributed almost nothing to the electricity mix; this year it was 10% and 5%, respectively.
Coal-fired power plants across the EU, meanwhile, delivered 58 TWh of electricity in June and July, still significantly more electricity than PV. The share of coal in the electricity mix was 14%. According to Ember, the growth of photovoltaics must be doubled in order to achieve the EU climate targets for 2030. This also makes economic sense, according to the thinktank, which said the prime costs of new solar parks are only half as high as those of existing coal-fired power plants in large markets such as Germany. Ember puts the solar figure, for 2020, at the equivalent of €48/MWh.
“Europe has a record solar summer behind it, but it is still a long way from exhausting its potential,” said Charles Moore, from Ember. “However, there is still a long way to go before photovoltaics can deliver more electricity than fossil fuels – even if the sun is high in Europe in summer.”

James Stewart, general manager of the state-owned ALEC Energy unit of Dubai-based construction company ALEC – quoted in a press release on the DEWA website – said: “Accredited laboratories will conduct numerous sophisticated performance tests, quality controls and rigorous durability tests prior to the manufacturing of the … PV panels.” DEWA did not announce any further technical details about the panels and cells to be installed on the roof and facade of its Al-Shera'a office, which is being planned in the Al Jaddaf area of the emirate.
Announcing the contract win by ALEC; Abu Dhabi-based main contractor Ghantoot Transport & General Contracting; and Canadian-owned consultant Atkins last week, DEWA said the project would feature almost 21,150m2 of rooftop PV and more than 1,000m2 of building-integrated PV on the facade, plus “shaded structure PV” and solar trees.
The utility said ALEC will design “customized, walkable solar panels with a high transparency feature.”
The two million square foot, 15-floor building, which will house 5,000 employees, is intended to consume no more energy than it will generate annually and has been designed to receive a platinum Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating and a gold rank from the WELL Building Standard.
ALEC's Stewart added: “This project and the integrated solar design truly pushes the boundaries of solar power further.”

The Austrian government has decided to earmark another €20 million ($23.4 million) for the country's residential solar subsidy program, as the funds previously allocated for this year have almost been exhausted.
The authorities will use the funds to support rooftop PV projects not exceeding 50 kW in size. The Climate and Energy Fund will grant between €150 and €250 per project, depending on the system size, and a €100 bonus per kilowatt-hour will be awarded to building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems.
“This year's funding was almost completely called up,” said Vera Immitzer, managing director of PV Austria, the local solar association. “The uncertainty was correspondingly great in the last few weeks, which posed great challenges for installers and potential system operators.”
The rebate scheme has sustained most of the country's solar growth over the past few years. In 2020, it helped bring 332 MW online. It is part of the “100,000 roofs program,” which is itself part of the “#mission2030” integrated climate and energy strategy (IKES), which aims for 100% clean electricity from renewable energy by 2030.
The country's cumulative installed PV capacity rose to 2.035 GW at the end of 2020. Through its incentive schemes, Austria is mainly supporting rooftop PV. To date, only a few ground-mounted PV plants have been built in the country. The largest solar park is an 11.5 MW facility that went online in March.

The potential safety concerns surrounding lithium-ion batteries have burst into the public eye of late with the recent fire at the Victorian Big Battery (VBB). However, researchers at Monash University School of Chemistry and Australian company Calix have been working on alternative ways to avoid such fire hazards and toxicity issues. 
As the VBB fire illustrated, fire hazards in lithium-ion batteries, although relatively rare, are a pressing issue. After all, utility-scale energy storage is set to grow across large sections of the grid, and a few tons of concrete isn’t always around to douse such resilient fires. 
Monash University Professor Doug MacFarlane and Dr. Mega Kar have been working with Calix on electrolyte development in the higher power batteries used for energy storage solutions and electric vehicles (EVs). In “Lithium borate ester salts for electrolyte application in next-generation high voltage lithium batteries,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials, the chemists describe a novel lithium salt that could replace the more hazardous hexafluorophosphate salt. 
“The lithium salt currently being used in lithium-ion batteries is lithium hexaflurosophosphate, which poses a fire and safety hazard as well as toxicity,” said MacFarlane. “In smaller portable devices, this risk can be partially mitigated. However, in a large battery pack, such as electric vehicles and outdoor grid scale energy storage systems, the potential hazard is much intensified. Higher voltage and power batteries are also on the drawing board, but cannot use the hexafluorophosphate salt.” 
The study’s lead author, the Monash University School of Chemistry’s Dr Binayak Roy, said that the “aim has been to develop safe fluoroborate salts, which are not affected even if we expose them to air. The main challenge with the new fluoroborate salts was to synthesise it with battery-grade purity, which we have been able to do by a recrystallization process.” 
The researchers put the novel salts into a lithium-ion battery with lithium manganese oxide cathodes and were able to cycle the cell for more than 1,000 cycles, “even after atmospheric exposure … an unimaginable feat compared to the hyper-sensitive hexafluorophosphate salt,” Roy said.
 
Roy said that the new electrolyte, when combined with a novel cathode material, far outperformed the conventional salt. It was also found to be very stable on aluminum current collectors at higher voltages, as will be necessary for next-gen batteries. 
Researchers collaborated with Calix on the study, as the company produces manganese-based battery materials from Australian sourced minerals. Calix hopes the research will help it in achieving its goal of large-scale fabrication of Australian-based lithium-ion batteries. 
“Calix is developing a platform technology to produce high-performance, cost-competitive battery materials in Australia,” said Calix General Manager for R&D Matt Boot-Handford. “The superior electrochemical performance and stability demonstrated by the Monash team’s new electrolyte system paired with Calix’s lithium manganese oxide electrode material is an exciting and important milestone that brings us one step closer to making batteries featuring Calix next-generation electrode materials a commercial reality.” 
Monash’s Kar noted that the aims is to eventually turn these new anions into thermally stable, non-flammable liquid salts, to make them beneficial for batteries operating at high temperatures.
“With the current climate conditions, designing such battery technologies with safety and stability will be important in implementing a sustainable grid-scale energy solution in Australia,” said Kar.

First Solar broke ground on its third manufacturing facility in Ohio on Aug. 17. The ceremony was attended by U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh, among other officials.
The new 3.3 GWdc facility is scheduled to start operations in the first half of 2023 and represents a $680 million investment. When it is fully operational, the facility is expected to scale the company’s northwestern Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6 GWdc.
The facility is expected to create more than 700 permanent jobs, in addition to the 1,600 people that First Solar currently employs in Ohio. First Solar, which was founded in 1999, has had a manufacturing presence in the state since it began commercial production at its original Perrysburg factory in 2002, when it produced 1.5 MWdc of modules per year and employed 150 people. Since then, the company has invested more than $2 billion to expand its Ohio manufacturing presence, making the state home to one of the largest photovoltaic solar manufacturing footprints in the Western Hemisphere when it commissioned its second factory in 2019.
The new facility will enable First Solar to produce an anticipated average of one module roughly every 2.75 seconds across its three-factory Ohio footprint once it achieves its full production capacity. The facility will include machine-to-machine communication, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things connectivity.
The 1.8 million-square-foot facility is expected to produce an enhanced thin-film PV module for the U.S. utility-scale solar market. It will be built by Rudolph Libbe, Inc., and is expected to create 500 construction jobs over the next 18 months.
