The companies said in a press release that Bouygues Energies & Services and Solkompaniet will lead the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract for the Nordic project. The project will feature low-carbon PV panels surrounding the Hultsfred airport runway, connecting to utility E.ON, with the CEO of E.ON Energidistribution noting its significance for southern Sweden's electricity supply.
The developers aim to make the project operational by 2025, with 95% of the energy sold to H&M Group through a long-term power purchase agreement, supporting the retailer's renewable energy goals. The specific use of the energy remains unspecified.
Last year, H&M received a notification from the Norwegian Consumer Authority over reportedly misleading “environmental claims” regarding “value chain sustainability.” The European Parliament also mentioned the brand, alongside retail giant Zara, in a fast fashion report in 2022.
In September, Alight said that another project would soon begin construction in the Nordic region – a 100 MW ground-mounted solar park in Eurajok, Finland.
Sweden recorded 2,606 MW of solar PV installed capacity at the end of last year, according to the most recent figures published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

The move will be in effect for the next 18 months and is said to be due to the current Israel-Hamas conflict.
Storage units exempt from permits will be limited to 30 m2, according to a statement supplied by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure. They will also need to “maintain the reliability of energy supply during emergencies.” Energy units are expected to support the local authorities operating rooms and civilian gathering centers.
According to the statement, civilian gathering centers are designated public buildings such as schools. This is where civilians can evacuate during emergencies. Operation rooms are where civilian emergency operations occur.
“This measure is just the first,” said Eitan Parnass, director of the country's major renewable energy lobby group, the Green Energy Association of Israel. He told pv magazine that “rapid implementation of electricity storage” in Israel is expected to follow.
“Storage will play a major role in Israel's electricity market in the coming years,” Parnass said. “The capability of microgrids to survive blackout is a vivid reality in Israel, and a lesson for other modern electricity markets. In Israel, it's missiles that are jeopardizing the grid, but in other countries, climate change and extreme weather can be the cause.”

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/25/voltfang-launches-new-life-commercial-storage-system-with-45-kwh-capacity/,"UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"OCTOBER 25, 2023",Voltfang launches ‘New Life’ commercial storage system with 45 KWh capacity,"From pv magazine Germany
Voltfang, an Aachen-based energy storage start-up, has announced its latest product titled “New Life”. The company claims the commercial battery storage system is 30% higher in performance and capacity. Compared to Voltfang's standard battery, the net capacity has increased from 33 to 45 KWh, which corresponds to a gross capacity of 58 KWh. According to Voltfang, the solution is particularly suitable for use in charging infrastructure, food-retail and commercial areas with high power peaks.
The battery storage systems can be scaled up. With two racks, the usable battery capacity reaches 90 KWh hours and can be expanded up to a maximum of 1350 KWh. Voltfang specifies the nominal voltage of the battery as 800 V. The weight of one rack is about 700 kg. The dimensions are given in the datasheet as 2100x800x600 mm. Voltfang specifies the optimal temperature range for the storage systems is 5 to 35 degrees Celsius. Above or below, there could be a reduction in performance. The ambient temperature should be in a range between -10 and +50 degrees Celsius.
The modules for the “New Life” battery storage systems came from overproduction in the automotive industry. According to Voltfang, they are completely new and have not yet been installed anywhere. They are based on NMC technology. The manufacturer uses them to build its own batteries. The battery storage systems are compatible with the “Kaco blueplanet gridsave” inverter.
The improvements resulted from a close exchange with the company's partner network and technical product development. The “New Life” battery storage system is suitable for significantly reducing energy costs, the company said. Voltfang did not provide any information on the price.
In August, Voltfang released its first outdoor commercial storage system with capacities between 33 and 644 KWh. Robust housing protects the battery storage system outdoors from sun, rain and other environmental influences. Good insulation allows the storage system to be used at temperatures between -20 and +50 degrees Celsius.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/25/solargis-notes-potential-inaccuracies-in-tropical-solar-irradiance-data/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",ANGELA SKUJINS,"OCTOBER 25, 2023",Solargis notes potential inaccuracies in tropical solar irradiance data,"Solargis said in a press release this week that “higher deviations” between satellite models and solar measurements in the tropics affect the “accuracy and reliability” of solar resource assessments and forecasts. It pointed to higher-quality assessments and on-the-ground solar measuring stations as potential solutions.
“Markets in the tropics have enormous opportunities for solar development,” said Solargis CEO Marcel Suri.
“To realize this potential the industry must collaborate to improve the quality of resource assessments and solar forecasts by increasing the number and geographical distribution of solar measuring stations.
“We need to create confidence by delivering consistently excellent data to support project financing that underpins the significant growth potential of these regions.”
The analysts came to this conclusion by comparing data published in the International Energy Agency’s “Worldwide Benchmark of Modelled Solar Irradiance Data 2023” report, a Solargis spokesperson told pv magazine. The report includes benchmarks of model-derived direct normal irradiance (DNI) and global horizontal irradiance (GHI) data for the sites of 129 globally distributed ground-based radiation measurement stations.
Solargis
The spokesperson said Solargis analysts used this data to investigate whether the deviations were consistent worldwide. They combined the information with the IEA’s findings and discovered that the deviations were “more pronounced” in tropical regions.
“This prompted Solargis’ analysts to delve deeper into understanding the reasons behind these discrepancies, and what impact these larger deviations could have on the solar markets in tropical regions,” the spokesperson said. The team found that larger deviations create “greater uncertainty” and risk over revenue calculations. This led to potential difficulties in obtaining financing for projects.
“Solargis also concluded that utilising accurate, high-frequency data and more ground stations could improve the accuracy of modelled solar irradiance estimates,” they said.
“This is because such enhancements would better capture fluctuations in solar resources caused by regional climate and geographical factors.”
The press release said that aside from scientific institutions and universities, there is a “notable scarcity” of ground-based solar measurement stations collecting data in the tropics. Due to this information gap, developers are paying to install their own ground measurement systems within the design phase of their respective PV projects.
“These are costly to maintain in remote areas, needing infrastructure investment as well as a specialist workforce to take the project from initial development through to operation,” the press release said. “Additionally, this can cause project delays as it takes around 2 to 3 years until a significant amount of reliable and accurate data is available.”
The spokesperson did not offer an estimation on how much money would be “unlocked” with improved technology, as inaccurate data affects all stages of the development of solar projects. The representative could also not specify the number of additional ground measurement systems required for a clearer irradiance picture.
The tropics present unique challenges for solar deployment, including faster degradation of crystalline silicon PV modules in humidity. Fast-moving and scattered clouds, changes in aerosols, and strong precipitation patterns are also known to affect solar irradiance, according to the press release.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/25/caribbean-could-become-offshore-floating-solar-pv-giant-researcher-says/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CENTRAL & SOUTH AMERICA,PUERTO RICO",ANGELA SKUJINS,"OCTOBER 25, 2023","Caribbean could become offshore floating solar PV giant, researcher says","Christian Breyer, a solar economy professor at Finland-based LUT University, told pv magazine that if the Caribbean and its 13 countries seized on the right opportunities, the region could become a “global center” for offshore floating solar PV energy generation.
“Land-based PV systems will be developed first. However, the substantial electricity demand may lead to limitations in land availability, which can be overcome by offshore floating PV,” he said.
Breyer recently co-authored a paper exploring the potential of solar PV in the Caribbean’s chain of islands. The paper investigates various renewable energy generation methods with a special focus on the efficacy and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of offshore floating PV arrays in Puerto Rico.
Puerto Rico, a North American territory that consumes almost 70 times more energy than it produces, aims to power its hurricane-impacted electricity grid with only renewable energy by 2050.
According to the research, however, both the wider Caribbean region and the island of Puerto Rico are lagging in renewable energy capacities. Puerto Rico recorded 841 MW installed total renewable energy capacity in 2022, with 639 MW comprising solar PV, according to the most recent data published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
The paper posits that as the Caribbean has limited available land, offshore floating PV should be considered. After examining multiple renewable energy generation scenarios, the paper states: “The results for Puerto Rico clearly indicate the enormous benefits of reaching 100% renewable energy, as the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) can be reduced from more than €10o ($106.2)/MWh in 2020 to €47.4 MW/h in 2050.”
“The dominating source of energy for electricity supply and the entire energy system is found to be solar PV with 80% and 91% of supply share in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, respectively,” the researchers said in the paper. “When limited offshore land availability is applied, a substantial share of all PV generation can be provided by offshore floating PV for minimal extra costs.”
When asked how feasible floating solar PV actually is in the region, Breyer said onshore floating PV is “standard” while offshore floating PV solar arrays have been developed in “various regions around the world”.
The International Solar Energy Society forecasted that areas that don’t record waves larger than 6 m or winds stronger than 15 m/s could generate up to one million TWh per year through offshore floating PV arrays. Onshore and offshore solar PV floating projects, however, come with their own technological challenges.
“The special conditions in the Caribbean with hurricane risk require special consideration of regions with better natural storm protection,” Breyer said. “I would assume that somehow stronger structures should be used, while the more protected areas will be the most important aspect. Onshore PV systems have to be also hurricane proof, thus, that may be similar for offshore floating PV systems.”
In the last decade, there have been 20 recorded hurricanes and tropical storms making landfall in Puerto Rico. When Hurricane Maria battered the island in 2017, it took the electricity grid almost 11 months to recover – making it the longest blackout in North American history.
The paper, titled “Role of Solar Photovoltaics for Sustainable Energy System in Puerto Rico in the Context of the Entire Caribbean Featuring the Value of Offshore Floating Systems,” was published in IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics.

In a recently published paper, the cooling technique is claimed to consist of heat absorber pipes thermally connected to the PV module, heat releaser pipes that exchange heat with the water body, a series of connecting pipes and a coolant reservoir. The system reportedly creates a continuous fluid flow that dissipates heat from the PV cells to the surroundings.
The cooling loop device consists of connecting pipes with a diameter of 16 mm, a fluid reservoir with a diameter of 100 mm, heat-absorber and heat-releaser pipes.
“The heat-absorber and heat-releaser pipes are constructed from 14×14 mm square aluminum pipes with a thickness of 0.5 mm. The cooling loop device connects the hot region at the top and the cold region at the bottom,” the paper states, noting that the heat-absorber pipes receive the thermal energy from the solar modules and then heat up the fluid inside the pipe.
The cooling loop system also comprises a reservoir at the top of the cooling loop, which creates a buoyancy-driven flow. The heat-releaser pipes are placed at the bottom and submerged in the constant temperature of the water.
The scientists conducted a series of tests of the proposed cooling technology in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia, with solar irradiance in the region ranging from 227.2 W/m2 to 1153.2 W/m2.
“The actual temperature and electrical performance of floating photovoltaic panel were measured through experiments that varied the reservoir height,” the paper states. The natural convection cooling loops effectively enhance the electrical efficiency of the floating photovoltaic panels by reducing the photovoltaic cell temperature from 318.8 Kelvin to 315.3 Kelvin. “The electrical efficiency under solar irradiance of approximately 1000 W/m2 increased by 17.84% with the introduction of a reservoir height of 750 mm.”
The group also conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis on the novel tech and said it can substantially lower a floating PV system's levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and payback period. “In the future, the envisioned floating photovoltaic systems equipped with natural convection cooling loops could potentially evolve into multifunctional systems capable of generating both electrical and thermal energies, thereby optimizing overall energy efficiency,” the research concluded.
The cooling system was introduced in the paper “Design and analysis of passively cooled floating photovoltaic systems,” published in Thermal Engineering. The research team includes academics from the Israel Institute of Technology, the Khalifa University in the UAE, the Institut Teknologi Bandung and the Universitas Sebelas Maret in Indonesia.

According to a recently published scientific paper touting the efforts, the model utilizes two machine learning techniques – K-Means and long-short-term memory (LSTM) – and has a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.7766. The aim of the tool is to overcome “fault detection and classification” often found in traditional operating systems, the paper claims.
“The conventional operation and maintenance (O&M) of solar PV systems do not utilize machine learning for fault detection and classification,” the paper states. “This poses challenges for plant operators, especially those managing large-scale solar (LSS) PV plants, who typically rely on manual approaches to screen large amounts of electrical data and inspect numerous string panels. Consequently, the cost of O&M is high.”
K-Means is an algorithm for data segmentation and groups similar data points into clusters. The researchers use the algorithm to cluster the electrical current of string modules with environmental factors such as global irradiance and module temperature. A center or mean point is then created for the cluster to represent typical behavior.
Then the LSTM technique, trained on historical data, kicks in. The technique aims to detect anomalies in the predicted electrical current of string modules, which would then alert operators of maintenance needs.
“LSTMs can handle sequential data with variable length input by using gate mechanism to decide which information is important to persist and which to discard in each time step, thus making predictions based on the past trends and patterns in the input sequence,” the paper states. “LSTMs can do this by using a special type of memory cell that can store information for long periods of time, as well as gates that control the flow of information into and out of the cell.”
The data for the training, as well as the method's precision analysis, is based on information sourced from a large-scale solar PV plant located in the center of Malaysia. A turnkey and sub-inverter were used as test cases, monitoring 420 string modules and a total of 8,400 PV modules. Compared to the collected data, the model has a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.7766.
The relative error is then compared with the number set by the benchmark model based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN). “LSTM and ANNs are often compared because they are both belong to neural networks and commonly used in various natural language processing, computer vision and speech recognition tasks,” the paper states. They found the LSTM is more precise with an average LSTM relative error of 4.316% and an ANN relative error of 4.363%.
The algorithm was described in the study “Anomaly detection using K-Means and long-short term memory for predictive maintenance of large-scale solar (LSS) photovoltaic plant,” which was recently published in Energy Reports. The research group was formed by scientists from the Solar Research Institute (SRI), Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), and the Chiang Mai Rajabhat University.

The Australian federal government has announced a AUD 2 billion expansion in financing available under its Critical Minerals Facility to back Australian critical minerals mining and processing projects.
Speaking in the United States, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the finance boost will help facilitate the transition to a decarbonized economy while cementing Australia’s position as a world-leading provider of critical minerals used in clean energy technologies like electric vehicles, storage batteries, wind turbines and solar panels.
According to Albanese, Australia’s critical minerals are the building blocks for a clean energy future, and harnessing their capacity is essential to the government’s commitment to transforming Australia into a renewable energy superpower.
“We want to move Australia up the international value chain in critical minerals, energy and manufacturing,” Albanese said at a press conference in Washington, adding that the funding increase will help to develop supply chains with the United States and support shared clean energy and manufacturing ambitions. “Australia is committed to building sustainable and secure critical minerals supply chains with the United States. This is central to building a clean energy future and delivering economic growth.”
Independent modeling shows increasing exports of critical minerals and energy-transition minerals could create more than 115,000 new jobs and add AUD 71.2 billion to Australia’s gross domestic product by 2040.
“Australians will benefit through this investment in critical minerals, through technology, skills, jobs and economic gains,” Albanese said.
The extra financing will double the capacity of the Critical Minerals Facility, managed by the government’s Export Finance Australia (EFA) agency. Under the facility, companies can apply for loans, financial guarantees or performance and warranty bonds to help establish projects and develop export markets.
The facility is also aimed at reducing China’s dominance of global supply chains for processed materials. While Australia has some of the world’s richest deposits of critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, vanadium and significant deposits of rare earth elements, China currently dominates the critical minerals processing sector.
About 75% of the world’s lithium and 85% of cobalt is processed in China. It also refines more than 90% of the world’s graphite, a mineral crucial to the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles.
Only last week China announced plans to restrict exports of graphite, saying permits will be needed from December for synthetic graphite material — including high-purity, high-strength and high-density versions — as well as for natural flake graphite.
The announcement came just days after the United States extended its restrictions on the kinds of semiconductors that American companies can sell to Chinese firms.
Australian Resources Minister Madeleine King said creating a sustainable and reliable supply of critical minerals is vital to supporting the Australian and United States’ manufacturing sectors.
“The road to net zero runs through Australia’s resources sector,” she said. “We are well positioned to be a world-leading provider of critical minerals, including rare earths elements, and to support global efforts on clean energy transformation.”
