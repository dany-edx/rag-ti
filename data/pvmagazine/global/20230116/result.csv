UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, who is also CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC Group) and the chairman of the state's renewable energy firm Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar), provided the event's opening address.
The UAE's decision to name Jaber the chair of the upcoming COP28 discussions recently attracted criticism due to the potential conflict of interest seen in an oil boss heading the climate summit. However, if Jaber's opening address is anything to go by, the ADNOC CEO and Masdar chairman is capable of wearing many hats, but is also under no illusion as to the urgency of the transition to clean energy.

“We have a full and clear understanding of what is at stake,” said Jaber, adding that climate action was at the heart of UAE's development strategy. “For us, sustainable development is about never settling for the now. It is always about the next … Because next never stops.”
Jaber went on to state the emirate's ambition for COP28 to be a “COP of action. A COP where the global north and global south really listen to each other. A COP where we move from goals to getting it done … And a COP where we deliver a new deal on climate finance.”
While ADNOC is one of the world's major oil companies, it also has a 24% stake in Masdar, and through Masdar the UAE Jaber is overseeing one of the region's most pragmatic approaches to transitioning a fossil-fuel based economy to a green energy economy.
“The road to net zero represents the biggest market transformation with the greatest economic promise since the first industrial revolution,” continued Jaber. “As we prepare to host COP28 in November, I ask myself: can the world come together to meet the urgency of this moment? Can the world cut emissions in half in the next seven years? My answer is yes.”
The decision to name an oil boss as head of the COP28 summit was always going to court controversy. But among attendees of ADSW there are no shortage of people who see Jaber as uniquely capable for the role, a figure with a hand in both the fossil fuel and renewable energy industries. One such supporter is Frans Timmermans, the European Commission's executive vice president for the European Green Deal.
Speaking at the Masdar-hosted ADSW, Timmermans said he was “really excited about the ambitions expressed [by Jaber], I have such confidence in his ability to steer us into the right direction. Look at his track record, impressive track record, he started with sustainability policies long before anybody else in the oil and gas sector.”
“Now, we have some really tough cookies in that sector that we need to address,” continued Timmermans, “but I want them onboard, I don't want them vilified, and I want him to help convince other executives in oil and gas to finally start investing in the transition towards renewable energy.”
Timmermans added that oil and gas executives have “a lot of assets that are going to be essential in a post carbon world.”
This reasoning is shared by International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Deputy Director-General Gauri Singh. Singh told pv magazine that the UAE's decision to host COP28 is a bold one. “This boldness shows the world that despite being a very large oil and gas producer, the country and its leadership are looking very actively to mov beyond oil.”
“More importantly, the UAE is very committed to assisting other countries along the energy transition path,” said Singh. “One of the UAE's priorities is unlocking renewable energy finance, and this is the key right now in order to deploy more renewables in developing countries.”
Singh concurred with Timmermans that the UAE's track record is impressive. Singh pointed to the country's invitation for IRENA to base its headquarters in Abu Dhabi way back in 2010 when many developed nations were still arguing over the existence of climate change let alone taking an active interest in renewable energy.
For a nation that prides itself on a sense of pragmatism like the UAE, there is hope that Jaber may prove a functional intermediary between the waning days of oil and a more sustainable future.

The results of the survey will be used to develop recommendations for the integration of PV systems into smart grids and to identify country-specific features of PV integration. To jump straight into the survey, click here, or read on for more information.
PV integration
As the development of renewables is drawing more attention, the integration of PV systems at all system levels has automatically become a major topic. With a view on the current innovations regarding the digitalization of photovoltaic systems, it seems that we are not yet profiting from the potential synergy of PV integration into smart grids. Currently, the integration of PV systems into distribution grids is still mainly done following a “fit and forget” approach. However, with increasing grid penetration, the fluctuating energy feed-in from PV systems poses many challenges for existing grids and possibly also for market processes.
In the past, energy was provided by a few hundred large, centralized power plants and the energy flow was predominantly through a one-way street from the transmission grid to the distribution grid. However, with the increased use of renewable decentralized energy systems – primarily wind power and solar power plants – the majority of energy provision is shifting to the distribution grids. However, the distribution grids were not initially built to harmonize modern renewable systems. Moreover, the conventional demand-side systems are turning into more intelligent local systems combining generation units and consumption devices. This new role is defined as “prosumer”. These systematic changes require the utilization of advanced technologies, the implementation of new applications and concepts, as well as the realization of more information transparency in the distribution grids.
The word “integration” is quite a general term, which represents many different conceptual, technical, and business processes involving diverse participant roles. This includes the interconnection with prosumer energy systems, PV system registration, validation of physical interconnection, bidirectional communication, data transition and status monitoring, intelligent control and PV curtailment, interface to the balancing power market and local energy market, the data provision for grid simulation and state estimation, etc.
Examples of solutions
The integration of PV systems into smart grids starts already behind the meter. Today’s PV inverters increasingly become the “heart” of the prosumer energy system. In addition to the sole conversion of solar energy fed into the electric grid, PV inverters integrate battery storage, optimize EV charging and take control over flexible loads based on the local weather forecast. When interconnecting a PV system to the electrical grid, registration is necessarily required by the grid operator to ensure grid stability. Additional registrations are often needed, for example, for funding databases or re-dispatch, so the paperwork load is increasing.
For 100%-renewable-based power systems, many countries and grid operators are discussing and defining solutions for PV curtailment. In addition, the active control over millions of power systems should take cyber threats into account. The design of the Smart Meter infrastructure in Germany, led by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), regulates the control of small PV systems starting from 7 kWp using two-way communication. The latest research project demonstrated the capability of this Smart Meter infrastructure to integrate small PV systems into the balancing power market.
All these processes and examples highlight the potential of effective integration of PV systems into Smart Grids from the view of different stakeholders; in the era of digitalization, cybersecurity measures need to be considered to ensure a safe operation of the PV systems and secured data transition via remote telecommunication connections.
We appreciate your valuable contribution and feedback that help us gain deeper insights into the current state-of-the-art solutions, possible improvements, and potential risks, as we move toward future sustainable energy systems with high PV penetration in the era of digitalization and energy transition.

TotalEnergies has unveiled the results of the first harvest from three agrivoltaic demonstrators in the French municipalities of Channay (Côte-d'Or), Rivals (Aude), and Valpuiseaux (Essonne).
It said it aims to study the impact of solar panels on crops in order to be able to develop a repository of the agronomic benefits of agrivoltaic projects. For this purpose, it chose different configurations of PV systems and crops.
The agrivoltaic plant in Le Channay, for example, is made up of vertical bifacial photovoltaic panels with 237 kW of power. There are 12 meters of spacing between the modules, as well as several types of crops, including wheat and aromatic herbs.
TotalEnergies said it is analyzing the contribution of photovoltaics on a plot of land with declining yield. It noted that the Le Channay location is subject to climatic challenges such as wind, frost and drought.
During the summer 2022 harvest, TotalEnergies, agronomy consultancy Agrosolutions, Dijon Céréales, and Next2Sun were able to record an increase in yield of 1 quintal per hectare for wheat compared to previous harvests and 2 quintals for lentils. They found that wheat protein levels increased by 2%. One explanation could be the protection against high winds, as the panels reduce average wind speeds by 14 km/hour.
TotalEnergies also developed the Valpuiseaux site with Agrosolutions, Agrinovex and Next2Sun. It features vertical bifacial modules. In addition, it developed the Rivals demonstrator with Sudexpe, IFV, InVivo and Ombrea, with 87 kW deployed above pomegranate trees and vines.
The group of companies said the results will now need to be confirmed over time. TotalEnergies currently has more than 140 agrivoltaic projects in various stages of development.

They are designed for home backup, off-grid applications, and powering small industrial machinery.
The system can be used in combination with solar panels. The 4,000 W power station has a peak power of 6000 W and 2,611 Wh of capacity. It can be fully recharged by a 600 W solar panel in 5.5 hours, according to the company. Other charging options include AC, DC, and USB-C inputs.
“These portable power stations are built around a state-of-the-art solid electrolyte in place of the bulky and flammable liquid electrolyte found in traditional lithium-ion batteries, which improves performance and represents a giant leap forward for battery technology,” Yoshino said in a statement. “Higher energy density means the same amount of power fits into a smaller, lighter package – up to half the weight per watt compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries.”
The smallest battery measures 25.4 cm x 15.5 cm x 24.1 cm and weighs in at 4.58 kg. The largest one measures 54.3 cm x 25.9 cm x 23.8 cm and weighs 24.99 kg. They can reportedly run for 2,500 cycles to 80% capacity.
The 2,000 W and 4,000 W models feature uninterruptible power supply (UPS) when plugged into wall sockets. Yoshino is selling the products starting at $349 retail. They feature a 36-month warranty.
The solution includes a mobile app to monitor charge level, battery health, and connected devices. The entire product range will be available from May.

Central Coast Community Energy in California has executed a 25-year power purchase agreement with Hydrostor, valued at nearly $1 billion, for 200 MW/1600 MWh of energy storage from a planned 500 MW compressed air energy storage system.
Hydrostor’s storage technology can cost-effectively store up to eight hours of energy, the company says, without using fuels, on a footprint significantly smaller than a comparably sized pumped hydro storage facility. The 500 MW project will require less than 100 acres. The California project is one of four energy storage projects that Hydrostor is developing throughout the world, after completing two pilot-scale projects.
A Hydrostor video says its technology stores energy by first using electricity to run a compressor, producing heated compressed air, and capturing and storing the heat using a thermal management system. The compressed air is then sent underground through a shaft, and stored in purpose-built caverns that are initially full of water. In the process, the compressed air forces the water up a shaft into a closed loop reservoir on the surface.
When power is needed, water from the reservoir is allowed to fill the underground caverns, driving the stored compressed air up a shaft to the surface, where it is heated with stored heat and then expanded through a turbine to generate electricity.
Central Coast Community Energy (3CE) said its 200 MW share of the project will help the agency meet its goal of providing 100% clean and renewable electricity by 2030 to its 447,000 customers between Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara counties. The project is located outside Rosamond in Kern County, and known as Willow Rock.
“Retiring fossil fuels requires tremendous amounts of energy storage and that will require developing new technologies and improvements to existing technologies,” said Robert Shaw, chief operating officer of 3CE. “In pushing the envelope, we are clearing the path toward reliability and reduced emissions.”
3CE has executed 19 power purchase and energy storage agreements since its formation in 2017. The agency currently has commitments for 856 MW of clean and renewable generation and 285 MW of energy storage capacity. Five of these projects came online last year, currently serving 22% of the agency’s load.
Hydrostor said the Willow Rock project will charge using surplus renewable energy and discharge to the grid at times of higher demand, reducing the need for new peak-demand generating facilities and deferring the need for “costly, difficult-to-permit” transmission lines.
The company expects the project to employ up to 40 full-time operators, and to have no performance degradation over a 50-plus year lifespan.
As Hydrostor’s technology employs “proven components” from the hydrocarbon sector, the company says it “delineates a clear pathway for skillsets and expertise from the fossil fuel industry to play a central role in the global energy transition.”
Toronto-based Hydrostor said that offtake discussions are ongoing with several parties for the 300 MW balance of the 500 MW project. Formed in 2010, the company calls its technology Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage, or A-CAES.
On January 10, 2022, the company received a $250 million equity investment from the private equity group of Goldman Sachs, with a further $25 million investment from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in April.

GameChange Solar, a specialist in fixed-tilt racking and tracker equipment, has announced the launch of the 1P-2Row Genius Tracker, which comes standard with preassembled components.
“The system is a cost-effective and optimal solution for certain projects and countries,” said Derick Botha, chief commercial officer at GameChange Solar.
In November, the company announced the MaxDensity system, which is a fixed-tilt racking system for ground-mounted projects. It has a 5-degree or 10-degree east-west landscape configuration. The system is designed to maximize the number of modules packed onto a site, with a ground coverage ratio of up to 98%. It can be installed in blocks of up to 7 MW, in configurations of up to 12,000 modules. It supports all commercially available framed modules, according to the company.
In December, GameChange announced plans to increase its annual domestic manufacturing capacity in the United States to 24 GW. The company has expanded existing facilities and established new factories, and reports that it now has factories in Michigan, Ohio, New York, New Jersey, New Orleans, Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky.
In 2021, the company released BifacialReflector, a patent-pending technology designed to boost power production by 15% to 20% for the Genius Tracker when using bifacial modules. It said the BifacialReflector is a highly reflective (.95 albedo) surface that reflects light from just above ground level to the back of the bifacial modules. The solution is self-cleaning and has a 40-year life expectancy.
In December 2021, GameChange Solar Holdings Corp. received an investment of $150 million from Koch Strategic Platforms (KSP), a subsidiary of Koch Investments Group. The preferred stock investment, if converted, would represent a minority stake in the company. In addition to capital investment, the two are exploring further synergies across Koch Industries, including KBX, a global transportation, logistics, and technology arm, and Koch Engineered Solutions.
