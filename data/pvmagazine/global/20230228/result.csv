BMW uses fuel cells sourced from Toyota Motor. The vehicle's powertrain has a maximum output of 295 kW/401 hp. The gaseous hydrogen needed to supply the fuel cell is stored in two 700-bar tanks made from carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP). Together, they hold 6 kg of hydrogen, giving the BMW iX5 Hydrogen a range of 504 km in the worldwide harmonized light vehicle test procedure (WLTP) cycle. Refueling the hydrogen tanks takes three to four minutes. “We will go into production in the second half of this decade,” said Juergen Guldner, BMW's hydrogen program manager.
Everfuel and Hy24 have announced a new joint venture to finance the accelerated development of electrolyzer capacity across Scandinavia. Everfuel will own 51% of the venture, and the Hy24-managed Clean H2 Infra Fund will own 49%. The venture plans to invest €200 million ($212.8 million) in equity in green hydrogen infrastructure in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, in order to build, own and operate up to 1 GW of green hydrogen projects.
Sinopec has launched a methanol-to-hydrogen and hydrogen refueling service station in Dalian, China. “The storage and transportation cost of methanol is also much lower than hydrogen, making methanol-to-hydrogen an ideal hydrogen production technology,” said the company.
John Cockerill and the Vietnamese authorities have agreed to collaborate on the development and production of renewable energy and green hydrogen. Vietnam sees Belgium as a preferential partner in hydrogen research.
StormFisher Hydrogen and Germany's Kiwi have signed a deal to advance the development of green hydrogen-related projects in North America and Europe. “The partnership falls in line with ambitions from the Canadian and German government to enhance energy security with clean Canadian hydrogen,” said the two companies.

They claim it offers superior safety and performance.
The solid electrolyte is composed of a ceramic polymer material made from relatively inexpensive elements in nanoparticle form. Specifically, the new composite electrolyte is based on Li10GeP2S12 nanoparticles embedded in a modified polyethylene oxide polymer matrix, which enables chemical reactions that produce lithium oxide (Li2O) on discharge.
In past lithium-air designs, the lithium in a lithium metal anode moves through a liquid electrolyte to combine with oxygen during the discharge, yielding lithium peroxide (Li2O2) or superoxide (LiO2) at the cathode. The lithium peroxide or superoxide is then broken back down into its lithium and oxygen components during the charge. This chemical sequence stores and releases energy on demand.
“The chemical reaction for lithium superoxide or peroxide only involves one or two electrons stored per oxygen molecule, whereas that for lithium oxide involves four electrons,” said Argonne chemist Rachid Amine.
In the new design, the four-electron reaction is enabled by a mixed ion-electron-conducting discharge product and its interface with the air.
More electrons stored means higher energy density. Theoretically, a lithium-air battery based on Li2O formation can deliver an energy density that is comparable to that of gasoline. It has the highest projected energy density of any battery technology being considered for the next generation of batteries beyond lithium-ion.
“With further development, we expect our new design for the lithium-air battery to also reach a record energy density of 1,200 watt-hours per kilogram,” said Larry Curtiss, an Argonne Distinguished Fellow. “That is nearly four times better than lithium-ion batteries.”
The team’s new design is also the first lithium-air battery to achieve a four-electron reaction at room temperature. In addition, it operates with oxygen supplied by air from the surrounding environment, thus eliminating the need for oxygen tanks, which was a problem with earlier designs.
Past lithium-air test cells have suffered from very short cycle lives. But the US researchers say that this is not the case with their new battery design, as their test cell demonstrated stability over 1,000 charge and discharge cycles.
They discussed their research findings in “A room temperature rechargeable Li2O-based lithium-air battery enabled by a solid electrolyte” which was published in a recent issue of Science.

If Germany wants to achieve its solar energy targets set for the second half of this decade, the nation will need to annually install triple the amount it added in 2022, when 7.19 GW of PV were connected to the grid. However, there is currently a lack of skilled workers to deploy PV systems in the country, as in the rest of Europe. Germany alone cannot compensate for the shortage, according to BSW-Solar, the German PV industry association. Workers should therefore be recruited from India.
Under a training program launched by the Indian Ministry of Renewable Energy, young electricians can be trained to become “suryamitra” (solar workers) within three months. To date, 51,000 “suryamitra” have completed the training course. And if the German federal government and BSW-Solar have their way, these Indian specialists will also contribute to PV expansion plans in Germany.
“The placement of well-trained specialists for the solar industry in Germany is important for our energy transition,” said German State Secretary Udo Philipp.
BSW-Solar works with the “Hand-in-Hand for International Talent” project to integrate specialists, with funding from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection, the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, the Federal Employment Agency and the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce. BSW-Solar is counting on a new immigration law for skilled workers to arrive in Germany in the summer. It aims to further promote the integration of foreign skilled workers into the German solar industry.
Business representatives say the German federal government has ignored the nation's shortage of skilled workers for years. At the “Handelsblatt Energie-Gipfel 2023” event in January, companies presented their own initiatives to recruit workers. However, politicians now recognize the seriousness of the situation. This can be seen in the task force set up in the Chancellery to address the shortage of skilled workers.

The two companies raised €87.5 million, from an initial target of €100 million. The funds will finance on-grid and off-grid solar plants for small- and medium-sized commercial and industrial customers in Africa.
The first closing includes a commitment from the European Investment Bank (EIB), International Finance Corp. (IFC), the Finland-IFC Blended Finance for Climate Program, the Belgian Investment Company for Developing Countries (BIO), and Proparco. Societe Generale and BNP Paribas also participated in the first funding round.
“Africa boasts 39% of the world's total renewable potential, and yet investment in renewable energy has been lagging behind, for a set of reasons that include the lack of suitable financial instruments, which especially affects the most dynamic segment of the market, commercial and industrial solar users,” said Olivier Leruste, the president of Echosys Invest, which is the joint venture that manages the Afrigreen Debt Impact Fund's investment strategy.
BloombergNEF reports that global investments in renewable energy increased by 9% year on year to an all-time high in 2021. However, investments fell by 35% in Africa, representing just 0.6% of all global renewable energy investments. Afrigreen said it aims to bridge this funding gap through direct lending and asset-based debt facilities for regional and international developers and African commercial and industrial companies.
“Representing 90% of all businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises, and industries are a segment that struggles to attract financing,” said Rgreen Invest CEO Nicolas Rochon. “We target a diversified portfolio comprising 20 to 30 investments, intervening to meet long-term debt financing needs hovering between €10 million and €15 million, with an average ticket around €5 million over eight to 10 years.”

The software is reportedly able to model soiling losses and cleaning benefits, while reducing cleaning costs and maximizing the overall economic performance of projects.
“PVradar is developed by a team of photovoltaic engineers and software engineers with many years of experience in the field of soiling estimation and cleaning optimization,” CEO Thore Müller told pv magazine. “PVradar is the software we wish we have had in our previous jobs.”
Developers can reportedly import detailed designs or run quick scans based on high-level descriptions of a plant. It is possible to later revise the app's settings. The next step is to assess the ambient conditions of a plant.
“To avoid teams having to analyze and format data from various sources, PVradar supports automatic import of both soiling, rain, and irradiation data from public databases,” Müller explained. “If no soiling measurements are available, the soiling conditions are estimated from satellite measurements of airborne particulate matter suspended in the air and 20 years of historic precipitation.”
The third step involve s selecting the cleaning systems and operation models. Each cleaning system is described by a set of technical parameters.
“The model includes lifetimes for each system and sub-components such as brushes, tanks, and batteries,” said Müller.
Users of the app can also choose different operating models for each cleaning technology.
“With this, the user has already completed their tasks. The software now takes over and optimizes the optimal cleaning strategy of each of the selected alternatives,” Müller said. “Based on data from the past 20 years, the algorithm first simulates the soiling level the plant would have experienced if it was only cleaned by rain. Then, and for every year individually, it finds the optimal cleaning schedule that maximizes additional revenues after additional costs.”
Virtuous-Re said it plans to eventually expand its approach to other technologies such as bifacial modules, albedo enhancers, and battery storage.

“The modules' highest conversion efficiency reaches 22.72% with the output power of 635 W,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
According to the product sheet, the new DAS-DH156NA panel comes in five versions, with power outputs between 605 W and 625 W. The power conversion efficiency ranges from 21.6% and 22.4%.

In silicon wafer and cell production, the surface of the wafer is usually given a texture of tiny pyramid shapes, which serve to reduce reflection and trap more light in the cell. This texture is usually achieved by dipping wafers into liquid chemicals, which remove some silicon and leave behind the textured surface.
Some other processes, usually involving firing a plasma substance at the silicon surface, are known to offer better control over the size and uniformity of the bumps that make up the texture. Most manufacturers, however, see these as too complex and costly, with only a limited benefit compared to the wet chemical process.
Placing a perovskite solar cell on top, however, adds new requirements for the silicon surface. Many of the achievements made so far with tandem cells have been done on a silicon cell with no texturing, which makes it easier to integrate the perovskite but represents a lost opportunity for the silicon cell efficiency. The group at HZB investigated some of the more complex texturing processes and found that the increased control and smaller surface textures they afford could solve the perovskite integration challenge, or even be of interest again for single-junction silicon cells.
“For tandem cells, a uniform and small-sized Si texture is crucial in order to be able to wet process the perovskite top cell,” the group explained. “We showed that sub-micrometer sized random pyramids by an adjusted wet etching process are an interesting approach not only for such tandem solar cells but also for SHJ single junction solar cells.”
In their paper, Double-sided nano-textured surfaces for industry compatible high-performance silicon heterojunction and perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, published in Progress in Photovoltaics, the group describes experiments with different etching solutions. They found that varying the composition of the solution enabled them to control the size of the pyramids on the surface, maintaining the desirable anti-reflective features of the etched surface, while making it easier to place the perovskite layer on top.
“All JV parameters were similar or even slightly better as compared to those of cells with our standard micro-texture,” said the group.
Using these new nano-texturing processes, the group demonstrated a 28.9% efficient tandem cell. The researchers said they are confident that such a process could be adopted at scale.
“We expect that the presented processes will be easy to be implemented in industrial production and, hence, will contribute to the development of a production process for highly efficient tandem solar cells,” they said.

Australian startup Recharge Industries, owned by the US-based Scale Facilitation fund, has acquired the assets and business of Britishvolt, which went into administration in January.
Before running out of capital earlier this year, Britishvolt had planned to build a $4.71 billion lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing plant in Cambois, northern England. At full capacity, Britishvolt’s proposed 30 GWh factory would have made enough cells for more than 300,000 lithium-ion batteries per year.
Recharge Industries has now acquired Britishvolt after finalizing a deal with its administrators. They selected Recharge Industries as their preferred bidder from a field of contenders. The financial terms of the deal have not been made public.
In January, Recharge Industries announced plans to construct a lithium-ion gigafactory in Geelong, Victoria. It plans to begin construction on the project by the end of this year. It is targeting 2 GWh of annual production in 2024, before scaling up to 30 GWh of storage capacity per year.
