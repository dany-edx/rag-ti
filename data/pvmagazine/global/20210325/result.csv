The culprit, is the battery. But what if the chassis itself was rechargeable, rather than a battery added to the structure?
Researchers from the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm claim to have taken a significant stride towards making that vision a reality. The ‘massless' batteries envisioned–so called because their weight is not added on top of a vehicle structure–have been the subject of research since 2007. The Swedish researchers say their discovery has improved such devices by a factor of ten.
Their battery features a carbon fiber negative electrode and a positive electrode made from lithium-ion-phosphate-coated aluminum foil. A fiberglass fabric separates the components which are then woven, like ordinary carbon fiber, and surrounded by an electrolyte matrix. The matrix consisted of a porous methacrylate polymer which the researchers impregnated with a liquid electrolyte of lithium salts, for high ionic conductivity.
The team has said their eureka! moment arrived through happy accident. Initially, the group had attempted to investigate the structural effects of separator thickness only to discover their approach resulted in a battery ten times better than other ‘structural'–or ‘massless'–batteries. With an energy density of 24 Wh/kg, their structural battery has just 20% of the figure boasted by conventional lithium-ion batteries. However, because the weight of a vehicle using such devices would be significantly reduced, that is of no great concern, the researchers said.
To illustrate the point, the Swedish team pointed out the 85 kWh battery in a Tesla Model S makes up around a quarter of the vehicle's weight. Plus, with massless batteries storing lower energy than conventional devices, they also comprise less of a safety risk.
In flexibility terms, the device was tested for an elastic modulus of 25 gigapascals and tensile strength exceeding 300 megapascals, and can thus compete with common construction materials, according to the researchers. “Previous attempts to make structural batteries have resulted in cells with either good mechanical properties or good electrical properties,” said Leif Asp, professor at Chalmers and leader of the project. “But here, using carbon fiber, we have succeeded in designing a structural battery with both competitive energy storage capacity and rigidity.”
With their results having been achieved by accident, the academics believe there is room for improvement. Asp suggested an energy density of around 75 Wh/kg and a stiffness of 75 gigapascals could be within reach. Electrochemical performance is limited by the mass of active materials relative to  total mass. That means achieving a higher proportion of fibers to electrolyte would improve battery performance and a more refined industrial manufacturing process could improve the fiber-to-electrolyte ratio drastically.
In terms of cycling stability, the researchers have claimed their device showed no significant capacity degradation signs after 60 cycles.
“The next-generation structural battery has fantastic potential,” said Asp. “If you look at consumer technology, it could be quite possible, within a few years, to manufacture smartphones, laptops or electric bicycles that weigh half as much as today and are much more compact.”

Voltalia submitted the lowest bid, of €0.02989/kWh, while the second shortlisted bidder, China-based Universal Energy Co Ltd, offered a price of €0.046/kWh. The ministry said 45 companies participated in the tender without revealing their names. The ceiling price for the procurement exercise had been set at €55/MWh.
The solar facility will be deployed at the Technological and Economic Development Area in the municipality of Spitallës and will cover a surface of around 120ha. It will sell 70% of the generated power to Albanian power utility Operatori i Shpërndarjes së Energjisë Elektrike SH.A. (OSHEE) under a 15-year PPA, while the remaining 30% will be sold on the spot market or through bilateral PPAs.
Voltalia had also been the winner of a tender for a 140 MW PV project in the Karavasta area, in the center of the country, which was launched in January 2020. The French solar company secured the project in May thanks to a bid of €0.02489/kWh.
“The Karavasta PV project de facto turned out to be more attractive,” Albanian energy lawyer, Lorenc Gordani, told pv magazine, adding that it is larger by 40 MW and located in an area with higher solar radiation. “Furthermore, the Karavasta project developer must sell only 50% of the generated power to OSHEE, which may also explain the difference between the two bids.” Other reasons may be the forecast scenarios related to the ongoing electricity supply and trading options resulting from the different technical studies and sensitivity analyses that companies typically perform for these projects.
Albania also supports rooftop PV through a net-metering scheme codified in June. According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Balkan country had only 10 MW of installed solar power at the end of 2019.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/25/south-korea-deployed-4-1-gw-of-solar-in-2020/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 25, 2021",South Korea deployed 4.1 GW of solar in 2020,"South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) has estimated that around 4.1 GW of new PV systems were grid connected in the country last year. If confirmed by official statistics, this result would compare to 3.8 GW in 2019 and 2.4 GW in 2018 and would make 2020 the most successful year ever recorded by the country.
At the end of December, South Korea's cumulative installed PV capacity should have reached around 15.6 GW.
Last year “marked the third year after the Korean government's 20%-renewables-by-2030 plan announcement, causing a boom in solar,” Yeji Kim, researcher at Seoul-based Solutions For Our Climate, told pv magazine. “Large scale PV plants–over 1 MW [in scale]–were built in the country for the first time but, unfortunately, we could not find the exact number of installations completed in 2020.”
According to her, however, this year's growth may be lower than that of 2020, as several regional administrations are limiting the development of utility scale projects through new regulations for project siting. Citing recent numbers from the Korea Energy Agency (KEA), the analyst said the newly installed PV capacity for the first quarter of this year reached 0.56 GW while, in the same period of 2020, new PV systems had totaled over 1 GW.
The Korea Photovoltaic Industry Association (KOPIA) recently said it expects around 3 GW of new PV will be installed in the country this year. “Despite the record growth in South Korea's solar, renewables are still strangled, unable to grow as fast as they should,” Kim added.
South Korea currently plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030. This ambitious target is expected to be achieved by building giant solar parks such as a 2.1 GW floating solar project, and a 3 GW ground-mounted PV array that was announced for the Saemangeum area by South Korean president Moon Jae-in in November 2018.
More recently, the South Korean government announced a plan to add another 2.1 GW of floating PV by 2030. Furthermore, the MOTIE is planning to allocate around 4 GW of solar capacity this year across two PV tenders, which will likely be launched in April and October. The ministry has also recently announced it wants to help development of unsubsidized solar by allowing domestic electricity consumers to buy power from renewable energy power producers through power purchase agreements (PPAs).

French automation company Sirea has installed, last year, a 21 kW solar carport for self-consumption at its facility in Castres, southern France. The installation, which was partially funded through a program for solar self-consumption promoted by the Occitanie region, is also being used for the recharging of the company's electric vehicle fleet.
Furthermore, the solar carport's self-consumption rate was optimized by linking it with 40 kW of recycled batteries provided by French specialist Phenix. This storage technology allows the company to rely on short-term storage to quickly recharge its electric vehicles without increasing the share of power taken from the electricity network.
This system configuration has now been further modified by Sirea with the addition of long-term and inter-seasonal hydrogen storage. The energy management specialist has integrated a 430 W electrolyzer to convert the surplus energy from photovoltaics into hydrogen. Up to 80 kWh of electrical energy in hydrogen, at 10 bars, can be stored. So, on days of low solar production, the system's fuel cell will de-stock hydrogen to provide the electricity needed for the building and vehicles.
“Today, the challenge for Sirea is to show that beyond technical feasibility, the compatibility of renewable energies with cleaner ways of storing energy is possible either with second-life batteries or hydrogen,” the company's CEO, Bruno Bouteille, stated. “There is a certain complementarity between these different storage technologies.”
To interact with the hydrogen storage and convey the surplus PV power towards the electrolyzer or use the fuel cell, Sirea will use its own smart management system, called SmartEMS. This controller, designed for energy management, is already fitted to several photovoltaic installations for controlled self-consumption but this will be a first for the connection of a hydrogen storage system.

While government policies have seen renewables today account for more than 3% of the nation's electricity, the advances made since the nation's RE Policy was formulated in 2008 have significantly undershot the stated ambition.
“We need to recast the policy so that renewable energy can be the main source of electricity after a certain period,” an official at government body the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) told pv magazine. “Aggressive promotion [of renewables] and [the] removal of existing and possible barriers [to adoption] will get priority in the new renewable policy.”
The government initially promoted solar home systems and other PV products to expand electricity access in the countryside, as well as arranging soft loans funded by the exchequer and international development partners to set up solar projects. The development of solar mini-grids furthered the off-grid efforts of the authorities.
In 2018, the government introduced net-metering so electricity ‘prosumers' could also supply power to the grid generated from rooftop panels, chiefly on factory buildings. The net metering regime has recently been expanded to solar irrigation pumps and the nation is also witnessing the development of scores of solar and wind power plants.
The new renewables policy will be formulated by officials with a more rounded knowledge of clean power resources, thanks to more than a decade of experience in the sector, according to SREDA chairman Mohammad Alauddin. He told pv magazine the new policy would conform with Bangladesh's renewable energy roadmap and the nation's eighth five-year plan, both of which aim to foster clean power generation.
Dipal C Barua, president of trade body the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, told pv magazine there was a need for more certainty in the new national policy, adding: “We lack an action plan to achieve the [missed 10%] generation target.”
He called for the government to set generation capacity goals for each renewable energy technology and stipulate how much should be funded by the private sector. Barua called for the establishment of a government ministry, or ministerial division, devoted to renewables, and said the new clean power policy should contain concrete fiscal and policy incentives.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/25/cooling-pv-panels-with-hvac-system-exhaust/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,LEBANON",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 25, 2021",Cooling PV panels with HVAC system exhaust,"Researchers from the Lebanese International University and the University of Nantes in France have developed a way to use cold air exhausted from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to cool off solar panels.
The solar module cooling technique can be applied in PV systems in structures that can use exhaust air from HVAC systems. Cooling is achieved through the forced convection of exhaust air on the rear sides of the panels, to absorb excess heat through heat transfer.
“The operating temperature of the PV array will be reduced due to the heat transfer between the air flow and the lower surface of the PV system, which usually has a high temperature,” the academics explained.
The technique was tested through thermal modeling on an experimental PV panel with ceria-doped glass, optical-grade adhesive, a very thin layer of silicon, a solder layer, and an aluminum nitride substrate. The scientists also conducted a parametric study by varying the cooling load of the HVAC system from 0 kW to 110 kW.
“The height of the exhaust duct (H) was taken as 0.1 m and the width (l) as 0.5 m,” the scientists explained. “The length of the PV module was taken as 0.5 m. The ambient temperature is set at 25 C while the exhaust air temperature is set to 22 C.”
They measured the wind speed on the upper part of the panels at 2 meters per second. The solar irradiance was equal to 700 W/m2.
The experiment showed that the efficiency of the PV modules rose from 11% to 18% when the cooling load increased from 0 kW to 140 kW.
“At high cooling load, the surface temperature decreases suddenly due to the high heat transfer,” they said. “However, a minimum height of the exhaust air duct must be selected to reduce the waste of air at low temperature or use a series of PV to be cooled with the same air duct.”
The researchers warned that the current system configuration favors the accumulation of dust on PV systems, which should be avoided, as it could affect PV system performance. However, they plan to split the flow of the exhaust air into two parts, with one part flowing over the lower surface and the second over the upper surface, to eliminate dust accumulation.
“The efficiency of the PV system may be enhanced by generating a turbulent flow at low Reynolds number by using a Vortex Generator,” they added. A vortex generator is a small angled plate installed on an outer surface of an aerodynamic body that can create mini wingtip vortices, which spiral through the boundary layer and free-stream airflow.
The scientists described the proposed technique in “Improving the efficiency of photovoltaic panels using air exhausted from HVAC systems: Thermal modeling and parametric analysis,” which was recently published in Cases Studies in Thermal Engineering.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/25/covid-19-and-distressed-solar-ppas-in-spain/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,EUROPE,SPAIN",,"MARCH 25, 2021",Covid-19 and distressed solar PPAs in Spain,"Over the past few years, the Spanish power market has become the epitome of subsidy-free renewables in Europe. Due to rising wholesale power prices and plummeting costs for large-scale PV, the Spanish solar market has built up an impressive subsidy-free pipeline. In 2018 and 2019, wholesale market revenues of PV projects exceeded the levelized cost of generation (LCOE) by up to €30/MWh. Against this backdrop, more than seven GW of solar PV projects signed a power purchase agreement (PPAs) within the last two years.
Historically, the Spanish power market showed an above average power price level among its European peers. Transport costs for natural gas and steam coal resulted in a premium on variable generation costs for fossil power generation compared to Central Western European markets. The revitalization of the European CO2 emissions trading system (ETS), as well as the reintroduction of the Spanish power generation tax, strengthened this trend.
When Covid-19 reached Europe in 2020, the Spanish power market was hit full force. Spot and near-term future prices fell by around 30% in just a few weeks. Electricity was traded on the spot market below €20/MWh in April 2020. This was induced by a fall in CO2 and gas prices, which dropped by around 20% to 40% compared to February, as well as a reduction of electricity demand. In the wake of anti-corona virus measures, Spanish power demand decreased by 15-20%.
Even though prices on the Spanish spot and futures markets show signs of recovery, three drivers stir uncertainty and volatility in long-term power price levels:
These market changes will impact existing PPAs, as well as on current negotiations for future PPAs. How pronounced this effect is on the former, depends on the specific terms and conditions of the PPA.
Economically, the two most important parameters that can leave a PPA in distress against the backdrop of its long-term nature are the contractual volume and price. In case of volume, the supplier is obliged to deliver a certain volume which the buyer is obliged to offtake. Furthermore, in case of a fixed-price agreement, the seller hedges himself against a decrease in market prices, but also forgoes opportunities that might arise from increasing market prices. For the buyer, the opposite holds, i.e., they hedge themselves against increasing market prices and forgoe chances stemming from decreasing market prices.
However, in 2021, Covid-19 had, and still has, a strong impact on all economic aspects in Spain, not only on the electricity market spot prices . This may lead to difficulties for the seller in making the contractual volumes available, e.g., due to construction delays. The buyer may be hit by the sharp decrease in both electricity prices as well as demand, which may be particularly burdensome e.g., for tourism/industrial consumers whose services or production has been halted.
Depending on the conditions and the risk allocation agreed upon in a particular PPA, these developments could lead to a significant shift in the contractual economic balance and put the PPA in distress, depending on how long the current situation will last. It is, therefore, of paramount importance for both sellers and buyers to assess the impact of Covid-19 on the economic balance of their PPAs and possibly initiate further steps.
Distressed PPAs are characterized by the fact that the economic disruption, i.e., the difference between PPAs and market prices, takes on extreme proportions, not only in the short term but also over a longer period of time.
When restructuring distressed PPAs, it is therefore important, in addition to the purely economic quantification of the disruption, to know one’s own legal position, in order to be well prepared for the upcoming negotiations with the contracting parties, investors, and financial institutions. Being well prepared means knowing one’s own strengths and weaknesses, in order to achieve the best possible adaptation to the new economic circumstances.
One’s own legal position, i.e., the legal room for maneuver in negotiations, is primarily determined by the contractual provisions in the PPA itself. Usually, the contracting parties have included appropriate stabilization clauses in the contract, such as “hardship”, “force majeure”, “material adverse change”, etc. In short, these are exceptional agreements that combine special legal consequences in the event of an extreme, long-term disruption together with the prerequisite of “unforeseeability” and “external influence”.
In principle and until not long ago, Covid-19 was considered an unforeseeable event and thus opened up the scope of application of stabilization clauses. This applied in any case to the power generation sector, especially with regard to plants that were recently under construction in 2020 and whose commissioning, and thus the start of electricity sales, were eventually delayed by the pandemic.
However, this only applies to contracts negotiated and concluded in Spain before March 13, 2020. Contracts relating to Spain that were concluded after this date were generally negotiated with knowledge of the possible risks posed by the pandemic, i.e.,  government-imposed restrictions (lockdown, restriction of freedom of movement, etc.).
In these cases, the requirement of “unforeseeability” does not apply because the state restrictions were known to the contracting parties as of this date. The contracting party that is prevented from performing due to governmental measures to contain the pandemic can, therefore, not invoke the contractual stabilization clauses, but is obliged to compensate the other party.
In future contracts, the potential impact of Covid-19, including the viral mutations that occur, the subsequent waves of infection, and the impact of vaccination on staff and the parties own performance obligations, should be explicitly agreed in the contract.
In contrast to power generation, PPA-based power trading cannot easily invoke Covid-19 as an exceptional event that exempts from performance (delivery or payment). While short- and medium-term changes in the market price due to the effects of the pandemic do not in principle exempt the seller from the obligation to perform (e.g., the corresponding EFET provisions), the buyer will under certain circumstances be able to enforce a reduction in the quantity delivered if it is unable to meet its purchase obligation due to government measures (e.g., closures of companies, production plants, etc.).
The decision of a company’s management team to close a plant in order to protect its staff, on the other hand, cannot be qualified as “external influence” and consequently does not release the buyer from its purchase obligation on the basis of a stabilization clause.
The legal consequences, which are foreseen or imposed either by contract or by applicable law, range from the temporary interruption of contractual obligations, through to the adjustment of obligations to the new economic situation, up to the termination of the contractual relationship.
What all these legal consequences have in common is that they override the principle of “pacta sunt servanda”, which allows the contracting parties, by way of exception, to interrupt, modify, or even terminate the contract. If no contractual agreement has been reached, the respectively applicable contract law (contract statute) must be consulted with regard to the legal consequences in the event of a massive breach of contract.
Most legal systems have such an exception (“clausula rebus sic stantibus”), either in the statute law or developed by case law, according to which adherence to the contractual obligations in the case of the above-mentioned disturbances is considered unreasonable.
In extreme cases, the insolvency of one of the contracting parties has to be expected, which in turn can regularly result in the unilateral termination of the contract by the new and external insolvency administrator. In this respect, it is essential that the planned restructuring to avoid a winding-up is bankruptcy-proof, according to the new Spanish Insolvency Law. Under certain circumstances, the restructuring will be carried out within the framework of a scheme of arrangements to prevent insolvency.
The restructuring of a PPA can be either amicable or contentious. Basically, three stages can be distinguished in the area of ADR: negotiation, mediation or commercial arbitration.
During negotiations, it is up to the contracting parties themselves to find their own conflict resolution. In practice, this often happens informally at the lower project level. Quick success is achieved without much effort and by simple means. However, a common mistake in this type of conflict resolution is the inadequate documentation of the agreement. Therefore, the contracting parties should take the time to record the agreement precisely and in writing (e.g., minutes) and simultaneously check and eventually renegotiate the drafted agreement from a legal and fiscal point of view. Experience has shown that without adequate “self-discipline” in conflict resolution, an initial “simple solution” can later turn into a complicated negotiating position that can put one party at a considerable disadvantage in contentious proceedings.
With regards to conflict resolution through negotiation, this has also undergone considerable professionalization in Spain in recent years. Well-organized companies plan and train their employees in this respect and thus achieve great economic advantages in a critical and time-sensitive conflict situation. Furthermore, if both contractual partners have agreed on a “collaborative project management”, it is possible to resolve the conflicts transparently and according to clear distribution rules (joint cost allocation via Painshare/Gainshare principle).
Mediation of a PPA dispute is characterized by the inclusion of a neutral third party in the conflict. As in negotiations between the parties, successful mediation or conciliation requires that the parties to the PPA are able to clearly define and structure the content of the matter in dispute and then, with the help of the mediator, jointly formulate restructuring solutions. The ultimate goal of PPA-mediation is the amicable resolution of the dispute by the parties involved. If this is not successful, the parties in dispute may request the help of a neutral expert to submit a (binding or non-binding) proposal for conciliation.
As an alternative to mediation, or even after a failed mediation attempt, the contractual parties to a PPA may determine, through an arbitration agreement, that an arbitration tribunal composed of one or three arbitrators shall decide their dispute around a PPA restructuring dispute. The parties may choose the arbitrators themselves, and thus take into account their particularly desired technical and/or linguistic skills and other experiences. The parties will also determine the language or languages of the proceedings, as well as the place of the proceedings. The proceedings are confidential. The decision of the arbitral tribunal, the arbitral award, binds the parties in the same way as a decision of a state court. Especially for limited conflict amounts, i.e. in disputes of up to €3 million, some arbitration institutions, e.g., ICC, have developed an abbreviated procedure that provides for a streamlined and simplified procedure.
In general, parties in a PPA may primarily decide to agree to arbitration proceedings for solving all disputes that may arise out of or relating to the PPA itself. PPAs are quite technical and specific agreements which require independent individuals with high expertise on such matters to analyze and resolve the disputes. In this regard, it is common that PPAs indeed include ICC arbitration clauses.
The venue and the language of the arbitration proceedings may differ from the parties participating in the PPA. The confidentiality of the arbitration proceedings also makes this kind of dispute resolution attractive. Out of many arbitral institutions, the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce is one of the most usual arbitrations in PPAs. Their procedures can be tailored and shortened, even more, so that solutions to disputes can be obtained in less than six months. Last but not least: the new ICC Rules 2021 provide adequate “virtual proceedings” (e.g., videoconference hearings) to cover all practical needs and protection especially with regard to Covid-19 related issues.

The research group used bathocuproine (BCP) molecules solutioned in three different organic solvents: methanol, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA). BCP is a well-known cathode interlayer exhibiting improved electron extraction as well as exciton blocking properties, which has already been utilized in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices and other perovskite cells. “In our study, the penetration of the three solvents and the BCP small molecules were observed for the first time,” research co-author, Sheng Hsiung Chang, told pv magazine. “The penetration of BCP small molecules into the PCBM thin film and the PCBM/MAPbI3 interface can increase the carrier mobility in the PCBM thin film and passivate the electron-poor defects at the PCBM/MAPbI3 interface, respectively.”
The academics spin-coated the solvents on top of the PCBM spacer, the perovskite layer, and the glass substrate, to separate the effects from the solvents and the BCP molecules. Furthermore, they used a polyelectrolyte (P3CT-Na) thin film as hole transporting material instead of commonly-used thin films based on PEDOT:PSS, which is a conjugating-based polythiophene polymer. P3CT-Na is generally claimed to improve a perovskite cell's performance due to its better crystal properties and larger grain size and the scientists said it was able to increase the cell's efficiency from 13.56% to 20.29%.
“When the ethanol or IPA is used in the solvent treatment process, the increase in the shunt resistance and the decrease in the series resistance indicate that the PCBM/MAPbI3 interfacial contact quality is improved,” they stated. “The elimination of the s-shaped characteristic in the J-V curve means that the solvents used in the treatment process can penetrate into the PCBM and MAPbI3 thin films.” An s‐shaped JV curve is obtained when the extraction of majority carriers is, for some reason, impaired.
The penetration of the solvents is said not to influence the electronic and electrical properties of the PCBM thin film, which can act as a filter in the solvent penetration process as a consequence. “The understanding of the spin-coated BCP/solvent-penetration process helps us open up a new path for increasing the photovoltaic performance of solution-processed perovskite solar cells,” the researchers concluded.
Their findings were presented in the study On the role of solution-processed bathocuproine in high-efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells, published in Solar Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/25/queensland-to-integrate-large-scale-community-batteries-into-substations/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 25, 2021",Queensland to integrate large-scale community batteries into substations,"From pv magazine Australia
The Queensland state government has announced plans to install five large-scale, network-connected batteries as part of a community battery trial. With a combined capacity of 40 MWh, the batteries will be installed at substations in Townsville, Yeppoon, Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, and Toowoomba.
With its eye-watering rooftop solar penetration – almost one in three Queenslanders living in detached houses now have solar on their rooftops – the trial is setting the stage for the government’s plan to firm up its grid by housing large-scale batteries in major substations.
“Energy Queensland-owned sites have been identified for this trial where deployment can occur as quickly and efficiently as possible, and where we are seeing the highest penetration of solar on the network,” said Queensland’s Energy Minister, Mick de Brenni. “If successful, Energy Queensland could deploy distribution batteries in locations right across the state. In the medium term, this technology means we can ‘bank’ the excess renewable energy generated allowing a continued growth in rooftop solar on the way to achieving Queensland’s renewable energy target.”
Currently, 20% of Queensland’s energy mix comes from renewables. The government is aiming to bring that up to 50% by 2030.
The government of New South Wales launched a similar trial in February. Melbourne’s Yarra Council also made a similar move in January, but focused its attention on city dwellers, while Western Australia continues to roll out community battery projects.
With Australia’s rooftop solar growth expected to exceed last year’s 3 GW record, according to the Clean Energy Regulator, governments are scrambling to make the most of abundant daytime power and avoid the solar shutdowns that have affected South Australia.
State-owned Energy Queensland already has one network-connected battery – a 4 MW/8 MWh Tesla battery – at Bohle Plains in Townsville. This new slate of batteries will include another in Townsville, to be housed at the Black River Substation.
The Yeppoon battery will be located at the Tanby Substation, while Bundaberg’s will be integrated into the Bargara Substation. Hervey Bay and Toowoomba’s batteries will be part of the Torquay Substation and Torrington Substation, respectively.

You may think that commercial solar is only for large, Fortune 500 companies with enough resources to afford millions of dollars in capital expenditures. The good news is that this is not the case. Middle-market companies can also benefit from solar and are increasingly expected to do so by large companies seeking to reduce the environmental impact of their supply chains.
Mid-scale companies can more effectively position themselves with their customers and drive significant savings or tax benefits by going solar. And many have done so already – the amount of solar capacity installed across the United States has grown tenfold over the past decade, and some people are already calling the 2020s “the solar decade.”
Even so, many attractive opportunities remain. In the United States, solar energy installations can help roughly 70% of businesses reduce operating costs and meet environmental goals in the 2020s. Here are a few simple steps you can use to evaluate return on investment and begin developing a successful solar energy installation for your business.
Evaluate your property
First, you should own the property or have control of the roof. If you lease, a landlord-tenant deal can be pursued, but would require additional coordination. Your rooftop should have ample room (typically greater than 50,000 square feet) with direct sunlight for an effective solar energy system to be installed. Most commonly, commercial solar installations are placed on large, flat, unobstructive rooftops, without shading from surrounding trees or other structures.
Second, if a rooftop installation does not work, solar panels can also be considered for parking areas. With solar canopies, employee and customer vehicles enjoy the additional benefit of protection from weather and UV rays. And it is also straightforward to incorporate additional features such as lighting or EV charging stations.
Third, businesses with under-utilized land may also consider a ground-mounted solar panel installation, although environmental studies and trenching may add to the cost of the project.
Electricity costs
Before meeting with potential solar vendors, it is recommended that you compile the last year of your property’s utility bills. This includes the monthly kilowatt-hour (kWh) consumption, electricity rates, and total billed amounts.
The average commercial or industrial rate for electricity nationwide is roughly $0.09/ kWh. If your rate is higher, solar could be a good option to realize savings. Even when it’s lower, many variables can still make solar worthwhile.
Keep in mind that solar energy systems are designed to be long-term assets with stable, predictable benefits, and there are numerous benefits beyond financials.
Identify incentives
When considering solar, the two obvious benefits are financial and environmental. As consumer and international businesses now consider the environmental impact of their decisions, the line between these two benefits is beginning to blur, as markets are likely to reward those who go green.
The Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), historically a 30% credit, is set to provide a tax credit equivalent to 26% of a solar installation’s total costs this year. This is set to further fall to 10% in 2024 and remain at that level thereafter.
